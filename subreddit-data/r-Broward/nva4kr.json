    "postText": "I recently have been offered a job in Plantation, FL. My wife lived in Tampa, but neither of us has been to the Miami area. We currently live in the midwest. We are wondering what the town is like to live in or areas nearby we should consider. I am concerned about the high crime rate in Plantation. We have a son who is going into the 7th grade. We are looking at private schools and would also like recommendations. I appreciate any help or advice you all could offer. We are looking for a quiet suburban lifestyle but close enough to work which looking at google maps, is roughly around where the 838 and 441 meet near the Fort Lauderdale Country Club. We have a combined salary of around $220,000 per year and are looking to buy at least a three-bedroom home. Thanks in advance.",

It makes a big difference on where you choose to live because our public schools are based on zoning.\n\nMany are suggesting Weston.  Weston is great and has good public schools. However, your housing dollars don't go very far there. A small SFH in Weston will generally cost $500K or more. Keep in mind that in South Florida, our property taxes and insurance are **MUCH** higher than the midwest.  In a $500K home, you'll pay approximately $10K per month for tax and $6K for insurance -- approximately $1,500/month in escrow. \n\nPlantation, Sunrise, and Tamarac all have great, very safe neighborhoods as long as you stay west of University Drive.  And, you'll get much a better home for the price than in Weston.  However, the public schools in those cities are pretty scary. Generally, anyone with means either sends their kids to private school or navigates the very tricky job of getting their kids into one of the few charter schools. \n\nIf you're going the public school route, Cooper City or Davie are probably your best bet.  They're slightly more expensive than Plantation, Sunrise or Tamarac, but much cheaper than Weston.  And, I would argue their public schools are actually better than Weston.  However, be careful with either because there are small pockets in both cities zoned for crappy schools.  Don't trust realtors to tell you (they're generally clueless and the zones change from time to time); do your own research. Here's the very valuable Broward school zoning maps:\n\nhttps://www.browardschools.com/boundarymaps\n\nFor private schools, they're generally great, but expensive.  American Heritage is great, but costs $31K/year.  Nova and University School are good but costs $27K and $28K respectively. \n\nIMHO, if you're going private, the best route is the Catholic schools. St Gregory, St David, and St Bonaventure are all *only* $7K per year and offer really great middle schools. Those schools generally feed into St Thomas Aquinas or Archbishop McCarthy High Schools. The tuition at both are only $13,500/year. Keep in mind you don't have to be Catholic to send your son to those schools, but he will definitely be in the minority.",

I hope more people will leave feedback.\n\nFor those not aware, [Broward MPO](https://www.browardmpo.org/about-the-mpo) is a public federally mandated agency that helps the county make policies on transportation. Which means they are supposed to guide us on where to spend money, as far as roads and public transit.\n\nMore food for thought: Broward is one of the most dangerous counties in the nation when it comes to road safety. We really need to tell our local officials that we need better infrastructure and public transit, because simply widening every road we have will not relieve traffic in the long term, it will induce demand.",

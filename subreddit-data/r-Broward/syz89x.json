            "comment": " several articles use the words \"problematic\" \"behavioral issues\" frequently to describe that ex girlfriend/fianc\u00e9e. she has an exclusive media deal already lined up, that is her meal ticket. \n her many different versions of the \"truth\" make it impossible to believe her. Rafael Azulay served near his max sentence despite that girl's refusal to cooperate and giving conflicting statements in court. The shooting of both Azulay and Azulay senior have absolutely nothing to do with her. She however has continued to harass the giving family of Asher Azulay including using their identities for scams. Don't believe everything someone who was not honest in court preceeding is claiming to media. She is not a witness, she was not involved in the family dispute.",

I know their shtick is being downhome but they need tobgrow a pair and limit people in the door.",

I have visited (several times) since the Pandemic started and they do actually have distancing at the tables (once your mask is off and you are eating). They started outdoor seating (in place of the rocking chairs). Tables are cleaned and sanitized after patrons leave. Masks are required to enter the establishment and they have staff at the front door to enforce this.\n\nI understand that after last weekend's debacle at The Wharf, everyone is trying to jump on the \"down with restaurants\" bandwagon, but in this case, the mask wearing *is* being enforced. Just remember that we wear the masks for the times when we can't social distance.\n\nAll the managers and staff are super nice, and they are really struggling to get through this. They have had to cut staff by about 60% to stay in business.",

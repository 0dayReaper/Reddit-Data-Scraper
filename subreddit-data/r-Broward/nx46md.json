    "postText": "So I'm looking to buy my first condo in Pembroke Pines. Mainly because it's quiet/safe and also would cut my commute to Ft Lauderdale significantly from Hialeah. \n\nI see a lot of places for sale between I-75 and Flamingo Road starting at 99k. Honestly seems like a bargain.\n\nAnyone who lives there want to chime in? Or suggest another great area cheap area?\n\nEdit: clarified the area",

That\u2019s more of a boca things though. \n\nLook at the HOA fees. And if you get serious look at the financials to make sure they have healthy finances.\n\nFor safety drive around or check the neighbor rater map. \n\nGood luck/not a realtor lol",

I like it a lot.\n\nIt used to be quite boring, but Pembroke Gardens brought out a small amount of nearby nightlife and you\u2019re never too far away from miami or ft laud. Def check out the neighborhood and HOA fees and all that, but I don\u2019t think theres nearly anything thats poor quality west of 75.",

My mom lives in Pembroke Falls and all that area is nice, lots of things to do, CB Smith park is a very nice park, also the Costco, BJ's,Trader Joe's, and Total Wine are all nearby.\nAround Pembroke Falls they have town houses, check those out, I believe those are for anybody at any age.",

Definitely check out fees because any bargain in Broward will probably have some kind of silly fee associated with the property. Sometimes they can be ridiculously high. Property management companies love to gouge tenants and home owners in West Broward just for seeking the privilege of feeling like you're middle class.",

Whatever happens in Dade usually does not creep up to broward or at least not to Pines. \n\nThe poster above probably is accurate about the fees though.",

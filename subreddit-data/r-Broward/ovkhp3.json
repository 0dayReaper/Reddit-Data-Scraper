Despite still being very careful, the virus got us. 4 adults all got COVID. 3 of the 4 kids tested positive as well. Be safe, please, everyone. In the immortal words of Cardi B, that shit is real!\n\nThat being said, 1 of the 4 adults was completely asymptomatic. The other 3 of us never went to the hospital and certainly weren\u2019t in critical condition. It was NOT fun (you don\u2019t want to get it) but I have to trust that having the vaccine is why none of us ended up in the hospital.\n\nBe smart and be safe!",

We never found out but if it was the Delta variant, but assume it was\u2026 I think that one gets past the vaccine a little more than the original strain. Note that I took and failed one course in microbiology about 15 years ago, so those are my credentials here.",

The most vulnerable. They may be in danger now.\n\nPlease: If you got your vaccine first, have your antibodies checked and talk to your doctor about getting some kind of booster if they're low.

Hasn't been this cold of a winter in a long time, and now that the sun is starting to beat again the fruit plants are really blossoming like crazy.  My lime tree has 10x as many blooms as normal.",

But the baby avocados come after that. \nI went back to check the pictures on my phone and we were starting to see the avocados around the end of April. By the beginning of July we picked a total of 6 avocados because one or two fell to the ground and went bad.\nThey had a bright green skin, they looked amazing. We let them ripe as they were not soft to the touch, we were expecting the skin to turn dark like the ones at the store, but they all went bad. We never got to try them :-(\nOur tree is the \"Black Gold\" kind, we bought it at a nursery in Davie.\n\nLet me know which kind of tree you have.",

Last year we had like 3 little avocado's but a rain storm knocked them off. Its a little tree, so I can't see it being that old. Its flowering now and ton of them, but no leaves, I was worried it would die, because trees need leaves right? lol",

Now is higher than my roof (1 story house). \n\nLike u/OneOfALifetime mentioned it was very cold and it shed the leaves so those flowers are going to become leaves.\n\nI read somewhere that the first harvest for avocado tree is no good. This year should start bearing some fruit. I will post when they start to appear.\n\nWhen I go to the backyard with the dogs I see bees pollinating the tree. Do you see the same?",

That means that the teachers in the classroom, to the greatest extent possible,\u201d said Broward Superintendent Robert Runcie. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna have them teaching online and teaching in the classroom simultaneously.\u201d\n\n&gt;Runcie shared that video on social media, asking parents to fill out a survey about their plans for the second semester.\n\n&gt;The survey will be open through next Monday.\n\n&gt;The superintendent added that in the two months since schools have been open, it\u2019s clear they\u2019re not a significant source of coronavirus spread.\n\nSo basically, \"eeeeeh I'm not sure, let's just open schools.\"",

As opposed to a nothing article then jumping to all sorts of ridiculous conclusions...  Can you tell me where that article says \"fully reopening\"?  Because that's not, at all, what was said.\n\nThey want more students, the failing ones, and can double students and still be at just 50% and safely distanced.  At the same time, instead of teachers doing both online and in classroom at the same time like now, separating this to a more traditional classroom with a different teacher handling online only.  \n\nWe do actually track children's progress. And they are falling behind, it's a disaster, along with serious mental health concerns. \n\nWhat's stupid about addressing and fixing that?\n\nhttps://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/broward-school-district-urges-parents-to-allow-students-to-return-for-in-person-learning/2343734/",

This has to do with incompetent school boards and the lack of educational infrastructure in the state of Florida. The fact that we have school boards all over the state giving themselves raises, and administrators giving themselves bonuses and pats on the back because of a serious lack of oversight in the system lead to all of this. There are plenty of ways to support the schooling from home system until vaccines are rolled out and we're not in the dead center of the fucking red in terms of COVID stats. You just haven't thought about any of this because you think there's a binary opinion on this: either go back to school or I want kids to suffer.",

You read a study that it's more difficult for kids to transmit the diseases to each other and then decided that school are COVID sanctuaries. The problem is just because it's not as easy for a student population to get wrecked by COVID doesn't mean they're not carrying the disease and spreading it to adult personnel in schools, spreading it at home, and spreading it elsewhere. \n\n&gt;Do you want children to suffer?\n\nDo you have the emotional capacity to have a serious discussion about this without ridiculous hyperbole and making weird, stretching connections between waiting for these vaccines to be rolled out nationwide and \"wanting children to suffer\"?",

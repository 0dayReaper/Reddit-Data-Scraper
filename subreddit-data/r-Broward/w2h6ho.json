It first was the service charge, then the tip included, kitchen surcharge and now the temporary inflation. \n\nBusinesses like these don't deserve to be in business in the first place. Paying guests pay way too much for what is being sold already. If they can't make a profit with the prices that they are selling, then it shouldn't be the customer's fault not responsibility to chip in.",

Fortunately I can cook better than almost any restaurant and its much cheaper to do so than the prices they are charging. For example, got charged $9 for guac and chips this past weekend. While the service was ok, and the price is not an issue otherwise, the actual quality was awful. It was basically mashed avocados with maybe a 1/10th of a chopped onion. No cilantro. No lime. Didn't taste any salt.   \n\n\nYou get extra money if you continue to deliver. If you, as a business, in any way start charging inflated prices, and simultaneously decrease in other ways, I'm out.",

Puerto Ricans went 34% to 55% Republican. Rest of Hispanics 34% to 50%\n\nPuerto Ricans are 21% of Florida Hispanics. Cubans are 28%\n\n&gt;Florida Latinos are diverse, especially when compared to U.S. Latinos (Figure 1). Latinos of Cuban descent represent the single largest Latino ancestry group (28%), while Puerto Ricans (21%), South Americans (18%), Mexicans (14%), and Dominicans (4%) round out the top 5 groups by origin. In contrast, U.S. Latinos are majority Mexican (62%), while Puerto Ricans, South Americans, Cubans, and Dominicans respectively represent 10% or less of the Latino population.\n\nhttps://latino.ucla.edu/research/15-facts-latinos-florida/",

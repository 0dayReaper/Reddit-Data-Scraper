    "postText": "Hi. As the title suggests I am selling a ton of furniture and would preferably like it to go to all one spot but am willing to sell individual pieces.\n\nI am selling a red couch (no pull out but is comfortable and trendy)\n\nI am also selling this exact bedroom set: https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdx/orren-ellis-amezcua-standard-configurable-bedroom-set-orel8219.html Everything in that is included except for the taller 5 piece dresser. I have the 6 drawer dresser, the headboard and bed frame and the side table.\n\nI am also selling a coffee table with an opening top.\n\nI am wanting to sell this stuff for about $300 for all of it. Truthfully just want it gone. It\u2019s in Flagler village. Will be heading over later to take pictures and can send anyone that is interested in buying it pictures.\n\nI am willing to sell individual pieces as well. About $100 for each item.\n\nPM me if interested\n\nEdit: here are some photos of the couch I don\u2019t have any like of it directly but here are some of what it looks like. Also the photo of the entire living room has a picture of the coffee table.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/pYB8Afm https://imgur.com/F7EQqXL https://imgur.com/qhUFAMp",

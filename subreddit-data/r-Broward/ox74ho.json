School board is going to rely on the Teacher's Union to fight the battle. They will because the teachers shouldn't be going into unsafe situations... but then DeSantis is going to play that up to his base and to the media that it's the union's fault and that the teachers are refusing to do their jobs. The whole thing will amount to nothing, but DeSantis will be able to frame it as him trying to get schools up and running and teachers being recalcitrant snowflakes.\n\nAs always- the plan is to create a media frenzy that will enrage his base.",

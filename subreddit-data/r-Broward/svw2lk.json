Covering the Broward County canals makes no sense. It would be massively expensive and would be met with massive resistance. \n\nSouth Florida is not a good place for solar farms. Central Florida, however, would be a very good place, particularly in areas where farming is no longer happening.\n\nAlso, Stanislaus County has more sunshine on average per day than Broward.\n\nThis is apples and crabapples.",

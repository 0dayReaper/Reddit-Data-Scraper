I would like to see much more especially considering were public opinion is on medical and legalization.",

I've manually approved a few of your comments over the last year or so because they were on-topic, appropriate, and didn't otherwise appear to violate reddit or sub rules. Maybe your account was previously hacked, maybe you deserved it, or maybe you didn't; I don't know. You may consider checking out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowBan/comments/7ojg1j/shadowbanned_and_not_sure_how_to_appeal/) on ways you might appeal your shadowban directly with reddit if you've been unjustly shadowbanned. Good luck.",

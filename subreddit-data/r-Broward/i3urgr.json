    "postText": "I have had a persistent medical issue involving SEVERE excessive daytime sleepiness for 2 and a half years that has made my life extremely difficult. I have been to a couple doctors for it and every one has basically just shrugged and told me I should do yoga and meditate in case it\u2019s stress, even though I am not stressed. One did bloodwork to check my thyroid but when that came back normal, they just told me to do yoga again. There has been no further exams, no further tests, absolutely nothing. I feel extremely neglected by the doctors I have seen and I have lost so much faith and trust in doctors because of it. If I get told to do yoga one more time I am going to seriously lose my mind and start throwing hands. It is not just stress, I am only 20, I should be full of energy, this is not normal. I have either an advanced sleep disorder or some underlying medical issue that is causing constant fatigue that not even 16 hours of sleep will touch and I need to get it addressed so I can function again.\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for doctors in the county that actually give a shit, and will actually work to get to the bottom of my symptoms and help me? Not just take my blood pressure and then try to sell me new-age snake oil? Thanks in advance.",

If you are sleeping that much, it\u2019s very likely you have a disorder like sleep apnea or REM disorder which is preventing you from getting adequate rest. \n\nBroward Health and International Institute of Sleep both have locations here.",

I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s apnea as I have never snored or woken up gasping for air, but based on my own research I\u2019ve been pretty suspicious of type 2 narcolepsy. Regardless, I think a sleep study would be extremely helpful. \n\nUnfortunately though, my insurance requires that sleep studies be set up via referral from a primary care doctor in order for it to be covered. I can\u2019t just go straight to a clinic or I\u2019d be paying out of pocket, which I cannot afford. Since the doctors I\u2019ve seen so far have been so flippant, I haven\u2019t been able to get such a referral yet. But I\u2019m hoping that if I can find a good doctor who will take me seriously, they will either find the problem there or provide such a referral. I\u2019ve gotten two recommendations for doctors so far so I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that I may get a study done in the near future.",

It saves them time, and you\u2019ll walk out with your referral. Good luck getting to the bottom of your issue!",

And it\u2019s nice to hear that someone else understands the frustration. I\u2019m so tired of struggling with this and it\u2019s infuriating how flippant most doctors are.\n\nAnd I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not anemic. I did consider that, and my mother suggested it because she used to be anemic when she was younger and noticed similarities in how I was feeling as well. But one of the doctors I went to did run bloodwork mainly to check my thyroid levels but also took a look at everything else involving my blood, it was the only test they ran. They said everything was perfect, no deficiencies or anything, so that pretty much ruled out anemia I think. I\u2019d imagine they\u2019d have seen I was low on iron if that was the case.",

Just keep pushing until you get the treatment you need. It took me 4 years to find a doctor who would treat a condition I had that got worse and worse until I needed surgery. So just keep advocating for yourself.",

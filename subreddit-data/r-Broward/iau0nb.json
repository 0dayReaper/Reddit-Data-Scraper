    "postText": "Hello Broward,\n\nAnyone know a place where they can match paint color on my car? First time doing this, and I rather not go to the dealer. \n\nI don\u2019t want to repaint the ENTIRE car, but touch up a few spots. I also have some minor dents, and the roof feels dry (like the gloss is deteriorating). My car is a 2014 grey Volkswagen Golf, is that helps. \n\nThank you for any information!!",

Like off the factory truck, outside and inside (they messed up a lot of my interior) - highly recommend them and will be going there in the future.",

But, the tldr is that the administration would always choose proprietary software, because it requires less-learning in order to use. The staff would do this, despite the security costs, and despite the charter of the institution. There was no system by which reasoned arguments could rise to the top of the administration, because reasoned arguments are necessarily exclusionary. \n\nSimilarly, advocacy for bitcoin utility was similarly removed.\n\nThe schools will optimize for iced cream, instead of broccolli. And as a result, this is the standard of propriety that we can expect from them.",

How many MAJOR corporations and/or government agencies have been hacked that have 100x the budget for cyber security.\n\nAnything can and will be hacked.  They could do everything you mentioned and still be hacked.  There have been massive hacks in the last decade, way bigger than this, with companies that had ten times more security.  You just gotta stay vigilant and try to make sure you keep track of everything to see if your identity is being used fraudulently, because guess what, it's all going to get out.  Just assume that all your info is out there, because it is.  So you just gotta do what you can to make sure you make it as hard as possible for anyone that has that data to use it.\n\nI'm a nobody and I get tons of failed login attempts to my email every month.  Your info has been out there for a long time.",

All the boat rental places I've found online rent powerboat or they're charters with a captain. I'm interested in something in the \\~35' range. TIA!",

Like most charter boat programs, the boats are actually owned by individuals who put them into day charter in order to offset their costs. I suspect most folks around here that want to charter their boat probably keep them in the Caribbean rather than local.\n\n[https://harborsailboats.com](https://harborsailboats.com)\n\nBTW, I would think the liability insurance would be higher on a powerboat given the greater speeds involved and I've found lots of places that rent powerboats.",

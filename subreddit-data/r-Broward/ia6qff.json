Because the Jamaicans and Islanders I know remember this:\n\nhttps://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/debra-heine/2019/02/20/kamala-harriss-jamaican-father-slams-her-for-propagating-fraudulent-stereotype-of-a-pot-smoking-jamaicans-n63944\n\nhttp://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/lead-stories/20190216/pot-smoking-joy-seekerus-presidential-hopeful-kamala-harris-faces\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/feb/19/kamala-harris-jamaican-father-donald-harris-rips-2/\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/20/kamala-harris-father-pot-1176805\n\n Kamala Harris made headlines last week when she joked in a radio interview that of course she smoked marijuana in her younger years: \u201cHalf my family\u2019s from Jamaica. Are you kidding me?\u201d\n\nBut the crack didn\u2019t go over well with at least one Jamaican: Donald J. Harris, her father.\n\nThe elder Harris sent an unsolicited statement to Kingston-based Jamaica Global Online, for which the emeritus professor of economics at Stanford University wrote a recent essay on his family\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cMy dear departed grandmothers (whose extraordinary legacy I described in a recent essay on this website), as well as my deceased parents, must be turning in their grave right now to see their family\u2019s name, reputation and proud Jamaican identity being connected, in any way, jokingly or not with the fraudulent stereotype of a pot-smoking joy seeker and in the pursuit of identity politics,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cSpeaking for myself and my immediate Jamaican family, we wish to categorically dissociate ourselves from this travesty,\u201d he added.\n\nKamala Harris\u2019 campaign had no comment.\n\nHarris\u2019 parents separated when she was young and divorced a few years later. Though Donald Harris remained a part of his children\u2019s lives, Kamala Harris and her sister were raised by their mother.\n\nIn the interview with \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d podcast, Kamala Harris cited her Jamaican heritage when asked to respond to those who believe she\u2019s opposed to legalizing marijuana. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d she said.\n\nHarris said she smoked a joint in college. \u201cAnd I inhaled,\u201d she added, a joking reference to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s comment on the campaign trail in 1992 that he smoked marijuana but didn\u2019t inhale.\n\nDonald Harris, who did not respond to requests for comment, worked with the Jamaican website\u2019s administrator when he was consulting and writing about the economy there in the 1990s.\n\nIn an email reviewed by POLITICO, Donald Harris indicated he wasn\u2019t interested in discussing the issue further publicly: \u201cI have decided to stay out of all the political hullabaloo by not engaging in any interviews with the media,\u201d he wrote.",

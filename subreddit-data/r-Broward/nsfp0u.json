    "postText": "It seems like within the past year or so, a bevy of \"seafood\" or \"crab\" restaurants have opened. I'm not talking about Rustic Inn or other of those types which has been here forever. These are all Louisiana style/Asian owned and operated places with the boil in the bag.\n\nI haven't been to any yet because of the COVID and it's not the type of food I'd want for take out. \n\nBut I'm looking forward to trying some of them. I'm curious though that it seems like a whole bunch opened relatively recently.",

My mother in law didn't think to enquire what gender crabs were being served because nobody generally serves females... and I think you know where this is going. Poor girl serving seemed absolutely clueless to the whole thing. \n\nRiggins is our go to, Rustic is fine if you want to sit on the water but comes 2nd in terms of the food. There was a small place in Hollywood a few years ago that was fantastic, but they just didn't seem to be able to attract a crowd. That was a real shame.",

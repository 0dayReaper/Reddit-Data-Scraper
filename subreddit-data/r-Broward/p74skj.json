That\u2019s $3000 just for the people to show up and take a picture. Does not include administration fees, overhead, subcontracting camera work, creating signage. I would estimate $10-15k just for this. Maybe more. And I\u2019m not even saying it\u2019s a bad thing they\u2019re doing, but money would be so much more wisely spent on roads and infrastructure rather than nonsensical pandering that benefits and does nothing. Give Indian americans safer roads and neighborhood, not bs holidays.",

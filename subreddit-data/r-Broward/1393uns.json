            "comment": "I had a lengthy discussion with my SRO and principals about this. The county it trying to take a step by step (gradually increasing in cost) approach to making safer schools.\n\nThe clear back packs where originally meant to be used in conjunction with metal detectors and uniforms. The clear backpacks are meant to encourage those who are going to bring a weapon to school to do so on there person. The idea is the weapon would hopefully be smaller or lower capacity to be concealed into the school.\n\nWhen the clear backpacks fail they\u2019ll start mandating uniforms. First students then employees. The thinking is if someone is carrying a concealed weapon it should be early to spot in a uniform. \n\nWhen this fails metal detectors will be mandated. Starting with high schools and working down to elementary. \n\n\nWhen the detectors fail (likely do to staffing shortages) more campus monitors will need to be hired then training/licensing. \n\nWhen that fails the county will invest in retrofitting or replacing old schools with  adequate infrastructure. Wall\u2019s, camera, screening points ext. \n\nThe county is a titan running at full speed. To get it to turn in the wright direction takes a long time or a lot money.\n\nOr everyone will agree that we need stronger guns laws and regulations.",

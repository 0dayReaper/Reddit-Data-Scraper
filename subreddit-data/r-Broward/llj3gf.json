I got so tired of dealing with such shitty attitudes that I now use my phone's hot spot for my internet and to use my laptop.   I don't watch TV so not having cable is OK.  Saves a lot of money also and you don't support these two corporations that don't give a dam about your service problems.",

Unless you can get AT&amp;T fiber.  \n\nThen you have some surrounding areas that have Bluestream previously Advanced.  Coral Springs, Weston.  I dont have experience with them or a company, but no news is good news...I don't hear much bitching about them.",

You can go through the hoops of cancelling after the first year if you find a better deal.\n\nEdit: Stay away from Atlantic broadband.  A neighborhood near mine has a contract with them and everyone complains about connection losses that can last a half hour.\n\nComcast is harder to deal with than AT&amp;T, and I honestly would avoid them even if they offered a better deal.",

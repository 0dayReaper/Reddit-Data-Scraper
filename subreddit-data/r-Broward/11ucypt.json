    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019m going to be starting a job near Weston in a few months and I\u2019m looking for a rental apartment nearby for one person.\n\nEverything seems very expensive in the area with prices upward of 3,000-4,000 a month.\n\nAre there any cheaper but still safe and livable apartments/studios nearby? My starting salary will be roughly 55k.\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "This relates to an investigative report a few years ago about how the Sunrise Police Department was deliberately  persuading non-local suspects to come into the city of Sunrise.  The police were hoping that they could arrest these individuals and then use the notorious asset forfeiture laws to then confiscate their property (cash, car, etc.).  When the story hit the news, the citizens of Sunrise were royally pissed that the police were inviting non-local criminals into their city.  The police promptly halted this corrupt scheme as a result of this popular demand.    \n  \nThe cop in the linked story appears to be the whistle-blower who brought this corrupt scheme to the attention of an investigative reporter at the Sun-Sentinel.  These charges are basically revenge charges by the Police Department against the guy who blew the whistle on the Police Department's corruption.",

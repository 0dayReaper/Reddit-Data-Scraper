We have to work across the aisle. We have to talk to people across the aisle. You want me to just go in there and be a puppet of somebody else? I got elected to office to represent my district, not to be a mimic of every other Democrat or every other Republican.\u201d\u201d\n\nSeems like you D\u2019s can learn something from this woman.",

Omphroy is delusional.   \n   \n&gt; *Democrats in Tallahassee have viewed Omphroy warily, after she started building a record that included voting with Republicans on controversial measures, such as a 2020 bill to require parental consent for minors to have abortions.*",

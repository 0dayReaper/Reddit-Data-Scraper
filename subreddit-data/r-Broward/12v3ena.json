I\u2019m currently looking for a rental in Broward and there just isn\u2019t that much available. I have an agent with access to listings but maybe there\u2019s another way? Is it worth calling developments? Is there any local apps aside from Zillow, Redfin, etc? Any tips would be greatly appreciated.",

If you have experience in engineering or leadership, go work at one of the tech companies around here, so that a halfway decent living arrangement becomes realistic for you. \n\nAlso, your agent is going to be a lot more helpful than random people on Reddit.",

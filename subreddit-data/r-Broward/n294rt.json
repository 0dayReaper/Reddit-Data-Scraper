    "postText": "Hey all, \n\nI am a journalist writing about the transgender athlete ban that lawmakers passed this week. I'm looking to speak with any athletes who would be affected, or their parents or teammates. I would not publish anything about someone's story without their explicit consent. If you or someone you know would be willing to share their story with me, they can send me a message here on Reddit, DM me on Twitter (@bybbaitinger) or reach out via email at [bbaitinger@sunsentinel.com](mailto:bbaitinger@sunsentinel.com).",

Or it's equally as possible that there are current athletes who don't want to talk to the press and out themselves and place a target on their backs when they're already in jeopardy of others jumping at this new opportunity to kick them off their team.",

The Florida law now prohibits them from competing.  So if college x comes to Florida to play FSU in football and college x has a trans athlete on their team then FSU must forfeit.  That will be fun don\u2019t you think?  It is just as though Florida passed a law saying Florida schools get a first down after 5 yards instead of 10.  If you are a NCAA member school you must comply with all NCAA rules or drop out of the NCAA.",

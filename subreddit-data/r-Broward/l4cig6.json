    "postText": "We were doing a quick upturn on SW 15th Terrace when we saw a ferret running down the road along the fence line. I was able to pick it up and it is friendly and clean. I knocked on the doors of the small apartment complex off SW 15th Terrace but no one owned a ferret or knew any neighbors with one. Hoping that someone see this and has any info.\n\nUpdate: As some of you suggested I contacted Donna at Broward Ferret Rescue and she was able to take him in while looking for his owner. I placed signs up around the area I found him with Donna's contact info so hopefully the owner sees one and gets reunited with him. I would post a photo of him but I'm worried someone could use it to try to claim him which is also why I left the photo off the signs.",

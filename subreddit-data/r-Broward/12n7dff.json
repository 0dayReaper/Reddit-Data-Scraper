If Broward instead had very high voter turnout, that would offset the low-population rural red counties of North Florida and tip the Governor's race Democratic.  \n   \nTake a look at the Andrew Gillum vs. Ron DeSantis election in 2018:   \n   \n&gt; *Gillum's margin of defeat was just 34,000 votes (0.4%), making the election one of the closest gubernatorial races in modern American history.*   \n   \nHigher voter turnout in heavily populated Broward County would have easily prevented DeSantis from ever entering the Governor's mansion.",

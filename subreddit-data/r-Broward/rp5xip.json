    "postText": "Right now, the absolute best option at my address is Blue Stream, which has been ***the*** single worst internet service provider (ISP) that my family and I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. And that's saying a lot coming from a past Spectrum customer.\n\nAnyways, I also noticed that while companies such as Xfinity and ATT are able to service this address, they only provide speeds of up to 75Mbps, and **zero** fiber options. This is very strange because these companies are known to provide much better services than Blue Stream (or Spectrum), and definitely have the money to expand into Coral Springs. And I know for a fact people would ditch Blue Stream in an instant for a better ISP. So what gives? Why are there so few options for internet service in this city?\n\nAfter calling the ISPs themselves, I found out that it is the city of Coral Springs itself that does not allow certain ISPs from rolling out the infrastructure that they need in order to provide their services to more addresses. I don't know if this is because of some exclusivity deal with Blue Stream or something, but I ***do*** know that it is bullshit anti-consumer behavior and actively hurts the residents of Coral Springs that depend on the internet every day, whether it's for their jobs, communication, or simply leisure activities.\n\nSo who do I email/call/write to in order to ask for this to change?",

Every time I also call to cancel because I hear about another ISP offering something better, they always match that offer and add some coupon for like a year or so. Done that like 4 or so years in a row. The past month there's been like 5 outages in my area usually at 3 am so it disrupts the only time I get to play video games. But otherwise, they push the phone, cable, and wifi promotions down your throat. It does come out cheaper overall if you want that, but I'm comfy with metro PCS for phone and no cable at all. I believe it is fiber as well but not 100%  sure",

When I worked for Comcast I lived in Coral Springs and I was supposed to receive free service as part of my employment but because I was a Advanced Cable customer rather than a Comcast customer, there wasn't anything they could do. \n\nI tried for a couple of years to get AT&amp;T or Comcast in my area and they just kept telling me they're not allowed to bring services in there. In your area they may have changed to allow those providers to come in however because they've only recently gained access to that area they have not invested in the infrastructure.\n\nI'm over in North Lauderdale/ Tamarac area and they just brought AT&amp;T fiber in this zone about 4 years ago. I would just try to reach out to AT&amp;T and hound them about fiber services in your area. If they get enough requests they might prioritize bringing services to your area.\n\nEdit: Spelling/Punctuation",

Thank you for confirming my suspicions.\n\nAs for hounding ATT, I actually already tried that. I was told that they (as well as other ISPs) were being actively prohibited by the city from laying out better infrastructure.",

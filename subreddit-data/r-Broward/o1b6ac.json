Son attends school ~ in the Hollywood area and it would be great to not having to drive too far. I\u2019ve been driving around, calling inquiring about 2bed rooms and they just are so expensive 1900+.\nI\u2019m looking for something around $1300 can even do $1500 but really not trying to live pay check to pay check with such expensive rent or drain all my savings. If anyone knows of anywhere (Hollywood,Miramar, Cooper City, Pembroke Pines) that\u2019s not really crime infested or even know of a realtor that can help please let me know.",

At the moment they are over 78000 units short of low and middle income housing.\n\nBut the news is it's only going to get worse. With a government spending so much more money than they are bringing in and inflation tagging you every which way but loose. And on top of that this $15 minimum wage push going on. And then the influx of new yorkers and other Yankee type people wanting to move to our area. It's just going to keep getting worse",

It's a sellers market for a number of reasons, and you might end up only finding efficiencies in that price range. I'm trying to help my parents move and prices are skyrocketing. \n\nI'm not trying to get you down, but be ready to manage your expectations.",

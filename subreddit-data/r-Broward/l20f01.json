    "postText": "Hi, I am a university student and was planning on applying to work for after/before care for Broward County. I have some questions and was wondering if it's difficult to get hired and what the experience is like, as well as what the pay is. I've worked for Broward County before but not with anything relating to schools (parks and recreation), and I'm interested in working with the program since it'll be a start with working in the school system as I'm planning to work in education as a teacher after I graduate. I know this may be a hit or miss for responses but just thought I'd post and ask. Thank you in advanced!",

It was extremely easy back then and just had to watch a few videos and take a training class before I got a job at a public elementary school. But things may have changed now. Seems like it was a job that in demand, and I was hired as an 18 year old.",

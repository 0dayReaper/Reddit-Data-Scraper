Depends on how to look at it.\n\nIf you have ***x-amount*** of money, and you ***need to/want*** to live ***x-******place*** ... then you reside in ***x-home,*** whether or not you rent or own.\n\nWhere they aware of the risks?\n\nI'm sure if they are asked:\n\n\\- \"... do you think that your manufactured/mobile home will get blown away in a hurricane...?\" \n\nTheir answer would be \"...yes, I understand the risk, however I like it here and can afford it...\".  \n\nIf they are asked: \n\n\"... will the landowner sell the plot of land underneath me, with less than thirty days notice, for no reason?\" \n\nTheir answer would probably be: \n\n\\- \"...No. I didn't understand that would be a risk. Who would, and what kind of person would do such a thing?\" \n\nSo, given all of the above, personally, I have a lot of sympathy for the people in Lake Park Estates.",

I remember just 10 years ago Aventura (on the west side of the train track) there was a major trailer park home. It\u2019s now replaced with condos. The best they can do is stall the eviction till they can find another home. Hopefully their lawyers is up for the challenge.",

Those who are defined by the \"FEW\" are getting outbid and outspent.",

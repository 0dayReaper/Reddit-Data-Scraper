Albertsons spent a considerable amount of money upgrading that location to a 24 Hour Safeway, complete with a Starbucks. That former Albertsons location also included the land beneath it, whereas the one across the street is leasing space in a shopping center.\n\nPublix acquired the former Albertsons but still has an active lease in the shopping center across the street. \n\nThe eventual plan is to modernize the former Albertsons in to a newer style Publix and close the one across the street with the lease is up.",

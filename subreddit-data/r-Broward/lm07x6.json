    "postText": "Hello\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am thinking of relocating from Charlotte, NC to Florida in 2022 and have narrowed down the list to either Tampa or somewhere outside of Miami. Main reason is everything in Charlotte is brand new, which is good and bad, but the bad part being a lack of an identity or any culture. It seems like every new restaurant that opens is a burger place, elevated bar food, or some sort of Southern inspired place. Also everything is very central to the city center of Charlotte, and once you are 20-30 minutes away (without traffic) there just isn't a lot to offer other than chains and generic vinyl village neighborhoods. There really aren't any neighborhoods with their own character/things to do. Just a few complaints.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have two main questions for those that live here, would you stay in/around the Miami area long term or entertain the thought of moving to Tampa? I am emphasizing the \"outside\" Miami portion because South Beach isn't necessarily our scene. But my girlfriend and I would like the convenience of having everything Miami has to offer within 30 minutes to an hours drive (depending on traffic) like shopping, good airport, professional sports teams, diverse restaurants, etc. I say all that because we have been to Miami before, but never to Tampa, so we have a little bit of experience with Miami and the immediate surrounding area. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now here is my generic \"what neighborhood should we target to live?\" question. Ideally we would rent for a year to learn the area before looking to buy a starter home, or maybe even a townhouse/condo. What neighborhoods should we target for renting? Any building/apartment recommendations? Specific areas to target for renting versus buying? We're open to anything as far north as Boca, as far south as Cutler Bay, and as far west as you can be before you hit the everglades. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContext: I'm 31, work at a hospital in healthcare administration (MHA), and we pay between $1,800-$1,900 a month in rent/utilities for a 1 bedroom in a nice area and building in Charlotte, NC. We like trying different types of restaurants, breweries and low-key bars over clubs, being active and outside. Not really trying to be around loud/younger/college-aged kids or immediate post-grads. Any thoughts on these things would be great, even better if anyone has relocated from either Charlotte or Raleigh to give that perspective. Bonus if anyone can comment on the job market/opportunity in the healthcare administration/management industry. Thanks in advance!",

Hollywood, Dania Beach, parts of Miramar, Davie and even Fort Lauderdale metro area have homes which were made in the 50's. There's architecture to appreciate, but the places where you could find such homes are not always the quietest nor are they always the most desirable for folks who visit thinking Florida equals Brickell downtown Miami and it's surrounding area. You can find places in Miami Springs too which have very old Florida building structures without being renovated and replaced by stucco box homes most often found in the wealthier suburbs.  \n\n\nAgain, though, if you make decent money and want to live somewhere which looks and feels clean, then you'll wind up in those cookie cutter homes out West. If you can handle some things which are a little less kept and don't mind a little strangeness then look closer places close to I-95. If you can get on the highway in five minutes, then there isn't really any place you want to go which isn't more than 25-35 minutes away. That goes for places on the I-595 as well.",

It is super cookie cutter, too planned, full of chain restaurants, no breweries, etc. The person who posted this was correct that it is a quiet area with good schools in the suburbs but it doesn't seem like what you are looking for. Unless you have kids and want that suburban lifestyle don't move there.\n\nI recommend Ft. Lauderdale, Wilton Manors, Pompano Beach, Oakland Park, Deerfield Beach, Boca. Anyplace east of I-95 is much better and more \"fun\" than west of I-95. On the west side is more suburban which is great for families. East still has great neighborhoods but is more youthful, beachy, and city-like while there can still be pockets of suburbia.\n\nAlso, I recommend in addition to East of I-95 to live Ft. Lauderdale or North of Ft. Lauderdale. South of Ft. Lauderdale in Broward is all very similar to Pembroke Pines in what I described. I'm biased because I really do not like Miami mainly because I hate driving there. I think Ft. Lauderdale and it's slightly North suburbs are a great area to be in with lots of fun things to do for your age range. It is easier to drive around there and easier to get to things in West Palm Beach from Ft. Lauderdale (Delray/Boca area is pretty fun to hang around in). Also, if you live in Ft. Lauderdale area it is still only 30min-1hr drive to Miami.\n\nEdit: Hollywood (even though it is South of Ft. Lauderdale) is also a good choice for you.",

Wynwood is up and coming and is hit or miss when it comes to safety. On miami beach, check out Sofi (South of Fifth) neighborhood. Less touristy, the beach and a big park. Other areas include Mimo district and Aventura. If you have more questions, I am happy to help!",

It has everything you need like restaurants, bar, beaches, a damn good airport and nice neighborhoods.\nTo live in a good and safe neighborhood in miami it will be very expensive. \nI don\u2019t have an opinion about tampa since I\u2019ve been there only once",

            "comment": "I\u2019m adding the the poster that said you basically have two choices when it comes to south Florida.... you can live in a \u201csafer\u201d suburb a good 30/45 mins from downtown and be surrounded by strip malls or you can live near downtown and put up with the constant crime. Basically the further East you go you will have more crackheads/hookers/robberies and car thieves. Even in west broward we have our share of gun shots and auto thefts until you start to get close to the Everglades. I can\u2019t speak for Tampa but I\u2019d recommend speaking to some locals there obvs. South Florida is great if you enjoy going to the beach and eating out at restaurants but as far as culture and things to do? It\u2019s usually too hot most of the year to do much else outdoors, and our culture is predominantly Hispanic and Caribbean so would work well for you if you are from either of those backgrounds. Covid has boarded up most of the local indoor activities which to be honest are mostly stores anyway. Source: lived here for about 30 years.",

Lauderdale, both East of 95 by the beach, for *years,* and I've never been the vicitm of a crime worse than someone stealing my sunglasses out of my unlocked car parked on the street.\n\nPeople who live in the burbs really be wanting to paint the cities here as some wild west. It's absurd.",

When I had a dog I had routine offers to buy my dog for fighting, but that stopped when he died a few years ago. Animal control was called often in our old neighborhood for pitbull fighting and loose pits. We also had a few homocides in my childhood neighborhood, one of a teenage daughter of my neighbor stabbed to death in her bed that went entirely unsolved. My parents eventually moved out of there because gunfire rang out frequently at night. One of our neighbors got his head beat in with a cricket bat during a domestic dispute with another neighbor. This wasn\u2019t downtown, this was just the edge of north Lauderdale. I\u2019m poor as shit though and always live in rentals on the outskirts of west broward because we can\u2019t afford a mortgage or a house so your mileage may vary. I think it\u2019s easy to think west broward doesn\u2019t have any crime if you have the privilege to never experience or see it. It was also a common sight to see people beating their kids in my local Walmart, oh lord now I\u2019m getting flashbacks. I remember seeing the police log of my old neighborhood on the edge of north Lauderdale and they were called in over 400 times in one year. I mean I realize most of this stuff isn\u2019t life or death but it sucks worrying about your car getting stolen, or being harassed walking down the street, or worrying about your parents catching a stray bullet or watching people beat the shit out of each other in the parking lot. It gets tiresome dude and I\u2019m just being honest about what I\u2019ve seen since we first moved down here in 1989.",

And I wouldn't call the area surrounding downtown/las olas/the beaches bad, nor could you live there if you are poor as shit, because it is expensive real estate. So I'm not sure why you're painting a picture of downtown being \"bad\" when it's not. I lived in Poinsettia Heights. None of this shit happened there. And it was on the edge of Fort Lauderdale, next to Oakland Park. \n\nIdk if you're talking about different time periods, but none of what you're saying comports with the way fort lauderdale is and has been since at least i've [and my extended family have] lived there, which was since 2012.",

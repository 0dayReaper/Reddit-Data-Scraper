In the event the parents are so backwards that they refuse to allow her to get an abortion, the judge can allow her the opportunity. Yes it\u2019s at the judges discretion but based on the facts of her situation, it\u2019s highly unlikely she will be denied. She needs to just prove that she is mature enough to make the decision on her own. \n\nNeither of us know the exact time of how long the proceedings take so it\u2019s just speculation. I\u2019d imagine that it wouldn\u2019t be something they would drag out (like other court proceedings) as they are limited to 15w for the decision to be made.",

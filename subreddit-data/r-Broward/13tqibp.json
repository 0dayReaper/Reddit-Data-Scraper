    "postText": "Premo Broward just released their preliminary plans for upgrading public transportation in Broward. While any improvement is good, I find the proposal...underwhelming. There is barely any rail planned and most changes are just making bus frequency higher on certain roads, it seems to me. Also, West Pines, West Miramar, Weston, Davie, Cooper City, and Parkland are basically ignored. I know these are more affluent areas, but the whole attitude that public transportation is for the less fortunate, rather than being a public good for general use is so ridiculous. Place with high functioning transit systems have transit that is used broadly by ALL classes of people.",

Planners come up with inflated ridership numbers to sell the light rail, but by the time it actually gets built those numbers turn out to have been a total fantasy.  Then it\u2019s an enormously large sunk cost, so the party line becomes that people will eventually learn to love the light rail route, which never happens.  Unsupported by fares, it sucks in more and more tax money in operating costs (on top of the huge construction costs), until finally some investigative reporter writes a story about the sad history of the project and everybody finally admits that it\u2019s a huge failure which should never have been built\u2026. \n   \n**[$200 Million Ride To Nowhere](https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=130201&amp;page=1)**\n   \nTri Rail isn't light rail.  It's \"commuter rail\", which runs on existing (\"regular\", or if you prefer, \"heavy\") railroad tracks.  The only investment needed is purchasing the vehicles, which are fungible - they can be sold in case South Florida commuters don't like riding it.   \n   \nLight rail is completely different.  Instead of reusing existing tracks, light rail ***requires the construction of new tracks***.  In fact, the vast majority of the funding goes into building the light rail tracks.  And those tracks are not at all fungible.  They are permanently locked into the place they were built.  If passengers reject the light rail, there's no way to sell these extremely expensive tracks on to somebody else in another state (as one can easily do with commuter rail cars).  It is a permanently sunk cost and there is zero room for error.  \n   \nContrast that with electric busses.  Electric busses are highly fungible and in heavy demand.  Unlike regular (aka heavy) rail cars which can only be sold to users of standard North American rails, electric busses can be sold at any moment to any user throughout the world.   And electric busses can instantly be redirected to more productive routes as needed.  \n   \nIn summary,  \n   \n* Commuter Rail Exit Strategy: Sell the rail cars.  Done!    \n   \n* Electric Bus Exit Strategy: Sell the electric busses.  Done!     \n   \n* Light Rail Exit Strategy:  Declare bankruptcy, lose billions.   \n   \nAre you beginning to understand why light rail reeks?",

Unlike light rail, a bus isn't locked into a fixed route and can be redirected to different routes - it can very easily respond effectively to actual passenger demand.

Bus costs go instead to the passenger-facing transport vehicles.  \n   \nFor any given amount of money, the electric bus is vastly more cost-effective than light rail.

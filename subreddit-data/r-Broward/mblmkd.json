Also, key things to consider when buying a property, age of roof, plumbing (pvc or copper preferred), electrical (electrical box type matters too) and AC. Those become important for properties older than the 1990s. Carriers require full updates from roughly 1990s or older. Well... nowadays 1995 or older I should say. Also, there is a difference between a partial and full replacement. Re-doing a roof isn\u2019t the same as fully replacing it. Hope this is informative.",

            "comment": "I work in Wholesale Insurance, which deals with a large market share of insurance in Florida. Also known as Excess &amp; Surplus insurance. The reason the rates have gone up is a multitude of factors. There are two sides of the market, admitted and non-admitted companies or in layman\u2019s terms, private carriers and state-backed carriers. Private carriers stay in the market voluntarily, having many private carriers provides options (supply) which when it keeps up with demand, decreases rates. Most private markets have pulled out of Florida because of what is called social inflation. This is largely in reference to the public adjusters and lawyers that are blowing claims out of proportion, so let\u2019s say the cost of a roof replacement was $15k, what is now happening is the lawyers will play the system to increase the cost to $30k. When this happens they take a profit, pay the contractor but ultimately the consumer or insured pays the price. Why? Because private carriers won\u2019t touch you because you are now a risk of another potential claim that could blow up out of proportion. So instead of dealing with a lot of the fraud in Florida, they are simply saying, I won\u2019t insure anyone, pulling from the market. Which in turn, decreases options (supply) and with demand remaining the same or now increasing (new Yorkers and cali people) rates sky rocket to compensate for the increase of exposure to the carriers who remain.",

Which those costs as we all know are astronomically high, for what they offer. In the end, the costs are passed to the carriers which then instead of looking at a $30k roof replacement, they are also looking at another $50 to $100k cost of lawyer fees on your end and theirs. Poof, bye bye reasonably priced insurance rates.\n\nAlso, right now because of the lack of carriers, retailers are being forced to place a ton of homeowners into Citizens, a state-backed insurance company. In the view of risk management, given they are Almost the only current market, the increase of exposure can blow them up and ruin the insurance market in Florida. Which is why wholesalers and retailers are doing their best to create programs that involve insurtech to minimize risk, track exposures and adding exclusions that could limit the costs of battling a lawyer who is simply trying to blow up the cost to make money. We all know those adjusters who go door knocking and tell you they can make you money off a scratch on your door (insert dramatic tone)",

They're attributing the high price to high risk and insurance fraud every season. If you file a claim they always fight it, unless you hire a lawyer, then they flag you and raise your premium the following year if they process your claim. And if you try to switch insurance, the new insurance checks first if you have prior claims to see if they even want to take you as a new customer or not. They can also take you on but with ridiculous insurance premiums. Please inform yourself before commenting.",

But given the amount of catastrophes in the last 3 years, wildfires, hurricanes, social inflation, Covid, etc. these took a massive toll so now retailers (insurance agents) are re-marketing every single account they have to try and find a market with a competitive rate. Nearly 73% on average of a premium paid goes to reserves for future claims, roughly 25% goes to administrative and commission expenses and 2% is kept as profit from underwriting. Where insurance companies compensate from the low underwriting profit, is from investing the money they maintain in their float. Which if that year they could potentially be at an underwriting loss, they will depend more heavily on investment income. But even then that is not some times enough and their combined ratio still comes out higher at 102 to 105",

As for hurricanes, whoa, we are not on the same page there. Dorian, Michael, Irma, Matthew. But I remind you, as I mentioned in above comments, a large part stems from catastrophes across the nation, social inflation and also reinsurance rates. A carrier let\u2019s say ICAT, doesn\u2019t only insure Floridians, they spread their risk across other states in the country. Which btw, they pulled out of the market it a couple years ago. So if they take large hits in other areas, that decreases their ability to continue to be so liberal on pricing in other areas. You have to compensate in some for the others. The question they ask themselves is, is it worth to continue to offer coverage in Florida if we have other states that are less risky and cause smaller losses? Once again, they can voluntarily choose this as they are a private carrier",

A good source to cross-reference is checking their credit rating on AM Best, those companies have the financial backing to survive catastrophes. If you are an Insured, that is willing to be cheap on insurance, choosing a Demotech rated insurance company, then you get what you paid for. Companies that have weak financial backings, get destroyed in catastrophe season and are forced to go bankrupt. Which is why in Florida it is REQUIRED your agent attempts to place you in the Admitted (state-backed) market first. If your risk (home) has issues or is in a geographic region that the state-backed companies don\u2019t prefer. Then you are forced into the non-admitted. Conclusion: Try and be placed in Admitted markets, if you can\u2019t, try and verify the company backing your policy is AM Best rated A- or better. That should save you the hassle for the future",

I can only speak to my experience, and Dr. Oddman is lovely and smart.",

I've had 3 appointments just not get booked at all despite calling them in, and having to pick an \"available timeslots\".   Twice now I've also had bills go to collections despite paying my co-pays at time of service and never receiving a bill.  Just trying to save someone else the headache.",

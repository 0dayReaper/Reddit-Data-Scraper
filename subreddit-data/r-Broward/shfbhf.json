    "postText": "My parents lived in Hallendale, Florida in the late 1950s across from the old Gulfstream Park. I believe the motel was called Breezeway Inn and it was on Rt 1. They lived there from 1957 to 1960. I believe the woman (my grandmother) that owned the motel was Blanch St Louis or Blanch Landry. I have tried to find pictures of the motel but have been unsuccessful. The pictures of mom and dad don't have a good glimpse of the motel.  My mom is starting to progress a little faster with dementia and was hoping to find a few pictures to (hopefully) help her remember her time in Florida. Any ideas?",

    "postText": "Great idea to make a city street look like it was taken out of a children\u2019s museum, wrong street to do it on. \n\nThe folks over in Deerfield Beach decided it would be a good idea to take a lane away in either direction on  NE 3rd Ave between Sample Rd and 48th St so they could put in a bike/walking. They decided to take it a step further than the typical run of the mill path though. They needed their path to have an ocean and fish painted on the road. Can\u2019t forget to add in some white poles every 3 feet for protection for the pedestrians walking the new path either. They gave this new path a whole lane, the right southbound lane and made the center lane a turning lane. Added some nifty white poles on the opposite the new path you know for aesthetics.  It looks great. Keyword here being looks. It\u2019s functionality is severely lacking. \nThat new path they created for bikes and pedestrians, pointless. Most people are walking on the opposite side of the street using the sidewalks. That center lane isn\u2019t really a turning lane. Nope, it\u2019s a personal highway for motorists. Cars are going 15 mph because it\u2019s 7:45am &amp; a school zone. Just zip around them in the center lane. That\u2019s why it\u2019s there. Someone is backing out of their driveway into the center lane &amp; here comes Mr. Important flying up that same lane honking his horn &amp; flashing his lights because you have no business backing into his lane. How dare you!  Too many people waiting at the stop sign, you guess it. Use that center lane and cut everyone else that\u2019s been waiting 3 minutes already for their turn. \nIt\u2019s like city planners forgot they made that section of the road a four lane street for a reason. \nMake Tedder Better is a great idea. This little pet project is not the answer. Put it back the way it was. I promise Tedder residents will thank you for it.",

I haven't had time to test out the improvements myself as I'm a bit farther west. I do find it hard to imagine how traffic calming and intersection improvements could make it worse for pedestrians and people on bikes. I will try to make it out there to see though.",

They did paint a couple of arrows in the turning lane this weekend but I literally for a stretch of a couple blocks.  Once again last night my family was almost struck while attempting to pull into our driveway.  A car was flying up the turning lane towards us and then quickly cut of a car to avoid hitting us.  There was a second car following close behind and he had to swerve into the opposite lane.  \n\nI really hope they go back to the old way once these 6 months are up.  No one is using the newly painted roads for walking or biking.",

    "postText": "Hi bros and sis.. just to lyk that BROWARD COLLEGE, Building #60 in Coconut Creek (Norht Campus) has Covid Vaccines AVAILABLE (no charge). Very quick lines and process. Go early for availability cus i believe i heard there are 500 vaccines per day. Any ways its from 8:30 am to 4:15 pm. They had Moderna vaccines. Just take ur ID and a phone (cus u need to fill a form in the website) and, of course, being FL resident. Good luck to everyone!",

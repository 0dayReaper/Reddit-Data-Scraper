    "postText": "I am a born and bred New Englander who just accepted a job in Boca Raton! My partner and I are excited to move down and have been looking at 2 BR apartment with a budget between $1,600-$1,850 a month. I know Boca is not in Broward County, but we love Broward because it's between Boca and Fort Lauderdale. We like the outdoors (parks, trails, etc.) and would love to live in a place with some fun bars/cultural events. In terms of wants and needs, we\u2019re young and are happy as long as there are things to do and the area is relatively safe. The beach is not a must, so we\u2019ve been looking mostly west of I-95. Apartments seem to be cheaper there anyways, but I may be wrong. Due to the pandemic, we have not been able to travel down to scope out any neighborhoods, but after doing some research we're focusing on places like Coral Springs and Coconut Creek. Any recommendations for other cities/neighborhoods that may not come up in your average Google search for best places to live in Broward? Or recommendations on dealing with Broward landlords? Thank you very much!",

There is nice places in Coral Springs as far as staying inside and esthetically but as a whole, I wouldnt move there anymore. West Coconut creek is nice but youre bordering Pompano's seediest parts.....\n\nIm a native floridian. Ive lived pretty much everywhere from south Miami to West palm beach.\n\nI moved to Boca back in 2015 and I absolutely love it!. You're budget is spot on for what 1/2 bedroom apartments go far. I highly suggest looking at places like Tuscany Pointe, Boca Arbor club, Somerset place or Reflections. I live in one of those and we love it!. There is a golf course that laps around all of these complexes and you see all day and early evening people walking their dog, walking and biking with kids. Its aver 30s and 40s crowd with a sprinkle of FAU college kids. A lot of families here. Its super quiet at night. The beach is only a 7 minute drive as well and downtown Boca with all the ritzy shops is also about 5 miles from the area.\n\nSo, within a 2 mile radius we have:\n\nTarget\n\nCVS/ Walgreens, Walmart\n\nPublix ( Like Hannafords but nicer)\n\nMcdonalds,BK, Taco Bell, Firehouse subs Pei Wei and all the restaurants in the mall.\n\nBoca Town Center mall \n\nAAAAAND a lot of available doctors 2 miles away as well as an Animal hospital (If you have pets).\n\nThere is a ton of things nearby but the way Boca is laid out it doesnt look all commercial and busy. Everything is kind of spread out nicely and of course Boca Raton makes everything look nice. Broward has really gone downhill as far as crime and price inflation. You can live in nice Boca with the same amount of money youd spend in a decent area in Broward.\n\nIf for whatever reason you decide Broward,  keep west (Unless youre ON the beach). Commute would be at least 45 mins/30 mins. Look at Weston,  west Tamarac,  west Sunrise, Pembroke Pines ( Longer commute)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoca traffic sucks during snowbird season but other than that its great. I never leave my little area only to go to work. Everything is right near us!. Let me know if you have any questions , Id be happy to help!",

I scheduled an appointment with a realtor on Saturday all day so it\u2019s really going to be a apartment-searching frenzy. Best of luck to you and hopefully you can get a long weekend off to check it out!",

My advice is to find a realtor if you can, to visit the apartments even if just for a weekend, and to get started early due to the insanely long HOA approval process down in FL. Thank you again to everyone for your help and support.",

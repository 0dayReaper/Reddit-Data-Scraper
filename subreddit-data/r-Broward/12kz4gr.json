    "postText": "Hey guys I am looking to get a window resized. Currently the window is huge and takes up a wall in my kitchen. I\u2019d liked to get it resized to be a bit smaller. I\u2019ve called around and everyone that has answered makes it seem like strange request but this window is a liability honestly. Does any one know of any companies or contractors that would be able to resize a window? Thanks for the help!",

For a house we recently fixed up, we made one opening larger and another opening smaller to match the same size as another window.\n\nTo make a smaller window, they\u2019ll just build up the opening with concrete block to fit the new window size. Sorry I dont have anyone to recommend though.",

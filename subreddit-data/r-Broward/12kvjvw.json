Hopefully you guys get in trouble for this. \n\nShort story. \nApartment complex parking lot was getting flooded and people moved their cars to a empty parking lot to protect their cars. The space is always empty. \n\nGuess what? A tow truck company started  taking cars away starting at 5AM. And only cars that they know it was from working people. There was some abandoned one, they didn't touch those. \n\n This company are greedy and taking advantage of this.",

I love an honest tow driver. Doing the lords work. But these car kidnappers that would mess with folks during a natural disaster like last night??? That\u2019s cold.",

Real assholes. They\u2019ll hide signs, be ready with the tow truck if you\u2019re one minute late, they play a pretty nasty game",

    "postText": "Hello! I am getting my vaccine this Saturday at the Pompano Citi Centre location. When I called to register I was told it\u2019s walk-in appts and I can get there any time from 8am-4pm. I will have my four month old with me and do not want to get stuck in a super long line with her if avoidable. Does anyone have any experience with this site? Best time to get there etc. \n\nThank you!\n\nETA: it\u2019s a drive through site, which I did not realize initially \ud83d\ude02. I got there at 10:10 am and had the shot by 10:28. The whole thing was quick, painless and very efficient!!",

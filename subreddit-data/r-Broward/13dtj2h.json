    "postText": "Hi Good People of Broward.   My colleague is looking to retire in Broward and purchase a property next year.   He likes the subdivision of West Lake Village in Hollywood.    He has a good amount to spend on a property (around $1m).   However, we are a little bit concerned about issues with insurance and the property market generally.  Of course, no one can forecast what the property market will do - depends on many factors.   As for insurance, I wondered if anyone knows or can link me to any resources for things like whether his insurance will be affected by certain issues, notably whether it is worthwhile getting a Broward Flood Plain Map because I have heard that where your property sits on this map influences how much your insurance will cost.   I have also heard that it is hard to get insurance in coastal areas (he will not be right on the coast) and that it probably has to be obtained through Citizens Insurance?   Any other information or things he should be thinking about in buying in Florida are gratefully received.   Many thanks!",

The state has very lax regulations, so owner occupied homes are mixed in with quite a few short term rentals that can be problematic at times.  The neighborhood floods, and some streets flood pretty bad. The city is working on a fix, but so far nothing has worked. https://www.hollywoodfl.org/824/Flood-Zone-Map   Insurance is only (with a few exceptions) available thru the state run Citizens insurance.  He will also have to get wind and flood. I haven't seen the new flood rates, and I'm very afraid.  It's not that he won't be able to get insurance, it's that it will be expensive.  I'd suggest forming a relationship with a good insurance agent now so you can get meaningful quotes for potential properties (ask sellers to provide him the elevation certificate from the current owner).  I've lived in the area for years and I love it. I'm willing to put up with the flooding and hurricane risk (evacuation zone) but the cost of the insurance is making me think of moving. \nAs far as Hollywood in general- the current city government is dead set on over development  (new skyscrapers on what used to be a low rise beach) and the traffic is horrible. It's brutally hot in the summer, but Dec- April are gorgeous.",

You will still need flood insurance but the homes are beautiful and the creek that runs through the golf course should  be the farthest point you want to be near water.\n\nEven though some areas of Hollywood are above ground (where downtown floods on rainy days) you will certainly want flood insurance anyways.",

Hollywood is massive and just like Davie or Plantation or Sunrise, has good areas and bad areas. What areas out West dont have is good food and entertainment. \n\nI have lived all over Broward, there isnt much dramatically different between Cooper City, Plantation, Davie, Sunrise, Pembroke Pines, Hollywood etc. Its always about what youre looking for. Personally, i prefer being near the beach, having great food options, and being central to Miami and Fort Lauderdale, so Hollywood or Hallandale or Dania is perfect. It all depends on preferences.",

Everyone has different lifestyle choices, and you arent getting anything special in Victoria Park or Lighthouse point or Bayview for a million or less.   \n\n\nAlso, you clearly don't spend much time in Hollywood if you think Hollywood has more 'opioid zombies' than areas around downtown Ft Lauderdale like Victoria Park. No doubt downtown Hollywood and areas along US1 for sure had plenty of drugs and hookers for a long ass time, but Hollywood has changed dramatically through the years and that stuff is far from prevalent. \n\nBut again, dont think youre really in touch with the real estate market or with Hollywood to act like all those places are somehow far far better.",

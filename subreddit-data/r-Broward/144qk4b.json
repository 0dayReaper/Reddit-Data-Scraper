    "postText": "Ok - so these realtors aren\u2019t really helping me because legally they are not allowed to tell me anything about school districts and what they\u2019re like. I have already contacted the school district and while they have told me what is offered for special-needs children, they can\u2019t provide me with personal insight and experiences.\n\nThat being said, if anyone has a disabled/special-needs child who requires special education (not just being pulled out but an actual special-Ed classroom with an aide and children with autism and intellectual disability) can you please share with me what MIDDLE SCHOOLS offer the best programs? If you would like for me to PM you for privacy, I can do that. No problem! I really appreciate the help. Thank you for helping my boy \ud83d\ude0a",

The big issue we just ran into is that they're mainstreaming most of the 5th graders to go to regular middle school when they're not even close to being ready. My son is at a 2nd grade math level and 3rd for English. We're looking at some private schools but it's going to cost us 8k a year after scholarships.",

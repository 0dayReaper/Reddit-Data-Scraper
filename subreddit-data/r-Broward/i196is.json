    "postText": "We all can't forget the MSD shooting and the officer on duty's cowardice. I have voted for Israel in the past and thought he was pretty decent. I have a love hate/relationship with Police and especially this year, I have really woken up to how horrible this instutition has become. However we still need these public servants and this Sheriff election will have a winner so why not vote?\n\nIsrael is endorsed [here](https://outline.com/H4Cjb7). They make some compelling arguments but can I forgive him with MSD? Tony seems like a plant from DeSantis who I do not trust. Tony is rife with drama already as well. Another very divisive figure. \n\nI like Al Pollock. He seems committed, decorated and many years on the force. But am I just throwing my vote away?\n\nWho would you pick?",

He came across so self serving and more like a slimy politician than a police officer. I want somebody who will protect our county and hold deputies accountable for misconduct. I feel like Tony is accomplishing that (which is probably why the police union hates him so badly), but I will certainly concede that the sample size is very, very small. FWIW, I know many people supporting Al Pollock. I haven't decided who to vote for yet, but it will probably be Tony or Pollock. I just don't know enough yet to make an informed decision.",

It was a national embarrassment for us in Parkland in so many ways, with Israel's behavior being just one of them. His damage control was disgusting and plain unconvincing. He is yet another negligent (failure to train for active shooters, failure to react to calls about shooter) Broward County official who is way more worried about their PR and private deals than actually doing a good job.\n\nAlso worth noting his defense of Scot Peterson (SRO who didn't confront shooter). Scott Israel's son barely got a slap on the wrist when he was involved in the anal rape with a baseball bat of a 14-year-old. Why was his punishment so lenient? None other than [Scot Peterson](https://www.local10.com/news/2018/05/25/parents-call-for-investigation-into-stoneman-douglas-assault-involving-sheriffs-son/). I believe Israel cut a private deal with the victim's parents for expedited or cheap permits for their restaurant to keep them quiet. This is just one case of Israel's misconduct. It's likely that there are many more.",

He made some awful appearances and speeches following the shooting, mostly consisting of the worst damage control I have ever seen as well as basically taunting Parkland residents by parading himself around the city, acting high and mighty, showing no inkling of fault, guilt, or remorse while knowing that everyone here resented him for his failures.\n\nIn Parkland, most people see him as the Sheriff whose office received 18 calls warning of the shooter's behavior without any action being taken. Most also see him as the Sheriff who failed to train his deputies for this situation. While I don't see him as the *most* at fault for prevention failure (FBI, school admin, etc.. but that's a different discussion), his actions that I mentioned above were certainly questionable enough for me (and most Parklanders) to completely withdraw our support for him.",

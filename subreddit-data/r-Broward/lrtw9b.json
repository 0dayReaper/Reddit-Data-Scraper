    "postText": "My little brother is starting school soon and we\u2019re trying to figure out which to register him for. Two languages are spoken so he\u2019s struggling a little with this. However he\u2019s progressing slowly. I wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s at a almost 4 year old speech and understanding level but he\u2019s trying. My question is what is the difference between VPK and Head Start? I want to make sure I apply for what\u2019s best for him. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Ok so Head Start is more supportive to low income families where the child needs social and cognitive support and VPK is more focused on academics. I believe head start may be a better option however you can tour some preschools and bring your concerns up and explore what their program offers.",

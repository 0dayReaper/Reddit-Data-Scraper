And seriously good beer at Black Flamingo - I am in love with their Maple French Toast brew - it's like drinking dessert!  \n\nAnd I'm not affiliated with Black Flamingo either - I'm in the band High Dose.  We're pretty decent hardcore/punk with a fierce girl singer!: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/HighDoseband",

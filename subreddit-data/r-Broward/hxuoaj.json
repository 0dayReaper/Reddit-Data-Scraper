    "postText": "Hi everyone.\n\nA cat in our neighborhood had 5 kittens, this senior lady who recently lost her husband took them in to save them from being killed even though she's on a limited budget.\n\nWhen we went over to see how she was doing during CoVid, we saw this \"cat enclosure\" she paid someone $350 for. Eyesore and horrible couldn't even begin to describe it.\n\nSo we've seen a lot of helpful people posting on here and was wondering if anyone has a good handyman they can recommend who would be able to give her a good deal on that and I think a minor patio wood repair thing.\n\nWe mentioned to her and she said she was fine with us asking so if you know anyone, please direct message me with their contact details?\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this",

I measured roughly what she was talking about and it's about a 6x6 or 7x6 structure, just 2x4s and using her present mesh \"walls\".\n\nReally kind and helpful of you to send that link.",

The only really bad part is 56 Ave. The area where Paul Turner, Castle Hill Elementary, Florida Medical Center and surrounding are pretty good.\n\nLauderhill mall area isn't bad either tbh. It's just the mall that make people think it's bad, and even that mall has cleaned up a lot.\n\nGo for it OP!. Lauderhill and Lauderdale Lakes has a lot of people from the Caribbean so its a different flavor of life for sure! People go out for walks and talk to their neighbors and have lots of community events at the parks. You're not going to find multi millionaires, high rises or a yacht club there but it's definitely far from a bad area.",

Paul turner area is pretty good, as well as the area near castle hill but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the best place to look for a studio apartment or 1 bedroom. I just feel like there are way better places. To the OP I think if you want better suggestion, maybe tell us your budget on what you want for rent. It would better help us make better and more suitable suggestions.",

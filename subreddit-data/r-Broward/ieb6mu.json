    "postText": "The 2020 election will be one of the most important in history. Make sure you are registered to vote, and that your vote is counted! In Florida, you must register by October 5th. You can register at https://registertovoteflorida.gov/\n\nEarly in-person voting for Florida varies by county, but starts as early as October 19th, and ends as late as November 1st.  All counties must provide at least one week of early voting.  You can find your location at your [Supervisor of Elections' website](https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/supervisors/), or at [this link](https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/for-voters/voting/early-voting/) (not yet up to date for the November election).\n\nYou can also request a mail-in ballot from your County Supervisor of Elections: https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/supervisors/. Do so as soon as possible to make sure it arrives and is sent back on time. Your ballot must be received by Election Day, November 3rd. Send it back as soon as possible, or drop it off in person at a drop box.  You can find drop boxes at your early in-person voting location (see above).  There may be other locations in your county where you can drop off a mail ballot in person - check your [Supervisor of Elections](https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/supervisors/) website for more information.\n\nIf you mail your ballot, you can track it [here](https://registration.elections.myflorida.com/CheckVoterStatus).\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!",

It would need to be something like interlocking concrete barriers to actually provide some protection from a moving vehicle.\n\nThe lines and poles are just psychological nudges for drivers to follow the accepted rules.\n\nThe poles are used in places specifically where a driver needs a stronger \"nudge\" to follow the rules: places where traffic accumulates, where you can cut corners, or HOV lanes.  i.e. your car is going to get dented if you break the rules here.\n\nIn most places, drivers do not need this stronger nudge to not drive in a bike lane.",

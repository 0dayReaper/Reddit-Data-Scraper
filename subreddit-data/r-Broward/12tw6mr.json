There have been so many people swerving between lanes, driving extra slow, that I tried to see if it was a social media challenge.",

But it\u2019s not necessarily the drivers that are getting worse, it\u2019s that our population is growing and our infrastructure enables dangerous driving. \n\nFor example, our stroad lanes have basically the same width as the highways, encouraging speeding, there\u2019s nothing to slow people down except traffic. \n\nI believe Broward is literally known for having the most dangerous roads in the nation.",

Moved back to SoFlo from up north (mostly Chicago), after 20+ yrs. and due to being again a daily-driver, I've noticed how much worse driving has been since pre-Covid.  ...Also, to your point, maybe even a notable \"dip\" in recent weeks, possibly due to tourist (?) activity.  Anyway, it was always bad down here, but much worse since 2020-era.\n\n(2.)  Just a big Heads-Up out there:  From the Turnpike to the clubhouse in our community, the cops, troopers, and other enforcement seems like more-and-more prominent recently as well.  ...We may all wish to have back our friends making illegal U-turns, going straight from turn lanes, and roving groups of teenagers on dirtbikes.  ...My gut-feeling is that there is a \"heavy hand\" going to be applied.  Either way, we have to be on the lookout, IMHO.",

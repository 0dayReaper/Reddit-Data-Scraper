You actually get to meet with your friends, hang out, and actually learn stuff unlike online school, everyone if not almost everyone cheated at least once whilst doing online school. If you like online school that much you should just do FLVS, Florida Virtual School.",

By the time you\u2019re an adult you will probably learn that lesson in order to succeed in the real world, but you\u2019ll look back and wish you had learned it while you\u2019re still in middle school. You can still avoid that regret!",

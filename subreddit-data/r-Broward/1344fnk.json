    "postText": "The VIP DB Cinemas in Broward County offers open captions (on-screen subtitles) periodically. The screenings are arranged by a deaf organization, but are open to everyone and the screenings are posted on the theater website. The theater posts the screenings roughly a week prior to the show date. Upcoming open captioned screenings:\n\n**Tuesday, May 9, 7:00 pm**\n\n*Guardians of the Galaxy*\n\n**Tuesday, May 23, 7:00 pm**\n\n*Fast X*\n\nOpen captions are not just for people with hearing loss. They can also benefit some people with autism, attention deficit disorder, auditory processing disorder, kids learning to read, adults learning English as a second language, noise sensitive, and many young adults just prefer captions.\n\nWant to know more about open captions?

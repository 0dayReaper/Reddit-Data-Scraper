Pretty sure it goes from university all the way to flamingo.",

I usually go to Mullins Park just because it's near my house but it's not the best trail, lots of patchy areas. Betti Stradling Park is okay. Not in Broward but I really like Spanish River Athletic Park in Boca (I work near there and go after work sometimes).",

Crazy.\n\nEven this article- that's literally about *the ocean fucking rising and swamping neighborhoods*- doesn't use the phrase \"climate change\" once and tries to blame the canals somehow. \n\nAnd why don't you think we're getting funding for pumps or levees or whatever? Because nobody wants to throw good money after bad. Florida is doomed. Our slow decent into the sea has begun and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it. \n\nHope yall weren't dumb enough to buy land here lol.",

(not depending on gravity to drain streets).\n\nWhat is surprising is real estate insurance has not reflected the risks IMO.  who is making loans on soon to be underwater real estate....  seems crazy to me.",

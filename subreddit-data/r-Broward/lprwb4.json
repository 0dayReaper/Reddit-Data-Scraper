I know Hollywood has rough patches so is there anyone in the area that can share their experience? \n\nFor context:\nI\u2019m a young professional who is going to be commuting to north Miami. I\u2019m looking for quiet, affordable and to be surrounded by other young professionals - nightlife or beach isn\u2019t important to me. Trying to keep my budget under $1,500 and commute around 30 minutes.",

But van buren is also right next to the boulevard so there's a lot of nightlife, and tourists. It's not the greatest mix. Lot of shady people looking for a quick buck with a lot of easy targets walking around.  In the height of tourist season two of my coworkers got held up in this area at gun point in the same month. The east side of US1 is a little bit nicer but will cost more.",

Hollywood has a free transportation system called the circuit (there's an app for that) which you can request like an Uber. It makes it great for going to the beach, especially if you're going to be drinking.",

This doesn't take into account insurance or whether an ambulance would even ask which hospital to take you to. There's a good chance you won't be coherent enough in an ambulance to weigh all this out as well.\n\nHealthcare options should start with doctor's offices for regular care not hospitals for emergency care. I think it's good to have more hospitals but to say it will help the average patient have more healthcare options is a big stretch.",

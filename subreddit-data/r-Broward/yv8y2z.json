Those with advanced degrees have the most mobility of job selection, and so they are moving out in larger percentages.\n\n2) Blue voters hate Crist. Notice that ALL of Crist's numbers are **significantly** lower than Gillum's except amongst those with BA. The BA number is still lower, but not significantly.\n\nI mean, everyone knew Crist was going to tank. Every single Blue that I spoke to when he was governor was severely disappointed on his performance. He went back on a ton of campaign promises, and just abandoned most of the rest. Utterly useless as a Democratic leader. It was an idiotic move by Democratic leadership to run him, again. Just another in a long series of idiotic moves by Democratic leadership.",

Because i understand that, I see these policies as part of a COVID response pattern and not as an authoritarian threat. They shut down gyms and cancelled concerts, and I am not an idiot so I understand why.\n\nBut when i read about Florida having its own state guard, and an election police force, and when i see the governor fire almost an entire school board and replace them with people loyal to him, when I see the governor get his electoral map implemented even though it isn't really supposed to be up to him, when i see him make a strong effort to intimidate higher education, when i see them trying to pass laws to give one single person even more direct control over things traditionally outside his jurisdiction even in Florida which is already a very authoritarian state (as are the southern states which were built up intentionally to control and repress) compared to states in other regions... etc etc. I mean, concentrating power is what I define as authoritarian.\n\nPassing policies you don't like may feel authoritarian to you but it is not the same as a politician concentrating more power and exercising more control than their office typically would intend.",

It included policy that had never been necessary before, it was a massive concentration of power to the executive branch. Supporters claimed it was necessary to meet national interests but there was no evidence or precedent that this was true. The invasion of privacy of Americans, the interviews conducted using torture (again, with no evidence that it is effective), the increase in power to law enforcement... This was predicted by it's opponents and known at the time, yet we went with the unproven, threatening and undemocratic action anyway.\n\nThings like mask mandates were done by LOCAL governments, using existing policy and existing powers. Mask mandates did not make any politicians rich or five them more power. They did not violate anyone's privacy, put anyone at risk of being exploited, or otherwise oppress anyone. They were not spontaneously created with no precedent or evidence of efficacy. They were implemented 100 years ago for influenza, they reflect knowledge and best practices in medicine and public health, and they were supported by a consensus of experts in those things. The reasoning for them is easy to understand, the science behind it is easy to understand, so it's even possible for a layperson to understand how harm reduction works through these policies.\n\nI think it's more authoritarian for a governor to PREVENT a local jurisdiction from regulating itself according to its own needs when it comes to something like a mask mandate, for no justifiable, evidenced reason... than it is for a jurisdiction to decide on mask mandates, which are proven to have a correlation with better public health outcomes and are justifiable, evidence policies.\n\nAs for the word \"authoritarian\", we were both using the word accurately but in differing senses. Talking about that could get philosophical and a academic real quick",

So did the vaccines after 6 months. So while ordering the drug wasn\u2019t correct, it wasn\u2019t a bad decision any more than ordering Remdesivir or the vaccine that wanes at six months.\n\n2. As someone who is against all forms of segregation, I totally support his law banning vaccine passports. Anything that divides society into two groups is bad and the governor did a great job pushing back against that. He was also \u201ccorrect\u201d in the sense that vaccine passports didn\u2019t work because the vaccine doesn\u2019t stop people from getting or spreading the virus. In fact, the places that required vaccine passports have pretty much all reversed course. DeSantis was right there.\n\n3. School boards are, unfortunately, controlled by the teachers unions and do not care about children or their wellbeing at all. School boards also fall under the state, which means the governor and state government do have the right to set rules and standards. After years of data it\u2019s been shown that school districts with masks have no effect on COVID-19 cases or deaths in children. DeSantis was right and you just don\u2019t read fast enough to realize it yet.\n\nJust like with the vaccine discrimination, the places that went the totalitarian route have all reversed course. Masks are no longer required in schools other than in places that truly don\u2019t care about children.\n\nAlso, and this can\u2019t be stated enough times because people still refuse to admit it: COVID-19 is not a risk for pediatric patients. It has a substantially lower death rate than RSV and would rank as a mild flu relative to the average influenza strain.\n\nFurthermore, keeping children out of school harms their development and psychological well-being. Young children can\u2019t learn speech and social cues with masks on. The harms are much greater from closures and forced masking than from kids getting a cold.\n\n4. This is an emotion, not an argument. I can\u2019t respond to something this vague. I don\u2019t agree that any COVID deaths were the responsibility of the government. People should be responsible for their own safety and well-being and stop relying on the government to control their lives and keep them safe.",

I'm one of Florida's many gays. Could you please give me a citation on other gays supporting him? It wouldn't be surprising, the Association of German National Jews was a real group that existed during the nazis and infighting is somewhat rampant within the queer community. I tend to keep to myself and not involve myself in the local community, so I wouldn't know- but it's not a claim I'll take at face value.\n\nBy \"illegal to exist\" I mean \"illegal to openly\" exist and if you're a transgender child, illegal to get what is likely to be life saving medical care for you (so, in a more serious illegal to exist sense). \n\nThe \"Don't say Gay\" bill, when read - does nothing, nada, zip, zilch with protecting children from pedophiles. All it does is outlaw even the topic of gender identity / orientation coming up in class K-3 and, with its vague wording makes it practically impossible to bring up the topic safely  4-12 as the only guidance given is that teachers 'must comply with state standards' for what is or is not 'appropriate'. Except. **There are no state standards.** So if, theoretically, some lady of a 12 grader got mad that her daughters teacher mentioned having a wife while being a woman, that lady has grounds to sue under that bill. While it has not reached that point yet, the effect of forcing queer (and non-queer!) teachers of all grade levels to not acknowledge the topic of our existence our of fear of their livelihood is real. If a cis-gendered, straight American history teacher wanted to teach of the Aids Crisis under Reagan and how it decimated an entire generation of queers  for highschoolers, he might hesitate because someone could find it to be 'inappropriate' under the don't say gay bill and sue. The intentionally vague specific language of the don't say gay bill effectively censors the topic of queerness on all grade levels.\n\nThere is also the recent outlawing of gender affirming care for minors. The transgender community is one that already has high suicide rates, [but studies have shown that access to gender affirming care shows a substantial decrease in suicide risk within the group.](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/ga-trans-suicide-press-release/) \n\nNow, to be clear, gender affirming care, especially for minors is typically therapy, presenting as your gender via a change in wardrobe and in more extreme circumstances, puberty blockers. Puberty blockers, I will note, have been used frequently on children for a variety of conditions **and still are**, they are just now illegal for treating gender dysphoria despite being largely reversible. The more (very very very ***very*** rare) extreme cases of gender affirming care in minors is what is known as 'top' surgery, or the removal of breast. Gender affirming care from a reputable source for minors does not involve surgery for any genitalia. Ever.\n\nNow what happens when you take a group of vulnerable children who are statistically more likely to attempt or contemplate suicide than their peers and outlaw helping them in a way that has been proven to help them?\n\nWell. More of them are likely to actually 'pull the trigger' so to say. Obviously.\n\nThat and Ron's general attacks on queer culture such as drag shows, his campaign equating us to 'groomers' the false 'pedophile prevention' framing they sold people on the don't say gay bill - I've seen this song and dance before in the history books. I've read where this song ends where a powerful politician demonizes a group of minorities, it starts out slow, it starts out publicly being about something else. It starts out with laws that make it harder for that minority to exist as who they are in public. Then come laws / policy that target the minority group specifically, typically in a way that the general population might not understand the significance of. Then like a frog in warm water that is starting to boil, it just starts to get more rampant and extreme, without the frog really noticing. I expect it to get worse for queers in FL in the coming 2 years, and for it to be extremely bad for us should Ron be successful in his plight to the presidency. In the the mean time, I am going to continue calling the spade a spade.",

            "comment": "Putting all advanced degrees together is skewing the tables. It would be much more meaningful to see how MBAs voted separately. MBAs tend to lean right politically. Florida is a service industry state and most business owners supported DeSantis's handling of the pandemic. 80+% of businesses in my county are small businesses, and many of the people running those businesses will vote for whatever candidate seems most fincially supportive of their business needs-- regardless of party. As for JDs, the type of work being done can often tilt a lawyer towards a political party, since the world of law can be heavily influenced by policy. Now, when it comes to MAs, MDs and PhDs, I would expect this group to be more objective in the political realm unless working in a university setting. But why are MSs not included? MPHs, DrPHs, LCSWs, and ARNPs should be evaluated separately, as health care is a major element of Florida with our aging population. I would expect many healthcare and public health professionals would lean left, although I am shocked by how many nurses do not. Finally, those with advanced Education degrees were also not specifically called out, although perhaps they are included. Those professionals would typically overperform as blue voters. Immigration from South and Central America is definitely having an impact on Florida politics, so understanding how that plays into voting patterns of persons with advanced degrrees seems important to this poll, as well. And I agree with several other commenters that the last four years has seen an influx of residents with particular views and an emigration of left leaning residents. The Villages was a piece of nothing two decades ago; now a bastion of conservativism in its own city. Persons with advanced degrees who retire to Florida often do so to avoid taxes, although they demand services that require tax revenues. If a retired person with an advanced degree retires and then moves to Florida, they may tend to lean more right politically than someone who is actively practicing using an advanced degree in a particular field in Florida. Understanding how advanced degrees influence voting patterns requires a more nuanced poll, imo.",

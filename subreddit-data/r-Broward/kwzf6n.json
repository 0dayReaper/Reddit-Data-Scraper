I\u2019ve tried Flaco\u2019s and The Gym Boxing and Fitness but had issues with both gyms continuously charging my card after telling them to terminate it.\n\nI\u2019m looking more towards a 1 on 1 personal trainer with credentials as opposed to a boxing cardio workout.",

But he's the real deal, he's super committed, everyone in his gym is super friendly to both pros and amateurs alike. Whether you want to do it just for fitness or get in the ring, it's was a good experience. I was a powerlifter who wanted some cardio and fun and even though I was the worst boxer in the gym everyone treated me great.",

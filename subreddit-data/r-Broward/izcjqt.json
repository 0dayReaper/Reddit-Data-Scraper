            "comment": "I'm not sure this will actually explain it, but I always look to the League of Women Voters site (vote411.org) for information.\n\n**Broward County Ballot Question 1**\n\nExplanation: \n\nOn November 6, 2018, Amendment 10, proposed by the Florida Constitution Revision Commission, and passed by Florida voters, returned all County Charters to the original Florida Constitution provisions and duties for five elected County Constitutional Officers:  Sheriff, Supervisor of Elections, Property Appraiser, Clerk of the Circuit Courts and Tax Collector, effective January 7, 2025.  Basically, this eliminates the Home Rule provision that was placed in the Broward Counter Charter of 1974.\n\nTo partially reverse the effect of this Florida Constitution amendment in Broward County, Broward\u2019s Legislative Delegation proposed House Bill (HB) 989, which was passed unanimously by the Florida House and Senate during the 2020 Legislative session.  HB 989 allows Broward County to place a charter question on the November 3, 2020 ballot, which is shown above.\n\nA Yes Vote returns the duties of ex-officio clerk of the County Commission to the County Administrator; the duties of custodian of all County Funds to the Department of Finance and Administrative Services; and the duties of Auditor to the County Auditor.   The only new duty transferred to the Clerk of Courts is the duty of county recorder, as outlined in Amendment 10.\n\nA No Vote would add to Broward\u2019s Clerk of Courts duties: ex officio clerk of the County Commission, custodian of all County funds , the function of Auditor as well as the duty of County Recorder.\n\n**Broward County Ballot Question 2**\n\nExplanation:   \n\nArticle XI, Section 11.01 is titled \u201cConflict of County Ordinances with Municipal Ordinances.\u201d  This Charter question adds Section11.01 D to allow County Ordinances to prevail over conflicting Municipal ordinances  for specific transportation projects, on County Owned or leased property.  The specific projects would be only those  funded by the voter passed Transportation Surtax.   The ordinances could include zoning, permitting, construction, operation and/or administration of those projects.  Public hearings would have to be held in the affected municipality and any construction would have to match current aesthetic standards. \n\nA Yes vote would allow County Ordinances to prevail for these specific projects on County-owned or leased Property.\n\nA No vote would allow the Municipality\u2019s ordinances  to continue to prevail for these specific projects on County-owned or leased property.",

We need the County to move quickly on these long-delayed transportation improvements and get them done.  Vote YES on Referendum 2",

The city would undoubtedly stop it but if the county had control they would just move forward not caring what the city thinks or wants. Just food for thought, personally torn on this one.",

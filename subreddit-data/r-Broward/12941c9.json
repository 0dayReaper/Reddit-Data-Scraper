    "postText": "Let me give some context. Earlier this week I made a post calling out the enormous spiders at the local broward college campus. I definitely struck a nerve with a lot of the true native with the funniest comment being \u201cshow us on the doll where the spider touched you\u201d ;). I have to admit that my fear of arachnids shouldn\u2019t result in all of them being exterminated, as they\u2019ve already called the place their home long before I even attended campus. With that being said, I\u2019m sorry to anyone I offended or ticked off with my post, as it was very feminine and childish of me to complain about the little critters. They don\u2019t bother me so I won\u2019t bother them.",

Sensitive was the word I was looking for, although \u201cTraits traditionally cited as feminine include gracefulness, gentleness, empathy, humility, and sensitivity, though traits associated with femininity vary across societies and individuals, and are influenced by a variety of social and cultural factors.\u201d From Wikipedia. In this current day, I\u2019m sure we can both agree that there really isn\u2019t a true way of defining feminine/feminism with a solid explanation, but I again don\u2019t mean to offend anyone including you with my words.

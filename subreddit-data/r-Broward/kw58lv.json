    "postText": "Hi Broward people, \n\nI currently live in Weston with my parents and am planning to move out in March of 2021.  I'm 24 and make 60K a year. After taxes and student loans, I have about 40K a year of disposable income. Let's say it's 38K a year after my phone bill and car insurance. So I have about $3,100 a month of disposable income. I'd like to save a nice portion of this each month by not spending so much on rent.\n\nI'm looking for a Studio or small 1bedroom apartment/condo with a kitchen (fridge, stove, oven, laundry, dryer, and a/c). My top preference is a small 1 bedroom apartment with a kitchen, living room, and bedroom. That's all I need. However I can settle for a studio as long as it has a kitchen with all the essentials and a bathroom.\n\nI'm trying to \\*save\\* money on rent and not spend a ridiculous amount on rent, but I know that's very difficult considering I live and work in South FL. \n\nI work by the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport, and I'm trying to keep my commute somewhat short (&lt; 35 min). Ideally I'd like to live somewhere north of 595 and south of Coral Springs. Ideally I'd like to live (&lt; 35 min) from Weston too. My current commute to work is exactly 30 min from my parent's house, and I'd like to keep it about the same.\n\nI'd like to spend less than $850 a month on rent. I definitely don't want to be spending 1000+ a month on rent, but it seems like that's all that's available. So I need reddit's help to see what's my best option for finding a decent place within my budget and also the area I mentioned. The location isn't that important to me as long as it's not \\*super\\* dangerous. I don't mind living in the Sunrise-Tamarac area, Plantation - Lauderdale Lakes, or Margate-Pompano Beach (though I'd be pretty far from Weston which isn't ideal).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I look at rental listings online, they're always too expensive and shitty looking for my budget. Is there some kind of realtor service for rentals in the area that I should use to make this easier and more worth my time?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help would be immensely appreciated!!!!",

On top of that, even if you can make the down payment, your salary/spending ratio would probably give you a not-so-great interest.  Not to mention you'll bend over backwards to find something decent unless you get up to 150k....unless you get into the east of plantation(which i doubt you want).  To be honest, roommate or willing to compromise on location are you 2 best options.",

General advice is to put at least 20% down so you don\u2019t have to pay mortgage insurance but it\u2019s not required.\n\nFor example: This 1 bedroom 1.5 bathroom listed for $64,900 catches my eye. If I wanted to put 20% down, that would be at least almost 13,000 that I would have to put down at closing.\n\nSay you choose a 30-Year Fixed FHA, your payments would be $361 a month. This is why I\u2019m asking if it\u2019s possible for you to put a down payment because IMO paying a $361 a month mortgage for a property you\u2019ll eventually own yourself is better than paying $2,000 a month for nothing to show for\n\nA bigger down payment could increase your chances of getting approval for a loan as well as having good credit.\n\nUltimately a down payment is highly recommended but not required.",

In addition, looks like you are a first time buyer. Find out with a loan officer if there are benefits, like a lower down payment. \n\nThere are cities that offer help through Community Redevelopment Programs. I know a guy that got help through this program and covered his down payment for a home in Chapel Trail. This was many years ago.\n\nAnother, less glamorous avenue is to start looking at the courts, yes, short sales and foreclosures. Sadly, folks are loosing their homes. Find out if your lender deals with those situations. You will have to spend money to fix the home up to par, but you can do it at your own pace.\n\nAsk your parents if they can help you with or part of down payment. \nIf you don\u2019t have money for a down payment, start educating yourself on how to grow what you have. Learn about investing in stocks, options, etc.\n\nBest of Luck.",

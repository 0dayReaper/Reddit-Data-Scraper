    "postText": "Hi I'm hoping someone can give me some advice based on their experience - a very good friend of mine who lives in Broward is in the middle of a manic episode.  They have had negative experiences with psych inpatient services before.  Has anyone had a very good experience for themselves or a friend or family member with an area hospital?  She has Sunshine (?) Medicaid.  Any feedback or suggestions would be appreciated.",

No one-on-one therapy, no group sessions, nothing. Every morning the doctors came to check on my for about five minutes, ask about my meds and my thoughts, and that was it. I was left to deal with things alone when I went in for help. In the end, I lied to get out of there. Till this day im so scarred from my stay there that I won\u2019t even talk, truthfully, to a therapist because im afraid of going through that again. I legitimately thought it was a good thing going to the hospital and left with a very very very different opinion on mental health care.",

You can call 988 to ask them to look for respite houses, which aren't lock down but just safe places to collect yourself. \n\nAvoid Henderson like the plague as well.",

Use it if you have to, but being regimented in your self-care, medications, routine, etc and having a safety plan in place to avoid the cycle of hospitalization is so much better.",

AS MUCH OF IT AS POSSIBLE. FOR AS LONG AS ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE.\n\nSkyland Trail in Atlanta stopped taking my insurance after one week. Of a TWELVE week program (I left ama after 6weeks). \n\nBefore your friend or their family commit to anything, make sure insurance covers as much as possible because once you hit that limit these facilities will bleed you DRY.\n\nEdit: will comment and say that I\u2019ve personally heard negative things abt Fort Lauderdale Behavioral Hospital from one friend. Do with that what you will.\n\nEdit 2: Also, if your friend does decide to go inpatient, make sure to find out whether or not whichever facility your friend ends up doing will allow them to retain access to their cell phone (many places do not). If they do confiscate cell phones, find out the phone number for the facility. Inpatient can be a horribly isolating experience; I promise receiving a call from you to check in or just shoot the shit will mean a LOT to your friend.\n\n Again, my experience was in ATL so it may differ from your friend\u2019s. Mileage may vary.",

It's a way to make sure your crazy diagnosis can be changed and not stick with you 10 years later. At least that what the CIA agents told me to do during my forced debriefing ... No they don't kill all of us, we end up in psyche wards and get debriefed.",

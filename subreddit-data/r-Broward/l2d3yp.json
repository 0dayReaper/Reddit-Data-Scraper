    "postText": "I'm not sure if this is a good place for this question. I've been living in pompano in a apartment with my fiance and son. We've grown out of it. We haven't signed a new lease because it ran out, we asked the landlord and he just never gave us a new one. So we've been here for about 6 months without one. We're looking for a new place now, about to put in applications. Is there any way the landlord can some how kick us out before we're ready to actually leave?  We have a difficult time finding places due to both our backgrounds and last time it took 4 or 5 months with putting in applications.",

            "comment": "Check out Florida Statue 83.46 regarding tenancies. Essentially, if you\u2019re paying rent, even without a written lease, you are likely a tenant. If you\u2019re paying monthly, either party may give 15 days notice to end the lease at the end of the month. (e.g. if notice is given January 5th the tenancy could end January 31st. However, if notice is given January 21, tenancy would not end until at least the end of February.)\n\nWith that being said, you and your landlord can always agree to different move out terms. They cannot remove you without filing an eviction action. \n\nYour situation may also have unique factors. The above information is general legal information and not legal advice. You should contact an attorney if you have specific questions about your situation. https://www.browardlegalaid.org/eviction-assistance",

You need to make a choice that will make sure you and your family have a place to live while not spending too much money (i.e. paying two rents at once).",

He needs to give i believe 30 days notice to vacate.  Otherwise landlord would need to evict.\n\nI'm the same respect, OP is probably on a month to month lease and usually those leases provide the same need for a 30 day notice to leave.",

You should read your original lease for wording.  If it doesn't, florida law I believe is 30 days notice to vacate before they can start eviction process, which they can't do right now.  At the same time, if you are having trouble finding someone to lease to you, it sounds like you have an eviction already or really bad credit, do you want to make it worse?",

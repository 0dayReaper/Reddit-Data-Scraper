    "postText": "I live in Broward and was wondering if anyone here knew or knows if anyone cooks meals for people if you bring them the food and containers? I really like Latin food but am really bad at combining the spices to get the authentic taste.\n\nI've been into fitness lately and was wondering if anyone knew if anyone established or interested in prepping meals for people if they bring them the ingredients? Maybe someone has a stay at home wife who enjoys cooking for people and would like to spend some spare time making extra cash once a week prepping meals? \n\nI'm looking for authentic ethnic food and to possibly come under the cost of daily meal kits from online places like factor and other companies. You could set it up to be donation based to avoid government involvement via health and safety concerns, etc.\n\nI just think there's a market out there, obviously. I can't be the only one looking for authentic meals to fuel fitness and health gains.",

It's a nightmare cooking anything more than spaghetti, and even that's annoying. There's gotta be some wonderful person out there willing to cook me a pot of food or two lol. I refuse to think otherwise",

I'm in desperate search of the graciousness and privilege this golden retriever of yours mayhaps be willing to bestow upon my lazy and entitled ass. \n\nI know for a fact someone out there is thinking,\" I know if I tried to sell my food, it'd sell like hotcakes. They all end up in restaurants tho I assume. Or there's gotta be some kinda state regulations banning this kinda thing outright. There's a reason this isn't a thing.",

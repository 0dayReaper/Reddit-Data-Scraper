I saw on some websites what looks like incorrect information about it being \"more dangerous than 99% of American cities\" which does not jive with what I know, having spent some time there. I'm considering moving there is why I ask.",

I have to agree that east of university gets a bit more sketch. Bars on windows, more convenience grocery places, more trash. West of university was like a different neighborhood. Much nicer.

Not really ghetto, just not high income. Maybe lower middle class working people. Most people keep to themselves in those neighborhoods. Any a lot of the criminals will try and go into the nicer areas anyways. It's a melting pot.",

I was right near 441 and Commercial, and for the most part it was just families trying to get by and live peacefully.  There were a couple party animals throughout the years, couple of couples that liked to fight publicly, but none of the people that lived there seemed harmful.  The part that worried me was the increase in homeless people and the ones who were just passing through.  A lot of people walked in that area and I got to recognize a lot of the people who lived around me.  \n\nI took a lot of care to not leave boxes around to let people know what I had.  Windows stayed shut.  Didn't leave anything in my car.  Some people's apartments and cars got broken into which led me to be very careful about what I left in plain sight.",

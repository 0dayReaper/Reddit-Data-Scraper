    "postText": "Wow, the frustration is real. Wasn\u2019t expecting this to happen today, but hey its life. For those wondering, here\u2019s the full story:\n\nSo as the title implies, I got scammed. I was scammed in the Walmart parking lot on Pines Blvd., right after I walked out with my two cases of protein shakes. Three dudes in a black suv (I\u2019m not a car guy so unfortunately I don\u2019t know the model/make) called out to me and asked if I wanted a sound-bar. In my head I thought \u201cWow, perfect timing, I was just thinking of buying one for my parents as an appreciation gift! I sure am lucky!\u201d\n\nIf only life were that easy. The rundown was that this \u201cSono2 Air 1\u201d soundbar was \u201ccancelled\u201d by the customer, and they said I\u2019d be getting it for a steal. MSRP of $999.99, down to $250 just like that. I was hesitant, but I ultimately gave in for my parent\u2019s sake, and walked away with what I thought was a fantastic speaker. \n\nUntil I did some slight research online: \u201cDO NOT BUY SONO2, SCAM PRODUCT\u201d etc. etc., and it was then I realized my mistake. Not much hope for me, but I thought a PSA would help others if they face the same situation. I didn\u2019t catch their names (assuming they wouldn\u2019t have made it up), but it was a white skinny guy with messed up teeth, and two younger light-skinned guys. Hope this helps anyone if they ever get put in the same position I did.\n\nTL;DR Don\u2019t buy electronics from guys in an SUV trying to hit up strip clubs.",

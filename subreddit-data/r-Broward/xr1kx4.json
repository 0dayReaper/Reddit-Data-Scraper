That should NOT be thrown at EMS if he in any way doesn't want to be seen or go to a hospital.\n\nTypical scumbags reporting it as it wasn't.  If the dickhead was good enough, and agreeable enough, to be driven to a mental health facility by a family member then they would have done so.  He wasn't, and that makes him become open to police screening before EMS would step in.",

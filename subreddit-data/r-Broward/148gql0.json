Alhadeff said the topic is still on the agenda for a June 20 workshop and a July 25 board meeting, but she doesn\u2019t see it passing.\n\n&gt;The announcement came at the end of a raucous and often hostile town hall Monday that attracted about 200 student and parent speakers, all but a few who fiercely opposed the proposed clear backpack requirement, which was made during a secret closed-door session March 28.\n\nThe arguments against clear backpacks include: \n\n- The decision was made behind closed doors\n- \"I send my kid to school with a bulletproof backpack\"\n- It's security theater\n- They're bad for the environment\n- Ridiculous exemptions are employees, visitors, and students involved with sports\n- Data provided in favor of clear bags was sketchy",

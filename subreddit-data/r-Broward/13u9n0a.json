I've seen ads of the new electric bus since early last year all over the buses, and according to [their website](https://www.broward.org/BCT/Pages/NewElectricBuses.aspx), they're going to be \"delivered by Spring 2023\".\nThere's no other info about them and the only I've seen irl is parked and chilling on the 441 bus terminal. \nDoes anyone got any more info? Or is this just a public stunt?",

I'd guess that bus operators need to be trained, anyone doing maintenance needs training and any branding would need to be applied. I don't work in transportation so these are only guesses.\n\nI'd call 954-357-8400 or e-mail cservice@broward.org to find out more. I may do the same because I'm curious too.",

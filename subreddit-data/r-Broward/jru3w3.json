That\u2019s ridiculous. We need more representation in local government.\n\nProposal for reimagining city/municipal government:\n\nThe Bakers Dozen model (working title).\n\n1) Divide the county up into six districts. \n\n2) Each district will be served by 2 councilors, who serve 4 year terms, running in alternating elections. Meaning each of the 6 districts will have 1 seat to vote for every election. Each district will be able to vote for change, yet retain some stability. Councilors MUST live in the districts they represent (and have lived there at least 1 year). \n\n2) The mayor should be the only at-large seat on the council, serving a 6-year term, and only have a tie-breaking vote (Like the Vice President in the US Senate). \n\n3) Councilors may not seek re-election immediately. In order to be eligible to run for (or be appointed to) another seat, they must wait at least a year-and-a-half from their last date of service. Because the mayor is a different seat, councilors would still be able to seek the mayor\u2019s office, while maintaining their councilor position.\n\nThis will lead to 12 councilors and a mayor, which would provide more granular representation.",

This is a nation-wide problem of under representation in municipal governments. \n\nThere are only 7 people representing about 2 million. Only 3-4 seats are up for re-election every year and TWO of those seats are at -large.\n\nIt just seems like there are too few keys to power to effectively protect citizens from regulatory capture. It\u2019s too easy for local companies to get contracts with their elected buddies and install some kind of \u201cgood old boys\u201d network or political machine. \n\nIf we have six seats up for re-election every year, the people would have an opportunity to check the local government significantly every election, while still maintaining some consistency and balance by the six who remain. \n\nAnd that\u2019s not even getting started with how unrepresentative some cities are. In some cities in Florida, all candidates are elected at-large, meaning the same voting bloc is controlling all of the seats, which is completely antithetical to how the division and separation of powers should work.",

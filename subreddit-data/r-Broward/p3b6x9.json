    "postText": "Hello all! I am looking to move back into Broward County in a couple of months and I was wondering if there was a specific way to search for HOA free rentals? Meaning a property that is not governed by an HOA. The method I am using right now is just looking through Zillow to find properties that  don't have an HOA listed but then when you call and ask, if you get a return call, turns out they are governed by an HOA. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI used to live in South Florida and I had a bad experience with an HOA at the time. I'll keep my opinions to myself for what I think of people who work for HOA's, but generally speaking I would like not to have to deal with them if at all possible. Thanks in advance for any help you all can provide!",

For instance, the completely BS parking passes you have to get for your cars or guest passes for the visitors car. Or having to get approval to have a friend come spend the night, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a friend get towed because we went out one night and completely forgot to get the guest pass, totally my fault, but at the sametime I'd rather not have to deal with that kind of stuff.",

If there's a community name, and it states \"gated community\", there is definitely an HOA, but might not have such strict policies on guest parking.\nAlso can tell by how long an approval period is, 30days...probably hoa.",

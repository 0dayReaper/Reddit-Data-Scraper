    "postText": "The window unit in my trailer has stopped working and I am sweating my life away. Inside my room reaches like 90 even in February and i've been searching for a deal on a window unit since i'm poor and can't replace it but i can't seem to find one.\n\n My \"savings\" is about $40 and ive been searching all over but i can't find anything to that regard. I was hoping someone here knows of a place or has an old one they aren't using. even if it's janky and doesn't work great, anything is better than what i have currently",

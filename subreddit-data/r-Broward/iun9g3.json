You will not be toll\u2019ed until construction is complete, those lanes are separated from the main lanes and you go through it again. The fare will be posted on the electronic sign before entering like down in Miami-Dade.",

I went through the camera gate, saw it flash, cursed aloud, then got out of the lane ASAP (I didn\u2019t drive over the barriers).\n\nLong story short: no ticket. I did however receive a piece of mail for someone else who got a ticket at my address for the same type of violation. I only opened it because I assumed it had to be mine. Was it luck? Fate? Divine intervention? I have no clue.\n\nObviously, YMMV",

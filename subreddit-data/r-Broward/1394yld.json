    "postText": "Mandatory clear backpacks are coming next school year in Broward County!\n\nStarting in the 2023/24 school year, a quirky new rule is taking over: students in all grades will be required to use only clear backpacks and bags! This amusing yet proactive measure will come into effect on Monday, August 21, 2023, ensuring that clear bags (purses, duffel bags, fanny packs, lunch boxes, etc.) are the new normal for students from pre-K to grade 12\u2026",

Imagine how this will make students feel having almost no privacy. This won't prevent the next tragedy either.\n\nPlease [contact your schoolboard member](https://www.browardschools.com/schoolboard) to let them know how you feel.",

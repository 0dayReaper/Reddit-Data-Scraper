The mosque is directly across the street from a Chabad...they get along amazingly.  It's the local MAGA \"Christians\" that are throwing the biggest hissy fit here.  They have variances for thier bell towers, but don't want them for the Muslims.",

As a Christian i have never heard a negative word spoken about the mosque.  So please unless you can substantiate your accusations please do not post anti Christian propaganda",

It happens.  These MAGA \"Christian Nationalists\" love to point out when their discrimination against others is considered untenable because they typically have a pretty well-developed victim complex.  Not putting you in that box by any means though.  A quick perusal of the related issue thread on  Next-door app would give you all the evidence you need that these aren't the \"Love thy neighbor\" type.",

Padilla was arrested in Chicago on May 8, 2002, on suspicion of plotting a radiological bomb (\"dirty bomb\") attack. He was detained as a material witness until June 9, 2002, when President George W. Bush designated him an enemy combatant and, arguing that he was not entitled to trial in civilian courts, had him transferred to a military prison in South Carolina. Padilla was held for three and a half years as an enemy combatant.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/Broward/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

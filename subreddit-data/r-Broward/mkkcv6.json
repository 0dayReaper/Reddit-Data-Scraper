They are also offering the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, they will be opening the appointment bookings for them this Wednesday at 7am. I was able to get an appointment for moderna with them. Started waiting on the Publix booking webpage at 7am, by 7:20am I was able to click \u201cbook now\u201d and schedule my appointment for two days later. The webpage will automatically refresh itself so no need to refresh. Here is the link: \n\n\nhttps://www.publix.com/covid-vaccine/booknow",

Google literally has censored anything to do with vaccine reactions, they're first result is about how vaccines are safe. Social media is bombarding everyone with vaccine propaganda on how you should do your part and get vaccinated because they're safe. It's almost like everyone is being conditioned to listen to them without asking questions.",

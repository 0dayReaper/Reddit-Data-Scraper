Ruby Lenora Green, (she ran for Public Defender last year and lost to Harold Pryor) was quite helpful in helping me evaluate the candidates. I plan to call on her again for info at the next election. I\u2019ll post the info here. But to your question, yes, it is so incredibly important to have good people in these positions And it\u2019s a shame that there is an easier way to evaluate candidate. Organizations like the League of Women Voters and political clubs usually have candidate judges come and speak. I hope they start doing that by zoom now that we\u2019re all so used to it. The meetings in person were unfortunately not that well attended.",

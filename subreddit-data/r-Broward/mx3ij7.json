I'd say just find a realtor that does rentals because craigslist is full of bait and switch garbage. Victoria park is nice, Sailboat Bend, Tarpon River, probably neighborhoods by Las Olas as well.",

If not here in the r/fortlauderdale sub.\n\n$1350/mo will likely get you a one-bedroom. The internet has a wonderful website called Zillow.com that lists apartments and prices. There's also [apartments.com](https://apartments.com).\n\nWhat do you consider \"nice?\" There are a ton of new apartments along Federal Hwy (US1) between Broward Blvd and Sunrise Blvd. There are older duplexes and triplexes in the Victoria Park neighborhood, Sailboat Bend and other neighborhoods in the same general area. Young professionals often rent in these areas.\n\nEDIT: In general, 2.5 miles from the beach in Fort Lauderdale proper is where professionals tend to live.",

Margate is a bit closer but further from the highway. Lots of cheap mcmansions in Davie right next to 595 if you don\u2019t mind finding roommates. Good luck!",

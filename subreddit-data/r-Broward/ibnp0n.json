I'm thankful to this sub for telling me about the primaries because otherwise, I will admit, I would never have known about them. I was also happy (though a tad disappointed due to pandemic) to see enthusiasm for local elections. And that wasn't even on the main election day",

So really, wouldn't you rather have informed people with the desire to actually go vote, do the voting?  \n\nI genuinely mean it.  What is OP hoping to gain by practically begging people to go vote?

If people simply show up to vote, cluelessly, it's likely that a person with an ethnic sounding name will get less votes.

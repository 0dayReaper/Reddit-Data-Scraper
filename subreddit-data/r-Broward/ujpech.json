Someone told me to look into him and the charges against him are terrible, BUT the organization that he founded does really good work. I spoke with defense attorneys and folks in the state attorney\u2019s office and they raved about the good work that Florida Justice Center does to help people get their lives back together. \nGood job to this Vice Mayor for taking some bad press to help out folks in his city. I wish more elected officials were this courageous.",

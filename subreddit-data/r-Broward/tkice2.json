But didnt say how big a truck was.\n\nAlso I need to move this much mulch by myself because my wife has fibro.\n\nI gave one wheelbarrow full to my neighbors. I alerted the chipdrop app that I have mulch to give away. Contacted the two people on that app who said they wanted some. Posted this ad on nextdoor neighboor as well as on Facebook market place.",

As I said weeks ago in another thread:     \n   \n&gt; * *Broward County Transit is unreliable to the point that anyone naive enough to actually believe its published schedules and depend upon them for transportation to and from work will soon find themselves fired for repeatedly being late to work despite always being at the bus stop on time.*  \n&gt;   \n&gt; * *One cause of this unreliability is that BCT lacks the flexibility to effectively respond to changes in demand. Suppose that at certain high-traffic times, certain BCT routes between certain stops experience passenger demand which exceeds bus capacity. BCT's response to this is that when the bus is full, the driver intentionally does not stop to load additional passengers and simply drives past bus stops where passengers are waiting to board. Some of these bypassed passengers will likely be fired for being late to work, which does reduce passenger demand but in a highly dysfunctional way. BCT does not even attempt to adjust itself to such demand by adding bus capacity as needed to rapidly eliminate such bottlenecks.*   \n&gt;  \n&gt; * *BCT passengers also stand waiting at bus stops for scheduled buses which never actually arrive due to a breakdown. As there are no spare buses waiting to spring into action to immediately replace a broken bus, passengers once again don't get picked up as scheduled, which can easily have highly disruptive effects upon the lives of those abandoned passengers.*  \n&gt;   \n&gt; * *It is very well established that mass transportation intervals should be no longer than every fifteen (15) minutes, and preferably every ten (10) minutes or less, in order to position mass transit as a viable travel alternative. Proudly ignoring transportation science, BCT's schedules typically provide ghastly intervals of thirty (30) minutes or more.*",

The only investment needed is purchasing the vehicles, which are fungible - they can be sold in case South Florida commuters don't like riding it.   \n   \nLight rail is completely different.  Instead of reusing existing tracks, light rail ***requires the construction of new tracks***.  In fact, the vast majority of the funding goes into building the light rail tracks.  And those tracks are not at all fungible.  They are permanently locked into the place they were built.  If passengers reject the light rail, there's no way to sell these extremely expensive tracks on to somebody else in another state (as one can easily do with commuter rail cars).  It is a permanently sunk cost and there is zero room for error.  \n   \nContrast that with electric busses.  Electric busses are highly fungible and in heavy demand.  Unlike regular (aka heavy) rail cars which can only be sold to users of standard North American rails, electric busses can be sold at any moment to any user throughout the world.   And electric busses can instantly be redirected to more productive routes as needed.  \n   \nIn summary,  \n   \n* Commuter Rail Exit Strategy: Sell the rail cars.  Done!    \n   \n* Electric Bus Exit Strategy: Sell the electric busses.

            "comment": "Broward is so behind in transit infrastructure; and while this is a refreshing step forward, I think additional thought towards future-proofing the system from an operational cost standpoint is still needed. Specifically, while rail transit should rightfully be pursued, light rail is *not* the way to go, but *light metro* is. \n\nFor one, surface running light rail competing with car traffic will never be a service that moves at speeds comparable to driving, such that a significant number of people are convinced to give up their cars. Secondly, the cost of driver operated rail transit in a relatively low density area like Broward means there will never be \"turn up and go\" levels of frequency. \n\nInstead, Broward should follow the lead of Vancouver SkyTrain, Montreal RER, and Copenhagen Metro in the implementation of automated light metro---fully grade-separated driverless technology that allows for high frequency at low operating cost. Might be more expensive up-front to build, but pays for itself in the long-term with significant operating cost savings.",

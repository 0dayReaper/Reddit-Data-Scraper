This bemusing yet proactive measure will come into effect on Monday, August 21, 2023, ensuring that clear bags (purses, duffel bags, fanny packs, lunch boxes, etc.) are the new normal for students from pre-K to grade 12.",

This is meant to \" appear to do something\" not fix the problem which would require a constitutional amendment and real change at the national level. Poverty, hopelessness, and mental health care need to be addressed, along with gun law overhaul.",

Most clear bags on Amazon have mesh pockets.\n2. These bags are notorious for being light utility. I absolutely had moments in highschool I would need to carry 5-6 hardback textbooks. I don't think these bags are up to the task.\n3. Privacy as mentioned by OP. Privacy, to my mind, is something everyone should have some level of.\n4. This is a false security. Backpacks are not 2 dimensional. Even with a clear bag, there are places to conceal things among books and other items. But because of the clear bag, there will be a feeling of safety without actual confirmation.",

    "postText": "I have a guest in town. Because of my apartment complex's strict parking policies, I will need a place to park their car overnight for several days without risking being towed.  Any suggestions (preferably in the Nova Drive/Davie Road area)? Every place I look has some version of a no trespassing/24-hour towing sign.  Street parking seems non-existent near me.",

    "postText": "I was considering moving into a duplex in the broward county area. My prospective landlord tells me that the HOA may charge as high as $2500 as a pet deposit for one dog. Does this sound normal to anyone. I get the feeling he just doesn\u2019t want a dog and is looking for an excuse to push me off living there.",

Emotional support animals can help with things like stress, anxiety, depression, or more. \n\nI don\u2019t remember who I had used for my cats, but the process was super simple and wasn\u2019t too expensive. I think it was less than $200 and it was just a one time fee (and probably a fee when you renew). I filled everything out online then their medical professional called me and asked what about my cats gave me emotional support (i mentioned how they relieve my stress and anxiety). After I was approved, they sent me a letter which I then showed to the office. \n\nI don\u2019t remember who I used but here\u2019s a couple of sites:\n\nhttps://www.esaregistration.org\n\nhttps://usserviceanimals.org/support/faq",

Usually the owner of the property charges the pet fees.  What does an HOA care about pets other than an attack or shit everywhere.  They have no reason to care what a pet does inside a property they do not own.",

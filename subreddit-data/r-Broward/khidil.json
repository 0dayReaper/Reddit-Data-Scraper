    "postText": " \n\nI am a photographer doing a portrait project of people and their favorite treats - sweet or savory. I can be 100% safe and socially distanced to do this. I would like to talk to you about your favorite dessert/savory treat and get to know you a little and then take some images. The entire process would take about an hour. It can happen outdoors or at your home or your favorite restaurant. Feel free to suggest a location! Since you know exactly what you like, I would ask that you procure your treat. I am happy to give you a digital copy of the photo when we are finished.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMessage me and I can share more info. This is not some weird fetish or scam. I love dessert, it's something I'm passionate about, and I want to share it with others.",

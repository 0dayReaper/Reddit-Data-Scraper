The article references reporting done by \u201cFlorida Bulldog\u201d but again I don\u2019t know them. It could just be that local outlets got the jump on the story, but I\u2019m a little skeptical that the AP/Reuters etc haven\u2019t written anything.",

It's well known to be a (if not *the*) local center for investigative reporting nowadays (after the near-death of the *New Times* killed off former title-holder Bob Norman's juicy blockbuster reports).  \n  \nThat said, Sheriff Tony has been a frequent target of the Bulldog, and so far it's been all smoke and no fire.  So being \"a little skeptical\" is certainly in order, just not for the reason you cited.",

Yeah I don\u2019t even wanna go back to hospital to get a repair that would be more time out. Also another question I\u2019m a heavy smoker not cigarettes but weed. Now I let the doctors know cause they asked but they never really gave me a time on how long I should wait so I can smoke again safely with out hurting my procedures and all of that good stuff.  And each scar is about a thumb big nothing to big",

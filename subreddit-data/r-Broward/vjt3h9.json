Scientist don\u2019t know what their doing in their and how your affected by it because they only started researching recently. But they think that microplastic is responsible for lower testosterone in men, weak or sick lungs if plastic is inhaled, and have a few links to cancer. This petition matters because most of the microplastic is produced from washing your polyester clothes. When you wash your clothes the fibers go down into our waste water system which is not designed for microscopic debris so it washes into the ocean where fish eat the plastic and eventually will eat the fish. They say humans eat about a credit cards worth of plastic everyday.",

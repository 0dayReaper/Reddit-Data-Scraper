Guns just allow for that person to do allot of damage in a short amount of time. Other countries have guns and have mental illness, yet they don't have shootings every week. What we have is a gun culture problem. Guns are tools. They should be used and respected as such but when people associate guns/2A with their identify, we start having the issues. People are too quick to turn to guns as the answer for their disgruntled emotions. We also have too much extremism in this country. Pundits rile people up into a hateful frenzy. Then those people feel justified for attacking someone. It's really just a big shit show. \n\nIt's just stupid to me that politicians keep finding bullshit solutions to the superficial issues instead of getting to the heart of the matter. It's unfortunate that our children have to pay the price. Whether it's the fear of being shot while at school, or the constant body searches, and now, the total lack of privacy. School should be a safe space. Schools are becoming more like prisons. Soon we'll have ICE or Geogroup managing the schools.",

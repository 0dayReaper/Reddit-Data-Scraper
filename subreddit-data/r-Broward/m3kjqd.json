The crew that worked very hard to out the new trails together deserve a big pat on the back for making something out of literally nothing.  After the hurricane came through, the government used the fema funds basically bulldoze the entire park that was covered with invasive species of trees.  Totally leveled the trails down to the limestone.  Took years for the brush to come back and give some sort of cover for the trails.",

At that point it was pretty much the only \"mountain\" bike riding you could do anywhere in South Florida.  They didn't even require helmets back then (and my stupid 20 year old ass didn't wear one).\n\nIt's crazy when I see the stuff that goes on at Markham now and there are 1000 people lined up outside the trail on the bigger events.  25 years ago you might only see a few people there riding even during the weekends.",

The trails were destroyed but the nail in the coffin was done after.   The trails probably could have been rebuilt, the single-track was there.",

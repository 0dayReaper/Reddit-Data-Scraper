I\u2019m currently a student there and the course times and locations are flexible\u2014 there\u2019s a north, south and central campus. BC campuses are nicer than Miami Dade College in my opinion, and they\u2019re going to be closer to you. They offer a variety of scholarships, some based on income and some based on merit. Depending on your desired degree program and your budget, FIU and FAU may be good schools to look at as well, but if you need general education credits anyway, then BC is the way to go.",

They seem to only take 25 or so.  I've also heard that the Key Largo DMV takes walk ins and they are not so busy.\nAlso, this service is new https://www.flhsmv.gov/locations/florida-licensing-wheels-flow/   \ngood luck. Please take this opportunity to write or call your County Commissioner and your local FL House and Senate officials to complain. The system is just awful",

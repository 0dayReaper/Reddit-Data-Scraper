    "postText": "So my parents and I have been trying to find a place for my grandmother to live. We were looking into Section 8 but the waitlist is closed. What do we do? Her income is about $800 a month and housing just isn't possible without the Section 8 voucher. What are people suppose to do, be homeless? I honestly have no clue where to go from here. Any suggestions?\n\nI don't mean to sound ignorant, I genuinely am looking for some answers or guidance. Thanks!",

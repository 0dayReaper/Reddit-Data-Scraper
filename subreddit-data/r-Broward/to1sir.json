Who actually owns this thing...\n\nShort story from today adding to where broward county gov priorities are.\n\nI called up broward parks earlier asking them why they use a non official-basketball backboard at a park I went to. They transferred the call to whomever ran the individual park I went to.  Long story short the backboards are most likely local made backdoor dealing non-official in any way shape or form, garbage. Told her the backboards are so bad that it'll turn kids off from the sport all together.\n\nThe lady replied with kids play on the courts all the time and even the summer league. I replied with because the kids don't know any better or have any other choice. She listed off all the parks in the worst parts of ft lauderdale where they happened to install these monstrosities.\n\nYou can tell how much people care about their park when they won't even replace tattered nets that look like they've been that way for 2 years.",

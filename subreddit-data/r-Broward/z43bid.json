That being said, it's probably not the bulk of their ridership.\nThis is the general challenge with civic engagement  and public comment. Many of the opportunities aren't accessible for people directly impacted due to a variety of reasons(e.g. childcare, being a caregiver, transportation, not working 9-5, etc.).",

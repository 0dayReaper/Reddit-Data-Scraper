            "comment": "The outrageous antics of Chayse Billie, upon being released from Broward County jail last night was proof of serious problems with court system. The judge displayed total disregard for public safety, allowing bond for a clearly dangerous, mentally disturbed person. A predator, obviously perpetrating what can only be described as a contract killing, of a mixed breed dog. Methodically photographing animal, seemingly in contact with someone by phone. Then, with cold, calculated precision, emptied his semi automatic pistol, into defenseless animal. Mob style hit, on a dog with no monetary value. Defies any logic, reason, or even simple decency. The owner of dog, seems strangely sanguine, repeating same lines in every interview, as if rehearsed. Most bizarre, was his statement \"at least he won't hurt anyone now\"... Based on what? Billie showed no remorse, self awareness, or slightest bit of humanity, as he taunted reporters, asking.. \"where did you get the gun?\". Billie obviously no stranger to law, many arrrests, protected by Seminole tribe. Why didn't judge charge him with illegal possesion firearm, reckless discharge... Was the gun recovered? No one knows. I call on state attorney to look into this outrageous display of wonton, lack of concern the safety of our community\n\nAlso, there is more here than just an abuse case. There is clear motive of racketeering, in the form of intent to perpetrate a frauduent, fundraising scheme.\r  \nU.S. Attorneys \u00bb Southern District of Florida Ft.

Investigations showed most victims were either suicidal, intoxicated, mentally ill or had gone around barriers at an intersection in an attempt to beat the trains, which travel up to 79 mph (128 kph) through densely populated areas between Miami and West Palm Beach.\u201d",

The only thing I pushed back for was to point out those who are suicidal, intoxicated (to some degree) or mentally ill. If you\u2019re just trying to cut across the tracks before the train, you\u2019re being an asshole.",

Would certainly help in hot weather.)\n\nThough I'm amused at how they have a thing to simulate motor noises because they're \"too quiet\".  Kinda tells you how much noise there is from elsewhere around us that they can't expect pedestrians to hear the sound of bus tires rolling across the pavement, and tells you how much internal-combustion cars contribute to making our lives noisier.",

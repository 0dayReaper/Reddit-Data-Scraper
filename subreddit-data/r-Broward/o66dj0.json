If possible, please link the source of the code/ordinance.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve looked through the library codes but nothing is clear about adding additional roommates",

I\u2019ve never been bothered about it but I have been audited by county inspector fir homestead tax. Never give up your homestead, if they give you a hard time, reduce your square footage by the rooms rented.  Keep the 3% property cap at all costs.  I learned the hard way when I got bad advice from a property manager and from the inspection",

Well, what is a \"family?\" Codes sometimes do define that. As far as I can tell and was told, \"House Hacking\" is not a violation, but as someone else said, HOA could be another big issue.",

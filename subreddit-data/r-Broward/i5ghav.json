    "postText": "I spent the last two months in a mental health residential treatment facility (not in Florida). I am returning to work in South Broward and my therapist and I are struggling to find transitional housing.\n\nThere are many halfway houses, but I have never had issues with addiction/substances. Most of the group homes/transitional housing are for people with developmental disabilities, substance abuse issues, or AIDS. \n\nI do not qualify for programs targeting homeless/low income individuals but I cannot afford the rent down here. My therapist feels that moving back home with my family will cause me to relapse with my mental health issues. \n\nDoes anyone know of any transitional housing just for mental health?",

I couldn't find any information about whether they have put anything together yet, but I'm sure they would know of any existing options in the area.\nBest of luck!",

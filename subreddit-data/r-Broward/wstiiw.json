Make them felons unable to run for office (or get a loan, or own a gun) if they used the office for personal gain.\n\nA trail also forces us to flesh out the difference between actual crimes committed and trying to vaguely pin the MSD tragedy on them.\n\nI worked on several of the larger school projects you've see in the Sun Sentinel, including designing the single point of entry systems. Nothing was going to stop that kid from shooting his school. The solution to that was societal, not construction or design or budgeting.\n\nThey should have had jury trials with the opportunity to present evidence, and the opportunity to retain their jobs if their ineptitude does not amount to willful actions or negligence. Because then it's on the voters to decide, not the State executive branch.",

I think the broward school board is an atrocity and I\u2019m glad that my kids will now have competent people in charge of their schooling.\n\nAlthough I must admit my opinion on these people was set a year ago. \n\nThey all deserved to be fired for refusing to follow the state masking guidance while they themselves were at parties getting drunk with each other maskless. School board members don\u2019t get to pick and choose which state or federal laws they follow. They were out of control.\n\nRegarding MSD: it was way too vulnerable. Multiple easy entry points, a cowardly cop and nobody else with a gun able to fight back. The restricted access points are a good change. This red alert system though? Idiotic and traumatizing for kids. There are 4+ false alarms per year at every school. You don\u2019t need an alarm for a shooter. Guns are not quiet.",

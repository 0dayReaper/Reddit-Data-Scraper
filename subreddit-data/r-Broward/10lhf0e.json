    "postText": "I'm guessing the title suggests my request.  I had a great pcp in Dr. Alhomsi, but he doesn't take my new insurance,  Humana. My main ask is for an internal medicine doc who doesn't suck and who doesn't foist me off on midlevels( NPs or PAs). Extra points if they do include residents in their practice (as part of their training, not as primary). Also, as a dude in his mid-50's I guve extra- extra points for someone with small fingers.",

Even before everything was online that was one of the things they would  do \u2014 they\u2019d publish an annual list of the providers on their network. But they\u2019re forbidden by layers of contracts to even comment on quality or capability. I spent a good chunk of my career coding \u201cphysician finders\u201d for hospitals and insurance companies, and most of the time we couldn\u2019t even sort the docs alphabetically \u2014 we had to do pseudo-randomization to be \u201cfair\u201d.  So no, I\u2019m looking for more than just a list of docs in their network.",

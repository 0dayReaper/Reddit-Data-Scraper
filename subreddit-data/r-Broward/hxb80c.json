See https://www.broward.org/CoronaVirus/Pages/default.aspx.\n\nBasically, in ANY situation (indoors or out) where you cannot consistently maintain 6 feet distance from others, it is technically mandated. So, for example, crowded park, busy jogging trail, outdoor concert, etc. Best practice is to have one on you when you go outside in any event, even if in a park or walking, since in many circumstances you can't consistently maintain 6 feet.",

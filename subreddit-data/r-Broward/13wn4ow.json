I used to live at Hiatus and Oakland and all the crazy traffic trying to get into those turning lanes made it nuts. People diving across 3 lanes after the light at Pat Salerno, just stupid. \n  \nThey completely did not read the tea leaves on where a lot of the ticket sales (for hockey anyway) would be coming from. The inability to get directly into the arena coming from the north, and directly onto the highway heading back north, is idiotic.  \n  \nOtherwise IMO the arena and location is great, but that was a massive miss not making ramps for all directions on the Sawgrass.",

If fact, traffic and parking are much worse in the area during peak periods of Christmas shopping.\n\nWhy would you think this would be an issue?",

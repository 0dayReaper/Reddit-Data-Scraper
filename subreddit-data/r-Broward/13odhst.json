The owners are very friendly and if you mention your game nights, they may be able to reserve some seats for you and your friends. From personal experience I went in not expecting much, but the owners actually take their time to get to know you and make sure your taking care of. And that's from not only my personal experience but also what I see.",

A few years ago a friend and I were talking about using D&amp;D at another local game shop as a way to reach out to kids and young adults, dreaming up ideas of an after school program or something of the sort.  We were in over our heads and life got in the way for my part, but he did get a couple small groups out of the venture that developed good relationships.\n\nI just love to see that sort of thing in action.  Kudos to these people for their kindness.",

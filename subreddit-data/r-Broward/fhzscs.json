We need to lock down this state **now** and all stay  home for awhile.   Given our aging population and that this disease hits older people very hard, unless our leaders wake the fuck up we will not have enough resources, e.g. hospital beds and ECMO machines,  to handle all of the cases.   We all need to practice social distancing and keep everything disinfected.",

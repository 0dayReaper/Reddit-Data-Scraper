Once commissioners DO create a law banning it, the industry\u2019s lawyers show up and convince them that private lot owners need a way to enforce parking rules (without booting or towing).\n\nCommissioners almost always give in and write a new law that allows it with certain requirements. That\u2019s what happened in Miami (where it was recently legalized) and a few other municipalities in Dade. And that\u2019s what will now happen in Broward over the next few months.\n\nThere\u2019s just too much money to be made from private tickets, which the city/county gets a cut of.",

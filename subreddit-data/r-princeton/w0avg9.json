    "postText": "I'm a prospective student and will be in the area today. Are there any buildings I could go inside without any card access? Are any buildings not locked to the public? I'm specifically interested in exploring EQuad and the surrounding buildings, but anything would be fine.\n\nI saw here: [https://ehs.princeton.edu/VisitorPolicy](https://ehs.princeton.edu/VisitorPolicy) that the restricted visitor policy was effective until May 16, 2022, so I thought some buildings may possibly be open to the public. Thanks for the help!",

Will i still have to pay for my own books, toiletries, food and the like?  Any info would be appreciated",

I think its mentioned in princeton housing whats covered but u shouldnt worry abt this till closer to movein. \nFood will be covered by aid.\nAlso theres first gen low income programs that help give yall stipends and loans and stuff, and can help answer questions",

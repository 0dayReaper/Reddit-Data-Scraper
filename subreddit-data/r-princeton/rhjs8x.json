            "comment": "Depends on the certificate - many work like your major in that you don\u2019t join until the end of sophomore year, some you can join earlier, some you can join later. Most of them you don\u2019t actually have to apply to - like a major, you just take the required courses and then sign up and satisfy any independent work requirements. A few do have actual applications, but many are just glorified signups",

My freshman summer, sophomore winter and sophomore summer swe internships were all from this google doc",

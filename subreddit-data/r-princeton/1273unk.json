    "postText": "I applied and was accepted REA but did not qualify for financial aid.  I\u2019m very lucky to be able to afford $40k per year towards college, however with Princeton\u2019s full cost being ~$80k, I would need to take loans out for ~$160k to pay off all four years. \n\nMy family and I already reached out to see if there was anything more the financial aid office could offer but unfortunately the answer was no.\n\nShould I still be considering Princeton as this would be considerable debt to take on.",

            "comment": "You can certainly get back in touch with the financial aid office to see if they can walk you through the specifics of why you didn't qualify for aid.  Maybe you made a mistake in the FA application or left off important information.  Or maybe your parents have more assets than you realize and while they are unwilling to contribute more than $40k per year, they actually have enough to afford to pay full freight.  You can also find out if your parents pay the full amount your first year, will that deplete their assets so much that in subsequent years you will qualify for some aid.  You reapply for aid every year, and if there is a significant change in income or assets, the aids gets appropriately adjusted.",

I used to work at Princeton and we were all told about how the average student debt at graduation is around $6k.\n\nI guess the average doesn't give you the range. Or (and?) the figure could be calculated in some kind of an intentionally misleading way.",

You're gonna take at least 6 years to pay all of that unless you're going to a career like advocacy or doctor, but even that, being a doctor would still come with extra costs, since you need even more education than those 4 years of college.\nWith the economy going down the way it's going, I wouldn't advice taking more than 40k of debt, unless you want to live a life of never traveling and renting a good apartment once you finish college.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that my cousin got into Dartmouth psychology, and is still paying 7 years after she finished college. She's got a good job, but she spent a good part of her twenties not enjoying life and being a workaholic from the Ivyes mentality",

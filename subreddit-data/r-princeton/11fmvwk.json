    "postText": "Hello, I am starting my PhD in Fall 2023 and want to know some information about graduate housing. I searched the previous threads and looking for something more.   \n\n\nI am not comfortable with eating in dining regularly and will be cooking myself. Therefore, I think Annex will be a good choice for me. However, how strong the chances are to get into the annexes?  \n\n\nI also want to know about the living condition in different annexes. It would be great if anyone living there can share their experiences.  \n\n\nAny overall advice and suggestions will be appreciated.",

There is no opportunity for temperature control despite the fact that they reach well over 100 degrees in the summer heat, they are full of roaches, and it\u2019s essentially a money racket to force you into a meal plan that you\u2019ll almost never get full use of. Plus, they coddle graduate students like we\u2019re a bunch of fucking children, rather than adults capable of making independent decisions. \n\nI am 28 and stuck in these dorms because of housing costs, and it\u2019s miserable. NGC is a nightmare. It\u2019s the worst housing I\u2019ve ever lived in in my life, and I grew up low income and rural. They should be sued for being slumlords. They\u2019ll tel you that they can accommodate housing cases if you have additional needs, but it\u2019s a lie. They say that to cover their asses. They also complain that they are beholden to the fire code, but I\u2019m fairly certain this is also a lie they use when convenient to keep from being accountable for their poor planning. When I called and complained about it reaching 106 degrees in my room last summer, they said it was \u201cout of their hands.\u201d (I\u2019m sorry, you don\u2019t have some of the world\u2019s top notch climate scientists warning for years that NJ is going to deal with increasingly intense heat crises? Oh, you do? And you didn\u2019t\u2026 listen to any of them? That sounds like a you problem, why am I ducking paying for it?) \n\nUnfortunately, off campus housing is impossible to land. The apartment complexes are probably the best option.",

You\u2019ll still have your own room, just have to share a bathroom with your roommate. No great kitchen options though. The first year is pretty intense in most programs, you may appreciate not having to deal with making all your own meals. Plus then you likely need a car.",

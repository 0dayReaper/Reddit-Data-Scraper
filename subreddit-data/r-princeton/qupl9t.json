Does COS 226 rely heavily on things covered in 126, or would I be able to do well in the class having paid not much attention in 126?",

It\u2019ll be a lot of new concepts and C is a pain to work in. I took 217 the semester after 226 and that worked well",

If OP is just now taking 126, I'd probably just go to 217 to build the chops up first, but a lot will depend on who's teaching what course when. For either class, a bad professor can make it a miserable experience.",

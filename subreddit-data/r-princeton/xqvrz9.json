    "postText": "Hey hi,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I am thinking of applying to Princeton due to the really generous fin aid/having subjects I'm interested in. I graduated from CC officially in June 2022 (though I finished classes in 2021, just so issues with getting my AA). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy GPA is 3.89 round up to 3.9, did a lot of clubs and whatnot, have my letters of rec. Anything advice on transferring, things I should know? I've read on here that CC students are mainly the transfer folks besides military, so maybe that boosts my chances? Any comments are welcomed, thanks!",

I\u2019d definitely recommend applying.\n\nshoot me a pm if you\u2019d like to talk more about the app process",

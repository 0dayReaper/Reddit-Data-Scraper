ChatGPT can pretty much complete the assignments of all introductory classes, and let\u2019s be real\u2014for STEM classes, it\u2019s virtually impossible to detect it, so long as the student isn\u2019t a complete idiot. \n\nFor example, all coding assignments in introductory classes can be completed in a matter of minutes. So too with math and Econ assignments. Personally the only solution I see is for Princeton to significantly reduce the impact of homework on grades and instead rely on _in person_ exams, but what are your thoughts?",

    "postText": "President Erdogan of Turkiye appointed Hafize Gaye Erkan, Princeton PhD holder and ex-Goldman Sachs MD as the new head of Central Bank of Turkiye. As a Turkish citizen I am pretty happy, especially when I compare her to the previous incompetent screwing the economy.  \n\nApparently she completed her PhD in Financial Engineering in just one year. How it\u2019s possible? Is this something common in Princeton?",

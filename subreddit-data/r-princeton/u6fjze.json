    "postText": "Trenton is the closest metropolitan area to Princeton, but bus/train tickets from DC to Trenton look really expensive (&gt; $100 one way). \n\nThe two other options I'm considering are taking a bus from DC to either Philly/NYC and taking the NJ Transit train from the train station to Princeton Junction (\\~$60 one way), but this seems sub-optimal.\n\nAnyone have recommendations for more efficient / cheaper ways to commute between DC and Princeton?",

Don't expect the wifi to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.ourbus.com/routes/dc-to-hamilton](https://www.ourbus.com/routes/dc-to-hamilton)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut like others said, Amtrak from Princeton Junction is by far the most convenient, and gets cheaper if you can book &gt; 3 weeks out. Watch out for sales, and sticking to travel on weekdays helps too, and you can find tickets for as low as \\~$50-60",

It definitely is annoying and a lot can go wrong, but the transfer in Philly doesn't require much walking since the bus leaves from near 30th Street station.",

Bse requires only one semester of independent work, with flexible requirements on the final writeup; ab needs two junior papers and a senior thesis. Bse declares major after year one; ab after year two. \n\nDistribution requirements are totally different as well; bse requires a handful of humanities courses that can come from almost anywhere, while ab students have a wide variety of distribution courses that need to be satisfied for a well rounded liberal arts education.",

Then they add on more specific/intense math/science requirements.",

What\u2019s most useful to you in life is: \nthe material you learn (and learning the ability to learn complex things quickly)  &gt; the connections you make, alumni network &gt;&gt; the school you went to &gt; your major &gt;&gt; everything else\nJust choose bse vs ab at Princeton based on wha the requirements for each are and which you\u2019d rather do. I think the cos bse doesn\u2019t require a senior thesis? The only other thing I would say is that no matter what you choose I would always recommend to do the senior thesis. It\u2019s an incredible experience if you find an advisor you like",

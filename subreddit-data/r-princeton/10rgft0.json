    "postText": "Hi guys, I\u2019m not sure if I can post here because I\u2019m not admitted but I was just wondering if Princeton AOs ever review the additional files you submit. I made a program based off of the Fibonacci sequence + formula and turned it into art. I asked the admissions people if I could upload it as an art supplement but they said to upload it as an additional file (which is totally fine) but I\u2019m just worried they won\u2019t look at it. My essay was subpar but not too bad, I\u2019m kind of relying on everything else I\u2019ve done but that essay lol",

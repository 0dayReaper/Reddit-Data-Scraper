Kay and I went down to Princeton on the 1.24 with Dick's mother and father. I've had more fun with Dick and Sid -- but I must write about the prom. 200 couples and 200 fellows stag. And Mick Markel's orchestra. And such boys - I had as many as ten for one dance. Ed Harris and Pete Swaney! Sid . The peppiest concert until 11. supper at one and breakfast at five. Got to bed at seven P.Q. Oh what a beautiful time. Rave on!\n\nMick Markel probably should be Mike Markel's orchestra. Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnR-lpXLX-M\n",

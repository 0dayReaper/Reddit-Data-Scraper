    "postText": "Good afternoon,\nI am in the ib program and am attempting to get the ib diploma. My worry is I won\u2019t be able to do well enough on my French class to get it. I just got into Princeton and was wondering if anyone\u2019s admissions have ever been revoked based on their ib test scores. There is nothing on my acceptance letter based upon getting admissions revoked by grades or my ib scores.",

Very good in terms of pay and a FAANG internship is great for your resume.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter what year besides junior year when a return offer matters. Levels.fyi is a good site to check out for other CS internships/pay.",

Companies like Citadel, McKinsey, Goldman, Morgan Stanley, then big tech companies tended to be highly desired. \n\nBut also, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s competitive. Happiness comes from inside and not from getting a college internship that looks good on LinkedIn. If you think you\u2019d learn a lot from Amazon, go for it",

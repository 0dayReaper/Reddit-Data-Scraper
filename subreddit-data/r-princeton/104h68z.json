            "comment": "Well it depends a lot on the type of class you\u2019re taking! Lectures are what you\u2019d imagine (without the prof randomly calling on people like movies), whereas \u201cclasses\u201d and \u201cprecepts\u201d are usually much more hands on/discussion based. For example, in language classes there will only be up to around 12 students in a given section (I actually only had five students in my spanish class last sem), so everybody needs to talk in class and pay attention. Other large courses, though (think intro classes), will have both a lecture and a precept, where around 30 students will meet outside lecture with a preceptor to ask questions, do practice problems, discuss things, or even learn more content. As for your hand raising question, profs USUALLY won\u2019t resort to that\u2014but they definitely will if nobody answers their questions. My MAT201 (multivariable calc) prof, for example, made a habit of asking everybody at least one question throughout the class to sort of guide the content",

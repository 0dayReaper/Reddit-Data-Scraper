I'm an international student and I want to focus on politics, IR and economics and possibly apply to law schools in the US afterwards. Can you please give me some advice and some points that I have to consider about each of these schools?\n\nThank you so much!!",

            "comment": "dont pick Princeton so a fellow intl can get off the waitlist \ud83d\ude4f JK LMAO honestly i would go with Princeton since they seem to be really strong on your areas of interest (poli and IR especially) but I would also be really conflicted with Yale because from what I've heard the Yale student body is more chill and collaborative plus the residential college experience would be really unique and cool to me (dont forget the food) - also if you want to go to Yale law school, they show a slight unintentional bias toward yale undergrads but you obviously won't have any trouble getting to YLS from Princeton. Both their programs are very strong so it comes down to student experience and personal factors. Anything specific you're looking for in your uni experience? One more unique thing ab Princeton i like is the emphasis on independent work and the senior thesis, u could probably form really good relationships with professors working on those which could also help you get really good LORs",

            "comment": "Stanford undergrad to Princeton grad school here. Honestly when it comes to these schools I'd recommend visiting if you can and just picking based on vibe, they all have great academics. Princeton's main advantage would be its undergrad focus, but honestly I felt very prioritized as an undergrad at Stanford (this may be major dependent, however). Personally I prefer the vibe and campus of Stanford, it's far more energetic and upbeat since the weather's nice all year round. Princeton comes off as a more intense place to me, whereas being at Stanford honestly felt like being at summer camp a lot of the time. If you like the dark academia type of aesthetic, though, Yale and Princeton have the edge there.\n\nIf you want law school then GPA is crucial. I know Princeton doesn't have grade inflation like it used to, but Yale and Stanford might be slightly easier schools to pull a 3.8+ at. Can confirm it was relatively easy to get good grades at Stanford unless you're premed or something.",

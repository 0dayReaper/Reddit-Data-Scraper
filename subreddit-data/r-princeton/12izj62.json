    "postText": "Hello, my grandparents live in Lambertville and are looking for some help with basic housekeeping tasks. They need someone to stop by a few times a week and help with cleaning, meal prep, and basic tech support. No more than 20 hours per week, probably even less.\n\nThey don't have any serious medical issues and are fully capable of walking by themselves, but as they get older and more forgetful we'd like to know that someone is there checking in on them. \n\nPlease send recommendations if you have them! My grandparents speak English, but their first language is Russian so we would really prefer a Russian-speaking person.\n\nThanks :)",

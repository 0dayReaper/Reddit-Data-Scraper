            "comment": "I visited and committed a few weeks ago as a grad student! Princeton is unique for grad housing since the school is small. Housing is guaranteed for a few years and most grad students live in NGC or OGC for year one. It isn\u2019t like undergrad dorms where you share a room \u2014 almost everyone has a single of some sort, and you automatically qualify for an apartment if you have a partner or dependents!\n\nI was also unsure before talking to other students; so you may want to ask your advisor to connect you with people in your lab to chat with.\n\n\nEdit: Also, I\u2019m not 100% sure, but someone mentioned that the housing application isn\u2019t binding and you have the option to not accept whatever they offer. I\u2019d double-check this though.",

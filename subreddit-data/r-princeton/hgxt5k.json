It's not like people in the campus community don't have informed opinions on this. [The school's own report on this issue came out four years ago](https://www.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/documents/2017/08/Wilson-Committee-Report-Final.pdf) (though many have justifiably criticized that this report is a pretty kid gloves treatment of Wilson, it still more or less gets the point across)\n\n2) The guy's entire comment was the answer to \"If not, why the change?\"- it's an equally valid question to ask why we should keep the name in the first place. A name is inconsequential at best and harmful at worst, and the action that mitigates harm the most is renaming things. This is true even if Wilson isn't suitably racist for your sensibilities- given how many people have made relevant arguments that Wilson's name doesn't add to the campus environment, why \\*should\\* we keep it?",

It will cost to reprint all references to one of America's presidents. More to the point, where will it end? Will you tear down all monuments to Clinton because he fucked an intern's mouth? What about JFK? He stuck his dick in anything that moved? Remove all JFK monuments? Martin Luther King Jr was a renowned rapist. Do we tear up all his memorials?\n\nYou started this, now finish it.\n\nI look forward to your profound response.",

                                            "comment": "The \"cut'n'paste\" answer was simply me pointing out that the amount of writing and conversation around this issue has been so extensive for half a decade that the fact that you're not aware of it says more about your knowledge of the topic than it does about the comprehensiveness of the post you were responding to. Your ignorance on the conversations around Wilson's legacy is certainly not my fault, and there's no need for every conversation about how we'll deal with Wilson on campus to retread this ground, just like there's no need to re-teach students how to read when we ask them to analyze writing.\n\nRegarding cost, I simply can't see this as a serious argument. I can't think of many, if any, actual physical references to Wilson's name on things around campus- even the lion statues that mark the entrance to what was Wilson College are labelled \"Class of 1879\", not with his name, and the building that houses the Public Policy institute is Robertson Hall, and I'm not aware of any physical references to his name here either. So, what then? Updating the websites? You can do that with simple copy-and-replaces. Printing fliers/paperwork? They get reprinted every year anyways. And if this is such a problem with renaming things, why didn't the report published by the committee dedicated to analyzing all of the issues around renaming things mention it at all? Most damning to this argument is the fact that the name of both Wilson College and academic buildings named after Wilson have \\*already been changed before\\*, which, again, you would know if you were actually familiar with the report. Obviously the cost was not a significant impediment the first time they changed the name.\n\nRegarding your second point, this, again, has already been answered in the thread above you- we shouldn't shy away from criticizing historical figures, and none of them have an obligation to have their name put on anything. The rest of your argument is a ridiculous slippery slope fallacy- we have the freedom to critically analyze any historical figure, but that does not mean that we are obligated to do so, nor does it mean that our analysis has to come to the conclusion that we should remove references to their name. Furthermore, it also doesn't follow that removing references to their name is a \\*bad idea\\*, especially if a more critical analysis of their history and impact on our institutions wasn't actually positive. I would argue that if somebody had significant negative impact, we shouldn't want things named after them anyway.",

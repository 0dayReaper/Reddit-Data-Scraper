    "postText": "So I know it sounds kind of crazy but the HPA website said that public and international affairs are one of the most successful pre-med majors at Princeton and I love policy but am also super interested in medicine and don\u2019t know what route I\u2019ll ultimately choose (law/public sector or medicine). However, I know I have to start working on pre-reqs and was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to accomplish this successfully or just in gen? Also, if I\u2019m invited to FSI and do it, what would make the best secondary course? \n\n\nThanks",

            "comment": "Hi there! While I am a pre-med and politics or anthro major, SPIA isn\u2019t that far off and I considered SPIA for a time so I know what goes into it somewhat.\n\nFirst off, I did FSI and definitely recommend it if you get invited. It\u2019s a great way to get some courses under your belt (with easier grading imo) that can give you some wiggle room later on if you need to drop a course to take a lighter load. I took the SOC/POL one and it was fine, nothing to write home about. They\u2019re pretty good about placing you in the one that matches your interests I think.\n\nAs far as doing pre-med and SPIA, imo it really isn\u2019t as difficult as some people may have you believe. SPIA pre-recs are only 4 classes, and those classes are either super flexible or are large classes that many students take, so provided you take 1 each semester in freshman and sophomore year, you\u2019d be plenty set to major in it.\n\nThe same thinking goes for pre-med. Depending on how you choose to plan your schedule, you\u2019ll be taking 1-2 pre-med classes each semester. The only real downside to doing pre-med and SPIA together (along with any non-natural science major really) is that your choice of electives and taking weird and strange courses is going to be a little thin, because each semester will have you taking 3-4 classes (likely 4 in freshman and sophomore year especially) to meet either major requirements, pre-med classes, or distribution requirements. If you\u2019re fine with that, it\u2019s plenty doable to do those two things while here. If you\u2019re not fine with that, you can always go up to 5 classes in a semester and diversify your semesters a bit more at the cost of more work. It\u2019s really up to you what you feel you can handle.\n\nHopefully that helps! If you have any other questions feel free to ask!",

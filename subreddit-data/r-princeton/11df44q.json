    "postText": "Hi, I am an undergraduate student from NYC. I\u2019m moving to Princeton this summer for an internship. I don\u2019t know anyone there. So I was wondering, Is there are any summer activities, clubs, or events at Princeton for outsiders where I can meet people? I would love to meet some new people from there and maybe make some new friends along the way.\n\nAny suggestions are appreciated! \ud83d\ude0a",

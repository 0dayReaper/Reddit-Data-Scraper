Try to be unlike the elitist stereotype that many Princeton alums become - growing up in Princeton and not being part of the university has allowed me to experience so many people looking down upon me for no other reason besides not being part of PU. \n\nThey definitely will train you on this etiquette - that you are special and smarter and better than others -  and that you can and should look down upon others who are not part of the elite Princeton alum group ; you should reject this and be more inclusive. Or just do it and get your nice investment banking job making tons of money after studying social science with the intention of doing wonderful things for the world - as is the pathway of most Princeton grads.",

Although there have been some tragic cases this year, I don't think it's accurate to say that there are \"lots of suicides\" when compared to other schools or to the general population. College can be a high pressure environment, but it also provides opportunities to build community and friendships, and allows you to pursue a whole variety of interests. Like many schools, the mental health resources at Princeton have been pretty overwhelmed recently so I would encourage anyone struggling with suicidal ideation to seek proper support off campus to supplement campus resources.",

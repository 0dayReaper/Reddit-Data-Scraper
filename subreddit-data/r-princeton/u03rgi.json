    "postText": "Hi, I go to the University of Michigan, a fairly up there uni, yet, there are plenty of classism issues where many who came from a poor background may feel uncomfortable because it's hard to afford things around here, and the type of things those from wealthier backgrounds talk about / their perspective due to their background just ends up being off putting. I usually don't think much of my race, and yet, I feel so, alienated because so few come from the type of background I did, and don't seem to care to really learn about it and would rather virtue signal.\n\nSo, I've been wondering for a while, do the same issues exist at Ivy League schools? Do you all deal with issues where the classes are hard but all of the resources meant to help students tend to be bogged down / unusable because there aren't enough staff to help the number of students that need those resources? I wanted to kinda survey different ivies about this. Thank you in advance for sharing your opinion.",

Which option do you recommend and why? Is it possible to get access to the kitchen? (PS: I have already read all the information I could find on the Princeton website)",

            "comment": "Hey!\n\nBiggest difference is age of people living in them. Residential college will be largely 18-20 year olds (freshman and sophomores), and Upper class dorms will be 20-22 year olds.\n\nAdditionally, res colleges have more structure and have an associated dining hall. They will have events at the dining hall/dorm, you\u2019ll have an RCA (like a dorm advisor), and in general a little more structure. Depending on which res college you\u2019re in, you may be able to walk to the dining hall without going outdoors (nice in winter!) whereas this isn\u2019t an option for the upper class dorms. Another factor is location - upper class dorms are more central to campus (in general). \n\nIn terms of kitchens, res colleges will have a common kitchen you can use, but it would be hard to cook regularly in it on your own I think. Some upper classman dorms (Spellman) are like normal apartments, with a private kitchen \u2014 these are popular and possibly not available to you, but are easiest setup for cooking on your own. There are also co-ops in upper class dorms where people use a common or dedicated kitchen to take turns cooking that would probably be open to you - but I think you\u2019d have to wait to learn more / sign up until you are on campus. I don\u2019t think there is a price difference, though dining hall meal plans are a significant difference across plans you can choose from.\n\nIs there a reason you want to cook on your own? Quite common to just eat in dining halls. \n\n\nHappy to answer anything else that is helpful!",

                            "comment": "They actually just changed it this year - upperclassmen living in res colleges are no longer required to get a meal plan.\n\nTo respond to OP\u2019s other questions, at least to Princeton students, the price is the same, and there\u2019s a lot of variation within each option. The newer residential colleges (New College West, Yeh, Whitman, Butler) are overall nicer than most upperclass housing, while the older ones (Rocky, Mathey, Forbes) are similar. Both have shared kitchens you can get access to, but the details vary by dorm. If I were you, I would go for res college, because your odds of getting a decent room are better imo, but I doubt it will make a big difference.",

I went to several meetings they had to say that was an atrocious idea. Glad they're finally extending it to res colleges, too!",

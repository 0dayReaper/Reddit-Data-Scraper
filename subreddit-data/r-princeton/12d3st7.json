You can hop on a NJTransit shuttle at Newark, that\u2019ll take you to a stop on the NE corridor line, from then it\u2019s just a half dozen stops South to Princeton Junction, from there you take a second shuttle to Princeton, the stop is at the campus.\n\nYou can do something similar at Philly, but you need to take SEPTA from the airport to Temple university, then take the SEPTA Trenton line to Trenton, from there you\u2019d transfer to the NJTrsnsit NE corridor line, Princeton junction is the second stop from here. Then you take the shuttle to campus. \n\nAll the shuttles mentioned above are trains (monorails) not buses.",

It\u2019s roughly 45 mins from Newark, maybe a little more from Philadelphia, but Philadelphia will be more painful. You could always try Trenton airport (TTN), but it\u2019s much smaller and a lot fewer options in terms of flights. Maybe like 15-20 minutes by Uber to the University. Finally, there is an actual airport in Princeton (39N) but it\u2019s practically not an option as airliners don\u2019t operate out of it (think tiny Cessnas).",

Maybe you can find another incoming first-year to split the fare. \nThere are other options: \nIf you live along the NE coastline then look into Amtrak to Trenton. Uber from Trenton. Amtrak does stop at Princeton Junction 2 or 3 times a day. Those are locals though. \nTrenton has an airport and sometimes has great deals but limited destinations.\nShip your stuff, fly to Newark with less luggage, and take NJT to Princeton.",

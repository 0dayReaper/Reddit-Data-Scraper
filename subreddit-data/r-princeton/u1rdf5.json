I heard that EGR is generally taught better (that regular intro classes are often taught by grads), and that the course load is more reasonable. I\u2019m looking for some insight from former students on which sequence you recommend! Any advice would be much appreciated :)",

            "comment": "Question 1: what is your level of math preparation? EGR152/154 are equivalent to Calculus 2 and Linear Algebra, and EGR156 (which you take sophomore fall) is multivariable calc. EGR152 (I took it last fall) was extremely well taught and definitely taught applications beyond\u2014our first two weeks were spent discussing Fourier series as a way to practice integration by parts. Some people absolutely loved this (myself included) but be advised that the application questions can be quite difficult on problem sets and usually require a bit of office hours. Definitely one of my favourite classes in the intro sequence though. If you feel like Calculus 2 (Advanced Integration Techniques, Sequences and Series, some light DiffEq\u2019s) will be too remedial, I would recommend taking the MAT sequence instead. Be advised you CAN take EGR physics while taking the math sequence. \n\nPhysics: \nEGR151, taught by Claire Gmachl (head of Whitman College and renowned electrical engineer, she does cool stuff with lasers) is extremely well taught. The goal of the course is to really establish a good understanding of mechanics\u2014it\u2019s definitely workload intensive no matter your background because of the problem sets. On average, they took 8 hours a week, and most weeks I\u2019d spend about 2-3 hours in her office hours, which were held almost every night and on Sundays/thursdays for multiple hours at a time. Collaboration is allowed and encouraged, so getting a good study group together is great. Midterm and final were both take-home and reminiscent of the problem sets. \n\n\nTake a look at the course reviews when you get your NetID. Also, test out of gen Chem if you can. Don\u2019t sweat course selection right now!",

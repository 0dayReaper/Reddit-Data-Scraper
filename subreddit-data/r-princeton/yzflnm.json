People are definitely passionate and willing to take a stand on these types of things, but most, save for a few people from a certain type of wealthy background, want to take a more traditional career path, oftentimes in your typical areas like tech, finance, and consulting.",

That's just a general thing they're into though. They also really like people who are very well rounded and can demonstrate competency and impact in seemingly disparate areas like music and computer science for example. Also it's super important to them that you have good social skills and are likeable, kind, and outgoing while also being very driven, hardworking, and ambitious.\n\nAt the end of the day though, not everyone here fits into these categories and has these specific abilities, as the student body is very diverse. This is just a rough picture of certain things I have observed as being common here.",

EVERY student will \u201cpersonally contribute\u201d to scholarship at some point in their time here and I believe that the school subtly looks for this independence/persistence/tenacity inside each application.\n\nSo, in short, be driven and dedicated to something by demonstrating independence within that field.",

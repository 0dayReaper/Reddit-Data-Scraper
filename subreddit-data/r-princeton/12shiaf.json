    "postText": "Howdy Tigers,\n           I have a quick question about housing between senior move-out and the start of summer housing in the New Colleges. Summer housing does not start until June 4th, but Senior Move-out occurs the end of May, post-commencement. Does anybody know if I can remain on campus for those ~5 days between reunions and summer housing start, and how I would go about doing that? I ask for my own convenience, as packing my shit up for just 5 days before I move back in again seems silly. \nAlso, I need to store stuff over the month of August only - are any small storage units usually free that at that time of year? I am a first year, so I have no clue what to expect. Thanks!",

Engage in precepts, ask questions, do extra-curriculars you are passionate about and get invested in. Spend time talking with seniors about job application process, talk to alum about careers, think about what you want to do and take advantage of opportunities at Princeton to explore new areas, try new things, and challenge yourself.\n\nAlso, McGrath study help is good too. And the writing center. :)",

            "comment": "I'm not sure how true this is necessarily across all fields (I'm a grad student in QCB, so just my observation of undergrads doing the QCB certificate mainly), but:\n\nUndergrads here seem to take way too hard of classes. There was a physics sophomore in my 500-level biophysics class, they did fine but I'm sure it necessitated lots of additional work from them; the class had an expectation of around a university senior-level understanding of physical chemistry and applied math. I'm not sure if this is encouraged by their academic advisors/the school, if they're used to excelling academically so they bite off more than they can chew, or if they're just generally ambitious. It's good to challenge yourself, but do realize that challenging yourself comes with this struggle. Part of \"maintaining balance\" in academia is balancing really pushing yourself vs doing things that you're comfortable with, in my opinion.",

I was nervous about making the transition to university academics when I first started undergrad, so I purposely chose not to skip too far ahead in a couple gen eds for my first semester. It was still an adjustment to the faster pace, less guidance, etc., so I really appreciated being able to start in courses where I had solid baseline knowledge.\n\nI'd also recommend trying to have at least 1 \"for fun\" class every semester. Won't always be possible, but something like an art class or a seminar where you don't have to worry about grades and can just enjoy the material is invaluable.",

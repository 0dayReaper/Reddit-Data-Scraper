    "postText": "For far too long, Princeton University's Class Day has hosted a steady stream of academics, actors, politicians, and other people. We claim to attend an elite university, but no university can be truly inspiring, illuminating, and thought-provoking when it invites a riff-raff of normie Class Day speakers.\n\nThe previous years we've had actress Ellie Kemper, senator Cory Booker, director Baz Luhrmann, and novelist Jodi Picoult; however, none of these speakers' accomplishments are comparable to the magnificent Snoop Dogg (aka Snoop Lion).\n\nSnoop Dogg is an iconic rapper who has changed the culture of the hip hop throughout his dynamic career. Being nominated for over 17 Grammy's (should've won 17...), selling over 35 million albums worldwide, and making hits like \"Drop It Like It's Hot\" makes Snoop Dogg more than qualified to deliver a brilliant and evocative speech to the Princeton community. Snoop Dogg's experiences are so unique that he even set the Guinness World Record for the largest paradise cocktail. Now that's a man that Princeton needs to learn from.\n\nBe the change you want to see in the world and sign and support this petition. The voices and opinions of the Princeton undergraduate need to be heard.\n\nTL;DR: Vote Snoop Dogg for Princeton's Class Speaker (sign the petition and like the FB page)\n\nLink: [http://chng.it/ZjwqdFqJ2G](http://chng.it/ZjwqdFqJ2G)\n\nLink: fb.me/snoopdoggspeaker",

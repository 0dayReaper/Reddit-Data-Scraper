            "comment": "Well, if you live in the Graduate College (many/most first-year PhDs do, besides those bringing partners/families), you're required to be on a meal plan. That said, the dining halls are decent, but even on the cheapest meal plan you aren't likely to get your money's worth: swipes don't roll over between semesters, and a la carte swipes are actually cheaper than meal plan for anything besides dinner. Also, to use all of the swipes I think you literally need to average 1 swipe a day every single day of the semester, weekends and mid-semester breaks included.",

The other grad housing is townhouse and apartment-style so you can cook for yourself, while the GC is more of a traditional dorm with very few communal kitchens. (I think maybe just 2 for the whole dorm.) \n\n[Procter Hall](https://dining.princeton.edu/where-eat/graduate-college) is the dining hall attached to the Old Graduate College.\n\nAnd re: your other questions, yes you can swipe for any meal you want at any dining hall (so including the undergrad ones), up to 105 times per semester on the lower plan and an unlimited number of times on the more expensive plan. Procter is open for dinner Mon-Thurs, plus Sunday brunch. The undergrad halls do breakfast/lunch/dinner Mon-Fri and brunch/dinner Sat/Sun.",

It's a good way to get to know people and make friends across the different fields. Agreed though that if you live in apartment type housing, you will not want to be on a meal plan. By the way, another reason to opt for the GC is that it's closer to academic buildings on campus. (I guess it may depend on your field and office location concerning Lakeside, but certainly closer than Lawrence.)",

They always indicate the presence of common allergens, there\u2019s good variety and there are many dining halls, so you can pick your favorite or the closest to where you are.\n\nWhen you move to the apartment on campus, it might become a little inconvenient to walk there from home, but I have a roommate who does it and seems content about it. One of the new residential colleges is fairly close to our Lakeside apartment (about 10 min walk, maybe less). \n\nI personally don\u2019t have a meal plan. Most days last year I had to go to lunch a little past noon and the dining halls near the dept were too crowded, so I preferred to either bring my own food or grab something around Nassau Street. These days I also have a lot of lunch seminars, so lots of free food :) \n\nYou should check the Campus Dining website for more details and the meal plans, but yes, they serve breakfast, lunch, dinner. Except on weekends, then it\u2019s brunch and dinner.",

Keep in mind though that the hours are a little schizophrenic, it's not open for Friday dinner weirdly, and it's never open for lunch (though usually you'll be on campus). You can eat at any of the other dining halls, which usually have at least one hall with good food, you can check the menus online at [tigermenus](https://tigermenus.herokuapp.com/). \n\nAs an aside, I think my personal favorite meal is Sunday Brunch at Forbes, although it does compete with Grad College Sunday Brunch (which sometimes is even better).",

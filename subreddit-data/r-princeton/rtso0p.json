    "postText": "Hi, so class of 2026 here. I know Yale has a program where they give low-income students unfamiliar with cold weather a stipend of money for winter clothes (Winter Clothing Grants). If I show this to Princeton's financial aid office, do you think they would match it? I have heard the fin aid office is more  open and chill than most other colleges. From my research, some residential colleges give students spare winter coats so hopefully they are open to spending that beefy endowment for a full-fledged Winter Clothing Program.",

If you just point out some other school has a certain benefit, the incentive to try to match it for you (if they don't already do it anyway themselves) is that not doing so could mean you might otherwise go there.\n\nBy the way, if the financial aid office is genuinely chill then maybe that means they prefer not using winter clothes. :)",

Although Princeton covered the vast majority of my tuition and fees, I still had to take out some loans for living expenses, etc. I was grateful for the aid they did give and for the opportunity to go to a school like Princeton. If you need to take out a few grand in loans to cover incidentals, so be it. That\u2019s not a lot of money (especially if you end up going into banking, tech, or consulting), and it\u2019s not unfair to ask students to bear some portion of their schooling costs. Also, Princeton is not as cold as New England, so you don\u2019t really need a super heavy winter jacket. There are also good low-cost options like Marshall\u2019s on Route 1 or the Greene Street consignment shop on Nassau.",

That\u2019s entitled. You were presumably admitted through early decision and were given a large financial aid package, and yet you want more. And Princeton even has one of the most, if not the most, generous financial aid programs at present and over the past couple decades. That\u2019s not a good look, kid.",

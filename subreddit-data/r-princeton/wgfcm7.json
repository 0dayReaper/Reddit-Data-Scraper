    "postText": "Hello! I am an incoming freshman who is currently planning out my courses for the fall semester. I have fulfilled the language requirement already, but am interested in taking Japanese classes as a beginner. For anyone who has gone through the elementary and intermediate Japanese sequence, did you find it to be worthwhile? How much did your language skills improve?",

            "comment": "I definitely think it's worth it. I went from one only understanding a few random Japanese words to being able to understand kids books and even middle school books very slowly in just 2 semesters. It is A LOT of work though. I ending up having to drop my Japanese class because I couldn't keep up with the vocabulary on top of my degree-related work. I definitely recommend working with an advisor to make a balanced course load so you don't get overwhelmed.",

Considering he was pre-med (with some corresponding science major) and otherwise had no career (he\u2019s a doctor in the US) or personal attachment to Japan, it didn\u2019t seem worth it. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it based on his experience.",

    "postText": "This might be a silly post, but I figure it\u2019s anonymous enough that I will not completely embarrass myself. \n\nI was admitted to the SPIA graduate program.  I\u2019m so happy, but completely shocked. It was a big reach for me. \n\nI\u2019m from a very small town and most of my life I\u2019ve dressed very casually. My dad wore jeans to his wedding type casual.  I\u2019m going to visit the campus soon and am worried about underdressing, but also worried about overcorrecting and overdressing. \n\nHow nicely do the students normally dress? Specifically SPIA, if you happen to know. How nice should one dress for a visit? My *guess* is some nice jeans and a sweater will be fine, but I don\u2019t want be foolish one way or the other. \n\nSigned, completely overwhelmed and still embarrassed despite this (hopefully) anonymous post. \n\n(And thank you!)",

There\u2019s enough\u2026 *uniquely* Dressed people on campus that no one will bother to notice or judge you for what you wear",

He never wore jeans growing up but came home wearing jeans this Spring break. So jeans will be fine there!\n\nMy suggestion is to watch the weather for NJ and choose some high quality pieces that you can layer. There are always kids who never saw snow and moms scrambling to find snow boots and gloves in the Princeton parent group. \n\nHigh quality does not mean high cost. We often shop thrift stores or big late season sales. Our son took one nice wool sweater and he can dress it up with a dress shirt  and slacks or dress it down with jeans and sneakers. Also wool will not smell or need much washing. \nYou will walk a lot on campus. Quality clean comfortable shoes will serve you well. \nChoose what makes you feel good. Space is often limited in general so going with fewer high quality items will serve you well.",

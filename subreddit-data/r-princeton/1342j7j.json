Do most people live in graduate halls, graduate apartment building or private accommodation?\n\nI\u2019ve heard a lot about the dining halls being the center of social life there. Is it difficult to socialize outside of that?\n\nThanks! :)",

            "comment": "Congrats, and welcome to Princeton!\n\nMost first year grad students live in the Graduate College, which is similar to a typical (American) undergrad dorm - little rooms, communal kitchens, at least some level of bathroom sharing. 2nd-3rd years are mostly in Lakeside/Lawrence (on-campus, university-owned apartments), 4th+ mostly off campus. This is supposed to shift once they finish building more on-campus grad housing within the next few years.\n\nBy \"dining halls being the center of social life,\" I assume you mean the eating clubs? While they're a big hub of undergrad social life, only a few take grad students and few grad students are interested in joining (afaik most of the grad members currently are basically 4+1 students completing a masters after graduating Princeton undergrad).\n\nFor grad students - people living in the Grad College will eat in Procter Hall, the dining hall attached to the dorm, but if you aren't in dorm-style housing the dining plan isn't required and most upper years therefore don't go to dining halls. (Though grad students not on dining plans still get 6 free meals per semester in Procter, so you'll see upper years on occasion.)\n\nThere's DBar, a small bar in the Grad College basement, and people will go to the couple of bars that are in town. While living on campus is a great way to meet people (most of your cohort will likely be in GC, though that varies by program), you can definitely live elsewhere and still be social.",

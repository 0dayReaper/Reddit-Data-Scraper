OP asked a super reasonable question about academic rigor at an undergraduate-focused institution.\n\nOP, there\u2019ll be a lot of assholes and peers who seem to have been studying things like neuroscience since they were 13. My advice is to *ask for help*. Work with other students. Talk to professors. Identify the professors who are on your side and don\u2019t bother with the others. It\u2019s easy in an environment like Princeton to think everyone\u2019s figuring it out on their own, but everyone leans on others. Identify your allies and don\u2019t give up!",

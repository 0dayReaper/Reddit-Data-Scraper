Or that it can solve local housing insecurity by donating land to the town for social housing. Or that UHS doesn't cover a lot of mental health services or gender affirmation. Or that the Math department has a particularly bad reputation with undergraduates. And a large portion of Princeton ends up in consulting or finance instead of serving humanity as the motto would suggest.\n\nIt's pretty difficult to get the university to do much of anything because it's such an undemocratic institution. To be fair though, many of these are common problems with the Ivy League. But some comparable universities are better on divesting and dissociating from fossil fuels and with making math accessible.\n\nAt the same time, I would say it's a great place for most subjects and it has significantly more resources per student than any other university. Because of the latter, financial aid is becoming much better than any other (no tuition, room, board costs, plus an annual stipend of $4,050 starting the next school year if your family makes $100,000 or less; and still great aid for those above). I think the clubs are pretty diverse but if there are extracurricular activities missing, you can be the change and start a student group.",

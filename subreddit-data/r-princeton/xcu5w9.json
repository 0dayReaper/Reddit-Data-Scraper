    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI am a recent graduate from the university and fortunately have a good, stable job (of the S.T.E.M. variety). When I talk about my time at Princeton, I sometimes feel like people look down on my degree and I feel the imposter syndrome coming back. I have the literally degree, the evidence, in my hands. And I try to remind myself that \u201cyes, I (+AI\u2019s, Professors, and countless friends) made it, the hard work paid off\u201d.  The imposter syndrome-like thoughts creep in when I have to explain I was remote for a year, and that I had a good amount of scholarship(s). People are quick to latch onto these facts and they quickly say \u201cah! Okay. They just wanted the money\u201d or \u201cyou didn\u2019t go in-person? I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone that\u201d. I worked so hard and accomplished my goals, how does scholarship or not existing there in-person undermine my degree? I played the hand dealt to me. For a majority of the time I\u2019m happy with my choice to obtain my degree, even if I completed it fully remote. However, it\u2019s nights like these where my heart becomes heavy and I end up going over school material to find affirmation in the abilities I gained from being a Princeton student. While writing, I feel better getting this off of my chest and I don\u2019t feel inclined to review more Stat. Thermo. If there are other people like me out there, just know you are enough and you are awesome.",

            "comment": "Look down on your degree? Those people are nuts or doing that to try to make you feel bad. The reality is that no one in their right mind would look down on a degree from Princeton.\n\nLots of people got scholarships to attend Princeton, myself included, and that\u2019s one of the great things about alma mater. They\u2019re facilitating the best and brightest to going there and making it so that funding isn\u2019t an issue. You belonged there and you belong in the alumni community.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to be remote for a time because you missed out on precious time at the best old place of all. It is what it is. Doesn\u2019t make you any less of a member of the alumni community. Heck, I spent a semester abroad literally across the ocean and taking no Princeton classes. This is a dumb argument.\n\nKeep your head up, doubting yourself is normal, but you deserve what you\u2019ve got.",

People I know who *actually* look down on me for my undergrad degree are falsely humble and condescendingly nice about it. \n\nIf I tell people where I go to grad school they're much more likely to be confrontational and criticize it, which literally never happens for my undergrad.",

Seems like you\u2019re surrounded by the wrong people. Princeton is no MIT or cmu, but it\u2019s a great school. Be proud to those assholes",

An Intel core i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 would be good too, but you would probably be fine with an i5 or Ryzen 5. It really more depends on if you will use the laptop for anything high resource tasks outside of coursework such as gaming or video editing. In that case you might want something with a dedicated gpu",

            "comment": "Everyone\u2019s saying \u201cGET A MAC!\u201d but it really depends on what you\u2019re using it for. TLDR: If you\u2019re an average student, get a mac (with caveats). If you\u2019re gonna do advanced STEM, go Windows. \n\nIf you want to do software engineering or general note taking, Macs are for sure amazing. By far the best computer for coding and note taking that I\u2019ve tried. But if you want to do advanced CAD work or any type of 3D/circuit modeling, macs do have a limit on what they can do. Get a good workhorse like the Thinkpad X1 or the Razer Blade. If you even THINK you might want to explore finance though, you\u2019re going to need a windows laptop. Excel famously sucks on Macs, (shortcuts are nearly unusable), so you\u2019re stuck with the windows options. Anything that requires extensive system configuration too: go Windows. Of course I guess you could always partition a Mac drive and set up either windows or linux on the same machine, but it\u2019s just easier to have one or the other from the get go.\n\nHere\u2019s my general spec recommendations (with a bit of futureproofing in mind):\n\nCPU: At least Ryzen 5 5600 or Intel i5-13th gen;\n\nRAM: At least 16GB DDR4;\n\nGPU: Any, but at least a GTX 1660 preferred;\n\nMemory: 500GB - 1TB SSD;\n\nPorts: 1+ USB-C, HDMI slot, headphone port;\n\nThere\u2019s some usable laptops in the $500-$1000 range, but you\u2019d ideally be spending in the $1,000-$2,500 range for a good, long-lasting laptop. My personal recommendations in each OS category are the new Macbook 14 (any configuration) and the Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 11. If you have a couple scholarships and you\u2019re on financial aid, the university has a computer purchase program that MIGHT be able to reimburse you. Best of luck laptop shopping!",

If you like windows though and want a solid laptop with good GPU specs for gaming and more graphics intensive software i highly highly recommend an ASUS ROG Zephyrus. One of the best gaming laptops. A little on the pricier side, but you can get one for around $1k or less if you wait for sales (July 4 etc). If you don\u2019t care about GPU, a standard dell xps or other well known windows brand will be fine",

    "postText": "Hi there! Like many people on this sub currently, I\u2019m a prospective prefrosh heavily leaning towards Princeton. I tried searching up posts related to Princeton\u2019s ECE program, but for some reason couldn\u2019t find any. I would really appreciate it if a current ECE could tell me about their experience combining ECE w a liberal arts\u2122\ufe0f education. It would also be helpful if someone could address a few of these questions:\n\n1. How is the support system in Princeton\u2019s ECE department? I know engineering is going to be difficult anywhere, but how have peers/professors/advisors made things easier?\n2. Do you think it\u2019s possible to have enough time to deeply pursue research outside of the classroom? 3. More generally, I\u2019ve heard princeton is academically oriented and it is a major concern of mine. Are many students able to achieve a good work-life balance?\n4. Where do Princeton ECE majors tend to end up after graduation?",

Anyway, I\u2019m not an ECE major, but my friends who are seem to be pretty happy overall with it. Princeton requires ECE students to complete a senior thesis, so you\u2019ll definitely be able to deeply pursue research outside the classroom - it\u2019s a requirement.",

            "comment": "Hello\u2026 current senior in the department here :). First off the ECE department is very supportive and quite tight knit. There\u2019s lots of classes you take together and the profs mostly all have an open door policy. ECE especially encourages independent research which you can start your sophomore year (just talk to a prof and join their lab\u2014as long as they have room most will take you). The work-life balance is a hard question because it\u2019s something that you have to learn what works for you but I always make time for events and friends. It\u2019s a leavening curve for everyone though. Lastly, alumni end up everywhere from hardware design at NVidia, Microsoft etc to software at Google to robotics\u2026 you get my point. There are a ton of connections and faculty frequently send out internship and research opportunities to the listservs from their contacts.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm a graduate student at another institution and will be visiting IAS Princeton in Fall 2022. For this reason, I need to find housing and unfortunately, IAS is unable to provide one of their on campus housing options. It seems to me that the best option for me would be to find someone who wants to sublet a room in their apartment in the Fall 2022 semester. Is there any website/ facebook group where I could find such listings? If anyone looking at this post is looking to sublet, then feel free to directly contact me!",

Will be applying to Stanford MIT and Princeton regular and will be choosing the school mainly based on financial aid. \n\nOur post tax is only around 100k and the 70k sticker price is really not affordable for us with all the siblings I have. Does anyone know which school usually gives the best financial aid to students with my parents\u2019 income? Waiting until April is stressing me out :(",

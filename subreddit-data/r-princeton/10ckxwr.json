You\u2019d have to like make the case that having a roommate would endanger your health or that you have X condition which requires privacy to treat or something like that. They are flexible but it has to be like real?\n\n\nSorry if you have something serious and are just questioning and I\u2019m being a jerk, it just kind of sounds like you\u2019re wondering if you can use it as a work around - which I get lol but it\u2019s unlikely! \n\nAlso roommates aren\u2019t bad! Good way to meet people lol",

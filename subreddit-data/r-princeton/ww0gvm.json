    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\n\nIm a guy from Spain and I am going to ask marriage to my girlfriend soon (October most probably). Im preparing a gift with the help of people from all around the world. \n\nPeople are sending me pics of a paper with this text in spanish: \"El amor que Edu siente por Bea es tan fuerte que llega a [City/town name]\" (which means \"The love Edu feels for Bea is so strong that reaches [city/town name])\", and a part of the City in the background of the pic. \n\nThis is an example of a pic I got from Chicago a few weeks ago:\n\nhttps://ibb.co/CsnYrfs\n\nIm trying not only to get city pics, but some of the most iconic scenarios or spots of her favourite series and movies. (I already got some pics from Stranger Things spots which you can see in my other thread).\n\nNow Im trying to get a pic from a spot of another of her favourite series: House. I found that outside scenes of fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital were filmed at Princeton Frist Campus Center:\n\nhttps://ibb.co/b6xYCTy\n\nI would be so grateful if you could help me sending me a pic with the text (\"El amor que Edu siente por Bea es tan fuerte que llega a Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital\") from that spot\n\nI want to really thank u all in advance. Greetings from Spain!",

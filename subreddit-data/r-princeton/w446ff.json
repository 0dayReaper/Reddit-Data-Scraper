    "postText": "Hey everyone! Sorry in advance if this has already been asked before, but do any current/past students know the format (MC/FRQ distribution and # of q) and content (outside of AP chem and AP Physics C) of the chem and physics (103 and 104) placement tests? Also, if you found some websites/material useful for the test, what helped? What didn\u2019t? Thanks a lot!",

            "comment": "I don't remember fully, but I'm pretty sure the physics placement was almost all free response (don't remember how many questions though). Chemistry placement was almost all multiple choice (again don't remember exactly though). I personally just used my notes from high school and general AP review material. \n\nFor some perspective, I got a 70% on the chemistry placement and fully placed out. One of my friends got like a 60% and placed out as well. Physics might be a bit more strict I think though.",

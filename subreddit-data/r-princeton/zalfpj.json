    "postText": "I applied REA to Princeton and got an email on November 2nd telling me I should expect a call or email from an alumni interviewer. In that same email, I got mybl supposed interviewer's name and email address.\n\nIt's been 29 days and I haven't gotten anything from her. Should I reach out or not? The email says she'd be contacting me, but I haven't heard anything from her in almost a month.\n\nThanks!",

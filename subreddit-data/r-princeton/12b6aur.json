    "postText": "I am sure this information is somewhere out there but I am a bit confused on how applying for BSE and AB works. If you are going into a specific major like computer science or electrical/computer engineering, do you need to apply to a certain degree. Is one more competitive than the other when applying into the school? How does it work? Any information on this would be greatly appreciated!",

I saw that 3/4 of undergrads are AB candidates. Is that just because there are more majors or because its easier to get in through AB?",

For the past few years, COS has been the largest major and they might be trying to cut back on that. This isn\u2019t 100% confirmed, but just something to think about. You can always switch into COS after you\u2019re accepted tho.",

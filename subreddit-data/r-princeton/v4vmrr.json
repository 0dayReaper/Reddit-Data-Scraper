    "postText": "Has anyone taken EGR 491: High-Tech Entrepreneurship? What is the course structure? What did you like about the course? What did you dislike? Are there any other Entrepreneurship courses you would recommend?\n\nI personally have some tech startup ideas but am not sure how to judge market fit (or if they are viable ideas), and I'm also not sure how to build a team and raise funding. It seems like I would need funding even before building a prototype and I'm not sure if VC's give funding for just an idea.",

It\u2019s mostly discussion-style, and it\u2019s expected that you are prepared and contribute. The material is super interesting too",

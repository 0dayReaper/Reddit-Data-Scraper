Jk that's like all ivies and probably most colleges. \n\nMore seriously, I don't think there are any experiences or skills that you uniquely gain from going to Princeton. I think you can get them at any top 15 school if you work hard enough and seek out connections and experiences. Financial aid at Princeton is fantastic, but I don't think there are any experiences/skills you couldn't get at another elite school.",

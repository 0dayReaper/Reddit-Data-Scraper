It really only matters in the first two weeks of the fall semester and last two weeks of the spring semester. If you are talking about other buildings like classrooms and lecture halls, there\u2019s typically AC.",

Take challenges as they come, especially if you have no control over them (ie. the heating/ac). It's good to plan ahead, but a lot of the issues you're asking about, you also have no control over",

            "comment": "From personal experience (\ud83d\ude02), Princeton professors are not interested in working with high schoolers.\n\nYou could always email professors whose work you find interesting, but expect either no response or a polite rejection.\n\nPrinceton does have a journalism summer program, and there\u2019s a half-affiliated math program, though they are both selective (and I am sure there are more programs if you search).\n\nThe university has a program where high schoolers can take classes at the university, but it is limited only to local schools (and even at those schools, the program is very restrictive).\n\nMy answer might be a bit disheartening, but you could always look for opportunities at local schools that are less selective than Princeton (community colleges, possibly state schools). You\u2019ll have a much better chance of having the opportunity to do work there.",

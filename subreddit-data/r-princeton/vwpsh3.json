    "postText": "Hello, I am part of the Class of 2026 planning on doing computer science through BSE. That said, I am wondering about the difficulty of PHYS 103/104 and how hard it is to place out of it (I don't want to do physics at all in college if possible). \n\n* Physics C in HS but teacher was new to mechanics so didn't learn anything. E&amp;M was a bit better but still real rough for me.\n* Took Calc BC as a junior but basically flushed a lot of it as I was not able to do multi/linear senior year",

            "comment": "Not sure if this is true for physics, but I placed out of chemistry with a 70% on the placement test. I have friends who got a 60% on the placement and placed out of chemistry as well. Just putting it out there for reference.\n\nIf you end up taking it, PHY 103 will be okay. I found that all the content up until the last couple weeks to be pretty much the same as AP Physics C. However, the problems you are expected to solve will be a bit harder than in high school. PHY 104 is def harder than 103. The professors made it a bit easier halfway thru the semester because a lot of students didn't like it, but idk if they'll keep the changes for Spring '23. Calc shouldn't really be a problem for those classes. I don't think I used much BC knowledge, just mostly integrals, derivatives, and solving \"simple\" differential equations.",

It certainly works for some people, but for most it happens that Princeton courses move so quickly that you\u2019ll cover most of the material you\u2019ve self-studied within the first few weeks of the semester, and in much greater detail, so it largely ends up being a waste of time. I recommend you take this time to relax while you\u2019re on break! That said, if you really want to study some physics ahead of time, I recommend Tipler and Mosca. It will cover most topics from 103 and 104 but with practice problems whose difficulty is much less than 103 and 104 problems \u2014 just keep that in mind. Best of luck!",

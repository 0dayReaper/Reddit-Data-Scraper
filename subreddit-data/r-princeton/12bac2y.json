Even if they aren\u2019t your forever friends, it\u2019s great to know a few folks that week.\n\nMake sure to participate in the orientation / zee group activities. Don\u2019t be afraid to join folks at lunch or brunch or dinner that you\u2019ve met once.\n\nGo to the activities fair and join a few clubs!\n\nEveryone is also nervous and looking to make friends. Just lean into the opportunities to do so and you\u2019ll meet some folks you like one way or another, I think!",

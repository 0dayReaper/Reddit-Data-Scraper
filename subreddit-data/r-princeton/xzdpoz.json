    "postText": "Hey everyone, i am an international applicant and want to apply for fall semester 2023. As an international applicant i need to provide proficiency in English. So i was wondering which to take TOEFL or IELTS. TOEFL offers only online exams and iBT exams which princeton doesn't accept. So i was wondering is it acceptable to take TOEFL Essentials from home or a paper based IELTS? And what should my minimum score be?",

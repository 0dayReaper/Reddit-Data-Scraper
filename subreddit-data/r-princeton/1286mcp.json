    "postText": "So I have the absolute privilege of getting into Princeton, Stanford, Duke and Johns Hopkins in the past 24 hours. I\u2019m now deciding between Princeton and Stanford and I\u2019m torn.\n\nBasic info: cost is bascially the same because of scholarships. I\u2019m from the UK so east coast is cheaper to fly. \n\nCAREER/ACADEMICS: I applied as a polticial science/public policy/econ major. I hope to go into work related to economics, finance or public policy kind of stuff. I\u2019ve heard east coast is the best for this, especially Princeton because it\u2019s close to NY and relatively close to DC (compared to Stanford lol). I haven\u2019t yet done my similar level of research on Stanford but Princeton\u2019s SPIA (School of Public and International Affairs) is one of the best if not the best in the world, which seems very exciting. I\u2019m also interested in the intersection of public policy and AI which Princeton is doing research on that I\u2019m intrigued by.\n\n*So career and academic wise it seems to currently makes better sense to go to Princeton \u2014 Although both schools have fantastic international reputations*\n\nStudent life:\n\nI\u2019ve spent so much time watching Stanford vlogs \u2014 the life there and the campus seems like heaven. Of course Stanford isn\u2019t without its flaws (Stanford bubble) but it does seem incredible + I\u2019d love to cycle/electric skateboard to class! Stanford new neighbourhood system seems cool as well though I don\u2019t know enough about it to comment. \n\nPrinceton, I know everything abt this school from Justin and Nicholas Chae vlogs. Princeton campus is EPIC for its old school architecture. I also really like the residential college system for the first 2 years. Potential negatives are the tough academics (apparently there\u2019s grade deflation???) and the fact that the fencing team are way beyond my level. I could potential join Princeton as a walk on athlete but still unlikely. Whereas with Stanford (also Division 1), I\u2019d have a bit better chance of getting on the team. I\u2019m a fencer for my national team btw but Americans are insane at fencing.\n\n\nMajor questions and final remarks:\n\nFor my academics and career path, am I correct in thinking Princeton is better? \n\nUsing your anecdotes, how would you compare the student life of either school?\n\nMy mom says that since Princeton doesn\u2019t have a business or law school that I should go to Princeton because I won\u2019t get the chance to go there otherwise. Whereas she says that Stanford will always be there for MBA/law. Basically if I want both schools I should go to Princeton for college and possibly Stanford after. \n\nPlease could any of y\u2019all help me decide (especially those ppl who have gone/ are at either school though all help is still appreciated)?!!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m currently attending Stanford as a graduate student and attended Princeton as an undergrad. I\u2019ll give you some general observations I\u2019ve made, first off:\n\n-It is completely true that you will get more facetime with professors at Princeton than at Stanford - even as a graduate student at Stanford I have keenly felt the lack of professor accessibility, which I have never experienced at Princeton. \n\n-Princeton absolutely cares much more deeply for its undergrads than its grad students, and I honestly think gives much more resources to its undergrads than most similar institutions\n\n-Stanford weather and campus atmosphere is definitely way nicer; as someone with seasonal depression, being on the west coast (particularly in the Bay) has relieved so much stress and anxiety. I also get more openly depressed vibes from Princeton students vs. Stanford students - this might just be because of the prevalent paddling duck syndrome at Stanford though, I feel like generally when Princeton students are unhappy they are just openly unhappy and Stanford students kind of hide it a bit more, I chalk this up entirely to weather lmao \n\n-That being said, Princeton architecture is way nicer, the campus feels way more intimate, and the study spaces (imo) especially for those in humanities and social sciences are way nicer. You definitely feel like you\u2019re in the halls of some hallowed institution, rather than enveloped in some architectural mistake made in the 50s \n\n-Stanford\u2019s libraries and study areas get crowded way more easily than Princeton; Princeton just has way fewer people consuming resources relative to the facilities they have and I\u2019ve never fought for study spaces in Firestone or any academic buildings even in peak finals season while I\u2019m constantly circling around looking for open spots to study at Stanford when peak season rolls around\n\n-It is true that grades are generally higher at Stanford; it\u2019s different for me because I went from undergrad to grad so the programs aren\u2019t that comparable but at Stanford I am getting higher grades for palpably less effort on my part. We may not have grade deflation at Princeton anymore, but we don\u2019t have Stanford\u2019s grade inflation. That said, most grad programs you\u2019ll apply to with a Princeton degree seem to be aware of this and take it into consideration, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a huge problem unless you\u2019re pre-med or something\n\nIn the end, I feel like undergrad at Princeton, grad at Stanford is absolutely the way to go. The undergrad focus at Princeton is unbeatable at any other institution of similar caliber. \n\nEspecially if you are interested in SPIA, I really really really think you should choose Princeton. I am an engineer myself so maybe the people I\u2019ve interacted with at Stanford are a skewed population, but I\u2019ve definitely gotten an extremely entrepreneurial, tech focused vibe from Stanford that relegates other subjects to lower positions. Culturally, if it means anything to you, it seems widely thought at Stanford among undergrads that some majors are way easier than others (ie STEM folks looking down on non STEM) while at Princeton there is more of a general consensus that all majors are valued and equally difficult (these I have gleaned from several posts on anonymous student talk platforms at each respective school, so take with a grain of salt). \n\nTl;dr highly recommend Princeton for your interests, read all else if you\u2019d like! \n\nFinally, huge congratulations for your accomplishments! You can\u2019t make a bad choice here, so don\u2019t sweat it and enjoy~",

I\u2019m also in SPIA so feel free to PM me but the current program is a bit flawed\u2026that said, it is getting better for your incoming class. Also student life at Princeton does tend to revolve around knowing upperclassmen and being part of sports teams or other similarly close knit groups or having connections like going to the same elite private high school etc. This does mean that social life can VERY social climb-ey and friendships can feel very superficial, which is something I\u2019ve heard a lot from this class of freshman and sophs.",

I\u2019m procrastinating on my thesis lol. \n\nSo tbh you could see it on the SPIA website but basically they make us in our junior year take classes that don\u2019t actually count for course credit so it just ends up being another class load and you don\u2019t even get credit for it and you had to write two junior papers (JPs) during your junior year and then senior year we have one of the longest theses to write. People got mad and they finally changed it for the class of 2025 and on, I\u2019m not sure what the new reqs are. \n\nAlso SPIA\u2019s study abroad opportunities compared to other Princeton majors suck. It\u2019s literally only Cambridge and no unis in other European countries or other continents, which I feel like is a big drawback especially given their whole desire for SPIA students to learn a language and be multilingual. My friend rn is studying abroad in Milan for Econ and I\u2019m jealous haha. \n\nAdditionally regarding residential colleges: the system that we have is what you make it. Basically you have your zee group and can be friends w them and rely on ur RCA for like guidance and stuff but on the total flip side you can not go to zee group events and totally disregard your zee group. For a lot of people, their res college is where they live and eat some of their meals and that\u2019s pretty much it. Princeton really tries to push the whole res college community thing but it only, in my experience, applied to one of our res colleges (Forbes) because it was the furthest out and people are too lazy to leave and walk up campus lol thus creating ~community~. I\u2019ve heard for Yale their houses are a lot bigger of a deal. Once you\u2019re a sophomore your res college becomes increasingly meaningless sooo I wouldn\u2019t count that too much into your decision. Also 2 out of the 5 res colleges have air conditioning (and Forbes new addition so I suppose 2.5 of the res colleges) and it gets to like 90 degrees here in the summer and we aren\u2019t allowed to get AC units and the res college you\u2019re in is up to a lottery system. Admittedly the AC thing isn\u2019t the biggest deal but just so you know haha.",

He had the opportunity to teach at Stanford, but stayed in Princeton. The biggest reason he loved Princeton was that it was a university dedicated to teaching undergrads. I believe that is still true. Stanford seems to be dedicating more resources to computer science (I could be wrong, so don\u2019t take my word for it), so do you want to be at an institution heading in a different direction? Princeton also has top-notch econ., I don\u2019t know if you mentioned where you\u2019re from, however, if you\u2019re on the East Coast, the West Coast is much further away, than one can imagine\u2026 yes, famous actors do the bicoastal thing, but that\u2019s because they have tons of money. The  same is true if you are in the West Coast going east. If you live in a warm climate now are you prepared for four seasons or do you prefer four seasons? Would you enjoy the snow or would you be in your element and excelling without a single flake. All this sounds silly but I\u2019m old enough to know geography and climate do play a significant role in one\u2019s happiness. Also, Princeton is doing things to make it easier not to have a car and I don\u2019t know about Stanford. I also don\u2019t know how easy it is to get from Stanford to San Francisco. I do know that the upside of Princeton is that there is a little train station that takes one to a bigger train station that goes to New York, the downside is New Jersey transit. When I was in college Princeton door-to-door to NYC could be done in an hour. Tomorrow I\u2019m going out to Princeton and door-to-door (from my NYC place to my family\u2019s home)it will be close to 2 1/2. Bear in mind, there are no express trains on the weekends.

Just meant that the way course requirements are structured at Stanford you could end up taking relatively few courses from your major and have more classes from other majors",

Like for example, I took a PE class for scuba diving which was incredible (went diving in Monterey Bay and have since gone diving around the world) and took a ton of classes that were completely unrelated to my major but in topics I was interested in. I know recently in the news Stanford has been accused of killing fun with the lame alcohol policy (it\u2019s now more similar to what other schools do), but I still think Stanford is as close you can get to paradise for an undergraduate degree. I would say that Princeton might give you a better textbook education, but Stanford will make you a smarter, more interesting, and more well rounded person which I think is more important end of the day. Just my thoughts, you\u2019ll need to decide yourself what\u2019s best for you. I\u2019ve got biases of my own.",

If you are interested in tech at all (e.g. AI intersections with other topics) then you will notice that Stanford alums tend to dominate.\n\nMy view is that Stanford has a good claim to being the highest-impact college in the world right now, in terms of the academia &lt;&gt; industry conveyor belt that it has for the most impactful fields. Princeton is a great university, but Stanford is playing a totally different game as an institution.",

Better than stanford by far since stanford is on the west coast and just disconnected by distance compared to NYC.\n\nYes stanford has a better tech school/entrepreneurial culture. So i completely agree they create better startups, with proximity to silicon valley. But princeton\u2019s preparation for all levels of finance and econ from grad school to banks to more technical finance is unparalleled. The meta in finance is shifting towards \u2018quantitative\u2019 finance (though i hate that word) which basically means mathematical finance and machine learning esp with high frequency/continuous modelling. The professors at princeton are literally the best at that, the top researchers and knowledgable. Better than stanford 100%, check out princeton\u2019s orfe.",

Is this referring back to the high impact their alums have in tech again? \n\n\nThank you for ur valuable insight!",

One thing to keep in mind though, is that a lot of these bigger clubs are pretty poorly run as my friends and I have found. And with the heavy workload from courses, some people don't even have enough time to put meaningful effort into the activities they want. Don't want to scare you, but just a warning. Of course, it might be different for you so you should still try it out!",

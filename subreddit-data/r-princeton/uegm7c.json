I have not committed yet, and that\u2019s cause I\u2019m stuck between UCLA and Princeton.\n\nAFAIK, UCLA\u2019s aerospace program is slightly better and organized with much stronger clubs, but I don\u2019t really know too much about Princeton.\n\nIn terms of strictly AE, what school should I can choose? Also, what should I know about AE at Princeton?\n\nThanks!",

Especially in a hard engineering field, name recognition (within top tier schools like Princeton and UCLA) is not the most important thing; the aerospace industry cares more about demonstrated experience like project teams and internships. (Also the hyper obsession among new admits with school rankings is not shared with the entire professional industry!) If I were you I would consider cost and also learn about the engineering clubs and project teams at each university, particularly in applications you are interested in working on for a job later. If you want to stay in academia perhaps the Princeton name will serve you well, though. \n\nAlso a lot of Princeton graduates (including engineering graduates) end up in finance and consulting which is disappointing. I think the program has improved since I studied there though and Princeton engineering is expanding with ongoing construction\u2026https://facilities.princeton.edu/projects/es-seas\n\nGood luck with whichever you choose!",

And also to add, people say often that princeton engineering isn't very big on research which is generally a myth, they have the facilities and do encourage independent research, they have a whole senior thesis which would be straight research on whatever you want.   \nI would also recommend interacting with admits at both schools and if you can, visit, because determining whether you like the vibe of a school is going to be a major factor of your happiness there moving forward.\n\nThis is coming from a pre-frosh commit at Pton who is intent on majoring aerospace and who also got a pretty in-depth look at MAE at Pton.\n\nGood luck in whatever decision you make!",

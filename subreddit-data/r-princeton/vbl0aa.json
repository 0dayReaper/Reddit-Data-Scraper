            "comment": "It\u2019s gonna vary quite a bit from student to student but on my end I can say that I love Princeton. Obviously it\u2019s a very rigorous academic setting and everyone I know is quite busy with schoolwork, but you\u2019re surrounded by so many bright, fun, and caring people which imo is easily the most important part of joining any community. The vast majority of my best friends for life I\u2019ve made at Princeton.\n\nIt helps that on the social side of things I think Princeton is actually a pretty damn fun place too. Yes, pretty much everything runs through the eating clubs, and while I think Princeton (like all other colleges) would be a better place without institutions of social exclusion, I also think the clubs are pretty unique in terms of the range of people they attract. I\u2019ve also really enjoyed the fact that the clubs aren\u2019t single sex because it\u2019s allowed me to eat my meals/share a space with more of my friends than if it were single sex. And if you get tired of the clubs, New York and Philly are close by. Finally, the campus is just a beautiful place to live in. \n\nI hope you have a blast if you\u2019re attending Princeton next year. I was on the fence about going and I truly can\u2019t imagine myself anywhere else. It took a while to get settled in because I didn\u2019t know anyone when I moved in, but I wouldn\u2019t worry about that at all. Just like me and everyone else, you\u2019ll find your people. Best of luck to you wherever you go!",

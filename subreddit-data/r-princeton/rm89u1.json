    "postText": "Hey, International student here. Applying to Princeton this Fall. We do not have graded papers or any form of academic papers as part of our curriculum. \n\nSo, I literally have zero clue(actually not zero, I got a little idea) about how to write graded papers and different blogs like college vine or Prepscholar aren't helping that much cz they mainly talk about what things to do in a graded paper but rarely give samples.\n\nIs there anyone here who could (hopefully) give me samples of Academic graded papers (preferably ones that were accepted at Princeton)?\n\nThanks in advance!",

That being said, you can always probably explain in your application your special circumstance (the fact that you don\u2019t do graded papers as part of your curriculum, literally) and do that way. This, of course, would be your plan B to actually writing an SAT-style essay that\u2019s graded by a teacher; find a topic of interest, do some research on pros and cons (or similar), have a clear thesis statement in the first paragraph and defend your thesis via the pros and cons. I\u2019d actually go through multiple iterations of the essay if need be-ask your grader to provide feedback and edit your essay based on that, and submit the final version. Getting an example might be ok, but it will skew your creativity, yet getting someone to actually read it and revising your writing based on their feedback is much better - the skill will be priceless in general, but especially at Princeton. \n\nPS: i doubt you\u2019ll have many ppl volunteering to share their essays with you. No offense, but giving out your intellectual property on an anonymous platform is dubious, and that\u2019s on top of ppl (like myself) being too self-aware to share anything of theirs as an exemplary piece of writing. Good luck there",

I am an international student and the teachers at my school (even the English teachers) are not that well versed to a more modern and professional style of English. Moreover, they are not very cooperative. Like I can't go to them for a second time for the essay grading. It's one and done.  Same goes for the people in my close circle. I'm not that financially solvent to hire professional editors and have to depend mostly on sample ideas to get an understanding of how my writings should be and what they should reflect. \n\nI'm not asking for people's essays or personal papers that they submitted tbh.(Like it would be good but it doesn't necessarily have to be that) I'm just looking for resources like 50 Ivy League Essays or College Essay Guy that have sample academic papers.",

But i think they're not too strict on graded written papers. They just want to gauge like how you fair in a graded assignment so you could write about anything(obviously preferably analysis) but you can even submit like an AP gov homework paper or something random, or an English Coursework",

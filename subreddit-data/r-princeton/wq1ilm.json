You don\u2019t have to talk to them just scan your prox in the scanner on the counter and go in. The workout stuff is down stairs so once you enter the basketball court area make a right down the stairs and follow the signs. The locker rooms and stuff will all be down there. You can also just ask the front desk people for help. There\u2019s no limits on anything as long as you\u2019re a student just make sure to bring your prox",

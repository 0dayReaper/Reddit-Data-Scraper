My MAE friends are often tired of the grind, but they\u2019re overall happy, unlike my friends in CBE (chemical), who all hate their major. Main complaint I hear from MAE friends is that Princeton engineering is sometimes research focused and less applied than they would like (for example, having to self study some content for the professional engineer exam or whatever it\u2019s called, because they hadn\u2019t learned it in the curriculum).",

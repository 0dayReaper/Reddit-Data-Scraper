It\u2019s honestly hard to know until he figured out his schedule, if he has friends he\u2019d rather walk to certain classes with, if his dorm is far from his classes, etc.  As long as you have a good lock it should be fine, and if he doesn\u2019t use you could/should bring home over fall break.",

Also consider that you will have to do some routine maintenance like oiling the chain, but you can get that done for free at the cyclab. About having bikes stolen, if you use any decent lock like a kryptonite u lock then there is little risk of it being stolen. A lot of people seem to use very thin cable locks that could probably be cut with shears.",

There's nothing quite like feeling the wind on your face as you bike down Elm Drive through the heart of campus. (Which your son will be doing quite a lot as it's the way back to Whitman.)\n\nAbsolutely bring it. It's making me miss campus so much just thinking about biking through.",

Just have a good lock in use _always_, even if he leaves it for one minute. Otherwise he will never get his bike back and he'll spam everyone's emails about it.\n\nThe main issue that I have had is that going from south to north is very hilly. I'm fine with it but I wouldn't blame him for getting an electric assisted bike to make it slightly easier. Also, there are few covered areas, so the chain will probably get rusted. Luckily, the Cyclab is very helpful with maintenance.",

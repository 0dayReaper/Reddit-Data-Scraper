They were even sent the results of an investigation by a private investigation firm which was then even posted on the Reddit Bureau of Investigation.\n\nAnother thing -- legally speaking, perhaps they are not required to do anything. They refuse to reveal what process they follow to deal with complaints.\n\nIt sounds like academic institutions don't want to reveal if they have a process to deal with claims of bullying and abuse. Perhaps, they don't have anything. Or maybe they have devised clever ways to avoid taking responsibility. Maybe there is a way to do it within American law.\n\nTheir departments meant to deal with claims of bullying and abuse simply stop replying after one or two emails. (That way, maybe their lawyers have ensured that they don't have to actually do anything.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; touch some grass dude.\n\nI have never heard this term \"touch some grass\", lol. I have got to see if it means what I think it means.",

What happened is that this professor Lee Fleming engaged in bullying behavior thinking that he could not be exposed. These professors even made it a rule that you cannot use cellphones in the classroom (this rule was put in place by Dennis Yao). This was to prevent video evidence of the bullying from emerging. Unfortunately, due to sentiment analysis and other technology, our company was able to analyze even the scant evidence that they left behind. So, it is not that these people were clever. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter all, if they were really clever, they wouldn't have gotten caught.",

SPIA is an excellent school with excellent alumni network.  \n\nI worry about future policy leaders who get a free ride yet take out debt to attend another program.  How will they use taxpayer or donor funds?",

I visited all three campuses and consulted with alumni and current students before ultimately deciding on Columbia SIPA. Since then, I have never regretted my decision.\n\nBased on my experience and testimonials from some colleagues, I highly recommend Columbia SIPA. The curriculum is well-designed with a focus on policy implementation, the campus and its location in New York City provide numerous opportunities for internships and exposure to global policy issues, and the community is welcoming and supportive.\n\nWhile I cannot speak to Princeton's program, I can confidently say that you will enjoy your time at Columbia. I look forward to meeting you this fall when you join Columbia.",

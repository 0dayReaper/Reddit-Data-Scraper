Don\u2019t be intimidated by the first two years of math/physics, the astrophysics classes come junior/senior year and are GREAT so stick it out for the cool stuff to come later!\n2. Try to find summer research work with one of the astrophysics professors after your freshman year\n3. The Astro department is full of odd personalities. Embrace it and get to know the professors and students. Go to the Friday afternoon department meetups even as a freshman and don\u2019t be shy.",

I fell in love with physics in that class even tho it killed my GPA. Also go to office hours and study sessions, as the class is impossible without them. Don\u2019t be afraid to drop down in math if you must to survive in physics, math here is not taught great at all and the goal is mainly to survive until you\u2019re finished than to actually learn anything. The hardest part is getting through freshman year, if you can do that, you can do anything! \n\nAlso, be aware that many Astro classes are only offered EVERY OTHER YEAR, so plan ahead! Unlike other majors, the requirements are plentiful for Astro, so make sure you have a decent idea of when you\u2019re going to take stuff. Talk to other people in the department as much as you can, and ALWAYS have multiple sets of eyes see your schedule to make sure it\u2019s good.\n\nOverall, the classes are overbearing and stressful but the community is full of the nicest, most supportive people you\u2019ll ever meet. Use your resources, and you\u2019ll be fine. Get in touch with Neta Bahcall and Polly Strauss, they would LOVE to talk to you about the department and all of the research and opportunities we have. They\u2019re always happy to see people interested in Astro (our department is very small, so new people are always welcome)! Everyone I\u2019ve talked to is so kind, supportive, and passionate about astrophysics, so get to know them ASAP!!!",

                            "comment": "For reference, I was very unprepared as I went into PHY105 and MAT203 having self-studied both AP Physics C and Calc BC and I was NOT prepared at all. I could have taken PHY103 instead and probably have gotten an A-/B+ without a whole lot of extra effort, as I was very familiar with the content already. I came into PHY105 and struggled greatly in the first half, and got a class-low score on the midterm. I did much better in the second half, and got a C+ overall (I was probably near the bottom of the class with a C in the first half, but doing pretty well with a B-/B in the second half). Had I been using my resources consistently, I probably could have ended the course with a B-, but again I was vastly underprepared (this was my first physics class ever with a teacher that wasn\u2019t the internet), and students who were more prepared than me coming in got grades in the A/A- range. I feel like many freshman STEM classes are just \u201cHow much did your high school prepare you?\u201d, and the amount of effort you put in pushes your grade up/down a notch from that. You can only do so much catching up to get used to Princeton Physics\u2019 pace, so be proud of yourself if you keep up quickly and get an A, but don\u2019t knock yourself down if you are immensely struggling just to get a B. It all evens out by sophomore year for the most part. Plus, nearly everyone suffers in that class anyways, regardless of grade, so you won\u2019t ever feel alone! \n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about grades too much in the first year. Focus on learning and understanding in physics, and you\u2019ll be more prepared for getting a better grade in the next class! (Also just FYI Astro classes are generally easier than the physics classes, so far my Astro classes have been \u201coh yeah I should try extra hard to get that A-, I\u2019m very close!\u201d whereas some physics classes are just a lost cause, but it\u2019s different for everybody and varies generally).\n\nKinda rambly but hope this helps lol, freshman year made me want to drop out and quit everything, so brace yourself!",

There\u2019s a lot of pressure to follow the higher track that\u2019s offered, but as others have said, it all evens out in sophomore year. Yes, PHY105 will give you a bit of a leg up in part of PHY205 sophomore year, but by the time you get to PHY208 in the spring, it\u2019s totally new material for everyone. Additionally, I\u2019ve seen PHY105 turn several people away from physics/astro unfortunately, because of the sheer difficulty; if you can see that happening, just go with PHY103! It\u2019s certainly not worth sacrificing your passion for a topic just for the sake of following a higher track that nobody outside of Princeton will care about.",

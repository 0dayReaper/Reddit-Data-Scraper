    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all, I paid for 2 days of parking on the ParkMobile app for the Princeton junction parking lot, but their website says \u201cDaily parking is offered in the Gravel lot priced at $6 for a single stay of up to 24 hours to a maximum of 14 consecutive days.\u201d\n\nDoes this mean that I can park there for two days consecutively if I pay $12, or do I have to move my car at the end of each 24 hours to make paying for two days work?\n\nThanks!",

    "postText": "I am on a east coast college tour and visited Princeton yesterday. The campus is very nice, but me and my entire party were really surprised by just how bad the grass is. I\u2019ve attached pictures from other schools for comparison.\n\nFeel free to make your own judgement, but Princeton\u2019s grass is extremely patchy and weedy, whereas every other school\u2019s is pristine.\n\nThis can\u2019t be how things normally are, I would think the budget is just too high for it to look like this. If anyone has any insight on this I\u2019m very curious as I can\u2019t find any other mentions of \u201cbad grass at Princeton\u201d on the internet.",

Like I am all for green scenery and all that, but it doesn\u2019t speak towards the academics, the professors, the engagement of the students, or anything else that makes Princeton a top school. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s not as pristine as on other campuses- maybe it\u2019s reunions, or the drought, or something else- but I wouldn\u2019t let it concern you. Most of the year, the grass is going to be frozen and hidden under snow, so it won\u2019t affect your enjoyment much. Plus, I agree with other commenters\u2014 I\u2019d rather Princeton have patchy grass than waste water on it.",

There\u2019s also a ton of construction and weird construction vehicle and foot traffic atm which is contributing. Then as the other commenter mentioned, there\u2019s a drought in NJ atm.",

Even areas that were unaffected by Reunions back in May, which were previously lush and green a few weeks ago, are starting to look rough from the repeat heat emergencies and lack of rain. I agree with the commenters above that said the shitty grass should be a point of pride. Caring about the lush greenness of a campus lawn is gauche as hell. Why would you want to see a university using its money to waste water for aesthetics? That money is better spent fixing the campus in ways that practically help students, not in ways that make it more attractive for aesthetic reasons unrelated to the current environmental reality.",

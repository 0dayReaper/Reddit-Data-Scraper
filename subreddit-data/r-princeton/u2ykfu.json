    "postText": "Hello! I just wanted to hop in and ask for some advice in choosing a school, as I\u2019ve narrowed my choice down to these 5 schools. My parents are willing to cover the costs of any of the schools, but I\u2019m thinking Duke is the obvious choice since the full ride makes it ~$100k cheaper than my next most expensive (Princeton would cost me ~$150k more). My parents also said they\u2019d be happy to give me some of the difference in cost for personal use, which I\u2019d probably invest with.\n\nFor the intangibles, I really like the vibes of Stanford and Duke best, followed by Berkeley, followed by Princeton and Penn. The good weather and school spirit were definitely draws for me at the non ivies. I also don\u2019t care too much about urban vs suburban, as it seems that all the schools have enough to do on campus anyways. Princeton\u2019s campus is so beautiful though and that\u2019s definitely a pro for me! Princeton is also very undergrad focused which is keeping me intrigued!\n\nFor my goals, I hope to enter the startup world after graduating, but I\u2019ve gotten the sense that Princeton and M&amp;T are more finance oriented (please correct me if I\u2019m wrong). Berkeley MET is so new that it\u2019s hard to tell how well it prepares students, whereas I know Stanford is amazing for startups especially with its location and entrepreneurial culture. Duke also seems to be really strong in entrepreneurship (I read that the founders of unicorn startups like Coinbase, Neuralink, Airtable, Plaid, Cameo, etc. were all in the same years at Duke), so should I just pull the trigger for Duke or am I missing something about Princeton?\n\nAlso, I know this is the Princeton sub so I\u2019m expecting some biases, and am posting in multiple places to get different sets of perspectives. Thanks so much!",

Duke has an amazing undergrad spirit because of the basketball teams and healthy cross-town rivalry with UNC. Duke students are very intense and motivated people in general and the instructors were great there. \n\nI get the sense the princeton undergrads like it here but they don\u2019t seem to have the same fanatical spirit the dukies have. \n\nAlso, North Carolina is so so so much more awesome in my personal opinion than central New Jersey. I\u2019m outdoorsy so love things like hiking, beaches, exploring in general. NC was much better for that than Nj. NJ feels kinda isolating tbh\n\nAlso, idk if others in this sub have had this experience, but here at princeton, I\u2019ve found the professors to be much less accessible than the profs at duke. Some of the profs here at princeton seem to have the ivy diva complex. But maybe I\u2019ve just not connected with ones that are down to earth yet\n\nGood luck with your decision!",

The parties are open to the entire student body. So no need to \"have connections\" like at most schools. Really, Stanford's campus size is irrelevant because everybody goes to the same place to socialize. And housing is grouped into \"complexes\", instead of just individual dorms dotted around campus. There is etremely large amounts of school spirit and very little elitism compared to other elite schools. Stanford undergrad is really quite on the same level as Duke.",

My academics were also strong (1550+ SAT, 3.95+ unweighted) and I had some solid leadership at school clubs but I imagine that\u2019s the same for a lot of applicants at these schools. My research has been successful in national competitions and my business received national media coverage, unfortunately both make me very doxxable haha. Hope that helps!",

Of course this answer is very personal but I would go with Duke simply because of the full ride. You like the campus vibe, you know the program is great, and you have an amazing scholarship. I don\u2019t think the other programs are significantly superior to Duke\u2019s for you to abandon this opportunity to graduate without having to pay. Remember that it doesn\u2019t matter what college you go to, the important is what you do in college. Considering what you have already achieved, I honestly think you will be successful in any college that you go to :)",

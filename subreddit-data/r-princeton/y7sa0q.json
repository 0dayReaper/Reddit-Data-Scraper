Some, but there\u2019s something for everyone and even then most clubs aren\u2019t selective or ridiculously hard to get into\n4. This is definitely true, but I don\u2019t think \u201cgetting A\u2019s\u201d matters as much because people know Princeton doesn\u2019t really do grade deflation. Also it makes you work harder which makes you learn more, which I\u2019m a fan of. \n\nI would say that this may not be the place for someone who places \u2018learning\u2019 low on their list for things they enjoy doing. I personally love it here though.",

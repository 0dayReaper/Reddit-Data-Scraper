The fact that a lot of students weren't genuine but fake social climbers also made it worse. Sorry to say, I have never experienced such a terrible, mean group of people before Princeton or since. In retrospect, I now realize how completely out of the ordinary and toxic the social scene was. \n\nSorry to be harsh but I just want to be honest, in case there are any lurkers considering Princeton. Better to know what you are getting into. I had no idea.",

There are assholes everywhere, you have to know how to shun them and forge ahead. \n\nAlso I found Princeton way easier than high school, I liked the food, and I moved back to the area from California because the weather is exactly what I wanted. \n\nTurns out different people like different things.",

Both are same price and distance from home so I wanted to hear about differences between the two schools\u2019 curriculums and social experiences. Any things I should consider regarding which school is harder, better socially, etc? \n\nThank you all :)",

I\u2019m not big on \u201cfrat-like\u201d stuff so I didn\u2019t like that much.\n\nAlso aren\u2019t the junior and senior paper requirements very stressful?",

I was first generation college and my friends were a mix of immigrants and first or second generation college. We made lots of friends in different groups and never felt \u201cless than.\u201d I think a lot of this was because it was all campus focused, where we were (more or less) equal. \n\n2. I bickered and got into an eating club \u2014 but it definitely wasn\u2019t frat-like, haha. Honestly, the friends you make freshman and sophomore year \u2014 you\u2019ll end up likely doing the same as them junior and senior year. So if you make frat-like friends, maybe you\u2019ll end up in TI, a frat-like eating club\u2026 otherwise, odds are low! \n\n3. I don\u2019t think the JP or thesis requirements are super stressful. JP (junior paper) are well supported by professors, so feel more like a normal class paper. A thesis is hard, but you replace class time with it, so you have the capacity to do it - and you have a professor to mentor you through it. I definitely didn\u2019t get an A++ but I did well enough and wasn\u2019t crazy stressed\u2026 and then you get PTL aka post thesis life which is true paradise. \n\nHappy to answer any other questions! Honestly, both schools are amazing so trust your gut and think about the campus, location, etc. good luck!!! xo",

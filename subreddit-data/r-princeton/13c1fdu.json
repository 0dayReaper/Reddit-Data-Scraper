    "postText": "Hi guys, I\u2019m an international IBDP student who is committed to Princeton. My predicted was a 44/45 but after doing the maths and physics exam I\u2019m not sure if I can keep it up. I might end up with 36. Does Princeton rescind because of such drops in IBDP grades- especially as a international candidate?",

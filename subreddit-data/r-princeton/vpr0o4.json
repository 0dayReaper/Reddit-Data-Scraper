                    "comment": "Okay, I'll try to give a more detailed, objective response. \n\nForbes is divided into three general areas: the Main Inn, the Annex, and the New Wing. Generally, people like the main inn the most and the annex gets the worst rep. However, this is only partially accurate. The main inn is the \"hotel\" section of Forbes (literally - it used to be a hotel). The rooms in the main inn are generally doubles so you'd have one roommate, and are all air conditioned.  Bathrooms are either private or jack-and-jill, so split between two rooms. Generally, these rooms have some of the nicest amenities on campus, especially compared to Rocky/Mathey, which are not AC'd. For that reason, the main inn has the best rep. \n\nHowever, main inn rooms are a bit on the smaller side (e.g. it could be \\~130 sq ft for two people). Annex and new wing rooms tend to be larger. The new wing is connected to the main, and there's no immediate visual difference. However, this wing of Forbes is generally \\*not\\* air conditioned, unless you're on the third floor of the new wing, which recently got window units installed, and is sort of special and on its own, and tends to have a very tight zee group community. New wing rooms overall tend to be larger and have their own bathrooms, but are a bit less consistently layed out compared to the main.\n\nNow, the annex. People love to hate on the annex. You know you're in the annex if there's an 'A' in front of the room number. The annex has cinderblock walls, so it can look a bit weird. One side of the annex does not have air conditioning (A140-170 and A240-270), and it gets stuffy and disgusting. However, the rest of the annex is air conditioned. Annex rooms are also quite large compared to main inn rooms. The majority of rooms in the annex, as with most of Forbes in general, are doubles, but there are some rooms that are sort of triples: basically a double and a single are connected, and they share a private bathroom. In my opinion, these are some of the nicest little rooms in Forbes. The most annoying thing about the annex would be the communal bathrooms, simply because the showers are this weird polygonal shape that are sort of small and take getting used to. Overall, though, the annex is honestly fine (unless you're in the non AC side. That side sucks.) It has a nice little courtyard and it's almost never loud at night, so you can party and come back to a quiet area.",

It's on the edge of campus, but right across the street from the arts center, the McCarter theater, the Dinky bar, and Wawa. Whitman is two minutes away, so the whole \"Forbes is far\" thing is overblown. However, it \\*is\\* its own thing, and that makes for a strong community. Everything is connected in one building (most res colleges do not have that), and people get pretty close. There's a student run caf\u00e9, a nice game room with a pool table (which the frosh are always breaking. it always gets fixed but please stop.) and one of the only operable foosball tables on campus. There's a basement theater area, a dungeon-like library that honestly is a pretty good place to study, and a bunch of random lounge areas and hideouts. The staff are amazing and friendly. \n\nCommunity is one thing everyone on campus will reluctantly agree that Forbes is good at. They will try to mock Forbes A LOT during orientation, but that's just the \"cool\" thing to do.\n\nAlso, Sunday brunch, while good, is overrated. Everyone on campus comes to Forbes then. Saturday brunch is the best. They always have acai bowls. Pre-covid, you could serve yourself all the mango, pineapple, blueberry, strawberry, chocolate chip, etc. you wanted, but recently the bowls have been pre-made. I hope for your sake the supply chain resolves itself so you can experience the decadence of a la carte acai bowls.",

I think you hit the jackpot, and I wish you all the best out there. Princeton gets rough, in a lot of different ways, and there's always the chance you won't find your thing in Forbes specifically. I hope you do, though, because there's a lot to love about it. Even if you get put in the non AC part of the annex, which I have to admit is a pretty rough place to start, but not the end of the world. If you have any other questions about Pton in general feel free to DM me! Best of luck :)",

    "postText": "From my research there isn't an entire CogSci degree option. But the closest one would be Psychology as a degree option. However, there seems to be a \"certificate\" option available for CogSci, but how does that differ from a degree option as an undergrad?\n\nAlso, if I major in say Psychology or Computer Science (Bachelor of Arts), can I take cognitive science courses or \"concentrate\"/\"specialize\" in it?\n\nI'm a little confused over the terminologies so I appreciate any support!",

The beauty of a liberal arts education!\n* The certificate at Princeton is essentially the equivalent to a minor at other schools. So you could major in computer science and \"minor\" in cogsci by getting the certificate\n\nFinally, not sure if you looked into the [neuroscience](http://pni.princeton.edu/) department at all, but you can also major in that, and there seems to be a lot of overlap with cogsci there",

            "comment": "Princeton now no longer has concentrations and certificates\u2014starting with the class of 2026 and beyond, we use the major/minor system (concentrations are functionally majors and certificates are functionally minors). Don't ask me why we changed, or why we used any other method.\n\nIf Neuroscience or Psychology aren't majors you're interested in (with a CogSci minor), then you can try to make an Independent Major (formerly Independent Concentration).  But watch out\u2014they don't let you make independent majors which are just certificates done bigger (except for Linguistics, which is in a limbo state of not being a major because it's a minor, but many people still major in it\u2014again, don't ask me why).\n\nMany certificates are called programs (e.g. Program in Applied &amp; Computational Mathematics, known as the math certificate, or the Program in Linguistics, the linguistics certificate)\u2026 In fact, maybe all certificates are called programs? Program definitely ==&gt; certificate, but I don't know if certificate ==&gt; program (probably) but it largely doesn't matter.",

                    "comment": "Certificate does not directly mean program (but program does seem to mean certificate): programs are analogous to departments and are used for topics that are interdisciplinary or not part of one of Princeton's departments. A program administers its particular certificate, but some departments also administer certificates now. This has to do with the fact that a certificate couldn't be offered directly by a department, unless that certificate was created before the department was created. For example, the Neuroscience and African American Studies certificates were both created when there were no departments for these subjects, only programs. With the introduction of the new system, individual departments will be able to create their own minors that are located solely within that department.",

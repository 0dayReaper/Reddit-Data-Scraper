    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm an incoming freshman likely going to major in COS. For context, Princeton was my top choice and I'm so grateful to have been admitted. I committed the second I got in. But since then, I've spent some time reading up school, stalking the newspaper and reddit, etc., and it seems like the online consensus about Princeton leans negative. Ig this makes sense (happy people wouldn't write in to the newspaper to talk about how happy they are), but it's still making me a little nervous about my decision. \n\nI've read that\n\n* Princeton students are constantly stressed and have no free time. Staying on top of schoolwork is almost impossible and is all consuming\n* It's hard to acclimate freshman year\n* People are often isolated from each other\n* There is a very bad culture surrounding mental health\n* Princeton/surrounding town is no fun, there's no school spirit, few social opportunities, etc.\n* Food is bad (lol)\n\nSo I guess my question is are these things true, and if you could go back to senior year of HS, would you choose Princeton again? Any response is rly appreciated, but esp. if you are a current or recent student in COS or engineering. Thank you so much!!",

Princeton is a huge commitment and you want to be all in.\n\nI\u2019d do it again.\n\n\nThere were many times I really struggled at Princeton. I gained weight, I started medication for depression, my chronic health issues flared right up. I went during the pandemic which was very isolating.\n\nYou meet a ton wonderful, friendly and interesting people everywhere you look at Princeton. I learned more than I would have anywhere else. I was challenged, yes, but that launched my career about a decade ahead of where I\u2019d be otherwise. The parties are fun but extremely safe. Nobody pressured me to drink once in my four years. I made many lifetime friends, I got to see amazing arts, athletic feats, and have second to none intellectual conversations. I saw about a celebrity a month.\n\nFor me, the biggest piece of advice I\u2019d give is that school is the #1 priority and the better off you start, the easier it is to maintain momentum. Use the writing center, go to the study center (mcgraw), talk to your professors as often as they let you. If you manage the school part, the rest will fall into place.\n\nI got counselling and that helped me push through. I got some Ds during the pandemic but got an A on my thesis and a great public service job. Princeton\u2019s what you make of it but it led me to the right place and I wouldn\u2019t trade what I learned there",

As to your concerns...yes, Princeton is not an easy school and there are plenty of people who do struggle with their mental health. But there is a lot you can do to fight this, including keeping variety in your courseload, prioritizing rest/sleep, and setting realistic expectations for yourself - you do not have to be a perfect student or only ever get As and Bs.\n\nIsolation? I met my best, lifelong friends at Princeton. Spirit? 25K+ alumni come back for Reunions every year because they love the place so much. It's nicknamed the \"best damn place of all\" and that's only slightly hyperbole.\n\nIt is 100% normal and not a bad thing that you're apprehensive entering Princeton. There's plenty of negativity in the world to attune to, and Princeton is not a cake walk and never will be. It's designed to challenge you, both in your beliefs and your abilities, as you study alongside a group of peers who are eager to learn, under the instruction of some of the best scholars in the world.\n\nPlease be kind to yourself as you enter Princeton. Try out some easier classes alongside your harder ones. Seek out new relationships, but don't feel like you have to be best friends with everybody, even in your O/CA or zee group. Sign up for as many clubs as you want, and stick with the two or three you feel most at home in. And take some time to stop, breathe, and appreciate the opportunities you have, and the work you've put in to make it this far. Congratulations on getting in, and once again please ignore the losers/haters lower down in the comments \ud83d\ude44.",

Is there an ivory tower feel? Of course, you're on a collegiate gothic campus in the middle of New Jersey populated but a ton of smart, self confident, self driven people (of course some feelings of isolation may stem from the fact that you're surrounded by self confident, self driven people).\n\nEngineering or science is challenging for everyone (I was MOL), I feel like the professors enjoy giving students a lot of work, even in the non STEM majors.\n\nSimilarly as an adult, you have the responsibility for how you devote your time. I know it's initially hard, but I would try not to focus so much on the academics (what got you there in the first place), and explore as much as you can. You never know what you may find, and there will be no shortage of resources to help you get there if you ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd to be fair, it's hard to come up with counterfactuals for a decision made when 18...  \n\n\nEdit: When it comes to school spirit... I root for my home state school in college sports. But every once in awhile, Princeton Basketball gives us a season like this one!",

Mental health culture- you probably just read that article in the Prince, which i think is somewhat true but not overwhelmingly so. I wouldn't say people are really isolated from each other. Food: i mean it's not restaurant quality but it's decent for the most part. I think Princeton is one of the coolest places to live/study in the world. So many interesting people and things to experience. Definitely would choose it again and I never have regretted coming here",

I have not felt alone on campus for a single second.\n\n- Mental health has seen a dip in every school due to covid, it\u2019s just very vocalised here by a small group of people. You go to a school like Princeton to achieve high goals, a little bit of stress is part of that. Are you going to call time out when your running the biggest bank in the nation and a client is trying to sue you? \n\n- town has everything you need, the eating clubs offer an amazing opportunity for social life and partying. Some are selective but everybody who wants to join one can join one easily. There\u2019s also a great connection by train to NYC. I go about once a month.\n\n- I had a friend who went on officials to Yale, Harvard, Berkley, Texas, and Penn. And she told me this was the best food she had seen! Now with the new dhall\u2019s it\u2019s only gotten better!\n\nI think you will have a great time here, while getting the best education possible. Just be open to meet and connect with new people!",

            "comment": "The only bullet that I think you have right is that there's not much to do in Princeton itself, and school spirit is fairly low, but that's only in comparison to other, much larger schools. Yeah, it's not Michigan or Alabama, but it's easy to make it to New York, Philly, or even just New Brunswick if you want to do something off campus. But I had an awesome time at Princeton, it just took a little bit of adapting. The biggest thing I learned about balancing social lives is that, since you're *always* expected to be working, nobody is going to think twice if you stop working to do something fun. I knew a guy who was constantly stoned, drinking, or playing video games, he graduated MAE, and last I knew he's got a 6-figure job as an engineer somewhere. He had to buckle down and pull some all-nighters, I'm sure he wasn't getting stellar grades, but don't let anyone tell you that you can't have fun and graduate successfully (though maybe don't take it as far as he did). \n\nFor me personally, I found great success in a topic that I found fascinating, and graduated with grades that I was generally proud of...but not in the field I wanted to work in. I got my butt kicked, and it took me a few years to have the drive to pursue further education in a field I did want to work in. I'm happy with where I'm at now, and Princeton definitely taught me a lot about who I am, what I want in life, and how to achieve those things, but I originally wanted to be MAE, and I personally was unable to balance the social and academic aspects of the engineering school. But a lot of my friends could, and if you say you can, then I would believe you. \n\nUltimately, to answer your question, I don't know if I'd do it again. Some of my high school friends, who I know I was a better student than, managed to become engineers, and I often wonder if I'd have been more successful elsewhere. But hindsight is 20/20, and assuming I would learn the same things about myself anywhere else, I have to believe I would be yearning for my current profession no matter where I went. If I did decide to return to Princeton, given the chance to go back and do it again, it would be *because* of the social aspect, not in spite of it. \n\nNo matter what you decide, I'm sure you will be successful at the end of the day. You were accepted to Princeton after all, and I'm sure you will be capable of managing friendships, academics and social engagements, even if it's not always comfortable. Best of luck, and thanks for letting me ramble. It's a good question, and it was very cathartic to answer!",

Don't worry too much about what you've read.\n\n* The work can be quite stressful if you're aiming for high grades, but there tends to be a lot of academic support, although the support may fall off for higher-level classes. I was able to stay on top of the work most of the time - sometimes it felt overwhelming but I always pushed through. Making friends in the same classes as you will help a ton.\n\n Some humanities courses make you do a lot of reading. I hate doing readings, but for COS classes you generally don't have to do much reading. \n\n I ended up having a good amount of free time, which I largely spent gaming (which may be obvious from my past activity on this reddit account). Thankfully I still kept my GPA high.\n\n* I acclimated well in freshman year since I took university classes in high school but that may not hold for everyone.\n\n* I wouldn't really say people are isolated - despite being a very introverted person, I've made several of the best friendships I've ever had at Princeton, mainly due to CA and my freshman zee group. If you're a more social person and like going to clubs you'll do even better. Also, unlike me, you likely won't be sent home for 1.5 academic years due to the pandemic.\n\n* I never really utilized counseling or mental health services so I can't speak on that. But I have never noticed any bad culture surrounding mental health. If anything, mental health is highly emphasized and there are many study breaks &amp; other events.\n\n* Princeton's campus is beautiful (caveat: there is a lot of construction going on right now) and there are many events that take place in any given the year. School spirit does not seem bad from what I've seen, and I don't even attend any sports events. There are many clubs and many social opportunities.\n\n* The food is not bad, I've been to every dining hall multiple times and been to many of the nearby restaurants. There is a lot of variety. The newest dining hall (Yeh/NCW) is particularly good. But I'm not a particularly picky eater so your experience may differ.\n\nIf I could go back to HS, I would definitely choose Princeton again.",

College challenges people in ways that they usually haven't been challenged before, and it's really common to focus exclusively on academia, do worse than your own standards, focus on hitting that personal goal to the detriment of the rest of your life, and let all that together harm your mental health. This certainly happens at Princeton, and can happen anywhere.\n\nIt's really common for people to draw meaning only from academics, and I think that's probably the most dangerous trap you could fall into in college. It's \\*really\\* important that you find something that you enjoy doing and find meaningful that is usually not also a source of stress. Princeton can be bad on this front too- plenty of clubs and organizations are competitive and high pressure, and plenty of people rightly get burned out because they haven't actually found something restful for them, they've just moved the pressure from academics to a club.\n\nWhich is a long way to say that the best way to find community, prevent isolation, and keep a sense of self-worth is to find at least one thing that you enjoy doing and find relaxing with other people. My Freshman year, I made an impromptu club of people who would just watch Jeopardy together in the common room, and we did quiz bowl together for a hot minute before we decided we didn't have the time to travel. As a Sophomore, I joined the Band, even though I didn't know how to read music. I was the Santa Guy for a few years, and I met tons of lifelong friends. The time I spent on these things harmed my academics a little- I would've benefitted from spending more time studying, and going to Harvard for a football game the night before my Orgo midterm was not a particularly wise decision in retrospect, but it made Princeton a \\*much\\* better experience for me. I also made my own club, and the university gave me plenty of resources to do fun things, including a van and a stipend to spend on trips off campus. \n\nI think it's normal to worry that spending time making yourself happy will harm your academics somehow, but I think this is a symptom of a wider cultural norm that academic performance is the only thing that really matters, and I think that norm misses the mark a bit.  Princeton has plenty of places to find meaning and community. Making that space for yourself can sometimes be at odds with academic life, which is why you hear all of these scary things- I just want to broadly make the point that academic achievement isn't the only thing you're allowed to find meaningful from your time in college, and that if you decide to find meaning in other spaces, Princeton has lots of them.",

            "comment": "I would definitely choose Princeton again - my experience got better each year, and while the workload was a lot, I feel that overall I enjoyed the academic experience. Many students and professors do care about mental health, though it\u2019s important to seek out resources and help as needed. I found social life on campus to be very active and engaging, and nearly every Princeton student I\u2019ve met has been nice/interesting/smart/curious - which all makes for good socializing. \n\nAs a COS major, I\u2019ve been especially glad to be studying COS at Princeton! The department is especially good at teaching introductory courses for first years and sophomores. \n\nI remember feeling very nervous when I was an incoming first year, especially because of what I read online. While it may be true, it may not be accurate to your experience, and it definitely starts to feels much more manageable once you are in the moment, rather than reading about it online.",

Staying on top of schoolwork is almost impossible and is all consuming.\n\n**Any student worth their salt will be fine. For those that lag or come from weaker academic backgrounds, of course they'll struggle.**\r\n\nIt's hard to acclimate freshman year\n\n**skill issue tbh**\r\n\nPeople are often isolated from each other\n\n**What lol who said this**\n\nThere is a very bad culture surrounding mental health\n\n**Kinda ties in with the above, if you get your ass handed to you by your classes because you're underprepared you're gonna feel dead inside**\n\nPrinceton/surrounding town is no fun, there's no school spirit, few social opportunities, etc.\n\n**Depends on who you are. If you're a frat boy/city boy obv suburb life is going to be boring. School spirit is mid yeah but we're not a sports school. Lack of social opportunities is so not true, just touch grass and join a club or something**\r\n\nFood is bad (lol)\n\n**Yeh/NCW and Rocky are good. The really shit one (Wucox) closed down this year so you don't have to worry about that anymore. Compared to places like MIT the food is pretty alright.**",

I'm ECE and poor as fuck -- Princeton has a pretty great communty for poor gang (SIFP) and the classes are all very solid (especially the liberal arts classes). STEM you can always self-teach if you're motivated - the benefit of humanities classes is listening to other perspectives, particularly the Professor's.",

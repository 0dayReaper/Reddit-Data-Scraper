Got an email today welcoming him/us to Whitman College and I almost deleted it thinking it was spam from a random college! (There is actually a Whitman College in Walla Walla Washington!). I see that Whitman is only a 6-7 minute walk to the Bent Spoon (depending how motivated you are to acquire ice cream), so that\u2019s a plus! :)",

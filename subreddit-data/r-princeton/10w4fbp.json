He did a good job faking that princeton.edu email. \n\nI didn\u2019t do that. However, he tricked a few desperate people last year which got them all rejected. I got waitlisted then rejected. But I think if they hadn\u2019t put his email, they would\u2019ve had a better chance. \n\nHis cousin goes to Princeton so he has a decent understanding of the campus, as like he is a student himself, which is why he can lie successfully.",

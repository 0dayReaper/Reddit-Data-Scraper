There's an undergraduate fellowship that meets on Tuesdays and grad student/young adult fellowship that meets on Wednesdays. Please do get in touch if you have any questions!",

There\u2019s also a Catholic service in the chapel I believe, but I haven\u2019t attended. The Methodist church is also very nice and somewhat close with nice preachers, but I only went once. I have friends who are members of NOVA or the LDS students association, but never attended either of their respective churches.",

    "postText": "hello! i'm heading to pt in the fall (class of '26) and applied as an orfe major. I've always liked math and want to go into finance but i have very little experience with math competitions/cos. \n\nin high school, i was super business orientated. i made 501c3 and did lots of debate but i'm super nervous i can't handle the level of math. btw i'm taking mv calc and diff eq right now.  \n\nany advice on any books/study material/gen advice is appreciated!!",

And recognize that there isn\u2019t anything wrong with changing majors if it ends up not being your cup of tea! You can 1000% get a business job without being an ORFE major, unless there\u2019s a super specific one you want. With you liking debate, I could see you enjoying Econ or SPIA too - something that is math and more policy too.\n\nEnjoy!!!",

The more important question is whether or not you actually want to do study ORFE. Be aware that this major could just as easily be named Operations research and industrial engineering. All of a sudden, it\u2019s probably way less interesting. \n\nWould encourage you to not view ORFE as just more mathy economics, and there are not many more opportunities that ORFE would open that economics wouldn\u2019t. By contrast, CS would perhaps open quite a few more doors. Source: ORFE turned COS \u201825",

    "postText": "Hello. I am international student applying to Princeton for class of 2027, and I have questions about Graded Paper. I have never written at school something similar to it since our English course is very basic. Therefore, I will have to write new on my own and ask teacher for evalution  \n1. What kind of topic I should choose? Can it be something except of analysing literature and history? For example, I would like to write about advantages and disadvantages of Zoos and give specific examples.  \n2. Is 500 words long essay would be enough? Or it should be longer-shorter?  \n3. How important the role Graded-paper to the application?  \nThank you in advance for response",

            "comment": "1. It can be anything but preferably English or History. I think writing about the advantages and disadvantages of zoos can be seen as a typical essay that does not give enough information about your writing skills, and not one in an academic context. I suggest you to choose something like a poem or literature text and analyze it in a way to demonstrate your writing skills in an academic context. You can see online how you can analyze a literature text using ethos, pathos, and logos and try to do the same. You can still write your zoo one but I am not sure if they will them enough information to consider it an addition to your application. \n\n\n2. 500 words are fine. They said from one to two pages. \n\n\n3. It depends on your overall application, but Princeton focuses more on academics (including the graded paper) and treat it as an important part of the application to see how you will strive in Princeton's environment. \n\nAnother suggestion is to try to minimize the spelling and grammatical errors you may make when you are writing the graded paper AND the application essays. They focus on these things. \n\nGood luck.",

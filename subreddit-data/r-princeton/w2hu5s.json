    "postText": "Should I try and use Freshman Seminar to tick off some gen ed requirements? For context I'm planning on doing BA in something in social sciences (history, intl relations, etc) and I was thinking about taking a SEN/SEL freshman seminar but don't want to be hindered with a lot of quantitative work. What do you guys suggest",

            "comment": "Definitely worth it! Also classes in more social science adjacent fields, like psychology, often have accessible SEN/SEL options. From my point of view SEN/SEL FRS options might be more focused on understanding science rather than \u201cdoing science\u201d in the strictly quantitative sense. Freshman seminars are especially useful for exploring a random topic in depth - so if it\u2019s interesting to you, it\u2019s probably a good, lowkey option to fulfill the requirement (depending on the professor, style of assignments, etc and how that aligns with the type of work you like to do)",

It was good for me to have passion for the topic because it was also a wake-up call that I wasn\u2019t ready for college-level essay writing and needed to learn that fast. And on a fantastic side note, I also met my now wife in that seminar",

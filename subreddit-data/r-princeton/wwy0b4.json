            "comment": "Social life is great imo. People hang out with each other all the time, whether it be house parties, studying together, getting meals together, etc. In my experience, because the student population is relatively small, I often pass by people I know and say hi to them all around campus. As long as you're not extremely (extremely) introverted, you'll find friends to hang out with. However, depending on your major, some people will have more time than others to do non-academic stuff, especially on weekdays. Nevertheless, most house parties, eating club parties, and other big events are held on the weekends (especially nights).\n\nPrinceton itself does throw one school ball in the fall, but the bigger events are the Lawn Parties. These are campus-wide darties that last a whole day one day each semester usually right before reading period. Whether or not you're into partying, it's a great time to just have fun with friends.\n\nImmediately off campus, however, there's not much to do besides restaurants. Train transportation to NYC or Philly is pretty accessible for weekend trips though.",

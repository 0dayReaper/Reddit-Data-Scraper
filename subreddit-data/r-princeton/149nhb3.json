TBH... its a flat earther claiming they are a Doctor of pathology, saying they got the doctorate at Princeton.\n\nIs anyone able to search the database for me?\n\nI'm from Australia and have no idea how to do this, if its possible, or even if its legal.. if not, then disregard my request.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.",

It stands for **D**octor of **Ph**ilosophy, but it covers most academic fields. \n\nPrinceton does have MD-PhD students (who receive both a medical doctorate and a PhD), they are usually PhDs in molecular biology. I've never heard of a PhD in pathology here. There is a possibility they have a PhD in molbio and a MD with a specialization in pathology, but the MD would be from Rutger's, not Princeton. We have no med school, so we don't give MDs here (MD-PhD students usually do med school at Rutger's and PhD here).",

My PhD is technically in genetics, but the uniting theme of all of my research, including my doctoral thesis, has been radiation biology, so I usually tell people that in casual conversation because it's more explanatory than what my diploma says. That is absolutely technically incorrect, but if I tell people that my PhD is in genetics, they ask me to fill out Punnett squares. It's not ridiculous that somebody doing basic science in a stereotypically medical field would do the same thing I do- although I usually clarify like this when people ask me for more detail on it.",

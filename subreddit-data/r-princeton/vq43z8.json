    "postText": "Forbes: known for being far from the center of campus, but it\u2019s close to the Dinky, Wawa, Lewis center for the arts, and McCarter theater. It also is known for its Sunday brunch with a chocolate fountain (you can also get omelettes at lunch any day, and other than at brunch the dining hall is never crowded since it\u2019s far). This is my original res college. It used to be a hotel, and that means rooms in the main inn have bathrooms (with bathtubs!) despite being doubles. The annex is to one side and is standard cinderblock dorm rooms with hall bathrooms. Supposedly there is AC, but it is slight, and not under personal thermostat control. Whole thing is connected, which is nice. Named for the son of the Forbes that created the magazine.\n\nWhitman: Between elm street and Pyne drive, looks like a castle, but less collegiate gothic and a little bit Romanesque. Nice rooms, whole place is only like 15 years old, AC (with thermostat control), lots of quads available. Named for eBay executive. Dining hall has crepes at brunch. Whole thing is connected by arches and stuff outside, but not all internally connected. I lived in Wendell sophomore year (because of Covid).\n\nButler: most rooms were redone in last 15 years, so pretty nice with AC and thermostat, nice common rooms, kinda gives modern hotel vibes inside. Outside is kinda ugly brick. Has nice basement lounge, and a store called studio 34. Buildings all disconnected. Sucky dining hall (\u201cwucox\u201d) that was shared with the now defunct Wilson/first college, known for its bland chicken breast and for being super crowded due to its centrality. Lots of singles and quads.\n\nRocky and Mathey share a dining hall and are the classic collegiate gothic dorms. No ac. Sometimes have to go up or down several floors for a bathroom. Very convenient access to Nassau street and old campus. Classic buildings like Blair arch are part of these (I think it\u2019s Mathey). Rocky is named for grandson of standard oil Rockefeller. Variety of room types, including weird things like triples. They have slightly different vibes that someone else can explain in the comments, but tbh I think of them as the same. I lived in Little, which is upperclass but also Mathey, last year.\n\nYeh and new college west are new, but should be nice - idk if any frosh are living there next year.",

Everything he\u2019s allergic to. \nThey moved him second semester to \u201chypoallergenic housing\u201d in another building but even with air filters that situation was just ok. \n\nMy suggestion is that if you know you have allergies, speak up asap. The allergies/asthma crowd need special accommodations at such an old school and we did not know this going in. \n\nHe\u2019s excited to be in Yeh - brand new housing with AC this Fall.",

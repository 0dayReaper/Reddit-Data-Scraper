    "postText": "Hi!! I\u2019m an incoming freshman and I could not be more excited about joining the Princeton community! I have a few questions about freshmen dorms. When do they tell you your roommate/dorm assignment? Are most dorms singles or doubles? Do they give you any info about your room so you can plan decor and stuff?",

            "comment": "Sometime in the summer you'll get your Res College, dorm, room number, and roomates; think for me it was like a month before I went to Princeton, but it's been a while so I could be wrong.\n\nDepends on the college, but I can definitely say its unlikely you'll get a single. Sure, there's some, but you're much more likely to get a quad or double. For example, if you're in Butler, there's a very high percentage you'll have a quad.\n\nAs for info about your room, no. You can find the floor plan, but that's about it. You'll get a list of what you can and can't bring as well.",

    "postText": "Just recently got into Princeton on Ivy Day and I wanted to know where most people end up after graduating a top CS/Ivy school like Princeton. I heard about some ppl who end up doing Quant, SWE at FAANG, or research but what is the general trend/which is most common among the ppl? Also, if you are currently doing CS at Princeton, what category do you personally see yourself falling into (Quant/SWE at FAANG, Research, etc.)? Enlighten me on any other paths ppl take as well.",

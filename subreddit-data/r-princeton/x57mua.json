            "comment": "The department is excellent, but like with most things it's what you make of it. What makes Princeton so special is the opportunities it presents students who want to go above and beyond what's required.  If you want to go to grad school, you need to be seeking out those opportunities. Get involved in research early. Spend a summer on campus working with faculty. Do MORE than they ask. \n\nDoctoral admissions is all about research potential. Get your name on a published paper. Get a recommendation that says you actively contributed to ongoing research. Those things let you go anywhere. \n\nBackground: I sat on the phd admissions committees for computer science for years at Stanford and UVA",

            "comment": "To my knowledge, no. Amherst College is D3, so for sure definitely not them as Princeton is D1, but I am not sure of UMass Amherst. To my knowledge, again the answer is no - Princeton seems to stay pretty geographically close in terms of non-ivy athletic competition, so eastern PA schools especially. \nI am finding a few traces of UMass online vs. Princeton, but only Hockey and Lacrosse. In Women\u2019s Hockey, they only played each other 5 times since 2002, with the last time in 2018.\nHOWEVER, I could easily be wrong here, so double check me, but my impression is no to both Amhersts.",

I thought it might be possible for colleges to be in different divisions for different sports, like D-1 for football but D-3 for squash or something. I thought that maybe Princeton and Amherst Coll might compete in some sports even if not others.",

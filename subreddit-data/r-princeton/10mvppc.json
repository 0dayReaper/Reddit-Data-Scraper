    "postText": "Hello, I was recently admitted into a graduate program at Princeton and was wondering if anyone in a similar situation was looking for a roommate. I am a 21 year old male engineering student looking for a few others to go in on an apartment near campus for the upcoming school year. If you are interested in possibly rooming with me please respond so we can start lease hunting!",

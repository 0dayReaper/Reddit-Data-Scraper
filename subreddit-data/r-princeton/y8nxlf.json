It didn't feel like they really started searching until Wednesday and Thursday(today). I don't know why they didn't stop construction and have everyone search the area immediately (like they ended up eventually doing today). I don't know how they're claiming they don't have any video footage when there are cameras all around cameras, nor do I understand why it took them from Sunday night (when her parents called) to Monday night to issue the statement that someone was missing. No one had seen her since Friday, and she wasn't there when her roommate woke up on Friday. It was completely negligent to take so long to actually start looking (which tbh they didn't really do Tuesday it seemed)",

The new DLC character came out recently so I wanted to play online but apparently servicenet doesn\u2019t have good enough internet to support online matches because it keeps telling me \u201cone or more consoles are not responding\u201d. Has anyone figured out a way of bypassing this? Or am I stuck playing offline until I graduate? :(",

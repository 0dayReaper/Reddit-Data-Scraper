Are there ways of earning money once on campus (scholarships/grants I can apply for, internships, jobs, etc)?",

There are plenty of jobs on/near campus, but at max (working 20 hours per week, which I don\u2019t think is a good idea) you\u2019re going to be making $4k/semester.",

Most are online nowadays but there are some that are in-person at the Princeton Public Library, which is pretty close to campus.",

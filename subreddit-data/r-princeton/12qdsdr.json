    "postText": "Hi! I'm a HS senior and am really struggling with my college decision. I hope to major in CS or something adjacent to that like CE. I definitely believe that Princeton will provide me with amazing opportunities and I love everything about the school, except the cost...\n\nThis becomes especially difficult for me because I know I could go to other great schools for little to no cost. With my academics and the national merit finalist award, I could go to somewhere like Texas A&amp;M for basically free; and they seem to have a really solid engineering program too.\n\nI really want to go to Princeton but just can't get over the voice in the back of my head that says taking on that debt is a gamble that won't pay off. Any words of advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTake care!",

They like to tout that ~80% of their student body will graduate debt free, but I believe that's because it isn't the *students* taking on the debt, rather, it's the parents.\n\nThe whole need based system is based on the income of the parents, and their equation is pretty simple. The annual amount a student has to pay = (income of household - $100,000) * .25. So anyone with a family income of &lt;$100,000 will pay nothing, and someone with a family income of ~$200,000 would pay ~$25,000. They also take into account things like sibling college attendance and medical health situations, but that's the gist of what I understand.\n\nThey heavily incentivize the parents of the students to take on any debt with loans from Princeton itself, which is very compelling due to the low interest rate. So Princeton gets to hold onto the money and use it at their discretion with interest earnings.\n\nI'm not comfortable disclosing any exact financial situation, but I hope it helps clarify the situation. Also yes, I know that what Princeton provides is much more than a good education.",

I don\u2019t have to constrain my career in any way, and I\u2019m not constantly stressed about my next payment. My state school got my a solid job offer ($102K starting), and I got to *choose* between top tier PhD programs.

In the end I\u2019m still going to one of those schools for my PhD, so maybe it didn\u2019t change anything? \n\nYou should talk with your parents, as well as graduates of both school. It\u2019s right for you to think about this so early. Ultimately, only you can make the \u201cright\u201d decision. Reach out to ptons financial aid office if possible, maybe they can help you make the choice. \n\nAlso, out of curiosity\u2014how much debt would you be in?

I know two ppl who HAD to attend another school because they (mostly meaning their parents) couldn\u2019t afford to attend Princeton\u2014even after applying for FinAid. To help clarify with an example, if someone\u2019s parents make 220k/year, they would most likely get 0 aid. Many parents wouldn\u2019t be willing to instantly adjust their lifestyle to that of someone who made 140k\u2014which may require moving houses even (as I\u2019ve seen with my friend).",

As for me, my parents will offer some help, but I am still facing most of the cost, so I'm trying to figure out what makes Princeton worth the extra investment for other people so I can make an educated decision.\n\nThis is the hard thing about it, there are just as many people that say \"debt free is always the best answer\" as people who believe \"Princeton is worth it, no matter what\". It is so much more complicated than that and you've already beaten me to the punch, there are many nuanced situations that require careful consideration and I just want to better understand mine.",

The financial aid calculation accounts for the family finances and is awarded so your family does not need to take on loans. If your parents are not paying what they could and you are on your own, then you could be forced to take out loans.",

            "comment": "you cannot double major at princeton, mainly due to the requirement of senior theses. there are minors (formerly called certificates) in neuroscience and cogsci that you can pursue. i\u2019m not sure about restrictions on what can be chosen but generally people do not pursure more than 2 certificates alongside their major.\n\nalso unclear on what you mean by \u201cdifferent electives\u201d but you do have some flexibility to explore fields outside of your major, moreso if you\u2019re AB than BSE. in junior year changing your major may be difficult depending on the requirements of the major you want to switch into and the classes you\u2019ve already taken, but def possible",

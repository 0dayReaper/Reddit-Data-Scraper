They are still cooking for tons of students and that makes it harder to do fresh/great/healthy all at once. There\u2019s always a salad bar and healthy options but they aren\u2019t incredible - they are servicable.\n\nYou could take a bus to Wegmans or Whole Foods which has good produce but not super easily. There is D\u2019Angelos Italian Market in walking distance but I\u2019ve never been personally. It\u2019s also harder to make food especially as a freshman/sophomore in a res college.",

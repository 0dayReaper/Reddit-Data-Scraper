However, if you\u2019re at all interested in other fields like Econ, humanities, and other social sciences, Princeton will be better. Princeton will give you the opportunity to explore a bunch of different fields and their intersections because of its liberal arts focus. However, it still has a phenomenal CS department with elite faculty. I don\u2019t think MIT will allow as much of a liberal arts exploration. However, if you\u2019re 10000% sure on CS and only want to study that, MIT might be the place for you. you\u2019ll also probably be surrounded by engineers and STEM people at MIT, whereas Princeton students have very diverse majors (adding to the well-rounded education).",

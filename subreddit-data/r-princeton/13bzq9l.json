My advisors didn't stop me from doing it, but they did tell me they thought it was weird I was able to since apparently most advise not to do that. \n\nI didn't do the regular physics sequence because, since I wanted to major in engineering, I thought the engineering physics sequence would be better. Also because I heard the physics sequence can be really difficult with not so good lectures and weekly quizzes. I don't know much about the regular physics sequence, but I would say egr physics is very engineering-based, with very hands-on labs.",

Because since you said designing, 3D printing, product building, etc that sounds genuinely interesting, since it\u2019s more \u201capplicable\u201d or real-world rooted, which sounds super enjoyable",

Although I will say that depending on the professor, the lectures can be boring or hard to follow. The professors are really sweet and passionate though so going to office hours helps that. Also, the PSETS can cause you to have to make a lot of assumptions that could be wrong, so going to office hours would also help that.",

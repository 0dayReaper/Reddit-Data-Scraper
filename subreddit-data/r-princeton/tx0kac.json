The res colleges are pretty similar, but I\u2019d say Forbes is a bit different because it\u2019s farther away from the center of campus and more \u201chomey.\u201d Butler is really nice with good common areas and a pretty good location. Mathey and Rockefeller are a mixed bag honestly but very pretty on the outside. First is pretty bad but it\u2019s being torn down after this year. Also, New College East and West are new for 2022, so I think they\u2019d be more modern, but they\u2019re still being constructed so I\u2019m not sure lol.",

Old Wilson) is stem kids they DO expect to make it so they can get to class on time after staying up until 5am working on psets. And Rocky/Mathey are for the lib arts kids, the dreamers who need something pretty to look at as they write flowery essays.\n\nBut in all seriousness, it's random",

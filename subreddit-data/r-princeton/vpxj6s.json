No AC will be a horrible in first few weeks, especially if you\u2019re top floor. Make sure to bring fans (multiple if you have them)! Depending on your building, the bathrooms might not be the nearest to the room (i.e might have to go up or down a floor). Some halls are better than others. Edwards and little are known to be the better ones (still no AC tho). Mathey is the only res college with a separate endowment so you\u2019ll get study breaks with good food most weeks",

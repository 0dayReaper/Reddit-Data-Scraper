    "postText": "I will be doing an internship from early May to late August 2023 in Princeton, NJ. I am still looking for housing in the area, but I wanted to ask you guys advice on what I should do for transport to work. I am hoping my commute will be under 10 miles one way, so \\~20 miles roundtrip. I currently own a motorcycle in good condition, but I am wondering whether I should be using this as my mode of transportation for commuting to work every day. I am worried my co workers might think I am irresponsible; I always ride safe with the full gear and I ride responsibly, but I am concerned. This is one of the reasons I am thinking of renting/leasing a car to go to work. Public transport is not really a good option due to the travel time and distance. Please give advice, thanks.",

I don't ride on highways -- I select the option to give me a route that avoids highways on google maps. So far I've only used it for street riding to be safe.",

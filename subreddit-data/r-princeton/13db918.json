I wish I had known sooner, but you can go to any in the residential colleges (yeh and ncw, the newest, are the best for that), but the most practice rooms are in Woolworth Hall by Frist Campus Center. You just have to go to the admin office on the 3rd floor of the building and request access, and they give it on a semester basis. The online form doesn\u2019t get much attention, so going in person is best.",

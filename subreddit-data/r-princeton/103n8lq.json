    "postText": "Greetings,\n\nMy wife and I may be moving to area and wanted to learn more about the daycare landscape.  Obviously moving with a toddler is a whole new ballgame and just trying to be prepared.  Any Princeton staff here that have been in our shoes recently and can help with a few quick questions?\n\n1 - Does the university daycare or other top options near campus have current openings or should we expect a long waitlist?  We\u2019ve sent a few emails but haven\u2019t heard back from schools.  \n\n2 - Are nanny shares an option in the area?  \n\nOpen to any and all suggestions for a 18-24 month year old.",

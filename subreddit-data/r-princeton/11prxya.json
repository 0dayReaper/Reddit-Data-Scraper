    "postText": "To start,  I know these two schools aren\u2019t even close to being comparable in this aspect.\nAs an admitted senior in HS who\u2019s top choice is Princeton, I am a little hesitant about my social life there. \nI am also considering UT Austin (CS &amp; Plan II Honors with a full ride). I have been to many Greek events down here and love the social action, but fear I\u2019d be missing out a bit at Princeton. As someone who likes to unwind and go out to drink with friends, can I find my group at Princeton?",

Like 99% of Princeton undergrads live on campus all 4 years, so it was easy to have a social life. I was heavily involved in my extracurriculars and my eating club. There was plenty of partying, for those who wanted to party--I really didn't feel like I \"missed out.\"\n\nAlso as a bonus, I find eating clubs to be preferable to traditional frats &amp; sororities because they're co-ed, rather than creepily gender segregated.",

I was in one student group that had frequent dorm room parties and was as strongly affiliated with one particular eating club.\n\nI graduated before COVID so I don't know if that changed the culture significantly, but I certainly did not find Princeton to be a place where everyone just sits inside and studies 24/7 without having any fun. I mean, Princeton is a school that has a massive 3 day drinking fest every single year called Reunions--the second largest private alcohol order in America after NASCAR.",

There\u2019s a very strong career bias towards anyone in top 20 schools, let alone top 3.\n\nut austin is one of the best public schools in the country with one of the most sought-after and selective CS programs in the world. I'm not denying that princeton would probably open more doors, but employers and grad schools in CS certainly wouldn't be so significantly biased towards princeton over UT as some people seem to believe.",

My son is going to be an incoming freshman in fall and they are really taking care of him. I guess if I get a promotion and double my salary I may have to pay $15 grand for a couple years but I would be ok with that.  Princeton has really upped there game to utilize there large endowment and make themselves affordable for even higher middle income Families that can get in.  Just as they set the standard for no loans now they are setting new standards on need based aid and Stanford has already increased there need levels for 2023 as well and I bet. Harvard, Yale and others won\u2019t be far behind but Princeton is leading the way which says something more about them then just the $$$.

Would probably improve your supplements too.",

Y'know, I emailed all the schools admissions offiers about this question, looked at the FAQ page from the different schools, and looked up the gen ed requirements for each. So thanks. Im not an idiot, and asking this question on Reddit was not the first source dumdum. But anyways, thx for the advice!",

            "comment": "So in the math and science areas, you have three gen Ed\u2019s. You need one quantitative and computational reasoning course and 2 science and engineering courses, one of which needs a lab component. For the QCR requirement, most of what you do will have to be math related, but there are definitely courses that focus on the math surrounding politics, social issues, and more.\nFor the SEL/SEN requirement, you\u2019ve got some for freedom. There are a lot of courses that cover either the SEL requirement or the LA requirement, and others look at the intersections of art and science.\nI took the liberty of looking through the course registrar for you. For the QCR requirement, some do the classes that look interesting are courses like Math Alive, that describe themselves as having \u201cemphasis on ideas, not on sophisticated mathematical techniques\u201d and focus on modern applications to math. For SEL/SEN, there are courses like \u201cMusical Instruments, Sound, Perception, and Creativity\u201d which involves composing music based on scientific principles. Another is \u201cWriting about Science\u201d, which is essentially a science journalism class. \nObviously, you will have to do some science and math in the science and math gen eds, but you\u2019ll have plenty of options within each section to find something that interests you. Best of luck!",

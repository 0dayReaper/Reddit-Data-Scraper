    "postText": "Hello, international student here. So basically the application for Princeton requires the school report and transcript but those two literally mean the same thing in my country and the school report they ask me to submit doesn\u2019t involve individual grades for our assignments they just include an overall score for each subject. Also Princeton asks us to submit a written paper which should include the teachers grade and comments so i don\u2019t know how to submit my written paper with my grades. Did any of the international students struggle with this? Should i mail the admission office?",

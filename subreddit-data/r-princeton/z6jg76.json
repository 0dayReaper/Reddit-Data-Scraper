Yes i know that volunteering shouldnt be measured in hours and pursued for the sake of uni apps, but hours offer a good general indicator. Tks guys!",

I haven't gone around asking people for the amount of hours they did in high school so I couldn't tell you if that's average or not but it seems fine to me. I'm sure there are people here with thousands so trying to compare upwards is never going to get you anything but disappointment. Just focus on your essays and interview.",

            "comment": "So, something you have to keep in mind: Ivy applications aren't evaluated as a checklist. Having more community service hours doesn't \"win you points\" compared to someone who had fewer hours, because at a certain point it's just...not distinguishing. Nearly everyone has that 4.0 GPA, volunteer hours, club leaderships, and such.\n\nWhat actually sets you apart is having a unique, compelling, cohesive story about who you are, why you are special, and why YOU are exceptional even among the most qualified candidates in the country.\n\nUnless community service is something you are legitimately passionate about, is core to your identity, and you would WANT to be doing it outside of resume padding? You're kind of wasting your time, and would be better off putting those hours towards your own personal narrative-fulcrum, or finding one if you don't know what that is.",

That said, your application looks competitive - the biggest weak points are your standardized test scores (below average for Princeton), but plenty of people get in with worse scores. Keep up the good work, keep your grades high, work hard on your essays, and if you have time try to bring up your SAT. Good luck!",

It won\u2019t mean you get in\u2014I\u2019ve written good recommendations for many impressive young people who have been flat out denied\u2014but I would say you are in the ballpark. The reality is that there are vastly more qualified applicants than spots, so good luck, but if it doesn\u2019t work, don\u2019t get down, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do well in whatever you set your mind to.",

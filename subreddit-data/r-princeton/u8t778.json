    "postText": "Mid-30s NJ resident here, posting in this sub because college-age donors are ideal for this procedure. Apologies if this post breaks any sub rules. \n\nI've been dealing with a pretty intense functional GI disorder and after a whole lot of testing and 10+ different medications that didn't help I've exhausted the treatment options that doctors can currently provide. Among the various homeopathic remedies that can be found through naturopaths and the internet is a pretty radical treatment called [FMT or Fecal Microbiota Transplant]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_microbiota_transplant) which, with stool from a high-quality donor, can be performed by the patient at home. [This webcomic explains it pretty well, believe it or not]( http://threewordphrase.com/donor.htm).\n\nIt's gross, but not as gross as being sick for the rest of my life would be, so I'm trying to have a sense of humor about it. This procedure is approved, and is highly effective for treatment of C. Difficile infection, but so far it has not been approved for any other indication despite promising research so my doctor unfortunately can't be involved.\n\nThe donor criteria is extremely strict and unfortunately none of my friends or family qualify, so I figured I would see if a kind stranger from the internet might help me with this weird, awkward thing that could improve my life one million percent.\n\nIf you or someone you know meet the following base criteria and would be willing to explore being a donor, please reach out to me via PM here or e-mail fmtftact1@gmail.com\n\t\n\nMale\n\nAge 15-30\n\nLean body type\n\nEssentially perfect physical and mental health\n\nNo allergies or food sensitivities\n\nVaried diet\n\nDaily perfect stool production,  presenting as [Bristol Type 3 Stool]( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c35d0b78-61cf-47f2-9c99-99c614898586/apt13746-fig-0001-m.png)\n\n\n\nThere are some more involved questions that would need to be answered, and a potential donor would have to be screened for pathogens, but after that all they would need to do is come to a convenient location and make a deposit, so to speak. I am local to North Jersey but will happily travel to make this happen.\n\nThanks for reading!",

I wouldn't be pursuing it DIY if I wasn't desperate, but I do think in the future FMT will be a prominent treatment option for a variety of conditions. I just can't wait that long. Sad to say, I think there are a lot of people in the same position.",

Theres a couple published work showing a relationship between your microbiome and dna methylation/epigenetics too. But of course intercecal transplants are interesting as is",

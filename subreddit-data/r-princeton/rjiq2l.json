    "postText": "Hey everyone, I got into Princeton REA for engineering (ORFE) a couple days ago but a question has been in my mind literally 24/7 since then. \n\nIs it possible to survive the course rigor at Princeton if I don't have much engineering experience? I've taken classes like Physics, Chem, Calc bc, and some Edx courses, but still feel like I don't know nearly as much as I should going in as an engineering student. Most of my ec's were not engineering related or were geared towards the hard sciences. I didn't do robotics either (which I regret a lot).",

You spend most of freshman year completing prerequisites/basic requirements, and they don\u2019t require background knowledge in your chosen concentration. Whatever engineering experience people have coming in doesn\u2019t matter for engineering courses nearly as much as aptitude and eagerness to learn the subjects. Plus the HS conception of \u201eengineering\u201c is overwhelmingly MAE/robotics topics, which aren\u2018t going to be particularly essential to ORFE, *unless* you want to pursue it as a certificate or side academic interest. Protip is see if you can take an ORFE departmental or something before declaring your concentration so that you know what you\u2019re getting into. That helped me immensely for CBE.",

In addition to what everyone else has said, it\u2019s worth pointing out that no matter what your intentions were when you applied, you can do anything you want when you get here! Princeton hasn\u2019t accepted you as a specific major or even A.B. vs engineering, so you can stick with ORFE or pick anything else you want. \n\nI\u2019d actually say the majority of engineers here haven\u2019t come in with a significant engineering background. For most people it\u2019s the usual combination of high school math and sciences. Calc BC already puts you in a good position, and certainly most kids haven\u2019t taken robotics specifically (which doesn\u2019t matter unless you\u2019re MAE/ECE anyway). You\u2019ll be fine.",

Also, I feel it may be getting saturated? But that\u2019s just hearsay on my part\n\nHonestly, your odds are still very small to get in either way. Questbridge offers a very unique ability through it\u2019s match program, as well as fee waivers and other benefits (if you\u2019re a QB scholar). Although these schools\u2019 financial aid packages are catching up to the point Questbridge may be less significant in coming years, I\u2019d still say if you can get matched to a school, go for it. Regular decision will always be an option, but the chance for a guaranteed free ride won\u2019t",

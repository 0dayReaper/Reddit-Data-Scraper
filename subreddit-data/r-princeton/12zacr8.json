Maybe going to a Walmart or even across the border into Pennsylvania may help you save some money.\n\nThe country is also dealing with inflation and a very possible recession.\n\nAmazon has slashed jobs.  Other companies have laid off to help their bottom line.\n\nYou may be able to help yourself by looking for grants or scholarships, however I don't have any experience in that.",

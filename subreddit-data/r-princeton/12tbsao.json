    "postText": "COS bse prefrosh here: I've heard that a lot of bse students are stressed, sleep deprived, and have no free time (this is sort of the sense I got from Preview). Is this true generally/for COS? If it is, would going AB route help at all? And is there a toxic  workaholic culture of bragging about or being valued by the amount of time you spend studying?\n\nthanks",

            "comment": "TLDR: workload can be stressful at times but definitely not overwhelming usually. BSE students still have time to do fun things. No (or very little) toxic workaholic culture.\n\nI\u2019m general, the average BSE student will probably spend more time studying than the average AB student. However, as a current sophomore in COS BSE (switched from MAE earlier this semester), I can say that the workload is not overwhelming for most students. Obviously, you\u2019re probably going to be stressed sometimes by work, but I (and all BSE kids ik) rarely find it extremely overwhelming. In fact, I and most of my BSE friends usually have time to chill and have some fun on weekends and some weekday nights and still maintain a 3.8+ GPA.\n\nAs for COS BSE vs COS AB, I don\u2019t think that will change your workload much because you still have to take roughly the same fundamental classes. \n\nRegarding your second question, there is def not a workaholic culture where people brag about how much they study here. Going further, students aren\u2019t very competitive in general. Everyone supports one another.\n\nKeep in mind tho that everyone is different, so there are prob some (tho I haven\u2019t met any) students who feel the opposite. It\u2019s hard to tell how YOU specifically will feel until you actually experience it. A lot of it also comes down to time management and prioritization.",

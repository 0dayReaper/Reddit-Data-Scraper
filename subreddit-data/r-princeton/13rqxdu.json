Club was Alpha Delta Phi. I did read on this sub that frats, despite not being recognized, are feeders to eating clubs.",

I am talking from an outsiders perspective cuz my roommates are in a frat and really enjoy it. As for your original question: I don\u2019t believe any of the frats are directly tied to any eating club. However being in a frat will definitely help get you into certain eating clubs. Specific frats feed into specific eating clubs. However you don\u2019t need to be in a frat to join an eating club.",

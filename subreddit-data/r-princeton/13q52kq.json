I know some programs (engineering stuff especially) are rly hard to run on MacOS.\nI\u2019ve always used Windows but kind of want to switch to Mac\u2014unless it\u2019s gonna impede my learning/be a pain. \nHowever, my Dells have always been finicky and had issues. And Macs seem to be much more reliable and sturdy.\nI have enough budgeted for a decent MacBook Pro, so cost for a windows laptop isn\u2019t super important.\n\nThanks.",

Can\u2019t think of a single time it was an issue and sometimes it was an advantage over Windows, e.g.,  for clusters as mentioned below.\n\nActually, as someone now in tech, there are many plenty of Macs used in industry too. All of my roles have used Macs, although I could have opted for a Windows machine if I wanted. If you want to switch to Mac, I\u2019d say go for it.",

Most of the COS/ECE classes I took actually had you using applications on clusters so it was nicer to go though a Mac honestly. But either will work, choose what you\u2019re most comfortable with.",

You're going to be writing scripts for the clusters/servers that are all running linux and writing/testing is much easier on a Mac with a proper terminal than Windows. Yes, yes I know Windows has a Ubuntu kernel/shell but it's an afterthought that feels like a virtual machine.",

The only exception I'd say would be that some opt for Linux machines, but in either scenario, using Macs or Linux for development is pretty similar. The Mac just offers a lot of other usability niceties that you typically don't get on a Linux machine (along with higher cost!). I'd avoid a Windows machine, however.",

You can get by fine with Windows if you're used to it, which is what I did, but if you like using macs more then definitely go for one.",

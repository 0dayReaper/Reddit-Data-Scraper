    "postText": "Hey y'all,\n\nI am currently about 10 minutes off campus in Princeton, and I cannot for the life of me find any good food anywhere that's not a restaurant. All the Googling I've done just shows me expensive sit-down places and breweries. I don't want to spend $20 on a single meal.\n\nAre there no small restaurants next to sketchy liquor stores with really good take-out food like the rest of the country around here? It can't be all restaurants and hoagies... right?",

McCaffrey's and Whole Earth are in/near downtown Princeton and have salad bars/delis/other hot-cold options. if you have access to a car, a trip down Route 1 opens up many more possibilities.",

But a Rolex store a walk away from a Polo Ralph Lauren a walk away from Lululemon a walk away from a jeweler a walk away from so many expensive restaurants all on what\u2019s supposed to be the artery of the city; really?\n\nIt\u2019s not like I can\u2019t afford to spend $20 on meals when I eat out, but to be able to afford and to be able to justify are two different things, and it just seems so pretentious to have a town centered around people justifying spending money at all these expensive stores and restaurants.",

Some cheaper quick options (e.g., Qdoba) went out of business during COVID... \n\nI think WaWa sandwiches are great. Hoagie Haven is not terrible. You can get a couple slices at pizza den for less than ten bucks. The box lunches at Nassau street seafood are pretty decent $11-14, and sandwiches about the same. These are nearer to equad which is closer walking wise for me so.",

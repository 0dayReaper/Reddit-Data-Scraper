    "postText": "So I committed to Princeton via the form on the applicant portal yesterday (!!!!) but just wanted to double check that Princeton *does not* require a deposit for incoming freshmen. On the reply to admission form it states that \"No deposit is required\" but I felt I should make sure. Just a bit paranoid as classmates who are going to peer institutions have had to put down deposits at their respective universities.",

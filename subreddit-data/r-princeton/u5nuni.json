    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI am interested in applying for Princeton 2022-2023 cycle. For international applicants, did you submit all of your high school internal grades + actual igcse, a level grades or just the actual grades for igcse and a level is sufficient? I understand that showing that you take variety of courses is important and I believe this can be seen in your igcse grades. Students here typically complete their igcse and a levels at different schools and we don't really have the grades formatted into a transcript, but rather grades in separated reports.",

Then I submitted my A level mock grades for midterm grades. Honestly, I don't think they're that fussed though, submit what makes you look good (for example predicted grades are likely to be a grade higher than your actual year 12 summer grades, at least in my school they are)",

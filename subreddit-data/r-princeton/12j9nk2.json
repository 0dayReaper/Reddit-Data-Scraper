Thank you!",

The people who I know who are super into CS theory actually are mostly from math/applied math undergrad degrees, but Princeton grad school is very math-skewed in general so this may not be widely applicable. \n\nThere are various certificates you can do here like ML that will teach you more specific theory stuff regardless of major.",

I originally applied to an engineering major (BSE) and I\u2019m now A.B! \n\nI would totally recommend exploring different classes if/when you get a Princeton, and seeing the different options to decide what your major would ultimately be. COS offers so many different pathways and lots of experienced profs. ORFE is well regarded and has solid career options but as far as I know you do need to take the BSE pre-reqs for ORFE which a lot of people don\u2019t love to do in freshman and sophomore years.",

    "postText": "I am looking for housing in the Princeton area for a summer internship from May to August 2023. \n\nWhat are some websites where I can look for some leases or house rentals? So far I've looked at Princeton university off-campus housing and Airbnb. PU off campus housing has options but mostly requiring PU affiliation. Airbnb is expensive and the distances to commute are long.",

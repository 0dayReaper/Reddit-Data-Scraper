So no, the two statements do not contradict each other. As far as I'm aware the civil rights act does not forbid the existence of systemically racist structures, only discrimination which is a small piece of the overall thing that is racism. The fact is that princeton is not really any more racist that almost every other school in this sense, and that the DoE is only going after Princeton because they've admitted that it's a problem. I think this is a tactic to try and bully institutions into not talking about racism, because the DoE and the trump administration in general want to pretend racism doesn't exist.",

Usually a couple of stripes..  one... race neutral laws that are targeted at the behavior of an ethnic group.  For instance these people allege it about drug laws targetting certain race based social classes.  This one is a problem because there are some cultural practices that society rightfully forbid but some say even that is racist..  two... the pure original sin model.  Our laws and rules were made by sinful racist people which makes the whole process and product one of intrinsic racism.\n\nSome say you can decolonize things... usually this means get rid of things that maintain the status quo because it only props up the system and its racism.  In the end this means being what power isn't so they then define what power is to suit their own goals.  Usually some form of racial revenge, permanent revolution, and/or communism.\n\nThis all gets down to critical theory whose purpose is to deconstruct the current culture to only leave what the theorist wants as the only option left.  It is a form of social demoralization.\n\nNow this does not mean there aren't problems.  Of course there are problems... but these are the ideas people fighting these problems are using and they are dreadful.\n\nIn either case anybody against systemic racism when they know what it means wants to shuck down the entire system like an ear of corn and rebuild the edifice from scratch... most theorists know they don't want to go that far because they like their own cultural and technological trappings... but they'll burn a lot outside of that",

Discrimination is pools putting up signs that say \"no blacks allowed\". Systemic racism is the fact that fewer black children learn to swim because their parents weren't allowed in public pools back when outright discrimination did happen, and their parents, who never learned to swim, can't teach them. Just because the highly visible discrimination is no longer happening, that doesn't mean we don't see its effects to this day. Princeton is admitting that traces of past outright racist systems and other such examples of systemic racism do still exist on campus just as they exist in every fiber of american society, and this administration is trying to punish them for admitting that.",

Your example of systemic racism that doesn't include racial discrimination still requires racial discrimination for it to function. Perhaps you could come up with a better example?\n\nPrinceton isn't saying that there still exists an undercurrent of racism that permeates all of society, they are saying that the their systems - the systems which Princeton is responsible for and that are fully within their power to change - are racist.

Any university that still employs racist systems should not be funded.\n\n&gt;No, it required past racial discrimination. It requires zero racist intent today - the racist effect will persist nonetheless unless an effort is made to rectify it.\n\nThat makes more sense. However, I'm still of the opinion that funding should be withheld until whatever systemically racist policies the university has are changed. It is fully within the power and authority of the university officials to change their systems so that they are no longer racist.\n\nFurthermore, just because something does not *intentionally* discriminate doesn't mean that there is no racial discrimination. To me it seems like you're saying that past intentional racial discrimination leads to current unintentional racial discrimination but the discrimination is there all the same. Any system which disproportionately affects students of a particular race, even unintentionally, is causing racial discrimination.\n\n&gt;This is not the message I got from the letter at all, and I am in fact quite surprised that anyone could read the letter in this way.\n\nHow would you interpret the letter? To me it seems like Princeton, in their own financial interests, are trying to avoid losing funding over something that they themselves have admitted to. \n\n&gt;\"Systemic racism\" is not equivalent to \"explicitly codified racial prejudice\". It is typically used to refer to the racist outcomes that arise from systems or institutions that were designed without explicitly racist intent. \n\nYes, this is something I agree with.

                            "comment": "Federal Civil Right laws require universities to adhere to certain requirements (e.g. no racial discrimination) in order to receive federal funding.\n\nHowever, Federal Civil Rights laws **do not** outlaw systemic racism.  So Princeton itself benefits from \"not being racist\" (per Civil Rights laws) while still actually getting to be \"systemically racist\".  It's a win-win for Princeton, since the goal of the university as a system is to maintain itself, i.e. it started out systemically racist and the institution's goal is to maintain itself as a systemically racist institution.\n\nOf course you can see that by not outlawing systemic racism, U.S. Federal Civil Rights laws are, in and of themselves, systemically racist, since allowing the perpetuation of systemically racist organizations (including but not limited to, universities, city and state governments, law enforcement organizations and labor unions) is of course, not just systemically racist, but actually explicitly racist.  (Anything that is explicitly racist is as a matter of course systemically racist.)\n\nSince the U.S. Civil Rights laws are explicitly racist, it follows that the organization that created the laws, the Federal Government itself, is also explicitly racist.\n\nOne of the magical thing about systemic racism is that it's the system that racist, not the people.  So politicians that run city governments, even Democrats, get co-opted by the system and become racist themselves, *even if they are POC*!  \n\nAnother magical thing is the politicians themselves can't be held responsible for the racist results of the systemically racist government.  They are powerless to change or reform the system.  The system *can't* be changed or reformed, it can only be \"burned to the ground\" (I'm speaking figuratively here of course!) and replaced by a non-systemically racist system.\n\nThis explains the calls to defund the police.  The goal is to eliminate police departments that are ipso facto systemically racist and replace this \"system\" with a new, non-systemically racist system.  That's why it is actually good (just to provide a real life example) that a female POC police chief was forced to resign in Seattle.\n\nThere is a problem though.  There is a fundamental principle in the US that governmental organizations only exist \"with the consent of the governed\".  I'm pretty sure this concept is considered systemically racist itself, though I haven't done the work to understand how.  But at any rate, there are too many citizens that believe in this illusion.  This leads us to the inescapable conclusions:\n\n1. Society itself is systemically racist.  Otherwise it would not have produced institutions that are systemically racist.\n2. Replacing systemically racist institutions cannot be done with the consent of the governed (since the governed are the source of the systemic racism) and the governed do not want them replaced.\n3. Therefore, replacing systemically racist institutions can only be done though the use of force.  They must be imposed on a population that is not willing to do the work of replacing the systemically racist institutions itself.\n\nWith that explanation out of the way, I can tell you that there is actually one international organization that is **not** systemically racist. And while it does advocate for the simultaneous violent overthrow of all current governments on the planet to put an end to systemic racism once and for all (not to mention many other problems humans experience) under a single world government, it does know that this is only possible via the intervention of extra-terrestrial forces.  So that organization itself is not actually engaged in the process of violence itself, its members content to tell others about the inevitable coming change in world governance and advocating for everyone to support the incoming world government.",

                            "comment": "A few ways, off the top of my head:\n\n1) Systemic racism that affects students' academic lives before they get to university- some students will have caregiving responsibilities or things affecting their lives that muddle our ability to accurately measure their academic potential. A brilliant student who spends all of their free time caring for sick relatives will test a lot different from one who has dedicated tutors hired to help them do well on tests. These factors affect students way before they get to Princeton\n\n2) Systems that exist at Princeton that the university or even explicit perpetrators aren't aware of. Harvard's Project Implicit is one of the biggest ongoing psychology experiments in the world, and they've pretty consistently shown that most people have unconscious biases that lead them to prejudicing against certain groups. Making yourself aware of those biases is a good thing, because it helps you consciously overcome them- we should focus on growing out of these biases rather than condemning that they previously existed, since they're common societally\n\n3) A lot of these systems come down to social dynamics or hierarchies of power that the university doesn't explicitly control. Students who feel like their opinions won't be taken seriously in class will be marginalized or pressured into not behaving like other students, even if the university doesn't actively tell them that their opinions aren't valid. This is why representation is so important to people- it gives people from historically marginalized groups a reason to believe that when they voice their opinions in an academic setting, people will actually pay attention. But the creation and maintenance of the environment that marginalized those people didn't require any actual actions by the university- it's much more environmental than that. In fact, these environments often persist in spite of organizations explicitly arguing that they support the voices of marginalized peoples- if somebody exists in a wider society that doesn't take your opinion seriously, I understand why that person would continue feeling that way when they move to a slightly different environment that's still a part of the society.\n\n4) I think the definition of \"racist\" gets lost a lot here, mostly since that word is very charged. Racism isn't just overtly discriminatory acts, but also (as I alluded to above) systems that perpetuate discrimination in society. Identifying that parts of society perpetuate this racism isn't an indictment- it's necessary self-awareness that can direct us towards actually rectifying that discrimination. Systemic racism isn't always a set of overt actions that people do because they hate minorities or like oppressing people, so our response to it shouldn't be to condemn newfound self-awareness. Acknowledgement of racist structures is not racist, and since many of those structures were unconscious or part of wider societies, we should focus on how we can fix those structures and not on placing blame for them.\n\nWith the big caveat, of course, that overt racism does still exist. If the university openly knows that a practice is discriminatory and engages in it anyways with the intent of marginalizing certain groups of people, we shouldn't assume good faith. But as I understand it, nobody has accused Princeton of this sort of overt discrimination, so much as Princeton has acknowledged that the university exists within a society that has systemic discrimination in it.\n\nHope that makes sense.",

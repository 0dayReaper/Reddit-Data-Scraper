    "postText": "Hi all! I\u2019m a new BSE admit to Princeton. I was wondering\u2014how do placement tests work with AP? \n\nSpecifically, I\u2019m looking to test out with STEM classes (like AP CS A and Chemistry) and humanities classes (like Macro/Microeconomics). \n\nIf I obtain 5s on these exams (or exams in general), does that mean I can automatically skip their equivalent courses? Or would I still have to take a placement exam?\n\nThank you so much!",

            "comment": "\n\nYou can take any placement exam offered. A placement exam is enough to place out of a prereq class, granted you perform well enough. \n\n\nPlacing out of classes using AP scores is more department-specific. The physics department, for instance, requires you to take the placement test irrespective of a 5 on the physics c exams. The math dept allows you to use your calculus BC score and self select your courses. Most of the classes don't take AP credit, unfortunately. You should check out this year's page for your specific courses: https://odoc.princeton.edu/advancedplacement",

Based on some googling i think different placement exams are at different times of the year. I've been told that all this info is conveyed over the summer, so I suppose best would be to wait for it.",

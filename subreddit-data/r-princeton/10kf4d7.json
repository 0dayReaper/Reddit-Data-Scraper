    "postText": "Coucou friends! \n\nI'm a PDA who just started in the Molecular Biology department and it is my first time in the US. I'm looking for long term housing in Princeton, ideally within 1h walk from campus. I can move in as soon as 1st of February (and as late as 13th of February). It can be a studio, a small apartment or a room in a shared apartment (preferably 420 friendly, but not a deal breaker).\nI'm laid back and like to keep clean but not compulsively. I have been previously described as a godsend by ex roommates from Paris and Amsterdam, when it comes to keeping the living space presentable.\nPlease reach out to me at pu1616@princeton.edu or DM here if you are interested in subletting/leasing or know someone who might.\nThanks for reading!",

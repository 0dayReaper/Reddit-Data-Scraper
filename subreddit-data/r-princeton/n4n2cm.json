    "postText": "Hi everyone, so I just got in off the waitlist yesterday and I'm very excited! I'm trying to decide if I should go here or to Stanford so I wanted to ask a couple of questions that didn't have to do with Princeton's academic side.\n\n- What's the party scene here like? What about dating?\n- How easy is it to find your group of friends?\n- Is the \"snobby/elitist\" rich-kid stereotype true?\n- What is it like for a first-gen/low income student here? \n- How large have your classes been? Is it harder to form connections with professors? (I guess that is an academic question lol)\n- How easy is it to take classes outside of your major? Is it pretty flexible?\n- Are student clubs /extracurriculars selective? \n- What is it like if you choose not to join an eating club?\n- Would you say most students are more laid-back back or serious? \n\nI'm kinda leaning towards Stanford at the moment just because of their student life, but I know Princeton would be better career-wise and there's a lot of things I like about it. Please help!",

            "comment": "Speaking as a first gen student who who was painfully quiet in high school and then went to Princeton and realized I was an extrovert and actually liked being around people similar to me lol.  \n\nI know nothing about the social life at Stanford.  I would say, pick the school for your major and less for the social scene.  \n\n1. Party scene is mostly on campus.  The upside is that you will not need a fake ID and just need to get to know a few upperclassmen to get into parties.  It helps to join a club/extracurricular to get passes to some clubs that require passes! \nDating: From my experience, a lot of people pair off into couples freshman fall and they either graduate and get married (lot of my friends are engaged now) or they break it off a few years later to date/hookup with other people lol. \n\n2. You\u2019re split up into Zee groups freshman year and a lot of people find their best friends through this.  Mine are through my extracurricular and a couple from class study groups. \n\n3-4. I am a first gen student but with the caveat that I was able to get enough financial aid that I only had to work part time.  I did not feel that it impacted my experience at all.  There was a first gen low income network that was started when I was there.  I still had time to play a 3 season sport and attend classes/ have social life.  \nI think there are definitely students that come from elite backgrounds but the ones I met in class were just like any other student.  I\u2019m sure there are exceptions.  You can really pick and choose who you hang out with. \n\n5.  Class size depends on your major.  Intro classes were typically large with smaller (10-15 person) precepts.  Upper level classes were small.  My advice is to go to office hours and talk to the professors like they are your friends! I always felt so intimidated by them and it\u2019s harder to build a relationship if you don\u2019t make an effort to get to know them as individuals (in addition to being experts in their field). \n\n6.  Yeah some clubs can be selective bc everyone is so talented.  Some of the most highly sought after dance/a cappella groups are tough to get into.  But there are always less selective options depending on your interests. \n\n7.  Yes it\u2019s easy to take classes outside your major as long as you meet the prerequisites for it.  Princeton requires a bunch of classes in different areas as part of the degree.  It\u2019s slightly less flexible for engineers.  \n\n8.  I was independent for a semester and did not enjoy it because I didn\u2019t really have a group of other independent friends.  I ended up bickering later and joining an eating club.  If you choose to not join an eating club, I\u2019ve had friends who had a great time rooming with other independents in Housing with a kitchen or joining a co-op.  \n\n9.  It\u2019s a mix. There are a lot of ambitious students pushing for med school/law school/phds.  I was pretty relaxed. \n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any other questions.",

While Princeton would be better connected to the finance and consulting on the East Coast. But honestly you should do fine coming out of either school!\n\nMy social life at Princeton was pretty awesome and academia feeling was pretty strong.",

            "comment": "* What's the party scene here like? What about dating?\n\nOn campus. Pretty snobby. I only dated people on other campuses because the dating scene at Princeton was everything you hated in high school dialed to 1000. I saw more alcoholism than I ever thought I would there, it was depressing as someone with substance abuse in their family I felt really turned off by the social scene and its tolerance for excess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* How easy is it to find your group of friends?\n\nI found my best friend in the world in my RA group. Otherwise, pieced together based on mutual interests and being outcasts from the larger more popular ways to pass time on weekends like... drinking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Is the \"snobby/elitist\" rich-kid stereotype true?\n\nAs  token poor kid, yeah, it was rubbed in my face routinely that I didn't have a car, dress preppy enough, have a good computer... it was unpleasant explaining why I couldn't afford a ski trip to Vail or a summer vacay to Europe because, well, I had to work on vacations to be able to return.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* What is it like for a first-gen/low income student here?\n\nAs a first gen college student from a lower middle class existence, I would not have made the choice to go here in retrospect knowing what I know now. I worked several jobs because I had parents who made just enough to not qualify for a lot of aid but not enough to make my college experience comfortable and affordable even with scholarships.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* How large have your classes been? Is it harder to form connections with professors? (I guess that is an academic question lol)\n\nI can't say I bonded closely with too many professors. Largest classes were intro courses, my profs couldn't pick me out of a lineup in those courses. Later on I had better experiences in smaller classes as a junior and senior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* How easy is it to take classes outside of your major? Is it pretty flexible?\n\nWith some planning it is not hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Are student clubs /extracurriculars selective?\n\nMany are. A capella groups are very selective.  I didn't have much time for activities outside of work but was an officer at my eating club senior year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* What is it like if you choose not to join an eating club?\n\nI joined an eating club and can only comment on that experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Would you say most students are more laid-back back or serious?\n\nWeird combo of laid back but would stab you in the back if they found out it would advance them somehow to do so, because it happened to me and friends often enough I learned not to really trust people outside my closest friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know about Stanford, but I wouldn't recommend my experience. My academic advisor was an abusive, racist trash human being. Aside from a few good friends I don't have any relationship with people from that part of my life, not a lot of good memories. Your mileage may vary, but if I had it to do again, I probably would have chosen another institution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, and career wise, I ended up where I wanted but not because of P-ton, my advisor (trash human, see above) wrote terrible letters or recommendation and only found out after the fact when people commented how bad his letters were. So I succeeded largely on accomplishments after P-ton not during.",

I don\u2019t drink, hate snobby people, and mostly keep to myself. In other words, it appears that I wouldn\u2019t belong here, but I actually enjoyed my experience at Princeton.\n\nThe truth is that everyone here is a snake, manipulator, and a good liar. That\u2019s how we all got here. However, Princeton breaks many people as freshmen and takes away that layer revealing a nice soft and welcoming interior. Unfortunately this doesn\u2019t happen with every one, so if someone is being toxic, ignore them entirely. Find people you are comfortable with; be above negativity; construct your own circles. That\u2019s one thing that Princeton has taught me.",

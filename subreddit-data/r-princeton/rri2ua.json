I myself tried it and dropped after Week 3 (in Fall 2021, 36 students signed up, 26 remained after the swap period ended, and only 20 students signed up for the spring semester). The fall semester of ISC includes 10-15 hour long psets every week that'll require you to think differently than you would in an AP Physics C or AP Chem class and 10-15 hour long lab reports every two weeks on topics such as Reynold's Number, building a Solar Cell, and Brownian Motion. There is a lot of emphasis on utilizing Calculus in all the sciences, \"thinking like a scientist,\" and most students in the class are Physics and COS majors interested in applying Physics and COS to Biology (aka Quantitative and Computational Biology), etc. If you do stick with ISC, you'll have a demanding but potentially rewarding experience. All in all, take at your own risk.",

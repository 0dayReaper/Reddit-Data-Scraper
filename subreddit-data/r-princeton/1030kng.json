    "postText": "Ahoyhoy all, \n\nI'm a PDA starting in the Molecular Biology department, and I'm looking for temporary housing in Princeton to gather my bearings while aie find my own place to call home, from 13 January until 13 February (exit date flexible). It can be a studio, a small apartment or a room in a shared apartment, as long as it got enough place for a mattress and three giant suitcases,\u00a0 I'm down. \nPlease reach out to me if you are interested in subletting your place or know somebody who might.\nThanks!",

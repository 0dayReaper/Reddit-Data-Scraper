    "postText": "A few years ago, when Conway was still alive, I was studying calculus in Fine Hall. Those of you who knew him probably know he liked to hang around there near the second floor study rooms, where he'd hobble along with his cane and grab his coffee in the mornings. \n\nOn this particular morning I also wanted some coffee as he was preparing his own. So I walked over to the coffee machine.\n\nConway hadn't realized someone had come so close to him. As he turned around, coffee in hand, I startled him, and some of his steaming hot coffee splashed onto his hand.\n\n\"Boggart!\" he screamed. I was too taken aback in panic at my mortifying sin to offer him help. I had directly caused an old person to suffer pain. And not just any old person at that - this was John Conway. I am not even a mere mosquito on the windshield of mathematical history, and here I had just caused this titan grievous pain - without really having done anything at all. \n\nLord have mercy on me. RIP Conway.",

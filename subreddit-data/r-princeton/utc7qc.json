    "postText": "I am doing an exchange at Princeton next semester. I have heard that if one selects upperclassman housing, there might be a kitchen, or not. Since I'm on a diet, I'd like to cook for myself at least half of the time. Is that possible? Also, I've heard about co-opts, how does that work? Can exchange students be part of a co-opt?",

You should specify to housing that you want to be placed in a building with a kitchen.\n\nSpelman is not part of upperclass housing proper, so I doubt that\u2019s an option for you. Don\u2019t know if exchange students can join co-ops, but I\u2019m sure you can email the co-ops and ask.",

Depending on your dietary constraints though a co-op might not be right for you... the idea is that everyone cooks a dish once a week for the entire co-op to ease the burden of cooking and also have a small community to eat/socialize with. You could use their kitchen at off hours but that's not really the point of joining! https://odus.princeton.edu/odus-programs/dining-eating-clubs-and-co-ops",

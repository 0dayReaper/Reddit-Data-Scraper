    "postText": "Hello all, just wanted to make a few comments as a current FGLI student and shoot down some of u/Not-gerrymandering 's incorrect information.\n\nHere is the original message from their previous post retyped as they deleted it:\"The FSI scam that everyone was suggesting was a scam as usual. It was $3500 for two classes during the summer for everyone fucking year. This funding this year, however, was a fucking meme of $350. WTF. Like actually wtf. Why target poor kids. I already don't want to be here and will likely end up like the other two people who offed themselves this past week if I go.\n\nI mean fuck. Why? Am i the asshole here? Yale is giving over $1k for their comparable summer program shit and Stanford, etc are probably much more. So Why? I am in hell.\"\n\nLet's do a cost breakdown right now of going to Princeton versus Yale for example. Yale's program actually only gives a $250 stipend. The number that they are quoting is reflective of the \"summer savings contribution\", which Princeton got rid of years ago because it disproportionately affected low-income students.\n\nBeyond this, EFC 0 students at Yale still have to pay $1,600 every year unless, unless they do fsy (which only waives this cost in the first year). On the other hand, Princeton requires zero student contribution for the entirety of the education if you're EFC 0.\n\nIf you're curious as to why students previously received a larger stipend, but are receiving a lower one now, that is because that $3500 is ONLY reflective of the stipend over COVID. Students who took FSI over COVID had to take it from home, so this was to offset housing, books, and meal costs. However, at FSI in-person, there are 3-meals a day provided, a dorm room, and all educational resources covered. You are getting PAID to get taught two separate courses, which furthers your own educational career. Princeton is an educational institution, not a full-time job. Their focus is not to make you wealthy, it's to educate you. Be grateful about this, many FLI students have to pay and go into debt for such an experience.\n\nGoing further, the user also made this comment (here is an excerpt):\n\n\"THE ONLY REASON PEOPLE COME HERE IS THE FUCKING MONEY... WHY DOES EVERY . FUCKING. OTHER. IVY. CARE FOR THEIR FUCKING STUDENTS.\"\n\nI genuinely don't understand this point. Princeton is marketed as an educational institution, and I would wager a larger part of the fame of Princeton is around the ideals and education than the money (although I do not discredit the large endowment to student ratio is beneficial to the educational opportunities). An educational institution's job is to educate you, not pay you a full-time wage to go to the school. I can't really understand the privileged position this person is in, as they feel entitled to such an experience. I will say this as a matter of fact, NO school is going to give you the experience you seek. At MIT, at Yale, at any other school you will not be catered too as if you are some expensive commodity. They are giving you the opportunity of upward mobility, do you not see this?\n\nSorry for the long message all, but I thought I ought to publicly address some of this person's comments to give a full perspective to any other FGLI student who intend to come here. This person's experience is NOT representative of the truth. I am an FGLI student, I applied through Questbridge, and my experience as Princeton is not perfect. However, Princeton's FGLI resources have provided me the opportunity to be on a level playing field with students with significantly more preparation than I. I went to a school where they did not even teach Calculus, but I am able to go through the Physics curriculum because FSI gave me a head start.\n\nAnd one could argue that if to utilize these resources I must sacrifice my mental health due to difficulty to gain access to these resources / terrible staff, I would understand. However, this is not the case at Princeton. The staff at the Emma Bloomberg Center for Access and Inclusion (EBCAO) are some of the best people I have met in my entire life, and they will go leaps and bounds to make sure you have everything you want.\n\nHowever, there is a difference between being an FGLI student who needs to lean on EBCAO for support, and someone who feels entitled to it all. This student does, and their actions and posts point to this. Do not trust what they say.  \n\n\nEdit: Grammar",

As a first gen alum whose education was heavily, heavily subsidized by financial aid, I was getting worried we were falling behind other peer schools / had issues but couldn\u2019t find anything else. \n\n\nI know we still have a long way to go in making Princeton accessible for everyone but appreciate you sharing that it isn\u2019t as dire as others make it seem. \n\nGood luck with the rest of your Princeton career! It\u2019ll fly by. \ud83d\udc05",

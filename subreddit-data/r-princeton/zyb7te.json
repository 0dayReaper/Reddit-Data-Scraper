    "postText": "I have a conference to go to in January (20th) at Princeton, and my flight gets into Philly at around 9:30am. I know (?) that the Dinky can take me from Princeton Junction to where I am staying, but am at a bit of a loss for how to get from the airport to PJ. Amtrak does not have any trains that will get me there on time, and I heard from someone in the area to look into the SEPTA lines, but I guess I can't navigate the site well enough to figure out a route. Any help would be much appreciated!",

The only substitution I would make is Ubering from Trenton to where you are staying in Princeton. It will save you 2 trains and not cost a whole lot more.",

It\u2019s like an hour drive, so it\u2019ll save 1-2hrs of travel time and with taking a car from PHL to 30th, SEPTA, then another Uber\u2026 it\u2019s not like you\u2019re saving tons and tons of money.

Looks like you'd probably have to take 2 SEPTA trains too and change in 30th St. station. \n\nAs for the NJ Transit part of the trip, that's pretty simple. Just get any northbound northeast corridor train from Trenton.",

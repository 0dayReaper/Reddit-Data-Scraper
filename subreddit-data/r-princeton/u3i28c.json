Protecting free speech should not protect hate speech, and the conservative bogeyman of a censored book-burning left is entirely unfounded. I find this article pretty unconvincing.",

I don't know if it's a misunderstanding of the \"systemic\" part of it or a weak attempt to distract by pointing at good things, but whatever it is, it's not actually addressing the point. In one of the linked articles written by the same author, he points out that systemic racism at Princeton may be a function of influences from schools outside of Princeton- somehow managing to take an argument demonstrating wider inequalities and using it to argue that we \\*shouldn't\\* take a systemic view that considers structural inequalities?",

It could be that Katz said a dumb thing he couldn\u2019t defend, and was correctly told his ideas were worthless. Academia is the process of discussing ideas, so we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by mechanisms to discard bad ideas.",

The claims in the article that the university is somehow seeking to damage his reputation seem a bit weak to me in light of how his suspension for three separate allegations of sexual harassment were written off as a \"sabbatical\" at the time.",

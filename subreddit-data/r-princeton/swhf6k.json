    "postText": "Hey Tigers! \n\nI've just accepted a PhD place at Princeton, and was curious to hear if anyone has any advice about what to expect from Princeton. By that, I mean, is there anything that's good to be aware of with Princeton that will help with settling in? Or anything that I should make sure to do on arrival in Princeton?\n\nI'm coming from the UK, so if there's any specific advice that helps people from the UK (not sure that there would be, but asking just in case), that would also be great to hear!\n\nThanks! Go Tigers!",

I personally know every first year from the UK this year, so I'm sure other people are bound to figure out who you are. Just a word of advice.",

            "comment": "congratulations! oh hey, I am a UK-er doing a phd at P-ton. i can't think of anything in particular. princeton is really well resourced, generally you can find things if you ask for them. folks from the UK are often a bit more diffident, but it's worth asking if you can. people often don't like living in the grad college, I never did, but I'd recommend getting out of that if you can. lakeside is nicer than lawrence. \n\ni would recommend throwing yourself into life in the US; it's a fantastic country even though a lot of folks in the UK are quite negative. Princeton is kind of weirdly rural. like maybe a five minute drive will see you in fields and so forth. If you can afford it I would get a car; it is life changing and opens up so many freedoms. e.g. there are no grocery stores of much note in easy walking distance of central princeton, maybe there are buses that can get you there, but if you can get a car that will help hugely. to get a license you'll have to go to the dmv, sort of like the dvla except that its a physical building and there are tons of them. it's not super fun and it's fairly bureaucratic but as long as you're organized it's ok. \n\nmake sure you are on top of your immigration stuff, that can get you into big trouble if you do it wrong. but by and large just doing what they tell you and you'll be fine. \n\ni'm sure there are lots of other things, but generally it's pretty straightforwards and I'm sure you'll get the same advice from a bunch of different quarters :)",

Looking through the options, i was thinking one of the grad annexes could be a good shout, unless there's anything you think I should be aware of with those?\n\nThat's great advice on the car. I'll definitely have a think about getting some form of transport that lets me get out of Princeton's main town easily. \n\nGlad to hear you think it's straightforward! Thanks!",

I thought it would be fun to live in a house with folks, but people just stole everyone else\u2019s food and used stuff from others\u2019 shower caddies.  The annexes are similar to the GC in that the size and layout of your room is a total crapshoot and the individual rooms have keyless entry, meaning you have to remember to take your prox card with you every. Single. Time. You. Go. To. The. Bathroom. Getting locked outside of your room in a towel? Or after you get up to pee in the middle of the night? With no shoes, no clothes, and no way to contact campus safety? Never again. Try for Lakeside, Lawrence, or the off-campus housing.",

They seem to be a lot more expensive than the other graduate accommodation (and likewise with living off campus). Plus, they also seemed a bit removed from the rest of Princeton University. Are those assumptions correct?",

Princeton is itty bitty, so the walk from Lawrence to Nassau Street is almost precisely 1 mile and the walk to some parts of campus less than that. Plus the (free) bus comes quite frequently and I could get from home to office in &lt;7 minutes. Living off campus CAN be pricey, but those housing options can be super close to your department, in some cases practically across the street. \n\nKeep in mind you also have to be on a $meal plan$ if you\u2019re in the GC and it\u2019s recommended for Annex dwellers. GC and Annexes are going to be more affordable, but if you\u2019re not coming straight from undergrad and you\u2019ve had a taste of \u201creal world life\u201d beyond the college dorms, it can be rough transitioning back to dorm life.",

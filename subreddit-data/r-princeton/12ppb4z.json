            "comment": "The social aspect of Princeton is really good. You\u2019ll probably have a lab meeting once a week, your department will do a couple of socials every week, and the grad school itself also hosts socials. Depending on what kind of stuff you\u2019re interested in you could be going to 10+ socials a month. There are grad student orgs for various interests. And all of this isn\u2019t even mentioning your roommates (should you choose to live on campus). It\u2019s about as social as undergrad minus the frats, IMO. \n\nIn terms of what to do /where to go, on campus your options are pretty limited as there\u2019s only 1 street of stuff (Nassau). However most people know someone with a car and surrounding towns have a lot more places to go.",

Although there were plenty of social events as OC notes, they tend to have the same clusters of people, and I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ll have that much time to attend to social stuff (you are doing a PhD now after all).\n\nI\u2019d say that the social aspect of Princeton is surprisingly good given how small the town is and how separate the graduate/undergraduate students are. Don\u2019t expect anything more",

I think you just have to drive to them or know your way around on the public buses.\n\nI plan to take a trip up there to get a sense of what is where.  Google Maps can also be helpful because it has a feature to show you what is in the area.  I'm sure there are other shopping centers but I have to spend time looking at the map and explore.\n\nThere is another town called Pennington which I've driven to and shopped at before.\n\nI'll be calling NJ Transit as well.\n\nI plan on getting over there to look around and hopefully soon.",

The graduate college (castle on the hill where 1st year PhD students have the option to dorm) has a bar in the basement - the DBar. That\u2019s where most 1st and 2nd year PhD students hang out. The Graduate Student Government (GSG) also hosts ~4 large parties a year exclusively for graduate students. \n\nAside from those events, there are usually weekly departmental happy hours, happy hours in the Graduate College, and The Ivy bar on nassau street. \n\nYou can also join intramural sports and clubs as a graduate student. For example, a lot of departments have a softball team. That\u2019s a lot of fun.",

    "postText": "To any other Class of 2026 students who have other options, are other top schools this manic and stupid with just the campus visit policy?\n\nThere are 4 things that are humiliating:\n\n1 -- You need Mommy and Daddy to sign your permission slip to be allowed to visit campus for the programming events. Doesn't make any god-damn sense, cause you can visit campus on regularly without it.\n\nOh? You are 18+. Who gives a fuck. Here is your pacifier you baby.\n\n2-- They state in bold that  you are not allowed to leave the hotel grounds without a Parent's permission. Honestly wtf. You can literally get rescinded if you are found without Mommy. WTF.\n\n3-- One day event, cause you suck. Bulldog Days/Visitas/ Any other top school's visit program. have multiple days. Why the fuck is it one day?\n\n4-- If you need financial aid, your arm is twisted to a travel agency. Why? This is honestly just deliberately evil to break character for a moment. No other school is this fuckin' malicious and bizarre.",

            "comment": "I could be wrong but part of the reason this is probably in place is bc I believe there is a push for state governments and universities to change laws and regulations (and thus Princeton followed) regarding minors and high schoolers visiting campus ever since the Penn State Sandusky scandal/other sex abuse scandals happened about a decade ago. ODUS (Office of Dean of Undergraduate Students), when I was a student at Princeton, was in the process of updating a lot of the norms and regulations with student groups because of this and making things more strict. I don't know how relevant it has been recently due to covid kinda stopping a lot of events, but the new rules meant that you needed to have a school rep in any room at all times with students/hsers visiting and that you need to have like x number of people who have these certifications and anti child abuse certifications. There were also a lot more rules regarding permission slips and how they had to be explicit about the parents approving things regarding supervision. Events over a certain size now require special ODUS approval and IIRC may require having dedicated ODUS people staff the event because of it. In Pennsylvania it's extremely strict. A friend at Carnegie Mellon told me that on-campus events with high schoolers require that anyone in a room with any high schoolers, even if they are 18, had to get approved by the school using the state policy, which requires bloodwork and getting fingerprinted and having a criminal background check and re-doing this every 5 years.",

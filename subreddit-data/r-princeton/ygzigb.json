I agree with other folks that as you become a junior/senior, it would be good to build out a little more. \n\nFor instance, having another leadership role or two in the organizations you are in would be good, and I think maybe 2 more activities (whether a sport, other volunteering, job, arts group, building your own app or website, etc.). I would make sure though you frame them around what you\u2019re passionate about, not just checking boxes off a list. I\u2019m also not sure how much colleges value attending the Harvard summer programs, just as a flag. But defer to others / your experience if you\u2019ve heard otherwise. \n\nI would also say\u2026 there are a bunch of great colleges, and there\u2019s nothing that \u201cguarantees\u201d getting into any one \u2014 so make sure you\u2019re enjoying high school, developing passions, and learning a lot! That will set you up for success even if the exact college doesn\u2019t work out. \n\nGood luck!",

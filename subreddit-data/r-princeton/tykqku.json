            "comment": "the ivy bar is my favorite. a bit of a dive bar, but nice patio out back and cheap drinks. Really the fun atmosphere is what makes it great. for a more upscale bar, the dinky is good and their food is good. Lan ramen for lunch is great, I recommend the egg tomato ramen or the mapo tofu. Nomad pizza is good but annoying if you won't have a car. if youre into coffee, sakrid has the best but a lot of people might say small worlds is a princeton tradition",

Something like Yankee Doodle Tap Room at the Nassau Inn would be worth a visit. Ivy Inn and Alchemist and Barrister might also be worth a try. \n\nPrinceton is very small so there isn\u2019t a lot to choose from. If you have transport then Philly or NYC has many more options.",

There\u2019s a shortage of staff there(and everywhere else) but they\u2019re very friendly and accommodating. Agricola is a great farm-to-table restaurant. Elements is probably the best restaurant for me and it\u2019s the closest to a Michelin restaurant in the area but also very expensive. For cheap eats, Tacoria and Small Bites are great! I also agree that Sakrid probably has better coffee than Small World.",

    "postText": "Hello, everyone!\n\nExcited to be joining this subreddit!\n\nI am a Ph.D. student flying to Princeton next October as part of my studies, in Visiting Student Research Collaborator capacity, until June. Currently looking for a place to stay that is not crazy expensive (up until 1400-1500USD/month), but not sure where to start. Maybe some of you, living there, have tips on how to search or places to recommend? Not really looking to live in Princeton itself, as I reckon that nearby places (e.g., New Brunswick?) may be more financially viable, even if I have to commute every day. \n\nThank you in advance for all your help!\n\nHit me up if you want more details.\n\nCheers,\n\nFrancisco",

The average rental prices may only sample a biased sample of the housing market.  Their samples may only include their rental properties.  We are not from New Jersey and we wouldn't know any better.\n\nI wish you the best and may you have a safe and happy experience at Princeton.",

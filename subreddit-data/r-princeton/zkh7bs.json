    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all! So the REA decisions come out Thursday and I\u2019m getting super super nervous. Princeton is my top choice and I really want to get in, but I know Princeton is extremely picky with their acceptances, and I\u2019m starting to feel like I won\u2019t get in. \n\nMy grades are good, but that\u2019s basically everyone that applied, so I\u2019m mainly banking on how I\u2019ve been a varsity starter for the Boys Varsity Wrestling Team at my school even though I\u2019m one of the only girls for the past four years, my work experience (since I\u2019ve been working since I was 14 to help out my family), and that I want to major in a STEM field (Chemical Engineering). \n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I was not confident in my writing supplements at all, but I think my interview went really well.\n\nI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m starting to doubt if my qualifications are any good at all.\n\nPlease lmk what y\u2019all think, and you can be brutally honest, just tell it to me straight before I lose my mind LOL.\n\nEDIT: Got deferred :(. Not sure what to do next but I want to write a letter to the office of admissions that I\u2019m still very interested in Princeton. Is there anything required that I have to do? Like do I have to accept the offer or anything or just simply wait?",

Whether you get in or not is not really a reflection on you, I\u2019m sure you have passed that threshold of possibility, but the acceptance rate is so low it\u2019s kind of up to chance. \n\nThe most important thing is that while I\u2019m sure you would succeed at Princeton if you get I , I\u2019m even more confident you\u2019ll succeed wherever you end up as long as you are positive going into it and embrace the experience fully. The path ahead of you is long and winding, and all about what you make it. \n\nCertainly cheering you on to join the \ud83d\udc05 family, but cheering you on about the incredible years ahead of you, regardless of what this one decision result is, even more.",

It\u2019s unhealthy to base my worth on what happens on Thursday. But it\u2019s truly a lovely school, so my hopes are still high. Hope to join the family!",

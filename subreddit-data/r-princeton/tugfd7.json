    "postText": "I found out a couple days back that I got into Princeton class of 2026. I'm strongly considering it for obvious reasons (other option is Oxford University), but I was wondering what the trans and general queer community is like at Princeton. It seems to have a reputation for being more conservative than most ivies, and I know it recently invited Abigail Shrier to do a talk and has its fair share of transphobic professors. A couple in each university seem relatively unavoidable, but basically I'm worried that the student body and atmosphere as a whole is overwhelmingly straight, cause I wouldn't find that a lot of fun. Queer people at Princeton, do you feel like this is true, or have I completely misunderstood the student atmosphere (I hope so)?",

Besides, at any school including Princeton you\u2019ll get enough free shit as a freshman to fill a dormitory dresser, you\u2019ll be donating/throwing that stuff out in droves by the end. \n\nA piece of advice: try to compartmentalize these very separate thoughts \u2014 especially as they broaden into what seems like some pretty angry political viewpoints. Even if the school _should_ send you a tee shirt as an admitted student or book more convenient flights, what does that have to do with the funding for LGBT+ student groups? More broadly, how is it any way applicable to the conversation here? Don\u2019t use your individual issue as a motivation to cast anger and hate at unrelated groups.",

Now I have to go to this uni that was never my #1 for shitty aid. The most \"generous\" aid offer requires me to independently acquire thousands of $$$. My literal state school with no merit aid is cheaper for my income of &lt;$18,000. I know my worth and it sucks. \n\nFor anyone deciding, think of the message they sent when they deliberately don't send merch. UChicago sends a scarf, Columbia sends a shirt, Brown sends a hat, and I was sent nada. The message is 'fuck you'. Even the flight is bizarre and stupid. My ticket was made without my input and I will be returning at like 3 a.m. because 'God forbid we don't cut corners. We need to inconvenience everyone to save a dime yet also spend $$$ on unneeded shit'. If this school becomes normal (like Yale) and does not do weird/hurtful things I would like it more. \n\nLiterally Case Western was more hospitable and booked me 2 days in a hotel instead of 1 -- Case Fucking Western is more generous. God save the Queen.",

Secondly, applied work in econ is BASED on theory. There is no academic department that is purely theory or applied, and I would go as far as to say all the top econ departments have a similar balance of theory and applied as to Princeton. I can say this for certain.  In addition, princeton has great empirical tradition in labour economics, industrial relations, etc. I'd like some of the joint the person that wrote this above wrote, because it seems pretty pretty potent. \n\nFyi, \"applied\" economics focusing solely on applied work with no theoretical basis, is usually held to low regard (a good chunk of of economists aren't exactly fans of cute-nomics trend or whatever it is either)",

We thought he must be having a rough time or something, so we reached out to gently ask him if everything is going okay and I know transitions are hard but we're here to help if you want, and the guy just gets SUPER mad about how \"the help haven't come to pick up my laundry even once yet\". Didn't even consider that he could do it himself, and he was not particularly amenable when we offered to teach him how to do it.",

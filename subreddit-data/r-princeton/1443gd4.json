    "postText": "I recently received my housing assignment (New Graduate College) and will be starting a bit early on July 3rd. As I prepare to move in on July 1st, I've come across some concerning stories about the new graduate college, including issues like the lack of air conditioning.\n\nI have a few specific questions in mind, and any insights or personal experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated:\n\n1. Meal Plan Experience: Can you provide feedback on the meal plans offered at the graduate college? Would you recommend opting for the unlimited plan or the 105 meals plan? Any suggestions or advice regarding the meal options?\n2. Coping with No Air Conditioning: How did you manage the lack of air conditioning in the graduate college? Did you bring a portable air conditioner or find alternative solutions to keep cool during the summer months?\n3. Are mini-fridges allowed in a room? \n4. Is it correct to understand that all rooms are single but share a bathroom?\n\nAs a newcomer to the US, I'm open to any additional tips, advice, or insights you have regarding the overall living experience at NGC. Your input will be immensely helpful in ensuring a smooth transition!",

Buy a fan, take cold showers, hang out in buildings with AC until the sun goes down. I don't think portable ACs are allowed but some people get them anyway.\n3. Yes. Microwaves are not, technically, unless you get a Microfridge, though the fire inspections people can't move your stuff so a lot of people get one and throw a towel over it before inspections.\n4. Yes, you'll share a bathroom with ~5-10 people, depending on how your hall's laid out.",

Can hide them in your backpack for extra security too. Some of the grad students are eating 2-3 meals a day out of a single dining hall visit lol.\n\nNGC is rough, but you will meet a lot of new people especially with the dining hall. Second-year and up housing (especially Lakeside) is really nice though.",

            "comment": "Current graduate student, lived in the New GC during my first year.\n\n1. I struggled to use up even the 105 meal plan when I was on it. There's a lot of free food on campus and by the end of the term, felt that I was eating at the dining hall just to use up the swipes. The food is passable. Scope out the undergrad dining halls and see which ones you like - they usually have better options and the swipes work there just fine. I liked Rockey/Mathey's.\n2. The lack of air conditioning is pretty killer. New Jersey gets pretty muggy and it can be rough without the air conditioning. Most undergraduates get box fans and use those to try to cool down. That's a good option. I think it's part of a plot to keep you in the lab/office, honestly, because my lab was air conditioned and as a result, there were nights that I actually chose to go into work rather than stay in my room in the GC as it was much more physically comfortable.\n3. Mini fridges are allowed. A previous commenter suggested a micro-fridge, but be aware that microwaves are not permitted in GC rooms. Many students have them anyway (the common tactic is to throw a towel over them when room inspections happen, as the inspectors are not allowed to touch any of your belongings and therefore can't verify that the microwave-shaped lump is a microwave.)\n4. In the New GC, all rooms are singles. Bathrooms are communal within a single hallway. Honestly, they were pretty gross when I lived there. The hairballs in the showers were nearly sentient. It's also pretty easy to forget your keycard in your room when going to the bathroom/showering, which will lock you out of your room. Oops!\n\nOverall, my experience in the GC was poor and I have since recommended staying way from it to all of the prospective students that I talk to. However, there are many students I know who really liked the communal living for the social opportunities that it provided as well as easy access to the D-Bar (the graduate student bar located in the basement of the grad college). If you're looking for a social scene, the GC is probably the best way to find that in your first year, especially if you're in a smaller or less social department.",

You will not eat all meals a day.\n\nRe: no AC, I think it's pretty manageable. I've lived in dorms in places that hit &gt;100 F or &gt;40 C. It's usually only annoyingly bad in the summer months near the start of term. Just get a box fan and keep yourself hydrated.\n\n(**Have you heard about the forest fires in Canada whose particulates are now traveling down the east coast?** The skies are thick and orange. Fortunately, I've experienced something similar when the exact same thing happened to Portland in 2020, and it was  survivable, but the dust certainly got everywhere. These fires may be an even bigger problem for your summer.)\n\nRe: mini-fridges, a cursory search here suggests they are allowed:\n\n[https://hres.princeton.edu/policies/residential-living/dormitory-annex-regulations](https://hres.princeton.edu/policies/residential-living/dormitory-annex-regulations)\n\nHowever, I would recommend getting a \\*\\*Microfridge\\*\\*. It is offered at most US college dorms, including Princeton. It's rented from the school and it is a microwave and fridge all-in-one. Google it. Because it's rented, USUALLY the school takes care of installing it and removing it (depends! IDK for Princeton yet!). Anyways, that way you don't need to worry about it when moving out.\n\nI see some horror comments of Princeton dorms, but I've seen OGC/NGC, and I've lived in dorms of 3 other institutions, and nothing gets worse than Columbia's... I've seen some horrors from Yale too. At least Princeton keeps building new infrastructure, unlike the pre-WWII dorm blocks at the other Ivies.\n\nNot to mention, it is very unique of Princeton to offer dorms at all, let alone guaranteed housing for 3 years. Princeton's options are much cheaper and kinder than anything Columbia offers for grad students (which is nothing) in NYC Manhattan. UC Irvine comes close, but their campus is much larger in area, but their grad students are only given a lottery with about 1-in-4 chance of housing.",

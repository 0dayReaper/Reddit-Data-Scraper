Most of your classmates will be doing the same thing, and it\u2019ll save you time.",

Not everyone comes in with credits though!",

Took and did well in a multivariable calc class at local college senior year of high school. 4 credits. Took BC and AB in 11th and 10th grades, respectively. Not sure Pton will accept the credits for multivariable but if they will, better to take again as first year at Pton or use the credits if they will allow?",

It's been a while since I've taken calc, and I'm planning on concentrating in physics, so I don't want to fully place out of Calc I and II. I'd love it if I could place into an accelerated Calc II class as a review instead of taking two full semesters of Calc I and II again (if Princeton offers that sort of thing).\n\nI know I'll probably be able to talk with an advisor about this, but it would be super helpful to know what options are available with these scores for my own personal planning. Thanks all!",

Unless you really want to retake the intro classes, there is not really a benefit I don\u2019t think. There\u2019ll be a lot of people that have the same background as you so it would be a personal choice.

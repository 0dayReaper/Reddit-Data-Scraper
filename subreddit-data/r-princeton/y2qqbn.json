    "postText": "Hello fellow Princeton students!\n\nWanted to let y'all know of a christian group on campus called \"Klesis Christian Fellowship\" and advise you to stay away from them if you're looking for a Christian group at Princeton.\n\nA friend of mine from the class of 2022 made a video about her experience with the group, which I recommend you checking out if you're apart of the group or thinking about joining. She shares how she came to the realization of leaving, and hopefully it can bring clarity to those who feel stuck with the group! \n\nLink to video: [https://youtu.be/aXa4AJxY4kA](https://youtu.be/aXa4AJxY4kA)",

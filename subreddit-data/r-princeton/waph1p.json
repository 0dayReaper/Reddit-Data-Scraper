Not the same z-group, but in theory sophomores still have RCAs and a z-group, although in practice they rarely do anything except at best offer you free food occasionally. I never met or heard from my sophomore RCA.\n\n3. Not uncommon. I\u2019m only close with one member of mine, but I am casual friends with 2 others, and I still greet the rest when I run into them. Of course, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll get to know your roommate(s) pretty well, so if you don\u2019t dislike each other you\u2019ll likely keep in touch",

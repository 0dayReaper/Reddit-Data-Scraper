Best way to do it is to get a group of like 5-6 friends together, each order something different, and share with small plates. The owners cook for charity constantly so food almost always comes really quickly, and they\u2019re lovely people. I do at least one Hunan pilgrimage every Reunions.",

They are constantly understaffed and their employees are overwhelmed and it showed.  Basic requests like 'can I have my hoagie cut in thirds?' are ignored by both staff and management.  We don't go buy from there anymore, including for alumni events.",

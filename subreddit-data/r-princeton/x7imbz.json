    "postText": "I just finished my freshman year, and it was rough. While I don't know my GPA, my final grades were low eighties and low nineties (highest 95/lowest 80). At some point my grades got as low as most 60s. Even if I do rebound and get good grades for the next 2-3 years, do I have a chance of getting into a decent college? What would I have to do to get in? Forgot to state that I have been diagnosed with ADD.",

            "comment": "You can definitely get into a good college. There are TONS of good colleges and one tough year (especially freshman year) isn\u2019t going to ruin those odds. What you can do now is\u2026 A) get good grades (asking questions, looking for a tutor, staying after school etc as needed, finding strategies to help with ADD), B) get involved in extra curriculars you are excited about and can make an impact on, C) think about what you want to get out of college and learn about them! \n\nSome colleges, including Princeton and other ivies, are super competitive and there\u2019s no one who can comfortably expect to get in based on their GPA or SATs etc. One tough year won\u2019t disqualify you if you can explain, but I would make sure you aren\u2019t defining the only \u201cgood\u201d colleges as Ivy or Princeton tiered schools. Lots of great schools and most important part is it find one that is a good fit for you!",

If you know early on what you want to study you can find much easier to get into universities that still perform very well in your field.",

            "comment": "I had a great time with group therapy after my gap year, professional people who really cared about your wellbeing. With my personal psychiatrist however, it's pretty bad. The appointments themselves are fine, but it's happened like 2 or 3 times already where I need an appointment and it gets pushed up and pushed up for weeks at a time. And it's not even my psychiatrist sending them, just an automated email that makes you call the number to reschedule. I also currently don't have my antipsychotic medication because my psych hasn't ordered a refill days after I directed CVS to let her know. When I brought all this up to the person I was on the phone with, they basically just told me to email my psych about my concerns. Generally just inept at their jobs. If you're thinking of using their services, I'd try it out for a semester just to see how your experience is before seeking out a private psychiatrist through your insurance.",

            "comment": "I really appreciate all the work that CPS does, but I think providing more services is one of the biggest things princeton needs to work on in that area. My therapist is great and she cares a lot, but there is just not enough availability in CPS\u2014 it can be difficult to get an appointment and to schedule recurring meetings. This hasn\u2019t been a huge problem for me and I\u2019ve been able to meet with her ~ every 3 weeks, but I know this schedule wouldn\u2019t work for most. However, it\u2019s a good program overall, and they have emergency resources as well.",

            "comment": "I personally had a great relationship with my CPS therapist\u2014I saw her during my senior year, and kind of wish I could still see her as my therapist. I know lot of people have had bad experiences with CPS, but mine has personally been great\u2014after I waited the couple of weeks to get an initial appointment.  \n\n\nAlso just remember that psychiatrists are different from therapists\u2014usually psychiatrists only ask about your emotions insofar as they can figure out what to prescribe you, while therapists are there to actually help you work through things. Not that psychiatrists aren't helpful\u2014my SSRIs that I've been prescribed have seriously changed my life, definitely worth a thought.",

            "comment": "Went once on encouragement from friends when I was feeling particularly burnt-out / motivation-lacking / malaise-y. This was probably 2011 or 2012.\n\nBasically summarized the bullet points of my background for the counselor (some context: first-gen college, poverty-line in a rural state, bad parental divorce, alcoholism/drug issues in the family, emotional abuse, some physical violence, talking Mom down from suicide / dealing with her clinical depression / parenting-the-parent, working part-time through high school from the time I was legally able to, general trauma of growing up \"different\" which was eventually, finally diagnosed as neurodivergence, you get the picture.)\n\nCounselor's response, as best I can quote after ~ten years of memory fuzzing: \"...Holy shit, I don't even know where to start. I don't understand how you're this normal?\"\n\n...It was not helpful, and I did not go back! Plus I ended up having to explain to the dean that, no, I didn't feel that I would be better served by taking a gap year, which was a wonderful cherry on top of the experience.\n\nIt does seem like things have gotten a bit better in recent years, going off of what I've heard from younger alums / students at recent Reunions.",

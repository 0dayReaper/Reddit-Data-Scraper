    "postText": "Hi all, I was recently accepted into a PhD program in the geosciences department, and am weighing my options. I have a big dog that needs to run and play with other dogs daily, as we currently live very close to a large, forested dog park where we start most of our days.\n\nDoes/has anyone owned a dog while living in Princeton housing? Are there off leash areas/parks for dogs-- that offer more than some wood chips-- within a reasonable distance from the campus? I have a car, and am happy to drive &lt;15 mins one-way daily.\n\nFor reference, I'm weighing Princeton against MIT, so...two vastly different living situations. If anyone has any broader comments on this, those are appreciated as well.\n\nThanks for reading!",

There is housing on both sides of town so check where you\u2019ll be and map to dog parks from there. https://www.bringfido.com/attraction/parks/city/princeton_nj_us/",

There is a separate small dog side as well.  MP as a whole has lots of trails and room for running around generally if that is your thing.",

I lived by Community Park South, and was able to walk her around there, and around Community Park North and Witherspoon woods. The institute woods are also good places to walk/run your dog long distances. While it's not a dog park, if you're sufficiently social, and your dog is well trained, you can find people to have your dogs meet up and play off leash in those parks.",

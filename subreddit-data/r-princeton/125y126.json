    "postText": "I'm a junior majoring in Computer Science at Rutgers University-Newark and am interested in applying for the CS MS program this fall. I want to ask:\n\nIs it better to have multiple research projects in my application or just one that I am passionate about?\n\nHow important is it to have technical internship experience? Is it more important than research experience?\n\nWhat should I expect to be asked in the interview?\n\nWhere can I find labs that specialize in CS and are open to working with new students?",

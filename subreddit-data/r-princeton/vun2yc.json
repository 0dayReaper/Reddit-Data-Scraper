    "postText": "Hi! I just visited Princeton's beautiful campus and I loved it! However, I learned that there is no Medical school and that there is not a hospital chain nearby other than the Penn-Princeton medical building that is about a 10 minute drive from campus.\n\nSo, are there any Princeton pre-meds out there that can talk a little bit about their experiences as a pre-med here and how they feel that the opportunities for pre-meds at Princeton compare to other Ivys/schools? Thanks!",

            "comment": "Not a pre-med, but as a bio major I have taken the same classes and know a ton of them. From what I\u2019ve seen, people don\u2019t do much shadowing/volunteering during the semester (mostly over breaks and during summer), other than the few that serve as volunteer EMTs with the Princeton First Aid and Rescue Squad. Anyway, keep in mind that at most top schools you\u2019re going to be pretty busy during the semester anyway, so even if there\u2019s a major hospital on your campus it can be hard to make time to shadow/volunteer when you have classes. Princeton pre-med courses are pretty tough, but again, that\u2019s probably true at any top school - go to your state school if you want a perfect GPA. One great thing about Princeton is the number of research opportunities and internships - the thesis requirement means if you\u2019re a MOL or EEB major you\u2019ll be doing real biological research (and if you want to, you can orient this toward human disease/health), and the global health certificate program has lots of opportunities too. Also keep in mind that a very high number of Princeton pre-meds take a glide year between college and med school; again, this will be true at lots of top colleges, but keep that in mind. Visit hpa.Princeton.edu to read some statistics and recommendations from them.",

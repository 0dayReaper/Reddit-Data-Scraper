However, they might take the credit for placement if you have the syllabi and badger the departments enough which I did for math (this was a few years ago so I don\u2019t know if their policies on that have changed since then).",

If you apply to grad school, they could ask to see transcripts from all college courses taken, perhaps including dual enrollment (check their policies). For job applications that ask for GPA you can calculate it pretty much any logical way that isn\u2019t lying.",

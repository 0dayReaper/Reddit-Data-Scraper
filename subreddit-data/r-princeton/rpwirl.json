    "postText": "Hey guys!\n\nI'm a HS senior who was recently admitted to Princeton. I've been reading a lot about all the opportunities for undergraduates, and I'm really excited to take advantage of them all. I'd like to make the most of my Princeton experience.\n\nToday, I got the pamphlet for the \"What makes us human?\" humanities sequences, and it looks like a phenomenal set of programs. However, I have a wide range of interests (I'm planning to concentrate in Physics with certificates in Music Performance and possibly French), and I'm not sure if I would be able to fit all the courses I need to into my first two years if I took this course. I'm planning on applying for internships/study abroad opportunities in French and Physics for all three summers of my undergrad, so developing proficiency in spoken French and a deeper knowledge of physics/mathematics are high on my priority list for my first couple of years at Princeton. I'm just a bit wary that I won't be able to accomplish that with this course, causing me to potentially miss out on an opportunity for a summer program.\n\nHas anyone here taken the course/been in a similar situation? If so, what do you recommend?\n\nThanks so much!",

            "comment": "TL; DR: Yes, but think carefully about whether you really want to.\n\nFirst off, can you? Absolutely. You can also sign up for it after your freshman year\u2014even your senior year\u2014if you want more time to adjust. Let's say you want to take 10 semesters of physics, 6 of math, 6 of French, and 5 of music. That's most of your courses, so adding HUM would leave you very light on other free electives, but it's still very doable.\n\nDo make sure that it's what you want. My experience with HUM is that they ask you to read a lot (as advertised) but don't really give you much time to discuss books with others. With the Odyssey, for example, we had a single 50-minute lecture and about half of an 80-minute precept, so 90 minutes total (of which 40 was discussion) for one of the best-known works of western literature. To call that skimpy would be an understatement.\n\nI was also disenchanted by the essays because to me, the point of such a course is to broaden your thinking about all the different things you read, finding connections you might not notice if you just focused on one book. Instead, you're actively encouraged to ignore 99% of what you read and just focus on a short passage. In other words, the exact opposite.\n\nI had a much better experience with humanities at Princeton after I started taking random classes in various departments. I really enjoyed my classes on Tolstoy, the Crusades, and many more\u2014but for those, I got to choose what I wanted and go for it. Think about it. Talk about it.\n\nHUM was convenient for me in some respects. It satisfied the prereqs for two of my minors, and I met some great people. Some of my classmates discovered passions for things they hadn't read before. HUM did make me more well-read, but I've always been conflicted over whether it was worth it.",

One of the most attractive aspects of the course was the emphasis on great literature and expanding how we interpreted works of art throughout the history of western civilization, so if the discussions/coursework aren't really supportive of that mindset, I think I'd personally be better off investing my time in more interesting classes.\n\nThanks so much for your insight! I'll consider it a bit further, but I won't make any quick decisions until I've sat down with an advisor and looked at all my options for my schedule.",

Has some good extracurriculars, ap scores, and awards.  Surprised to get flat rejection versus a deferral.\n\nDoes the admissions office ever provide the review file to  rejected candidates so as to help with other applications?\n\nIt was nice floating in this universe while it lasted. \n\nCongrats to those accepted.",

Loads of students who get rejected would have done great as students - totally \u201cqualified.\u201d It\u2019s more random than most want to believe. Students who get rejected one year might have gotten in another year. Students who get into their reaches often get rejected from targets and even sometimes safeties. It can all feel quite random and confusing from outside the black box. If your student had the stats to make a legit run at Princeton I\u2019m sure they will be just fine wherever they wind up.",

But I wonder if there's something that originates within your student, out of pure determination and passion and in a direction no one has pointed before.",

    "postText": "First off, right off the bat, I must say I am not selling anything and I certainly don't want any contact info. I just wanted to share (see below google drive link of\u00a0*free*\u00a0resume/cover letter and interview tactics files) what I learned from one year of job searching and going through the daily, arduous ordeal that is crafting resumes and networking online.\n\nThis is the exact process for how I landed a role, finally, with a job I like.\n\nJust in time for graduation and/or summer break :)\n\nWhether looking for an internship, your first career job, or\u00a0*actually*\u00a0good tips for interview tactics, this guide and embedded files are something I wish I had when I was in university and on the job hunt.\n\nBecause let's be honest, in all our schooling, NO ONE EVER TAUGHT US HOW TO DO THIS AND IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT! Am I right?? Yeeesh.\n\nAnyways, below is the resource-filled link and practical advise that is an accumulation of all my personal research and assistance from job coaches ($1500 total spent there, yikes!), and the resumes I edited for my colleagues (once I figured out the formula), complete with notes on how you can do it, too.\n\n(They all got jobs as a result, btw. One friend, I kid you not, had zero interviews in 6 months then had 3 in one week after following this ressume formula and other methods. Could have been a fluke, but I'm just saying this method works. No promises of course, but its genuine).\n\nIt details how I got recruiters' attention, networked online with people who had the role I dreamed of, and, most importantly, includes a\u00a0*jaw-dropping*\u00a0resume/cover letter format, as well as interview tactics, cold outreach email templates, and modules that someone sent me that contain practical tips and tricks for how to get that coveted role:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FPNgs-XdO58uyDnZmHf4y4AIlHqKA-4w?usp=share\\_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FPNgs-XdO58uyDnZmHf4y4AIlHqKA-4w?usp=share_link)\n\nIt's my goal to help ease the anxiety and stress of this process for all those students who may be actively or passively looking for a job and need help standing out from the pack.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, trust this oft-rejected fool that this resume format is\u00a0*perfect*. I know this because I tried many, many other formats and this one was the one that landed me and my colleagues roles\u00a0*much*\u00a0quicker and added a \"WOW\" factor to it.\n\n**Some additional notes on resumes:**\n\n1. Usually keep it to one page.\n2. Keep the format and font the same as these examples; just put in your information. I included other CVs to showcase a variety of roles/careers. I think there is some formatting errors on a couple resumes, but you can fix those. I saved them as Word files so they are editable. :)\n3. Believe me when I say numbers mean everything in a resume, no matter the industry. So put them on as many bullet points as you can. Hiring managers\u00a0*love*\u00a0that. Which is better? \"responsible for managing team and hosting meetings\" or \"managed team of 20 coworkers, whose combined sales reached 112% quota\" See what I'm sayin?\n4. Keep this bullet point format: Past tense verb (created, developed, etc) ---&gt; number ---- result number. Every bullet point, or as many as possible. Search resume verbs in google for ideas, or use the ones in the resumes provided.\n5. Did I mention have a lot of numbers on it? Just want to hammer that home. As many bullet points as you can. Numbers = profit or quantifiable results, separating you from the \"vague description\" applicants. It all falls apart if you don't do this, in my experience, and the resume will never get looked at, I can darn near 100% promise that.\n6. Inverted pyramid style: Chronological order, most recent job = 7 bullet points, next most recent = 5-6, etc etc all the way down. Some can be equal, it just has to be decending order. This looks good visually and they mostly care about what you did most recently anyways.\n7. Write a\u00a0*bad ass*\u00a0description of the company you worked for, right under your job title. This shows the recruiter how awesome that company is and it helps them understand what their mission is or even just\u00a0*what*\u00a0that company does, if it isn't obvious.This is\u00a0*KEY!*Ex: \"Johnny's Burger Joint was rated as the top burger restaurant in Boston by Boston Magazine. They serve an avg. of 1000+ customers a day and my franchise was rated the top out of 200+ locations across America.\" See how much better that is than just the name? You feel the difference?\n8. Numbers below ten, spell out. All others just write the number. Instead of exact numbers, when they get too big, write a \"+ after the rounded number (ex: \"157 employees ---&gt; \"150+ employees\") and with numbers 1,000 and up abbreviate with capital \"K\" for thousand, \"M\" for million (ex: $23,800 ----&gt; $23K+; $5 million ---&gt; $5M)\n9. Exectuive summary also has numbers and must be\u00a0*bad ass*. No more than two sentences. See examples.\n10. I changed all the names in the resumes to protect the innocent :)\n\n**Notes on how to find jobs/ grow network:**\n\nPlease, please,\u00a0*pleeeeeease*\u00a0don't waste your time applying to LinkedIn or Indeed posted jobs. 99% chance it's a waste of time. I sent out 500+ resumes like that over the course of a year and got one interview from it.\n\nTotal fail.\n\nNow that I work for a large company, I see just how true that is. We did a hiring spree at the beginning of this quarter and every single one of the new hires was a referral.\n\nEvery. Single. One.\n\nCompanies just post those because they ... have to? Not really sure, but again, this is my experience.\n\nI can't stress enough how important it is to get an\u00a0*in*\u00a0at a company.\n\nSo how do you do that if your network is small, just starting out, or you dont have any friends (like me! lol)?\n\nGet your LinkedIn up and going - this is super important because its the first thing hiring managers look at.\n\nIf you have exhausted all your friends and family to see if their company has a role you want, try this LinkedIn approach (the modules in the link also have other methods outside this one as well):\n\nWhat I did was paste my resume info in the description field on LI, added a nice photo and background, and added a ton of people from realtor groups (they always accept requests) to get me to the coveted 500+ connection badge and make me look suuuuuuuper cool. (LI has a limit to the number of adds a day, so will take a few days to accomplish this).\n\nI then sent DMs to people in a role or company that I wanted to work for. It went something like:\n\n\"Hey (name)- I'm a (junior, senior, grad student, etc) at (uni name) and I just wanted to say that your job at (company name) seems like the dream role I'm working towards! How do you like it?\" People are flattered you like their role, and it opens the dialogue up for more conversation, which is when you later ask to speak with them about the company in a call or over coffee (more details on that in the link).\n\nUse the free site [hunter.io](http://hunter.io/) to find anyone's work email to send cold emails to (email templates in the link).\n\n\\------------------------\n\nLook, I have a history of mental\u00a0health issues and the the job search used to make me super depressed back in the day. I totally get it.\n\nI don't want that for\u00a0*anyone*.\n\nYou all should be spending time studying and not re-doing your resume for zillionth time.\n\nThat's why I took the time to make this guide.\n\nI want the process to be as easy as possible for\u00a0*everyone*\u00a0and for\u00a0*free*.\n\nI'm sure your university has a Career Services department, but I can almost guarantee their resume and tips ain't as good this.\n\nAnyways, best of luck to you all in getting that scholarship, internship or first job that sets you ever so slightly faster on the path for career success!\n\nLet me know in the comments if this helped.\n\nGo get 'em, Champ!",

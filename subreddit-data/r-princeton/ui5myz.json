    "postText": "Hey all, I hope everyone is well. I came across a thesis written by David Duchovny titled \"The Schizophrenic Critique of Pure Reason in Beckett's Early Novels\" and would look to get my hands on it. I found it on Princeton's DataSpace, but I couldn't access it as I am not a student there. If anyone can get the pdf and somehow share it, it'd be great!\n\nTitle: The Schizophrenic Critique of Pure Reason in Beckett's Early Novels  \nAuthor: David Duchovny  \nlink: [https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp01qr46r235c](https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp01qr46r235c)\n\nThank you in advance.",

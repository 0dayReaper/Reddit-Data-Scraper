    "postText": "Hey everyone! For context I\u2019m an incoming sophomore at Princeton in ORFE - was considering COS but ultimately chose ORFE bc of the optimization/ML aspects. I was considering trying to get into quant after undergrad to make some money and for the experience early, then transition into something else with CS later (would be more flexible if money isn\u2019t the top top priority). However, I\u2019m not sure how feasible it is to go into quant straight from undergrad, especially since I\u2019m not super smart, relatively (never could do math competitions, got to pton by grinding). Unsure if I\u2019d still try quant if i needed grad school. Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)",

It's usually much easier to get a reply from an alumni since you two already have something in common (Princeton!). Use [TigerNet](https://secure.tigernet.princeton.edu/s/1760/02-tigernet/20/interior.aspx?sid=1760&amp;gid=2&amp;pgid=3&amp;cid=40&amp;returnurl=https%3a%2f%2ftigernet.princeton.edu%2fs%2f1760%2f02-tigernet%2f20%2finterior.aspx%3fgid%3d2%26pgid%3d254) to find the contact and career info of alumni. I've contacted several alumni and have gotten like a 85%+ response rate. Most are very happy to help younger students! You should do some research into networking yourself, but very broadly, I usually start off with a short email explaining why I'm interested in them and asking if they would be willing to do a short \\~20 minute call to ask some questions.",

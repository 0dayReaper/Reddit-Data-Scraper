    "postText": "Hi friends. I was thinking of posting this on r/ApplyingToCollege but I figured it'll be more apt to be posted here.\n\nI'm under the impression (please correct me if I'm wrong), that while school ranking isn't everything, there is just an unmatched level of support and resources at top tier universities like Princeton. Academics-wise and culture-wise, different top schools may provide different experiences, which will undeniably change someone in a different way.\n\nNow, in terms of fit which is something applicants have to discover themselves, would you say the resources/support that Princeton gives is immense to the point of 'life-changing'? \n\n* i.e. how much are you willing to sacrifice to get into Princeton now that you're here and see the actual impact/benefits that being to Princeton brings you?\n* Would you then say the support is so significant that it almost definitely outweighs a Top 15 Asia university? (I'm asking because there's a T15 uni in my country \u2014 I'm an intl')\n\nAnyways, I'm sure there are many factors at play but I'm really happy to hear any thoughts from the Princeton community!",

            "comment": "I think what\u2019s most important is to figure out what you value and what you are looking to get out of college. Princeton definitely changed my life, but more in terms of greatly expanding my perspective, pushing me far outside my comfort zone, making me understand others points of view and take a hard look at what I had been taught. \n\nIt also gave me access to great jobs that I wouldn\u2019t have gotten at other colleges \u2014 where being a strong policy student meant I could still be considered for a variety of jobs just because I had a good GPA and activities from a school like Princeton. \n\nThat being said, if you already know you want to have a career in X or Y, or if you define college success as making a lot of money afterwards, there may be not as much value compared to schools with great programs and connections in X or Y.  I also think the value and life changing-ness I experienced would have been similar at other top colleges. I think what was important for me is that Princeton also had the right environment for me \u2014 a good size, a college town location, living on campus, great financial aid, etc. \u2014 a sort of place where I could flourish and take advantage of those benefits, instead of being overwhelmed.",

This then would make someone who is good great, and someone who is great even greater.\n\nI could, however, be greatly misinformed so I dont' really want to make too many assumptions. Would you say what I shared is mostly correct or am I misinformed?\n\nAppreciate any reply!",

            "comment": "I think your statement can be right, because the T10 do have a ton of funding, name recognition, etc. but the T10 aren\u2019t necessarily the best for entrepreneurship. Your thinking also relies on you putting 100% in and excelling at a T10, which is honestly super tough. It\u2019s easy enough to do well there, but honestly can be harder to stand out and be top of class. It\u2019s also assuming a T10 is a good fit for you (not saying it isn\u2019t, but each has their own culture, identify, environment, strengths that may or may not fit what you need). \n\nI think there are also some really great T50 schools, which are super close to T10, so it isn\u2019t all or nothing like a crazy cliff.\n\nSo, TLDR \u2014 yes, T10s have additional benefits but most of how successful you will be is based on who you are, what\u2019s the right path for you, your own dedication, etc.",

                    "comment": "u made really great points! i am thinking more along the lines of being an avg student in T10 and not necessarily excelling academically- correct me if im wrong but im thinking students in Princeton in general get access to similar resources (not considering those really prestigious post-grad scholarships etc.)\n\nwhich means, as long as im not doing terrible in princeton, ill have the best minds around me, the great pool of resources, brand recogniton, etc.\n\nfor entrepreneurship- i suppose ure very right. but there seems to be a relationship btwn how highly ranked a sch is, and the amt of funding the avg founder receive. Obviously, this applies only in certain context and could purely be due to the fact that the brightest are gathered in such environment. For schools like Babson (most known fr entrep), im nt entirely sure ive seen as much outstanding startups as i do for Princeton- but i cld be misinformed.\n\nfor fit- i genuinely resonate with ur point. im js unsure if the 'fit' aspect would be so overwhelmingly helpful that it outweighs the resources and bright minds princeton has. Perhaps if we're considering - oh do you fit princeton or cornell better - that is perfectly reasonable. Argubaly applicable to UCB as well. but if we're talking about fitting santa clara vs Harvard, im not sure if ill pick the former.\n\nall in all really great insights from ur comments. thanks so much. please feel free to break my argument if u see any misconception, happy to learn more!",

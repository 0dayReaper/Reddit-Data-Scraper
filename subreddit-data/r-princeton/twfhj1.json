    "postText": "hi guys so i just got in to princeton yass and i was basically wondering how orientation works? this is mostly a question because my 18th birthday is in the middle of it and i just want to make sure i\u2019m gonna be able to call my little sister because she goes all out for birthdays and i\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019d be crushed if i couldn\u2019t at least say hi. idk i know my friends at yale said they take away their phones for a week which tbh makes sense i just want to be sure i can make this one phone call lol.\n\ncan u tell i like to plan far in advance. i\u2019m just worried about her for when i leave like ik she\u2019s gonna get over it but i don\u2019t want her to be sad :(",

I don\u2019t know what the policy on phones is these days but I didn\u2019t take anyones phone when I was a leader for trips. If you let the leaders know it\u2019s your bday they\u2019ll probably throw you a party in the woods and make sure you can talk to your family.\n\nLack of contact isn\u2019t due to any rules or anything. You\u2019re legit out in the woods.",

Indeed, OA typically takes away your phone for the trip, as well as any time-keeping device. This year was slightly different as COVID restrictions kept the program to day trips only. Orientation is absolutely packed and honestly there\u2019s not much time to relax\u2014your entire schedule is pretty planned out, but there\u2019s constant opportunity for social interaction with different groups of people (which is awesome).",

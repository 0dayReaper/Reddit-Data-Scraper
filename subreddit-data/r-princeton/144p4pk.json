    "postText": "I'm an incoming, partnered PhD student who was recently advised by Princeton Housing to start looking for off-campus housing due to the shortage of grad housing on campus. Anyone else on the same boat? Any tips or advice for new grad students looking to live off campus?\n\nAddendum: I have checked out Princeton Off-Campus Housing list, Zillow, [rent.com](https://rent.com) and [apartments.com](https://apartments.com). Those who haven't checked them out, please do! I'm looking mostly for hacks and hidden tips and tricks based on current students' lived experiences. ",

Best location?\n\nI will say that the best deals I've found have been on the off campus housing website (I've lived in four different apartments during my time here)\n The most affordable option is to rent a home with 4-5 bedrooms and split the rent among the tenants. Currently living in such a situation for $700/month. \n\nHowever, I am a lowly undergrad and thus am likely pinching pennies more than a grad student with a partner. I know that some grad students live in neighboring towns if they have a car, so that is a considerstion if you have a car",

I heard of apartments being transferred between multiple generations of X department\u2019 PhD students. \n\nOtherwise it\u2019s really tough. Check Zillow every day with great patience. Beware for scam particularly the cheap one bedroom in Palmer square. If you got a car, try plainsboro or Lawrenceville.",

Probably not the best option if you don\u2019t have a car because transit outside the campus area is basically non-existent.",

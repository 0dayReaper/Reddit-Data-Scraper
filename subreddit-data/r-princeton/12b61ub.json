    "postText": "Helloo, i am a current highschool senior who was just accepted to these schools. I am mainly debating between Harvard and Princeton as they gave me full aid (i have to pay around 10k for mit). I\u2019m also planning on going to grad school for physics. I would appreciate any input on princeton\u2019s academics, social life, and location. I\u2019m an international student so i am clueless on a lot of things, especially in terms of location (like the whole city life (Boston) vs college town (pton) situation). Thank you!",

One of my Junior Paper advisers later got a Nobel.  The semiconductor physics class prof in EE even got a Nobel later. You saw Wheeler, Wigner and Phil Anderson working in their offices in my time.  Nash was roaming the library. Not many other places have the history, the present and the future.  I feel that MIT is a bit too harsh of a place and I think the opportunities for independent research at Princeton is better for undergrads as compared to Harvard. (Obviously can't go wrong with any of the three but I'm old and biased haha.)",

Harvard is in Cambridge MA (right across river from Boston) and most folks live off campus in later years. Pros are you can cook for yourself, get a little more exposure to \u201cadult\u201d life. Cons are housing is expensive, less structured /campus life. Boston is also a lot colder for longer than NJ, which will get cold but for a much shorter time period. \n\nAnother big factor I would highlight is the undergraduate focus. Because Princeton doesn\u2019t have major business law or med programs, their focus really is the undergraduate experience \u2014 and it shows! Your access to professors, funding, and opportunities will be greater.\n\nI\u2019m biased \u2014 and say go Princeton all the way!! - but both are great choices.",

Also, we\u2019re only ~45min to an hour from NYC. Academics are tougher than Harvard (from what I\u2019ve heard) but rewarding if you put in the work.\n\nI\u2019d say the biggest benefits of Princeton are the liberal arts and undergrad focus. If you major in Physics here, you\u2019ll get tons of opportunities to explore other disciplines while also being exposed to research and plenty of grad school preparation.\n\nSocial life is good, mainly centred around Eating Clubs. (We also have a really fun International Orientation program that you can do in August, highly recommend)",

In terms of prestige and professor research acumen, you're choosing between absolute powerhouses in physics.\n\nAs a Princeton engineering physics certificate who knows quite a few physics majors and people who switched off physics, a quick word of caution (and not saying that Harvard/MIT is any better).\n\nPrinceton physics professors are absolutely brilliant in their fields, and that has absolutely no bearing on how well they teach. Additionally, there is some carryover from the old grade deflation days, so some professors treat the intro courses as weed out courses.\n\nAs a consequence, courses like 105, 106, 205 (\"Death Mech\") can be ridiculously brutal.\n\nJust remember that everybody you're in class with is brilliant and was likely top of their high school (even those getting a C), it's not a competition for grades, and don't forget to find friends and just enjoy college.\n\nCongrats again!",

So just keep in mind that you might not end up doing exactly what you think for your major... That said the response above is best about city vs town and both are a great choice.

So, if it were me, I'd lean to Harvard or MIT.  And, between those, I think Harvard is a better option because (1) free to you and (2) if you interests change and you decide to do something other than physics, Harvard will offer you a greater variate of majors to choose from.",

Leave exploring cities for when you're out in the world post-college, you'll have the rest of your life to do that. The small town undergrad experience is a very American thing that is awesome and worth experiencing.",

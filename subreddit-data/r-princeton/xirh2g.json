It's very easy to tell if the passion is genuine. \n\nPeople light up when they talk about real passions. They can't wait to share. They have countless stories.  \n\nSo many interviewees are like uhhhhhh I'm passionate about the environment or something, and if you ask even the simplest followup question they have nothing to say.",

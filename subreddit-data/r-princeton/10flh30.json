And even then, you can always choose to do something different post graduation.\n\nYour application profile is your best foot forward, I would hope that they think about \"overall fit\" before thinking about allocating/admitting x number of people for the history department. If they did, then admissions would look like graduate admissions where you apply to specific departments. They know that preferences change over time.\n\nedit: wait - they refer to freshmen as first years now? I just got tagged by the gender neutral bot... are they first year seminars now instead of Freshman seminars?",

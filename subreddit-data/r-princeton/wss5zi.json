As someone who started off with notebook and pencil, an iPad has made my academic life much more efficient and organized.\n\nStart problem sets early and work with friends and classmates on them. They will be challenging and take a few hours each depending on the class.\n\nDon\u2019t\u2019s:\n\nTake \u201chonors\u201d level math courses unless you have to, are a masochist, or just really enjoy math. They are usually much more proof based (and harder) than the normal math equivalents and a lot of BSE people end up regretting it.  Same thing with the honors level physics courses. \n\nSpend all your time studying. Remember to have fun with clubs and your friends doing young adult stuff",

Consider heavily if you want to actually be an engineer after college, and if there\u2019s even a slight chance you want to do something else like consulting, make sure to get at least 1 internship in that field.",

Do you think it would be worth it to take PHY105/106 if I did place out (results aren't out yet, but I thought I did *decently*) of physics? I don't plan on becoming a physicist or anything, but I do find physics interesting in general, and I think I have good preparation (5s on both AP Physics Cs). I'm also BSE btw.",

    "postText": "I know that universities take into account if a student is a good fit for the university, does being a good fit means to have a personality that fits into the community? How is community of Princeton is different than that of other universities like MIT, Northwestern, Stanford? What kind of personality does AO s praise in Princeton? I have done some research, and I think that Princeton students are different than those in other unis by their networking abilities, their interest in many fields, also despite studying stem related subjects, most of them have many extracurricular. And I think that Princeton praise music more than other colleges because I read that there is an Arch Sing, Charter Club Sing traditions in the university. Are these true or this is not which makes Princeton community unique. Btw, I am shortlisted for an interview next week and really would like to have a mock interview with current student. Thanks in advance\ud83d\ude04",

The interviews are usually very relaxed and don't have a big impact.  Just be authentic, recognize it's a roll of the dice, and accept whatever happens.",

I think OP\u2019s instinct is correct that Princeton students tend to be more cohesive and have more interests outside class than many other top rated schools. They also have the most active alums, as measured by participation in things like annual giving and reunions. The other side of the coin is that you are probably most likely to feel out of place at a school like Princeton if you are not part of that social scene in some way. \n\nNow, OP: your upcoming interview is valuable. We are told as interviewers to specifically focus on how a candidate might fit into the community. You can find multiple posts on this sub with advice about how to approach those interviews. I also want to note that there is no \u201cshortlist\u201d for those. Every applicant gets the opportunity for an interview.",

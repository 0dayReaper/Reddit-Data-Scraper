            "comment": "There\u2019s a bunch of interesting freshman seminars that are low workload, easy A, and kinda fun if you enjoy the subject and the professor is good. However, I\u2019d prob recommend reading reviews of other classes the prof teaches to make sure they\u2019re good.\n\nMost of the regular classes have precepts in addition to lectures. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not really anything unique to Princeton because a bunch of schools have similar systems. Precepts are hit or miss depending on the instructor/grad student that leads them. The format of the precept also differs depending on the type of class. Most STEM precepts will focus on practice problems while humanities precepts will typically focus on discussions and readings. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about precepts in general because it\u2019s not really something you can avoid.",

If you get accepted, it\u2019s something that every adult will tell you but you won\u2019t be able to respect until later - it\u2019s a life changing opportunity and puts you on a fast track towards many things that folks have to grip and claw their way towards. Career opportunities, name recognition and instant respect, and connections - all of that on top of a first class education. It\u2019s not necessarily fair that so many doors will open to you (and it would feel like they\u2019re opening for you alone, vs. friends and family), but you should take the opportunity if you can. \n\nI personally was choosing between Princeton and a smaller, lesser known school that I would\u2019ve \u201cenjoyed\u201d more, and it honestly would\u2019ve been a big mistake in retrospect.",

People complain about the university\u2019s academics or policies (some rightfully, some not), but I don\u2019t think they do so any more than at other colleges. It\u2019s objectively a great school with great professors, great students, and great opportunities, despite its flaws.\n\nThe social scene is honestly pretty diverse and what you make of it. If you want to party and go all-out every week, you can do that. But if you (like me) want more relaxed hangouts with close friends you can do that too. Or anything in-between. I\u2019d say apply, and see if you\u2019re accepted! Good luck!",

Mainly though , hope that COVID has significantly waned by the time you hit campus because it has a way of really nuking normal Princeton campus life",

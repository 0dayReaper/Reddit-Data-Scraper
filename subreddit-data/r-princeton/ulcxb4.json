    "postText": "I\u2019m moving out later this week and live in Blair. I\u2019m not sure where to have my parents park. I was thinking of the following options:\n\n1) they could just pull up in front of the building like during move-in. They would have to drive up Elm Drive but I heard that access to Blair drive is limited\n2) enter via Nassau but again I think that gate is always closed\n3) park in Lot 8 or on University Place\n\nI\u2019d prefer option 1 due to the weight of some items but would they need a permit or could they enter campus from somewhere else besides Elm?",

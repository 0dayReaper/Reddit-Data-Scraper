That restaurant is French and frankly a little inconsistent, but I like the outdoor seating options (it may be too cool to sit outside). Hulfish St ends at Witherspoon. If you walk about a block on Hulfish, there\u2019s Mediterra which also has outdoor dining and I believe bar seating. If you want a sweet treat, I love the Bent Spoon on Palmer Square for frozen desserts. I\u2019m partial to the vegan ice creams and the sorbets. Oh the banana whips are great as well.",

It\u2019s located a few doors down and across the street from Agricola. Personally, I don\u2019t like the food, but it has a loyal following maybe because it is one of the oldest restaurants in Princeton. There\u2019s the Ivy Inn on Nassau. It's a bar. Don't know if they serve food or if they would have the game on. I\u2019d recommend checking with them. Maybe Wimberie\u2019s on Palmer Square would have sports on. I definitely do NOT recommend eating there.",

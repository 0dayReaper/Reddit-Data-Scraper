She's not too bad, but from what I heard, she does an initally more macroeconomic approach before actually diving into microeconomic issues, in which she still tries to focus on the bigger picture of the topic. It's a different style of teaching microeconomics.\n\nNoonan teaches it traditionally. She's fine; I had her precept as well, and it a solid overall class. Go to office hours, and it's a manageable class. Study hard for the midterm and final, though, as they can be more difficult than expected.",

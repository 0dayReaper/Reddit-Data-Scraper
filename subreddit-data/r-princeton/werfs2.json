I was wondering if anybody here has balanced studying at Princeton while working at Starbucks(or any other outside part-time job) and I wanted to know if its feasible to continue working next year/how much free time I will still have.",

            "comment": "This will obviously depend on the number of hours you plan to work and the flexibility of the job (I\u2019ve never worked at Starbucks). I would say that balancing a job with school is a nontrivial undertaking, though it can certainly be done with a bit of care. For a concrete reference, I worked two jobs last year for a total of 10-15 hrs a week. It was probably as much as I\u2019d be comfortable doing (some days were pretty tight), and most people with jobs only do 5-10 hrs. Maybe it would be smart to ask the manager if you\u2019d be able to take the first week off to aclimate to school life and then ease into the hrs so you don\u2019t overwhelm yourself immediately.",

            "comment": "Honestly it'll depend on what classes you take and what other activities you want to do on campus. If you're BSE, chances are that your physics, chem, and math classes will take a lot of time, but you will still have time to do stuff you want (just less time compared to if you took more humanities based courses). You'll probably find some clubs you want to join and freshman year is a great time to explore those interests, so I wouldn't let a job take priority over academic development unless finances are an issue.\n\nIf you want to do some sort of job, you can certainly do an on campus job as others have said. You can also tutor which can pay 2-3x more than on campus jobs. A lot of my friends and I do it, so I can send you some companies if you're interested. Personally, I usually do 4-6 hours of tutoring each week.\n\nEither way, you should still have time to do fun stuff like go to parties and hang out with friends as long as you manage your time well.",

Now I mainly work on-campus jobs, and since those are designed for students, I think they're way more flexible (and depending on the job, they can pay pretty well). The acai bowl restaurant was fine but not as flexible as the on-campus jobs, and the on-campus jobs actually paid me way more. I really think it just matters who your boss at Starbucks is, though\u2014my boss was pretty nice but sometimes I would have to come in last minute since I lived so close to the restaurant, and the experience would've been way better had I not been asked to do that.",

            "comment": "I was in your same position freshman fall, and I ultimately decided not to go through with the transfer. Two reasons. The first is that I couldn't deal with the weekly unpredictability of food service hours. I had an issue getting my store manager to give me hours I could do as a high school student back at the Sbux in my home state. The second issue is pride. I come from a low-income background, so serving my campus compatriots who didn't need to work/the wealthy individuals who live in town proper rubbed me the wrong way. I worked a specialized (not reception) library job instead. Pre-COVID, so I had my own desk in the science library where I was paid more than anyone else I knew to do some clerical-type work. Very flexible and relaxed. **Do not take on any more stress than necessary at Princeton.**",

I don't think it's mandatory. For Nsci, maybe emphasize why that particular program appeals if you haven't said that in your essay already?? I don't think you'll be penalized at all if you leave it blank. Is there a prompt or is it just \"additional info?\" If the former, they're probs asking for something specific. If the latter, they're just asking if you have anything you have to add. NBD if not. Don't stress and good luck!",

It basically just says what you said, which is that it's a place where I can upload any other document that has information that I feel is necessary to share about myself. I ended up putting in my final paper for my Endocrinology course. I don't think it matters much at this point, though, because I submitted my application tonight and then realized that I somehow submitted my online portal screenshot of my transcript instead of my scan of the printed unofficial transcript, so Princeton is probably just not gonna happen for me.",

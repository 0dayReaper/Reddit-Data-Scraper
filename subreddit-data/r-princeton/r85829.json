Plus the crime rate is increasing rapidly and most TA\u2019s have been on strike so a couple of my classes were unofficial cancelled but I\u2019m probably not going to be reimbursed. Plus Princeton was my first choice.  I applied there last year got denied but accepted to Columbia so I went with it.",

    "postText": "Princeton Admissions' data recommends 1 year of a visual or performing art in high school.  Do they actually uphold this? Definitely prefer to take an engineering or CS course in my elective slot instead of taking an ART.  Can anyone speak to whether not taking an Art in high school will hurt me when I apply? \n\nThanks for sharing your insights.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s hard to say. Princeton admissions values two things: passion and being well-rounded. So, if that CS course goes along with amazing research you\u2019re doing outside school in that field or awards you\u2019ve won in that area or other things that show your passion, dig in. But if you\u2019re going for the classic Renaissance (hu)man approach to your application, take that art class and do something meaningful that you can submit with your app. \n\nI recently interviewed an applicant who is very dedicated to biology and being a doctor. But she also had an interest in art and used her AP art class to create a series of paintings on what mental illness looked like from different perspectives. I gave her an exceptional rating and strong recommendation for admission.",

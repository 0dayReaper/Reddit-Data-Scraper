Also have an intelligent question or two about the school (that isn\u2019t something you can easily learn from the website) prepared if the interviewer asks you if you have any. Don\u2019t get too stressed - it\u2019s just a conversation about you, your plans, and Princeton, so it doesn\u2019t require more than a half hour or so of preparation.",

I mostly just look for someone who seems like they are genuinely interested/curious/enthusiastic about something - literally anything (academic subject, a book, a video game, a sport, whatever) - and can talk about it intelligently. Best of luck to you!",

Being passionate about something can take many forms, so don\u2019t feel that you need to put on some high energy, bubbly personality to show that you\u2019re \u201cpassionate about something.\u201d You need to show that you care about something outside of when you\u2019re forced to by school or your parents.",

My interviewer and I bonded over our shared love of our grandparents, and I had just been in a car accident the day before mine so I talked to her about that and how it shook me up. Obviously most of the interview was about Princeton, but the point is that you shouldn\u2019t hide who you are. I still talk to my interviewer occasionally!!",

Come prepared with some questions that you want to ask about Princeton, and to talk about yourself. I did these interviews, and while we wrote reports there is no like checklist of questions to ask, or things that we were told to look for, so there is not really a model for how to do well. It will depend on your interviewer.",

I\u2019ve long been told (as an applicant then student then alum) they exist more for alumni engagement than anything else - and to make the process more personal for applicants. Don\u2019t stress and just go into it chill and curious to have a conversation. The stakes are very low",

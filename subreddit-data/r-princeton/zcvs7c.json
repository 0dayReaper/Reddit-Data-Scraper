It is considered a political science/liberal arts school, so I am wondering if I have lower chances because I am not those fields. I am mostly focused on technological engineering and have dance on the side.",

In fact, I don't even think Politics is our most popular major.   \n\n\nTo your question, I can't honestly answer that. Only the admissions office could really answer that, I suppose. However, I would recommend that you include as many relevant extracurriculars as possible to display your willingness to explore. If you are applying with Politics as one of your selected majors, feel free to talk about political science extracurricular in your essays. Good luck!",

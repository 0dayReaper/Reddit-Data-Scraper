    "postText": "Here is an honest recollection of some of the most memorable moments on campus I had:\n\n  \n1\u2013 The eating clubs were never mentioned. One student asked a question about it, and the dean said they were private and historic. And she was right. Historic is the sense of racism and sexism and private in that one is not even allowed to visit inside even though it is on the campus map and website. I walked down Prospect Street tonight (April 12th), and I was shocked to see it was 90% white and like 10% asian. I never saw a single black person be allowed in and, somehow, I was not surprised. Elitist clubs are elitist.   \n2\u2013 Campus is comically large and everyone has a bike.  \n3 \u2013 Funding is idiotic. A student panelist said they were able to somehow get the university to pay for a dental emergency, yet they said they would not pay for my books. This is why I\u2019m pissed.   \n4\u2013 The campus is very solemn. Not a lot of parties or activities going on, and the vibe is very much so \u2018workaholic\u2019.   \n5\u2013 Food was honestly pretty decent. The Frist Campus Center had semi-professional chefs making food at like three different restaurants (pizza, salad/kebab, and BBQ). I don\u2019t know what is stopping one from just leaving without paying though, as that was kinda the vibe.   \n6\u2013 There are a lot of weird stains and cracks on the building and walking paths.  \n7\u2013 I snuck inside a res college and it was decent. Standard stuff like a ping pong table and foosball game. The food is buffet style and looked okay. They did not really care about anything. Like I walked into the admin office for this college and nobody cared that I snuck in and was clearly not a matriculated student.   \n8\u2013 Way too white and asian. These two groups made up like 85% of all people here, and the smattering of every other ethnicity composed maybe a  measly 15% maximum. Also, on god, there were SO MANY small asian women and basic bitch white girls-- an absurd amount.   \n9\u2013 I like Whig Hall. Clio Hall, on the other hand, is the same exact shit just copy-pasted right next to it.  \n10\u2013 Everyone kept repeating the same talking points of the school: It is hard and it is collaborative.  \n11\u2013 WTF is that abomination next to the Jewish Life center. Looked like 9/11 just happened 15 times in a row. I think it was the math and science building or whatnot.",

Yeah, it\u2019s big - you rarely have to walk over 20 minutes, but if that seems unpleasant to you, a bike is a good move.\n\n3. Have you heard of dental insurance? Yeah, funding is confusing everywhere, but hopefully you understand these things aren\u2019t comparable.\n\n4. It\u2019s finals season right now - I thought the same thing when I went to preview. It\u2019s much better earlier in the semester.\n\n5. People get 7 dining dollars per meal for Frist area, and people are overall honest here.\n\n6. True\n\n7. Did you want them to call Psafe on you? Unsure what your complaint is\n8. Asians are 25% and whites are like 50%. Black people are around 13% (their prevalence in the overall US population), iirc. Hispanics are underrepresented.\n\n9. Cool\n\n10. Yeah\n\n11. Too much construction.",

    "postText": "I'm interested in the accuracy of the Senior Survey 2022 data, especially the \"GPA by Concentration\" data available at [https://projects.dailyprincetonian.com/senior-survey-2022/academics.html](https://projects.dailyprincetonian.com/senior-survey-2022/academics.html). Despite hearing negative stories from various sources, I have not found evidence of GPA deflation in some engineering majors, such as Chemical and Biological Engineering, which has a GPA of 3.73.\n\nAs an aspiring pre-med student at Princeton, I'm wondering how to interpret this data. Which major might offer better opportunities to achieve a higher GPA with the same amount of effort? My son is considering CBE as his major, and I'm curious whether this major would offer a better chance to achieve a higher GPA compared to Molecular Biology or Neuroscience, which have GPAs of 3.54 and 3.63, respectively. One hypothesis is that many pre-med courses are taught by professors from the Chemistry and Biology departments, which have GPAs of 3.66 and 3.54, respectively. Therefore, regardless of the major chosen at Princeton, pre-med courses might be more challenging and lead to GPA deflation.\n\nMoreover, what are your thoughts on Princeton's GPA policy for pre-med students? Are there any notorious weed-out courses or professors that students should be aware of? Any suggestions or comments would be appreciated. I've included a copy of the data at the bottom of the page for your reference.\n\n\\--- Proofread by ChatGPT !!!\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGPA by Concentration\n\nComparative Literature: 3.81  \nEast Asian Studies: 3.78  \nPhysics: 3.75  \nMathematics: 3.73  \nMusic: 3.73  \nChemical and Biological Engineering: 3.73  \nPhilosophy: 3.71  \nComputer Science: 3.70  \nOperations Research and Financial Engineering: 3.69  \nPolitics: 3.69  \nHistory: 3.69  \nElectrical Engineering: 3.67  \nPsychology: 3.66  \nChemistry: 3.66  \nEnglish: 3.66  \nSociology: 3.65  \nAnthropology: 3.65  \nEconomics: 3.64  \nNeuroscience: 3.63  \nArt and Archaeology: 3.63  \nCivil and Environmental Engineering: 3.61  \nPrinceton School of Public and International Affairs: 3.59  \nGeosciences: 3.58  \nSpanish and Portuguese: 3.57  \nEcology and Evolutionary Biology: 3.54  \nMolecular Biology: 3.54  \nArchitecture: 3.52  \nMechanical and Aerospace Engineering: 3.50\n\nn=466.

            "comment": "Honestly, your student will be fine majoring in any STEM for pre-med.  The pre-health advising at Princeton is strong, and Princeton has a good rate of success for its med school applicants.  Getting clinical hours will be important, and that can happen during breaks rather than during the semester, since semesters tend to be very busy for students, especially if they are involved in extracurricular activities.  Research is also important, and Princeton is a excellent place for that:  the junior and senior year independent work will be enough, although your student could also do a summer or postbacc year doing research at the NIH, for example.  \n\nSummers could also be spent internationally on a global seminar, or doing some sort of healthcare related work.  It's probably also good for a med school application to have some of the distribution classes address health care policy and cultural awareness.   Being able to interact with all sorts of people, from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences, is vital for someone interested in medicine, and med schools look for this.\n\nMed schools these days do look at the whole person, so extracurricular activities can be significant, but really should be something your student enjoys and finds meaningful or fun.  Mine did OA and that of course includes some wilderness first aid.  But mine did it not for a premed application but because he loves hiking, finds beauty and peace in nature, likes leading and instructing groups, and loves working towards positive group dynamics.  Still, it can be good for an app, but really almost all extracurriculars can be framed in similar manners.\n\nIf your student is interested in CBE, that's great and many of the requirements for the major will overlap with pre-med requirements.  Obviously, however, you student should only major in it if they are interested in it.   One of my students was pre-med for a bit, as a physics major, although he ended up deciding to go to grad school instead.  One nice thing about his having taken a bunch of physics before orgo was that it was pretty easy for him to understand the mechanisms of it so he didn't have to get by on brute-force memorization.\n\nFor academic success, it is very, very helpful to go to office hours.  Office hours for many STEM classes are not just to meet individually with a prof to ask a question, but are group sessions to go over problems.  Also, study groups are helpful for many students.  \n\nTLDR:  CBE is a good department and the requirements for the major will meet most of the pre-med requirements.  It's a strong major for pre-meds.",

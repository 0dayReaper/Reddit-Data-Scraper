    "postText": "hi everyone! i am a high school senior who applied to regular decision for Princeton. I am a valedictorian, and have an application that I would consider strong. I had pretty high hopes for getting into a top school. After I turned in my apps, I committed plagiarism in my assignment for a class. My teacher reported it to my counselor and she had to inform all the schools about this. The letter she wrote had somewhat of a positive light because she mentioned how I faced this issue strongly and had a lot of grit and how that makes me an even better student for their school since I went through adversity. I am incredibly remorseful for my actions, and I understand the seriousness of it. I turned in a letter talking about what happened and why, and what I learnt from it. Are all my chances ruined? Should I just be prepared to go to state school? I worked really hard from the last 4 years, and altho it isnt a valid excuse, the stress got to me. Please let me know what you guys think of my chances now! Thanks so much!",

They don\u2019t need to make an exception for an outstanding student with a history of plagiarism. They have countless outstanding students without any adverse academic history. \n\nBut the good news is that ivies are not the be-all-end-all. You can be as successful as you want to be coming from a state school. Don\u2019t despair. In five years, this will be a faint memory.",

This takes you far in life and builds your character beyond academics. If I were one of the admissions officers at Princeton, I think I'd take a chance on u for that.\n\nThe decision is for Princeton to make but if u don't get in, u can always go to another school for undergrad AND go to an IVY for graduate school. U can actually talk about this incident in ur graduate app and then share how u learned from this and persevered in your undergrad without any cheating.\n\nI know this is not ur plan and I hope u get into Princeton because we need more kids in the world who make mistakes but own up to them but if u don't, don't stress out and consider this the way your academic stars were alligned!\n\nGood luck!!",

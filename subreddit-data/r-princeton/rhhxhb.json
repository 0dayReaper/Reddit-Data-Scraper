But on a somewhat different note, I got a c+ in biology my first year after thinking I had nailed the final and it was a wake up call that I wasn\u2019t good enough at labs. I could have doubled down and gotten better and become a doctor like I planned , but I decided to play to strengths and go in a different direction. My career has been all over the place in a great and rewarding way, and I\u2019d say that one of the great privileges of going to Princeton undergrad is that as long as you find something that you excel at, whether a different field, or do something special after graduation or become lead clarinet in a symphony (not me but I hired someone with that profile), there are a surprising number of jobs/careers for people who take initiative to do something special.",

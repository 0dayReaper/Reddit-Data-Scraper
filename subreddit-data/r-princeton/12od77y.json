    "postText": "Average GPA (2021-22) is a 3.53 so it seems like to most people find that a combination of As and Bs is attainable. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s also partly a matter of pure academic prowess but approximately how many hours of studying per week did you have to put in to maintain your current GPA (whatever it is)?\n\nAlso are classes typically graded on a bell curve or on a point scale? And is anything above a 90 4.0 or do \u201cA-\u2018s\u201d like 90-92 drop your GPA? \n\nI\u2019ll be biology premed but feel free to answer regardless of major",

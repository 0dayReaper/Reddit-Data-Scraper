If I could talk to any students/recent graduates (particularly math or physics majors), that would be amazing. \n\nI haven't seen posts like this before, so I don't know if this is something that people wouldn't be willing to do, but if so, do you have any suggestions on where else to look?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "i went to caltech for physics undergrad. feel free to pm.\n\ni ended up fine. top grad school. but i still think i would've enjoyed princeton more. i think diversity is important especially in undergrad. i wish i met more non-stem majors (there are none at caltech. some people double, but stem is still their life)\n\ni also would've learned more if the school were easier. caltech teaches to the top 10% of the class. if you're below that, you may be able to keep up, but it's hard to internalize everything.\n\nthe biggest issue is you need to take 4.5 classes a term to even graduate, and most people take 5 courses a term. this is brutal especially considering we are on quarter cuz it ends up being 15 courses a year.\n\nat princeton the norm is 4 a semester (these go into more depth too because they are over a semester) honestly much more manageable. actually i take that back partially. caltech classes also go in depth, but you just have 10 weeks to do 15 weeks worth of material.\n\na famous example is ph106b, which is junior year electrodynamics. at caltech this courses is a shared undergrad and grad student course. so grad students from other schools are taking this as their grad version of electrodynamics, but we're all seeing it for the first time. caltech physics doesn't have undergrad versions of grad courses besides quantum. also, you, as a caltech undergrad, still have to take the grad quantum series.\n\nbasically, if you are truly in the top 10%, you will become so freaking good at physics at caltech. but its rough and i was probably in the top 25% and i found that if i had something slightly easier it wouldve been better (aka princeton). princeton is still hard. its not going to be like yale or harvard, or some non top school physics where you would lose utility by going there from how little you learn.\n\nits also easier to stand out in research labs at schools were the students are slightly worse (princeton instead of caltech)\n\nsocially, it's pretty good at caltech tbh. if youre a nerd you'll like it, but being around stem nerds all the time gets old by sophomore year. princeton probably teaches how to act like a normal person in society way more than caltech does. also the res college system at princeton is nice. princeton cares a lot about its undergrads so the experience is probably nice. people will complain about some admin issues but these exist everywhere, and you probably have it best at princeton.\n\nanyway, caltech was good and i made lifelong friends. i probably wouldve done princeton though if i could redo it.\n\nalso last point is that at caltech everything is take home tests, and most tests are open book, so if you have bad study habits this can feed into that. you feel like you don't need to solidly memorize material since you have the book. tbh i think some memorization is good in undergrad for foundational concepts because they will stick better in the long run. even if you forget them, if you memorized in the beginning, you will have an easier time relearning. in class tests kinda forces you to get good\n\ni was actually admitted to princeton for phd but chose not to go because the social aspects that make princeton special are mainly reserved for undergrads, not grad students,",

OR is sorta applied math haha so maybe I could help. \n\nTop comment is from someone who's super good at Physics, like actual try hard and god level to be like top 25% at Caltech. \n\nGreat! Now you can hear it from me, someone who's probably only average at Princeton. Kind of struggling all the time with mental health but somehow puts things together fast. \n\nIt definitely helped me to have a lot of options when Physics didn't work out. It just felt overwhelming when all the obnoxious smartass guys yell the loudest and make everything look super easy. I felt like I could never compete with the egos of some of my peers in Physics. I might've just met a bad batch in that one death mech class. There's always gonna be some that take themselves too seriously. (Khem. ECON majors.)\n\nOn social and culture, one of my closest friends is a grad student who's actively participating in a lot of the social events on campus. They're usually open to all. But yeah, you get to meet people that you would never expect to really get along with. Some people are so combinationally(?) witty, both in terms of knowledge, ability to react to new information, and also ability to make you feel seen, heard, etc. Math majors speaking like Psychology majors type feel. Healing, inspiring, and also funny.",

College social structures are much different from high school. There\u2019s a lot of social stress, but not in such an antagonistic sense",

There are schools that have higher suicide rates and there are likely schools with lower rates. Bullying I would not say is a widespread issue at all. I'm sure there are cases of it, just as there are anywhere, but in general wasn't widespread in my time there.",

            "comment": "no one is really addressing bullying, because it isn\u2019t super explicit. \n\ni would say bullying can exist here on different levels. in certain eating clubs, people can be very very explicitly rude, to the point of swimming like they\u2019re stereotypes in high school, and clique-y (dm me for more info). it isn\u2019t the shove-nerdy-kid-into-locker type bullying though lol, there are very few, if any, people that go out of their way to be assholes to people they don\u2019t know/people that are not super involved socially.\n\nprinceton just has very clear social lines drawn, which isn\u2019t bullying, but definitely has an impact on student life. your role in that can be self-made for the most part (bicker is a problematic process, and definitely favors more outgoing, upbeat, socially connected people), some people definitely get through the cracks in a good way though!! \n\nas for depression, i think mental health struggles are acknowledged on campus between friends as a common occurrence and going to therapy or being on anti-depressants or other meds is pretty normalized. i don\u2019t, however, think a lot of people talk about their deep, darker mental health struggles that keep them up at night and haunt them during certain situations. i\u2019ve only had deep convos about this with VERY close friends, and sometimes other friends will jokingly say \u201cthe social anxiety is HITTING\u201d, or something along those lines, but they say it in a joking way to mask the actual struggle and anxiety behind it. so basically, there is that recognition, but an understanding and appreciating of those struggles is lacking (especially by university admin).",

            "comment": "Depression: extraordinarily common, and I would strongly advise against reaching out to university services for mental health support. The de facto response to any issue is \"have you considered taking a year off and coming back when you're better?\"\n\n(Not saying don't go to therapy, DEFINITELY DO, but the actual University is not your friend here, and can be actively detrimental.)\n\nI went to McCosh to talk about managing depression at one point, and ended up having to follow up with my college's dean and convince him that I was actually fine, my issues were resolved, I didn't need to take a gap year. \n\nA personal friend had to deal with a similar situation resulting from a creative writing seminar paper the teacher considered disturbing (on the topic of a school shooting.) Had to make a case to the dean about how they were actually mentally fit / it was a misunderstanding / they didn't need help or time off.\n\nYou have to understand that the University as an entity is invested in protecting itself first and foremost, and the well-being of its students is a secondary concern. Suicide rates are fairly low because for anyone showing obvious signs of struggle, there are processes in place to identify them, and push them towards getting help...while away from campus / avoiding the possibility of negative press from an on-campus incident. \n\nA decent chunk of people I know did not graduate in four years, due to situations like this. Many of the rest dealt with (or still deal with) functional alcoholism as a coping mechanism for stress and depression. This is less of a problem than it might be at other campuses due to the fact that the primary way people drink is at eating clubs -- for free, in public, and monitored by people who are trained (and legally liable) to make sure nothing too bad happens. Plenty of stomachs get pumped, not so many actual deaths from alcohol abuse. \n\nBullying in your stereotypical Mean Girls sense isn't particularly present, but cliquishness, drama, or social stratification are absolutely a thing. It's fairly easy to opt out of, for the most part, as long as your social circles don't overlap too heavily with the bicker clubs / groups particularly skewed towards the wealthy and privileged, but even organizations like the band can be subject to ingroup / outgroup dynamics. I wouldn't call Princeton any worse than most slices of human civilization on this front, to be honest, it's just a little more brazen about some of the separations, where \"popular\" might entail \"invited to summer at the Forbes heir's mansion\"",

            "comment": "There's little in here to suggest you'd have a particularly good chance at getting into Princeton. \n\nThere is quite a range of schools between NJIT and Princeton though so if NJIT is perhaps not aiming high enough, it's not clear why Princeton would be the next step. That's not to say you wouldn't get into Princeton, but based on what you described, the chances don't seem particularly good. Your SAT scores are not great and you don't seem to have any serious extracurriculars. (You say you don't have time, but other high school students performing as well or better academically don't necessarily have any more time than you yet fit in all sorts of meaningful extracurriculars.) None of this is meant to make you feel bad, just to be realistic about your chances. Again, consider focusing on other schools that would come in between NJIT and Princeton. For example, have you considered Rutgers or Drexel in Philly?",

Maybe you have a 5% chance of getting in? The acceptance rate is really low lol, and it\u2019s mostly high performing students who apply. Only way to find out is to apply next year, it can never hurt (unless the application fee is too much).",

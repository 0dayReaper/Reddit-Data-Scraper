    "postText": "Hey r/princeton! \n\nI am an astrophysics student from germany currently taking a course on the interstellar medium (ISM). Our professor recommended us the book \"Physics of the Interstellar and Intergalactic Medium\" from Bruce T. Draine. I found a PDF to the book but I learned that there is also a smaller book with some exercises and solutions which I was unable to find but would be extremely helpful to have. I saw that the book is available in Princeton, does maybe anyone here has a copy of it (PDF or bookform) or knows what I'm talking about and could maybe help me out in any way? \n\nBest regards and stay healthy everyone!",

    "postText": "Disclaimer: Hi! I realize that this post may be slightly annoying since it\u2019s for an incoming freshman student, but I\u2019d really appreciate any insight you guys might have on Princeton. Thank you so much and sorry for the inconvenience!\n\nI\u2019ve recently been accepted to Princeton, Stanford, and Columbia, and am having trouble deciding between the three schools (It\u2019s the most fortunate problem I\u2019ll probably ever have, and I\u2019m still in disbelief right now lol). I\u2019m a humanities/artsy person who\u2019s planning to major in history/urban studies/architecture/art history, but in general, I\u2019m still pretty undecided. I\u2019m also thinking of a career possibly in law, architecture, public service, or some creative field, but I\u2019ll definitely attend grad school in some way in the future.\n\nCost of attendance is the same for all three schools, so money isn\u2019t really a deciding factor. \n\nI wanted to ask you which college you would choose given my position and if you had any input on what Princeton is like? \n\nFrom what I saw and researched virtually, I think Princeton\u2019s campus is absolutely gorgeous, the courses/professors here are just amazing, and the undergraduate-focused nature of Princeton is a huge plus for me. In addition, the unparalleled alumni camaraderie, the student traditions, and the rich history of Princeton are really attractive to me right now. \n\nHowever, I\u2019ve also been primarily concerned about the student culture/vibe of Princeton, as I\u2019ve heard that it does lean towards high stress, unfriendliness/toxicity, and other characteristics that probably all Ivy League schools share to some degree. Moreover, I\u2019m wondering if it would be better for me to be in Princeton, which I heard is pretty quiet, compared with New York City and Palo Alto in terms of location. I\u2019m hoping you can allay my concerns and share your experiences with these issues. \n\nI\u2019ve been racking my brains at this decision for the past week, so any help would be a godsend. I'll be visiting Princeton through the Princeton Preview program, so I'll be making my decision in the next few weeks. Again, thank you so much, and have a great rest of your day!",

Both were great in different ways. I think the stress issue will be similar at both schools.\n\nColumbia doesn't have much of a campus. You'll be straight in the heart of New York City.\n\nPrinceton is a decent residential town not surrounded by anything else. The town is walkable from campus.\n\nPalo Alto is also a suburban town but it's better connected to other interesting towns nearby via Caltrain. It takes a 15 minute shuttle or a very long walk to get to town from campus.",

It's so cool that you attended both institutions. \n\nI live in California currently, so I'm pretty used to just year-round sunny weather. There's a high possibility I might come back to California after grad school b/c I love it so much, but I'm primarily looking forward to attending somewhere with a different environment for my  undergraduate years. \n\nI applied to Princeton as a history and art &amp; archeology major, and my career aspirations include law or architecture/urban planning (still pretty undecided about this as well RIP). \n\nWould you say that Princeton as a town gets a bit stuffy after a while? It's really beautiful as the classic New England town, but it is a lot smaller compared to Palo Alto or NYC.",

Although maybe it seems that way from California. New England is everything up and to the right of New York State.  I don't think it feels like you're in New England when you are in NJ. \n\nWhile Princeton provides a *lot* of activities for students to enjoy on campus, so they don't feel they must go away to find interesting things to do, for someone with strong interests in architecture and urban planning I'd think living in NYC (museums, buildings,...) would provide so many more opportunities than being in Princeton.  While you can easily get to NY or Philly from Princeton by train, the trip there and back still does take a while and will eat up a good part of the day.",

I'm not sure I ever though Princeton as a town was stuffy, but it wasn't that interesting. About 1-2 times a month I'd take the train up to New York and sometimes down to Philadelphia for big city experiences, which was good enough variety for me.\n\nI came back right afterwards because my job is in tech, the weather, and because my family was nearby. But I definitely enjoyed my time over there.",

The grad students are a minority and relatively invisible. This really sets Princeton apart from just about everywhere else. \n\n2. Stanford: Climate!!! Palo Alto has to be one of the most beautiful places in the world to go to college and live. And that has to make a huge difference in experience. \n\n3. Columbia: New. York. City. There\u2019s no place like it on planet Earth. Whether that\u2019s a good thing for you or not should be a major factor in your choice. Also keep in mind that if you dig NYC you\u2019re a train ride away if you got to Princeton. \n\nThere are many factors but these are irreducible differences between these three fine institutions. \n\nIn my personal opinion, Princeton wins it. But that\u2019s me.",

Princeton by far has the prettiest campus imo, but it\u2019s no city, as you say - only you can decide whether that matters to you. NYC is NYC, and I would have found it overwhelming to go to school there, but I like being able to go occasionally by convenient &lt;1.5 hour train. I suspect the level of stress/toxicity etc. is the same at all three.\n\nPrinceton is much more campus-centered than the other two - we do go into the city occasionally, but most people live on campus and eat their meals there. Stanford has high numbers of people living offcampus, and Columbia kids spend a lot of time in the city. Just different. Visit them all if you can.\n\nArt history and history here are excellent, dunno much about the other departments you\u2019re interested in. Feel free to ask any more specific questions you have.",

            "comment": "I would recommend thinking about what matters to you in your college experience. For example:\n\nDo you care about being a part of a community? Princeton probably has the most close-knit community of the three. Stanford is MASSIVE and the undergrad population is also dwarfed by grad students. Columbia\u2019s location in NYC often drowns out any sense of on-campus community because most people just go and do stuff in NYC outside of class. Princeton has the undergraduate focus of a small liberal arts college with the resources of a top research school. You\u2019ll run into people you know while walking around (but you won\u2019t run into them *too* often, because there\u2019s just enough size to facilitate that).\n\nStress will probably be the same at all three schools. But I will say that Princeton\u2019s workload is nothing to scoff at. Our teaching semesters are shorter (12 weeks), compared to most schools\u2019 15-16 weeks. Stanford\u2019s quarter system is obviously a lot though too so\n\nThe artsy/humanities departments at Princeton tend to be a bit smaller compared to the larger majors, so you\u2019ll get good faculty exposure. Moreover, Princeton\u2019s JP and Senior Thesis guarantees that you\u2019ll work with faculty and contribute research to your field.\n\nThe uni offers a lot of great resources outside of the classroom too. Plenty of money is thrown towards student activities. If you\u2019re on any aid, you\u2019ll often be able to get some funding for study abroad or summer programs. We also benefit heavily from the alumni network in that many alumni will take on students to intern for them. I got to shadow an alumni physician over winter break, for example.\n\nPeople complain about the eating clubs but imo as long as you don\u2019t invest your entire social experience into trying to get into the best eating club or \u201cnetworking\u201d, you\u2019ll probably have a great time. On nights when they\u2019re open, there\u2019s always at least 1-2 eating clubs open to everyone. Make friends through clubs and activities and you\u2019ll do fine.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth I also really appreciate the campus beauty and historicity of this place. It\u2019s a special feeling walking through McCosh Hall for the first time and seeing the stairs worn down so much because of how long students have walked up and down those steps. You can go to the classroom Einstein taught at! Nassau Hall is nearly 300 years old! We have an old ass cannon buried in Cannon Green! It\u2019s so cool.\n\nThat\u2019s a good summary but let me know if you have any other questions!",

I saw in another comment that you lived in CA, and while I'm not sure where in CA, hopefully visiting Stanford isn't too difficult. Princeton and Columbia are across the country from, but the good thing is that they're not too far from each other, so if you go there then you can knock both of them out in succession.",

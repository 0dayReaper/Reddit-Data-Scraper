I am enrolled in another university but There are some classes I would really like to take at Princeton. More like an exchange student. Or visiting student. \n\n&gt;I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to send a polite email to the professor who taught it last or the department head but I wouldn\u2019t expect much\n\nThat's my tought initially. I would send an email tomorrow about that. \n\n&gt;but I wouldn\u2019t expect much. Perhaps the professor who taught it last could point you to the class resources and syllabus from 2019\n\nPossible.  The course limit was 20 places. And only 8 students enrolled for it at that time. It was Mr Ronnie Sircar who taught it at the time. \nWould really love to do this one.  But I don't know if the weak interest shuts down the possibility to see the class in the near future. \n\nErratum on my side, the course actually took place during the fall 2020(still 2 years soon 3 years because it doesn't appear in the catalog for 2022-2023).

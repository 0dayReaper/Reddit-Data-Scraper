I\u2019d love to find a way to meet new people and make friends, so if there\u2019s something you\u2019d recommend that wouldn\u2019t look weird if you went alone that would be great!",

I feel like I hear about research groups going out for dinner and stuff; maybe from there you could meet more people \n\nAlso it wouldn't look weird at all to go to movies and town events on your own, but I'm not sure how good those events would be for making friends \n\nI know people who have made friends with the people working at the Labyrinth bookstore/various cafes just by being extroverted and striking up conversation \n\nFeel free to PM; I (24) will be around and living with a few roommates off campus (all current students)",

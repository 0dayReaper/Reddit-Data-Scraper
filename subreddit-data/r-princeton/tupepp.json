    "postText": "Hiiii everyone!!\n\nFirst, I'd like to express the humbleness and sense of welcoming that I received from all my points of contact with Princeton up until now, be it my coolest Princeton interviewer, the admissions office through email, and the amazing current students that I previously contacted before applying.\n\nMoving on, I am a low-income international candidate from Morocco who has been waitlisted by Princeton, applying for music production and economics, and several other colleges. And I have the following questions for current students who have been in the same situation as mine---being a waitlisted international. I'd equally love to hear from waitlisted, later-accepted internationals if possible. I'd be the most grateful!!\n\n1. Where should I send my updated material, LOCI, and other supplementary updates about my application?\n2. Is it worth sending one extra recommendation letter on the behalf of another teacher or not?\n3. Should I contact current professors at Princeton at my intended major, as I saw a student doing here in this sub?\n4. And, finally, should I update my interviewer as well?\n\nI am well aware that the chances of getting off the waitlist for schools like Princeton are extremely slim, even more so for intls. But hey, I am shooting my shot and see what comes out.\n\nThank you so much for reading to this point. I utterly appreciate your time :)",

I'm super into that stuff, but couldn't exactly find it.       I wish you the best of luck in getting off of the waitlist.",

            "comment": "I would say always check the flavors and the line. I don\u2019t wait in line half an hour for anything. If there is a line I go to Ollson\u2019s for cheese instead or to Olives for a coconut macaroon or Chez Alice or Little Chef for pastry (little chef closes in the afternoon though).\nI have not been back to Thomas Sweet in about 5 years. It was great 30-40 years ago. \nHaving said that the Bent Spoon is the best ice cream I have ever had. Their sorbets are sublime. They make fruit taste better than the best fruit I ever tasted. \nI have no issue with the price. Whether is ice cream a sorbet, their treats are so divine I savor each bite. I end up consuming less (either because I share or I put the leftovers in the freezer for later). In the end, I\u2019m not spending that much more than for the cheaper stuff. I do have an issue with the line, the frequency of the days they are closed, and most especially recently the staff. \nDuring the height of Covid, the Bent Spoon served outside and the staff was kind and courteous.\nBack inside, the staff has become rude and snotty and act like we\u2019re about to give you a piece of heaven and if you want to be in heaven, you must go through hell. It is so unnecessary. Olson\u2019s is expensive too and have equally fantastic products, but the staff they are so polite and helpful and I feel great about spending money and supporting that small business.",

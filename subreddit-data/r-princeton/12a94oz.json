    "postText": "I recently got admitted to both Princeton and Yale and was wondering if there\u2019s any advice anyone can give on choosing between the two. I am interested in Neuroscience/Molecular Biology and the possibility of going to medical school.\n\nAny advice on choosing between these two? Is grade deflation really a thing that can affect me? How small is the town at Princeton?",

Also, I\u2019d take the grade deflation thing with a grain of salt. Not only is it no longer a policy here, but med schools are also familiar with Princeton\u2019s grading.",

Extremely unorganized, teaching not directed toward undergrads, etc. In fact, I\u2019ve heard directly from a neuro student at Yale that they would not recommend it to any incoming students. \n\nGrade deflation is dead, but Princeton does definitely grade harder. Med schools know this, but don\u2019t entirely forgive it, so keep it in mind",

            "comment": "&gt;However, elite colleges with merely above-average earnings pepper the bottom of the rankings. The most surprising is Yale, which comes third in the popular US News rankings but seventh from the bottom by this measure. Yale\u2019s students are statistically identical to their Harvard counterparts. Yet its alumni made \u201cjust\u201d $66,000 a year\u2014$4,000 less than those of Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania\n\nWhere\u2019s best? from TheEconomist https://www.economist.com/united-states/2015/10/31/wheres-best",

All of my online orders are showing delivery dates later than the exam day and it's not available at any other public library including the one at my university. On Google the hardcopy is showing available only at Princeton. If it's possible can I borrow it from someone here at Princeton and return it back the next day? Ebook and printed copies are not allowed by the professor.",

I\u2019ve seen three contradictory headlines:\n\n[One saying that the referendum has failed](https://jewishinsider.com/2022/04/bds-referendum-appears-to-fail-at-princeton-university/)\n\n[Another calling it disputed](https://jewishjournal.com/news/united-states/347047/princeton-bds-referendum-vote-in-dispute/)\n\n[Yet another has confirmed that the referendum has tentatively passed](https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2022/04/usg-election-process-referendum-discussion-princeton-caterpillar-results-boycott)\n\n\nI\u2019m aware of the gist here \u2014 there\u2019s controversy as to whether abstentions count against the majority. I\u2019ve read that the leader of Tigers for Israel had (allegedly) been told that they do, whereas the current claim is that they do not. \n\n\nSo, what does this mean?",

Do you think this is the case?",

With very few exceptions, students graduate in four years. Princeton is very cohesive in that way. Everyone I knew in my class who qualified for advance standing opted not to take it. \n\nThe biggest advantage of AP credits at Princeton is being able to get to the more interesting classes more quickly.",

If there is an AP class that is not listed but falls into the category, you could likely make a case for it counting. \n\nYou won\u2019t miss out on anything by not taking the exam.",

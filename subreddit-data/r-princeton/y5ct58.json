    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI was wondering if anyone here had any tips on ways to help me get accepted to Princeton. I\u2019ve been eager to go to Princeton my whole life, and my uncle who went to Princeton has always been a huge inspiration to me. I\u2019ve visited Princeton dozens of times just to talk to people and walk around the campus, and I\u2019ve fallen in love with it, and I\u2019ve sort of just believed that one day it would be my school. But then it hit me: the acceptance rate is crazy low and I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s special about me to get me in. If anyone has any little niche tips to include in my application I would greatly appreciate it, I\u2019m open to PMs.",

    "postText": " I am taking Algorithms course and I'm unable to use algs4.jar. I keep getting this error when trying to compile and run RandomWord.java:  \n$ java -classpath algs4.jar RandomWord.java  \nRandomWord.java:2: error: package edu.princeton.cs.algs4 does not exist  \nimport edu.princeton.cs.algs4.StdIn;  \n\\^  \nRandomWord.java:3: error: package edu.princeton.cs.algs4 does not exist  \nimport edu.princeton.cs.algs4.StdOut;\n\nI added the jar file to the project structure and IntelliJ could find the library and auto add import statements when I used the methods, but I'm unable to execute the file. Could someone help with this problem? Thanks!",

            "comment": "Copying overview of Forbes from another comment:\n\nNow, the annex. People love to hate on the annex. You know you're in the annex if there's an 'A' in front of the room number. The annex has cinderblock walls, so it can look a bit weird. One side of the annex does not have air conditioning (A140-170 and A240-270), and it gets stuffy and disgusting. However, the rest of the annex is air conditioned. Annex rooms are also quite large compared to main inn rooms. The majority of rooms in the annex, as with most of Forbes in general, are doubles, but there are some rooms that are sort of triples: basically a double and a single are connected, and they share a private bathroom. In my opinion, these are some of the nicest little rooms in Forbes. The most annoying thing about the annex would be the communal bathrooms, simply because the showers are this weird polygonal shape that are sort of small and take getting used to. Overall, though, the annex is honestly fine (unless you're in the non AC side. That side sucks.) It has a nice little courtyard and it's almost never loud at night, so you can party and come back to a quiet area.",

No AC though\u2026 but wasn\u2019t really an issue TBH as long as you bring a fan. \n\nI got the bed by the window which also helped with the heat. Good enough size for two freshman, but I\u2019d recommend getting bed boosters so you can have more storage under bed (like cubes etc) and if you can, a way to boost the bookshelf on top of the desk but not taking up desk space. Not really any room for a big TV or whatnot but there are enough common spaces it\u2019s fine.",

Cinderblock walls, somewhat small, and far, but Forbes is great, and especially your freshman year you don\u2019t want to be in your room all day. Looking back on my year there my room was tiny, but at the time it seemed fine. Don\u2019t have unrealistic expectations, but don\u2019t worry too much either. It\u2019ll be fine, and trust me, it\u2019s better to start in a not great room and get a good one in later years than to go the other direction, lol.",

(although not every room on the hallway is a single). I also liked it because there\u2019s a pretty good view, close access to the kitchen, and you\u2019re far away from any construction. So not all bad!",

Relative to Princeton, they are a little worse from the outside BUT the folks who live in them end up being super close. Also you can walk to meals without walking outside which is nice!

    "postText": "When I visited Princeton's campus I was struck by how serene it was. I imagined that if I ever ended up there, I would be extremely happy because of its beauty, and of course its brandname. \n\nOne thing I've noticed as I've read about experiences at Princeton is that while some love it, others... don't. I've seen complaints of social stratification and people who feel very isolated amongst their peers.\n\nI guess the thing that's most important to me is a sense of community and belonging to wherever I end up. I know that most people will definitely feel that while at Princeton, but I'm curious about the experiences of the people who don't.\n\nSo, /r/princeton, what's your experience? Are you happy? Could you tell me about people you've known who weren't happy and why? How about times when you've seen/felt exclusion or stratification?\n\nThanks",

            "comment": "My first (because of the stress of adjusting to a new place) and last (because of my thesis/job search panic) semesters at Princeton weren\u2019t great, but most of the time in between was awesome. I wouldn\u2019t say that I fit in on campus in general - I\u2019m black, went to a Title I high school/received a full Pell grant, and in general didn\u2019t fit the preppy/upwardly mobile stereotype that was predominant in a lot of places on campus. I spent my first semester feeling really self-conscious about the fact that my clothes were all from discount stores, I\u2019d never been to Europe, and my parents aren\u2019t/don\u2019t know anyone important.  However, I quickly got over that, because I absolutely loved my classes and I met a great group of friends. We all ended up signing into the same eating club and had an awesome time there. I graduated 8 years ago, but I\u2019m still really close with my core group of college friends and see them all the time. \n\nThe really unhappy people I saw at Princeton generally fell into two groups. One group had preexisting mental health issues that were exacerbated by the stress of being on campus, or they were really invested in entering the more \u201cexclusive\u201d segments of campus life (bicker eating clubs, dance groups, etc) and got worn down by rejection. Some people fell into both groups. \n\nI think the keys to being happy on campus - and honestly, probably just being happy in life) are: building/finding a community of people who like you for you, developing healthy coping mechanisms for stress/depression (aka going to see someone at the health center, exercising, getting enough sleep, talking to your friends etc), and filling your days with activities that you are inherently interested in, as opposed to things that you feel you need to do in order to impress people or check off a box on a to-do list.",

I definitely struggled with certain aspects while I was there, but I generally had a great experience apart from the stress. I was also an athlete and had an on-campus job, so juggling the time management side of it was definitely tough.",

It's all about who you choose to be friends with, and my friends are incredibly intelligent and incredibly humble. I find it an honor, to be frank, to be among such distinguished people here. I know some people aren't happy because of the intense academic pressure, but mostly, to get into Princeton you must first be academically qualified. I love it here, getting to mingle with and build relationships with some of the most qualified people in the world.",

Be honest with you, over the course of my first two years here this place absolutely destroyed my mental and physical health. Very long and personal story short, I took a year off, got a bit better and am generally navigating Princeton much better now than I have in the past. \n\n\nIf I knew then what I knew now, would I choose go here again? Fuck no, all told, it's still been pretty shit. The values and interests of most of my peers do not align in any significant or meaningful way with my own, and I find it very difficult to relate to most of them for this reason. That being said, do I hate it here enough to transfer? Again, no - the benefits I'm afforded by being associated with the Princeton name do a considerable amount of work in offsetting the bad and at the end of the day I still really do enjoy the \"school\" aspect of Princeton itself.",

It looks like the academic pressure is real but that you can find your people if you look.  Agree?",

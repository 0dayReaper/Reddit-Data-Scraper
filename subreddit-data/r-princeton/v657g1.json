    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm an incoming freshman, and I was wondering if any of you have taken the Latin placement test. I'm not sure exactly what to expect, and I was also wondering how well I would have to do to place out of Latin entirely.\n\nI've taken Latin since the 7th grade, but unfortunately I wasn't able to take the AP exam because my hs didn't offer APs. I'm really hoping to place out of Latin so that I don't have to worry about my foreign language requirement.",

The first was comprehension (what this means, case, function, one-line answers or brief responses). The second was straight translation. Pretty much aligns up with AP style questions imo. Hope this helps \u2014 good luck!",

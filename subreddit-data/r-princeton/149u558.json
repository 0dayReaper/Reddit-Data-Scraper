However, along side those things I also want to know what you would do if you had the opportunity to redo freshman year to optimize your experiences and achieve as much as you possibly could.",

If you are truly a top student and not just a gunner, the heads of the colleges will reach out and point you towards the fellowship office that can guide you:  [https://odoc.princeton.edu/advising/fellowship-advising](https://odoc.princeton.edu/advising/fellowship-advising)\n\nThe best thing about Princeton are the people you're there with.  Make the most of your time with them - it goes far too quickly.",

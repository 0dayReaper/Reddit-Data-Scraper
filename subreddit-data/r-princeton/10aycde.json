    "postText": "Hello fellow princetonians, \n\nI am a grad student who loves very complex board games, and my white whale is the game Twilight Imperium. It takes 4-8 players and 6-8 hours, so I'm never able to convince anybody else to play it. I am looking for fellow students who are willing to invest half a day into a sci-fi political war game. Please DM me if you're interested. Thank you for your time.",

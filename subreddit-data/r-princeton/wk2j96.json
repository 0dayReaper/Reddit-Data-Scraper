            "comment": "Maybe others could reply below to make this a thread, but a few notable jobs and my thoughts:\n\n1. Library worker: fine pay (i believe ~$13/hr), very easy/light work. Extra perk is you can do schoolwork during most of the shift since they\u2019re pretty slow. Applications are not very selective\n2. Research assistant: ease of getting one varies widely across departments (from my experience, getting a paid research position in PHY, AST, and CHM is pretty tough), but it can be very nice to get paid to do something that you probably would want to do anyways. Pay is usually around $13-$14. These jobs are pretty selective, even in departments that offer them.\n3. Princeton Student Agencies executive/associate director: requires you to take on a lot more responsibility (you\u2019re literally running a small business, including hiring staff, managing finances, marketing, building relationships with customers, etc.), but it can be very rewarding, both as a job and monetarily (pay is $16/hr). These jobs are only relatively selective, but they\u2019re only offered up at the end of the school year since it\u2019s a one year term.\n4. Princeton Student Agencies staff member: obviously this varies widely since there are so many different agencies (coffee club, direct to door, safeguards, onestudio, etc.), but these can be very good jobs to have since the directors are students (and try to be flexible since they understand that school is hard to juggle). Pay is usually around $13/hr, and agencies are almost always looking for more staff members so applications aren\u2019t very selective.\n5. Dhall worker: I don\u2019t know anything about this job but here it is\n\nHopefully this helps!",

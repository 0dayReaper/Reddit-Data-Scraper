It's super troublesome to take public transport (takes twice as long) and I want to bring my car to princeton so I can drive back. However, I know that it is very rare for princeton to grant parking permits. Does anyone have any advice?",

Either that or go look on tigertrade/Craigslist/Nextdoor and people in the surrounding neighborhood sometimes rent out parking spots at their house at a monthly rate.",

It\u2019s a bit of a hassle but I park my car in west garage during the day and move it onto the street at night. You may be able to park in west garage for extended periods of time if you park on the 3rd or 4th floor, I doubt they check up there.",

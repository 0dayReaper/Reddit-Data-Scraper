The math department  suggests other paths for those interested in math who are not coming in with an especially strong background. \n\nPrinceton has a fantastic math department for those who want to study the subject. Would you advise people not major in physics too?\n\nFor the OP, a supplementary text that might be attractive is Lara Alcock's *How to Think about Analysis*.",

Math and physics majors have surprisingly little utility in the corporate world - physics probably has more due to applications in the defense industry / hard sciences - but if you're passionate enough to pursue a PhD or enter academia, then the majors are great.\n\nFrom my perspective, I was under-prepared for MAT 215. Despite having the usual 5 in AP Calc BC / Statistics, I had almost no exposure to proof-based courses, and didn't last long in the major. My academic advisor was completely oblivious to this dynamic and generally useless. The experience more or less killed my passion for math.",

Please don't take others down or give unwarranted, biased advice, and maybe try to not project your failures/shortcomings onto others. Princeton has one of the best (if not the best) Math departments. It has tons of resources to support its students, both majors and non-majors alike. Just because *you* had a bad experience in the class or the math department as a whole does not mean you have to fight futilely against a tidal wave of statistics, accolades, and world-renowned faculty that prove the Princeton Math Department is one of the top-notch departments at the university and around the world.

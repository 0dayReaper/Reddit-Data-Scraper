    "postText": "Hey ya'll! I'm an upcoming student at Princeton intending to do a BSE in MechE. In high school, I took AP Chem, but received a 2 on the exam (oof). I didn't take Physics 2,  Physics C Mechanics, or E&amp;M (school didn't offer), but I took AP Physics 1 and received a 5 (as far as I know, this doesn't matter, but let me know if I'm wrong). I'm hoping to skip out of the chem requirement (chem 201 or 207) and maybe even the physics requirement (physics 103 and 104), and I was wondering if I'm still allowed to do the STEM placement testing for physics (since I didn't take Physics C) and for chem (since I received a 2 on the AP exam). I looked at the website and I still need some clarity since there are quite a few conditions that they mention. \n\nIf I'm eligible to do either exam, what resources do you recommend I self-study with, and what textbooks does Princeton use for these courses?\n\nAlso, I'm eligible to do the language placement exam (took Spanish for 4 years),  and I was wondering what sources I should use to refresh. \n\nThank you!",

As it was, I wasn't really prepared for the intensity and rigor of a college mathematics class and starting with one I'd already kind of done would have been a boon.\n\nBest of luck!",

            "comment": "Congrats on being accepted! Skipping out of intro classes is a good idea. I placed out of physics through placement exam, chemistry through AP, very glad I did. Be aware that physics placement test is very difficult, much more difficult than AP physics c, which already is quite challenging. Your experience in Ap physics 1 probably won\u2019t be comparable, to feel comfortable, try the MIT OCW physics materials. It is not easy to place out unless you are very comfortable with physics, plus, if you are MechE, you probably want a strong physics background so sticking with intro classes might not be a bad idea. \n\nFor chemistry, I used AP credit so not sure how difficult the placement exam is. Would recommend emailing the department head or the chem placement officer (find it through the website), my guess is you should feel very comfortable with the AP chen material.\n\nAnyone can take the placement tests, regardless of class background, just beware they are quite difficult.\n\nBSE kids do not need a foreign language so it is not necessary to place out of language if you are set on BSE. I tried French after taking a couple years of French and with a 4 on the AP test and basically bombed, it is quite specific on grammar and comprehension. If you somehow manage to ace it, I believe you will need to do an interview to officially place out of the 100 level Spanish classes. In other words, very difficult again.",

                    "comment": "Adding onto this, it\u2019s important to note that AP Physics 1 is algebra-based physics (PHY103 and PHY104 are calculus-based), and only covers like 3/4 of PHY103 (it doesn\u2019t include Kepler\u2019s laws or waves, and just generally has less depth) and none of PHY104 (which is electricity and magnetism, electronics, and optics). You may be able to self-study to skip out of PHY103 (I\u2019d recommend reading Physics for Scientists and Engineers by Tipler and Mosca if you choose to do so), but I agree with @bc_127; biting the bullet and taking them will probably serve you best in the long run. Your future Princeton classes will require a very thorough understanding PHY103/104 material.",

    "postText": "Can someone speak to this?\n\nAfter filling out the incoming student survey, I just have 1 question: Why is the University so bizarre about inclusion? About half the questions were about identity, privilege, and inclusivity, but why do they care if they will not change anything?\u00a0\n\nThe Uni recognizes that eating clubs are a massive part of campus life (they said 2/3rds of upperclassmen are part of one for food plans) and also acknowledges that they are not inclusive. They have a .edu website where they even endorse this message of having an obtuse and frustrating social hierarchy. Every single student will tell you that the majority of the events at these eating clubs are invite-only, discriminatory, frat-like types of things. This sounds exactly like Lord of the Flies in the sense of being socially isolating. I honestly feel bad for the incoming class of black and/or international students, as the university directly endorses clubs owned by rich, white people that engage in discrimination.\u00a0\n\nIf they acknowledge these clubs are discriminatory, why hold up the facade of being \u201cinclusive\u201d? Just pick a side. It is just bizarre hypocrisy. Am I wrong or is this indeed just immature behavior?",

Half of the clubs have bicker, which is kind of like rush (minus all the hazing etc. that is associated with Greek life), but the other half are non-selective. I bickered (and was hosed, or rejected), but it was really completely bland and nontoxic. Now I\u2019m in a sign-in club and am very happy. Eating clubs aren\u2019t that bad - compare them to Greek life at most US universities (which serves a similar function) and you\u2019ll see they\u2019re pretty healthy. A couple of clubs (like 3 out of 12) are vaguely problematic, with a wealthy or white or jock stereotype, but they are still so tame compared to equivalent things at other schools. Every university needs places for big parties and access to alcohol, and eating clubs are like the least problematic way of filling that niche, which is why the university lets them continue.",

            "comment": "The eating clubs are a big part of campus life out of history and tradition but they\u2019re not owned by Princeton, so they\u2019re not something immediately reflective of the values of the university itself nor something that the university can immediately axe. They do have an intricate relationship with the university though, having an interclub council, a graduate council, and university liasons to the eating clubs for regulation of events and training student officers. I do think that the admin would get rid of the eating clubs if they could based on restrictions imposed throughout my time here + proposed university efforts to claw students back away from the eating clubs, but they seem to balance that with the fact that most of their donors are former eating club members who definitely won\u2019t want to see their eating clubs go away any time soon. I can imagine the eating clubs will only really die out from financial/membership problems like the ones that have already closed.\n\nThe eating clubs still have a ton of problems. There are multiple that are not aligned with or run by rich white people (as far as undergraduates go), but that doesn\u2019t make the fundamentals of the eating clubs okay. I would say they\u2019re getting better. If you want nothing to do with them it\u2019s entirely possible to have nothing to do with them.\n\nPrinceton balances being proud of what it is and its history with the fact that the history and systems aren\u2019t based in equity or inclusivity. It\u2019s a dance between money making and interest in human/social rights + health.\n\nI\u2019m not really trying to make a point so much as relay my observations, I guess.",

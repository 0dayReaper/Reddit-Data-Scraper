    "postText": "Welcome to the first installment of the weekly admissions megathread! From here on out, new threads will replace the old on Sundays at 7:00 am, eastern time. Keep it civil and constructive (that goes for students/alumni, too) and we'll see how this goes.\n\n**Applicants:** Post all your admissions-related questions and comments here (both undergrad and grad). **Admissions posts/comments outside of this megathread are subject to removal.** \n\n**\"Chance me\" posts are subject to removal** **anywhere, including here** \\- we are not admissions officers, and every application is unique. No one here (or in the chance me subreddit, for that matter) is qualified to comment on your chances of admission.\n\nOther helpful resources:\n\n[Princeton Undergraduate Admissions site](https://admission.princeton.edu/)\n\n[Princeton Graduate Admissions site](https://www.princeton.edu/admission-aid/graduate-admission)\n\n/r/ApplyingtoCollege\n\n/r/gradadmissions",

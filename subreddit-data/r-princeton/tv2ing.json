    "postText": "  \n\nHi guys, I was recently admitted to Princeton for Mechanical Engineering, I was also admitted to UCB for Material Science Engineering as a SEED Scholar. I would appreciate your thoughts on where I should end up committing? I don\u2019t qualify for fin-aid so it\u2019s the same cost wise for both. \n\nPrinceton Pros \n\n\u00b7 Crazy amounts of prestige \n\n\u00b7 Undergraduate focus and more resources/student (Princeton has the highest endowment/student among any college)\n\n\u00b7 Tight Knit community, something I value coming from a small high school \n\n\u00b7 Flexibility to change major easily \n\n\u00b7 Better teaching, access to professor and one-on-one attention \n\nPrinceton cons \n\n\u00b7 Location could be better, NJ is cold \n\n\u00b7 Ranked lower for engineering, but still considered one of the best among the ivies?\n\n\u00b7 All the stuff you hear about elitism \n\nBerkeley pros \n\n\u00b7 Amazing location \n\n\u00b7 Ranked well for engineering \n\n\u00b7 SEED Scholarship gives me benefits like priority enrollment \n\nCons \n\n\u00b7 Overcrowding underfunding \n\n\u00b7 Relatively less prestigious \n\n\u00b7 Teaching is worse (TAs vs Profs) \n\n\u00b7 May not be able to switch EECS (tho im not deadest on it, I like the flexibility)",

            "comment": "Unless you place a lot of weight on living in the Bay Area, go with Princeton. I've worked with a couple of people who went to Berkeley and their consensus is that the size of the school means teaching isn't as personal, and that engineering programs definitely have a set of \"weed-out\" classes in order to whittle down the major size.\n\nAt Princeton, MAE usually only has 40-60 student cohorts, so weed-out classes aren't a thing and class sizes can be much smaller. All of Princeton's engineering programs are excellent, so picking out ranking differences is kind of silly. Princeton is also a beautiful place - it can get cold (and will likely feel that way if you're coming from SoCal/TX/The South), but I came from WI and I actually thought it was pretty warm.\n\nIn any case, congrats on your admission, and feel free to reply or dm with any follow up questions.",

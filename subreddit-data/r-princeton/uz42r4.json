I emailed a person from grad student housing on May 20th and heard back from them on May 28th. They said they received a lot of new incoming graduate students and that I should receive an assignment in a week. 2 weeks pass by, and still nothing. I emailed again on June 11th to know what\u2019s up, and they thanked me for my patience, and said to keep checking the housing portal for updates lol. Currently have my fingers crossed.\n\nEdit: plus they mentioned that it\u2019s on a rolling basis even though I applied before the deadline.\n\nUpdate: Logged into portal on 6/13 and noticed I\u2019ve been given an assignment. No email yet.",

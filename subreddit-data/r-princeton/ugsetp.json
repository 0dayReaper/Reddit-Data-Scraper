A Princeton degree may be useful at private aerospace companies. \n\nBut, a Princeton degree still holds value and will open doors for you, just giving a heads up that it\u2019s not quite the landscape you think it is out there. State schools hold a lot of clout at government aerospace companies. And people may think you are over-qualified coming into it with a degree from Princeton. \n\nSource : Princeton PhD from the MAE department.",

Go in with the interest, sure, but don't hesitate to flex as you learn more.\n\nTo your question, ignore other commenter (undergrad is vastly different than grad), there are Tigers in all manner of aerospace, public and private. Not sure if you get access once you start or only after graduation, but either way hit up Career Services office and ask them to check the alumni network for people at companies or organizations you might be interested in (Boeing, JPL, etc.). Get contact info and reach out for a quick chat. The networking could be good to circle back for internships later on too.",

Some people change major because the (absurd) grade deflation policy means they will get lower grades at more challenging courses that are nonetheless very important, like advanced math. So they leave those courses early in the term, change to \"easier\" stuff, never challenge themselves in the way that's necessary for real development and achievement. Take those courses even if it starts looking like you'll get suboptimal grades; it's much better to take them and admit to yourself that it will take maybe years to fully assimilate the material, rather than giving up your dream as a whole, in my opinion.",

    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI was recently accepted into pt and will be joining the class of '26. I've been studying up on APs but I'm not sure which ones I need to take/give me credit. \n\nDoes anyone know the difference between units of credit vs princeton courses replaced? I got a 5 in AP US History but what does \"one unit of AP\" give me? I'm considering taking the European history test this Friday but unsure if it means anything? \n\nbtw I'm planning to study in the engineering department. idk if that helps\n\n[https:\\/\\/odoc.princeton.edu\\/advancedplacement ](https://preview.redd.it/a7jxex94bbx81.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4491eb4264ba5a145f312fcf27c850838870c272)",

            "comment": "if an AP test has \"no equivalent course\" under the \"courses replaced\" column, it means that it does not satisfy any course requirement (i.e. it doesn't take the place of any course). an example of an AP test that _does_ satisfy a requirement is a 5 on AP chemistry, which you can use to replace CHM207 (meaning you don't have to take CHM207 at all).\n\ni believe that a \"unit of AP\" is applicable if you plan to take advantage of advanced standing, which allows you to graduate in &lt;8 semesters.",

I\u2019m guessing similar rules apply to AB students. This is the only way you *reduce* your course load, otherwise \u201ccourses replaced\u201d simply means you meet a prerequisite and can start at a higher level (none of these courses in your image meet this, but something like Calculus can \u201creplace\u201d MAT 103 and you can start in MAT 201). Sorry this is math focused but that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing lol",

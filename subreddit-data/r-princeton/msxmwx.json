Is he like a normal student there tho like he goes to class like the rest of us. Would be crazy to meet him since he\u2019s like the best bullet player in the world and one of the best in chess overall\n\nJust wondering if I\u2019m going to be seeing him daily or if he rarely shows up since he already has his own career",

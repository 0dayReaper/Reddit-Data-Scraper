    "postText": "Hello :)\n\nI am an intl student and so will not be able to visit any of the campuses. I really love English, and am also interested in maybe doing politics at harvard or hist &amp; diplomacy at princeton.\n\nI really love princeton's campus, residential system and how quiet it is.  The only things I'm worried about are the academic intensity and stress, and the exclusivity of eating clubs. Are they really that bad?\n\nMy parents are pushing aggressively for me to pick harvard because it's HaRvArD, and i don't know if i have the energy to fight them :/  I don't like the campus, and i don't like how busy it is.\n\nwhat reasons would you have for choosing harvard over princeton, or vice versa?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthank you to everyone who replied :)",

I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s an international recognition thing but really, you won\u2019t be missing out on anything by choosing Princeton. \n\nSure, academics are stressful. Regarding eating clubs, there are \u201csign in\u201d clubs that are non-selective and you simply choose one of those. \n\nPrinceton is known for its undergraduate focus (no medical school, business school, etc) and senior thesis.",

            "comment": "I\u2019d also say Princeton being so undergrad focused makes it less competitive and stressful than Harvard, based on my experience at Princeton and friends\u2019 experiences at Harvard. Not saying stress doesn\u2019t exist at Princeton, but especially if you aren\u2019t pre-med or ORFE at Princeton, it\u2019s easy to avoid high stress and competition. \n\nEating club exclusivity isn\u2019t anything to worry about! Harvard has its own exclusive clubs also, I think, haha. For eating clubs, you\u2019ll likely end up wherever your friends are - whether that\u2019s a bicker club, sign in club, co-op, or 4 year res college. \n\nMost important is to pick somewhere you are comfortable and excited to be. No doors will be closed because you picked Princeton over Harvard alone :)\n\n(I had the same choice, picked Princeton, and have no regrets!!)",

From what I\u2019ve heard from Harvard friends, stress/intensity sounds pretty similar to Princeton.\n\nEating clubs have some issues, but it\u2019s no different from Harvard\u2019s clubs (and it\u2019s much better than heavy Greek life, as found at most other universities). A few are elitist and not very diverse (in race/wealth), and a few are very rowdy and frat-like, but there are several that are non-selective (if there\u2019s room, anyone who applies gets in, and if not, there\u2019s a lottery system), and are pretty diverse and unproblematic. Just join one with your friends (or don\u2019t, if you\u2019re happy in the dining halls/as an independent), and it will serve as a place to eat and party and socialize.\n\nPrinceton and Harvard are very similar in terms of layperson prestige in the US, although Harvard has a slight edge there. The most popular college ranking, US News and World Report, has Princeton as number 1 though. What really matters though is how it\u2019s perceived by employers and by other universities, and they consider it equal to Harvard.\n\nPrinceton has the largest endowment of any university in the country per student (Harvard\u2019s endowment is larger, but they have many more students). The undergrad focus thing is real - Princeton\u2019s lack of professional schools (law, medicine, etc.) means the community is a better size and you\u2019re more important to the administration and to faculty.",

            "comment": "Harvard is definitely more hands off with its undergraduates and as a result it has less of a strong community. At Princeton there is a lot more attention to undergraduates and you really feel like the professors are here to help you and you can get a lot of individual attention. Academic intensity and stress is real for sure but I\u2019ve talked to a lot of students from other colleges who go through similar experiences: tldr college is hard and it can be harder or easier depending on the classes you take. Imo as a frosh eating clubs are not something I know a lot about but bicker is definitely a toxic process - there are a lot of non bicker eating clubs though so it\u2019s not something you have to go through",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm a senior in high school and I was wondering how the foreign language req works? I don't really like foreign language classes and wouldn't major in it, so I'd like to only fulfill the req. In high school I got a 4 on the AP Spanish lang test, but my understanding is that I need a 5? In terms of placement tests, I probably wouldn't do the best since I forget all my Spanish over a few months of not learning it lol.\n\nThanks!",

You are right, you need a 5 on the test to be exempt. \n\nThere is a placement exam to determine whether you can skip the 101 / 102 type courses for this, but I think the time to take that for this year has passed. \n\nIncidentally, most elite schools will have similar requirements. \n\nhttps://odoc.princeton.edu/advancedplacement",

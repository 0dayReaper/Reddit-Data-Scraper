    "postText": "Hello, all - Fellow alum here who has recently moved back to the area. I'm really enjoying being able to walk through campus again (especially on beautiful days like today), and in visiting Nassau Street for a coffee or hoagie... quick question for those of you who still have tabs on the social scene in the area - **is there a venue where you would go to catch good local bands?** To be clear, I'm not looking to spend _ANY_ time in the basement of TI, haha... I'm 40 years old with 3 children. Specifically, something off-campus where I wouldn't be considered a creepy older dude having a beer and catching a show. I used to play in a few bands when I lived in NYC, and love live music. For more context, I also did a lot photography and music recordings in my time in the city, and would like to help out some local talent however I can. Would appreciate any input. Thanks!",

    "postText": "Hi! My buddy is an alumn and I'm just crashing for the weekend. (May 25-28). On the grad student budget, I can't swing the &gt;$1000 pricetag for the weekend but we can still pay for a bed or two if anyone visiting or a resident/student has a spare at that time! Any leads would be super appreciated \ud83d\udca5\n\nAbout us: I'm a PhD student in California, studying media, writing, and technology. Interested in arts of all kind, philosophy, and getting into festival culture over here on the west coast. He studied geoscience, journalism, and machine learning, is working at a startup, and is just generally a fascinating and kind person.",

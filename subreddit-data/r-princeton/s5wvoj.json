    "postText": "If you're like me, starting a new semester of college means bracing yourself for stress-induced OCD flare-ups. It means struggling to complete homework without engaging in compulsions or having an anxiety attack. It means feeling misunderstood by friends, classmates, and professors to whom your challenges are invisible or incomprehensible.\n\nI want this semester to be different. I want to have a support system. I want to support others and be supported by others who are pursuing an education in the face of OCD symptoms and a global pandemic.\n\nIf you are a Princeton\\* student who has OCD and would be interesting in forming/joining a support group or group chat, please PM me. We do not have to suffer alone.\n\n\u2013an undergrad at WashU\n\n\\*Students from all colleges and universities are welcome \u2661",

    "postText": "I know a lot of us are on here stressing about getting our housing assignments. I emailed housing asking when I might expect to get my housing assignment and this was the response I got:\n\nIncoming student housing offers have just started to go out. All assignments should be sent by mid-June. Housing has completed assignments for current students and is now sending incoming student assignments and expect to have them sell sent out soon. Housing was occupied with reunions, commencement, and start of summer housing activities, which is why the offers have been slightly delayed.\n\nJust wanted to share if the info helps any other folks feel less stressed, apparently they\u2019ve got the assignments they\u2019re just sending them out slowly for some reason",

    "postText": "Does Princeton look more at your school rank or your class rank. I go to a magnet school and would say I am at the top 10 for about 40. Do I have a lower chance because I go to a tougher school with a lower class rank compared to someone who is at a public school with a higher class rank?",

            "comment": "I'm pretty shocked that a school that small ranks its students.  My kids' school had about 125-145 students per class year and didn't rank.  On the school profile, however, it did present a general data set showing what percent of students had gpa's in the various ranges.  The Princeton admissions office usually has a pretty good handle on the characteristics of specific schools.  Don't sweat it.  You can't change what high school you go to.  Be curious; enjoy learning; be a kind and considerate classmate; work hard; let yourself shine in your own way.  Wherever you end up, make the best of it!",

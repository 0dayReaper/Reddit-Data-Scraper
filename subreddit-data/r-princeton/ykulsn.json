    "postText": "I'm a freshmen planning to major in CS. While I do want my degree and the opportunities associated with it, I don't particularly care about learning the theory or diving deep into content. To be completely honest, my biggest priority is elsewhere, but I still do want to hustle for a degree in CS. I'll do Leetcode for internships. \n\nI'm coming in with moderate background knowledge, having taken up to calc 3 in hs and did some programming on the side, but never devoted myself too heavy. What is the path of least resistance? Specific classes to take? How to avoid the worst ones?",

I'd recommend finding a major that actually interests you and getting a certificate, you will still be able to leetcode your way to internships. \n\nThere's no getting around hard classes either way. Most people find even the prereqs very challenging.",

            "comment": "I fully agree with what everyone else said here. However, if you are fully set on doing this, here are some pointers. Note: you actually don\u2019t give us any valuable info which we could use to make a recommendation here. Do you have most of the BSE prereqs completed from high school credit or will you be AB COS? Are you currently taking COS 126 this semester or next semester, etc. The latter is probably unanswerable given your post history.\n\nThe path of least resistance depends on what you're good at. If you've completed all the BSE prereqs, then BSE is easier than AB since you don't have as much independent work junior and senior year. If you're not a full-on STEM person, AB COS will probably be much easier. For course planning, visit this link: [https://www.cs.princeton.edu/ugrad/class-of-2025-departmental-requirements](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/ugrad/class-of-2025-departmental-requirements). I recommend taking COS 333. Note that you only have to take one true theory course, and there is no \"easy\" COS course.\n\nIf you do get into Princeton, look into advanced standing. However, the Princeton curriculum is not something you can just race through nor would it be fun to graduate a year early for whatever reason you originally had in mind.\n\nWith that said, Princeton is probably the worst place to rush through a computer science degree ***especially*** if you are not interested in theory.",

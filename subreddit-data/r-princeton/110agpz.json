Could anyone please explain why triples and quads are of the same price as single rooms? Shouldn't they be cheaper if a room is shared by 3 or 4 people? \nhttps://hres.princeton.edu/graduate-housing/current-graduate-students/room-and-meal-plans",

You'll often see this style of dorm be called a \"suite\" in US colleges, though I haven't seen that term used here.\n\nThe pricing in OGC is honestly kind of nonsensical, with two rooms of drastically different sizes sometimes going for the same price. You might get lucky, you might not. (I've heard this is because OGC is so old that some of the rooms were meant for students' personal servants. No idea if that's historically accurate but it would explain the inconsistencies.)\n\nAs a first year, you're most likely going to end up in either OGC or NGC if you don't have a partner/family/medical exemption/etc. In NGC, there's just singles, which is a perk if you don't want suitemates, but the bathrooms are shared by \\~5-10 people on the same floor. Also, \"new\" is somewhat of a misnomer - it's newer than Old Graduate College, but it was built in like the '60s.",

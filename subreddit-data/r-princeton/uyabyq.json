    "postText": "Hi I'm 25, male from the Princeton area and I'm looking to co-work /study at the library or cafe with anyone else who might be available any times from 1pm to 5pm weekdays or weekends. \n\nSummer can be a lonely time on campus so I figured it would be make sense to post this\n\nAbout me: I'm into technology and business growth. I like listening to podcast about venture capital and artificial intelligence. Self driving cars and other technological developments. I also enjoy nature a lot and do a fair amount of nature trails. Aside from that I have really just been exploring my home state of New Jersey a lot more as of late. Finding the hidden gems in the state is kind of fun like really good restaurants and unique stores\n\nI'm relatively extroverted and rather calm. Also in the process of making a technology social group where we share cool articles and discuss them in person and online. I like to build things especially things that bring people together. Have already had a decent amount of success with this and will continue to do it. I also have a pretty large network of friends already and would be happy to include you in some of the things we do if we vibe together. DM me if you want and we can talk a bit and exchange social media",

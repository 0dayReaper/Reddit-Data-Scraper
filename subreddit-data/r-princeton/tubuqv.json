I would think more about do you want a small campus, size of class, living off campus, etc. \n\nIn terms of cost, I would also consider costs of living off campus in future years at Columbia, assuming the $8k at Princeton includes room and board. I would also definitely reach out to Princeton\u2019s financial aid - they are great! - and see if they can do anything to help make it less of a difference.\n\nBoth are amazing schools.",

If you ask me at this point it\u2019s not about whether Princeton is better than Columbia, but rather which has better programs for that specific degree. 32k is not that much if your career is going to be exponentially better somewhere else.",

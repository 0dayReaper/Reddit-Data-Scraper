    "postText": "I just got a contingent verbal offer from a IT defense company that has a secure facility where I would be working on campus next year. \n\nIdeally I am wondering if I would be able to do the following: \n\n1. Be able to use the gym\n2.  Get involved or go to campus activities\n3. Eat at the different restaurants on campus\n4. Use the library \n5. Some type of housing deal/perks within walking distance to the site\n6. Take Classes (discounted or free?) \n\nAny insight on how various contractors work with the school would be great.",

You wouldn\u2019t probably be able to like join clubs but a lot of events like dance shows or games or theater are open to the public if you buy a ticket, so you could!\n3. Not at dining halls but yes to anything else like cafes on campus or first campus centers food hall\n4. Not sure\n5. Don\u2019t think so (not sure there are any) - maybe access to a housing webpage?\n6. I don\u2019t think so but you could look into the community auditing program?\n\nCongrats on the job offer!",

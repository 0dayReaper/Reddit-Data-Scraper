Can you take courses outside of the your department?\n\nIs it pretty much not possible to get into 300 level courses? How common is it that grad students take 300 or 400 level courses? Is it easy to get into them?",

Yea I think language courses are usually allowed but I wasn\u2019t sure about like cos or ele courses that might be limited enrollment, especially if they have lab components. I guess the large lecture classes that are 300 level are fine but the others might be hard?",

Often times for research you'll want to learn specific applications of a field so taking an entire overview course may not be helpful.\n\nIf you are just interested in learning about a field in a structured way, then for sure take the classes though.",

I like Princeton a lot but I\u2019m worried it might not be the right choice for premed given the lack of a medical school (for hospital shadowing,etc) and other premed opportunities.",

My feeling is it\u2019s very hard to get a great GPA at Princeton when you\u2019re taking hard chemistry and MOL classes, although clearly many people do. If I were premed, I would rather have gone to a more grade-inflatey or easier school. That said, Princeton has great opportunities for research that are hard to get elsewhere, and if you manage to maintain a high GPA that will look more impressive at a hard university like Princeton.\n\nThe lack of super close medical school/hospital isn\u2019t great, but tbh I don\u2019t think most premed college students have a ton of free time to shadow during the school year anyway. Just do it over breaks/summer. As mentioned by someone else, there\u2019s a great volunteer EMT service that a 5 or so students join each year - big time commitment, but great opportunity.",

But med schools are aware of this. Princeton\u2019s average GPA of accepted med school applicants is around 3.5-3.7, which is not impossible to make happen.  If you\u2019re smart about picking classes and don\u2019t just go for the most difficult ones out there like some students are wont to do, then maintaining a decent GPA can be possible.\n\nThere\u2019s also a ton of programs outside of classes that pre-meds can take advantage of, to include easier access to research opportunities due to the stronger undergrad focus, mandatory research opportunities in the form of the Junior Papers and Senior Thesis, the Global Health Program which sends student abroad over the summer for research or clinical experience, the Princeternship program which allows for good shadowing opportunities of physician Princeton alums, and a local EMT organization that takes a ton of Princeton students for volunteering.\n\nPrinceton has enough resources that you can definitely do some exciting things, if you\u2019re willing to put in the work.",

Beyond requirements, what do you recommend students have? For reference, I\u2019ll be taking two science courses(chem and bio), a creative writing course, and ASL for my language.",

For other classes, if you prefer handwritten notes I\u2019d recommend a multi subject notebook so fewer things to carry. Or set up OneNote on your laptop! \n\nThings I found I used more in college were a small notebook for quick notes and a todo list. I used onenote for class notes.",

    "postText": "First time poster and I know I don't go attend Princeton but I figured this was the best place to ask about Ivy League schools. I'm a senior about to graduate from a Midwest university and was looking to be part of psychology research labs around the country during my gap year/s before applying to grad schools. While I have an extremely high Psych GPA (practically a 4.0 if we ignore one class during the pandemic), I have a lower overall GPA because of just terrible life circumstances and then recognizing I don't want to go into medicine anymore (3.23 rn) and the only research experience I have is the independent research study I'm conducting during my senior year, acting as PI and first author. I can get strong letter of recs and I have been emailing professors all over the country asking for positions and informational interviews and have gotten responses that tell me to ask again in the Spring, but also open to discuss more.\n\nI'd like to think I'm quite personable and educated but I'm afraid to apply to any positions at any of the prestigious schools because I feel like they'd just look at my surface level information and drop me from consideration, compared to the other applicants who've probably done much more. I just want to be given a chance but I don't know how the psych department at these schools is about accepting students and how open they are to such things.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience or advice in this field? I would really appreciate anything and sorry if this is not where I should be posting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a psychology major with a Visual Communication minor btw. Open to questions or other comments.",

Casual conversations about what you're interested in and building a relationship with a professor in the field is always a good move. Then maybe ask about it after the zoom or if it comes up naturally. If they tell you to wait, at least you have a foot in the door. \n\nI've also found most professors here are very friendly and willing to chat if they have the time. Make it low stakes and casual!",

That's exactly the tactic I was starting to use with some of the other professors from other universities but I was worried that it won't work for the more prestigious schools as the professors may be too busy to actually care to meet with me. But this makes me feel better, I love talking to people and 'interview' like settings anyway, and I will get to emailing them ASAP! :)",

            "comment": "Hello I'm a grad student here so I can probably give a slightly more informed answer than others.\n\nI know a few people who do lab-tech style work at labs here, it's not too hard to get such positions. Princeton takes very few grad students and so the professors are often in need of extra help with their research. It's quite common to do such things at other institutions as well (a lot of people I know did \"informal\" post-bacc research at Harvard, the Broad, etc). \n\nThere is no downside to reaching out either, really. If you're excited to work with the professor, even if they don't personally have a position for you, they might give you valuable guidance and it doesn't reflect badly on you at all to ask.\n\nMy only advice for reaching out is: actually read their recent publications. They are deeply familiar with their own research (obviously) and can tell if you half-assed your prep. I don't say this to intimidate you, if you don't fully understand some of their research just tell them that and they'll be understanding and excited to explain those aspects to you. Do not be afraid to look dumb, as long as you've made your best effort to look into their work and have genuine interest in it it will reflect well on you, no matter the depth of your understanding.",

I believe most PIs must be incredibly busy though, so do you think they will actually respond to me? Is there any specific way to ensure that I can get their attention and some time to discuss things? I don't want to come off as irritating either, I am just genuinely very interested in the work they do.",

If you have a professor that will vouch for you, get them to request meetings for you. Random emails from undergrads are not likely to be responded to. Current grad students are also often an option for getting your foot in the door so you might try emailing some of them.",

            "comment": "You\u2019ll have to take introductory math and physics classes, and you have the choice to take these either with the math and physics departments (MAT104 and PHY103 for calc 2 and mechanics), or with the engineering department (EGR151 and EGR152, engineering mechanics and engineering calc 2).\n\nThere are lots of benefits to the EGR sequence:\n\n* You may see some of your professors again when you declare your concentration/major\n\n* EGR professors are all experienced faculty whereas the lecturers/preceptors in the MAT/PHY department are hit-or-miss\n\n* The workload in the EGR sequence is also more reasonable (speaking from experience with the EGR and MAT departments)\n\n* The math department in particular is known for fairly brutal exams, being quick to assume academic integrity violations, and discouraging students from pursuing STEM if they\u2019re struggling with the math\n\nThe downside is that the problem sets you\u2019ll receive aren\u2019t usual textbook problems \u2014 you\u2019ll have to think outside the box and likely collaborate to do well. Be sure to try to get study groups going early into EGR151/152 so you can keep them going into the rest of the EGR sequence. \n\nAlso, this is unrelated but if you have experience with chemistry or physics from high school I hear it\u2019s well worth trying the relevant placement tests \u2014 it may free up a space for the computing requirement or an elective\n\nHope that helps",

Never saw a professor. Grad students did the classes and the grading, and it really dampened my first couple semesters.",

That will be really critical to be a well-rounded person imo, and also lets you experience a lot of different parts of the university.\n\nMany professors (both in engineering and outside of it) are very well-renowned in their fields. You\u2019re not going to have a chance to learn about some obscure topic from the literal expert really anywhere else, at least not as easily as you will at Princeton",

But iirc a lot of class assignments are done from the command line, and the most support is given with unix commands, which is v straightforward on an Apple computer. If you're using Windows/DOS commands, you may be more on your own. Though Windows 10 has pretty good support for running unix shells, it's still a bit confusing for me; this may not be an issue if you have a basic understanding of operating systems lol\n\n(This has also been my experience in classes in other departments with a programming component--there is more support for mac users than windows users)",

When, for example, COS 333 has you adding features to a Unix program from the 70s a Unix-based OS is just easier. In industry, Macs are dominant as well as developer laptops go so it\u2019s also a simpler transition if your plan is to go into industry. \n\nThe university has a laptop purchasing program by the way which I believe lets you get a discounted laptop if you\u2019re on financial aid.",

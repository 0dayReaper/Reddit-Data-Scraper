    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m a MechE senior and working on a senior design project. We plan on creating a window that simulates sunlight to be used in laboratories, offices, and workplaces where there are no real windows or very limited sunlight. If you work in a windowless environment or one with minimal sunlight please take 5 minutes to fill out our form. We are trying to better understand the stakeholders and what solution path is most beneficial to our potential users. \n\n[https://forms.gle/qpvRoZmD1tnSi3aS7](https://forms.gle/qpvRoZmD1tnSi3aS7)",

So, the project still has merit",

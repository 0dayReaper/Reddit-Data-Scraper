NCW/Yeh are hypermodern but are far from everything except the STEM cluster (jadwin, McDonnell, fine) and bio/neuro buildings.  \n\nforbes is far as fuck from everything else because it used to be a hotel. some have ac, others don't.",

For example, rocky and mathey have more ideal locations but aren't the nicest or most modern. Whitman is nice but currently partially next to construction. But you won't get to choose for yourself, so its probably not something worth worrying about",

Then you will get an assignment.  You do not get any direct choice at all.  You do not get to choose your roommates, room size or configuration, dorm, or residential college.  Do not sweat over this because you have no control over it.  Also, take other people's opinions with several grains of salt.  Some people want to live in the collegiate gothic buildings.  Some people prefer the new buildings while others think they look like a cross between a Hyatt Place and a corporate office park.  Some people never walked to school as a kid and never visited a really large campus so think that a 15 minute walk is far af.  Yes, be prepared to do a fair amount of walking.  You are going to be fine.  It's a beautiful campus, although like many campuses across the country right now, there is a lot of construction.  You are likely going to have roommates or suitemates and they are likely to be smart, kind, and interesting, and perhaps even a little anxious about college and this new stage of life.  Like you, probably, they will know few to nobody on campus and will be open to making friends.  Be open to people and experiences!  Make the best of whatever housing situation you end up with.  Congratulations!!!",

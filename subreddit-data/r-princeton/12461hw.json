Does anyone have any experience with this or can offer any advice on the best way to get the gift to them?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

Then mail your gift to the address with the following format:\n\n[Friend's Full Name]\n\n[####] Frist Center,\n\nPrinceton,\n\nNJ 08544\n\nThey'll get an email notifying them that they got a package and need to pick it up.",

Welcome to the family \ud83d\udc05 \n\nHere are some of my favorites\u2026 I tried to go for the little things in life! \n- Watch the sun set by the fountain at Robertson Hall\n- Go to hoagie haven right before it closes after a night on the street \n- Organize an exceptional group costume for Princetonween\n- Hit an arch sing for every acapella group \n- Take in a heavily discounted Broadway show through your res college \n- Finagle your way to dinner at Prospect House\n- Walk through the spring cherry blossoms on the back pathway to Frist\n- Get lost in the East Asian Library and Firestone stacks \n- Take an actual tour of the Art Museum. It\u2019s so legit !!\n- Try out for a dance team (even if your bad at dance)\n- Explore after the first big snow, bonus points if you make a snowman with folks from warm climates who have never seen snow like this\n- Pull an all night and walk to your dorm as the sunrises \n- Convince a preceptor to hold class outside (ideally by McCosh) on one of the first spring days \n- Study or take a class in the Dante Room in East Pyne\n- Go out after your first Deans Date \n- Go to every event for seniors during the year, go to reunions, and embrace every part of grad\ud83d\ude2d\n\nMost importantly, have fun, try new things, and make friends. Try not to stress too much on the little things. It\u2019ll fly by! Feel free to DM with any questions. \n\nFor unofficial merch, check out Etsy! Or eBay for discounted/vintage official merch.",

    "postText": "Currently looking into majoring in urban planning, I've also got some strong interests in game design and music composition. Is princeton a good place to learn urban planning while also upholding my other interests? I only have really cursory CS knowledge... is Princeton conducive to learning other things way outside your major? (For example taking classes to further my trombone playing and composition skills and learning about game design while also being an urban planning major?)\n\nI visited Princeton over spring break and absolutely loved it!\n\nExcuse me if this is a stupid question. Very new to researching universities!",

Princeton has a liberal arts and engineering focus, which means it\u2019s classes focus on the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering. It does not have pre-professional majors or classes. It would be worthwhile to look up what majors you would be interested in at the colleges you like.\n\nThe closest to that that Princeton has is the Architecture major alongside the Urban Studies certificate.",

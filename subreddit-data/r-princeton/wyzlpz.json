Ex: make your own fully automated drone for prospective engineering\n* Make a meaningful impact on your local community or some type of community\n\nDon't's:\n\n* Don't just start a non-profit to get into college. Make sure the non-profit (or company) is actually unique and meaningful\n* Can't really think of anything else. Honestly, the possibilities of ECs are endless so whatever you think of and put enough effort into will probably work (unless it's bigoted or something)",

You don\u2019t have to cure cancer or start a non-profit or publish anything. Do what you love, do it really well, and then cross your fingers like everyone else. Literally everyone who gets in is crazy lucky, no matter their grades or scores. Focus on the things that bring you joy and don\u2019t shy away from challenge and growth experiences. Try to tune out the deafening drama that surrounds this process and learn to focus only on the things you can control. Be yourself. Find your joy. Let it shine.",

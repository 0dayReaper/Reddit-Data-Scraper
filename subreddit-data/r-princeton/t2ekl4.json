    "postText": "I thought the cancel culture ended at California, but I guess not. If I am getting screwed financially by not being given a surplus, I at least don't want to be screwed ideologically.\n\nThis renaming does not even make sense for a few reasons:\n\n1 -- No one is perfect. We don't have MLK statues to celebrate domestic abuse or glorify violence against women (both of which MLK did). To cancel a man with a Nobel Peace Prize is especially odd.\n\n2-- The whole democratic party was racist at that time. Segregation did not start or end with Wilson. It began to end many decades later by the Supreme Court (Brown v Board).\n\n3-- FDR denied Holocaust victims entry to the U.S. and let them be part of the genocide. He also ordered the infamous internment of like 120,000 Japanese people. Like actually kidnapping Japanese people and throwing them in Nazi-style concentration camps. You do not see Harvard or Columbia condemn him for either atrocity. You could find lots of other examples of more henious ethical crimes done by political actors, but that is besides the point.\n\n4-- Harvard, Yale, Brown, etc. are named after slave-profiteers. Are we going to change everything ever? \n\n5-- Idiocy. I don't give a fuck about the nomenclature of the school (Woodrow Wilson School, now Public Policy), just give my money you idiot. Similar to how Hispanic-Americans are struggling with poverty while political actors debate why these groups really just want to be called \"Latinx\".  Like you need to actually do something to help people. \n\n6-- Aren't the elitest eating clubs just as racist/sexist/classist or whatever. Ban that too. Ban everything. The financial aid office treats low-income students like second-class citizens, so if anything, ban that. \n\nThat's all.",

Renaming Wilson college to First was a useless gesture, but since it\u2019s getting torn down it\u2019s pretty irrelevant. I don\u2019t think the university should be removing statues of Wilson or renaming other things related to him (at least as long as we aren\u2019t doing the same for slave-owning founding fathers), but the school of public policy renaming made sense.\n\nAlso, Gordon Wu is a bad guy, but not particularly significantly. He\u2019s a Hong Kong citizen who opposes expanding democracy there, largely for classist reasons, but I don\u2019t really see how that\u2019s any worse than anything that plenty of mainstream US politicians say all the time.",

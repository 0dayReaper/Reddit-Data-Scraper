    "postText": "Hey guys, class of 2026 here.\n\nI currently live in a mid-sized town with more of a suburban feel (no reliable/extensive public transport) and was really looking forward to taking advantage of public transportation when I went to college.\n\nHowever, I have seen some people advising incoming freshmen to take their cars--I believe their reasoning was that most of the surrounding areas and their amenities are relatively inaccessible/inconvenient to get to without a car.\n\nOn the one hand, I really don't want to pay for gas and insurance more than I already have to, but I also want to be able to go about my life outside of campus without too much fuss.\n\nIs it worth it to bring your car to campus? Is there even decent parking for students living on campus?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice. Regardless of what I decide, I'm super excited to see all of you this fall!",

It'll be a 10-15 minute walk to get to your car, and it will be expensive to park in a university lot (which are the ones that are 10-15 min away).\n\nI recommend just not bringing it for freshman year. You can always bring it later if you really find you need it (but I don't think you will).",

I lived 90 minutes away by car, but via train it was usually 3 hours since I had to take the dinky, NJT to Penn, then wait for the LIRR. If you expect to go home for fall break, thanksgiving, winter break, intercession, and spring break, plus any other random trips, then it may be worth it if the drive is reasonable. It occasionally was useful for going shopping at places like Target on route 1. There is no benefit to driving around campus since there\u2019s nowhere to park.",

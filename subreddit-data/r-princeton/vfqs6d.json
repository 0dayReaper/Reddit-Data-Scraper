    "postText": "Hey,\n\nI'm 21, living in Europe, thinking of applying to some US schools, including Princeton, this fall. I arrived at a point in my life where I kind of regret not applying after high school and want to appease my conscience. I had the kind of resume that could get me in. I did a gap year (in which I worked) and am currently enrolled at a prestigious uni in Europe in my first year. If I apply, I will do so as a freshman. Firstly, because I want the full experience, and secondly, because I won't have earned 100% of my 1st year credit due to not attending some classes bc of covid last winter. I am top of my class at uni.\n\nAnywho, my question -- is this feasible? Did you/ do you have any people such as myself in your undergrad class? Like, older, having done a gap year, etc.? I've heard it said before that some schools look for candidates like that because they're sort of like the \"yeast\" that binds a mostly homogeneous class of 18/19-year-olds together? I can totally see that because the experiences I've had these past two years have truly given me a different perspective and have changed me profoundly, and in a good way that would enable me to be a wholesome addition to a class of younger students. You say if it's actually done this way.\n\nThanks for your help :)\n\npeace \u270c\ufe0f",

            "comment": "Yeah, 3 or 4 years older isn\u2019t too abnormal - taking 1 gap year is super common, and during the pandemic many people took off another year, so there are lots of 20-year-old freshmen, which isn\u2019t too far off. I even know a couple of people in their late twenties or early thirties.",

I\u2019m a nontraditional student myself, and most of the nontrad students that come here do so through the transfer program, although there are a handful that apply through regular freshman admissions. \n\nIt really isn\u2019t abnormal to be a bit older than traditional students. Some of the oldest nontraditional students are in their 30s and 40s! I\u2019d recommend hitting up the admissions office to see if you would need to apply as a transfer or a freshman due to your college credits, but otherwise, nothing should stop you from applying!",

            "comment": "I did this a few years ago! I really enjoyed it; compared to things like OA/CA, you actually get to know more people, as there are opportunities to hang out with everyone who does it (like 50 people?) as opposed to only the people in your small group (\\~6 people). \n\nAlso, most of the people I knew from DDA ended up being quite involved with community service/activism stuff during their time at Princeton, which was pretty cool. \n\nI can be painfully shy/introverted so that was still a struggle for me, but even then I found other shy ppl and we hung out haha. So I imagine as long as you go in with an open mind &amp; positive attitude, you'll have a good time.\n\nWhen we did it, we stayed at a big campsite, and outside of the structured discussion time, there was free time to swim in the lake and do classic camp stuff",

            "comment": "I did this my freshman year, and I think it'll be a good time! If this year is 'normal' and not covid-impacted, you'll probably go off campus to a nice retreat area. My year, we went to a lakeside YMCA campground and had the benefit of outside/lake activities as well as working showers and decent cabins. \n\nYou'll get to know a pretty decent chunk of people and upperclassmen DDA leaders, which will be really nice for at least the first few weeks/months of your year. It'll feel a little like you know everyone. \n\nDay-to-day can drag a bit because you're mostly talking in large and small groups about social justice issues. While these are important, the discussion based format can definitely be a bit fatiguing by the end. \n\nEnjoy orientation! It's one of the busiest, and in my opinion most formative times, of your freshman year. (But no worries either if it's not - classes/clubs/res colleges/etc will all be immense as well)",

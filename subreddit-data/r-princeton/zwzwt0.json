    "postText": "Hello, all. I was admitted SCEA for this cycle and am pretty much planning to attend. For my AP scores, do I really need to send official scores for verification? (I will not be sitting for AP exams this spring) I don\u2019t want the credit and, like everyone else, had my SAT sent before the application deadline. Would appreciate the help so I don\u2019t waste cash.",

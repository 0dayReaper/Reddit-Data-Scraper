Personally, I don't think it's a big deal because every freshman is in a zee group where you can relatively easily make friends as long as you try. I had a double, but my roommate and I weren't that close after the first couple weeks anyways. I would've liked a single if given the choice.",

Everyone has their own preference. And I could see wishing you had a single if you aren\u2019t close with your roommate or if you don\u2019t get along!",

    "postText": "So for context both Harvard ([https://financialaid.hcf.harvard.edu/start-up-grants](https://financialaid.hcf.harvard.edu/start-up-grants)) and Yale ([https://finlit.yale.edu/getting/start-grant](https://finlit.yale.edu/getting/start-grant)) give students who they determine to be low-income a stipend of $2000 to settle in. Not only that, but they actually care about their low-income students. Yale meets the need for a computer for college with a loan of equipment. Princeton, despite the stupid Student Computer Initiative, says lmao who cares, best we can do is offer you a predatory loan. My question is this: Why the immense greed? More importantly, can I show this to the financial aid office so they can match them? I think its fair to ask that they match this financial support that these peer colleges provide if I am going to commit to the class of 2026. Granted, I am self-aware enough to know that I am grateful and lucky that I will not be expected to contribute to tuition costs or room-and-board expenses should I attend. However, is it wrong to ask for the same aid I would have theoretically got at Yale or whatnot? No, that's incredibly reasonable because Princeton is just as wealthy if not more so. The low-income resources, from my research, treat low-income kids like irresponsible idiots who need counseling and have mandatory participation if you even want to request things like a winter coat. They apparently trip over themselves to fund LGBTQ+ whatever and other elective events to look more diverse, but why not actually do what the students want? They have the money to do so, so why not actually at least try to care?",

It comes off as just being bitter.\n\nShould Princeton provide a startup Grant? Probably, starting college is costly, and they certainly have the funds. If you do decide to go to H or Y instead and tell them the reason, that could have an effect.\n\nBut there are options (FSI was already mentioned), in an absolute sense, you'll be fine, so there is no need to get mad at the support other students get.\n\nWorst case scenario, the loan is fixed 4% with deferred interest, no fees, and a maximum 10 year repayment period.\nhttps://finaid.princeton.edu/financing-options/student-loans\n\nDepending on your major, you are likely to pay that off before the end of the 9 month grace period after graduation and pay no interest.\n\nCongratulations on hitting one of the few golden tickets that can help a select few Americans escape poverty. I hope you can pay it forward as I'm trying to.",

That demonstrated a time when the university was unconcerned about people in your financial situation (something the person is criticizing in the post). Great for you that you got it, perhaps it fulfills your ego, but that's not fair and doesn't mean people have to face the same or similar. Working for the university, in my opinion, is something to give back for the unique opportunity of being there, as well as to ensure a more calm financial situation during your studies, rather than to'survive.' We must not take third-party critics personally and instead try to understand them in order to achieve a more equitable status quo. That does not imply that you must demonize something.",

It was a different time and the university had other priorities that it had to weigh. That\u2019s life, and in no way was it unfair. That Princeton\u2019s endowment has grown significantly since then makes today\u2019s generous financial aid packages feasible.

            "comment": "Re: winter clothing - I'm recently reminded that residential colleges typically hand out warm clothing/winter jackets as part of the free gear that any student can get. The EBCAO office also had free beanies and scarves this year, plus a trip to a local thrift store to prepare for winter. Anyone who had issues with funds would have been assisted by the office one way or another.\n\nGenerally, you can see from the article you linked that the funds Harvard/Yale have to give cash to students are from a specific contribution by donors. It's not really Princeton's fault that the donors for FGLI assistance at Princeton went into development of an office to supplement academic, professional and co-curricular development for students. They also help facilitate opportunities for growth, connections and provide mentorship. It cannot be described how the staff and community at the Emma Bloomberg Office for Access &amp; Opportunity will do anything they can to help you succeed, whether it's with your academic or personal life. With that, Princeton really has the most robust support system for FGLI students.\n\n\"Resources\" aren't just cash handouts, and Princeton has plenty of resources and care that you're downright disregarding in favor of cash. Teach a person how to fish, not give them a fish kinda deal. It's your loss if you choose to think that these optional development opportunities are idiotic.\n\nAnd no, unless you have an offer from Yale as well as a non-full-ride, just telling the finaid office that \"Yale has this\" most likely won't do you any good since like, you're not gonna go to Yale. They meet full demonstrated need, not full demonstrated want.\n\nBeing less obnoxious will also do you good in the long run :) We all appreciate free money but we don't walk around demanding it and publicly denigrate the ppl giving us free money.",

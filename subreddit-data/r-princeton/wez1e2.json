I suppose it's possible they might ask you to prove that you're \"ready\" to take the class.  In my case I was actively asked to take them by the people offering the classes, so I honestly had no idea the number of the class mattered at all. It was just \"hey you'd enjoy this special topics class I'm teaching in the spring...\"  \"...okay\"",

You also then can get the basics out of the way earlier in your career so then you can take cooler and higher level ones A) when you know more and B) when you get to select classes earlier and get into the best ones :)",

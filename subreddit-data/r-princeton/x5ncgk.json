    "postText": "I just moved into the annex and was wondering if anyone could help me figure out the etiquette on showering in the shared bathrooms. There's not really space to put clothes anywhere, besides the ground (gross) and I feel like it'd be weird to change in the bathroom. But at the same time I feel like walking down the hallway with just a towel around my waist could make people uncomfortable. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

Honestly, though, walking through the hallways in a towel is pretty common; you won't have any problems.",

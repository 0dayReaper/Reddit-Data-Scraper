Though, according to [this source](https://www.princetonianamuseum.org/reference/833929a2-767d-4188-bf63-0615d7ca257e), Jadwin Gym had one installed in 1974, and according to [this source](https://campusrecmag.com/proactive-pools-aquatics-risk-management/), the assistant director of aquatics for facilities and operations ([Jack Jephson](https://goprincetontigers.com/staff-directory/jack-jephson/1656)) at Princeton University references the school having one.\n\nSo, in other words, we might have one or might not \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af.

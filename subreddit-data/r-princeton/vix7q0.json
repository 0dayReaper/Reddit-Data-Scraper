    "postText": "I'm sure that many people in Princeton used to be the top in their high schools. No matter how hard a challenge seemed, you might always have had that sense of inner security that things will some how work out. You know that as long as you put in the hard work, you will do well. \n\nBut now at Princeton, you meet all these people who are simply another level of genius, and you can't even comprehend how they do the things you do. For the first time in your life, you actually feel completely loss. Be it a problem set or research question, where you don't even have a clue as to where to start.\n\nHow do you deal with these kind of feelings? Like for the first time, you aren't the best (well an ego issue), but more importantly, for the first time you realized that you don't actually know how to solve problems -- or at least the new kind of problems which didn't always seem 'trivial' as it did to you as a smart kid. Specifically research questions, where you are literally probing new grounds and no one really knows the \"correct answer\" ahead as well.",

You will get better and have a better time doing it. With hard work you will probably discover that you still have something to contribute even amongst 'geniuses'.",

It is a sign you are growing, and have opportunity to grow, and others to grow with. \n\nBeing at the top is nice feeling but has no head room either. Now you have an increased opportunity to develop and exchange ideas, learn and learn from and with others. \n\nCompetition can be healthy but too much comparison can be detrimental. There will always be someone ahead and someone behind. Sometimes it\u2019s you and it happens both ways. When stuck in comparison focus on self for a moment. \n\nKeep that inner security that things will somehow work out, that doesn\u2019t have to shift. Trust that and enjoy your time",

How to figure out what you want to be and how to get there, instead of just continuing to check the \u201csmart and successful person does this\u201d box as you may have done through high school. Princeton, both in its courses and environment, force you to pick a path, find out who you are, and who you want to become. \n\nIt can pinch a bit at times but it\u2019s what I carry with me to this day",

            "comment": "This is an important lesson to learn. Life is not like high school problem sets. Be humble and learn to work with other people (TAs, peers) to get by. Isolating yourself and just trying harder is not realistic. \n\nEveryone \u201chits a wall\u201d at some point and stops having the luxury of mastering the materials and switches to getting by in the class. For me it was quantum mechanics at Princeton. It is a distinctly different experience and a universal one unless you are a savant who never strays outside your comfort zone.",

The OP seems to imply that no one at Princeton struggled in their high school experience  and is now overwhelmed by the caliber of intellect at Princeton. I don\u2019t think that is the common experience for a Princeton student. \n\n(FYI - The OP has cut and pasted this exact post at the other top 10 schools.)",

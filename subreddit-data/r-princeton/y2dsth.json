Always down for hanging with the locals. \n\nmy google search just led to a lot of shade thrown the way of the nightlife here \ud83d\ude05",

            "comment": "A&amp;B is probably our best all around bar. It's solid, a tad pricy, but solid.\n\nIvy Inn is the go to for cheap beer and good times, but it's a little ways down from the main \"town center.\"\n\nYankee Doodle has a great atmosphere. Really has the Princeton feel. But you'll be paying extra b/c of that.\n\nNever had Winberie's but that could be worth a shot as well.",

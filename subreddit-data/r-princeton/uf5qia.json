Of course, classes are still difficult, but if you manage your time well and seek help early, you\u2019ll be fine. \n\nI don\u2019t know the % of people who drop out of premed (you could try asking HPA, our health professions advising office, for that), but anecdotally, the people I knew who dropped out of premed didn\u2019t really want to be doctors anyways and found their passions by being exposed to other fields at princeton. Hope that helps!",

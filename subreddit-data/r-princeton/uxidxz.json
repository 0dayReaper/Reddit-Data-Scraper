    "postText": "I'm going to be in Princeton for a semester, and I wonder if there is a platform (Facebook group etc.) where people can buy and sell secondhand objects, I'm thinking about bedsheets, clothes, furniture etc., (also I'd love to have a mini fridge in my room!) I think it doesn't make much sense for me to buy these things only to get rid of them after a semester. I'd be glad if someone knows something!",

Could anyone who is in the system request this box or request to have it scanned and get it back to me?  This would be a huge breakthrough in my work!!",

You should contact an appropriate faculty who can get approval for research if you're at another institution, I think you can also look at stuff on-site if you're approved as a library visitor.",

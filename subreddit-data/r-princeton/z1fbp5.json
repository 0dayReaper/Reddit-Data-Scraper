    "postText": "Whenever someone wants to do Advanced Standing, and graduate with an AB or BSE in 3 years, everybody discourages them, including faculty, administrators, and students.\n\nI find this frustrating. They say you\u2019re missing out on the college social experience, you only get to go to college once, learn from amazing faculty and with exceptional peers.\n\nOn the other hand, I see a college education as a necessary credential for social signaling, and as a minimum qualification for many career paths. I also like the ability to be part of the alumni network. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m not particularly enjoying my time in college socially or academically. I believe I can learn new skills on my own, and I would prefer to be in a high earning career as soon as possible, being financially independent and working towards career advancement. With that said, it\u2019s easier to understand why a student like me would want to get an AB or BSE as soon as possible.\n\nIn addition, I don\u2019t qualify for financial aid. This year the cost of attendance is around $80,000, and that is a significant amount of money for my family. By graduating in three years, my family saves a significant amount of money, while I collect the credential I need to start my career.\n\nWhenever students want to do it, the administrators and faculty say that it\u2019s highly discouraged, etc. And you\u2019ll miss out on the college experience.\n\nBut please consider how some people may want to graduate in three years and move on to the next phase of their lives. I get frustrated when a student is interested in advanced standing, and they\u2019re immediately discouraged by their peers, faculty, and administrators.",

I think I would have been fine; I made all my friends with the class year above me, took departmentals a year ahead, and really didn\u2019t have an experience contingent upon spending four years vs three (not a fan of class-year-focused events here). Pandemic makes judging the impact of four years on my life impossible to weigh. I still don\u2019t think I was wrong for wanting advanced standing. The benefit to doing four years was that I took a wealth of interesting 400-levels and got some helpful certificates for boosting job prospects.",

At Princeton every year they make it harder to do advanced standing, and at Harvard they recently scrapped it altogether.

Yeah, it\u2019s nice to earn money, but you\u2019ll soon learn that you can very easily earn more of it, but you can\u2019t get your youth back. If you\u2019re at Princeton and going to be as successful as you believe you\u2019ll be, one year of salary is a rounding error over the course of your life. Instead, you should consider listening to the older people who have wisdom (from having more experience than you). There\u2019s a reason virtually everyone says to enjoy that extra year of college life. If you\u2019re unhappy with your current college situation, then change it up. Take an easier course load and focus on classes you find fun (and take them pdf). Go study abroad. Spend a semester in Florence and a semester in Beijing. Try out some new clubs and meet the people you wish you had met freshman year. Go do something that you\u2019ll never have a chance to do again in your life because life, family, and kids come sooner and change more than you think.",

            "comment": "So, there's a couple of reasons this is discouraged.\n\nFirst, the pragmatic perspective from the university's point of view: the university-as-institution has a vested interest in building students' attachment to the school as a concept, an experience, and a memory -- building that emotional \"debt\" makes for more generous donors.\n\nSecond, the altruistic \"this is legitimately for your own good but we're going to talk about the 'college experience' because it's a more acceptable way of putting it\" perspective: the value of a Princeton education is only partially in the degree itself and the privilege/status rubber-stamp it brings; the real value to YOU is in the connections you make, both as an undergrad and through the Princeton network continuing on into your career. An extra year on campus is legitimately worth it in the long term in many cases even if you never set foot in a classroom and gentleman's-C your way through midterms and finals, if only because it means more time to make those connections, build a shared history, and entrench yourself as part of the network. What you get out of the classes themselves is a bonus, albeit one that can be very useful and enriching.\n\nIf you're looking at your time there as just for acquiring credentials showing you possess a baseline competency in your domain, you're going about it somewhat backwards; the value that $80000 of your parents' money buys is the opportunity to learn social and life skills in an incredibly low-stakes environment that also puts you in intimate connection with the world of the wealthy and privileged. \n\nSo yeah, advanced standing is just...legitimately a terrible idea for the majority of students. It's fine if you don't think it's for you, but you seem to be missing the perspective (or disregarding the possibility) that the people discouraging you by and large WANT you to succeed and believe that graduating early is shooting yourself in the foot, because for most people _it is_.",

    "postText": "Hello, I was a little bit confused about how AP Physics C Credit works for Princeton. I am attending next year and my school offers only AP Physics C Mechanics which I am taking this year but I do not know whether or not I get credit (if I get a 5) for taking only mechanics. Does anyone know what the class of 2026 policy is for AP Physics C?",

Unless you\u2019re trying to graduate early or are majoring in a physics-light STEM department (bio, chem, maybe ORF) it\u2019s not very helpful",

They are also only half-tests, in terms of question number and time length. So most colleges require high scores on both exams for credit. I assume Princeton will do the same.",

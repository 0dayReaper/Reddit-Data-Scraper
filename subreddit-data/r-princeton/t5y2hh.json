    "postText": "Unfortunately class of 2026. Of course all students got the TigerAlert about the guy who was caught in the library with his pants down (lewdness). I am just wondering why this was urgent news, cause the financial aid people seemed to think humiliation porn was allowed and even lauded on campus. Essentially my family has an income of &lt;$25,000 for family of 3 and this shitty school says \"Fuck you for ever calling in with this shit. Take out a loan for books + all other things you need you fucking idiot.\" So yeah, nice people. Even worse, they will apparently **give me financial literacy advice (through the low-income center) while forcing me to take out a loan**. So, obviously, everyone loves humiliation porn and irony at Princeton.\n\n Somehow even worse, it is my own personal hell that other peer schools give students with my income level a fucking negative allowance. So they fucking give students money to spend on stupid shit (like makeup or fucking NFTs even) and I am forced into slavery based on a lie that it would be affordable. My twisted life. The only reason this school has a high alumni donation rate is because everyone must slaver over humiliation porn. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt least now I know what I'll spend that shitty fist year allowance on -- some rope and a chair. Fuck. I already want to transfer from this rude bullshit.",

They treat callers like an inconvenience rather than a friend or colleague. Peer schools are not this manic and are actually coherent. They offered to teach me how to open a bank account like I am a fucking chimp and refused to pay for anything but the bare minimum. \n\nThe income of my family is &lt;$25,000 and my fucking state school is more affordable than this dump. I can't with this bullshit anymore -- everything is a red flag. I can't deal with an inane school that wants to spend millions building a low-income stupid center to teach me my ABCs and force a loan for fucking books while also claiming to be no-loan. Just give me money you fuck, I don't need a safe space or some other shit.\n\nI'm so glad I have not withdrawn my other apps. I would even join the army to escape this hell. I'm looking forward to a more mature, competent, and friendly school come April 1st.",

You can't brag about a record-level return on the endowment and have every conceivable standard of student life be awful.

I think that if you wanted to argue about princeton\u2019s money being wasteful, you\u2019d have to make better arguments. What funds would you cut, and what new money would you spend it on. Imagine the headlines - princeton spends 4 million a year on textbooks that students can download for free instead of AC in first college or any number of other things. \n\nThe endowment doesnt have unlimited money. If you think they can just tack on 50,000,000$ a year you\u2019re wrong, thats not how returns work. The people at princo and the board, experts in their fields, already calculate the max amount the endowment can spend while ensuring long term gains and growth. The endowment 40 years ago was almost negative, you know. Students didnt get much aid at all and it was only a rich kids school.",

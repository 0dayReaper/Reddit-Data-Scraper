    "postText": "If anyone happened to be around East Pyne Hall on Saturday 5/21 evening (at 8pm) and witnessed a guy (me) proposing to his then-girlfriend (it was an Indian proposal, if it helps), I'd sincerely appreciate any videos or pictures you'd be able to send me! Or even forward this to anyone you know who was there. I have some photos, but was so wrapped up in the moment that I didn't think to ask if anyone who was around happened to take a video.   \n\n\nI realize it's a long shot, but figured it wouldn't hurt to try. If you could spread the word that I'm looking, would also appreciate that! \n\n  \nBtw, it turned out great! My now-fianc\u00e9 &amp; I are ecstatic :)",

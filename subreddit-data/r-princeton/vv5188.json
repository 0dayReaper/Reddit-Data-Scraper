            "comment": "Mathey has a good community and usually pretty good food. They also have the biggest budget as far as I've heard, so we get more study breaks and events than some of the other res colleges. It's also located right by Nassau street and on the same elevation as the engineering buildings if you plan on doing bse. The main con is just the older facilities and lack of ac (which is very rough the first 2 weeks or so). There are also never ping pong balls by the table for some reason \ud83d\ude22",

Got top floor with insanely hot and dusty room. Had bad allergies for a day or two in the beginning from all the dust. After the first couple weeks you learn to tolerate the room and it doesn't seem that bad anymore. If you still find it bad, just do most of your studying somewhere else like Firestone library which is pretty close.",

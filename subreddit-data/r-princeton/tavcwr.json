It honestly changed my perspective on many things and encouraged me to take more philosophy courses.",

Peter Singer's class \"Practical Ethics\" was definitely a more engaging lecture, but I really appreciated PHI202's broad survey of the classic dilemmas and philosophers which I wasn't super familiar with. It can be super precept dependent, if you have a jackass in your precept or a shitty TA, your mileage may vary.",

Sometime this year, I plan on taking a masters degree in Epidemiology. Was wondering if anyone knew the statistical likelihood of Pacific Islanders getting into Princeton\u2019s Population Studies PhD program. It\u2019d also be nice if I could get real helpful tips on how to get in. The more specific the better.",

(If anyone wants to give me advice about making the choice please chime in!)\n\nI am leaning towards P though\u2014so take my advice with a grain of salt. Hopefully my experiences after just going through the process will be helpful. \n\nPrinceton\u2019s graduate degrees are all top notch. Your chances at any getting into any PhD are low, so getting into a top one is even lower. I think the acceptance rate is between 2-9% for most programs. However unlike undergrad, you\u2019ll be competing against qualified adults, whereas undergrads will be competing against qualified children. This means you\u2019ll need some real accomplishments, solid publication/career record, and good experiences. Your competition will be more intense, so you\u2019ll need to make sure you have a solid profile and plan going into the admissions cycle. Don\u2019t get dead-set on any program, there\u2019s a large degree luck in the admissions process at any top institution.",

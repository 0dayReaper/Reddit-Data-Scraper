The opener is a hilarious dude named Sharief Johnson and these shows should be a good time!\n\nTo see if you might like my comedy, here's a clip from my hour special: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pbbpgu-BZHU&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pbbpgu-BZHU&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nAnd if you like that and wanna come out, [Here](https://www.ticketweb.com/venue/hyatt-regency-princeton-princeton-nj/44754) is a link for tix.\n\nAlso Redditors get a discount! If you call 781-568-1471 and mention the post on Reddit you'll get $5 off tickets. Lol there's no promo code because the club owner is old school  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\nAnyway, I'm pumped for the shows. If you come out please say hi after.  Thanks all!",

    "postText": "I sent an official ACT score report to Princeton on October 20th, but it still hasn't been downloaded. I originally thought that they just needed self-reported scores but then I saw their standardized testing policy and saw they needed official score reports, so I sent one. Now I'm panicking - is it normal for it to not be processed yet? Should I call the admissions office?",

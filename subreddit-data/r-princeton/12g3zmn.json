    "postText": "Hey Everyone! \n\nJust committed and Princeton, and was a little curious on the social life on campus. I understand that in place of frats there are the eating clubs, but I\u2019m not exactly sure how these clubs function in the grand scheme socially. Are they the ones that typically host parties? Does anybody host parties? Basically, what do people like to do on the weekends? \n\nThanks",

    "postText": "Just for context, I'm going into senior year of high school and deciding where I want to apply ED and RD. My question really has 2 parts:\n\n1. Is Princeton culturally accepting of folks on the spectrum? One thing that stood out to me on the tour was the lack of Frats and rather eating clubs which seemed more inclusive and less of a social rat race. Most would probably consider my case to be pretty moderate meaning I can communicate well with those I know but I def have my quirks and certain social situations cause a lot of anxiety. Would I be able to get support through the school as needed? If the answer is no, that's ok but it's something I'd like to know before making decisions.\n2. Would it help or hurt to talk about it on my application? I feel like mentioning it would help the admissions officer have better context around the strengths and deficits of my application. On the flip side however, even though an admissions officer won't directly reject me cause I'm autistic, they want people who are going to be engaged in the school community and may write me off as someone who will be very insulated and not contribute to the larger community (and tbh, one of the deficits of my application is a relative lack of group clubs/activities/sports).",

Depending on the specifics of a situation you might get a lot of formal university support, or get more informal support from peers. \n\n2. If it's something that's impacted your high school experience in some way, it may be worth mentioning, but it may be perceived negatively if it's not directly connected to something else in your application. Using your supplements to show how you would want to engage in the university community/traits you have that would allow you to contribute in your own way could also help prevent assumptions from being made",

Now that you bring it up in that way, it kinda makes me think that the benefit to including it really depends upon how much knowledge the admissions officer has about it. One may sympathize with me and see I'm really trying to push myself out of my comfort zone in terms of group activities, even if said activities are nowhere near as impressive as most applicants. Others may just see it as some sort of excuse or won't understand that connection. I also feel like there's a positive aspect to it though since a lot of my interests around the area of math I attribute to being autistic. Ideally, my counselor (who I have a very good relationship with) would bring it up in her letter, explaining how it's affected me but also how I've dealt with the challenges from an outside perspective, which may give admissions officers a greater sense of confidence.",

Also while I've def had certain challenges I wouldn't just go into an application talking about depression or something in hopes of sympathy cause I agree that's a bad idea.\n\nIf 2 distinct college admissions officers read my application and their reason for rejecting me is purely because of autism, then frankly that's not the school I want to attend. I think that would also technically be illegal since autism is something one is born with; there's nothing I can do to get rid of it but I can change I how navigate the world aroung me with it.",

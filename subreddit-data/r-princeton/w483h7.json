There's a link to all of them here, [https://frs.princeton.edu/students/fall-2022-freshman-seminars](https://frs.princeton.edu/students/fall-2022-freshman-seminars), but I was wondering if there were any seminars I should DEFINITELY not take or if there were any exceptional ones too.",

That said, Ethics in finance is a recurring one, de Swaan was a partner with the blonde dude from the big short -- heard good things about it. Also take as many as possible to boost your GPA -- piece of advice I wish I took",

            "comment": "Hello and congratulations! The chemistry program here is beyond excellent. I'm a PhD student here (not chemistry though). I know many chemistry PhDs but you really have to ask them to know the full scoop on the department itself. But I can talk about grad life.\n\nThere are very few grad students at Princeton, which can make socializing a bit claustrophobic, but it also means that the school tends to care about us a lot more than larger ones. Expect lots of 1-on-1 time with professors and generally more resources and attention being put into you. There are of course some very busy superstar professors that are hard to meet with, but you are still going to be among their top priorities even if they are that famous.\n\nThere are lots of grad events happening constantly that will start flooding your inbox once you set up your Princeton email account. I'd estimate there's an event somewhere every other day. On top of this, departments have many colloquiums, happy hours, etc to fill any time you may still have. \n\nChemistry students work very hard, I'm not sure if this is on an advisor basis but the chemistry PhDs I know here spend more time working than any other program. However, Princeton's workload writ large is also much more manageable than other comparable schools, so it's not like they have no free time. I still see them at the D-bar (the private bar the grad students have under the GC), the gym, out rock climbing, and playing video games all the time.\n\nThey pay us very well here. And there are more resources available if you know where to look as well. If you're a computational scientist, ask your lab to buy you a laptop. If there's a conference somewhere related to your work, ask your department to fund a trip for you there. I asked my department for a departmental jacket on a whim and they designed, ordered, and gave out *Hundreds of Nice Coats* to everyone in the department. Princeton has a truly unfathomable amount of money, don't be afraid to ask after stuff.",

I think the attitude really depends on the lab (emphasis on reallyyy). Most of our labs are really chill and laidback, but others can be really stressful, so you can pick your vibe. But overall most find the atmosphere really friendly!",

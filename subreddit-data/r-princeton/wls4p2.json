    "postText": "Hello all! \n\nSo, I got into Princeton University's Class of 2026. Afterward, I gave my A Levels, and today my results came out. Very unexpectedly, I received a C in Economics. I am a student of Engineering and I received A\\* in Maths and Chem and an A in Physics. So my question is: will this affect my acceptance? I have appealed for a recheck, but still, I want to make sure this doesn't affect anything. By the way, my predicted grades were all A\\*s.",

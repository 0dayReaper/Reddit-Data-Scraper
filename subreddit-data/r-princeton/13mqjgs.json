            "comment": "This is a super broad question, and I\u2019ll warn you that what you put on the form does not necessarily end up being what you get. That being said, I\u2019ll try to give you my thoughts on it. \nI am currently in a double, and even though the room itself is pretty bad, the experience has been great. I love my roommate and we\u2019ve gotten really close, and we\u2019re generally pretty good at setting boundaries and being respectful of one another. That being said, the one downside of a freshman double is that you will not have a common room. That\u2019s unfortunate for me because my roommate and I have different sleep schedules, and I don\u2019t want to work in the room when she\u2019s asleep for fear of disturbing her. All this means is that I generally work at the library or in another workspace near my dorm; it\u2019s not a huge deal at all. \nQuads are also generally a good choice. As far as I know, you\u2019ll always have a common room, which is nice. Of course, double the people means double the mess and you have more relationships to maintain, which can be tricky. Honestly, though, it really depends on who you get as roommates.\nYou could also get a single, which is unlikely for most people as freshman. Personally, I\u2019d advise against a single\u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing to get one, but it is really nice to automatically have someone you know on campus, and chances are you won\u2019t get a single again\u2014 better to learn to live with someone early. That\u2019s just my personal preference though. \nOverall, it really doesn\u2019t matter what you put down on the form. All rooms are different and have their own benefits/drawbacks that can\u2019t entirely be predicted without knowing who you\u2019re rooming with. Don\u2019t stress about it!",

I had a double with a roommate who I love dearly, and we rarely had friction or problems and were very accommodating to one another. I know of other people who weren\u2019t quite so lucky; it was less a function of the number of roommates and more who the roommates were, though i might hazard a guess that a double is easier to manage socially than a quad because it\u2019s fewer relationships to manage. Then again, a double is somewhat all or nothing with the roommates. As for bathrooms, this depends on the res college. My dorm had shared bathrooms with the whole hallway; other quads and doubles had a bathroom. Tops there\u2019s one bathroom per room, but most res colleges have shared bathrooms between hallways. Hope this helps!",

    "postText": "Hi all, I am trying to decide between two schools. Princeton obviously and Pomona College. Since I am on the Princeton side of reddit I want opinions from this thread. Can anyone give me pros and cons for Princeton. I'm interested in the mind/ neuroscience. \nHow is the environment at Princeton? \nHow's the weather?\nIs it collaborative or very competitive?\n\nEDIT!!!\nI also want to go to medical school\n\nThanks",

Can\u2019t stress the financial aid piece enough\u2014it\u2019s far superior to that of virtually all schools.\n\nYou\u2019ll get a good education no matter what you choose, but I do think there\u2019s a little (lot? Yeah, lot haha) something extra you get with Princeton.",

            "comment": "Congratulations on having such an exciting decision. The good news, is you have only good choices. Hopefully, you'll be able to visit both schools, get a feel for the campus culture at both places, talk to the folks in the neuroscience department in both places. It's possible that once you visit these places, you'll get a very positive feeling about one place and not the other, in which case (assuming financial aid isn't an issue) you should pay very close attention to that. Beyond cultural fit, however, there are some metrics where Princeton is the clear winner: \n\n* **Prestige.** Don't get me wrong. Pomona is a great school. But only a handful of schools have the national and international cachet that Princeton does, and it opens doors. \n* **Network.** Princeton has one of the most engaged alumni populations. Like another poster noted, all living alumni are invited back to campus every year for Reunions, which strengthens engagement and provides opportunities to connect and reconnect with alumni each year. Alumni giving rates are consistently higher than those seen at other Ivies, further evidencing that the majority of alumni are grateful to the school and continue to be engaged with it. Being able to tap into the network is hugely valuable. \n* **Resources.** Princeton is an extremely rich school. Its endowment is more than 10x that of Pomona. Those resources translate into things like an amazing library, tons of funding for clubs and cultural activities (hello dirt cheap Broadway tickets), excellent financial aid, and funding for research projects. I traveled to Europe multiple times during my Princeton years, each time on the University's dime. The career services office was also extremely helpful when I was applying to professional schools, and based on conversations I've had with others, it's not clear that that's always the case at other schools. \n* **Proximity to New York and the Northeast Corridor.** It's really easy to get to NYC--take NJ Transit and it's a day trip. You can also take public transit to Philadelphia, though it's a little less straightforward than NYC.  The University will also arrange cultural trips to both cities. Princeton Junction (which is easy to get to with the \"Dinky,\" a short rail line that connects the campus with Princeton Junction) is also a stop on Amtrak's NE Corridor, so you can take the train from Princeton to Washington or Boston easily enough. \n* **Beautiful campus.** You'll see this when you visit, but Princeton has an extraordinarily beautiful campus. This probably shouldn't be the deciding factor, but it is nice to walk around a place that looks like Hogwarts.",

            "comment": "Princeton alumna just home from Reunions here.....so I am way biased, but I don't think Pomona has anything like the post-graduate networking/fun that Princeton offers.  I go back to Princeton Reunions nearly every year because I have family in the area I can stay with, because I love Princeton and going to all of the events, concerts, and programs on offer that weekend, and because I really enjoy marching in P-rade, hanging out at my old eating club, seeing old friends and making new ones.  Last weekend,  I met a lot of interesting alumni I had never met before and reconnected with friends from the Class of 1988, some of whom I had not seen since 2018.  (One of them had flown in from India to attend...)  Maybe Pomona throws great reunions, too, but you can't beat Princeton's for fun, fireworks (great show in the stadium on Saturday night!), and lots of schmoozing with people who in many cases are leaders in their fields.   Educationally, it looks like Pomona provides great opportunities, but I don't think Pomona can match Princeton in terms of nationwide reputation and its network of (dedicated, rabidly loyal) alumni.  (And I am bet they don't have a cheer that's as good as a locomotive!)",

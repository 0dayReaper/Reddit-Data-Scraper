    "postText": "Hey all, I'm moving up from the south for graduate school in the fall and I was wondering about what type of car I should get for Princeton and NJ, generally.  I've been told by a few friends who have lived up North before that I need a four wheel/all wheel drive car because of the snow (I've never driven in snow!!) but was wondering what you all think, and whether it is necessary or not! Also if you all have any other cars recs for driving up North and in colder weather :) Thanks!",

Depending on where you're housing, you may just want to bike to work--I lived on/near campus and only used a car to go food shopping but other grad students with families lived in west Windsor which is cheap and they needed cars.",

NJ townships in most areas reliable plow snow and our winters are relatively mild. Get whatever you want.",

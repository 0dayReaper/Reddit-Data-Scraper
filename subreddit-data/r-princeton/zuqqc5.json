For most people it makes most sense to be honest on their application about intended major, since their essays and extracurriculars and coursework probably reflect that, and it\u2019s easier to be sincere than to lie. The only time it could maybe make sense would be if all your extracurriculars and coursework were oriented toward a tiny major (think Slavic studies) that you were also somewhat interested in, and even then, I imagine admissions officers are suspicious.",

    "postText": "Hi! I am prospective student and was just wondering how hard is the econ major at Princeton? I have heard that Princeton is so hard academically, that it is super hard to get As, and there is so much work/psets as a whole. Is that true? Is it very hard to maintain a 3.7+ GPA as an econ major and still have free time? Thank you so much! :)",

You can most definitely scoot by with 4.0 GPA and loads of free time - I calculated that an upper level econ major would only take classes three days a week and be in class for about 12 hours. That's ridiculous, considering only one or two of the classes have to be strictly econ.",

    "postText": "Hello Princeton community!\n\nI am an incoming intern for the summer of 2022. I will be doing some work at the GFDL, and I can't wait to immerse myself in the Princeton community. First, some logistics: \n\n\\- I will be staying from June 13th - August 6th.\n\n\\- I will have a vehicle on campus\n\n\\- Will be staying in the \"Joline\" dorms\n\n\\- Will be on some kind of meal plan \n\n\\- Will have a good amount of free time on the weekends!\n\nI just wanted to consult with you all to see if I could get any \"insider\" information about Princeton. What are some things that I should totally do before I move out in August? Any tips for the best places to study? Are there any events on the weekend that I should keep my eye out for? In short, what should an 8-week summer intern know about Princeton University? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

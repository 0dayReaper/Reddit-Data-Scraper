Granted, I did not have any complicated medical issues, but, for example, I once had the stomach flu. They checked me into a bed and gave me IV fluids. It\u2019s a small thing, but makes a tremendous difference in recovery and I had never had a regular doctor do that for me. I once sprained my ACL and a sports medicine doctor on staff treated me fantastically. Scans. Brace. The works. You didn\u2019t specify your gender, but if you are female, those services really knocked it out of the park for me. It was amazing to have a GYN who really understood the specific medical needs of a 20 yo college student. \n\nHonestly, I thought the healthcare was outstanding.",

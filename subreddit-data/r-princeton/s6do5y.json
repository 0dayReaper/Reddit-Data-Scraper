    "postText": "I am planning on getting a BSE computer science degree. But I am interested in numerous certificate programs as well (5 to be exact). I was wondering if there was a cap on how many certificate programs you can take (considering, at least to my information, each certificate program takes 5-8 courses) at Princeton? Ideally, I'd like to be able to do all the certificate programs because I'd love to be able to take as many of these interesting courses at this wonderful university as possible.",

            "comment": "Lesson of the life is the certificates are meaningless after the second one. This is especially true from Princeton. People do need \"free\" time to actually think. An over burdening course load is not a good thing. You should focus on a meaningful set of coursework to develop a toolbox that makes you stand out.",

I do disagree with some of the other comments, though\u2014I got two of my certificates by accident, so if that's true for your certificates, go for it! If you're only taking courses because you want another certificate, that's less useful. Take whatever you want and only then look at which certificates you're getting.",

No one has ever asked me about them or cared that I had them, but it was nice to see that the system recognized that I had taken a varied set of courses over four years.",

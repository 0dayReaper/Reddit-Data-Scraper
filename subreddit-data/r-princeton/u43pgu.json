    "postText": "Hello, I know this is a long shot but maybe it will work out. I am currently doing my Master of Science in Management Engineering (at politecnico di Milano) and I am about to start my thesis about hedge funds performance before and after the great financial crisis of 2008. I was looking for some databases about hedge funds performances, but apparently they are almost impossible to get access to, since they are like 5k to 10k per year. Princeton university provides to students the access to the Lipper TASS database, which would be very useful for my thesis. If any of you would like to help an Italian folk, that would be great. Thanks in advance for your suggestions or help.",

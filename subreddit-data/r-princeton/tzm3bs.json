I would say that intro classes (large CS classes) are a beast and the professors teaching them are generally there because they really like teaching. They aren\u2019t going to put a shitty, disinterested lecturer in front of 400 students, all of whom are experiencing the department for the first time. \n\nOnce you get to the more advanced, upper class courses, it can be more hit or miss. There are some courses that are pretty *much* required, and are advanced for undergraduates and pretty basic for tenured professors. So those might be phoned in a bit. *But*, if you manage to get all the way to graduate seminars, that\u2019s when professors are tracking things that they really love, and should be a great experience.",

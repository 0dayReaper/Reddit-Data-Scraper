    "postText": "Hi all, friendly neighborhood mod here. I'm a current grad student and the newest member of the /r/princeton mod team. As you may have noticed if you're on New Reddit on desktop, we now have a couple sidebar widgets for sub rules and related subs. \n\nWe now have [user flair](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205242695-How-do-I-get-user-flair-)! We have post flair! I encourage people to take advantage of both - user flair lets others see at a glance if you're an undergrad, grad student, parent, alum, etc; post flair lets people filter the subreddit for posts by subject (since we all know Reddit's inbuilt search sucks).\n\nWith all that said, I'm also pinning this thread to ask for suggestions for ways to improve the sub. Would people like stickied megathreads for certain topics/events? (e.g. course selection, move-in, Ivy Day, graduation.) Are there additional post flair categories people would want to see? Currently the options are: Future Tiger, Housing, Academic/Career, Shitpost, and Town of Princeton.\n\nDo people have suggestions for rules? Thus far there is 1 sub-specific rule: be respectful. The other Ivy subs have additional rules around admissions-related questions: either banning them entirely and redirecting posters to /r/ApplyingtoCollege, or quarantining them to a weekly megathread. Is that something people would want here?\n\nIn closing: report spam and rules violations when you see them, and let me know what you'd like to see from the sub going forward!",

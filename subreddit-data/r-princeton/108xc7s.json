    "postText": "hi everyone I would like to apply as a transfer student for the fall 2024 term and would like to know if I repeat 2classes for a better mark, how would that affect my application and how would they calculate my GPA? would Princeton only look at my first attempt, take the average of the two or base it off my university\u2019s system of repeated courses and calculate the GPA that way. thank u so much for ur assistance!",

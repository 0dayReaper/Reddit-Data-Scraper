    "postText": "How many students use bikes/skateboards/scooters to get around campus? I'll be an engineering student so I suspect I'll have to get to the equad often which is in the corner of campus. Would it be worth the investment to get an electric scooter over a manual bike based on the terrrain of campus?",

It\u2019s actually a very nice walk, so I liked walking tbh.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is still true, but bikes got stolen regularly. So that\u2019s another thought\n\nI recommend just trying it out for a few weeks. Unless you absolutely need to save 20 min a day, you may really like walking!",

I even have a friend who never locks his bike and has never gotten it stolen.\n\nYou could also hide an AirTag on the bike so you can track it.",

            "comment": "Walking definitely is nice when the weather is nice. However, personally, when I got a bike I cut my travel time across campus by at least 60%. I feel you definitely save a lot of time when you bike and everything is literally within a 5 minute (usually less) bike/scooter ride. If you're walking from Forbes to equad that will take around 20 minutes.\n\nIn terms of if you want a bike or scooter that's more up to personal preference. The entire campus is on a slight hill, so going from Whitman to Mathey (or equad) will be almost all uphill and can be tiring when biking. However, I like biking because I see it as exercise and you eventually get used to the hill if you do it often.",

It works just like any other major for undergrad \u2014 your independent work junior and senior year is slightly different (more policy focused than theoretical, especially junior year), but nothing special otherwise. \n\n \nSPIA is great overall - not crazy difficult compared to other majors - pretty on par. It\u2019s a lot of what you make it! \n\nNot sure on journalism \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f no experience there!",

Journalism is a certificate (minor) I think, not a major, and it\u2019s a lot of work (usually you have to write a piece each week, depending on the class), but not graded too harshly.",

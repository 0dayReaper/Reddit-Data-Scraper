I\u2019ve seen there\u2019s an Archeology one but it seems to be more focused on, well, archeology. If not, could I take History of Art classes as a STEM major?",

But it really depends on the major. MOL for example has a LOT of coursework, so those + your guts (or general requirements or whatever they're called now) will take up a lot of the \\~32-35-ish courses you'll take over 4 years (depending on AB or BSE).",

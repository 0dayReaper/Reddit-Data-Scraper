    "postText": "Hey, everyone. I know this question has kind of been asked before but I'd like to confirm this before moving ahead in case any of you have an answer or solution.\n\nA few days ago, I submitted my application and sent my SAT scores through College Board. It took two days for the score to be sent, so on College Board, it says that my scores were sent on the 27th of December. However, on my applicant portal, it says that the official scores have not been received yet. I realize that it may take a few more days for them to process it but the application deadline is in two days and I assume that includes all supporting documents and grades. Should I attempt to email admissions even though they might not respond or should I just wait it out?\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this and I appreciate any advice you can offer.",

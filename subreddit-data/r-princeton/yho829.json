That a university student only takes courses in one department is not exceedingly weird (to use the description by /u/cheese1234cheese) in much of the rest of the world, where you declare your major before arriving and largely take courses just in that subject. But it isn't how the undergraduate system works in the US.  At all US colleges and universities you take courses in lots of different departments to satisfy graduation requirements.",

    "postText": "I just got accepted to Princeton as a transfer today! (Yay) \n\nAre there any transfer students here that I could message about the credit evaluation? I have nearly 60 credits at a California community college, but I received my preliminary credit evaluation and they\u2019re only accepting 3 courses. Can I appeal it and get it reevaluated? Thanks in advance guys!",

Princeton in general is always open to a discussion but I wouldn\u2019t be that surprised if they don\u2019t accept more credits \u2014 they can be sticklers in general on stuff like this.\n\nWelcome to the family! \ud83d\udc05\ud83d\udc05",

    "postText": "I eat breakfast at either First or Whitman on my way to my lab every morning around 8. I prefer the food at Whitman *except* when there is warm strawberry topping at First, in which case I prefer it. Unfortunately the online menus don't tell me which specific topping First has (blueberry and apple are not worth forsaking Whitman's grill). If you know anyone who consistently eats at First before 8am, please DM me and I'll give them my contact info. Thanks.",

They tend to be super nice and im sure at least one wouldn\u2019t mind helping you with your morning topping conundrum as long as you\u2019re not weird about it.",

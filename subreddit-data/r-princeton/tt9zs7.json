I don\u2019t know what year you are but eventually I figured out how to make it work and my last two years the things that would have filled me with torturous fear were straightforward problems to solve. Though i definitely had lapses back to the bad stuff in junior and senior year. Difference was I had more confidence I could figure it out. But it sucks being in that place. I remember one time calling home as a sophomore and telling my mom how hard it was and her response was, \u201cmaybe you\u2019re not cut out for Princeton.\u201d Wasn\u2019t what I was looking for at the time but it definitely made me want to prove her wrong. Be well, take care of yourself (including finding time for yourself), and good luck",

Take it from a fellow human who has been in the darkness you describe. You cannot see the door, but it is there. Take it on faith that the door is there and let others help you find it. Drag yourself to see a University counselor and tell them what you\u2019re experiencing. Let them guide you from there. There is a way out, I promise. https://uhs.princeton.edu/counseling-psychological-services",

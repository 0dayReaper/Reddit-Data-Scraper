I looked through the requirements and only diff I see is AB is less rigorous, more independent stuff towards the end, and less science requirements. Just wasn't sure if that was what AB CS is intended for, or if I gave that interdisciplinary rational in my app the ao would think I didn't do my research.",

            "comment": "I don't think \"less rigorous\" is really right; the BSE degree is more science-y with its extra physics/chemistry/math requirements, but the AB degree has more research requirements, which is just as rigorous in my opinion.\n\nThat aside, you can take a wide variety of classes as either CS major. I was BSE COS, and I took extra COS classes alongside 9 history classes, 8 biology classes, 4 literature classes, etc. Plenty of COS majors take econ, though it wasn't my thing.\n\nTo actually answer your question, Princeton encourages you to take classes outside your major, and COS gives you more leeway than any other major I looked at. If you say you want to major in COS, it should be because you're interested in COS, but saying you're interested in Princeton because you can major in COS (your passion) while still taking EAS, SOC, etc. (other interests) is appropriate.",

You can also switch between the two without too much hassle (but you need to do the requirements, of course).\n\nEven in BSE, you have to take courses outside of the major. So I wouldn't be concerned about that, you'll have plenty of opportunity for it.",

            "comment": "AB isn\u2019t less rigorous - it just has different requirements, namely foreign language/distribution requirements and a thesis instead of some basic science requirements. Many of the BSE COS people I know chose it because they\u2019re too lazy to do a full thesis. Regardless, I don\u2019t recommend referring to choosing anything because it\u2019s \u201cless rigorous\u201d - that\u2019d make you look lazy.\n\nAnyway, you could be pretty interdisciplinary as BSE COS too, as there are still some distribution requirements, so it\u2019s not like that\u2019s a unique feature of being AB. It is a good reason to choose a liberal artsy university like Princeton in general, though.",

Kid just destroyed one of the most important open problems in my field. Together we improved his initial idea, wrote a paper, and presented it to about 10,000 people hanging on the edge of their seats at the biggest graphics research venue in the world. \n\nThis kind of cross disciplinary study needs to happen more.",

I\u2019ve never found getting interviews difficult either since many companies just interview lots of people, especially from a school like Princeton. Just network a touch for referrals down the line, maybe do an internship or two (or don\u2019t! I didn\u2019t have one in software!) and prepare lots for interviews.",

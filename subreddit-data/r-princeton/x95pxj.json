    "postText": "Next academic year (after finshing my master's in the EU) I might have the opportunity to work in a lab at Princeton for around 9 months. I'm very excited, but also wondering now what student/social life would be like for me as an international visiting research student.   \nCould I easily join things even though I would only be there for a year? Are postgraduate students involved in Princeton clubs/societies? How hard is it to get to know people and get involved when I will not be taking classes?   \nAny advice would be appreciated!",

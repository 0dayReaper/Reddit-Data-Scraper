Im a little scared Brown will be too far for me and I will be homesick, plus Pton\u2019s BSU and other cultural clubs are awesome. Anyway, I\u2019m just wondering some Pros and Cons and if you have any advice! I would love to hear about what it has been like off of campus, how far you are at home, and you\u2019re overall experiences. Thank you!:)",

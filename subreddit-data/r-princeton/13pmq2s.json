    "postText": "We\u2019re considering moving to the area, and seeking advice. Right now I\u2019m wondering what the commute is like for people who do it regularly for work. I know the express trains are technically under 1 hour, but keen for more info on what it\u2019s really like. How full is it? Are there regular delays? Etc. thank you so much!",

If you\u2019re in Midtown, the Financial District, or anywhere along the west side it isn\u2019t too bad of a daily commute. \n\nIt\u2019s 55 mins on the express (a little over an hour on the local). What\u2019s nice is that the Northeast Corridor comes frequently, even at off peak hours, and always terminates at NY Penn. We also usually get the double deckers. A lot of the other lines terminate at Hoboken or require a change just to get to NYC.\n\nI used to do it daily, and from my experience 80% of the time it was totally fine, 15% it had minor but not crazy delays, 5% would be brutal delays. Feel like that can be said of any rail service though.",

Going into NYC is not a problem, but trains are packed on the way back during rush hour, and a good possibility you may not get a seat for the first 15 min of the trip.",

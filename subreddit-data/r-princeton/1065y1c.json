                    "comment": "Overall, just on straight odds, I\u2019d predict the random student would pass the random class. Clearly a first year student\u2019s odds would be much lower than a senior\u2019s and a STEM student would have an edge over a non-STEM student overall, just on straight odds. And there are probably slightly more non-STEM students than STEM students overall. But there are also probably fewer pure STEM classes overall as well, so that might balance out in terms of the odds. Pretty much everyone would be screwed drawing a class taught in a language they don\u2019t understand, but the odds of that are *relatively* low. So overall I\u2019m putting the straight odds of the random student passing the random class at greater than 50% but not THAT much more. Maybe 60-65%? If the random student turns out not to be a first year I\u2019d bump that up to 75%. If it turns out to be a non-first year STEM student maybe it\u2019s as high as 80%? Hard to imagine anyone being able to pass more than 80% of the classes in the undergrad catalog given how many are taught in foreign languages or have lots of technical prerequisites.",

Any high-level humanities class that's taught in English could reasonably be passed by anyone (I may be unaware of some obvious exceptions here?) Obviously a random student has a very low chance of passing Texts from Arabic Prison Literature or Algebraic Topology, but these classes are in the minority in the catalog (maybe 25%?). OP you're right that it's basically only foreign language-based classes and high-level STEM that you're screwed in, but even within those (especially non-math STEM) there's some wiggle room. \n\nI suspect that a hybrid-field stem student who did advanced math, such as a bio+physics or math+chem upperclassman, could pass 90% of the courses in the catalog.",

    "postText": "I am a first year student who is worried they might fail their first semester. \n\nI am not particularly hell-bent on getting all As, but I am currently failing two classes and am on the verge of failing another. I am pretty sure I have undiagnosed ADHD/executive function disorder, and I am going currently untreated for GAD. I seem to start assignments and cannot continue studying for more than 10 minutes at a time, after that I begin actively seeking distractions (napping, online browsing, cooking, chores etc). Additionally, I struggle to remember quantitative material, which makes my STEM courses particularly difficult to understand as most derivations are initially too difficult for me to understand. I think I would be able to focus or pass my classes if I maybe had one or two classes with no precepts or labs. \n\nWhat i've currently been doing to minimize my burnout has not been working. I stay in regular contact with my DSL, but I do not interact in any with my RCA or PAA as I genuinely do not enjoy my previous interactions with them or my advisory groups. I have been looking for a therapist to for my GAD for the past 8 weeks and I do not have my first appointment with them until after midterms. I am increasing the amount of times I go to office hours, but I notice for some of my classes that I do not have questions for my professors during office hours because they went over the material I am lost on over a week ago. I currently have a McGraw tutor in one of the classes I am not failing, but the limited amount of time does not allow me to learn the material in the way I need to actually retain it. I find it difficult to study regularly throughout the week, either I will spend 7+ hours of pomodoro method studying or I will do nothing all day. \n\nHas anyone else struggled this much with online learning, and is their anything I can do to  get my grades under control now? This current way of studying is unsustainable, and I am not of privilege to be able to take a gap year or defer in the future. I love what I am studying and I love my support system, I am simply unable to do online school at the present moment and would love to take a break or get it together so I don't feel like i'm drowning.",

            "comment": "Please talk to your DSL and Dean about a possible midterm extension. You seem to have genuine reason to get one. My best friend got an extension her freshman spring for mental health issues and they didn\u2019t make her take the exams until finals week, so she had lots of time to catch up.\n\nIf possible, I would also try to fit in a quick intake appointment with CPS so that they could perhaps back up your claims about mental illness. \n\nWishing you the best! First semester at Princeton is especially tough and I can\u2019t imagine what a big adjustment it must be to do it virtually. Best of luck and please feel free to reach out for any reason.",

The university has been better than anticipated (in my personal experience) in these situations especially when you are upfront.\n\nI am sure they will be understanding given the challenges presented by the pandemic and remote learning.\n\nAlso: Try to cut yourself some slack, one semester is just that. One Semester. These grades exist only until the end of the course, so whatever happens do what you can to manage this and let the rest go. I think you need to be honest about what you can and can't handle and then try to set yourself up for success. If that's dropping a class, that might be worth talking about. I dropped a class first semester because I was swamped and got my feet under me, and the rest worked out.",

Try Hello Hypnosis Austin with Devon and listen to her recording before sleeping. Do any kind of Cardio exercise\u2014like walking up steep hills for an hour. Helps clear mind of noise. \nTry Inderal-10-20 mg dose. It\u2019s a cardiac med to reduce bp, hr but has worked well with anxiety to take the edge off-need Rx.\nThis after going to psychiatrist. Physical exertion of any kind really helps.",

I just got diagnosed this summer with ADHD, anxiety and depression and wish I had done something sooner- awesome job:). It is hard when you are so successful in highschool to realize you are working way harder to compensate or just smart enough to never have to study. College definitely has different type of tests, assignments, teaching styles and a completely different structure, so this DOES NOT mean Princeton is not where you belong or that you cannot be an amazingly successful you:) you definitely can be. This means you are very intelligent and have overcome many obstacles to get to the same place as your peers. I am sorry you're going through this right now. \n\nI go to Tufts so my experience is different and I am not familiar with your campus academic/ mental health services but this is what I have done. I would recommend reaching out to your accessibility services. They can put you in contact with a counselor immediately and you can talk through exactly what you are going through or feel you need, you can say as much or as little as possible. I would tell them how you've been feeling and how this is affecting you/ classes. Ask for them to find you a therapist and psychiatrist that take your insurance. Please reach out if you want to discuss anything else!",

            "comment": "Yes to everything people have already said.  Also, be sure to ask your Dean and DSL about taking some classes PDF.  It'll be important to verify if it is ok with the department you might major in, if it is a prerequisite.  Using the pdf option liberally this semester might really help lift some of the stress.\n\nDo also really think about what you want to major in.  Think about departments that fit your skills and interests.  Please don't feel pressured into majoring in something that doesn't suit you or inspire you.  Majoring in something because you think you should (due to internal or external pressures) can lead to extra stress.\n\nFinally, I know you have probably heard this a million times, but a couple 10-20 minute meditations each day might help you de-stress and focus.  There are some excellent guided ones out there.  The Calm app is good, for example, although a little pricey.  \n\nOne last last thing:  the Yale course on Happiness is free online through Coursera.  It might be available as a podcast as well.  Many find it very helpful.  You probably don't have time for it now, but maybe you will during winter break.",

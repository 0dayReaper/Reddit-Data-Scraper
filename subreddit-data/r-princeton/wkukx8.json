            "comment": "I mirror the other comments. My $.02 as a senior/hard sciences major is that most of your stress will be self-imposed, and some of it will come from classes. \n\nI've had a few classes here where the workload is objectively too much to handle if you're taking three or four other classes. I've taken five classes most semesters so that was OK (IE, skip meals and substitute Soylent), but I can imagine those being difficult spots for most students. However, I think that with diligent (immaculate Google Calendar, realistic expectation of time needed to do things, good digital hygiene, etc.) time management, 90% of the students here can achieve a B+/A- average in STEM (or an A/A+ average in the humanities lol). \n\nThe real source of stress I've had to come to terms with is my goals and my expectations of myself. The classwork is hard and the curves for any class are harder - you're competing against all the top students from the nation's top high schools. There is rarely any curve to rely on. You won't be the smartest kid in the room ever again. You might sometimes realize you're actually one of the least talented people in the room. You see the flawless, effortless perfection every student projects and compare it to your own intimate knowledge of your own personal difficulties and begin to wonder if this place is really for you. You had a self-concept coming to Princeton, and now that's beginning to fall apart. You find yourself awake at 4AM, staring at the ceiling, unsure about how you'll be able to face the coming days, months, years here. And it's only your first semester. \n\nBut then you pull through. You develop a more mature and more nuanced self-concept. You can honestly assess your strengths and weaknesses as an individual, and you realize all the late nights poring over a tricky assignment or trying to shore up some concept you can't quite understand have secretly been building skills you didn't have before. You begin to fully develop your passion(s) that will extend beyond your four years in college. Suddenly, it's your senior year and you're applying to grad school or med school or starting an internship or a career, and you realize that whatever academic difficulty Princeton holds pales in comparison to the difficult journey of self-discovery you'll be forced to start here, and that that holds true for any college anywhere in the country.",

Some Princeton students make Princeton hard for themselves by trying to take on too much.  \n\nBoth are more rigorous (in STEM at least) than the state schools I'm familiar with.",

    "postText": "hi!\n\ni recently was admitted to princeton as a member of the class of 2026 :) princeton is my dream school, and i am so so stoked to attend. \n\nhowever, it seems as though the office has deemed my circumstances ineligible for need-based financial aid. i come from a middle class family whose income barely exceeds the cut-off. paying the full 80k is just about narrowly manageable for my parents, but they would really be squeezed out, especially because my sister is 4 years younger than me (i graduate college just as she enters it, so there's no overlap aka no extra aid). i'm really worried about the financial burden that my parents will have to carry because of me.\n\ni was wondering if there was a way to ask for a re-evaluation? have any current students here experienced this, and what next steps did they take? is it possible to appeal as a not-yet-enrolled student / would calling the finaid office help? or anything else that i could do that could help?\n\nfor context, i have already submitted an affirmative reply to the offer of admission that was extended.\n\nsorry for taking up your time and thank you!",

            "comment": "Princetons financial office is definitely more open then most to having a conversation \u2014 if there are costs that you haven\u2019t yet shared (I.e., some costs that wouldn\u2019t show up in your FAFSA if there\u2019s like childcare costs that are paid in cash) that is definitely helpful. That being said if you parents can pay (i.e., loan free) even if it\u2019s tight, I think that\u2019ll be a tough sell.\n\nPrinceton was great and worked with me and my parents but even then, both my parents and I had to take out substantial loans from Princeton. Definitely I think they\u2019d chat pre-acceptance because they want to help! College costs are definitely crazy!!!!",

Like the other person mentioned ur chances are much much higher if u share extra costs that popped up, or something new to change the calculator",

Whatever sounds compelling is probably good.\n\nAlternatively try applying to scholarships right now, if u look well im sure u can get 10k and if you\u2019re not getting financial aid then just use the scholarships to pay.",

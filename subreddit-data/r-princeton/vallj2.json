I Need advice on whether to purchase a meal plan or not. \n\nMore specifically I wanted to know about\n\n* Quality\n* Overall value considering it costs about 14$ per meal\n* Other alternatives and how they compare against the meal plan\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "I thought the food was great, and if you look at menus and cycle between dining halls, you can get pretty good variety, too. If you befriend some undergrads, it can be convenient, since undergrads often get dinner with each other in dining halls. (All undergrads have at least two meals per week in dining halls.)\n\nOverall value is less good. It's an unlimited meal, so if you eat large meals, it may be worth it. I opted out after my sophomore year. I believe \"resident graduate students\" get free meal plans, and based on what my RGS did, it isn't much work. Not sure how competitive that is.\n\nYou can go independent, which is just cooking for yourself. I believe some coops accept graduate students, but you'd have to check; that would be much cheaper per semester, but you'd regularly have to go to their kitchen to cook. I'm not sure how much of the free food is back, but pre-covid, you could easily survive on free food if you knew how to find it.",

I only knew a few grad students decently well, and that was typically because they came to undergrad events that were open to grad students. There's no need to mingle but nothing stopping you if you want to.",

If so, I recommend purchasing some kind of plan - the food is decent (and there are normally decent options), and it\u2019s very convenient, plus you can make friends at meals. There\u2019s nothing super walkable by the grad college otherwise. If you\u2019re living elsewhere, it\u2019s not as worthwhile. If you know how and have a kitchen, you can just cook. Nassau street and Frist grill meals are similar in price but are generally higher quality, but are not walkable from grad college. I know a couple of grad students who joined eating clubs, but that isn\u2019t so common.\n\nI\u2019m an undergrad, so the calculus was a little different for me, but that\u2019s my perspective.",

You don't have a kitchen in your room, it's too far away from restaurants, and the socialization is great.\n\nDo not buy a meal plan that includes lunch, because on any typical day, you'll likely to either 1) get food from a restaurant, b) bring something to eat in your department's common area, or c) best option, scrounge free food from some department event.\n\nIf you live in an apartment, I wouldn't buy any meal plan.",

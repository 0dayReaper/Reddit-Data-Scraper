    "postText": "Princeton has been my dream school since the 8th grade. My parents went there, and I've romanticized the idea of being a student there for as long as I can remember. I'm generally a pretty strong student -- 3.95 GPA, 3 AP courses as of sophomore year (that will increase)., with a 5 on the AP Spanish exam as a freshman. I haven't taken the SAT or any standardized testing or anything like that. I'm not very into sports, which I've heard can be detrimental to my chances of getting in, but I'm currently co-president of a club that focuses on facilitating discussion and consensus for highly debatable issues and a Spanish editor for a multi-lingual magazine (I hope to become editor-in-chief by senior year). Also, I've moved a lot throughout my life (I'm on my 5th country), which could serve as an interesting essay topic.\n\nThe thing is, I don't have a direct \"hook\". And I really, really want to get in. Any suggestions for how I can improve my chances?",

Admissions is semi-random beyond a certain point, and there are so many good places that fixating on one just isn't a good idea. Cast a wide net and most likely your luck with even out somewhere solid, and then just be happy and make the most of it.",

Being a captain or something is good for leadership experience but by no means necessary. I got in with the most athletic participation being choir lol. As to how to get in, with holistic admissions, there is no one formula for getting in. If your school has class rank, try to be in the top decile. Take advanced classes that match up with your major, not just random ones to boost the number of AP\u2019s youre in. Be involved in extracurriculars you\u2019re passionate abt and will really dig in deep for. Many ivy admits have a passion project if you\u2019d look into it. In the end, it comes down to whether or not you fit at the school. Write compelling, authentic essays. AO\u2019s know when you\u2019re inflating things/being dishonest. Make sure your counselor and teachers can write compelling letters of rec. Do some competitions to win awards if you can \u2014 again, best if you\u2019re passionate about them. \n\nId also try to not have your heart set on one school. It\u2019s so hard to get into schools like Princeton even if you do everything \u201cright.\u201d Make sure to apply to some safeties, many targets, and a few reaches like princeton",

            "comment": "Our son got accepted into Princeton and we are very happy.  There is no rhyme or reason why some schools rejected him and why some schools accepted him.  There are also schools with a wait list.  \n\nOur son took a lot of AP classes, skipped two years of math, had extracurricular activities, took the SAT, and got in.  He also has some really good awards that few others got.  We also know of two or three other people who got in but I don't know how they also got in or what they did to earn getting in.\n\n\"**Princeton University admissions is most selective with an acceptance rate of 4%. Half the applicants admitted to Princeton University have an SAT score between 1460 and 1570 or an ACT score of 33 and 35. However, one quarter of admitted applicants achieved scores above these ranges and one quarter scored below these ranges.** \"-US News &amp; World Report.\n\nNote the part where it says, \"...one quarter of admitted applicants achieved scores above these ranges and one quarter scored below these ranges\".\n\nThey are number one so they can be selective if they want.  You may be competing against the best.  By all means try to get in.  See if you can get a personal interview so that you can make a connection.  The problem I think, and don't go by what I think, but how many kids competing against each other have high SAT scores, have awards, been in the school musicals, have achievements., etc.?  In some ways all colleges have to sort through students that all look alike on paper and decide who gets in and who doesn't.  They have to decide who is a good fit and who may not be.  It could be your place in line for some schools during the decision-making process.  I want to stress is we have no way of knowing how they get in.\n\nWhat is important to a person who decides who gets in and who doesn't get in?  What we think is important may or may not be what is important to them.  I'm not privy to their process.",

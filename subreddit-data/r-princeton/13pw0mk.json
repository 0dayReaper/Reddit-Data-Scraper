    "postText": "Tl;dr: where should I live as a postdoc if I don't want to be too isolated but can't afford Princeton rent?\n\nI'm an incoming social science/humanities postdoc (30F) trying to figure out my living situation. I'll be moving from out of state by myself (no pets/kids). My partner will likely be joining me for long chunks of time in the summer or whenever he is not teaching. I am pretty open about where I live--I've lived all over the US in rural/urban/suburban settings, and all have their appeal to me. However, I won't know a lot of people, so I don't want to wind up somewhere that makes it hard to make friends/socialize. My other priorities are having a full kitchen to cook and enough extra space for a nice WFH setup, not having roommates, and not spending more that $2200 at the very most (under $2000 would be much better). I'm wondering if other postdocs/staff/advanced graduate students could shed some light on the places people typically like to live, and any places I might really want to avoid. Obviously, this is a very personal decision, I'm just hoping to get the on-the-ground perspective. I've been scoping out options for a couple weeks now, so I think I have a basic understanding of the geography, prices, transit options, etc (but maybe I'm getting things wrong!)\n\nRight now I'm considering some small towns about a 20-25 minute drive from Princeton (Cranbury, Heightstown, etc). These seem to have great rental prices for lots of space, often in cute historic buildings. And I don't mind having a slower pace of life, fewer dining options, etc. But they don't seem to have a public transit option to campus (that is, if I have a few beers I'm going to need to uber home). It would also be slightly less easy to hop on the train and go to Philly or NYC when I want. Would I be dooming myself to lonely isolation if I live in one of these places?\n\nAlternatively, I've thought about living in Philly or even Trenton. But I worry that in Philly I'd feel isolated from the campus community and would struggle to make friends. I'd also like to apply for staff housing, but I haven't gotten my login credentials yet (not getting a response to my email requesting temporary credentials, either) and I need a July or August move in, so I'm not holding my breath that this will work out. \n\nThanks for making it through this treatise (I think I'm channeling my end-of-disseration anxiety here!).  I'd so appreciate any thoughts!",

Both professors are great at picking apart why some lines of thought work and others don\u2019t. Whether you have strongly held beliefs already or don\u2019t, both professors do a great job making sure you\u2019re holding your beliefs for good reasons. I found their methods really useful going forward as I needed to develop opinions on new political or ethical issues around me. Eric Gregory\u2019s class is particularly useful, even if you aren\u2019t particularly religious- he spends a lot of time going over secular counterarguments too, and plenty of the \u201cChristian\u201d arguments he presents have enough nuance that they don\u2019t need to be propped up through faith first.",

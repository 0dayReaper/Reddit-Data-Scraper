    "postText": "Good afternoon,\nFirst post on Reddit in a while but wanted some explanation or experiences of Princeton. \n1st things first, I got into Princeton on a full ride and am the most excited person of all time.\nOne thing is that I feel like I\u2019m unprepared for the coarse work at Princeton. \nI am a low income student from Texas who\u2019s class rank is 2 out of 500 and I got a 1400 on the sat. I also am in a few clubs but I\u2019m passionate about science fair and swimming. \nI worried that when attending Princeton that I will be left behind in the dust by every one since my school isn\u2019t particularly good for academics and that my sat score isn\u2019t too good. What would y\u2019all recommend I do over the summer too prepare. As well to this was it a shock when y\u2019all went to Princeton academically and socially? Can\u2019t wait to be a tiger. Still think it\u2019s a dream saying that. Lol",

Many students benefit from this, and it is also a great way to meet new college friends!  Then, as students get used to college level work, less support is needed.\n\nI would look for any pre-course coursework which could even be posted before the first day of class.\n\nUse the guidance counselor or any support services offered by Princeton.",

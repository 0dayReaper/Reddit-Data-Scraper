    "postText": "Hi, I have an internship in nyc and am deciding whether to take corporate housing or commute from home. I live a little over an hour away. Would it be a bad idea to take the stipend and commute? A lot of people have been telling me I'll miss out on the intern experience but I doubt I'll be making any friends. I havent made any friends in college so I don't think the magical intern experience applies to me. I'll obviously still try to make friends but I don't want to take intern housing and then be stuck in my room in complete isolation every day like college.",

Last train out of new york is 1:22 am.\n\nThe rest of what you said, but giving importance to saving 2 hours commuting implies I have a better use of my time instead of those 2 hours, which I really don't. I have no life. \n\nAnd I lived in NJ my whole life, Ive tralled NYC a bunch. yeah, doing it on my own and living there is definitely different, I'm not doubting that. But it will be cool for a couple days, and after that the novelty will wear off. What then?",

There are some things that just won't happen if you need to catch a 6:50 train every night.  Let yourself enjoy that a little, and if nothing else you'll be prepared to make a more informed decision next time around.",

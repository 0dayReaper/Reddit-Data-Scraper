            "comment": "It\u2019s been a long time since I took the French one so it may have changed, but basically, it\u2019s a collection of questions that test your comprehension of grammar and vocabulary (imagine it\u2019s like the SAT but in French), with each question having a varying level of difficulty. It really is one of these things where you either know it or you don\u2019t. Like, you could refresh your knowledge on some obscure conjugations or run through some vocabulary cards, but \u201cknowing French\u201d is just too broad to really study for.",

            "comment": "It's a placement test. There's no point in studying for it because you'll just make your life more difficult if you get incorrectly placed into the wrong French/Italian class. I took the French one, and it is like 60 or so questions. It is all multiple choice, and you'll be given questions where you must choose the correct word in the context of a sentence. I believe there were also some comprehension questions after reading a paragraph or two.\n\nOverall, though, don't study and just take it with what knowledge you have.",

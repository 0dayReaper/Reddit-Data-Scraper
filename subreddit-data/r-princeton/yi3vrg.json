    "postText": "Applying early to Princeton this year. I was wondering if it is appropriate to send a criticism of a literary text (such as a novel or poem) or a sociological analysis of an arthouse movie written for an English class as the assignment for Princeton. Good luck to everyone applying and anyone currently in Princeton. Thank you for your answers!",

            "comment": "There are a lot of international grad students (40% of the grad school or so, much higher than undergrad). The application process is the same as for US residents, just with an added TOEFL or equivalent. \n\nActual admission is based on field of study and varies a lot between them, it's best to reach out to students in labs you want to work at to ask about their background and admissions process for graduate applications.",

Certes, il y\u2019aura des \u00e9pines (le moins possible on esp\u00e8re) tout au long du chemin mais on vous encourage dans vos d\u00e9marches. Si je peux me permettre une suggestion, les lettres de recommandation (d\u00e9taill\u00e9es) sont extr\u00eamement importantes. Avoir des lettres \u00e9crites par vos professeurs ou promoteurs qui chantent vos louanges donne au comit\u00e9 une meilleure id\u00e9e de vos aptitudes, votre travail, votre potentiel tout en prenant compte des exigences du d\u00e9partement ici \u00e0 Princeton. Bon courage !",

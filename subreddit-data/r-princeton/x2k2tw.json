            "comment": "Pros: the most beautiful campus I\u2019ve ever seen, everything is within walking distance but there are also buses, lots of nature and places to study outside, the town of princeton is a cute suburbia with great restaurants (although many can be a bit pricey), train right on campus makes it easy to get to airport, NYC, Philly, very safe, late night Wawa right on campus is life changing\n\nCons: construction at the moment is in the center of campus which is annoying and disrupts its natural beauty, people don\u2019t really go to bars just eating clubs (which is a pro in my opinion because it\u2019s super unique and you don\u2019t have to spend money, if you want to go to a bar you can go to NYC or Ivy Inn/A&amp;B/Triumph), limited parking so hard to have a car on campus (you generally won\u2019t need one imo), winter can get cold and dorms without AC can be really humid in the first few weeks",

Nice location, easy train access to NYC and EWR (although it takes like an hour, which might be too long for your taste). College town, plenty of walkable restaurants, but suburban and some complain it\u2019s expensive. Some dorm buildings are very old and have no AC, which is unpleasant. Lots of construction happening rn.",

Not much to do immediately outside of campus besides restaurants\n* Right now construction is awful (but that's true for pretty much any campus)\n* Relatively expensive restaurants outside of campus\n* No chain restaurants besides wawa\n* Average dining hall food depending on the day and hall",

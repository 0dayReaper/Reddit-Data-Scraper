As a freshman, I lived in a quad in Blair Hall East, which at that time was known as The Monastery because it was the only remaining all-male dorm in the university.  The bathroom was horrific, but I believe it has improved since I was there.  As a sophomore, I lived in a single in Witherspoon, which was nice.",

Not as pretty as, say, rocky or mathey but definitely a good college to actually live in. Studio 34 in the basement is amazing for late night snacks and study breaks",

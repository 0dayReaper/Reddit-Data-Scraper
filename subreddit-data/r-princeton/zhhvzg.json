I also think a lot of the identity-related affinity groups like Asian American Students Association, Black Students Union, etc. have mental-health efforts or groups. \n\nSorry not super specific, but I figured a half-assed response would be better than none at all. If you're a current student, the above areas would be places to look into, and if you're a potential student, just know that the above groups def have stuff going on, whether you're looking for more advocacy or support oriented stuff",

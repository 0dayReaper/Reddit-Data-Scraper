    "postText": "I am kind of unfamiliar with the course offerings at Princeton. I am planning to take a physics major. Along with STEM related courses, would I be able to choose some humanities-related courses? If yes is there any restriction on what courses that you can choose. How does the whole liberal arts thing work in Princeton? (I am an international student)",

As an AB student you\u2019ll be required to take some humanities courses, and you\u2019ll have a small amount of wiggle room (maybe 1-2 courses per year) to take whatever you want (I.e. the specific course requirements probably won\u2019t add up to the overall required course total).",

            "comment": "There is nothing special about Princeton in your question: it is a feature of basically *all* universities in the USA.  Picking a major is not something you have to do as part of your application (it often can be declared by the end of the 2nd year) and as part of the undergraduate program you have to take some courses across a wide range of a fields (\"well-rounded education\").  \n\nPrinceton calls these \"General Education requirements\" and the different areas for these courses are listed on https://ua.princeton.edu/contents/general-education-requirements.  You can find similar lists at other university websites under the same label or maybe \"breadth requirement\". MIT calls theirs \"General Institute requirements\".",

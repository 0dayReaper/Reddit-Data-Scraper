We'll need to wait for the toxicology and investigations to conclude before drawing any conclusions, but I'm not so sure that is an example of a mental health issue at this time. \n\nNot to retype the whole thing here, but I commented on a thread about this on the /r/newjersey sub-reddit:\n\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/y97o1c/comment/it8p2ee/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3",

However, I believe it would only upload information to the location services if somebody (like her brother, for instance) checked the app to track the person. There is a possibility that the phone is constantly logging its tracking information locally on the device, and it could be extracted if the family knew her password to unlock the device. Aside from that, her family would only know where the device was from the times they explicitly requested to track it in the \"Find My Friends\" app.",

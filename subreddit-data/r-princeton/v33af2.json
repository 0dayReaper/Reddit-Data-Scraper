There\u2019s a free weekend shopper bus that goes to Target and some other shopping areas.\n\nTbh you don\u2019t need too many winter clothes - buy one waterproof cold weather jacket for when it\u2019s legitimately cold and snowy and buy one light water-resistant jacket, and then otherwise you should be fine in sweaters/sweatshirts/hoodies (layer if necessary). You shouldn\u2019t go out of your way to buy sweatshirts/hoodies/sweaters - bring a couple you already have from home, and then you\u2019ll get several for free in your time at Princeton from your class/res college. And honestly, even that might be too much - my freshman year it snowed like once, and was only below freezing for like 3 days, which my Floridian body was able to handle.",

    "postText": "Hi! I was admitted to the Class of 2027 and I am currently choosing between Princeton and Yale. I really love everything about Princeton (the people, the campus, the area, the traditions, etc) but I heard that the grading, classes, and the junior and senior thesis can be very academically rigorous compared to other top schools. I was just wondering if most Princetonians really have fun, thriving social lives, and are really happy overall. I get that consensus with yale but haven't gotten to speak to many people at Princeton. I would really appreciate any input from current students. Thank you so much! :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, Idk how much this matters but I would be either an econ/finance/math/ORFE major.",

            "comment": "Current first-year here, and honestly Princeton is what you make of it - just like anywhere else. Academics are very tough, but the fun begins in the rewarding feeling of finishing a hard class, and after 4:30 each day the wealth of extracurriculars and clubs is really super enriching. Also, you will learn here that a course is not bad or uninteresting just because it is hard. The most interesting stuff can be the most difficult, and it really is all worth it when you look back and know you got through it and grew as a result. Also, everyone here wants you to do well, and they will help you to earn your own success. My (maybe inaccurate) impression of Yale is that A\u2019s are passed around like candy, so they really don\u2019t mean as much, nor do they care if you aren\u2019t actually learning. I wish you the best of luck on your decision, but I do think Princeton is fun and the rigorous academics don\u2019t diminish that.",

            "comment": "Social life: going out (predominantly to eating clubs) can definitely be fun but gets redundant imo. Some of the more fun experiences I\u2019ve had while at Princeton were class trips to NYC, generally hanging out with people, and participating in extracurriculars (club sports, hanging out at eating clubs) after class. \n\nClass wise: Well, I\u2019m pretty sure we have the lowest average GPA out of all the ivies lol if that says anything. I do think some of the grade deflation practices still somewhat exist but in smaller ways - I\u2019ve had a few profs limit the amount of As in a class or set a very high cutoff for As which left the vast majority of students with worse grades than their quality of work reflected. I\u2019ve heard horror stories about the average grades on Chem exams being in the 30%s lol. Basically, our classes are very rigorous, but inter-student competition, at least in my experience, isn\u2019t much of a thing. Also, grading can vary wildly in humanities classes based on something as simple as who your preceptor is. Generally speaking, exams are pretty difficult but it\u2019s almost like a common struggle on campus during exam periods and, while not fun, it is bonding and you\u2019re definitely not alone in being stressed during midterms/reading period/finals weeks.\n\nI would say both students at Princeton and other similarly elite schools have to balance their workloads and social life. That said, I was talking to my friend and he said that his brother at Yale had a much nicer and academically easier undergraduate experience than my friend had at Princeton lol. As someone taking much fewer classes this semester, thus having a tiny workload, I wouldn\u2019t say Princeton is more fun, but it is less stressful.",

I didn't know how fun eating clubs could be in terms of the social scene. Thank you also for sharing that the struggle of the academics is not isolating but rather a bonding experience since everyone goes through it. Thank you again and this was so helpful as I make my decision :)",

Of course, Princeton has its merits in other ways, so in the end it's your choice.",

Also NYC is closer to Princeton (about 80 minutes on the train versus 140 to Yale). Also Princeton is easier to fly out of than Yale (45 minutes on the train to Newark from Princeton. Yalies usually have to take a 3-hour shuttle van to JFK if they want to fly anywhere).",

Many of the eating clubs are quite inclusive \u2014 there\u2019s just a few that still retain the old stigmas and sense of exclusivity. And sure, you can fly out of Bradley, but the options are limited and the shuttle van still a hassle. You can also fly out of New Haven because that startup Breeze has a bunch of flights from there now. At least Newark has nonstops to around the globe. Anyway as I mentioned, both are great places, people deciding between the two should visit and much as they can and talk to as many people as they can to determine which one is the best fit for them personally.",

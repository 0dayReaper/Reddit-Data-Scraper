They told me to touch base with them next week after I had time to think about their mentor ship style (not that that ,matters for this question) \n\nBut I know this varies between schools - any insight on how much influence a professor has on admissions?",

            "comment": "Depends on the program. Princeton really restricts the number of incoming graduate students, especially in certain programs, to the point where a PI wanting you in might not guarantee entrance.\n\nIt usually does though. Perhaps the largest thing incoming PhD students are evaluated on is research fit, and a PI wanting you to work with them is the highest commendation to your research fit you can get. Also the fact you were even able to get a meeting means you likely have good connections, which Princeton also values highly.",

            "comment": "The way these decisions are made vary by department. Don\u2019t take my words too seriously, but in my small-ish dept, there are a few PIs that make up the core admission board. It\u2019s not my impression that all PIs know how these things are decided exactly, though I would imagine that if the board happens to include your PI, or if your PI is able to make their preference known, that would help things a bit. \n\nThough honestly, you could try to circumnavigate that topic with said potential advisor. Something like, could you tell me a bit more about how decisions are made etc. You figure out a way to phrase that. Can\u2019t hurt.",

    "postText": "Hello! I will be starting grad school at Princeton this fall, and am really looking forward to it :)\n\nHowever, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed/stressed by housing - I will be moving with my partner, and we are looking for a 1 bedroom. I am not married to my partner or in a formal \"domestic partnership\" - does anyone have insight into how this might affect my ability to get placed into Lakeside or Lawrence apartments? \n\nThank you so much for any help!",

University housing is cheaper, has free busses that go to all over the campus and shopping places, has a small gym (Lakeside), has nice common areas for social events and etc.",

I guess depends what you\u2019re looking for, but I felt like campus was already so much of a bubble I wanted to go back home to somewhere off campus at the end of the day. There\u2019s some great places to live that are actually closer to campus (walking) than lakeside/lawerence so I\u2019d definitely at least consider it.",

If you have a car then you could look further away at apartment complexes such as Canal Pointe, The Mews, Princeton Meadows etc. If you have a large budget to splurge then there are some luxury apartment complexes such as Avalon and Woodmont Way etc. All of the apartments would be within 15 minutes driving to campus. Although in general off campus may be marginally more expensive (if luxury apartment then massively more expensive) that\u2019s not universally true, like I live off campus in a room in a nice house walking distance from campus for cheaper than an equivalent at lakeside. Plus I get amenities like having a yard / porch and the school not being able to kick me out after my housing guarantee runs out. Been able to live in the same spot for 4 years now which is great because I hate moving. \n\nOff campus housing website (need PUID to log in): https://offcampushousing.princeton.edu",

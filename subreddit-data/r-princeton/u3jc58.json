    "postText": "I want to help my son deciding between SAMS from Carnegie Mellon and NJ Governor\u2019s School. He was accepted to both. SAMS will be 4 weeks in person and Gov science at Drew two weeks virtual one in person. Here in NJ gov school is considered prestigious but of course CMU is nothing to frown about. Any thoughts? Content wise he likes both. His dream school is Princeton.",

My son is not very interested in the medical field. Is there an opportunity to focus in other areas at the Gov school? Congratulations on Princeton!",

Like, if he\u2019s passionate about art, are there art nonprofits he can get involved in or start at his school, etc. The rest is details.",

Princeton can get quite rigorous at time, and coupled with all of the accomplishments and things other people are doing, it can be stressful at times (especially when our university president basically said this environment is a somewhat good thing). There's resources on campus to help with this, as does creating a strong group of friends, but it is definitely something everyone faces.\n\n2) Small town. I don't mind it too much, but I know quite a few people that would've prefered at least a more active / larger town than what Princeton offers. You make of it what you can, though.\n\n3) Construction. Oh my, there is so much of it, and it can get annoying.",

That may not bother you, but the student I know still is put off by that although they conceed that the campus is getting more economically diverse as the years go by.    \n\n\\#2 - There is some bafflingly incompetency in administrative tasks with things like course selection, staff getting back to students in timely ways, the weirdness of the room draw, etc. Maybe this is reflective of the current state of society these days, but it just adds to student stress\n\n\\#3 - Academic pressure is real for many.\n\nHonorable mention: the construction around campus right now is full-on and an eyesore as well as a drag on current student life",

I had friends who had cars our senior year, which was obviously great, but the parking is super inconvenient. Having a car is just not the norm and campus life is designed in a way that assumes as much. That's fine, but it is definitely a very different experience to what many of my friends had at other colleges.",

Campus life would be much different  if it was in NYC like Columbia. My point is that admin could let more students park on campus and use their cars to leave Princeton without going to NYC or Philadelphia. A lot of students complain about being in the Orange Bubble when on campus because everything is so dominated by Princeton and it feels like it\u2019s the most important thing in the world when it isn\u2019t since you\u2019re only seeing Princeton students, profs, workers, and townspeople (hence me saying it\u2019s insular). \n\nClassism is certainly related to income and probably race, too. Eating clubs and the bicker process (thus impacting social life) often subconsciously base things off of race and income and that does result in a certain level of classism and elitism. Obviously this happens at other elite academic institutions where wealthy students and legacies go and isn\u2019t exclusive to Princeton.",

On my admitted students weekend at MIT and UChicago I got the vibe that the people there thought very highly of themselves and pretty lowly of others. They seemed less welcoming and a bit more classist, ironically. It was interesting because from general stereotypes about schools, I didn\u2019t expect that. \n\nMany of them were from the same socioeconomic environment, and engaged in classism without even knowing it. \n\nAt Princeton I actually noticed less of that, atleast in the department I was visiting.\n\nThat difference in \u201cvibe\u201d is actually one of the factors that led to me choosing Princeton as the school I would attend next fall.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m not a current student, I\u2019ve just committed\u2014and the undergrad experience will probably vary from the PhD experience\u2014so if anyone wants to chime in that would be great.",

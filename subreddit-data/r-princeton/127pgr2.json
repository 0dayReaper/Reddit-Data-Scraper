Now, as I received and accepted the waitlist offer, I am looking for ways I can increase my chances of getting in from the waitlist pool. I heard that there is 15% for waitlist applicants to get admitted. Do you have any suggestions of what I should I do now in addition to writing a solid LOCI?",

            "comment": "According to the Common Data Set for 2021-22, Princeton admitted 150 of the 1000 students who accepted their spot on the waitlist. So your 15% number is solid. That\u2019s probably around 5x the odds of getting accepted, so that\u2019s good news for sure. While it\u2019s impossible to know what it will take to get off the waitlist (it probably depends on factors totally outside your control, such as who accepts and doesn\u2019t of those they accepted) a good LOCI surely can\u2019t hurt. If you got waitlisted at Princeton it means you had an ass kicking application and no doubt you\u2019ll have many acceptances to many other excellent colleges. Just keep your fingers crossed but don\u2019t sweat it too much. You have already done everything that is in your control. It\u2019s up to the Fates at this point.",

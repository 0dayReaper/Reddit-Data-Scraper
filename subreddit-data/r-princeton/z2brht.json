You don\u2019t declare major until the end of freshman year for BSE and end of sophomore year for AB, so up until that point there\u2019s no such thing as switching majors. Switching between AB and BSE requires some forms, but very easy freshman year, and doable sophomore year. If you\u2019re switching to BSE you need to get the engineering prereqs done, and if switching to AB you need to get distribution requirements done (in particular, language). If you\u2019re switching to junior year you also have to worry about getting your JP(s) done, since the requirements could be very different for your new major.",

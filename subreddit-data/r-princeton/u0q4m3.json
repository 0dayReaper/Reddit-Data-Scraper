All data was derived from Princeton's common data sets.\r  \n\r  \nHonestly, I didn't expect the data to be so consistent ever since 2018. The range for math scores over all 8 years is almost only 10%, and for EBRW over 5 years, it's less then 5%. Even after the test optional policy was adopted in 2021, the percent of scores above 700 barely changed. This could mean a lot of things.",

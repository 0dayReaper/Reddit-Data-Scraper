Princeton's classes are graded more mercifully and have lower workload, more like Stanford or Harvard (though both are easier, I would say, than Princeton).\n\nAs someone who went to a very difficult undergrad, I will say that there are some upsides. I find graduate school very manageable (and my friends who went to med school say the same) because of the level of rigor I'm used to. I also had an easier time standing out in undergraduate because difficult curriculum stratifies students very effectively. However, I didn't really enjoy my undergrad experience since I basically had to spend all my time working...so I'd still advise for an easier school if given the option.",

The math department at Princeton is not teaching Fourier analysis, differential geometry, or algebraic topology in some different way because the university also has humanities majors.\n\n\nFor the OP: I don't know what your background is, but math is one of those subjects that at the university level is extremely different from what you think it's about in high school (unless you have an opportunity to study it at a more advanced level sooner).  There are people who go to college wanting to be a math major -- not just at Princeton, Caltech, Harvard, or Stanford, of course -- and once they see what the scope and style of math is in college decide to pursue something else.  If that happens to you, then Princeton provides many more alternative degree options than Caltech.",

Princeton math courses may have more take-home finals due to the reading period than at some other places, but this is not what I had in mind when I was referring to what is being taught in the courses.\n\nSomeone who takes Fourier analysis at any high-level (pure) math department is going to learn pretty comparable things at different places (Parseval's theorem, Fourier inversion, Cesaro convergence, some L^(2)-theory).  Maybe some applications would vary, but the core of introductory Fourier analysis for math majors is pretty settled material by now.",

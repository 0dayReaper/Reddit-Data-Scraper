    "postText": "Hi Princeton\u2014 I\u2019m a Johns Hopkins student and a member of several clubs relating to sexual violence prevention. Recently there was a drugging incident at our university that inspired a huge campus protest that attracted local news. Students have been trying to force the Hopkins administration to implement a university-wide program that will prevent sexual violence at primarily Greek-held events\u2014 perhaps by having sober monitors drug test drinks on students\u2019 behalf, or by having drinks distributed by a third party. But we aren't certain on any details yet, so we're open to ideas.\n\nThere\u2019s been quite a bit of pushback from the university and so I\u2019m really interested in connecting with your university\u2019s sexual violence prevention club/team, as well as determining what y\u2019all do to monitor or prevent druggings and alcohol-adjacent sexual violence. Like, do y\u2019all offer free drink tests or toxicology screenings? What kind of accountability structures are in place to prevent sexual violence happening at large parties?\n\nPlease feel free to DM me. I\u2019d love to work with you and prevent sexual violence at Hopkins. Thanks.",

They're @princeton_pha on Instagram if you'd like to try contacting them!\n\nWe also have an Alcohol Initiative Board that sponsors non-alcoholic events on weekends to encourage social alternatives that doesn't involve drinking.",

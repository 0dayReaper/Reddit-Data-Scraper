    "postText": "Hi, I'm currently preparing my Princeton application, I'd love to know if the school offers a major in particular (other than CS! Not because I dislike coding, but because of competition) that would be particularly suitable for a career in quant finance (and the tech industry as a backup, SWE or managerial positions). I'd like a STEM undergrad, am planning to go to grad school, am good at math. ECs/student profile are also STEM oriented. I'm an international applicant.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nP.S. Any CS + X or interdisciplinary majors?",

If you're doing any of the technical majors, go into it telling yourself that becoming a fluent coder in one of the big 3 (Java, Python, C) is non-negotiable. At that point software engineering as a profession is always a fallback because, well, employers really need people who know which side of the compiler points north.\n\nI really do believe that the COS126/217/333 sequence should be added to the basic gened requirements for all STEM majors.",

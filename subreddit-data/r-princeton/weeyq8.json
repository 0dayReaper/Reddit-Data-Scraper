If you get an iPad you can get Good Notes for like $8 or there\u2019s a bunch of free apps like One Note that work just as well. As someone who started off with a pencil and notebooks in the beginning, and iPad is so much more convenient, efficient, and neat for note taking and general studying\n\nMost people have iPads on campus",

                            "comment": "\u201cMost people have iPads\u201d is a bit of an overstatement, but I generally agree that they are common to see in lecture and make note taking/reviewing super easy and efficient (especially for math classes, drawing graphs, etc). Can be a huge time/paper saver for classes where the professor posts lecture slides bc you can just take notes directly on the pdf. Some professors have \u201cno technology\u201d policies, but this is not super common in my experience and one such professor I had made an exception for note-taking tablets.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I made it through four years of Princeton econ/math classes with a notebook and pencil (and for humanities classes just using OneNote on my laptop) just fine, so definitely no need for an iPad if it\u2019s a financial burden. But, I did envy my friends with iPads especially around midterms/finals when I was squinting to see what I wrote in a smushed notebook that was filled to the brim.",

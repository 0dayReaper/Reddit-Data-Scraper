            "comment": "It's a meme that every other state hates NJ above any other state except their direct rival. There's some truth to the fact that NJites are boisterous and proud of being from NJ and it can be abrasive, but a lot of the hate comes from people who have never actually experienced it beyond the trivial non-representative ways:\n\n* well-off people from NYC and Philadelphia are too busy staring up their own buttholes to ever leave their precious vibrant urban cores, so their entire concept of NJ is \"oh, those trashy poor downtrodden satellite cities near our unassailable metropolis\", ignoring the rest of the state.\n* relatedly, people who couldn't imagine not living in major megalopolises berate NJ for having few or no \"actual\" cities; but people who come from rural areas experience NJ as too crowded because it's the most densely populated state.\n* many on the rest of the east coast think only of the couple of big highways that act as a key thoroughfare through the mid atlantic region to the northeast, but ignore that the vast majority of the state is not the industrial sprawl that has built up around those highways. (There's an old George Carlin joke \"NJ calls itself the Garden State. What are they growing, fucking smokestacks?\" that is a perfect example of this misconception that NJ has no greenspace despite being one of the states with the highest percentage of its land dedicated to state and national parks.)\n* many recall a trashy TV show \"The Jersey Shore\" and treat that as though all NJ people are excessively tanned, shallow idiots. But this ignores that just about all the people on that show were from Staten Island, not NJ.\n* people associate it with stereotypical early-to-mid 20th century Italian American culture and treat the state as though its culture were some sort of a motion picture mafia monolith, despite that it has one of the largest percentages of immigrants from around the world, not just Sicily\n* people hate the \"Joizey accent\" that like 5% of NJ people, tops, have.",

            "comment": "Like any state/area, there are good parts &amp; not so good parts - measured on any standard you choose, culture, crime, cost of living, wealth/poverty, etc.  - the \"worst\" aspects as perceived by outsiders (usually adjacent states) commonly develop into stereotypes perpetuated in by jokes, etc. as part of a rivalry culture. not much different than members of a residential college bonding over their rivalry with another residential college over jokes &amp; stereotypes. But no state is just one thing - not just the stereotypes or the jokes. The New Jersey of Princeton and the New Jersey of the Jersey Shore are two different New Jersey's, for example (see, I just perpetuated a stereotype if you have an image your head of what the Jersey Shore is like).",

            "comment": "As an international student I heard about the hate especially since I looked at Penn first. Seems like Penn people just love to hate on Princeton.\n\nParts of NJ are not nice, but Princeton and the local area are lovely. \n\nPart of the stereotype comes from: \n\nThe Jersey Shore (show and location)\n\nThe NJ Turnpike (there\u2019s a joke that everyone lives just off the Turnpike, but in a way yes. Not very funny since the state is rather narrow and tall. Plus this highway is extremely efficient and people from outside of NY and NJ just don\u2019t seem to understand the traffic patterns which leads to more scorn)\n\nNewark Airport. The area around the airport isn\u2019t very nice. Maybe people see the shipping areas and poverty and extend this to the rest of the state? This is a bit of a reach, but maybe? \n\nThe larger cities. Some of them are known for crime and so even though you would be fine (going to catch a train in Trenton for example), people just use them as an excuse to say the whole state is dirty, rude, or full of trash.",

But the state overall is not especially pretty, and there is a segment of the population that has a unique Italian-American subculture. (Watch a few episodes of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d to see a fictionalized depiction of this subculture.) That said, the town of Princeton is widely known as being an oasis of charm in New Jersey. For a college location, it is almost unparalleled in safety, beauty, architectural assets, and walkability.",

There\u2019s also the Jersey Shore, which, depending on which beach you\u2019re at, ranges from what you imagine the shore to be like from the show to family friendly environments. It is true that some of the industustrialized areas aren\u2019t the prettiest, but there are so many forests and lakes. If you have a car it is very easy to go on a hike. Every town/city has different dominant cultures. It is true that some cities have strong Italian-American cultures, but there are many different cultural groups across the state. Overall, the state is very diverse. You\u2019ll start to learn more about the vibe of your surrounding towns the longer you\u2019re there. Don\u2019t let the jokes stop you from coming to school here. Some of the jokes are true though, the driving is awful and the taxes are high.",

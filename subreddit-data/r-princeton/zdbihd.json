Low-income students get free tuition, housing, food, and travel stipends to go home for dinner and winter, and starting next year a $4,050/year stipend.",

This amount does not need to be paid to the University but is listed as a recommendation so that students can get external scholarships or save money for expected annual spending for personal needs, books, and other essentials.\n\nPrinceton recently beefed up their financial aid so far more people now will pay no tuition, and it also eliminates the student contribution and replaces it with a stipend expanded to $4,050/yr. Regardless of how much you pay to attend, you'll get this stipend for books, essentials, personal spending, technology, entertainment, going out, whatever. It's like a UBI almost. It will go directly to your account to transfer to your bank.",

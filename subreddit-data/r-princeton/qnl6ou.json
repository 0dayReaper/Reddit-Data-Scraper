Tried going back one more time after a one-year hiatus to get the list of what exactly was in it but alas I found the whole salad bar gone. Other than the leafy base we chose off of the shelf, I think the Southwestern had avocado, tortilla chip strips, grape tomatoes, queso fresco, and came with a creamy avocado dressing. Am I missing anything? I feel like there were black beans probably?",

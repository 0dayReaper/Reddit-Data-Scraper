            "comment": "My answer is mostly from the POV of someone who is doing a PhD so it will be research focused. \n\nAdvantages: amazing science, diverse research topics and I quite liked that there are a lot of younger female faculty; if biophysics is your thing, you will have access to a state-of-the-art instrument core and the best type of cryoEM microscope. I think the many experimental design questions prepared me very well for my PhD. Princeton has great instruments in both quality of the recording and variety of functions.\n\nDisadvantages: too many pre-meds, so it can become toxic when you are taking hard classes and the As are limited; quite a bit of memorization; depending on what research you are interested in, it might not be ideal for you if you want to do more translational studies. MOL is very strong at basic research. Workload is high (mostly in terms of the breadth of information learned) but it mostly comes from pre-reqs, Cell Biology and Genetics. My pet peeve is the limited grad school application guidance/info sessions before I applied to PhD programs.\n\nAs for the senior thesis, personally the most stressful thing was the defense, but it really depends on who is on your \u201ccommittee\u201d. My members were tough\u2026",

I liked all the departmentals except for core lab but I have not heard of any department with a good core lab. freshman through junior fall is an absolute grind especially if you don\u2019t come in testing out of pre-reqs, but you\u2019ll get rewarded with cool lab experience, relatively easy requirement fulfillment, and a chiller thesis experience. feel free to dm if you have any more questions :)",

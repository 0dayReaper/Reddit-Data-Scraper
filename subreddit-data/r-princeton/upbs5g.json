Something that I brought was an electric kettle which I pretty much used daily for coffee, tea, and making soups and comes in handy when the dining hall is closed. You might find a lot of this stuff at the \u201cResale\u201d Princeton does in the beginning of the year but it gets real hectic. I personally ordered some of this stuff off of Amazon, which you can always do if you need things. :)",

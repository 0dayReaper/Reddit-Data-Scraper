It also does an outstanding job at easing the transition from hs to college and introducing you to all the resources Princeton offers plus giving you some friends and mentors to make moving here easier. I really loved it! \nI will say it IS challenging and time consuming but so rewarding!",

You get a bunch of free credits before school starts and a level of of one on one attention from tutors and professors that is unusual even for a school as undergraduate-focused as Princeton. \n\nIt's also worth noting that I'm still in touch with many of those incoming frosh from the summers of 2005 and 2006, and have repeatedly assisted many of them in their job searches as they navigated industry and moved into increasingly senior roles \n\nDo it.",

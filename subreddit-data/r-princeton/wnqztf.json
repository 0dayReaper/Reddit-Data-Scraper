There\u2019s a group of people who are working professionals in Princeton who meet up like once a month or so and have potlucks/picnics/etc, there\u2019s also a huge trivia group they have on Tuesdays too. I realize I\u2019m just an internet stranger, but I could potentially put you in touch with them.\n\nOtherwise, I\u2019ve met a fair number of people at the big community table at Small World Coffee too or by joining running groups. There\u2019s also a big bulletin board in Small World where people put up posters and pamphlets for events around town too, so checking that out could help!",

It\u2019s a very undergrad focused place (on top of a very family-age town to begin with), so just know this is entirely natural and keep your head up! I don\u2019t know much about the community outside the university, but it seems like a town with residents who get involved with a number of local initiatives/groups and who are eager to meet others, so I bet there are outings you could join. Also, I know someone already mentioned this but I think a decent amount of people use dating apps in the area if you\u2019re looking for something like that",

I had been in an a cappella group and two different theater groups, but they felt cliquey and exclusive... so I ended up dropping out and joining the band instead. I liked that they all seemed like shameless nerds. I found the band to be fun and welcoming, and it was refreshing to be in an organization that didn't require auditions to join. Every other club seemed so competitive.\n\nAlso I got a tutoring job that allowed me to make friends, too.\n\nI took initiative bonding with people by inviting them over to play videogames and watch movies in my dorm room.",

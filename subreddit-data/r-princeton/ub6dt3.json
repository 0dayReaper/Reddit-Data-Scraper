As I read this statement from Princeton, there appears to be no reason to take this exam, as credit isn\u2019t available for it, regardless of score.

The only one that could potentially get me credit is Physics C (mechanics only), but I can't get credit for that one because I'm not taking the E&amp;M exam. I'm not studying for any of my exams and hoping that Princeton won't rescind my admission if I fail a few of them lmao",

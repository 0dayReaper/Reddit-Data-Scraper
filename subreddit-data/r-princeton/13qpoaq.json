    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m an incoming first year and am working on my housing form right now and am struggling with selecting my preferred number of roommates.\n\nI am thinking about 2-3 roommates because I like meeting new people and making new friends, especially in the first year. Also, I have been an only child for my entire life, so I want to try something different. But, I am not an extrovert, and too much interaction can tire me out. Also, how big are the Princeton quads/triples? I would prefer my dorm to not feel too cramped. \n\nI am a little scared of choosing just 1 roommate because if I don't like that person, then I will be stuck with them all year. But I'm sure at Princeton most people are great. \n\n1 roommate is a safe option with lots of privacy, but I have been doing that my entire life, and I don't know if it's good for making friends and meeting people in the first year. \n\nSo, what would you recommend for me? If you have triple or quad experiences, I would love to know! \n\nThank you sm!",

Most people I\u2019ve talked to wished they had a single and got a single for sophomore year. It doesn\u2019t hurt your social life, and gives you 10x more freedom",

            "comment": "There is a pretty big range of sizes for quads and triples and some of them will feel cramped. However, you get the added space and privacy of having separate common rooms and bedrooms so you don't really always have to be in the same room as the rest of your roommates. If too much interaction tires you out, you could go for a single, but the odds of you getting one first year are low and realistically you have very little control over the type of room you get. I wouldn't try to get more roommates for the sole purpose of meeting people because you will have plenty of opportunities to meet and make friends with people you relate to in some way. In terms of getting one roommate, some doubles have a common room so you can sleep in separate rooms, but some don't.",

            "comment": "The questionnaire you fill out you gives the school a picture about you but whatever they give you is up to them.  \n\nRegardless of how you want to make friends or not, I'm sure there are clubs and extra curricular activities that you can get involved in.\n\nWhat I've learned about making friends is from a teacher who said the way to make friends is to like something that someone else likes.  There are many people who want friends but they don't if they don't like the same things and I can't just walk down the street, match any two people up and make them become friends.\n\nEveryone needs self care and down time to just vegetate (chill out) and get some space and rest but that may or may not be you.  Being around people too much means they could be irritating at the same time or they could be moody because they have class work to get done and if you don't have the perfect match, could it be remedied?  I don't know.  The reality is that friendships have friction and you wouldn't know until you are around people to feel that friction.  I've met people who were super nice to me but at the same time I got on their nerves for being around too much and that is when I realize I need to give them space and let them come to me because their niceness wasn't an indication they wanted to be friends.  I've met people at college who don't like the same sports team that I like and they don't have the same music interest that I have and we have very little in common to talk about.\n\nAnything on the questionnaire can be added up hour wise and the advisors can see what your day, week, month or semesters may look like.  It also depends on whether you need quiet to study or whether you can think with noise and interruptions going on around you.  \n\nI'm sure there are also other quiet areas of the college you can go to like the library to study.\n\nI didn't go to Princeton but for every hour of class in college, we had 3 or more hours of studying to do.  In other classes that were not from Princeton, I had twelve hour homework for just one class.  My friend who went to another college was upset that his teacher at his school was assigning 15 or 20 page papers.  I had a political science class where the professor wanted us to be \"poliholic\" which is a term he coined for a political alcoholic and watch 20 or more hours a week of politics on T.V. and I switched classes because I didn't have twenty hours of free time to watch television.\n\nI've watched some YouTube videos on Princeton and one student claimed he worked on an assignment for Princeton and it was 100 hours but I don't know if that will be statistically representative for everyone.  I honestly don't know what to expect for anyone but it all depends on what you can do and what you feel good about doing.\n\nIn colleges outside of Princeton, one college actually asked new students to give them your IRS 1040 form to see if you are working and they won't allow anyone who works to take more than two courses part time.  The reality is that you did great because you got into the number one school but also remember that you have to prioritize and budget your time on getting that degree.\n\nWe're not in kindergarten but I remember one celebrity singer tell the host on the radio she failed kindergarten because she was too busy making friends I guess.\n\nThe questionnaire also asks how how much time you spend cleaning or how much time you expect to clean and if you are roomed with a person who doesn't spend the same amount of time, could that be taxing or take away from your schedule if you decide to get a dorm up to your standards?  I believe they probably have a formula to keep people relatively happy as possible but I really don't know.\n\nI wish you the best at college.",

I'm an only-child and introvert, and I decided to go for a quad to meet people and because the more roommates, the more likely you'll mash with at least one of them. It worked out pretty well for me as, opposed to a one room double, you get a room and a common room, which allows for more space; and my roommates were cool. \n\nHowever, the worth of more space in your room deeply depends on if you get along with your roommates. Also, note that just because you have a roommate, that doesn't mean you'll become friends or even talk to each other much.",

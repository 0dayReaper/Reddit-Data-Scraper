    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI've been in the Navy for 10 years and I have 9 college credits, not including my Joint Service Transcript. \n\nRight now, I am working on the first year application because  Princeton is waving the SAT/ACT. I am hoping to convince admission officers with my college course GPA, LORs, and essays. Additionally, I've been working with Service to School on the application\n\nMy college course GPA is 3.7, while working full-time. My high school GPA is 2.8. I had a rough upbringing, and I have expressed how this experience effected my high school GPA within my essays. \n\nI wanted to see if there are any veterans or students on this subreddit who could answer my questions below. \n\nI am curious about applying for financial aid on the application or just saying no because of my GI Bill/Yellow Ribbon benefits.\n\nWhat is the culture surrounding non-traditional students at Princeton? \n\nWould you apply here again, if you had the opportunity to apply to different schools? \n\nDo you feel isolated as a military veteran? \n\nThanks for taking the time to read my post. \n\nV/R, \n\nLazy Sisyphus",

    "postText": "I have a film camera and a bunch of B&amp;W 35mm rolls lying around, but the local shop charges $14 for developing + $12 for scans. Which, I respect the expertise they bring, but that's *steep* on a grad student budget.\n\nAnyway, I saw the arts center offers an analog photography course, so I assume there's somewhere to develop and print on campus. Do you need to be taking a course to use it? And/or is there anywhere else with general student access?",

Users are responsible for their own supplies of paper. The College will supply chemicals, etc. To access the dark room, students can check out a key with the college office.\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t used it personally so I\u2019m not sure if its open to all students or not. But good luck!",

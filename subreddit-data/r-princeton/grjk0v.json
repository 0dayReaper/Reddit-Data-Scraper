            "comment": "The student quotes in this are pretty hilarious. Imagine getting caught cheating on your math homework and then trying to morally high road the person who caught you. The TA didn't do anything unsavory, they didn't suggest that people go look at cheat websites before posting a fake answer. If you weren't already looking to cheat this didn't affect you at all. Its like a bank robber complaining about marked money. The only thing I'm sympathetic to is exactly how long the punishment should be.\n\nApparently the trust between student and TA means they should let you cheat and be cool.\n\n&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t think a TA should ever do this, or ever take this power,\u201d they said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have that position \u2026 That\u2019s the position of professors, teachers, COD, other people. A TA is not there to create whatever traps for students and allow this to happen, and it seriously affects the trust that students could have.\u201d\n\nOr how about \"Hey yeah we totally cheated, but they look at this asshole who caught us. I was just browsing Slader. I wasn't going to cheat until I saw that irresistible answer\"\n\n&gt;One of the accused students who spoke to the \u2018Prince\u2019 said they were conflicted in their views on the situation. They noted that students \u201cweren\u2019t forced to go onto Slader,\u201d but they also said that \u201ctwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right.\u201d   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cIf you cheated or did something wrong, that\u2019s wrong. But I also believe that trust and mutual respect goes both ways, and to have a TA doing that on their own accord is just not something that should be happening at Princeton,\u201d they added. \u201cThat I think is completely wrong, and I think the math department needs to come out and state that that\u2019s wrong.\u201d",

Once students were sent home, they all had to experience the course in very different environments. Math dept really could not have cared less. I actually think Slader is a really awesome resource for either checking your work or seeing the process of a solution to better understand how it's done. Using Slader like this falls within the rules stated in the syllabus that \"*You may check your computations using a calculator or any other technology while doing homework, but you must include most hand calculations in your written submission to receive full credit*\". But outright copying off of it is like abusing the site and not at all its intended purpose. Personally, I didn't have time to do the HW after everything went crazy, but I said fuck it didn't turn anything in and took the L. And although I feel like it's obvious that a fraction of 15% of your grade isn't worth getting caught cheating, some people might be so wrapped up in everything and overly anxious that they'd get desperate enough to copy work from Slader. Should they be penalized for copying homework solutions? Yes. Should the punishment be one year's suspension??? Naw man.",

    "postText": "I know I'm overthinking this, but it's grating on me to sit for two months without any clue as to where I'm going to be in August and I have to ask. When I was putting together my application, I'd left it unfinished for a while, and I got an email from an associate dean that contained a reminder to submit the application and a code for a fee waiver.\n\nI had never requested a fee waiver. So I'm curious, is this normal? If you leave your graduate application unfinished, does administration just send you the code for the waiver because they want you to apply? Or is it possible the department looked at what my unfinished application had in it already and liked what they saw?",

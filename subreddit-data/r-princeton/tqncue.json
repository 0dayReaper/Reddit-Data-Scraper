    "postText": "I just got home from a tour of Princeton, and it was absolutely amazing and beautiful. One thing I learned on the tour was about \"concentrations\" and \"certificates\" being like majors and minors. Is it possible to earn a concentration in CS and a certificate in music composition, or potentially both concentrations? I did my own very cursory research and it looks like there is no available music composition certificate, which is a bit disheartening because I'm very interested in composition and nowhere near as much in performance. Please correct me if I'm wrong! Any advice or explainations are appreciated!",

You also have very few requirements as a COS major, so you have a ton of flexibility to take courses in other departments (and you definitely should!)",

Each major has certain requirements but beyond that your dept determines your adviser and your thesis. Real talk a COS degree is just better for life. If you're all in on music do that but you can get everything you need out of the music dept without majoring. Dan Trueman and Jeff Snyder are the music/COS people to investigate..!",

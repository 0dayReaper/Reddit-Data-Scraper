    "postText": "So I was accepted into Princeton. The only thing is I'm from the south and have seen snow twice in my life. What jackets do people who have lived in Princeton's climate recommend? (Also, when do they usually go on sale?) I was thinking a puffer jacket but there's so many kinds and they're so expensive...I need help. Thanks!",

I like their puffers a lot and compared to other brands they're pretty generously priced. As to when they go on sale... probably right around now, I would say, due to the holiday environment, and also maybe when the seasons change (they'll likely mark down winter apparel when spring rolls around.) \n\nI got a coat from the North Face last Christmas and though it was on the pricier side, it's warm and durable \u2014 I'm going to be using it for the next few years at least. \n\nHopefully this is helpful! And HAPPY NEW YEAR!",

Lots of types could work -  do you have a budget to share perhaps? Best thing is to just wear lots of layers. \n\nAnd you know, NJ rarely gets \\*that\\* cold if we're being honest (spoken as another person who lived in the south until going to Princeton).",

My budget is probably around 200, hopefully less, but I\u2019d rather get a more expensive quality one if that\u2019s not a reasonable price range.\n\nI guess what kinds of stuff do you frequently wear/see others wearing? Lightweight puffed jackets or just layers etc.?",

You can always wear a sweatshirt or something underneath that for warmth in the winter. Some brands like Patagonia sell a layered jacket which has both the waterproof shell and the warm inner lining. That could be one way to get a versatile layer.\n2) good boots. You can find Timberlands on sale pretty frequently. They don\u2019t have to be waterproof, but if they\u2019re leather / suede, you can waterproof them yourself with a spray pretty easily (look up camping waterproof sprays). This is a big one imo, since in the winter it\u2019ll be slushy or icy or snowy and that sucks to walk on with sneakers. I\u2019ve had my pair of Timberland boots for 6 years now and they\u2019re going strong, just need re-waterproofing every other year.",

You need a fairly warm coat, puffers parkas and peacoats are all good bets. It is fairly expensive to get a good one but definitely worth it, as it's something you will have for many years. \n\nI would personally suggest Arcteryx/Columbia for puffers and Fjallraven/Columbia for parkas, all three bands are reliable and stylish.\n\nNot sure about peacoats I'm not familiar with the big brands.",

            "comment": "I'd definitely recommend a parka/puffer though they can be pretty easy to overheat in - you probably wanna reserve them for sub-freezing temperatures IMO unless you're gonna be outside for like 30 minutes straight (walking to class quickly for 10 minutes in one is a recipe for overheating). It might only be that cold for a few stretches of winter but you'll be happy you had it for sure. \n\nFor warmer temperatures I'd recommend something like a quilted jacket. Idk if I'd recommend a specific one, I've had one from JCrew for years and years (actually bought it when I was a junior about 8 years ago). That's better for throwing on over a hoodie and keeping warm if you're gonna relatively active, like power walking to class.\n\nOh also, I've always sized down on jackets/outerwear! Especially something bulky like a coat, it can be really easy for it to be boxy and unflattering. So if you care about that, I'd look at something a size down from your usual size (I buy small coats and I'm a medium otherwise)",

Instead, get a down jacket that\u2019s reasonably warm (I bought [this Northface jacket](https://www.thenorthface.com/shop/mens-aconcagua-2-jacket-nf0a4r29?variationId=JK3) recently), and layer up with flannel shirts and fleeces and you\u2019ll be good to go for 99% of the cold you\u2019ll experience in New Jersey.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone. I was recently admitted as a transfer student and wanted to know if any current students had recommendations as far as resources that would help me with my Spanish. I don't matriculate to Princeton for a few more months but I am trying to be as prudent as possible about this, as I've heard that Princeton's language courses are no joke. Any materials or resources that you could provide would be greatly appreciated. I am already using LingoPie and have purchased a textbook from my local community college. Thank you so much for the help!",

I\u2019m not sure how much experience you already have, but just take the placement test. Introductory language classes are usually 5 days a week, which is annoying, but it gives you plenty of time to practice. I would not recommend going out and buying a bunch of expensive resources right now unless you really want to. Over the summer, do Duolingo or other free apps to practice vocab, and watch YouTube videos for listening/comprehension. I started ITA 102-7 this spring and was close to dropping it because I thought everyone was so much better than me, but it just took a few weeks to get used to it, and now I can speak Italian fairly well. \n\nGood luck!",

    "postText": "Jeez \u2026\n\n\u201cA true Renaissance woman, Princeton\u2019s valedictorian has proved herself an extraordinary scholar and research scientist, and has also starred in stage plays and written stories and poetry, all while earning 10 A+\u2019s in courses from six different departments, including English and psychology as well as molecular biology (her concentration) and quantitative and computational biology (her certificate program). At Princeton, A+ grades require written justifications from the professors. Over the course of her four years, Orlovsky earned no grade below an A.\u201d\n\n\nhttps://www.princeton.edu/news/2022/04/25/natalia-orlovsky-named-princeton-valedictorian-frances-mangina-selected",

For example Stanford doesn\u2019t have Valedictorian/Salutatorian or merit based scholarships or any big awards that puts anyone above others. All students are already incredible at these top schools, there\u2019s no point singling out \u2018incredible\u2019 individuals, and even then I don\u2019t think grades are the right metric in this case anyways",

I guess I just don\u2019t really see it making anything much worse either. It strikes me as pointless at worst. I admit, though, it was sort of cool to hear about her and I probably wouldn\u2019t have had there been no valedictorian. And I suspect she would have had no less impressive a career at Princeton without that distinction being there to achieve. Doubt very much she strove like that in order to become valedictorian.",

    "postText": "What would you recommend if you were in my shoes? Disregard financial aid/cost. What makes this choice really difficult is that I have been selected as an Egleston Scholar, a distinction given to top 1% of Columbia Engineering where we get 10k research stipend, enhanced financial aid, direct faculty mentor (each student has a specific faculty mentor), and some other perks). I like Princeton as well but I don\u2019t like the idea of not being able to have more than one major (certificate system). What school do you think is harder in terms of GPA deflation or general difficulty of CS? How hard is it to switch majors? How is the general community at Princeton? Any advice is appreciated.",

Now I do not quite like Princeton, but Columbia is a garbage sundae with extra black licorice on top (by which I mean **I would rather join the Army as canon-fodder than attend Columbia on a full ride**). \n\nIf you want to get a idiotic core curriculum with a cut-throat culture in a crumbling city choose Columbia.

From the other side of it (I'm a grad student here), I think that if you're planning on doing CS research in the future (i.e. an MS or PhD), you definitely want to go with Columbia. For a future in research the prestigious scholarship and the easy opportunity it gives you for undergrad research is going to help you stand out a lot.",

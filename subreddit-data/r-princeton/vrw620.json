    "postText": "Hey! I'm a '25 undergrad, so I'll be a sophomore next year. I think it would be sooooo convenient to have my car close to campus, but of course the University doesn't usually give parking permits to underclassmen. I've heard from many students that you can just park your car on the streets 10-15 mins away, and move it around once a week-ish so it (probably) won't be stolen. I'm trying to decide if that would be worth it.\n\nFor example, I've seen people on Reddit suggest Lytle Street, Jefferson Road by the cemetery, far down Prospect Avenue, etc. But I've also heard that it's illegal to park overnight on Princeton Municipality streets? I'm not sure how well that law is enforced though, if at all.\n\nI'm also just concerned with how easy it would be to find a spot. If I have to search for 30 minutes each time that would not be ideal.\n\nCan anyone who's gone through this experience give me some practical advice? Would greatly appreciate any and all tips!! Thanks a bunch.",

I think you\u2019re walking 15 minutes or more especially when there\u2019s events going on. Why not rely on zipcar for the rare occasion when you\u2019d want a car? Bikes are much better for navigating the campus and town.",

A bike will get you anywhere you need to in the area surrounding campus, the weekend shopper will get you to the mall, and the train will get you anywhere along the northeast corridor (Philly, Trenton, NYC, New Brunswick, Newark, airport). Enterprise car share and zipcar are options, as are Uber/Lyft.",

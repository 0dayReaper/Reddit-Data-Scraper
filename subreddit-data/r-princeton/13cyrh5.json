            "comment": "Can\u2019t speak to the specific experience of women on campus generally, but the area around the university is a relatively low crime area so that\u2019s something. That being said, the lighting in a lot of areas is really poor and I have had multiple women I know say they feel unsafe walking around at night for that reason. Other than that, from what I\u2019ve heard from students, it\u2019s your typical college atmosphere for women. Less outright sexual assault but I\u2019ve been told there\u2019s a big stalking problem, and some of the faculty (one of which at least is gone) are basically known harassers/misogynists. Not sure to what extent Princeton is unique in that respect though. \n\nAs for the queer community, it doesn\u2019t seem to be particularly active, but that may be because I haven\u2019t sought it out. I know they have events and what not, but it felt like in my undergrad uni the LGBTQ+ center was definitely more present. But the general atmosphere does seem pretty queer-friendly, at least relatively so. Sorry that I couldn\u2019t give any more solid answers! Feel free to ask if you want to know anything else",

On tours, they talk about the resources. I can\u2019t speak to the actual experience but it looks like they are pretty queer friendly. I also noticed a lot of pride flags, at least on the eating club houses and throughout the area.",

Plus there's independent affinity groups for grad students and staff.\n\nIf by active you mean a party scene, there doesn't seem to be much of one. (But that was never my thing so I haven't gone looking.) We're close to Philly and NYC, so I think a lot of people just go clubbing there if they want that.",

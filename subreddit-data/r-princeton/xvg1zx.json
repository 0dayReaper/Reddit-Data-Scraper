    "postText": " Hello everyone.\n\nI wanted to see if there are any possible interest for MTG (Magic the Gathering) on campus. I manage one of the makerspaces on campus. What I hope for the makerspace is to create a space that is more than a space to make, but for students to hang out and have fun. With that I want to host different events to bring people together, introduce the space, and have some fun.\n\nOne idea I have been having was a casual MTG event. There will be food and we do a casual Booster Draft with one of the older sets, such as Core Set 2019, some prizes at the end (3D printed deck box maybe?). I am thinking the event would be free. participants wouldn't keep the cards we open and use, but there will be some packs everyone gets.\n\nIf there are enough interest in this idea/post. I will move forward with hosting this event.",

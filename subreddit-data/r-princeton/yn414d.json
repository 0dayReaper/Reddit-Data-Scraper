    "postText": "Hello! I'm a student at the University of Michigan currently working on a research project studying how disability impacts students' experiences at tier 1 universities. If this applies to you please consider taking a moment to fill out my survey! It only takes a few minutes (9 questions) and would help me out with my project a lot!

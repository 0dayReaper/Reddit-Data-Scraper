    "postText": "I am intending to major in mechanical engineering with a minor or certificate in sustainability or/and robotics. I have a few questions about engineering at Princeton.\n\nWhat machine shops and makerspaces are available to students?\n\nHow real-world or hands on are courses?\n\nWhat are median grades like in intro courses?\n\nIs the culture more competitive or collaborative?\n\nWhat is the workload like? Do people still have lives outside of school?\n\nDo you think Princeton engineering prepares you well for a career in engineering?\n\nThanks! For reference, other options are uc Berkeley, Ucla, northwestern, Hopkins, Dartmouth, washu, and Umich.",

            "comment": "I'm MAE. The culture is definitely more collaborative within MAE courses (not sure about the others).\n\nThe workload is pretty tough for some of the intro MAE courses and first year courses. I strongly suggest taking the engineering math/physics requirements and not PHY 103/104 and MAT 201/202. Most people take the PHY and MAT ones since they fulfill the same requirements as the engineering ones, but they're poorly taught IMO and they focus too much on theory (which engineers don't care about).",

                    "comment": "&gt;There's a solid MAE shop (shout-out to Glenn and Al!) and good shop for the general engineering school. Physics also has a shop but I've never used it. There's a few makerspaces too. You'll have plenty of opportunities to get your hands dirty out of class.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Some of the courses that are very hands on too, either in the shop or in some other lab. Junior design in shop-based and a cornerstone of the program.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Grades are tough but don't come here if you want straight As. Come to Princeton if you want to be really challenged.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Some people are collaborative, some people suck. Overall I never felt like it was cutthroat. We're all in the wringer together.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Workload is intense. See my point about Princeton being the place for people who want the greatest challenge. But you can have a life. Just don't expect to have a life AND have good grades AND sleep enough. Something will always have to give (which thing that is varies week to week).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As to the real-world applicability of courses and career preparedness, know this: Princeton does not focus the program to training engineers at all. The focus is training engineering professors. A huge percentage go straight to ph.ds. There are tons of opportunities for research, fewer for co-ops. Most professors spend their entire career in academia, not industry. I'm in the minority of my class as someone who actually works in the mechanical engineering industry.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That said, I wouldn't have my current job if it wasn't for the research I did with a big name prof. My current boss recognized the name and was impressed, although I am in R&amp;D. Manufacturing engineering roles will care much less about research, but then again basically no colleges teach manufacturing engineering anyways.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;l have a better understanding of the fundamental physics behind engineering than my coworkers from most other schools. But if you want to walk the industry path (don't decide now--you still have years ahead of you) you'll want to put in the effort to get industry internships and such and not just be a post-doc in training in someone's lab.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Overall, it's an amazing school. The opportunities are there if you go for them, but understand that the focus is academia, not industry.\n\nThank you! This is super helpful and saved me a potential waste of four years!",

                            "comment": "Despite the fact that MAE isn't as hands-on, there are tons of opportunities to make it more hands-on. They have engineering clubs that routinely use the machine shop and you can make pretty much anything you want because of Princeton's huge budget. The MAE courses are very small and I've had relationships with many of the professors because the courses have been so small (which I don't think I would've had if the courses had been larger). All of the MAE professors want you to succeed and really don't want you to fail their courses or struggle. Also when you're a junior, you can work in independent work and pretty much do anything while being mentored by a professor (which is super cool!!!!). This means by the time you graduate, you'll have two projects + two professors you worked closely with (which make great letter of recommendations)",

It is a great school, just probably not for me. Prestige isn't really a factor because I have other options so it doesn't seem to make since for me.",

I was a computer science major but still managed to spend basically a full year getting aluminum shavings and cooling fluid in my hair because I made friends and wrote a backend to let Pro/E drive one of the CNC milling machines (it was sitting idle because it was donated and incompatible with any software we had). Fantastic experience.",

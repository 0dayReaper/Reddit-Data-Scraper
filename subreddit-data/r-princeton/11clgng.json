Most undergraduate students don't understand this, but it is the reality. That said, graduate students don't teach classes, they teach precepts (sections that go with lecture classes) so undergraduate students are taught by members of the faculty. That sets it apart from many other schools.",

                    "comment": "&gt; No graduate schools like Law, Medicine, Business, \n\nYou meant no *professional* schools. Law school, medical school, and business school do not (typically) lead to graduate degrees. You don't get a PhD in law, for instance. While some medical students get a PhD after the MD, it is really rare since practicing physicians just need the MD degree.  A doctor wanting a PhD would be aiming for a career in medical research.\n\nhttps://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/graduate-school-vs-professional-school\n\nPrinceton has a graduate school and some of its PhD programs are among the top in the world.  So not all the focus is on undergraduates (but a lot is). \n\n&gt; 99% of undergrads live on campus all 4 years.\n\nYour 99% was surely not meant to be a precise figure, and in that spirit the overwhelming majority of students at Stanford also live on campus all 4 years. Just think about the housing costs in Palo Alto. \n\n&gt; Everyone writes a senior thesis.\n\nThat's true for BA students, but not for all BSE students.\n\nhttps://www.cs.princeton.edu/ugrad/independent-work/bse-senior",

Even if you are BSE and not writing one, the thesis experience defines senior year, if only because it is all everyone talks about.",

Alumni participation indicates that people feel the time they had at the school was valuable to them. Princeton is consistently ranked number one in alumni giving.",

I\u2019m probably old enough to be your mother. Please take my advice: where you go to college is as important as the ranking of the institution. MIT is on the edge of Cambridge and can have wicked winters. It can snow there in April. Princeton is beautiful and has four seasons. Since you mentioned East Coast schools, I imagine you want to be there. However, I will mention that CalTech and Harvey Mudd may offer majors suited to your interests and there\u2019s better weather in California.",

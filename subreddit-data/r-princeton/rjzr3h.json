Princeton students are not some special echelon of society. They just look for, beyond academic performance, people that are passionate and dedicated in their other interests (doesn\u2019t necessarily mean clubs or sports). Even so it\u2019s not like people who are just checking boxes in HS don\u2019t also get in. Tl;dr admissions are a crapshoot past a point.",

I've written all the essays filled in my extracurricular activities but I'm not sure if they're good enough. I'm not sure what parts I should improve on. I was wondering if anyone had the free time to go over them for me and send me feedback. If anybody's intrested please contact me. Application deadline is in 3 weeks, I wanted to do some last minute checks.\nThank you.",

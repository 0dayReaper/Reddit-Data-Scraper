    "postText": "Hi everyone! I just wanted to ask whether it's a good idea to use Linux on my computer, as I am going into Electrical and Computer Engineering. I've used Linux for many years, and I really don't want to switch to anything else unless I absolutely have to. Is there any software that's needed that cannot be run on Linux, and if so, could I just run it in a Windows virtual machine or something like that?  I would appreciate any advice y'all might have. Thanks!",

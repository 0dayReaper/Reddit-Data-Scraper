    "postText": "Hello everyone, I'm a 22-year-old undergrad from the University at Buffalo. I have an internship on the Princeton Campus this summer and looking for housing options. Anything close to a train station or Princeton will do. Not too particular about the type of housing, but would like my own private bedroom. My stay will be preferably from May 29th till August 19th. If your preferred dates vary a bit from that, it's fine. We can still talk and see if we can make it work. If you have any availability or know of any, please dm me. Thanks.",

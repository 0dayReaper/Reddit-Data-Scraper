    "postText": "I noticed many alums commenting something along the lines of: most college experiences last 4 years, but Princeton lasts forever.\n\nCould any alum (undergrad or phd) comment on what this means specifically? Are the alumni relations really that strong? How do people generally engage in the community after Princeton? How have you found your post-Princeton experience? Comparisons to other schools if you attended more than one school would also be great. Or links to articles answering the question I'm describing.",

Annual giving is one example - it not only exceeds the annual giving total of other, larger, ivies, but the percentage of donation participation far exceeds other universities. I just passed my 15th reunion and our class exceeds 75% participation in annual giving each year. \n\nAnother facet of the alumni network is that it is everywhere. State schools networks largely remain in-state but I\u2019ve moved every 3 years since graduating and have always going alumni wherever I go. \n\nFinally, reunions. There\u2019s nothing like it. Many people go every year for their lifetime. And the university honors that. It\u2019s basically the best marketing gig out there. I went to my law school 10 year reunion and it was pathetic and embarrassing in comparison.",

You don\u2019t feel peer pressure unless you are, in fact, peers and care about that social pressure. For example, I\u2019m getting lots of pressure to donate to a lot of politicians at the moment. None of that pressure is meaningful enough to me to actually do it. But I care about my relationship with Princeton, so when they ask, I donate. That\u2019s still a meaningful indicator, regardless of what you name it. \n\nSame goes with \u201ccult.\u201d It\u2019s a negative term, but generally refers to a close knit shared community. My husband loves his cross fit gym - I think that\u2019s a cult, but whatever. He enjoys it. And, let\u2019s be honest, people go to elite schools because they are exclusive. There\u2019s got to be something about the Ivy vibe that gets you, because state school would be a fuck ton cheaper. If that\u2019s a cult, okay.",

It\u2019s also a great way to familiarize yourself with some parts of the campus and the surrounding town.",

If you get financial aid, they likely will pay for all/some of the costs, if that\u2019s the worry. If you don\u2019t get financial aid, then just go, it\u2019s worth the cost to get there.",

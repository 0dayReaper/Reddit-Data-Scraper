Writing sem is going to be challenging no matter what, but she is so great at giving constructive feedback and being supportive so you will learn a ton! Strongly recommend especially if you are interested in sustainability in any way.",

The topics were unusual (e.g. movie about an old man weirdly invested in his dog\u2019s love life), but the class itself was on the easier side. Dr. Peh was super nice and seemed very willing to give extra feedback and extensions. In my experience, writing sem is challenging at the start but gets a lot better once you adjust",

The work wasn't too bad, and I enjoyed the topics (as it was about conspiracies, we did Flat Earth, Aliens, and then choose a conspiracy). Recommend if you want to think differently about how people approach, invent, and adhere to conspiracies.",

            "comment": "Yes! The Davis IC website has important information regarding visa applications. As an international student, you will have an advisor who will guide you through the visa application process. I recommend you book a Zoom appointment with your assigned advisor as soon as possible, as they will be able to guide you through the process, and you will need documentation from the Davis IC (in my case, an I-20 form, but this might change depending on where you are from and the type of visa you will apply for). \n\n[Here](https://davisic.princeton.edu/new-students-scholars/new-students) is a link to the Davis IC\u2019s guide for new students.\n\n[Here](https://davisic.princeton.edu/about-us/advising-appointments) is the page containing information on who your advisor is, and how to book a Zoom appointment with them. There are virtual drop-ins available throughout the week, and they can also be reached via email for relatively straightforward questions. \n\nPlease let me know if the links don\u2019t work. If you have any further questions or concerns, do feel free to DM me! Advisors are extremely kind and patient, and they will be a great resource during your Princeton journey.",

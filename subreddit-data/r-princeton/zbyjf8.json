If over time enough students ask for a class, faculty in a department may recognize there\u2019s demand for it. In turn, the idea might find its way into faculty meetings and someone may step forward to teach it. \n\nI created a new course at my current school (Cornell). The new course needed to go through a pretty formal approval process, where the dean and other faculty members had to sign off. It was a lot of work to get off the ground.\n\nIndependent Studies and theses are more realistic mechanisms in the short run. They work differently at different institutions \u2014 I don\u2019t remember how they work at Princeton.",

            "comment": "Just wanted to chime in with a slightly more optimistic take! It ultimately comes down to whether there's a professor who's really interested in the same subject and what your relationship with them is like, but I have had multiple opportunities to \"create\" a course with a professor because I got lucky in finding someone with very similar interests. The person was technically a lecturer, so I'm not sure if that gave them more freedom to create courses.\n\nFirst, there is the possibility of creating a [reading course](https://odoc.princeton.edu/curriculum/special-academic-programs/reading-courses), which anecdotally can happen pretty easily if you have a good relationship with the professor. Also, I once randomly brought up the idea of having a course on a certain subject with a professor, and he made it happen the next semester. I understand that this is the exception, but it is possible if the relationship is there and the interest/excitement about the topic is mutual.",

It may be possible for you to take a reading course that they design, although this probably varies by department. Also, the amount you actually get out of such a class would vary dramatically by professor. But it may be worth a shot.",

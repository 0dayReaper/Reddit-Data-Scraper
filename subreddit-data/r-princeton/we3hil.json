Anyway, people will drop when they start scheduling their other courses, so their will be openings, and there are so many good sems to choose from",

I did some research- it looks like freshman seminars are WAY more popular this year than they were last(or the years before that). I\u2019d recommend applying for some in the spring if those interest you- otherwise, not the end of the world. \nIf you\u2019re mainly disappointed about missing out on those specific classes, there are SO many cool classes at Princeton, and many that look similar to some of the freshman seminars. If you had a favorite seminar, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to look at the professors to see what similar courses they teach. Then, you can probably take the same course in a few years!\nOtherwise, it\u2019s definitely too bad. Good luck!",

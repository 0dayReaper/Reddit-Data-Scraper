Look for 100% cotton. \n\nThe biggest store for dorm bedding in the U.S. is Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. They have anything you could possibly need for a dorm room. Check out their website because you could have something specific delivered when you get your mailing address. There is a BB&amp;B store in nearby Lawrenceville, NJ but you\u2019ll have to take a Lyft or Uber.",

I would just bring sheets from home since they don\u2019t take up much space, and either buy a pillow and comforter when you get here or order online once you get your mailing address.",

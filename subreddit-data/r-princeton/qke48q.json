    "postText": "Hi, I'm currently applying restrictive early action to Princeton, but I just realized that I couldnt just self-report scores on Commonapp, and rather have to send them officially. I'm requesting the scores to be sent today through the rush option -- how bad would it be if Princeton admissions didn't get my official scores until after the Nov. 1st deadline? Should I send them an email explaining? Thanks!",

For instance, last cycle, I applied to another Ivy for early action and asked a similar question (though, not about test scores), and they said they just keep that information on file till they get the rest per a reasonable amount of time.\n\nTldr; you're probably fine, but send an e-mail instead of asking Reddit.",

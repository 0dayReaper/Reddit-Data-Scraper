    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI'm an undergrad here at Princeton, and I've recently developed an interest in drums, and I want to learn to play them. I'm assuming there's some place here at Princeton where I could learn to play, but I'm not sure where. My schedule for the semester is really full, so I can't really take a class with the Department of Music, and I feel like most clubs want people who have experience. Does anybody know where I could go if I'm a total beginner? Thanks",

What level are you hoping to reach?\n\nIf you just want to learn to play basic rock drum set, imo it would make most sense to learn on your own from YouTube and whatnot - there\u2019s usually a drum set in the Forbes music room, and there are a few others around campus I think - reach out to the PURE people to see if you can get some practice time on the drum set they use. The music department generally is unhelpful unless you\u2019re taking full lessons with them or are in an ensemble with them.\n\nIf you want to learn more complex drum set or jazz or something and want actual proper technique or advanced snare knowledge, you should probably bite the bullet and get lessons. Music department lessons for most instruments don\u2019t cater to beginners, but you can reach out and ask - signup is at the beginning of each semester. Department lessons are pretty expensive; even if you\u2019re on full aid they typically only subsidize half the price (unless you\u2019re in an ensemble/a major, but you\u2019re not). They might be able to set you up with a grad student though, which might be more reasonable. Your best option though would likely be to find a local teacher with a studio.\n\nIf you are interested in atypical types of drums, there are music courses on steel drums and African drums offered each semester, which are a lot of fun and great 5th classes.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in playing marching drums (snare, quads, or bass drum), join the band. They don\u2019t require any experience/knowledge/commitment, and will help you get started.",

    "postText": "I am planning to apply to Princeton for a PhD in English. The dept webpage says that they'll give full financial aid during the 5 years of study. I'm an international student, and need to be sure that there's no loopholes in this. I'm sorry if this is weird, but it's my first time applying to grad schools in the US. Is funding guaranteed if I get accepted? Or do you recommend I talk to the graduate admissions director about this? \n\nTIA",

I have a pretty good CV here at my current university and didn't know how my chances were.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was also wondering if anyone knew about any limits to transferring credits, I will technically be a junior by the time I admitted and I have found nothing on if these credits will transfer or not. I hope to see you all on campus in the fall!",

I'm not sure if they stopped publishing these stats last year, too, but you should still be able to find news articles from when they (re?)began admitting transfers a few years back. The goals of the program are quite specific and the slots are very limited.",

In other words, the possiblity of you needing to retake classes or push your grad date a year or two is very likely.\n\nThe transfer acceptance rate is in the low single digits (like 4-5% i dont know verbatim), and the first year acceptance rate is not only slightly higher but first years get alot more resources than transfers for obvious reasons.\n\nI hope it all works out for you!",

            "comment": "I mean the whole grades thing is a multi-sided issue. Yes, there was deflation but as another commenter has said, it's gone now.\n\nPrinceton is an undergraduate-focused school. That means, in general, professors are excited about teaching and want to help undergraduates on their academic starts, more so than other universities where research/graduate students might be their priority, and undergraduates an afterthought. Of course, this isn't true across the board, but I found it to be mostly accurate. \n\nSo really, what this means is that professors care about their course work and many aren't just going to rubberstamp good grades. At other schools (which start with H and rhyme with Barvard), the *average great* awarded is an A. I think it's very much worth asking whether the average student is so smart that they earn an A, or if the grading quality (and education, as a whole) that they're receiving is somewhat suspect.\n\nPoint being, grades can be tougher, but I think it's partially the result of generally working harder (which is a good thing when you're learning more).",

If you\u2019re not going to grad school, don\u2019t take the mathematical versions of the core courses and you\u2019ll be cruising through. Not much grade deflation in econ.\n\nAn example of a grade deflation remnant, though, is the math department (which you\u2019ll need some multivariable course to enter the econ department). Intro math course exams are now way harder to counteract the lack of grade deflation.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing to worry about though.",

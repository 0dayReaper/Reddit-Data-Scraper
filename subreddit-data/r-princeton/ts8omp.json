    "postText": "Hello! I'm a prospective freshman (accepted REA) and was looking through Princeton's course catalog for the 2022-2023 school year. I stumbled across HUM216 and HUM217\u2014both part of the HUM sequence\u2014and grew more interested in the course offerings here at Princeton. I was wondering if anyone on this subreddit took this course sequence and hopefully could provide their insight on it as well. Additionally, what were some memorable courses you took during your freshman year/what was your freshman year course-load? I appreciate the help in advance!!",

COS 226 (Algorithms and Data Structures) was also good. What do you mean by \"what was your freshman year course-load\"? Like how many courses did I take?",

Of those, I kinda regretted MOL 215 just because it didn't go too far beyond what I'd learned in high school. Would've been nice to have taken a couple other courses instead. It was well taught, though.",

I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s incredibly rewarding and fulfilling, but it\u2019s also incredibly time consuming, difficult, and becomes an identity for many. In my opinion, I wouldn\u2019t take it if you don\u2019t have an English-themed major as a goal - but that\u2019s just an outside perspective",

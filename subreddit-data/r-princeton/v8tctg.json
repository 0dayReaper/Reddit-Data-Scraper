Students continue to struggle to be heard and get justice when a professor engages in sexual harassment, racism or other abusive actions. There is often pressure to remain quiet while the University works to suppress details. \nr/abuse_by_professors is a community to share incidents of abuse by professors to shed light on the scope of violations by professors.",

            "comment": "I did not have that experience at  Princeton as a grad student.  Coming from a city is different, but there\u2019s Tiger Transit, NJ transit (bus and train accessible close to campus), and biking trails. Cars are preferable, but if you don\u2019t have one it isn\u2019t an issue.  I didn\u2019t have a car for my first year and was fine. \n\nI think it also depends on your  department/ program.  Mine was very tight-knight and supportive.  There is a new Graduate School Dean who (I believe) is making graduate students more of a priority.  \n\nYes food and drinks are a bit limited and cost $$ if you are coming from a city.  After a while the food options feel limited. There are different restaurants, just saying it feels limited based on what you find in a city.  Some places also have discounts if you are a student so ask! \n\nReunions are awesome!  Yes, more undergrads attend, but that\u2019s because they have larger classes.  Many grad students  attended when they were here and some come back every 5 years.  It\u2019s a lot of fun! \n\nI\u2019m sorry the commenter has not had a good experience, I would reach out to other students in your program and see how they feel.",

Both in class and in lab (senior thesis or junior independent studies folks in STEM major). I've also met many AMAZING undergrads, and I truly appreciate them. Again, it's always those very few that get under my skin.\n\nI'm becoming a 4th-year grad student next semester, and I think I've learned to tune out those mental stressors eventually.",

For example, the campus shuttle system was great during the school year but would nearly shut down during the summer.",

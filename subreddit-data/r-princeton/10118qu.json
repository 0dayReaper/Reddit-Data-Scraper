    "postText": "Hello friends! Hope you are having a great start to 2023. \n\nI am reaching out to all because I am interested in hearing about low stats success stories about students who got into SIPA\u2019s MPA program. \n\nI am planning on applying to SIPA in a couple of years and am a bit worried about my GPA because it is a bit on the lower end (think 3.4-3.6 range).\n\nWould love to hear some success stories, and what other areas you believe were helpful for success in the admission process. \n\nCheers!",

For grad apps your \"stats\" go a lot further than your GPA so it's hard to know what your potential actually is without those. Maybe ask r/gradadmissions though since usually this sub doesn't discuss admissions much.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! I am a student entering his final year of bachelors and I am trying to orient myself towards graduate education. I could really use your expertise and knowledge about the MSC Computer Science. First of all, let me provide some background information.\n\nI am doing a bachelor in Computer Science with Software Development with a Year in Industry at The University of Liverpool. Both in my first and second year of uni I\u2019ve achieved a first class honours average, although I did have a module each year that was not graded well (first year I was taking an exam remotely because of covid and there was a power outage, and the second time it was a group project where one of my team mates had testicle surgery, another one just did not present himself at all, and another one was not interested too much, leaving only me and another guy to do the project); during my year in industry I\u2019ve joined a company as a software developer / machine learning engineer and nailed it, getting another first class and I am continuing my employment as a Junior Artificial Intelligence Engineer whilst finishing my final year. Furthermore, during my final year I will be a seminar demonstrator for COMP111 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and I am also the vice president (if not president following some weird events that are irrelevant) of the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence society at uni.\n\nNow, the thing is I can\u2019t afford education at all as I come from lower to middle class Romania.\n\nI understand that MSC Computer Science students receive TA or RA positions that fund their studies and living expenses.\n\nCould you please provide me some more information regarding this matter?\n\nAlso, what would be my chances of admission? Assuming I will continue the good work and achieve a first class in my last year as well.\n\nWhat is the admission process? Please do provide any extra details if they might be useful.\n\nWould you consider Princeton a good place to pursue further education in artificial intelligence?\n\nPlease do leave any other information that might be useful. Thank you for your time and attention!",

You typically would act as the \"preceptor\" (TA) for one class or one of multiple if it's a large class, and your expenses are paid.\n\nI'm not going to speculate on your chances. I'd just apply and find out when you find out.\n\n[Admissions requirements](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/grad/admissions-requirements)",

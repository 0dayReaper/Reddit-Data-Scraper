    "postText": "I applied to Princeton's department of French and Italian with the intention of studying French. While the official department website does mention the more personal aspect of being a part of the department (smaller class size, more interaction with professors, international study opportunities, etc.), I wanted to confirm with actual students. How is course flexibility, social interactions within and outside of the department, and the overall quality and style of education?\n\nThanks!",

The upper level department courses do vary from year to year, with some popular ones coming back over and over. I found that my advisors were super helpful and engaged with me when it came time for JPs and thesis. Feel free to DM me if you want to ask anything specific :)",

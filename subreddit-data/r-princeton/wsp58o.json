            "comment": "Not sure how much of it has been knocked down but certain dorms (e.g. Walker) are beautiful, and all very central to campus and close to frist campus center! Definitely no AC there though so bring a fan (or 2!) - the first two weeks of the year are usually the most brutal. Rooms range from tiny singles to 7 person suites (honestly they probs wont fill it to capacity so you might be able to get a huge room that is under-occupied which could be nice) If you know your hall I can give you more specific information. They first dorms are definitely old and a bit grimy but people have lived there for a whole year for decades so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll survive a few weeks!",

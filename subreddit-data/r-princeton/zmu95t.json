    "postText": "The petition reads as follows, link below:  \nThe no overnight parking rule (2 am - 6 am) in Princeton is purely an inconvenience for locals, a burden for low-income residents, and a money grab by the city and its city council and should not be resumed.\n\nParking has not been an issue for residents since this ordinance was paused due to Covid-19.\u00a0 There is no justification or logic for the rule and its stringent restrictions beyond a way to funnel money into the city via tickets, parking permits, and forced utilization of the public parking garage.\n\nThis classist parking ordinance completely disregards Princeton's lower-income community members, who are less likely to have a driveway and more likely to have multiple working adults living in their household. The arbitrary restriction of \"one street parking pass per household\" is a blatant example of the ordinance's lack of consideration for these community members; by resuming the ordinance, the city council is enforcing this lack of consideration while showing they have none.\u00a0\n\nThere is no explanation for why 2 am - 6 am is a special time when people can not park on the street, and there is no explanation for why there is a one-per-household limit. This is clearly a revenue-generation move by the city council based on the backs of people who can afford the increased cost by it the least. They do not care if community members are inconvenienced or financially burdened by resuming this entirely unnecessary ordinance.\n\nPlease sign this petition if you believe that the overnight parking rule in Princeton should remain paused and eventually removed. It is a middle finger to community members who cannot afford a driveway, parking lot, or live in a household with one working adult.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n[https://chng.it/ZhfFV6bhCV](https://chng.it/ZhfFV6bhCV)",

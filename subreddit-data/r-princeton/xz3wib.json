    "postText": "Hi! I am a high school senior applying to Princeton in the next couple weeks. I have a 32 ACT and a 5.3 weighted (3.95 unweighted) GPA, and am 4th out of my class of 350 or 450 (public school). I am a white, gay, transgender male. I am from the midwest, so not in-state but still in the country. Should I send my ACT score when I apply or no? Thank you!",

For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019d check this out: [https://admission.princeton.edu/apply/admission-statistics](https://admission.princeton.edu/apply/admission-statistics). These are stats on last year\u2019s admitted students - the ACT data is saying that at least 75% of the class has an ACT score of 33 or better. Just some food for thought. There aren\u2019t any hard and fast rules about what works as far as I know.",

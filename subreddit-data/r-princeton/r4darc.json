I do worry though that as a researcher and not a student it might be hard to make friends and meet people.\n\nIf anyone has thoughts or advice about living there (particularly as a non-student or grad-student) I would be interested to hear it. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Firstly, I am a grad student here. I think that one thing to be aware of with Princeton is that the different categories of people on campus are very separate here, way more than at other schools. I can count on one hand the number of postdocs and undergrads that I regularly interact with, and they're all in my research building. They socialize us heavily amongst ourselves but there are very few mixed events.\n\nThere are some events that researchers attend; I see them at symposiums, departmental events, and happy hours. Most of the postdocs I know only hang out with other postdocs and some of the older GS.\n\nNew York and Philly are not far, but I think you are right that meeting people at the school is fairly limited as a non-student. This is sort of an \"adult life in general\" problem, but definitely exacerbated by how few people you will generally interact with here.\n\nOverall I would say that you can't rely on the school for your social life as an adult. That is something for the college kids to do.",

            "comment": "The social situation as a researcher at Princeton certainly can be challenging, but it can also be a pretty good if you are willing to put in a little effort (and don't mind driving). \n\nIf you are coming in as a post-doc there is a pretty active group/mailing-list that helps to connect people in the same situation. There are also numerous clubs and activities on campus that are open to staff and the community as well as to students, and these can be a great as a way to socialize (I have been involved in the Aikido, Swing Dancing and Rock Climbing clubs as a researcher and made some excellent friends).\n\nMore generally there is a lot going on in NJ generally, and of course NY and Philly are reasonably close. So as long as you are willing to drive a bit to go find stuff, there are a huge amount of opportunities. \n\nFor NY, there is  a direct bus and a direct train from Princeton, so it's fairly convenient to travel there. The biggest issue is that the last return tickets are pretty early at night (1am), so alot of the NY night life is rather inaccessible unless you drive at least part way. Princeton itself has no nightlife to speak of (at least that I was particularly interested in). \n\nFor Philly the public transportation is not very convenient, but parking is much more reasonable. Philly is really only a 45 min drive away.\n\nNote: everything is harder with covid. The on-campus clubs are really only just restarting. Looks like thing are slowly getting back to normal though (of course that could change again anytime).",

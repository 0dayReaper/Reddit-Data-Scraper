    "postText": "I am currently in 11 grade (or two years before leaving for college) and found my passion in astronomy and physics. I love Princeton's campus and have heard a lot of positive comments. One thing I am not so sure about is whether their astronomy and astrophysics programs are the ones for me or not. Can anyone with experience help me ?  \n\n\nThanks!",

So, it's been a while since I was a member of the department, but I have returned for reunions and visited Peyton Hall each time.\n\nThe department is widely regarded as one of the best in the country, and I'd agree with the assessment.  The astronomers in it span a wide range of interests, from observational work to theory to computational analysis.   I found all but one or two, over the years, to be very friendly and approachable.  It was easy to set up a time to chat.   The classwork will be tough, but you should be very well prepared for any graduate school.",

I don't have high hopes of getting accepted into Princeton but I'll do my best to learn as much physics and math as I can. I already have a passion for astronomy in astrophotography but that's not enough for me.",

    "postText": "Hey guys! I am applying to Princeton this year and a graded paper is required. I am an international student and I don't know what is a graded paper. From what I have read, I need to write a paper (assuming like a SAT passage) and let my teacher grade it. However, since school break has started I no longer can contact my English teacher. So I wanted to ask whether I can let it grade it by random teacher outside school. (feel free to correct me if I am wrong)",

Also, sometimes we used to debate but it was really rare. We wrote essays but it was something cliche and uninteresting most of the time, like how was your summer break and teachers didn't even grade it. It was just a way of getting us comfortable to learning after long vacation.",

Did you ever write a paper or essay for that class and was it graded?  There you go.  If not as a separate assignment, then did you have a test or exam for that class that involved an essay response?  You can use that!  My son who got in to Pton a few years ago used, if I remember correctly, an essay from a English test on Hamlet.  While it wasn't his most highly polished piece of writing, because of course there was no time for editing or revising, and it was written with his less-than-beautiful handwriting, his ideas were excellent and his teacher commented on his fresh insights.  Plus, considering it was written in the rush of test-taking, it was a solidly constructed essay.",

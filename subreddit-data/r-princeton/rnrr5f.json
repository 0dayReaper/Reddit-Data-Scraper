    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm a prospective applicant to a bunch of elite schools and I was wondering what you all think sets Princeton apart from its peer schools. Obviously, all top-whatever schools excel in academics, but what is Princeton the best at? What \"unique vibes\" does the college have? What made you choose it over your other options?\n\nThanks all!",

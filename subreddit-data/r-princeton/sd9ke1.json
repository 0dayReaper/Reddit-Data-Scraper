    "postText": "Hi, I am a graduate student in the Language Science Department at the University of California, Irvine. I am conducting an online research study that investigates language learning in bilinguals who are immersed in their nondominant language. I am specifically recruiting Chinese international students who are currently studying in the US and who have no formal knowledge of Spanish (for additional information about eligibility, see attached flyer).The study is conducted online and involves completing tasks on the computer during a zoom meeting. The computer tasks involve speaking in English, Mandarin, completing a survey about language experience, and also learning Spanish words and grammar. The experiment involves 2 experimental sessions. The first lasts 1 hour and the second approximately 45 minutes. Participants will be paid $15 per hour for a total of $30. For more information, see this flyer: [https://www.facebook.com/ucibmb/photos/a.128932202747611/128932049414293 ](https://www.facebook.com/ucibmb/photos/a.128932202747611/128932049414293).

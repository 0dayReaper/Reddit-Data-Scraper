    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming first-year and I was wondering which major I should go into. Originally I was set on Molecular Biology but after speaking to some people it seems that Chemical and Biological Engineering would be good if you\u2019re pre-pharmacy. I\u2019m wanting to attend pharmacy school and eventually become a research pharmacist, pharmacologist, or just a pharmacist working in a hospital. \n\nWhat makes me unsure is that I\u2019m not very strong in chemistry since I took it online, although it\u2019s an interesting subject. I\u2019ve also heard that the engineering program is very rigorous, so I don\u2019t know if I want to go through that if Molecular Biology would be easier and would get me into pharmacy school either way.\n\nI\u2019m also interested in pursuing a certificate/minor in Portuguese or Art History (if they end up offering it), so pursuing an AB might allow me more flexibility for that.",

            "comment": "Great question!\n\n1) It\u2019s great that you\u2019re already thinking about this, but you have some time to explore when you get here. Not a ton, of course, since CBE is one of the more \u201cinvolved\u201d majors, and you want to get going quickly, especially if you\u2019d like some room to pursue a certificate. The good thing is that MOL and CBE are mutually relevant to a degree in terms of course planning. This means you can parallel plan during your first two terms without contorting yourself *too* much. Are you bringing in any AP credit? The provisional table for 2027ers is up. \n\n2) Connect with the Center for Career Development and Health Professions Advising when you get here. They are magnificently helpful in helping you think through these questions.\n\n3) My impression is that MOL would be more than fine for pharm, unless you decided you wanted to do the synthetic chem side of pharm, in which case you\u2019d probably want CHM or CBE. And MOL would offer considerable more flexibility for pursuing non-major interests.\n\n4) Repeating 1) and adding that you will have ample opportunity to get robust advice from academic deans, faculty advisers, pre-professional advisers, peer advisers, etc., so for now, I\u2019d poke around the Undergraduate Announcement and look through the course offerings for the fall and bookmark what excites you the most.",

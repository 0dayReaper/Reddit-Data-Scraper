Website is super out of date and the FB hasn't posted in over a year. I'd love to be able to keep practicing signing, would appreciate any info on them.",

Some students in the class had ASL background and the course assumes no knowledge of ASL or Deaf culture, but it seemed like they also felt engaged by the course. Depending on your level of background knowledge it might not be the most valuable course to enroll in formally, but I would reach out to the professor with these questions!",

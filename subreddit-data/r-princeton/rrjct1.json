I would still remain at Princeton for the most day, just at night, I would have to drive back home. Does Princeton check if you are sleeping in your dorms?",

As for parking, I find that parking during the day (morning till midnight) there are plenty of \u201call-day\u201d street parking to take advantage of.  If you search up a Princeton parking map, these are designated in blue. Feel free to pm me if you have any other questions",

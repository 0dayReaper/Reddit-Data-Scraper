Oh, the hubris...\n\nIt's only been a couple weeks and my god, I swear I've been bitten more than in any other summer I can remember. I've gotten at least one bite while sitting *inside* Frist. My legs are a mess of healing bite spots. I sat outside for like 10 minutes just now to eat dinner and came back with 2 more bites.\n\nAlso my allergies are worse, but tbh that's quite possibly my dorm room's fault.\n\nTL;DR - send help, i'm itchy and physically miserable for a variety of reasons",

Then  alternate hydrocortisone cream and calamine lotion on the bites.",

Still don't enjoy getting bit, but they heal fast.\n\nThe ice also helps with any itching as the meds start to wear off.",

Very noticeable when we spend time out together, she's the mosquito magnet keeping everyone else safe.\n\nCould be diet as I really like garlic/onion stuff and she's a sugar/fruit lover... but I think it's probably more than that.",

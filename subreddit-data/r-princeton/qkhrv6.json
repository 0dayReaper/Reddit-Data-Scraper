It is kind of a pain and you might have to ask your teacher to give you something that conforms to the guidelines. This PDF or JPG will be uploaded separately in your Princeton applicant portal which will be given to you after you submit your main application.\n\nStep one is to find a decent English paper that you have already written that has already been graded by a teacher.\n\nStep two is turning that paper into the format that Princeton requires.\n\nStep three is uploading it to your Princeton applicant portal.",

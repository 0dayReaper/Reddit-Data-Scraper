    "postText": "Normally I would just email this question to the admissions team but seeing as how it's Christmas and I can't contact them, I've decided to ask you all.\n\n I have a choice between two graded papers to submit but they've both got slight problems when it comes to submitting them. The first paper I could submit is an analysis of some poem I did for English in my old school (in a different country) and I can't seem to find the actual paper. However, I do have photos of the paper alongside the teacher's comments, which clearly show there was nothing wrong with the essay, but the grade isn't actually visible in the photos, which is unhelpful, to say the least, since I managed to get a 100 in that and my teacher at the time had never given a full mark before. To be fair though, the teacher did write \"The Perfect Answer\" at the very end. The second paper is some philosophy thing I did this year and have saved as a doc. The teacher's comments and the grade I got are not shown on the doc but are available on our school portal. I'm guessing I'd have to attach a screenshot in this case. \n\nWhich of the two would you recommend I submit? Thanks for taking the time to read this and I'll gladly welcome any advice you can offer.",

Submit whichever one you think is a better exemplar of your writing and that best aligns with Princeton\u2019s stated criteria for the graded paper.",

The next year, both the sophomore Class of 2001 and the junior Class of 2000 ran the Olympics. It was a total shitshow and given the massive safety problems they called off the Nude Olympics for good.\n\nThis year the Class of 2000 will miss their 20th reunion. Next year they'll double up with the Class of 2001, again. Will it be a total shitshow? As a result will they cancel reunions forever??????? Only time will tell.",

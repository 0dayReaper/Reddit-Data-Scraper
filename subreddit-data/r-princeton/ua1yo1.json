    "postText": "Hi,\n\nFirst off, I just want to say that I'm incredibly lucky to have gotten into both schools and to be in this position. But right now, I'm having the hardest time deciding between the two schools. I'm thinking about going pre-med and pursuing a degree in the STEM field. Princeton's better for the program that I'm looking into, but I'm really worried about the grade deflation here. On the other hand, Penn has one of the best pre-med programs in the country. What do you guys think?",

I would directly contact students doing ur program to ask about their experience tho - that's what ultimately helped me choose",

Princeton's faculty in most departments are rated higher, and this could help if you take advantage of undergraduate research opportunities, which Princeton students are required to do.\n\nNormalized for size, Princeton has more graduates attending top medical schools, although this also has to do with self selection. Penn probably has more in absolute numbers because Penn has nearly twice as many undergrads (2400 vs 1300 per class).\n\nMedical school prestige doesn't really matter, at least not nearly as much as law school/MBA/PhD prestige in terms of career opportunities.\n\nI'm a Princeton grad doing my PhD at MIT.",

            "comment": "If this is a hard choice for you there must be things about both that you really love. It\u2019s so subjective. For me, this is just about the easiest choice I could imagine, because all of my interactions with Penn have been lousy and all my interactions with Princeton have been great so far. I also wouldn\u2019t want to live in Philadelphia (been there done that), and I think Princeton is lovely. So you see it\u2019s very subjective. If you are going just on reputation and prestige, Princeton wins by quite a ways, and that\u2019s saying something because Penn is obviously quite well regarded by everyone who will matter. If you\u2019re going by size, it depends what you like. If you\u2019re going by undergraduate vs graduate student focus, Princeton is much more the former than Penn. Nobody can decide this for you. Only you know what you like. Princeton and Penn are different enough that the choice should become clear to you pretty quickly. It\u2019s a good problem to have.",

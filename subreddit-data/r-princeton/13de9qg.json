    "postText": "I did the IB diploma program and I always hear mixed opinions about whether or not it prepares you for university. Does the rigor of IB courses compare to Princeton courses? Is the writing level similar? If not, did you have a difficult transition or would you say you were better off compared to non-IB students.",

            "comment": "I did IB in hs. It prepared me well in some courses like Physics (SL-&gt;PHY103) and not so well in others like writing sem (I did HL LangLit). I wasn\u2019t super behind in anything though. The transition was smooth for the most part - I\u2019d say I was around the same level of preparedness as my BSE peers. It also depends on your major/what HLs you took. For me, IB was more time consuming but Princeton is more rigorous and advanced.",

I did fine in writing sem, it just was different from hs. To be fair though, writing sem is a grind for most people anyway lol. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it, IB sets you up pretty well",

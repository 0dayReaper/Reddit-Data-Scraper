    "postText": "High school senior here! \n\nI know that I definitely want to major in COS, but am not sure which path to take. My family seems to think that the BSE degree is better/stronger/more 'prestigious'  in a sense, hence better for job opps, even though the COS reqs for both AB and BSE are the same. Personally, part of me is leaning towards AB because I heard that the math department at Princeton is super tough and physics itself is already pretty hard. Plus, I think I can place out of the language reqs with my native language, so that'll free up some space. Though I am not sure if I want to engage in a senior thesis (which I know is optional for BSE). \n\nIn this case, what advice do you have? Does the type of degree really matter/make a difference? Is senior thesis not as bad as I think it is? Why do most students choose to do COS BSE over AB?\n\nCould really appreciate any input! :)",

            "comment": "Here are some quick differences between the two as far as requirements:  \nAB:  \n2 literature, 1 history, 1 epistemology/cognition, 1 ethics/morality, 2 social analysis (economics, politics, etc.), 1 science with lab, 1 science with or without lab, 1 quantitative reasoning (hard to miss), senior thesis, an extra semester of junior independent work, a foreign language (which you already have)\n\nBSE:  \nmultivariable calculus, 2 semesters of physics, 1 semester of chemistry, 7 humanities divided among at least four of { literature, history, EC, EM, SA, foreign language }, 1 extra class\n\nAlso, if you've taken AP/IB physics or chemistry and done well, you can place out of the physics/chemistry, whereas you can't place out of anything else except math (through placement exam). I majored in BSE COS, and if I had majored in AB COS, it would've meant more independent work requirements, more strict humanities requirements, and having to take two science classes (which I did anyway) while not requiring multi. It was a pretty obvious choice for me.\n\nWhich COS you major in won't really affect you post-college, but whether you do independent work will matter if you want to go to grad school\u2014note that you can do independent work as either, but more is required for AB.\n\nSenior theses can be easy or hard depending on how much you put into it and who your advisor is. Some advisors won't really care and will give you an A with pretty minimal work. Others will make it like two or three classes for each semester of senior year.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions \ud83d\ude42 Princeton provides some great opportunities if you go for them.",

A large portion of AB people end up taking multi anyway, so the main difference ends up being AB has thesis/more distribution requirements while BSE has physics.",

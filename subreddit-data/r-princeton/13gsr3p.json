It's a laboratory so I know no open-toed shoes, but is business casual or smart casual? Suit and tie everyday? Not sure haha.\n\nI wanted to email and ask the people at the lab but I've asked so many questions and they are super busy right now with finals so I thought I'd come on here. Thanks in advance!",

Very view people will wear a tie or suit unless they are giving a presentation or having some sort of formal meeting. I suggest comming in the first day dressed up just a little, business casual, then see feel it out from there.",

Depends on your department though. \n\nPeople generally aren\u2019t too concerned about clothes as long as you aren\u2019t breaking anything",

There are also plenty of grad student events and you'll have opportunity to meet and make friends with other grad students.  The major issue is having social outlet beyond the grad students.  Depending on your personality, you may wish to expand your social circle.  No offense to grad students, but as a whole, they can be idiosyncratic.  \n\nPrinceton isn't a typical college town with restaurants and bars that cater to the students.  (The undergrads mainly stay on campus.)  You may find you have to go to Philadelphia, NY, or New Brunswick to get the experience of going to bars and concerts and being around other people in their 20's and 30's.",

However, it's important to note that this social scene I talk about is one of the major draws of Princeton as an institution. So though us not interfacing with it is to be expected, and isn't really a \"negative\" of the school, we miss out on the \"positive\" of it, if that makes any sense.\n\n&gt;Do you feel like you miss out on anything\n\nThe undergraduates have a world of events and clubs and stuff that I really, honestly, do not have time for. I think the general fact that the prestige of schools levels out more from undergrad to grad school means that grad school is less prestigious than undergrad. It's hard for me to quantify what opportunity you are particularly missing doing grad school here rather than undergrad because they're very different worlds, but both generally set you up pretty well for a good career path from what I've seen.\n\n&gt;In what way does admin \"care\" about you less\n\nAdmin keeps very close track of the undergraduates and the school manages them a lot more directly. They were locked down a lot more intensely during late covid while we were basically allowed to do whatever as long as we kept testing regularly.",

I noticed that grad students don\u2019t really hang in frist or murray-dodge. I wonder why that is since it seems pretty fun. I feel like there\u2019s always time for this kind of stuff, I was personally much more busy in undergrad taking so many classes. I\u2019m not an experimentalist though, so it could be different for people not doing pure theory. \nPrinceton seems to have a bunch of cool clubs but yea it would probably weird if a grad student joined because you\u2019d be the only one lol. Might be normal as a G1 but I\u2019m sure undergrads would find a 27 year old G5 creepy. \nWhat do you do outside of research if I may ask? Just chill in the dbar and on Nassau? That seems like it could get boring fast.. maybe groups of grad students hit up the on campus events and frist and Murray-dodge and Firestone library?",

We don't tend to go to the undergrad events because we don't really want to socialize with the undergrads (I have very little to talk about with teenagers, no offense to them) so we don't go, even if we're technically allowed to. I eat lunch in Frist sometimes with other grad students but don't \n\nMany of us also have already have developed an identity and associated hobbies for ourselves outside of school that takes up a lot of our time. I personally spend my free time playing competitive pokemon (hence my reddit history...lol), working out, and just having casual hangouts with my friends online or in-person. I hope to get back into DnD and cooking in the future.",

Academia is a caste system, not a meritocracy.\n\nMultiple [studies](https://larremorelab.github.io/us-faculty/hiring-flows/Academia/) have shown that there are incredibly rigid \u201cprestige hierarchies,\u201d in academia that just don\u2019t exist in undergrad. Fortunately for the people in this sub, Princeton is one of the \u201cupper caste\u201d schools. I think it\u2019s #3 for academia overall, if you\u2019re going off of the methodology of the paper I showed above. \n\nWhat does happen though, is that your undergrad degree matters less. For example, if you went to Princeton undergrad, but Rutgers for your PhD you would fall \u201clower\u201d in the academic prestige hierarchy than someone who did the opposite. It\u2019s a really stupid system and needs reform, but it\u2019s that way things currently work.\n\nThat means where you go to graduate school and it\u2019s perceived prestige will have a much greater impact on your career than your undergrad\u2014especially if you want to go into an academic career.\n\nBut yeah\u2014sorry for reviving this dead thread.",

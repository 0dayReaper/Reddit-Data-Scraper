Segal found a metaphor for the tragedy in the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac. In Segal\u2019s version, Abraham, dressed in contemporary clothing, looms over a college-aged Isaac, who is stripped of his shirt and bound with rope. Kent State University officials refused it, interpreting it as a politically volatile depiction of murder. According to Segal, however, this group misunderstood the memorial: the theme, in Segal\u2019s words, was 'the eternal conflict between adherence to an abstract set of principles versus the love of your own child.' Segal selected Princeton\u2019s site for the sculpture, near the University Chapel, to reinforce the work\u2019s biblical associations.\"",

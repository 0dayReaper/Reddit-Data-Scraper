August 25 looks right. If you do OA (I think there's more than just OA now, I remember there also being volunteer activities), that'll take up the entire previous week. I would encourage you to take advantage of these activities, it's a great way to get to know a few fellow freshman and upperclassmen (they lead the trips) before the chaotic floodgates of orientation.",

    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI'm a new pre-frosh BSE to Princeton, and I'm really excited to be here. I'm considering trying to place out of some chemistry courses because I've heard that they're a bit exacting, especially for newer students. \n\nMy question is: should I be trying to fulfill with chemistry requirements with AP credit/exam placement? Here are my thoughts: \n\n* PROS: I'll have more time for major-specific classes + interest classes + club activities\n* CONS: I'm interested in quantum ECE, and from my understanding chemistry eventually becomes quantum physics at some point--so maybe taking a rigorous chem class will help?\n\nThank you all for any advice! Can't wait for the fall.",

    "postText": "\nI know you guys have seen a thousand post like these so I apologize in advance. I was accepted in Penn-Wharton, Princeton, Columbia, and Cornell but I boiled my choices down to Wharton(finance concentration) Vs Princeton(economics). I plan on going into IB or consulting after my undergrad and I\u2019m looking to go where I\u2019d have access to the most opportunities. That being said I know that Wharton and Princeton are almost identical in terms of access to opportunities and no choice that I make would be wrong. I\u2019ve participated in Penn programs like PIF &amp; PEEP and talked with student leaders so I\u2019ve developed a strong connection to Penn. At the same time I\u2019ve fallen in love with Princeton as a school in terms of the focus on the undergrad and the strong alumni network. As of now the deciding factor is fin-aid and also the curriculum. I really love the curriculum at Wharton since I feel like it would prepare me for my future career but at the same time I understand the value of having a liberal arts education (Princeton). \n\nI\u2019m honestly super conflicted right now so I could really use some advice \ud83d\ude2d",

(I say with my own bias!).\n\nIt\u2019s great you have a sense of what you what to do post college, but I also have so many peers who came in determined to do subject A and shifted in their first few years to topic B. Princeton will give you that flexibility you deserve as a ~18 year old to think through what you really want to do and know you have an amazing path forward! And even if it is IB/consulting \u2014 Princeton will set you up great for that.",

                            "comment": "My reason being is that popular finance jobs are shifting towards trading/data science from investment banking. This mostly because traders get paid more and investment banking hours/WLB aren\u2019t worth it. \n\nTraders have to price assets so this usually involves machine learning and/or mathematical finance. ML, optimization, and stochastic processes aren\u2019t taught in wharton and not taught very much in princeton econ either. Princeton ORFE will prepare you better and not limit ur options. And i believe princeton\u2019s preparation in these topics is better than upenn. \n\nUpenn will be better for IB surely. But if you arent set on IB, and just interested in finance more generally, id choose princeton because the limiting factor here is ur preparation in more technical aspects.",

I\u2019d go with whichever schools give you the most aid and then if they are similar enough go with the vibe of the school. Cant speak about Princeton but Penn is a very intense but It works well for me",

You will be closer to Wall Street and internships and opportunities there.  Oh, and Princeton has Nobel laureates teaching econ.  I may be biased here (Princeton undergrad, Cornell Ph.D in humanities subjects) but I think Princeton beats every Ivy for its undergraduate education.  Go to Wharton for your MBA, but go to Princeton for your bachelor's degree.",

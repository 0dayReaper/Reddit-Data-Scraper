    "postText": "Several students have been charged with honor code violations in MAT 202 in the 2020 Spring semester at Princeton University. These charges come at a crucial time during which students are completing Dean\u2019s date assignments and studying for final exams. Under normal circumstances, this would be a very stressful situation, but considering the current state of affairs in the nation, it can be overwhelming for every student in the course.\n\nAn anonymous post was made on Tiger Confessions in which a person claiming to be a math PHD student and a TA for MAT 202 stated that the students had been baited by a professor. A quick look into Slader.com led to a contributor account with the user name \u201cArthur Dent.\u201d This particular account had posted only four solutions. All of the four solutions were for problems from the fifth edition of Linear Algebra with Applications by Otto Bretscher, the exact book used by MAT 202. Of those four solutions, one was in the assigned problems for problem set 9, and two were in the assigned problems from problem set 10. Specifically, 8.1 #23, 8.2 #37, and 8.2 #70. The time at which the solutions were posted was provided in a correspondence email with a content director at Slader after a request was made. The solutions were posted April of 2020. Problem set 9 was due April 27th. Problem set 10 was due the following week. Further inquiry to this account led to the Slader representative indicating that the email associated to the contributor account seemed to be fake. A separate correspondence with Slader stated \u201cOur moderators have confirmed that the answers given by that user were nonsense but written to look like they were reasonable.\u201d The solutions have since been removed, however screenshots were taken and have been linked to this post.\n\nI am a student at Princeton, and I made the poll in the MAT 202 GroupMe chat. Though I knew most students would be hesitant to participate, even a small amount of information would help shed light on what is going on. Currently, the poll stands at 9 students who claim their charges relate to problem #23 from section 8.1, one student claims their charge relates to problem #37 from section 8.2, and zero students have selected \u201cnone of the above.\u201d I am not writing this message to accuse any professor of entrapping their students, what I intend to do is bring to light some peculiar information about a situation which has already raised many red flags. Cheating is not right, it reflects poorly on one\u2019s character and negatively impacts peers who put forth an honest effort. But as detrimental as cheating may be, entrapment is just as harmful and just as dishonorable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://imgur.com/rcQetA2](https://imgur.com/rcQetA2)\n\n[https://imgur.com/JYfrbYj](https://imgur.com/JYfrbYj)\n\n[https://imgur.com/ho3b3o2](https://imgur.com/ho3b3o2)\n\n[https://imgur.com/JuiB8D6](https://imgur.com/JuiB8D6)\n\n[https://imgur.com/O41VNNH](https://imgur.com/O41VNNH)\n\n[https://imgur.com/bdFgUFg](https://imgur.com/ny37NwE)",

            "comment": "The fake answers are actually pretty interesting. Given the full context, they seem like exactly what you\u2019d expect, but imagine if you saw only those answers on Slader and you were trying to figure out why someone would post those in the first place. They\u2019re not just wrong, they\u2019ve clearly been deliberately written to resemble real answers if you\u2019re not paying attention or don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, but are very quickly identifiable as bullshit if you have half an idea of what\u2019s going on. \n\nIt would have been easy to write an entrapment answer for a question with a numerical result, which there are plenty of in 202 psets. This was the harder way of doing it. The writer also could have written an answer that was partially correct but laced with some kind of dead giveaway, but they didn't, even though that also would have been easier. It looks like some amount of real thought went into the creation of those fake answers. \n\nGiven that there are a small number of theorems to pick from for a given section, I\u2019d probably wager the writer even went out of their way to check that the theorem they referenced had nothing to do with what they were writing. I think it's very likely that the author only intended to catch a certain subset of cheaters, and they seem to have put a decent bit of effort into crafting an answer that would target them exactly. \n\nI should be working on my Dean's date assignments",

Also, TAs have to deal with a lot of paperwork with ODUS and it's a nightmare. We are too lazy to do this. I bet the professors provided keys saying \"to look for responses of these types of solutions and bring it to my immediate attention\". TAs can only report honor code violations not initiate a formal ODUS proceeding, but it's the professors that initiates the honor code violation in most cases, unless numerous student witnesses report the same honor code violation.",

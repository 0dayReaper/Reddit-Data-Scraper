    "postText": "When is Stephens Fitness Center the most *empty*? As a non-athlete and someone who isn\u2019t even close to being fit (let alone even looking their age), I find it really embarrassing to be \u201ccaught\u201d at the gym by other ppl who are twenty times more fit than I am. Hence, when is the fitness center the most empty? Are Friday nights (when everyone\u2019s out of the street) the most empty? Weekday mornings? Anyone have any experience of when it is the emptiest?",

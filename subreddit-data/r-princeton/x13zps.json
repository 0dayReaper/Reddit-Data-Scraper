    "postText": "i am a 2025 student who is going to become 2026 because i\u2019m taking a gap year this coming school year for mental health reasons. my freshman year was fucking disastrous to say the least. i ended the school year fully suicidal with crippling depression and an eating disorder and no friends because i decided to ghost everyone. my family is really worried for me, so they suggested i take a gap year between freshman and sophomore year essentially for me to figure my life out. i don\u2019t have any plans for my gap year and it\u2019s really stressing me out. i\u2019ve already declared a leave of absence and i\u2019m just freaking out about not having anything to do and i just feel stupid. at princeton, i drowned myself in work while starving myself in order to numb all of the pain, but now that i have nothing to do, i can\u2019t help but spiral about how this gap year is going to derail my career. i guess i\u2019m just looking for some reassurance tht this gap year is the right decision",

            "comment": "Hey there! I don\u2019t know your personal situation, and I\u2019m not a mental health expert, so take this all with a grain of salt \u2014 but it entirely sounds like the right and best decision based on what you shared. Take some time for yourself to get better and learn balance and what a journey mental health can be. \n\nIt will not delay your career, at all. I know a bunch of folks who have taken gap years after freshman year for a variety of reasons (some due to mental health, others for other reasons) and they are all flourishing and healthy now, years later. Also, your career is no where near as important as your health. Being safe and in an environment where you can work to be healthy is the MOST important thing you can do right now. No ifs ands or buts. You matter, your health matters, the rest is minor. I\u2019m glad your family is around and supportive of you.\n\nIf it is still stressing you, on a practical note\u2026 Employers and what not won\u2019t care, and lots may not even know depending on if they need to look at your transcript. On your resume alone they wouldn\u2019t have any real way of knowing as you don\u2019t have to list your start year / don\u2019t have to list high school etc. \n\nIn terms of what to \u201cdo\u201d \u2014 focus on your health. Sleep. Find a great therapist. Enjoy outdoors. Find some nice and not harmful ways to stay the right level of busy for your health - maybe develop a new hobby for fun that is relaxing and calming - knitting or painting or yoga or Lego\u2019s or long walks. Learn strategies to deal with stress or depression or any other thing you struggle with. \n\nYour life is so much more than a career. You are so much more. You are not stupid and nothing about this is stupid. \n\nSending you best wishes from a fellow \ud83d\udc05",

            "comment": "I slowly burned out throughout my time at Princeton. My grades slowly got worse and worse for the first three years. I failed a class first semester senior year and had to take 5 classes second semester. I ended up not going to class for 8 weeks, just eating and watching television. When I finally \"woke up\" I realized I was well and truly screwed. I ended up taking off the second semester retroactively and taking a year off.\n\nIt was the best thing that could have happened to me.\n\nI ended up doing data entry work most of the time I was off. I also managed to take a class at a local college to make up for the one I failed, thus allowing me to take 4 classes when I came back. My jobs were boring as hell, but had the advantage that when I walked out the door at the end of the day, the job didn't follow me. There were no papers, no homework. Just free time after work. It gave me an incredible opportunity to clear my head.\n\nWhen I went back to Princeton, I ended up taking an advanced math class along with my required classes (I was an MAE major). It was like the clouds had parted. I was finishing problem sets the day after they were assigned, not the day they were due. I had rediscovered the love of learning. I had a new appreciation for the ability to just be a student and not have to worry about everything else. My last semester was A+, A, A, B+, and the last was probably because my senior independent work was really only tangentially related to engineering.\n\nIt certainly did not derail my career. On the contrary, it probably saved it. I am now in my 26th year of teaching and I can say that it has been a satisfying career. Trust me, nobody hiring cares if you took a year off in college. My advice to people has generally been that if you think you need a gap year, you probably do.\n\nSo take care of yourself and do not worry that the gap year is going to screw things up, because not taking one certainly could.",

            "comment": "I'm a grad student here but I took a gap year partially for mental health in undergrad (I was hit by a car so I was forced to drop out for at least a term already, but it also sent me into deep depression). I just told employers/grad schools/etc afterwards that the gap year was for medical reasons. Nobody really will question you on it and if they do you don't have to elaborate, so no worries about the gap in schooling. \n\nI personally spent the gap year doing some work, which was definitely the right choice. It was less about concern for \"derailing my career\" and more about just having something to do though. I didn't rush into working in the gap, I took a month to just fully rest and went back into stuff slowly. \n\nYou aren't likely to \"figure your life out\" in a gap year; I think it is very helpful to just rest and take a break from the stress and pressures of school.\n\nI know everyone is different so my experience and strategy with it isn't universal but just thought it may be useful to hear the perspective of someone who was in a similar boat.",

            "comment": "life is so long. I went through a similar situation when I attended Pomona College for undergrad.\n\nyear after year we learn about patience and how to truly slow slow down. Just get a job for a while- anything easy and with people interaction. If you can save up enough to travel thats great. Just learn to be with yourself, travel can be wonderful for that. Do a long trek maybe.\n\nWith enough time, space and peace, especially peace, youll understand why your mental and emotional programming of Survival through fear/judgement is occurring and what to do about it. Stress is programmed response, in my experience it is possible to deprogram it especially with through whittle self judgement.",

            "comment": "Hi\u2014\n\nStruggled with Mental Health a lot through my time at Princeton. Started medication in senior year and it was a tremendous boon to me. I had energy and focus again. Also got lots of sun and vitamin D supplements which helped a lot.\n\nTwo big things to add were that my residential college dean was incredibly understanding and helpful. They spoke to all of my professors regularly to make sure I got through and succeeded. I\u2019d recommend being in contact with yours periodically throughout your time at Princeton.\n\nSecond, I wish that I had taken the time off to do a gap year. I was very, very sad during COVID and I stuck to my guns and almost ended up failing out anyway. Gap year is the right call\u2014 the Princeton insurance can cover therapy for you if you have it. I survived Princeton and got a good job and have found happiness on the other side. You can, and will too. My PMs are always open.",

One suggestion is WWOOF \u2014 basically you can travel anywhere in the world and work on an organic farm with other people your age in exchange for housing and food. And you\u2019re left with lots of time each day to explore. I\u2019m going to do it at some point this year. You could also try doing NOLS in the spring depending on how much money you or your parents are willing to spend.",

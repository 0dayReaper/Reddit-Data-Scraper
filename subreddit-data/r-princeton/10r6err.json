Think about why you love literature and think about things you can do to reflect that interest. \n\nLast weekend, I interviewed a Pton candidate who wants to be a psychiatrist. She\u2019s also an artist and her senior year AP project is a series of paintings reflecting what mental illness looks like from different perspectives. I thought this was an outstanding combination of interests and skill sets. I gave her a top rated recommendation.",

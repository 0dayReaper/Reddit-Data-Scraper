I was wondering if any Computer Scientists / Mathematicians could give me some insight into what a regular day at Princeton looks like for them and how it might differ to Oxford. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Hi, congrats! I studied ORFE at Princeton (Class of 2018) and went on to do an MSc in CS at Oxford (+ I spent my junior spring semester at Oxford).\n\nThe big thing I\u2019d say is that undergraduate life at Princeton is very structured compared to undergraduate life at Oxford. At Princeton you\u2019ll have multiple classes a day, some of which will be large lectures. At Oxford, you\u2019ll have a handful of classes a week and they will be very small in size (like, usually 2-3 people with an instructor). At Princeton, you\u2019ll constantly be getting graded with homework, midterms, etc whereas at Oxford the only evaluations that really matter will happen at the end of the year (not counting end of term collections). At Princeton, you\u2019ll take five classes every semester, and they\u2019ll include not only classes relevant to your major, but also distribution requirements. You\u2019ll also (probably) be expected to do a senior thesis. At Oxford, you\u2019ll take two classes most trimesters and they\u2019ll all be directly related to your topic of study.\n\nBasically, Oxford will give you lots of work but lots of freedom in how you handle it, and will be single-minded in your topic of study. Princeton will give you lots of work, but its structure will force you to spread out your learning in terms of time and also discipline via distribution requirements. Both CS programs can be quite theoretical, but I found Princeton to have more practical coding assignments than Oxford.\n\nOxford\u2019s college life is much better than Princeton\u2019s residential college system imo, and Oxford as a city is much livelier than Princeton (and well connected to London). On the other hand, Princeton is a secluded place to study and take in every aspect of college life, while still having great access to NYC. Also, most people enjoy eating clubs, which compensate for Oxford\u2019s colleges a bit.\n\nIdk what your financial situation is, but unless A) you\u2019re paying full price no matter what or B) you got really, really lucky and got a scholarship at Oxford, Princeton will probably be way cheaper. If you are paying full price, this probably flips though, as Oxford\u2019s only three years and college costs in the UK are a little lower.\n\nI\u2019m kind of rambling, but having spent a lot of time at both of these (great!) institutions, I have lots of thoughts. I don\u2019t think you can go wrong either way though. Happy to answer any specific questions you have in this thread or via PM.\n\nAlso, as a side note, there are lots of exchange programs between the two schools, so whichever one you pick you\u2019ll probably be able to check the other out during your undergrad!",

Plus, I personally prefer the US education system with minors (certificates at Princeton) and the liberal arts curriculum allowing flexibility to explore other disciplines. I'm CO2026 too and will possibly be doing CS, hope to see you on campus! \n\nAlso, I feel oxford is just way too small in terms of sheer size for a good experience (the fact there are so many colleges means there will be only around 3-4 other ppl from your course staying with you, just something to consider)",

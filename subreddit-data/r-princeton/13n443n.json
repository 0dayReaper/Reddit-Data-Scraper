Does anyone know any professors willing to take in high schoolers to work with them? In addition, if I cold email professors, does anyone have any tips like who to email and how to do it?",

I'd recommend also looking into programs at other nearby schools, like these at Rutgers: [https://aresty.rutgers.edu/resources/other-programs/research-programs-rutgers-research-for-high-school-students](https://aresty.rutgers.edu/resources/other-programs/research-programs-rutgers-research-for-high-school-students) and apply to a bunch next year. Cold emailing as a high schooler has a pretty abysmal success rate.",

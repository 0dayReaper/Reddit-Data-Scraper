    "postText": "I'm looking to apply to Princeton's MPA program for next year Fall, but cannot make up my mind on which field to pursue. I'm torn between Field II: International Development and Field IV: Economics and Public Policy. \n\nFor context, I'm currently a development economist with the government of a developing country. I've been in the public service for two years and have my BSc in IR with a concentration in Economic Development from a US university. \n\nI'm looking for a program that's going to enhance my career prospects (such as working for an international agency like The World Bank or the UN). My job is a common platform for those workplaces as I already come in contact with these institutions often. I'm considering Field II because the content is strongly related to the work I already do and it would be useful to build upon, but I think Field IV will build the quantitative background I need to advance and looks better on paper. \n\nI'm not sure how flexible the fields are so that I could possibly tailor the courses I take to incorporate both, but I would still need to indicate one as my primary field of study and that's where I'm still not sure yet! \n\nAny help is appreciated :)",

            "comment": "You can focus field IV to international development and get the best of both ID and Quant focus. As an economist you will have the quant skills you for Field IV. Also, MPA students can switch fields in the first year. It happens all the time. If you get in and don\u2019t like field IV, you switch.",

            "comment": "Hey! I had the exact same dilemma as you this fall. The good news is, you don\u2019t declare your field anywhere until the very end of the first year when you are taking the Qualifying Exam 1. So you will have plenty of time to think. \nWhen I started the MPA, I was leaning more towards Field IV to build a strong quant background. However, now I realize that Field II is better because I can still take all the quant-heavy courses I want and not be restricted to just Econ courses all the time. If you go with Field IV, the course selection options (in my opinion) are more restrictive. \nAlso, don\u2019t overthink about fields too much. Honestly, it is not even mentioned in your diploma so just study what you want to study.",

    "postText": "Hello Princeton university goers. This is an odd request, but I have been searching the internet for months for an archive of a specific Korean television show and found that Princeton has an archive of the channel I'm looking for:  \n[https://library.princeton.edu/news/eastasian/2018-10-08/mbc-archive-korean-television-archive](https://library.princeton.edu/news/eastasian/2018-10-08/mbc-archive-korean-television-archive)\n\nIf anyone is willing to download and send the files for the 500th episode of the TV show Wednesday Art Stage (\uc218\uc694\uc608\uc220\ubb34\ub300) I would be extraordinarily grateful. If there is a better place to ask for this, please point me in that direction.",

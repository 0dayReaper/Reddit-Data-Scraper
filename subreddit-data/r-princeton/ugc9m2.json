    "postText": "Hey y'all! I'll be starting my freshman year at Princeton this coming August (Go Tigers!), and I'd like to keep my cat, if at all possible. Both my parents will be moving to China after I settle into the dorms, so my cat's kinda my emotional support line.\n\nI considered having her stay at a pet hotel, but I feel like that wouldn't be super comfy for her, and I'm not sure if any freshman dorms allow pets. Would the best option be to find someone nearby to take care of her for the first two years before I move out of the dorms, or are there other options?",

            "comment": "Only way to keep a cat in the dorms is if you get paperwork declaring it an emotional support animal, but that might require actual attestation from a therapist. Dunno about pet hotels or any other options like that, but it seems like it would be tough and expensive - it\u2019d be easiest to have your parents take the cat and just visit it when you visit your parents imo.",

This may be difficult, and I've heard that they've rejected certain applications. BUt not sure because I know quite a few people who approved\n\n\\-Find a family friend to take care of her for two years \n\n\\-Bring her sophomore year and spend next year getting approval for an emotional support animal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso while some people are very allergic to cats, it doesn't become an issue unless you room with them. I have a cat on campus and it's been fine (note: I also have a single dorm so no roommates)",

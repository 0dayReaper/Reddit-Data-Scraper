    "postText": "WHY? Everywhere I look its just hot girl after hot girl after hot girl. In my classes: hot girls. In the library: hot girls. In the dining halls: hot girls. How can I focus among all these hot girls? They're everywhere except my dorm! I can't even leave my own dorm anymore without my eyes being berated by female beauty. How do you other male specimen out there function with all these hot girls running wild? I came to Princeton because everyone told me the girls here were ugly and I could finally focus on my studies. Jokes on me I guess! The only thing I'm studying now is the perfect figure of the girl sitting across from me right now.

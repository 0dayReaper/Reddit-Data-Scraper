    "postText": "Hello, I am a graduate student who will be starting at Princeton this Summer. I have been diagnosed with glaucoma and require regular check-ups with a specialist. As an international student, I am unfamiliar with the US medical system, and my attempts to find a glaucoma specialist near the university have been unsuccessful. I recently contacted the UHS team for assistance, but their response was not very helpful.\n\nIf anyone at Princeton has experience with glaucoma care or knows of a reputable specialist near the university, I would greatly appreciate any advice or recommendations. Thank you in advance for your help!",

Use the Aetna In-Network Provider Directory to search for ophthalmologists who specialize in glaucoma.  You definitely want to make sure you choose a provider who is in-network.  Then, you might start looking at proximity to campus and online reviews.  If you aren't satisfied with the first couple appointments, you shouldn't hesitate to switch doctors.",

They were the lowest ranked \u201cseed\u201d in their group (No. 15) and defeated the No 2 ranked team (U of Arizona), making them only the 11th 15-seed to defeat a No. 2 in tournament history. When this tournament comes around each year, people often fill out \u201cbrackets\u201d making their predictions for how the tournament will play out. It starts with 64 teams competing and each round narrows the pool by half until the final match for the championship. Few people would have predicted Princeton to have won their first game given the historical odds against such a result. But truly loyal Princeton fans might have picked them based on school pride or die hard belief! I posed the question because I wanted to see who among us had enough Orange and Black flowing in our veins to pick Princeton for the win despite the odds!",

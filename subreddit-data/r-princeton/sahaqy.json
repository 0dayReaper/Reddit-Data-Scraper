    "postText": "Hello! I'm going to have an internship at the Forrestal Campus this upcoming summer and I was wondering what the renting situation in the area was like. I will probably be bringing my car so a short drive like \\~15 minutes is fine with me, and having free parking would be ideal (so subleasing at a house would be great). I would prefer to live somewhere already furnished. What is the best place to look for housing? I saw the Facebook housing group, is there anywhere else people tend to post? What does the rent cost in the area generally look like? Any other tips anyone has to find somewhere cheap but safe? Thanks!",

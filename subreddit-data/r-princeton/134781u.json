    "postText": "Hello! I am currently down to the final hours till college decision day, and I was hoping if anyone could help me in this decision. I am interested in engineering, although undecided field. I am aware academics are very similar so I was hoping for help in other aspects of life, like social environment. One of my main concerns at princeton is the academic rigor, especially for BSE. While they have rescinded their policy of grade deflation, I have heard grading can be much rougher than peer institutions, which is especially troublesome since I have plans for graduate schools. On this same note, I am curious if princeton students are generally happy, with the potential for symptoms of stress to be compounded by seasonal depression. One of the main things that has drawn me to princeton is the community, especially with the residential college system. I hope this post does not come off as pretentious as I would appreciate any guidance about princeton, whether pros or cons.",

My little brother had the same but w MIT\u2014he chose Princeton and is probably going to do something on an international/social change level when he finishes his studies. Two examples of people with very different paths, that I think really were influenced by the schools they went to. I think if my brother chose MIT he would prob have sold out and become a quant or something but I\u2019m super happy to see that he\u2019s following a different and more meaningful passion to him at Princeton. My best friend chose Stanford I think mainly bc she felt that she\u2019d be happier w the culture/env at Stanford and she came out of it with that west coast appetite of \u201cI could never work for somebody else, only myself\u201d and she acted upon it. \n\nYour plans for post undergrad will / might change. Everyone comes into school thinking they know what they want and then they learn about something else that\u2019s cool and opens their minds and things change. I say be open to that!!! And even if you\u2019re the kind of person that is deadset on their well laid out plan, maybe you\u2019ll learn different things along the way that\u2019ll add color to what you want to do w in grad school and beyond. All this is just to say, I think you are focusing on the wrong things (grades, stress can be possible at both places. Maybe seasonal depression less so in Palo Alto but hey, I like snow!). I think you should instead focus on which place you\u2019d value the community/people/experiences more. In my personal experience, I notice that my Princeton friends are very close w their college friends and involved w alumni/use their connections regularly. Take that w a grain of salt, but just what I\u2019ve noticed and what I value.",

Grad school AO\u2019s know this though and if anything would be comparing your application to applicants from Princeton from that year and years prior. \n\nIf you take a look at this [map of med school acceptees](https://hpa.princeton.edu/news/2022-map-medical-school-acceptances), you\u2019ll see that pre med\u2019s here have very few problems getting into top grad school programs. \n\nHonestly, you can\u2019t go wrong choosing either school. I would choose based on where you believe you fit better. Princeton and Palo Alto are two very different environments (both weather-wise and otherwise) and the school cultures themselves are very different. Just know that there really is no \u201cwrong\u201d decision here anyway.",

Depending on your weather preferences, the cloudy winter days in Palo Alto can be depressing as hell so the weather question is not that straightforward.\n\nStanford has a lot of big important graduate schools. Indeed, a lot of their fame comes from alums of those graduate schools, not their undergrads. While most of Princeton\u2019s grad programs are also extremely good, not having the professional schools makes so much more room for undergrads.\n\nYour focus on GPA and such suggests that you don\u2019t fully appreciate all that a college experience can be about. It\u2019s so much more than your classes and grades. And you\u2019ll get so much of that at Princeton.",

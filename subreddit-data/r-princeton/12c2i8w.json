I'm looking for a current Princeton student to help me with the Princeton application process, if anyone has done something like this please reach out to me!\n\nAlso (I'm sure some of you have done this before), I'm looking for something cool to do this summer in terms of research. If anyone here has connections to professors/research centers or is working on a cool project at Princeton - I would love to get in touch with you!\n\nPM me if you are willing to help me with this or have any questions!",

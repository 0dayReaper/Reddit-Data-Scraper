            "comment": "Some useful personal information to contextualize my perspective as ymmv: I am a straight white male, I came from an upper-middle-class home but we were certainly not rich and while I grew up comfortably, money was often a stressful conversation in my home. I grew up on the West Coast so the elite East Coast culture of Princeton was a bit of a shock but I adjusted. I was also a student-athlete at Princeton.\n\nOut of all of my high school friends, I easily had the best college experience. I had a lot of fun, met the most incredible people I could ever imagine meeting, and found the academic experience to be deeply rewarding. Princeton is unique in so many ways which serves to bond those who attend. As a result, you will find that the alumni community is engaged and enthusiastic. Princeton is the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nI could spend a long time on all the things that make Princeton 'excellent' but you are already informed about those things and lots of colleges are 'excellent'. Princeton is not perfect for everyone and there are a lot of personal considerations to be made around what is important to you, including location, majors, community structure, etc. Some people surely did not enjoy their experience as much as I did, but many many people did and are passionate Princeton alumni for the rest of their lives.\n\nGoing to Princeton was the greatest thing that ever happened to me. If you are deciding between Princeton and another school, you likely have another excellent option but I rarely meet people who are as enthusiastic about their undergraduate experience as me. Even though I had gripes about the school while I was there, I continue to appreciate the experience more and more as time goes by.\n\nI recommend Princeton to anyone who is considering attending. I miss it all the time.",

            "comment": "When I was deciding on colleges in high school, I ultimately chose Princeton because it felt like the most well-rounded university out there. I was honestly pretty undecided in high school, and I liked the idea that no matter what I would want to pursue in the future, Princeton would give me a top-notch opportunity to follow that path.\n\nNow that I'm about to finish my junior year, I can say with confidence that high-school-me was right ;) The opportunities and amount of support feel unparallelled compared to other schools. The \"undergraduate focus\" is real. And this is coming from someone who struggles to fit in with the Princeton culture and generally feels like an outcast. There are a lot of things I dislike about the university, but the bottom line is I'm getting an amazing education and am basically getting money thrown at me to pursue my passions. So I think it's ultimately a pretty safe choice of university",

I spent a summer in Germany on the Deutsche Sommer-ArbeitsProgramm, which was great.   I spent a year abroad in Italy on a Rotary Scholarship, so did not miss out on having a \"year abroad\" experience; I just did not have it as an undergrad at Princeton.  Honestly, I was perfectly happy to take a breather three years in to grad school at Cornell to spend a year at the University of Florence.  I would not have wanted to interrupt  my Princeton undergrad experience with a semester or year abroad though--I loved being there that much!",

The academics are excellent. I majored in English and my brother majored in math--we both went to other Ivies for our Ph.D.s and are now tenured professors at liberal-arts oriented universities on the East Coast.\n\n2.  The campus is breathtakingly beautiful: Prospect Garden in spring.  The Chapel.  Blair Arch. East Pyne Hall.  Chancellor Green.  Need I say more?  Go visit if you haven't.\n\n3. Living and eating experience: My residential College experience (Mathey) was excellent and I got to live in gorgeous dorms with wisteria hanging off of them.  I had a great eating club experience at Quadrangle. Excellent food and excellent folks--I am in contact with my eating club friends and my roommates from all four years by social media and e-mail just about every day.\n\n4.  Amazing extracurriculars:  I was a campus stringer for a lot of newspapers in NJ and NY through the University Press Club and got paid to write. I did not end up becoming a journalist, but it was a great work experience and helped me land summer jobs and an internship.\n\n5. Intermurals/athletics--I am not in the least athletic, but played on a whole bunch of intermural teams for my college and club: soccer, field hockey, ice hockey. Lots of fun and great exercise.  And hey, if you like basketball, Princeton just had a team do really well in March Madness this year!\n\n6.  Reunions.  This should probably be #1, because it is what I come back for, year after year.  The school spirit at Princeton is amazing.  We love the place and really do think it's the \"best damn place of all\" as one of our songs says.  I go back nearly every year to see my friends go to lectures, and drink and dance.  It's an orange and black baccanalian extravaganza that you have to see to believe.  I have been to other university reunions where I went to grad school and where my husband went.  Believe me, nobody does it better!  Here are the Nassoons to tell you why we go back:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFATFC6qjtE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFATFC6qjtE)",

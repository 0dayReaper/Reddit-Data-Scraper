I want to be among them one day, and it\u2019s clear that through Princeton I could be.\n\nKnow your reason.",

We don\u2019t care at all about your grades or your test scores. Princeton uses alumni interviews to try to get a true, human perspective on the applicants.\n\nI ask applicants about what they do with their friends, what books they\u2019ve read, whether they get along with their siblings \u2026 anything to really help get a picture of how the applicant would fit into college life. If you are an artist or write poetry, for example, you could bring it to share. \n\nYou also need to be prepared to talk specifically about why you are interested in Princeton. Only maybe one out of five applicants I interview has an answer that shows a real knowledge about the university. Maybe talk about the work of a specific professor or a class you find really interesting. Or think of something that distinguishes Princeton from other top tier schools - just to make clear you find it a unique opportunity compared to other ivies. \n\nWe also love to answer questions. We volunteer to interview because we loved going to Princeton. You might ask why we chose Princeton or what we liked about it. My favorite question was what I liked most about Princeton as a student compared to what I like most about it now. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask your interviewer to address what you might worry are some of the downsides of Princeton. I always think that shows a deeper understanding of the school.",

Everyone who gets in is smart. Princeton truly tries to craft a class of unique personalities. Use your time to talk about your uniqueness, not about your IB test scores or the national honors society or any generic smart kid stuff. Focus on lessons you\u2019ve learned and obstacles you\u2019ve overcome - reasons why other students would benefit from having a class with you. \n\nOther than that, I\u2019ve been put off by applicants who have spoken negatively about their classmates. (Sort of like, \u201cIt is so hard to be so smart in a world of dumsdums.\u201d) I\u2019ve been put off by applicants who clearly aren\u2019t being honest.

Also, make sure if you\u2019re asked to introduce yourself, you hit a few points that you\u2019d be happy elaborating on. They will likely follow up on your response to that question. I was also asked about my favorite subject - I would answer the subject you\u2019re majoring in, and then continue talking about your relevant projects in that area. Also think of how your friends would describe you. And I was also asked at the end if there was anything else I\u2019d like admissions to know - I talked about my career goals, since I hadn\u2019t mentioned that yet. When the interview is over, I\u2019d send a thank you email with your resume attached for reference. Good luck!",

I\u2019d suggest first taking a deep breath and understanding that this interview is meant solely for the admissions office to learn more about your character. I would then prepare responses to the following questions:\n\n1. Why [insert major]\n-don\u2019t get too technical and try to be relatable\n2. Why princeton \n-I suggest breaking it down to academics, EC\u2019s, + something else like research/community\n3. Tell me about yourself - I like the past, present, future model to answer this question but add some spice\n4. Tell me about your hs\n-positives and negatives (what you\u2019d change)\n5. Tell me about your proudest accomplishment \n-I would not try to sound bragging here, rather something somewhat mall and sweet\n6. What questions do you have for me\n-this is you last chance to show your genuine interest! Have a couple good questions prepared. \n\nFinally, be yourself!",

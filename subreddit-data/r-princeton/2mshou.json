    "postText": "A scavenger hunt! Congratulations Princeton, New Jersey! Between 4:30pm &amp; 5:30pm I'll be hiding a very special surprise on behalf of Reddit Secret Santa! You can read about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2mrwyt/finders_keepers_losers_weepers_the_hunt_starts_now/)\n\nI can tell from other posts that you are all super excited to get started! But be patient! It's gonna be fun!\n\nEdit: I realize this is the university sub, but it will be just outside of campus, in the business district area!\n\nPlease be patient, I got stuck at work a little longer so I bumped the time I will be hiding the surprise. I'm so sorry.\n\nCLUES!!! I'd like to make a quick shout out to /u/AmphibiousMeatloaf for helping me with the clues!\n\nThis is OFF campus, so it is on public property!\n\n1) Children are often brought here by their mothers,\nTo explore and learn about the worlds of others.\n\n2) When trying to do research before the age of reddit, this is the place you'd go to get it.\n\n3) But where within these walls will you find your treasure?  Think of the things reddit loves in a picture.\n\n4) 636.809 Myr\n\n\nFOUND! [Winner](http://www.imgur.com/6ezhRkw.jpeg) /u/benarus",

I think it\u2019s harder to get a good GPA at Princeton than at the typical state school (deflation + grading is curved, and the student body at Princeton is in general more able and motivated than at a state school), so a 3.7 at Princeton should hold more weight than a 3.7 at a typical state university for grad school admissions. Was I being pretentious, like most commenters suggested? Is my claim unreasonable?",

So what you said wasn\u2019t technically wrong it\u2019s just the way you said it almost as if to assert that we are \u201cworse off\u201d for going to Princeton comes off as pretentious. Similar to how rich ppl will complain about having to pay more taxes",

Like what was your goal in posting that, what information were you wanting people to tell you? Were you wanting to ask if grad schools/employers take school ranking into account with regards to GPA? You could have literally just asked that, explained Princeton\u2019s grading system, and asked for advice in handling the situation. You did none of that in the post and it looks like you literally just went on that forum to vent about a \u201cproblem\u201d that the majority of people on that sub can\u2019t relate to, and you managed to also put those people down in doing that. \n\nYou can be frustrated without putting other people down. Also I don\u2019t understand why you are assuming state schools\u2019 GPA are less impressive\u2014haven\u2019t you ever heard of UC Berkeley? I\u2019d argue there\u2019s much more rigorous standards at the UCs than at Princeton (I came from a UC myself), and we also don\u2019t have the benefit of small class sizes and attentive faculty.  The fact you chose to specifically put down public universities makes your post also come off as incredibly classist, is the fact that those GPAs come from a school with more working class people make it inherently less impressive? \n\nSo yeah, you sounded pretentious\u2014you didn\u2019t ask for any specific advice or information from people on that forum, you made yourself seem like a \u201cvictim\u201d when really you were just putting other people down, and also in a classist manner. Applying for grad school is incredibly stressful, I can empathize with that, but remember the \u201cbad guys\u201d are not working class students who go to a public university.",

I don't care about whether I see proof of that. But the thesis statement of your post, that a 3.7 from Princeton should \"count more\" for grad admissions than a 3.7 from a \"typical state school,\" just comes off as you bragging that you go to Princeton. The post implies that you see Princeton as inherently superior and state schools as inherently inferior, based purely on prestige and your perception of academic difficulty. \n\nAnd to top it all off, you posted this to A2C, where many people want very badly to attend an Ivy+ school but will be attending their in-state option instead.

Not sure about Stanford, but Princeton cares about \"recommendations and research\", at least in the programs I'm familiar with. Recommendations from well-known scientists and good research are easiest to attain at prestigious schools. If you look at Stanford BioE PhD most of the students are T20 undergrads as well. \n\n&gt;Princeton CS does filter students\n\nI think you misunderstand, my undergrad actually required you to apply to your major as if you were applying to a school.

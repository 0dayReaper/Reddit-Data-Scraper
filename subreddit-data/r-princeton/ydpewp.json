The only difference is which courses are *required* to take, as well as ABs writing junior papers and a senior thesis.\n\nABs have a language requirement as well as other liberal arts distribution reqs\nBSE has required physics Chem and Math\n\nHowever, this is not to say that BSE = STEM. In fact, Physics and math are both AB, and COS has the AB option. \n\nFor specific major reqs and details it\u2019s all on the Princeton website",

The differences all come down to the overarching degree requirements: \n\n* 1 semester of independent work (BSE) versus 4 (AB)\n* BSE math requirements (both of multivariable calculus and linear algebra) versus AB COS requirement (linear algebra only)\n* BSE science requirements (one semester of chemistry and two of physics) versus the AB requirement of 1 lab science and one other SEL/SEN designated course.\n* BSE breadth requirements (7 courses across at least 4 of 8 areas) versus AB general education requirements (11 courses specifically doled out across 9 areas, including the 2 science courses already listed above)\n* Foreign language requirement (AB has one, BSE doesn't)\n* 36 courses (BSE) vs 31 (AB), though the difference isn't as large as it seems at first since AB IW doesn't count as a course and BSE IW does.",

Note, too, that the certificate programs are going to be metamorphosing into minors, which *could* change how readily they\u2019re taken on alongside various concentrations (which will be renamed majors at some point soonish).\n\nEdit: concentrations &gt; certificates.",

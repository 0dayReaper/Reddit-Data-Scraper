They probably scored extremely high or sometimes perfect in all their math/physics tests. If you don't do well enough consistently, you might get kicked out of the program.\n\nMeanwhile if you go in for debating, public speaking, and drama, you'll be the \"national\" level student that others will have to compete against. Then you can probably pick up physics on the side for fun and see if you want to delve deeper into it.",

Look up a list of majors at princeton. I'm assuming you want to go to the liberal arts college. That's where 90% of students go. It includes anything from english to physics.",

But someone who fails or comes close to failing a lot of classes in the major should re-evaluate the choice of major on their own (or with an advisor).  \n\nAnd someone who isn't very good at math and physics is not going to enjoy being a physics major at Princeton.",

            "comment": "I think you should try to differentiate whether you like the *idea* of doing physics or *talking about* physics versus *actually doing* physics, which for most courses is just more and more calculus and differential equations. I mean, at a certain point, you get enjoyment over things you're good at, and if you don't do well in classes, it just won't be fun.\n\nThat being said, it's not impossible. I am hardly the top of my class in physics exams, but I like to think I have a better knack for coming up with research ideas, writing grants, and executing projects. Your exams are hardly the end all, be all. \n\nIf you know you really want to do real physics research as a career, then just do physics, and you don't need to worry too much about your relative standing. But by the time you make it past all the exams and into research, you probs won't need someone on reddit to give advice on whether you should pursue this or not :)",

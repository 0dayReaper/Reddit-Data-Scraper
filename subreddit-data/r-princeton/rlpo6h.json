If you get into Princeton, you don't have to apply to get into the CS program.\n\nI wanted a well-rounded school with a solid international reputation. I also wanted a school with strong STEM offerings. There are many good schools like that, but Princeton, UChicago, Stanford, and Harvard were the best four I found.\n\nI didn't like Harvard's architecture. Something felt off about Stanford. I applied to Princeton and got in early, so I went with that.",

            "comment": "The phrase I've heard around campus a couple times is that we study hard and play hard. Like there's a certain level of rigor that can be intimidating, but you realize everyone is going through it as well. People are quite collaborative (you essentially need to be in STEM here). Princeton and the town can be smaller than expected, but there's still something always going on with some club or university event. The town can provide the essentials, and that's about it (besides the Garden Theater or the restaurants). As for grade deflation, we still have the lowest GPA in the Ivy League, but it won't seriously disadvantage you because, well, it's Princeton. Campus recruiters and law/grad schools are generally aware of the level we're held to. Overall, recommend becoming a tiger; it's a great time even if it can be tough.",

(for STEM classes, at least)\n\nThe place is beautiful minus the construction. More specialty stores have been popping up on our main street so it's not as bleak (there's an Asian mart now).",

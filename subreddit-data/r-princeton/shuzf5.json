    "postText": "Hi, I am an aspiring physics major who's considering whether Princeton would be a good fit for me. To any current/ past Princetonians (or anyone else who can answer one or more of the following questions)\u2014 what made you choose Princeton? What's different about Princeton physics (if you happen to know)? Do you like Princeton right now (why/why not)?\n\n*Edit:* I just realized this seems like an essay request XD. You don't have to answer all the ones. At least one would be helpful. I wanted to see what others think about Princeton. :D  \n\n\n*Edit 2:* I am an international.",

This school will teach you if you truly love physics or not, because any passion less than that will not be able to carry you through the insanely rigorous workload. TL;DR it\u2019s an amazing department with amazing people but hard as balls, and it taught me that I truly have a deep love for the subject.",

Princeton is the only true \u201cundergrad-focused\u201d Ivy and it\u2019s because grad students are actually just second-class citizens here. The profs are the greatest and would love to ramble about their research for hours if you asked them. It is kinda difficult as a frosh/sophomore to do internships/research because you kinda don\u2019t have a high enough level of physics knowledge to do the real fun stuff, but once you hit junior year it\u2019s all wide open. Do keep in mind that it\u2019s mostly theoretical/computational, so if you wanna like blow up shit in a lab, tbh MIT, Stanford, or Harvard may be more up your alley. I hate doing physical stuff and would much rather ponder theory and do computational analysis, so I like it here, but do keep in mind that our physical engineering/lab scene is kinda lacking compared to the more STEM-y elite institutions",

As far as I\u2019m aware, the 103/104 sequence is pretty uninformative and numbers h heavy if you\u2019ve ever taken AP physics. 105 starts out as an unreasonable amount of work, but teaches you SO much, so don\u2019t let it discourage you. 106 was terrible, but I believe that was just a covid discrepancy. Physics here has been great so far. Death Mech was pretty good though, just a little boring. Currently in quantum and I\u2019m loving it though. In the end there\u2019s some misses, but there\u2019s definitely also some big hits here. Go for it if you can if education is your ONLY consideration. But weigh your options on what you find most important.\n\n\nEdit: added more details.",

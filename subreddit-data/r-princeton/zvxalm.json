Happy for all those who were accepted early!!",

Goal is to sound like a real person with real interests and passions, like someone you\u2019d want to get to know and be friends with... and why you\u2019re interested in Princeton specifically, not just an Ivy League college. \n\nMy hot tip: Have a good number of questions! Interviewers love to chat about the good ol\u2019 days in college. :)",

The dude has a lot of really impressive and cool things on his resume and he even has a few albums I\u2019ve been listening to that are my latest fix. I plan on reading some essays he\u2019s written as well as listening to a podcast or two he\u2019s been on. He\u2019s a fascinating guy and I want to share that I think he\u2019s cool and inspiring without sounding like I\u2019m tryna get on his good side?",

Like\u2026 I saw you do  X and Y - did you do things related to that in college? How did what you studied at Princeton help you? etc. \n\nI am surprised when / if ever someone I interview has googled me lol so don\u2019t go to hard (in my opinion!) it\u2019s up to you of course. :)",

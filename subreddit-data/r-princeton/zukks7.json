    "postText": "Hello, sorry for the post but I am applying to Princeton and everyone I have asked has given me the same answer \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. I am a low income student. I have a 1450 super score (740 Math\u2026 710 Reading and Language), the founder of a volunteer club with 30 members, national merit scholar, gates semi-finalist, national hispanic recognition recipient, officer in stuCo, and Black Student Union. My GPA is a 3.89. I am an engineer major and have been named the member with most community service hours in a single school year (150+ hours). I am in the top 10% and a first gen university student. I will be graduating with my associates of science at the end of the year. I don\u2019t have any internships but I am currently looking into getting a potential one with Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee. \nI feel like I don\u2019t have any of the qualifying requirements but I\u2019m not sure.",

But to answer your question, I would submit by test scores if I were you, but even if you don\u2019t, test scores are only one thing they use to admit students, so you have many other opportunities to demonstrate why they should admit you. Good luck",

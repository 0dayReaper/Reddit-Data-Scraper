I have a younger sibling who\u2019s a sophomore in HS. \n\nShe has always dreamt of attending Princeton as a pre-med student, but I\u2019m at a loss for how to help her prepare.\n\nDo you guys have any project/activity ideas or tips that will help her stand out as an applicant (besides good grades, high standardized test scores, etc.)? Also, did any of you use any admissions counselors who you would recommend?\n\nI really want to help her, but I\u2019m a CS major &amp; everything I did in hs was related to engineering :\u2019)",

            "comment": "Having been a premed at Princeton, I highly discourage her from doing premed at Princeton. Ultra competitive, and grade deflation is really terrible when applying to med school. You\u2019re lucky if you end up with a decent gpa and are applying to the top med schools who are more familiar with Princeton applications and grade deflation. So many people I knew at Princeton killed their med school dreams bc of grade deflation. Also, Princeton doesn\u2019t have a med school, so you lose the advantage of going to the med school associated with your undergrad. I studied my ass off, got a 3.7 gpa in the sciences, and due to extracurriculars and post Princeton experience, got into a decent med school. But I cannot do it again. If she had the chops for an ivy, highly recommend somewhere else instead.",

Even the easiest classes are curved like 1/3 A, 1/3 B, and 1/3 C. More like half and half A and B in the higher level classes. So you\u2019re competing for that A with people who got into Princeton. And then you\u2019re competing with gpas from places with a better curve. Yeah, it\u2019s tough out there. I enjoyed my experience overall looking back, but during sophomore and junior years, really regretted not going elsewhere as a premed.",

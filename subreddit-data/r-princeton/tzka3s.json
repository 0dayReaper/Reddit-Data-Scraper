    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI am currently a high school senior who is interested in learning more about applying to Princeton as a transfer student. I understand that the University has been actively expanding its transfer capacity after reactivating the option in 2018.\n\nI was recently admitted to several liberal arts colleges with a collective ~$500,000 in scholarships. I will most likely be attending Connecticut College as a first-year student with an English major. But, depending on my experience there, I want to keep the option of transferring open\u2014and there is no school in this world I\u2019d like to attend more than Princeton. \n\nBy the time I would apply to transfer, I will have published an anthology that has been two years in the making, hopefully with decent sales, as well as a few other writings. In recent months, I was also considering joining the U.S. Army Reserve with active duty in the National Guard, so if I did transfer, Princeton would also see this military service, but I\u2019m unsure as to whether it would help my chances. If you know, please tell me!\n\nMy high school GPA will have been a ~3.7 overall, with a few advanced courses. But since Princeton is freshman blind, they will see a 3.9/4.0. If I do well at Connecticut College, say a 3.8-4.0, I think my grades would also be in line. It seemed that in this admissions cycle, I was simply not qualified to be admitted. But I would still love to pursue this option. \n\nAll I ask is that you please let me know about my current plan, and what changes I should make to maximize my chances. Thanks!",

Those stats sound fine, but most other applicants will be just as qualified. Lots of transfers here are former active duty military, but I don\u2019t think you joining the reserve/guard is going to automatically increase your chances. Transferring is a big hassle, especially at Princeton, and you\u2019re facing extremely long odds. If after you start college you still feel you want to transfer, apply, but make sure you choose some schools you have a very good chance at in addition to Princeton.",

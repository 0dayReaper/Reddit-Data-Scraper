            "comment": "1. I know some people who study all day long, but that\u2019s true anywhere. Most people have time for lots of other stuff.\n\n2. Big parties are centered around eating clubs (on prospect ave - \u201cthe street\u201d), but there are lots of smaller dorm parties. There\u2019s stuff to do most weekends.\n\n3. No more elitist than any other top university - you\u2019ll encounter elitism, but easy to avoid. Racism exists, but at a level equivalent to basically every university I\u2019ve heard about.\n\n4. Half of the eating clubs have bicker (kinda like rush) and are varying degrees of exclusive. Some of these (cap/tower) are pretty chill still (tower has a \u201cpositive only\u201d bicker). A few are more problematic (TI is very fratty, Ivy skews extremely wealthy). The other half of the eating clubs are sign-in, so everyone who wants to join gets to as long as there\u2019s space (and if there isn\u2019t, there\u2019s a lottery), and they\u2019re pretty unproblematic. Every college needs a place where kids can party and get alcohol, and eating clubs fill that niche. They have problems, but it\u2019s much better than having a frat-heavy campus instead. They aren\u2019t essential to social life; plenty of people choose to stay on the meal plan or go independent instead, and most clubs have lots of open events to attend even if you aren\u2019t a member. I think it\u2019s nice to be in one though.\n\n5. Some people do. Pre-Covid I went like 5 times per semester; I know some people who never went and some who went like every week. It\u2019s like 1.5 hours by rail. There\u2019s a lot to do on campus though, so it\u2019s not really necessary to go all the time",

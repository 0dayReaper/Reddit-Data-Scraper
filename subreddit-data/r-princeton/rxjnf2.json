    "postText": "Hello r/princeton !\n\nMy dad is going to celebrate his birthday pretty soon and I need your help.\n\nI'm currently a senior in German High school and just went through my application process. During those stressful months, my father was an amazing help for me. Despite working full time, he helped me with every aspect of the application he could. Because I don't have a college counselor, he literally spent entire days reviewing my Common App &amp; supplemental essays. With his birthday coming up, I wanted to show him my appreciation with a special gift.\n\nAs I have applied to eight universities, amongst them this one, my idea is to give him eight gifts, each one related to one of the universities. On top of that, I would love to give him a picture of each university's most recognizable building/place.\n\nAnd this is where I need your help!\n\nIt would be fantastic if one of you could take a picture of himself in front of Blair Arch, holding a sign with the words \u201cDaniel is the best dad in the world\u201d on it, this would be awesome! It would truly mean the world for me to show him my appreciation.\n\nPlease feel free to dm me if you can help me!\n\nAlso, if any of you have an idea what a fitting gift would be for Princeton, I would love to hear your suggestion!\n\nI apologize for possible grammatical mistakes. Unfortunately, my English hasn\u00b4t been the best lately.",

    "postText": "Mid-30s NJ resident here with a strange but totally serious request. I posted a few months ago and the response was more positive than I expected, and I even found a potential donor that unfortunately didn't work out, so I thought I'd give it another shot. Apologies if this post breaks any sub rules. \n\nI've been dealing with a pretty intense functional GI disorder and after a whole lot of testing and 10+ different medications that didn't help I've come to the point where I can either resign myself to being sick permanently or I can attempt a pretty radical treatment called [FMT or Fecal Microbiota Transplant]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_microbiota_transplant) which, with stool from a high-quality donor, can help with a variety of conditions. [This webcomic explains it pretty well, believe it or not]( http://threewordphrase.com/donor.htm).\n\nPretty wild, I know. It's gross, but not as gross as being sick for the rest of my life would be, so I'm trying to have a sense of humor about it. When I first heard about it I had the same WTF reaction you're probably having now. This procedure is approved and highly effective for treatment of C. Difficile infection, has shown promising results in clinical trials for several GI issues, and is even being researched as treatment for issues in other areas of the body. [Here's an article about it from a few years back](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/01/excrement-experiment).\n\nThe donor criteria is extremely strict and unfortunately none of my friends or family qualify, so I figured I would see if a kind stranger from the internet might help me with this weird, awkward thing that could improve my life one million percent.\n\nIf you or someone you know meet the following base criteria and would be willing to explore being a donor, please reach out to me via PM here or e-mail fmtftact1@gmail.com\n\t\n\nMale\n\nAge 18-30\n\nLean body type\n\nEssentially perfect physical and mental health\n\nNo allergies or food sensitivities\n\nVaried diet\n\nDaily perfect stool production,  presenting as [Bristol Type 3 Stool]( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c35d0b78-61cf-47f2-9c99-99c614898586/apt13746-fig-0001-m.png)\n\n\n\nThere are some more involved questions that would need to be answered, and a potential donor would have to be screened for pathogens, but after that all they would need to do is come to a convenient location and make a deposit, so to speak. I am local to North Jersey but will happily travel to make this happen.\n\nThanks for reading!",

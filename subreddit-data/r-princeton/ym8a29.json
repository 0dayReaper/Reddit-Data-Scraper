            "comment": "You can take metro north from New Haven to grand central. Then take NJ transit from Penn station to Princeton. It is less convenient than Amtrak bc you have to get across town from grand central to Penn station, but it should be cheaper. You can buy tickets at the station but check the schedules ahead of time.",

            "comment": "I take Amtrak NE regional, Metro-North New Haven Line, and NJ Transit to Princeton Junction/Princeton about once a month. Here a few things to bear in mind: As other commentators have mentioned few Amtraks stop in Princeton Junction. Those that do will be locals. If you can leave and return from Trenton that\u2019s a better choice (I have never booked an Amtrak to or from MetroPark. I don\u2019t know how close it is from Princeton). Amtrak is the fastest way to go and sometimes it is not much more expensive. HOWEVER, if you decide on Amtrak, don\u2019t wait to book. The price goes up as the train fills up. If you book through the APP, you can easily change the departure time. I think any changes need to be done two hours before and the price may be different. Metro North is fast, well-priced, and tickets are easy to purchase through the App. Do check the duration of the ride. Some trains run express. NJ Transit may be the worst commuter line in the county. There are few express trains on the weekend. Don\u2019t count on when the train arrives in your destination station. Finally, if you decide to do the NJ Transit/Meto-North route, decide beforehand how you will transfer between Penn and Grand Central. The subway is the fastest, cheapest route. The 1 train one stop UPTOWN to 42nd then the shuttle (the S) to Grand Central. You can also take the 7, but I would not. The 7 is notoriously unreliable. Either way, check straphangers.com and see if any of those lines are having delays or not running. HOWEVER, the subway transfer is confusing\u2014allow time to get lost. For a taxi, go to the 8th Ave taxi line\noutside Penn. I graduated years ago and since I am probably as old as your mother, I avoid Uber and Lyfts outside Penn. It\u2019s hard to find the driver. Honestly, either way has its pluses and minuses. Grand Central is stunning and there\u2019s a awe-inspiring Apple store. Penn is the fifth level of hell.\n\nPS on the ride in CT, get a window seat on the right-hand side. Between Stanford and NH, the view of the coast is gorgeous.",

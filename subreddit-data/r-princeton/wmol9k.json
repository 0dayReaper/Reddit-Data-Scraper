I'm just a rising senior doing some research lol and Princeton is one of my dream schools and I've been playing tennis for a while and on my high school's team. I'm not good enough to get recruited or play for a professional team. I kinda just wanted to play for fun and I was trying to find schools that have a tennis presence which, from what I've heard, Princeton does have",

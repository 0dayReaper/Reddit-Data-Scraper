    "postText": "SMAD major here w/ a dvc concentration, so i have to either double major or minor.  I'm interested in a business major or minor that will help me become better at budgeting, making business deals and overall understanding the different markets (especially when it comes to investing); however I'm not that great at math. Would I benefit more by minoring in the music industry to complement my major and just taking side classes for business like stats?  (I've heard that a business degree is actually not that worth it, since nowadays everything can be learned online and I also don't wanna work at a corp. So I don't wanna pay for it if I don't rlly need it to become better at having a more critical business mind).  I'm thinking of just taking some classes in the music industry and business w/out having to minor in them if I'm allowed, since I just need to get 40 extra credits. I'm not required to major/minor in something else, but it's highly encouraged.",

    "postText": "Hey! Incoming Freshman, was wondering about the meal plans. I\u2019ve seen all of them, but was wondering what most people end up going with / recommendations \nAlso, I see one of the differences with the all access plans is that they have \u201c3 punches per day to use for Duke Deals and equivalency punches.\u201d I could probably figure it out with enough searching but if someone could tell me here it\u2019d be greatly appreciated, what are those deals and are they worth it?",

            "comment": "For the regular 11 and 14 punch plans, a punch can be used for D hall, E hall, Duke Deals, or at Festival/Market 64 price equivalency ($7 per punch). Duke Deals cover popular meals at most places (Chick Fil A, Steak n' Shake, etc.). You can use however many of these punches you want on any given day, and the number resets on Sundays. The difference with all access is that they split it into different punch amounts for the dining halls and the alternatives - so you can punch into D hall or E hall any time you want with no daily or weekly limit, and you also have 3 separate punches that can be used anywhere that takes them aside from the dining halls. \n\nI had all access and it's impossible to use that many punches in a week, they go to waste - I don't even end up spending all of my current 14 usually. I believe most people have 11 or 14 punch - depending on where you plan to eat, having more dining dollars from the 11 punch plan can come in handy (ex. Panera doesn't take punches, but you can use dining dollars; same with the vending machines).",

            "comment": "I loved the all access. Unlimited into D-hall + 3 punches at Market, Festival, freshens, and everything else. I always liked getting a smoothie at freshens, which is a punch, plus a sandwich which is another punch. If you do that with the 14, you can only do that every day &amp; nothing else. There were some times that I didn\u2019t use all 3 (when I planned to go to the Dennys or something that night but didn\u2019t get the chance) but most days, I was able to buy snacks or something if I didn\u2019t need all my punches. Plus, it\u2019s way less stressful to plan a whole week of meals.",

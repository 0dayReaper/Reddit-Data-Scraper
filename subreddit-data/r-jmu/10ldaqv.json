    "postText": "I applied to JMU during EA. I found out that I was deferred and accepted at Christopher Newport University. This crushed me because JMU was the college of my dream and it fit me well. (I hve no problem with CNU) I learned that being deferred isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing from you guys. I just want to know my chances of getting in after being deferred. I know you guys are not the admissions department, (which btw I did email the admission department) but I know some of you were deferred but later accepted.)Could you guys guide me? I might be a little lost. \nTysm!! \n\n-3.6 GPA\n-3 AP classes\n-4 honors classes\n-President of Model United Nations\n-Part time job for 2 years \n-Feed homeless \n-Cultural Dancer \n-Veteran Clarinet Marcher \n[always had A\u2019s // couple B\u2019S]\n-Speak 3 languages",

Talk to your school guidance counselor and see what he/she recommends, but I certainly don't think it'd hurt. Good luck!",

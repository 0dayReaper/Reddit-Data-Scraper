Two tiny showers and two toilets shared between 12 people on average and really bad A/C systems. Despite all of that, I met my best friends there and I think you'd be missing out on potential connections only rooming with one person like on East Campus. Village also puts you pretty much in the center of everything, so all of the dining halls / academic halls are a pretty easy walk.",

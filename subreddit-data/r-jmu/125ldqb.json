Cons: Buildings are old and run down with rumors of black mold, there's no AC (it's not too bad), it can get very loud sometimes since the village dorms are the \"party dorms\" if you get bad suitemates it will suck. Overall, if you don't mind walking/taking the bus, I would recommend picking another dorm. If you still stick with the village, it all depends on what kind of experience you want to have with your freshman year. \n\n3. Yes, there are LOTS of organized sports/activities through UREC",

If you\u2019re looking to stay closer to main campus and don\u2019t want the craziness of village then hillside is probably your best option. There\u2019s a bus stop nearby if you wanted to take ICS to get to East Campus and the quad is not even a 5 minute walk.",

            "comment": "Food has gone downhill since 2019. We were #1 in food for a year or two in 2017 and 2018 but then Aramark took that as an opportunity to begin overcharging for crappier food, with the excuse being newer food buildings like dhall, and the new dining hall with panda/dennys/etc.. There are some decent places, but its not the same as it was 4 years ago.\n\nVillage is\u2026 fine. Its in the middle of campus, which is a great location, but in my opinion, Hillside &gt; Village. Its in virtually the same spot except you actually get AC. I think JMU\u2019s trying to renovate the Village at some point and add ac, but just get a fan and you\u2019ll be fine in the warmer parts of the year. The heat is nice in the colder months, sometimes even to the point that i\u2019ll see people open their windows slightly to balance out the room temperature. \nA majority of on-campus parties take place in the village, so depending on your stance with that, pick your roommates/suitemates wisely. \n\nABSOLUTELY. There are tons of sport clubs that are not as competitive as the NCAA teams on campus. I know a lot of people that played club ultimate frisbee or club tennis/basketball. UREC also has some casual events for this and people will go there just to play with friends all the time.",

            "comment": "1. Most of the food is mid. I work at D-Hall and I\u2019m usually involved with the chicken tender place there. I personally think that\u2019s the best option at D-Hall specifically (no bias intended), surely the most popular. I\u2019m not a fan of E-Hall (on east campus) too much and Festival is ok. There\u2019s also several ala carte options at D-Hall and Dukes Dining that are decent as well. I would personally prefer to cook my own food at my apartment and you\u2019ll probably want to do the same if you decide the following year to move into one.\n2. Can\u2019t say because I lived in Skyline, but I\u2019ve heard the many stories from JMU students past who stayed there. No AC, no elevator, fire alarms every night, and it\u2019s the epicenter of most campus diseases and what I call the \u201cJ-M-Flu\u201d (when everyone gets sick).\n3. Someone else could tell you about this.",

            "comment": "1.) Food is definitely above average, albeit pretty bland. \n2.) Pros: social life. Cons: they\u2019re just shitty and kinda run down. no a/c, everything is uphill from where you are, dorms are smaller, etc. I recommend bluestone for choice of dorms. It\u2019s closest to where most of your freshman gen ed\u2019s are gonna be, you\u2019re right by down town, and the social life is still pretty good. \n3.) Oh yeah. UREC is pretty great, tbh. there\u2019s also intramural leagues and club sports you can join, too.",

            "comment": "2. I enjoyed living in the village, but it all comes down to suite mates. I got lucky and had good suite mates, we used our suite to hang out a lot and made it nice, but had friends that didn\u2019t use theirs at all and it stayed empty. Also I think all the suites have AC now, but I don\u2019t believe the individual rooms do.\n\n3. Tons of way to stay active whether is working out at UREC, intramural sports are huge, clubs for just about everything athletic/active, you\u2019ll even meet people who play pickup soccer/basketball/volleyball all the time",

Probably the most fun as long as u have good roommates/suitemates. It is a bit older and you dont have A/C in your room, only in the common room.\n3. There are a ridiculous amount of opportunities to stay active whether if it\u2019s with clubs or through UREC",

There's a lot of variety. \n\n2. pros of village- good location(between main and east campus). close to the stadium. cons- no air conditioning, fire alarm goes off a lot. The walls are thin.  I don't like partying, but there's lot of parties in the village. \n\n3. there's a lot of intermural sports through urec. there's also the club sports.",

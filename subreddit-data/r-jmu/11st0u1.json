If not, because of your focus go for something like Human Resource Dev, Cultural Communication, Urban and Regional Studies, Women's studies, or something like that.",

I feel like a Spanish major has diminishing values from a minor, and can be easily, and arguably more effectively learned in other ways (self learned, or experience based) where the extra credits may be better suited towards something else.",

Although, you make a very good point",

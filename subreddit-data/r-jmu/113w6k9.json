Looking for info on off-campus dining/shopping/bars...is there an area close to campus that I should check out while I'm there? Also, would love any food recommendations that I shouldn't miss and anything on campus/in the area that would be a must-visit. Thank you all so much!!!",

A good cheap Chinese place? \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for something to do off campus and the weather is nice, go walk around downtown! There\u2019s tons of little shops so you\u2019ll for sure find something for you.\n\nPersonally I\u2019d say visit Mashita, it\u2019s an Asian fusion restaurant that I think is the best restaurant in Hburg, but some of their dishes aren\u2019t to everyone\u2019s tastes. \n\nLmk if you have any questions and I hope you pick JMU :)",

            "comment": "If you\u2019re in the mood for tacos you should get Magnolias or for a burger and fries do Jack Browns (both in downtown which you should visit if you can!) If you want a quick sandwich or bagel to start the day go to Mr. Jays! For a nicer dinner of delicious pasta Vitos. For a banger grilled cheese sandwhich go to Grilled Cheese Mania. For a sweet treat, go to Kline\u2019s they have incredible ice cream! There\u2019s a ridiculous amount of good food in Harrisonburg and places that aren\u2019t large chains. \n\nI would recommend if you have a chance to wander campus unguided, go to the quad and walk. See how the campus is on a typical day. Go to Downtown Harrisonburg (a short walk from campus) and wander a little! There\u2019s a lot of restaurants and little shops in downtown. Go to the academic building your major is housed in (you can find that info on the JMU majors site, or just ask here and someone can help find it) and sit and observe what it\u2019s like. JMU is pretty easily walkable using Google/Apple Maps so you can put stuff in and follow directions. Explore where you feel you need to, CHOICES is a great way to learn about the school and what it\u2019ll look like to go, but you don\u2019t get much of a chance to explore or see students being students. \n\nI graduated last May and miss JMU everyday. I hope JMU is the right pick for you because there\u2019s no place like it in the world :)",

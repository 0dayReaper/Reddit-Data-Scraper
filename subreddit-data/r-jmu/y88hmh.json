    "postText": "I have a friend that visited right before fall break and he is currently at Mbu which is more expensive then jmu and much lower quality so he decided he's gonna try and transfer to JMU in fall 2023. How difficult is it to be accepted through transfer? I'm not sure about his currents grades and such I'm just curious to see what everyone else thinks",

            "comment": "It just depends mostly on his grades. JMU only lets in a certain amount of transfers each semester so it can get competitive. The transfer application for JMU is identical to the normal application. In terms of transfer credits, that\u2019ll be something left up to the registrar. JMU does however offer in-person \u2018interviews\u2019 early during the spring semester where you can find out directly after if you\u2019ll be admitted for the next semester (fall 2023).",

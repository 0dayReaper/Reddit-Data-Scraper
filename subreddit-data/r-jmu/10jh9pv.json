The hiring committee for a given position will choose the student they know over someone they don't know almost every time. \n\nThis might have changed since 2019 but politics plays a roll with which students gets campus positions.\n\nAramark positions are more like a traditional hiring process.",

They only care about what they need and if they feel you are what they need they will care about what they need to offer you to get you to work for them.\n\nAt JMU for student positions the priorities of the hiring committees in my experience is they hire people they know or people who know someone they know. It does not matter how qualified you are for the position, if you do not have the connections you are not going to get the job.\n\nI have personally seen multiple incidents of JMU offices reopening postings for student jobs because none of the applicants had connections to people on the hiring committee for that position. I also have a friend who noticed the same thing and I checked my findings with him to make sure we are not crazy.\n\nIf you want an office position on campus with JMU you will need to network.\n\nDepending on your career, you may find more value working for Aramark. Aramark is a physically and in some cases mentally harder job than most administrative roles at JMU but you will get more experience out of it. This would also help diversify your library of experience.\n\nAs someone who is often on hiring committees for engineering positions in industry I find candidates with a diverse background of experiences more valuable than candidates who only has experience in a single field. If someone like me is on your hiring committee for your first post graduation job I would value work with Aramark over a administrative position with a university office. To me as a hiring committee member it says to me you are willing to do whatever work is necessary to complete a mission.",

That is the best way to get a office assistant job.\n\nMany students who are in administrative assistant positions networked into those positions through Service Orgs or Greek Life. If money is not a issue then that is a option for building up your network. \n\nAnother option is to look for part time work in Harrisonburg. There will be more people in the hiring pool for off campus jobs but nepotism is much less of a issue for these jobs.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking what are you looking for specifically or what do you want to do with your career? The advise I gave can apply to anyone at JMU but if I know more about what you are studying or you plans I might be able to give better advice other than Aramark. It would not be a office position but it might be a step down your desired path.",

The closest thing you might get would be a Operations Assistant or House Manager.\n\nAs far as marketing positions goes if you have creative skills like Photography, Videography, or Graphics Design you might be able to get a job with TaD (Technology and Design). Most people who work in marketing have a background in one or more of these areas.\n\nOther departments also have marketing positions but TaD is basically a internal marketing firm to JMU.\n\nMost service orgs have marketing positions on their leadership teams.

I've never had something like this happen to me before and I hope it'll be the last. \n\nTo anyone parking on the east side of campus: be aware of this and please report if you see it happening to anyone else's car. \n\nTo the person / people who did this: my car is my pride and joy. I spent an hour in 32 degrees outside washing raw egg off my car. I will not hesitate to report this to JMU / Harrisonburg authorities.",

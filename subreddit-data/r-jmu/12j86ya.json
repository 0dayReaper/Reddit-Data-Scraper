Admission in Fall \u201822 was tough and each year acceptance is getting harder. It\u2019s no longer the VA state safety school with a high 70s admit rate. This is all based on my son\u2019s experience with his \u201822 application process. It\u2019s easier and cheaper for a high stat NoVa student to go out of state than get in VT and JMU.",

    "postText": "I am struggling to find housing as a grad student. I am looking for a quiet place (so no parties/loud noises past 10 pm) that is close to campus (1-2 miles max). I prefer something downtown, but it looks like most places like ice house/urban exchange are leased out :/ I am having a hard time picking a place! please shed some light on apartments that are preferably furnished and under $800 total around JMU.",

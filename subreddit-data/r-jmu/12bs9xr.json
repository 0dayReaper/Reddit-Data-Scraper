For me personally I loved the location since it's right next to the business school so I had a ton of classes there. Idk if it's still open, but ms greens was there too and that was my go to spot. \n\nI'll also say Saturday mornings of game day the marching band practices and it's insanely loud. It's awful. \n\nI'd say if you're a business student, it's actually very nice. Anything else and it's not great.\n\nEdit: bathrooms were kinda not great. Not much privacy and I usually wore flip flops bc I didn't trust the floor",

The elevators are unreliable even though the building is a mid rise.\n\nBasically imagine the village but much worse and without the village community. Eagle does have its own community but it is not as tight knit as the communities that form naturally in the village.",

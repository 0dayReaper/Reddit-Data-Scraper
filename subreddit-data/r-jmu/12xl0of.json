            "comment": "granted I graduated in 2016 but Rubys arcade was the spot back then.  dont know how it is now but it was always fun.  It's behind Clementines/Rubys and faces that parking deck.  dope spot.  but if you want a spot that has TV's. pool tables, ping pong, bowling, darts, shuffleboard, games, etc.  thats the spot hands down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSticky Nugs from billy jacks was always a highlight.  drinks too of course\n\nif you dress up nice, and really want to class it up you can try to get into Jacks hideaway which is a \"speakeasy\" on that side street of billy jacks.  you'll have to knock.  if youre too drunk they'll turn you away.\n\nGolden Pony is further up main st but its def a slept on spot.  usually will have live music on the weekends down in the basement.\n\nIf you want $1 jello shots (again... 7 years ago now idk) and a grimy atmosphere Finns is another solid option.  def more locals then students there but its a fun time.\n\nif you're looking for something more laid back, Three Knotchd and Restless Moons are good brewerys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nyeah that pretty much sums up my list I guess.",

I lived downtown my senior year and had a job in the area for like the 4 years after that, so I  had plenty of time to try all of it lol.\n\nOh, and they don't serve alcohol but Benny's pizza is a great way to end the night with their gigantic slices.  I think they stay open till 2 or 3.\n\nAnd one last spot.  It was only a food truck when I graduated but later turned into an operating brick and mortar bar.  Urgies Cheeseteaks.  It's tiny.  But if you like sports and want to switch it up from bdubs it's a really cool Philly themed bar.  And the tots are insane.",

But if ur looking for somewhere to dance and shit as well I'd say Golden Pony is ur best bet, they just don't specialize in brewing aside from some of their mixed drinks but they do a good job at taking care of any bs that might go down as opposed to other places that are kinda hit or miss on that front and have decent food",

Urgie\u2019s has great cheesesteaks but the space is small indoors and is better outdoors so try to go when the weather is nice. \n\nFinn\u2019s is the best bar imo but I only say that because I think the drinks are cheap, I can smoke indoors, and I always end up running into old/new friends when I go there. It\u2019s definitely an *acquired* taste for some.",

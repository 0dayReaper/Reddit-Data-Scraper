            "comment": "I\u2019m a 2009 alum, so I\u2019m going off of my memory, but I also go back regularly for football games and some other sporting events.\n\nIt is a large campus and continues to grow in modest ways. However, I felt it was walkable as an able bodied person. It is very hilly and can certainly be a workout walking consistently all over the campus, but there\u2019s paths throughout. They really made it a walkable campus.\n\nThere is an extensive on and off campus bus system in coordination with Harrisonburg public transit. They run regularly and it looks like they\u2019ve only improved the infrastructure related to the buses since I was a student.\n\nI recommend you research JMU.edu. They had detailed information when I was a student and I\u2019d think it\u2019s only improved since. Take a campus tour if you have not already to get an idea of the campus size and they will answer your questions in more detail.\n\nIn relation to your major, I recommend googling the types of careers that field leads to, as well as asking an academic advisor that may be available to prospective students. JMU should have an extensive network for current and prospective student assistance.\n\nIt\u2019s an amazing university and I wish you luck in your decision. Go Dukes!",

But definitely VERY hard with the amount of math and finance. \n\n/u/saraphim12 definitely be prepared for difficult classes and backups if the major doesn\u2019t pan out.\n\nAs for walking the biggest issue would be the amount of hills. Bus service is great though. But it\u2019s nowhere near as bustling/traffic heavy as VCU. Suburban campus. You can avoid having to cross in most cases",

The building is state of the art and they have lot of resources for you to take advantage of. They also have lots of resources for getting internships and jobs after college!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m not a Q fin major but a math major. I would suggest looking at the BLS website for careers in finance so you can gain some insight about the field as well as all the stats about salary, requirements, growth rate , and etc. as well as college scorecard .gov that gives a bunch of stats on universities. As far as Q fin I have only actually meant one on campus but they do have to take a lot of math you can double major or minor in math in the program from my knowledge.  I\u2019m pretty sure Q fins can get jobs in a lot if not all jobs in the finance sector. They can also probably get jobs outside of that sector like being an operations research analyst or actuary.",

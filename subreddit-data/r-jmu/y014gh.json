    "postText": "My son is pledging a frat now and I\u2019m disgusted by the stuff I hear him talking about - forced workouts, cleaning houses, and the Sunday night \u201clines\u201d that I think are pure hazing.  I do like the pledges being DD\u2019s however for both guys and girls on campus.  He mentioned recently that a few frats were kicked off campus.  Anyone know if it was for hazing?",

Well really it depends on what you mean by \u201cSunday Night Lines\u201d.\n\nHowever I would also say that every Fraternity at JMU (that only accepted men) that I know of did have their pledges do stuff that was way worse then the stuff you mentioned, and that I would obviously consider hazing. \n\nCourse I\u2019m not gonna tell you how to treat you son, but if it were me I\u2019d only take action if I thought he was in physical danger, and the rest is up to him. After all he is an adult and has to live with the results of his actions.",

And because they are driving other people's cars they are not covered by the car insurance. And when that happens I get stuck with the repair bill because the car insurance refuses to pay since an uninsured driver was driving the other vehicle.",

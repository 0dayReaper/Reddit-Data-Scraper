I came in during the pandemic and just struggled to find groups of people. I have friend groups, but I wanna be more active. I know we\u2019re a month into the semester, but any clubs/orgs that people recommend getting involved in? I\u2019m not a party person, but just kinda wanna branch out and meet new people.",

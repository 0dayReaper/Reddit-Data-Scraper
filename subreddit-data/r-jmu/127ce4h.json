My brothers had people wearing weird clothes. Huge miss imo. \n\nBut I am glad to hear the fraternity lives on, even though it sounds like it hasn\u2019t changed much. \n\nI still don\u2019t understand why fraternities need national charters. Why can\u2019t people just slap some Greek letters on their house and call it a day?",

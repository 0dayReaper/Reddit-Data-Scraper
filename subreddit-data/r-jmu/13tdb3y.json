            "comment": "Like the other user said, air conditioning is definitely nice and the location is more beneficial if you\u2019re going to take lots of science classes. I personally didn\u2019t mind walking 15-20 minutes to the quad for my classes over there. The proximity to e-hall is SUPER nice! It would literally take me 2 or 3 minutes to walk out of my dorm room and then get to food. It was also pretty nice having people in your honors classes living in the same dorm as you bc you could recognize people and study together easily. Also, if you\u2019re planning to take advantage of living in Apartments on Grace the following year, it\u2019s easier to meet other honors people to room with. If you have any other questions I\u2019d be happy to answer!",

            "comment": "I just moved out of Shenandoah a few weeks ago and absolutely loved my time there. It\u2019s a super nice dorm with air conditioning and bigger rooms. It has 2 study lounges and a tv lounge which is super nice to have. It\u2019s literally a 20 second walk from e hall. The people there are all great and it\u2019s nice living with other people in honors because you\u2019ll have them in your classes/similar classes. Also, my roommate wasn\u2019t in honors but I was able to have her live in doah with me. Live in doah!",

Throughout the show, he kept having to get an abnormal amount of people out of their \u201ctrance\u201d because they were crying, shaking, or other things. The tipping point was when a FROG was sobbing uncontrollably, was unable to walk with assistance (she literally collapsed), and had to be escorted out. After that, the hypnotist was unable to get one of the guys out of his trance. We were all escorted out the back door and there were many police, ambulances, and fire trucks there. \n\nI\u2019m just curious to see if the school will release a statement about it or not!",

            "comment": "Hey guys, just wanted to weigh in.  I was running the sound for the hypnotist event so I spoke with Jon Wayes before and after the show in addition to witnessing the event first hand.  I had never met Jon before Saturday night, but by all accounts he is a skilled performer and has been touring for about ten years.  \n\nI do not believe he is a misogynist.   He was attempting to build rapport with the students by resorting to \"bro\" humor.  Certainly, in today's climate it was not a wise choice, but he was not trying to make anybody uncomfortable.  He was a nice guy, professional, and was emotionally affected himself by what transpired.  \n\nBy his own admission, this event was a disaster.  He simply took on too many students at once.  He warned the audience in no uncertain terms that they should not volunteer if they have had past emotional problems, were under the influence, or were pregnant.  It seems to me that some students ignored this warning and hence were caught unawares when they were asked to \"stay under\" for long periods of time.  \n\nThe vibe in the Convo was weird from the word go and Jon spent most of his time handling students that were shaking, crying, or otherwise reacting badly, which caused a cascading effect throughout the crowd.  When he realized that the situation was out of control, he stopped the show and spent the next hour tending personally to any students that needed help before succumbing to tears himself.  He told me that it was not unusual for participants to have negative reactions and that it happens at least once a show, but that this time it got out of hand.  When we spoke after it was all over, he was visibly shaken by what had happened and especially by the treatment he received from the female staff, who felt that he paid too much attention to the young ladies in the audience, and told him so with some venom.  \n\nAgain, from my perspective, from speaking with him personally, I did not feel he was intentionally targeting anyone, but did make bad choices when it came to his humor delivered from the stage.  Putting volunteers into uncomfortable and embarrassing situations is part of the humor of the event and I also saw many students posing with \"frozen\" volunteers to get selfies to have a laugh at later.  All of the students that participated were volunteers and many could not handle what transpired.  It was really unfortunate that a night of laughs ended with tears and recriminations.",

She herself started feeling dizzy and very tired, so she opened her eyes to keep from being hypnotised. The feeling scared her. That's the first time I knew or even thought hypnosis is real.\n\nAs for the school, they're not covering anything up. They've asked people to voluntarily refrain from posting videos because there are kids on the videos in distress, some appearing unconscious, draped over chairs (I saw video posted privately by my daughter). Parents of these kids would be upset if they saw those videos before they knew what happened and that their kid was OK. And even then, they would not want their kids exposed like that. I would certainly want people to not share it if my daughter was in a video like that.\n\nEDIT: On further thought, I don't know that anyone from the school asked people to remove videos from posts. I saw a parent ask that. She was an administrator of an unofficial Facebook group for parents (there is a separate official group run by the school). She asked people to voluntarily not share videos privately for the reasons I stated above, and said she would delete any posted to the private group).",

While the vast majority of students were fine, there were some who had a difficult time coming out of the hypnosis and we worked with each of them to ensure their safety through the support of their FROGs, RAs, and OPAs.  \n\n\nI am incredibly sorry for anyone that had a negative experience and we have asked our counselors from the Counseling Center to come in today for anyone that needs to talk about this event or any stress and anxiety they are feeling going into the first day of classes tomorrow.  We know that for some of our students they are managing lots of emotion with the transition to college and we want to ensure that they have the support they need.  Something like this shouldn\u2019t happen and we will be sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again and I encourage you all to have any of your students that were negatively impacted go see the Counseling Center today starting at 11am. \n\n\nMost students weren\u2019t in attendance last night so I don\u2019t want to unnecessarily worry them if they weren\u2019t actually impacted.  We want them all to focus on a positive end to their first week at JMU and help them prepare for the start of classes on Monday.  Please feel free to email me directly with specific concerns and we can follow up with those impacted individually as needed.  My email again is millertm@jmu.edu and thank you all, as always for your passion and support for your students and JMU.",

And then if there are ppl who have anxiety or panic attack\u2019s and are triggered by seeing someone else experience what they think is one or is one, then you have ppl to tend to that never volunteered but still need to be brought back to a frame of mind that is good for them. From all the reports from tv, news and on here. That exactly what it sounds like happened on top of kids volunteering even AFTER the Hypnotist gave clear warnings NOT to volunteer if you suffer/experience certain issues. \n\nThe Hypnotist has apologized and did admit he took on too many students. Which coupled with what sounds like happened explains why it went downhill so fast. But also didn\u2019t help with rumors and speculation going rampaged with what didn\u2019t actually happen. \n\nAll in all the Hypnotist did what he was supposed to do and attend to all affected students individually as needed long after the show ended. So I really don\u2019t feel/think JMU has a leg to stand on by withholding his payment.\n\nNo one withheld Michael Jackson\u2019s money when fans were legit passing out and carried away on stretchers and for physically hurt trying to get to him. Why is that? Because it wasn\u2019t HIS fault. You can control how other ppl react to events and situations. All you can do is act accordingly in the moment and do everything you can to help. It\u2019s clear the Hypnotist did just that. Bottom line, he deserves his payment.",

He is VERY meticulous and conscious of how he preforms at every event. He even teaches other how to hypnotize professionally and to my knowledge has not had any issues, I am one of the trainees and can vouch for his training and ethics.\n\nFor the guy who is saying that he is apparently untrained and everything else. Trust me he\u2019s not, and since there are not video clips from what I\u2019ve seen you can\u2019t just hang a man based on hearsay.  There is so much hate in the Hypnotic community already that we shouldn\u2019t job to such accusations.\n\nI\u2019ve yet to personally speak with him about this event. I only learned about it when a client of mine sent me the news article and asked my option. Was not until I did my research that I found out who it was. \n\nI was not there for this event but I do know how he runs his shows and what to expect. What the person above commented who did the sound for the show, described what he did and should have done based on his training. He stopped the show and attend to the volunteers that had abreactions. As for others saying that he\u2019s a misogynistic and far from it. As the guy said before, it seems he went to the \u201cbro humor\u201d way which can be hit or miss with some audiences. Clearly this one was a miss.\n\nAs the comment above stated, he saw he was physically and emotionally affected by this and I\u2019m sure has replayed it over and over again in his mind trying to figure out what went wrong. He\u2019s is a good man and a great performer. Everyone has their off days and bad shows and he\u2019s no different. It just so happens that this one was publicized and clearly not getting the entire story. It also doesn\u2019t help that people who know SHIT about hypnosis are commenting on different forums and attacking him thinking they know the first thing about hypnosis other that what movies have told them.\n\nI absolutely feel bad for everyone involved and it\u2019s clear like above, some people did NOT listen to his pre talk speech and warnings. At that point that is all on them as they are adults. \n\nFurthermore, I\u2019m sure if other people found him to be unprofessional or untrained and inept at performing. Then he wouldn\u2019t be part of two world known entertainment agencies for several years with no issues or be able to be insured for well over a million dollars for each event in case anything does go wrong.\n\nI would personally wait until you hear his side of the story as well before making a full opinion, so that the opinion can be fully based on facts.\n\nJust my two cents.",

    "postText": "I'm a rising junior majoring in Finance and have been recently thinking about possibly rushing a business frat in the fall. I will not be taking COB 300 until the spring for reference. I want to know if anyone is/has been in one and what the pros and cons are. I already know that it is a huge time commitment and I want to figure out if it's even worth rushing.",

            "comment": "I was in a Business Frat when I was in college (2014-2018). There are some great benefits to joining a co-ed organization with the biggest one being is you gain a great group of friends. When I was in school it was definitely a bit harder to get in as a Junior, unless you were a recent transfer from CC. It's good you're not rushing during COB 300 because there is a big time commitment while pledging. What specific questions/ concerns did you have?",

And I hear mixed things about how it can be hard to find your people if you don\u2019t find them fast, drama, the time commitment obviously, etc. But I also hear a lot of good things. I think I plan on attending the info sessions at least but I wanna have an idea of what it would be like first.",

As far as finding people, if you make it into an org, everyone is going to work hard to become friends with you, they want to be your friend and thats why they voted you to join their organization. You'll also be in the trenches with your fellow pledges and grow close with them, since you'll be spending a lot of time with them. \n\nAs far as drama, sure there will always be drama in any organization especially ones that are co-ed. While business frats don't officially throw parties, they will be the people you party with.   \n\nI definitely suggest going to a couple info sessions/ rush events and get a feel which org you think you'd mesh well with. It's a huge time commitment, you'll have a weekly pledge meeting, have to meet/ interview a bunch of brothers each week, fundraising events, community service, professional events, social events, intramural sports, sober driving, etc. Its a ton of fun though, highly suggest!",

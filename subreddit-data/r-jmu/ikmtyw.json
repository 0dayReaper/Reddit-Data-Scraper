    "postText": "As an alumnus and Hburg resident, it seriously pisses me off to receive emails asking me to donate money when they are keeping the university open and endangering the lives of students and the wider Harrisonburg community. It is shameful that our alma mater is treating their students, faculty, staff, and welcoming Harrisonburg community with such negligence and disrespect. It is alarming to see the dashboard, knowing that the numbers are likely much higher in reality. The only thing I want to \"give\" JMU is a kick in the ass. /rant",

If Alger did nothing, JMU wouldn't be in the mess it is right now. Their entire response, as uncoordinated and lackluster as it appears, was still planned out by him and several other people. \n\nThis is true of all executives no matter the industry. They spend all their time in meetings and making hundreds, if not thousands of decisions every week. It becomes immediately obvious how important your CEO, COO, manager, etc. is once you're working full time and you realize how much of the culture and structure of the organization comes from them.",

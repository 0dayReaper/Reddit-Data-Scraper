    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm looking to re-let a room in the Harrison after deciding to not return for a master's degree. The rent is on the cheaper side (I pay 419, my roommates pay 424) and the area is pretty great. It's a five minute car/bus ride to campus or a 20 minute walk, and it's walkable to Devon lane or Manor gap if partying is your vibe. The clubhouse is just across the street and has free coffee, a pool, and a gym. Willing to give a tour or answer questions, just reach out. \n\nOh, and since this is a re-let and not a sublet, ownership of the apartment transfers upon signing instead having to rent from someone who's already renting.",

Also the student org night is this Friday where you can check out every org there and see what they all do/talk to members. Personally, I\u2019m part of the rowing club and it\u2019s a really amazing group of people, but definitely not for everyone if you don\u2019t like waking up early lol. Hope this helps though :) [https://www.jmu.edu/osl/studentactivities/organization-resources/student-organization-night.shtml](https://www.jmu.edu/osl/studentactivities/organization-resources/student-organization-night.shtml)",

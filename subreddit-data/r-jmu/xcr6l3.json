If you haven't already reviewed the JMU Nursing website for transfer students, I highly recommend doing that.",

It turned out not to matter because I ended up loving my music minor so much that I switched to music, but yeah, the JMU liaison at my community college did not do a good job of making the JMU-GPA-before-nursing-application requirement clear.",

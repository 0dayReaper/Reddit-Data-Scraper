I don't mind going out but I personally don't drink. Would this program be a decent fit? I love traveling and meeting new people and it sounds incredible.",

            "comment": "I will say this- from what I know about the programs, london is probably the best fit. Salamanca is all in Spanish, Antwerp is COB 300 only (I studied in Antwerp- biiiig drinking area) and Florence is also big parties in Italy. In general, if I had to guess based on what you said, london is probably the best fit for you, but classes available, personal preference for culture, and other stuff matters more. Also, if you don\u2019t drink due to taste, the cider in london is massively popular and very good taste, which is a nice plus",

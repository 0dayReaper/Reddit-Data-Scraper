My favorites were Chinese culture CHIN 490, modern Japanese culture FLE 490, Korean culture KOR 447, and Japanese culture HUM 252. If you just want something easy I found CHIN 490 and FLE 490 to be the easiest. Even if you are not interested in those cultures specifically I\u2019m sure there are others offered under the other language departments.",

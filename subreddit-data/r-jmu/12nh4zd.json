They do priority based on when the contract is signed I believe. As long as you don\u2019t wait for forever, you should be able to live on campus again",

That\u2019s like $750 a month just for food. \n\nRoom is like $2,800 a semester. So $5,600 a year. Not as bad considering most budget apartments are $400-550 a month and a lot of people living with parents over summer. \n\nBut being able to have whoever you want over past a certain time, not pay out the ass for food, throw parties/events, parking your car, have a pet, etc is much better than on campus living.\n\nAlso upperclassmen on campus is much less interesting than freshman since most people have friends already",

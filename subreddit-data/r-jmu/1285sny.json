            "comment": "Depends on a lot of things, like what your major is, what your interests are, etc. \n\nI'll try to paint in broad strokes, starting with cons. First off, there's a really good chance that your living situation as a freshman will kinda suck. East Campus has the nicest dorms, but you have a far greater chance of living elsewhere, like the village. With no AC, which sucks when the weather gets hot. And if you don't like walking, this ain't the school for you. Hills everywhere. If you're planning on participating in the bar scene downtown, most of the bars suck and this is more of a house party school. And if you plan on bringing a car and driving to classes as you move off campus, the parking situation is an absolute nightmare. \n\nBut there are far more pros! JMU is a great school, and I loved every single professor I had. Super easy to talk to, great answering any questions I had, and genuinely wanted me to succeed. Libraries are awesome, with ECL/Rose being completed very recently and the older library, Carrier, still being very good. Both libraries also have a Starbucks in them, if you're a coffee person. The food on campus is superb. As a freshman you'll obviously be doing 95% of your eating there, but as an upperclassman having a long day on campus and eating on campus is a pleasure. Tons of options, and not just JMU campus food. There's a Denny's, Chick-Fil-A, Panda Express, and a Panera on campus in addition to the regular dining halls. I absolutely loved the area, because I'm a huge fan of the outdoors. The walks around campus I mentioned would be awful if you're not physically up to par, but for someone who loves exercise or the outdoors, those walks are a pleasure. Beautiful skies in a really pretty mountain town, with some gorgeous hikes very short drives away and more lovely places to stargaze, watch sunsets, or just chill on a hammock and read. It's also a great party school! Like I mentioned, bars kinda suck (that's a personal opinion, I have some friends that love the bars here so take my opinion with a grain of salt) but Halloweekend house parties here are great, kids from UVA and VT will come visit for that weekend because JMU does it so well. Clubs also host great parties, and frats can have some good ones too. Also great for sporting events! Students get a lot of perks, like being able to get into pretty much any game you want for free. Off campus living is very affordable, as are most things around town. Eating out is usually pretty affordable. \n\nAlso a few things that aren't really pros or cons but may be worth mentioning are that JMU is mostly a girls school, with about 60% of the student body being women, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it was higher, I haven't checked the numbers on that in a while. Another is that Harrisonburg weather can be kind of wonky, just like VA as a whole and it can be kind of weird and annoying having a 30 degree day followed by a 70 degree day during seasonal shifts (such as like March, in the transition from winter to spring). And even though this applies to most colleges, not just JMU, you will enjoy your time here much more if you make an effort to get out and do stuff, and try to make friends. Not to say that if you're introverted you'll hate it here, because an introvert could absolutely come here and have a great time if they chose to, but JMU is a very social school, with very sociable people.\n\nThat's kind of a lot, but I hope I helped you a bit. There's way more about JMU that I love, so if you want me to elaborate on anything just lmk.",

Come senior year, I realized that I had undervalued brand name recognition from more prestigious schools. There job opportunities are ok at JMU, but many are... lesser than you'll find at a more prestigious school.\n\nAlso, while there are plenty of smart folks at JMU, I also met my fair share of \"wtf how did you even get in here?\" people.\n\nOP, if you want a better pros/cons list, you should add which other schools you're looking at.",

Music is the best public east of the Mississippi if not the best public school period. Business is underrated and employers actually do see it. Some marketing recruiters skip the business school entirely and look at other majors because they want diverse experiences. There's a reason we've been moving up, and it's because our faculty is so connected with our students. Other schools are primarily research. JMU focuses on having industry experience as a professor over having doctoral degrees.",

If your complaint is jennings being far, the busses get you where you need if you time it right,  and the walk gives you nice calves.",

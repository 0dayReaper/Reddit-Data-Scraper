If you're not part of a study group that regularly meets, you're WRONG. If there isn't one, form one. It sucks for everybody, not just you! USE OFFICE HOURS. Do all of the extra work, even the shit that doesn't count towards your grade. \n\nThis will be the second hardest class you take in the COB program, put your head down and don't treat it like you would another class.",

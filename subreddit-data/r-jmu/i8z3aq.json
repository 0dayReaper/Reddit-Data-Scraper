Not to mention that I\u2019ve been here all summer and the chances of seeing anyone in a mask in public is at best 50/50. Students and locals aren\u2019t taking it seriously, so in the words of our own school \u201cpack light this year.\u201d",

            "comment": "There are locals taking it seriously, but you don't see us because we're staying inside. ;-) Seriously, though, the amount of people who are not wearing masks (or wearing them wrong) is definitely concerning. I'm really worried about what will happen when the students come back. It's not that I don't want you all here, but the increase in population is going to really spike our cases.\n\nMy experience is that it depends on where and when you go places that determine how seriously the staff and clients take COVID. Walmart is a disaster, but if you go to Martin's, Kroger or Target during off peak hours, people are more concerned with social distancing and masks. I know that those places aren't an option for all of you, but just some observations from someone who has been here all summer.\n\nI can't speak to how campus is because I haven't been back since all of this started.",

I'd say 50% of people don't cover their nose with their mask and some people are still assholes about wearing them inside stores when it's required by law here in the state.  \n\n\nJust today I witnessed a guy in his mid-late thirties, call a young college aged Asian man at the store a \"communist motherfucker\" for asking him to put a mask on before he went in.",

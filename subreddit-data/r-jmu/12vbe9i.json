    "postText": "  \n\nTo the editors and staff of The Bluestone, why would you leave out covering \u201cVirginia\u2019s Finest\u201d Marching Royal Dukes in the 2023 JMU Yearbook? The MRDs, an organization of 535 students, were excluded when much smaller clubs and sports received a two-page spread. Clubs including swing dance, bass fishing and dodgeball are all recognized. The cheerleaders and Dukettes have a spread near the football section but no recognition for the MRDs. I realize that there is not enough space for every organization at JMU but one that includes such a large percentage of students should make the cut. Dukes do better.",

Which is ESPECIALLY irritating this year because we literally went to Italy for new years to play for the Pope in January!! For our 50th season anniversary!! That\u2019s like the best opportunity for a yearbook story EVER and they didn\u2019t even know about it I assume even though it was advertised at liters every. Single. Home game. In the fall. Good grief.",

I hypothesize that it may have something to do with all the blowing into instruments, maybe it causes brains cells to die in mass due to lack of oxygen, but that's besides the point. \n\nJMU's only putting the hot &amp;/or diverse people in the yearbook that'll make the college look more attractive.",

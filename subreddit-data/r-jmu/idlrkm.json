Have a dinner party and get wasted. Go on a hike with a couple friends and shotgun beers at the top. Have a few friends over and play drinking games. Fun can still be had, people are just going to have to adjust. The only type of drinking culture being taken away is massive parties and overcrowded bars. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t like these things, but being with friends does not have to happen in the basement of a frat. To be clear, in normal circumstances I don\u2019t care how people spend their time. \n\nThe main pro for in-person classes is in-person classes. Online classes suck. My girlfriend is in a graduate program here heavy on lab work and moving online will completely water down the very expensive and time intensive program she worked hard to get into. This is a reality for many students. \n\nI do agree with you that we will likely close regardless of partying or not. But if there are huge parties and those people continue to interact in the community, when students get sent home, the local Harrisonburg community will have massive spikes in cases. It is not fair for students to use their college town as a playground to do whatever they want. The main people at risk in our area will be locals of Harrisonburg. If someone goes to a 200 person party and goes to the grocery store, they are now putting responsible individuals at risk, regardless of whether JMU closes or not",

I would like to counter, though\u2014think of the expense of college (don't even weigh it vs. the return). Just the sheer macro expense of it. Is the benefit to be at school for most students really the social scene? If that's true, is it worth paying many thousands of dollars to have a social scene? If it were, would you be satisfied? Do you have a social scene outside of school? And if not, is it worth paying thousands of dollars to have one at school?\n\nHonest questions. I posit here that the point of being in school is not the social scene. It's a really great benefit to be able to connect with peers and learn tangentially and by osmosis from being around fellow students. But I very much disagree that the benefit to be school for most students is the social scene. And for that reason, I don't think a bunch of students trying to get their 'last hurrah' in before the school is inevitably shipped to online only is a worthy reason. \n\nYou said you're against partying. That's cool, and me too in this case. I just want to respectfully challenge the view that college is about the social scene. That's a luxury that folks don't generally understand they have. The primary reason one is at a university is to learn. And if it's not, what's stopping that person from spending an exponentially smaller amount of money, if any, to have a social scene.",

Ofc online learning may be way better this semester because they actually had time to create a good plan. \nAnyways, I totally get that students want to socialize with people but why jeopardize the entire student body just to go to a massive party/parties. I\u2019d rather continue doing small laidback gatherings than going to parties. But to be fair I do like smaller gathering anyways so maybe I\u2019m a bit biased there. I would just hate to have COVID potentially spread to high risk people at a higher rate because students are going back to school. It\u2019s a horrible and unprecedented situation and I just want everyone to be safe (and have some fun ofc)",

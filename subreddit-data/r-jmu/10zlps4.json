I was accepted to JMU durning early action and have committed so I was all excited to talk to people who are going to JMU too. I do adore the idea of this website of being able to talk to people without having to give personal information. \n\nThe problem is no one seems to want to talk. I have over 20 connections but only a handful of people have responded to me, even less have continued past the first couple texts. I get that talking to new people is hard but  JMYou is a social app. Like please respond I just want to make friends. \n\nBut maybe I\u2019m the problem so what are y\u2019all\u2019s experiences with it?",

I also was very excited to use JMYou but people either used it for a short time or didn\u2019t know it existed at all. Try to go to Facebook and search for \u201cJMU Class of ####\u201d And your corresponding group should already be made. Nobody that I knew of really used JMYou to find friends/roommates. Mainly facebook",

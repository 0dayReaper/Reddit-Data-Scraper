Usually it\u2019s just one giant lease and is a little more flexible about when you can leave.\n\nDon\u2019t make the same mistake as me and sign a 12 month lease if you aren\u2019t sure if you will be here, I just graduated and am stuck with a lease until July that I no longer need.\n\nOther than that I\u2019m not sure of any actual complexes that offer short leases, find a place you like and just ask, sort of trial and error.",

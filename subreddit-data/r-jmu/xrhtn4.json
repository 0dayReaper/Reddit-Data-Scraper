    "postText": "Hello All,\n\nI was thinking about the surge of vinyl and other forms of physical media being sold in recent years. Is there much or any interest in creating a club dedicated to the discussion, exploration, and general antics of collecting these forms of media at JMU? We currently have a mixed bag of music clubs, and a radio station among other things so I can only assume that the arts and music are appreciated. Is the collecting of such and display of finds of any interest to anyone? I would gladly be open to hearing ideas as well on this if any have these. \n\nThanks!\n\nGo Dukes!",

I think that a lot of groups might mutually benefit from a niche group like this. Truly one of the ideas I had about a big event is having a Record Expo/Con on campus. I don't know how viable that idea is but I would love to get something off the ground.",

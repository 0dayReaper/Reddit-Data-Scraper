    "postText": "I am looking at SCOM 472 (Media and Politics) with Ryan Alessi, SCOM 425 (Leadership with no professor assigned yet), SCOM 453 (Political campaigns) with Dan Schill.  Any recommendations or info on these would be helpful.  Would prefer to stay away from a political class but not many 400 level options this coming fall. And not sure about taking SCOM 425 with not knowing who the professor would be and it is an 8 week condensed class. \n\nIf anyone has taken SCOM 342 (Argument and Advocacy online) or SCOM 320 (Interpersonal Communication with Nelson), I would appreciate info on those as well. Thanks.",

            "comment": "SCOM 472 with Alessi is a fantastic class; He's the freaking GOAT, and his class is very enjoyable and not too difficult. Haven't taken that class with Dan Schill yet, but I've had him for other ones that have been amazing; another GOAT professor who genuinely cares about his students and what he teaches. \n\nI also have taken 320 with Nelson, and I absolutely loved her and that class. Interesting content and she is the sweetest person ever. Definitely recommend all three of these classes if you can take them all, but you'll be happy no matter what.",

I think my class said no professor assigned as well because he only teaches that one class for 8 weeks and has a career outside of JMU, he\u2019s not a full time employee. I really really recommend taking that class. He\u2019s amazing about keeping your other classes in mind and not overwhelming his students, also just fun and a chill professor. Think I got an A in the class",

He\u2019s good about adjusting the schedule to meet everyone\u2019s needs and keep everyone chill. You\u2019re assigned a group of 3 in the beginning and they\u2019re the ones you\u2019ll do assignments with all semester. The assignments are straightforward and easy to manage. Take home midterm and final that you complete with your group.",

I finished the class with a B, but that was ridiculous. Be careful because at the end you will be taking on A LOT of work. I didnt really learn anything about leadership either.",

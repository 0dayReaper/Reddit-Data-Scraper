I\u2019m stuck deciding between Jmu and University of Delaware.  If anyone knows anything about both schools and can compare that would help.\nI heard there\u2019s a lot of partying here and I am not looking to do that too often, but maybe once in a while.  And is it easy to meet people here?",

            "comment": "Both schools seem to be comparable academically (UofD slightly higher in the rankings), so it just depends on which school you like more. JMU is big on sports and partying, but that's not all you can do.  Harrisonburg has a lot to offer like awesome hiking sites and skiing in the winter. JMU also has a lot of clubs and ECs that you can get involved in. I transferred out of JMU, but there was a lot that I liked about the school. I would say go with whichever option is cheaper, but if that doesn't matter, go with the school you feel more comfortable at (definitely tour before you attend)",

You can\u2019t go random with the roommate selection and no advisor would meet with me yet to tell me what classes I should take.  Those are the only things that really turned me away from Jmu.  (I was going to go there last year but backed out because I decided to save money my first year and go to community).",

I don\u2019t know what the curve is but I personally found that you\u2019re better off not factoring in a curve when calculating your cob gpa. You don\u2019t want to bank on something you don\u2019t know for sure is gonna happen.",

                    "comment": "Agreed, I'd say what helps even more though is taking advantage of the extra credit he gives throughout the semester. If you see a \"fun fact\" on his slides, PLEASE write it on your cheat sheet, it will almost always be the extra credit for the exam. Same with his quizzes, a majority of the time he will have literally just said word for word what the answers are right before you take them, so just keep an open ear whenever he mentions a quiz, because most of the time he tries to help you out a lot! Hope this helps.",

If you are dropping it though you have to be sure to drop it before submitting graduation paperwork etc. or you'll be marked as not having completed the program and thus not having met requirements.",

Check your academic requirements.\n\nRegardless, you must meet JMU requirements (120 credits) your degree requirements (BS, BA, BBA, BM, etc) and your program (major) requirements to graduate.",

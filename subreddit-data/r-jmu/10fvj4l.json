Pre-med is largely a d\u00e9claration of intent to complete the requirements needed to apply to medical school, including two semesters of biology, two semesters of chemistry, two semesters of physics, biochem, organic chemistry, and the accompanying labs. Which majors are you considering?  Students in different majors likely have different views on how easy it is to manage pre-med requirements.",

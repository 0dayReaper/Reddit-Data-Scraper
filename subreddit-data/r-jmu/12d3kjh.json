I don't know if or when she'll be offering it again, but it was a super easy class where you read comics (in English) and talk about how women are represented in them as well as some potential queer representation.  Highly recommend and no need for any knowledge of French!",

Reading isn\u2019t terribly difficult, usually a short story or two or equivalent before every class, and I\u2019m finding most of the reading to be pretty enjoyable",

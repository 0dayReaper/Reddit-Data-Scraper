            "comment": "Hi! Residence Life usually asks you to fill out a sort of profile about yourself to help match you with someone. Questions like if you are messy/clean, early bird/night owl, etc. I would most definitely answer them honestly rather than making it sound most appealing as it would prevent a possible future conflict with your potential roommate. Overall though, there are usually \u201cJMU Class if 20\u2013)\u201d pages on Facebook that you can refer to and see if anyone would be interested in rooming with you there. Lastly, if you know anyone from your high school that\u2019s going to JMU and wants to room with you (even if it\u2019s your bestie), I would strongly urge NOT to live with them. This is my 3rd year in Res Life and 4th year on campus and I cannot tell you the amount of people from the same high school that roomed together and end up moving out. If you have any other questions about on campus life, feel free to message me and you can always reach out to res-life@jmu.edu if you have any logistics questions. I hope this helps!",

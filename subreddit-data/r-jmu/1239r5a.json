You will have to look at [the agreement between your CC and JMU](https://www.jmu.edu/transfer/vccs-transfer/gaa.shtml). The agreement will also tell you the steps you need to apply for guaranteed admission (e.g. letter of intent).",

That being said, JMU typically looks at associates degree receivers as a big plus so assuming you don't meet GAA I think you still have a solid chance given the GPA and getting your associates.",

They're like the religious version of Alex Jones conspiracy theories; they're too ridiculous to be taken seriously. Never thought I could run into them in real life.\n\nI guess if she tries to give me one I'll just say I'm Catholic; Chick Tracts *really* don't like Catholics. Hell, one comic portrays the Church and Communists as part of a giant global conspiracy which is hilarious given the actual history between the Catholic Church and Communism (The USSR and basically all socialist regimes persecuted the Church, which ideologically opposed them in turn).",

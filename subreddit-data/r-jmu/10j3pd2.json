Also, students in the honors college can elect to live in Shenandoah Hall, which is a fairly nice dorm on east campus with A/C that is close to two dining halls (EHall and Festival), UREC (the fairly amazing student recreation center), the arboretum, the basketball arena, and shopping.",

Especially as a freshman, being in the college allows for priority enrollment which makes a massive difference in your ability to get certain classes. I didn\u2019t give in Shanendoah because I knew I had a low number for housing picks so I got my first choice anyway. That being said, if you have a lot of classes on East (like if ur a declared stem major) it\u2019s definitely a good option. Overall I think the events aren\u2019t life-changing but they can be good to participate in for a resume, and doing the capstone is great if ur going to apply to grad school. Otherwise, if you\u2019re just doing undergrad in a non-competitive major, you could probably take or leave it.",

In high school, being in the honors college sounds fantastic, but it doesn't mean anything once you're at JMU, except that you're over-eager and do extra work for no tangible pay off. There is an associated stereotype. Mild, but still there, of \"Oh yeah ha ha I'm in HONORS.\" You guys will have priority with scheduling. Being or not being in honors doesn't equal success. There are successful and unsuccessful people in both camps",

It also doesn't look like there is a direct bus or train that doesn't have three stops but I want to make sure I'm not missing any alternative options. I know there is Uber but it's 178 dollars one way :(",

This was before Uber ever existed.\n\nI\u2019d imagine there\u2019s a similar resource online today. Reach out to the student affairs office for assistance with identifying resources.",

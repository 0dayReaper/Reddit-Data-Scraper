            "comment": "Village bathrooms are suite-style but they are horrible, Skyline is community style and they're actually pretty nice, Hillside is also community style but they're older and not as nice as Skyline. Bluestone is Jack and Jill (shared with another room) but you have to clean them yourself.",

East Campus is definitely a lot quieter than Main Campus, but if anything I'd think that's a plus over Main Campus. There is so much going on a JMU at all times it's kind of hard to feel isolated unless you lock yourself in your dorm room 24/7. If you think that you may feel isolated if you choose East campus, join clubs (they'll keep you busy and are a great way to meet new people). If you're thinking between Hillside and Skyline, I would recommend Skyline because the facilities are a lot nicer than Hillside &amp; you have the best dining hall a few feet from your dorm room (literally).",

I think it\u2019s perfect for freshman because it\u2019s close to gen ed building but just a quick bus ride away from east campus.",

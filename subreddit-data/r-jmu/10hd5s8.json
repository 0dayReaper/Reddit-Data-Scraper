With that being said, I\u2019ve made it this far already, but I would like to hit UREC and lift there but I\u2019m not sure where I could park without getting a ticket? Any suggestions?",

However, it was like Friday and/or Saturday evening. Idk if I\u2019d try it during the middle of the day or a weekday.\n\nAlso, parking services can be such a dick. They gave me a ticket last year because my \u201cdecal wasn\u2019t affixed properly.\u201d There was like a tiny portion of one corner of the sticker that was just barely starting to peel off the glass\u2026whoever gave me that ticket, I hope you step on legos barefoot.",

            "comment": "I took the online course with Professor Jakeman back in the spring last year. Essentially we were given two models per two weeks.\n\nWeek 1&amp;2 involved creating an instructional design module for a specific audience as well as learning theories about technology.\n\nWeek 3&amp;4 involved the use of photoshop adobe, how to cut images and remove background objects, hue and saturation tints, etc\n\nWeek 5&amp;6 involved creating a website for information. We used wiz\n\nFor week 7, we learned how screencasting works as well as the usage of animation sites to tell a narrative or story.\n\nIf she is available, I highly recommend her. Some of the modules were really fun to play around with. Not a huge learning curve and Jakeman is always understanding of any issues you might have if you do take her. \n\nOf course, this is online and not an in lecture experience. I hope this helps",

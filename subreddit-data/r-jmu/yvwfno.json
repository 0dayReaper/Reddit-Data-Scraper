            "comment": "MATH 103 &amp; 105 are very different courses.  MATH 103 is a \u201cMath for Liberal Arts\u201d course\u2014each instructor can cover what they like (there isn\u2019t a set syllabus), so generally people teach topics that they find interesting.  Depending on who\u2019s teaching it, that could mean going into a lot of depth into a couple topics, or quickly going through a lot of topics (each week will be totally different).\n\nMATH 105 is more of a basic statistical reasoning course.  If you need to take MATH 220, but I don\u2019t have a high enough stat placement score, you\u2019ll have to take MATH 105 first.\n\nNeither of these have equivalent courses at most high schools.  MATH 155 is the college algebra course and covers stuff that people probably saw in Algebra II.",

The pre-2001 D-Hall was just a buffet, and the food was prepared in the back.  The only change that Aramark made prior to the big renovation in 2001 was adding some images of food to the walls and making some \"Pan Geos\" stands near the fire exit.  Then in 2001, they opened the kitchen area up when they renovated and did a lot of food prep out in the open.",

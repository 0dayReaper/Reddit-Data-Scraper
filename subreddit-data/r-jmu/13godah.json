    "postText": "Hey! (Incoming Freshman) I recently committed to JMU &amp; was accepted into the Honors College. I was just wondering how it all works: Will my Gen Eds look different, if so, how? What does minoring in \u201cHonors\u201d look like? and do all honors students have to minor in honors? What if I wanted to minor in something else hypothetically?",

            "comment": "Congratulations!!!\n\nFor GenEds you will be able to take honors sections of some of GenEds where you will have only honors students in your class. Not all of your GenEds will necessarily be honors, but you will have those as an option.\n\nAll students in honors declare the honors minor. You can declare additional minors if you would like. The honors minor is a way to keep track of completing your honors requirements.",

            "comment": "Honors dropout here (it just didn\u2019t work out for my major and goals.) Minoring in Honors involves 19 credit hours of Honors specific classes. You can probably cross off a lot of those credit hours through your Gen Eds and major if you plan well. If that doesn\u2019t work, there is also an \u201chonors option\u201d you can apply to a normal class with permission from the Honors college and the professor of that class, which can give you credit. It\u2019s overall very flexible, but make sure you have a 4 year academic plan made before you enroll in classes to ensure being in Honors is going to work with your Major!\n\nAdditionally, you have the option of completing an extra 6 credit hours in the form of a capstone research project or portfolio which will give you \u201cHonors Designation\u201d upon graduation. This used to be required, but this year it was changed to be optional. You can just do the minor without the capstone now.\n\nYou can definitely minor in something else. Again, reach out to your advisor and make a plan to see how those classes are going to cross over, but a lot of minors won\u2019t add a ton of classes to your work load depending on how close it is to your major.\n\nHonors overall is a good experience imo and there are a lot of perks to it (early enrollment, computer lab, honors advisors) and HON 100, which you will take in the fall, is a really great introduction to JMU and Honors.\n\nBest of luck!",

            "comment": "I'm going into my junior year as a double minor in honors &amp; pre-med, your geneds will be slightly different, because you are required to take the honors version of certain ones (ex. SCOM123H instead of SCOM123). You also will be completing a capstone project (depending on your major). It isn't terrible, but I would prepare for a heavier courseload because you will also need to take a number of seminars. congrats and feel free to reach out with any more questions! also... early enrollment is a perk of being an honors kid and its AMAZING",

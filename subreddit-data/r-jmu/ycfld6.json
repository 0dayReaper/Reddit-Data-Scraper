    "postText": "Anyone have previous experience with either Robert Horn or Nevin Cavusoglu, especially for ECON 270? Thoughts between the two options for 270? Neither seem too good considering RMP or VaGrade. For those who had either for 270, do they provide any quiz or test study prep, offer extra credit, or curve? Was the final cumulative? Use and test from text book? TIA for any comments to help deciding between the two.",

The quizzes and homework are online using access code software (it\u2019s MyLab from Pearson this semester, idk if he\u2019ll keep using it). there are 4 tests and 2 are cumulative, but the semester is broken into 2 sections, so you take a final on international trade around fall break and then a final for international finance in december. for the exams he gives a sheet that has what material will be on the exam. As for him as a professor, what you\u2019ve heard is pretty much right. He can be crude and doesn\u2019t create and environment where you feel you can ask questions. He will make you feel stupid if he feels the question is easy and you answer wrong. if you\u2019d like you can DM me and i\u2019ll send you the syllabus for his class :)",

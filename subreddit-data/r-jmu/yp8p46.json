            "comment": "hey i\u2019m in colorguard and nuance! the practice schedule for guard is monday-friday, although sometimes we get friday off if we have a good week and don\u2019t have a performance the next day. we start exactly 15 minutes earlier than the band, so be sure to plan for that when scheduling - we often get to the field 30 mins early to make sure we are all set up and ready. \nfor winter, the schedule is a lot more. we have multiple 12 hour staging camps on most saturdays and sundays nov-jan and come back a week early from winter break to practice. the weekly schedule is three 3 hour practices a week, and our competition schedule is every single saturday, with some sundays and fridays included for regionals and travel. \nit is doable to hold down a job, but it will probably have to be on campus and during the day. you will not have aton of hours to work.\nthe mrd auditions are significantly less competitive but they tend to take around 50! nuance auditions are more competitive - we had ours this past weekend and had over 60 trying out for 40ish spots.\nbalance is hard to find at first because this takes up so much time, but everyone i know has been able to make it work. if you have any questions or want more specific info (i have the winter schedules) dm and let me know! good luck :)",

I\u2019m a former MRD, and while I can\u2019t answer colorguard specific questions, I can give some insight into the broad points. \n\nRehearsal is Monday-Thursday for an hour and a half. We rehearse on Fridays when we have home football games or performances on Saturdays.  I\u2019m not sure of specific times, but from what I observed over my four years, the colorguard definitely has a culture of showing up early and also staying late to these rehearsals. \n\nDoing band and school and definitely requires time management. It can be hard at times, but looking back it was all 100% worth it to be a part of the MRDs for four years!\n\nI have some friends who did guard and would be happy to connect you with them if you\u2019re interested!",

            "comment": "hi!! i'm currently in nuance and the mrd colorguard, so i can probably answer some questions :) our practice schedule for mrds is monday-friday typically between the hours of 5-8pm, so those hours will have to be blocked off from taking classes. earlier classes will be your best friend!! for nuance, you're going to be booked every weekend from essentially november through about mid april, on top of regular 3 hr. weekday rehearsals 3x a week leading up to competitions. it sounds like a lot, and it is! but it is entirely possible to hold down a job on top of classes and still do colorguard! you just have to have good time management! there has been and are currently tons of people in the guard that have jobs, manage classes, manage other clubs, and still have time for guard, so it is 100% possible.\n\nauditions are somewhat competitive, more-so for the MRDs. the MRDs can only accept up to 50 people onto one giant team, so they are looking for more technical spinners. it is also extremely fast-paced, so they need people that can pick up choreography quicker! for nuance, there's two different teams that are a division apart, which makes it perfect for both beginners and advanced spinners. this year we had over 60(?) people audition for nuance and there's 27 people on our Open team and 22 people on our A team. it's a great mixture of people of all skill levels, which is the best part about it!\n\nmy freshman year, i definitely struggled to balance everything... but the people on the colorguard make it entirely worth it. i have made the best friends of my life doing this sport at JMU, and they are my lifeline. every time i feel overwhelmed, they are there to support me in any way i need, whether it be studying with me, helping me with homework, practicing with me, etc. i definitely recommend giving it a try! hope we get to meet one day &lt;3",

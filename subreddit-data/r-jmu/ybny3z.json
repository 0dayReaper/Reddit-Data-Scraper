So I wanted to ask where are good places to start looking for apartments and where are possible places to look for roommates? Apartments that sort randomly would also work.",

            "comment": "I lived at The Mill for three years and would recommend it. Cheap, utilities included, a nice kitchen and living area (with a tiny bedroom and shared bathroom). It\u2019s close enough to campus that I was able to bike to school. \n\nI was fortunate enough to be in a unit they had originally used to show off their units, so it was in pretty good shape when I moved in. I\u2019ve heard not-so-great stories of other units. We never had major issues, but repairs were done quickly.\n\nUpper management is a clown show and you\u2019ll see a revolving door of \u201ccommunity managers\u201d in the leasing office and it will be closed at times if they are having trouble finding someone. I got to know like four of them and they all ended up saying their boss was awful. That said, this really didn\u2019t affect my living arrangement any so\u2026\n\nAlso it\u2019s three other roommates, so unless you\u2019re living with friends each year potentially gives you three new strangers. The I met the future best man at my wedding and also met the worst roommate I\u2019ve ever experienced so it\u2019s a mixed bag lol",

But management issues don\u2019t really impact the cheapness of price or distance to campus, which were far more important to me. If not the Mill I might also recommend Madison Gardens!",

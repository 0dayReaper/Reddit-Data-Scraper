They are both basic classes that focus on mildly different things- 195 is more based on culture and the discipline of anthropology itself. Anth 196 focuses more on the evolution of humans (specifically looking at the fossil record). I enjoyed 196 way more than 195. They don't rely on each other so it doesn't matter which one you take first.",

Since they\u2019re both intro classes for the major and don\u2019t overlap with each other as the other comment said, it doesn\u2019t matter what order you take them in as long as you take them all. The only time it may be an issue is if you also wanted to take a higher level cultural ANTH class that usually requires you to have taken 195 already.",

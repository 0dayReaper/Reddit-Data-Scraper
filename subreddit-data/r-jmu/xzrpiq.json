The announcers would mention our team's bios, and a lot of them already had undergrad degrees, or \"played 5 seasons at blah blah blah\" state. I always understood the eligibility limits to be 4 years - 5 if a player is a redshirt freshman. \n\nAre we exploiting some weird eligibility loophole going from FCS to FBS and whipping other schools' asses because we're fielding 24 year-olds vs 18 and 19 year-olds?",

Plus you're allowed to graduate transfer (go to grad school somewhere else) for a 5th year of eligibility if you want. 5 years + the covid year = 6-year seniors.",

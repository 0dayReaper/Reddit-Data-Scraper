I\u2019m an incoming freshman and wanted to get an insight (pros and cons). I\u2019m also planning on majoring in CIS, so if Honors benefits that in any way lemme know :)!",

            "comment": "Since it\u2019s a minor, there are a decent amount of credits to get done for it. You can take your Gen Ed\u2019s as Honors Gen Ed\u2019s, which essentially gives you smaller class sizes. Then you have seminars, which are professors talking about whatever cool topic they enjoy (they\u2019re usually more discussion based). They are having some change in curriculum requirements, so I\u2019d check the website and make sure it sounds feasible for you. I def agree the classes aren\u2019t hard (most I\u2019ve taken have been easier than my normal Gen Ed\u2019s). \n\nPros: access to smaller classes, access to basement of Hillcrest House for studying, community events, access to certain study abroad\u2019s like the Oxford semester, live in the honors dorm if you\u2019re an incoming freshman. Ability to complete undergraduate research. Advanced registration, free printing. \n\nCons: smaller classes = limited number of seats, I\u2019ve had difficulty spacing out my honors classes over the years, limited number of advisors so getting help is a bit tricky, they\u2019ve changed the curriculum three times in my two years so not everyone in the college has had the same experience. Not a very connected community, outside of the dedicated few students who do an amazing job helping the college function. \n\nCapstone: the final project of the honors experience is either an undergraduate research thesis or a portfolio review. I did the thesis, so I can\u2019t speak to the portfolio review (would welcome other thoughts!). For the thesis, it\u2019s three semesters of research, writing, and whatever else you need to turn in the final document. It\u2019s meant to prepare you for graduate-level research, and you also get to display &amp; present your work publicly at the Honors Symposium. It was definitely a lot, but I loved my topic and got to do a lot of cool things that I would never have been able to do otherwise - and I\u2019d never considered myself a research person before. \n\nA lot of people join the honors college for the pros but end up dropping their junior year because they don\u2019t want to do the capstone/feel the honors college didn\u2019t really give them what they were expecting. That\u2019s fine if it\u2019s something you realize later on, but coming in intending to drop is a waste of your time &amp; money as you\u2019re attending classes that are taking away from other things you could be studying. \n\nThe only reason I joined was for the thesis, but if it hadn\u2019t been for that I probably also would have dropped b/c I never felt connected to the community of honors &amp; I was really expecting a more challenging curriculum. The classes I\u2019ve taken have been fascinating, but not what I though would be \u2018honors level\u2019. I\u2019ve certainly taken harder Gen Ed\u2019s or seen my friends not in the Honors College doing far more rigorous things.  I\u2019d do it all again for my thesis, but I didn\u2019t get anything else out of it. I always tell incoming freshman that if the honors college curriculum/experience matches your academic goals, then go for it! But you shouldn\u2019t apply just because you did honors in high school or feel it\u2019s just what you \u2018have\u2019 to do. \n\n(Also, unless it\u2019s being changed, you can join the Honors College after your freshman year - that\u2019s what I did! So you can arrive and see for yourself if it\u2019s worth it.) \n\nBest of luck in CIS &amp; enjoy freshman year!",

Also quite a few of the honors curriculum requirements, like the diversity/experiential classes, have options that seem to overlap with other things like major requirements, so the honors curriculum has not felt overwhelming (at least for me).",

I had one 400 level honors class that was basically a guaranteed A as long as you showed up and turned in your work. On the other hand, I also had one that made me consider dropping out of college all together.\n\nI entered as a transfer, so some of my honors credits came from my previous school. That made it considerably easier. \n\nI had some good experiences with the Honors College, but it probably wasn't necessary. It was mostly a personal sense of accomplishment.",

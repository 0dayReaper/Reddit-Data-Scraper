Everyone I knew in a fraternity at JMU eventually began to see it as an annoying obligation more than anything else.\n\ngreek life doesn't have the same weight at JMU as UVA, you can easily have a great social life without it and you aren't going to make the same professional connections as you would elsewhere.  At UVA, your brother's dad might get you an internship at Goldman, at JMU you might get an internship at Lincoln Property Management.",

The only time some of the obligations get annoying is your senior year, but the annoying stuff is usually a couple days out of the semester and most of being part of a fraternity is lot of fun. Also, professional benefits isn\u2019t the only benefits from joining, my best friends are my pledge brothers. Obviously, though you can have a great social life without joining a fraternity, it\u2019s just a different way of going about things and it may not be the right fit for everybody.",

In addition to the points you raised about obligations, my fraternity was extremely selective about non-fraternity guys coming to our parties. A few select people, typically non-fraternity roommates of fraternity brothers, would get a free pass to come to parties, but that was extremely rare.",

    "postText": "first of all, this past few years of jmu students have been great and i feel like the townie/student divide is finally ending. as i said, im a local bartender at a bar downtown and i know a lot of y'all are new to bars/ bar etiquette so here's so tips to receive the best service: \n1. understand what a tab is\n\n* if we ask if you want to start a tab that means we will swipe your card and give it back and in our computer system your last name will appear and your drinks will be listed underneath, you can \"close out\" your tab when you want to leave\n\n*there is no reason to tell us you want to \"open and close\" you can just say you want to just cash out\n\n*saying you want to \"pay your tab\" means you have one started with all your other drinks on it so just say you'd like to cash out if you don't have a tab running \n\n2. please try to order ALL your drinks at once, if you want three lemon drops, a long island and four Malibu's and we make it and come back to you and you want to add another two lemon drops you will likely be waiting awhile because we have already taken someone else's order and there is a line \n\n3. there's a line and i see you and i will get to you, i promise. if you interrupt us it will slow everything down. \n\n4. IF YOU EVER FEEL IN DANGER OR UNCOMFORTABLE PLEASE TELL US, we will take care of the situation. we want everyone to feel welcome in our bars so if a person is being creepy or phobic then let us know. \n\n\nthank you guys \u2764\ufe0f hope this helps someone and y'all rule \n\n-secret townie bartender",

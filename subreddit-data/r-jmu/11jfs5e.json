    "postText": "Hey guys so I have a couple questions which I\u2019m hoping will be easy to answer:\n\nI got deferred from JMU during EA and I\u2019m currently waiting for regular decision. I\u2019m pretty much fully committed to JMU but just had a phew questions. \n\n*Should I send in a letter of continued interest? (I sent my updated transcript btw)\n\n*When should I typically expect to hear back from JMU (mid-March or early April)\n\n*Also is it true that most deferrals turn into an acceptance? \n\nThanks! :)\n\n(I have a 3.6 GPA, lots of extra curricular, president of MUN, 3 AP//mixed honors etc)",

Might as in if the school you graduated from also has everyone in your graduating class applying to JMU, the odds might be a bit difficult. However, I've met *a lot* of people who got deferred and then accepted, so keep your head up!",

I did that after I was deferred from EA a couple of years ago and heard feedback almost immediately. I was accepted at regular decision. Good luck!",

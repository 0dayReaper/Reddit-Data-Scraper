    "postText": "I plan on doing my masters in biotech and so will do my bachelors in either bio or biotech. I am an in-state student in terms of tuition but currently I live abroad for family reasons and so could be considered international in terms of ethnicity. Will be posting this in the subs of both schools, there's a tldr at the end too.\n\nHere are some of the things I'm considering:\n\nAffordability: I know w&amp;m is considered expensive and I haven't yet heard back about aid, however it's really important for my family that i receive a good package as my family has multiple dependents. the aid i'm getting at jmu is alright and the tuition is definitely lower than w&amp;m's from my approximation of their tuition.\n\nHonors college: I've been accepted to the honors college at JMU. However, I know that w&amp;m is a very academically strong school and so will the school itself outweigh the benefits of the honors college at jmu?\n\nFood: I'm a vegetarian and so I need to know that whichever school I go to, i have actual meal options; JMU is appealing for me in that aspect as i've heard their food ratings are quite good.\n\nweather: I honestly am fine with any weather but if there's a significant issue at either of these schools i'd prefer knowing beforehand\n\nMajor: jmu has the biotech major I want, but biology is also an acceptable major for me. however i've been told the bio major at w&amp;m is very saturated and hard to score well in\n\nSocial life: i've been at a boring high school and so am really looking for a change and to have a more social college life, maybe not at an extreme but i'd enjoy going to parties\n\nUndergrad research: I want to be doing research asap in my undergrad as i want to have a career in medical research, which school would be providing more opportunities for that?\n\nDiversity: has anyone ever faced a problem as a POC at either of these schools? and if anyone could give an idea of lgbtq+ acceptance in general at these schools\n\nTLDR: Asking for a comparison and advice about the cost, academics, food, weather, major, research opportunities, social life, diversity, etc between w&amp;m and jmu",

They\u2019re known for being very competitive because W&amp;M pits students against each other academically and in a job this doesn\u2019t go well for team environments. JMU students are known to be very good in work environments and many people get hired over other candidates because companies have such a good experience with JMU grads. -my ex\u2019s mom was a hiring manager for a major company.",

So if the only thing pushing you one way or another is a \"perceived prestige\" than I would certainly reconsider the other factors.\nI am not as familiar with JMU's honor college, but I would strongly recommend the Trelawney community at JMU as it will set you up to be performing meaningful undergraduate Bio/BioTech research as a Freshman and beyond. I'm not as familiar with research opportunities at W&amp;M, but know that JMU does an excellent job at getting undergraduates involved in research, especially compared to many R1 institutions where research is primarily performed by PhDs/post-docs.\nI think most people on the subreddit will tell you that JMU's food and culture are great but those are a bit more subjective than some of the other things you asked.",

Plus many companies like to hire JMU students due to the research opportunities offered. I personally didn\u2019t participate in research with a professor but know some people who did and they enjoyed it and depending on the professor you can even get published in a journal for your work. Even some of the courses provide opportunities for research, such as viral discovery if they still have that, it\u2019s bacteriophage related research and there are two parts one is more lab based and the other is computer based for labeling the genomes of the bacteriophage and the genomes get published and you can have your name on that it\u2019s a good resume builder. I also appreciate the multitude options for upper level courses you can really focus on what you want to do that way",

Many labs I visited with VABio did express that they like to hire JMU Students due to the research experience we have even just from the normal courses not necessarily research outside of class. There are a lot of options honestly. I will say finding a lab job is a little difficult for decent pay, many lab positions do not pay too well but the jobs at Merck pay decently I\u2019ve heard and the contractor jobs do as well. I literally applied to so many jobs just to find anything, many you find on indeed aren\u2019t actual jobs I don\u2019t think because you will never hear back in any capacity.  I personally didn\u2019t enjoy lab work a whole lot and did not seek that out for post grad employment. I currently work in laboratory accreditation, which is basically making sure labs are following the rules based off of an international standard and makes it so data is accurate coming from any accredited lab anywhere in the world.",

He\u2019ll probably publicly belittle someone in your class at some point. Holds some pretty unrealistic expectations of his students. Just do your work and keep your head down. Macro itself isn\u2019t that bad but I can only imagine Horn would make it 10x worse. If you can, find another professor or take the class in a different semester. If not, good luck, you\u2019re gonna need it.",

I had him last semester for 200, the man's extremely cranky since he's been teaching at JMU since literally the late 70s.\n\nOne time he asked a question to the class and didn't get an answer so he borderline yelled \"if none of you pull out your [REDACTED] calculators in the next ten seconds i'm going to start kicking you all from this room\" and then refused to say if our answers were right until we yelled them out\n\nAlso yeah he does single students out like the other comments say.\n\nGood luck with whatever you choose tho",

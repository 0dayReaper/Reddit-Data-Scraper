            "comment": "Honestly it sucked. They paid absolute minimum wage, and I only ever had two people, one who only showed up to the first one, and one who never needed help so we just talked for an hour once a week. Then for the spring semester I had no one. A lot of work for a $20 paycheck twice a month and not worth even the risk of parking imo",

But thank you for ur insight!!",

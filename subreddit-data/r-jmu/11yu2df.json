    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019m currently a freshman at VT and have been considering transferring to JMU as I have tons of close friends and don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve found my place here. Does anyone have experience with JMU\u2019s Chem department and STEM in general? I feel like emotionally I\u2019d be happier at JMU with my friends and extracurriculares (guard) there, but maybe my academics would be better here? Looking for insight into students familiar with JMU! Thanks!",

            "comment": "Hey! I think transferring could be a great decision for you. I was in the chem dept and while it is an R2 to tech's R1, ALL of the research in chem is done by undergraduates. This means no working under a grad student or a ta, a better chance to publish, and all the chem courses are taught by faculty rather than grad students. If you're sticking with stem, Jmu is a GREAT choice :)",

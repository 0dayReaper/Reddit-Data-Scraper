    "postText": "I have an apartment available to sublease starting this January. The apartment is in the southview apartment complex. There are currently myself (male) and two other guys living in the apartment. The roommates are not loud and are generally good roommates. My rent is currently $474 per month (I'd assume the sublease would be the same but the lease would technically be through the Southview apartments so it may be slightly higher). If anyone is interested, please send me a direct message.",

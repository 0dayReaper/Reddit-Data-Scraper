Those 2 psyc classes will almost be certainly be on the quad, probably in Miller where the Psych building is. But you\u2019ll also probably take math/scom/wrtc/history which is also quad, and a few sciences which are quad. My Psyc 160 class was in Engeo on east, so I\u2019d always recommend village because it\u2019s so central",

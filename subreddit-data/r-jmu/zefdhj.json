    "postText": "So my grandparents, few aunts/uncles and parents plan on making it to my graduation next weekend. Around 10 people. I live in student housing with 3 roommates on the 3rd floor so unfortunately I can\u2019t bring them to my apt. I don\u2019t want to be inconsiderate to my roommates. We\u2019re making reservations at a restaurant for lunch but afterwards they would like to chat and just be marry. Few family plan on getting hotels (for Friday) but I\u2019m not sure those can hold like 10 ppl in 1 room. Is there an event-space we can rent/book?",

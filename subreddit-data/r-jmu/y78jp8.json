    "postText": "This might seem like a really strange request, but does anyone have the syllabus from PHIL 120 with William Knorpp? I took the class back in 2020, and I need detailed course information in order to apply for an exemption from another class at the university I go to now, but I don't have the syllabus anymore. If you could send it to me you'd be a lifesaver!",

They offer very few parking passes to first years and only if they have an ODS accommodation and are living on campus, or if you live near the area, have already gotten approved from residence life to NOT live on campus, and have contacted parking services regarding your pass. I\u2019m not exactly sure how the first year pass works but those are the only two scenarios that I have seen first years getting a parking pass.",

Once you sign up and pay for the semester they\u2019ll send you a pass to place on your dashboard when leaving the car in the lot. It\u2019s not too far a way, I usually take an Uber to the lot or you can wait for the shoppers bus line to get to it (It\u2019s adjacent to the Harrisonburg Target parking lot).

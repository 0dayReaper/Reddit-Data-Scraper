I consider it being efficient.  If I have already done what is substantially the same assignment for another course, I see no reason to reinvent the wheel, and thus I see nothing wrong with recycling my existing work to meet the new assignment's guidelines.  It's not copyright infringement, because I hold the copyright to the original work and the new work, and so it's mine to do with it as I wish.  It's also not plagiarism if I'm still citing all of my sources in the new assignment.  If the work that I submit is my own work and meets all of the requirements, even if it is recycled from an older assignment, it should be no problem.  Otherwise, as I see it, the problem is with the professor, who is upset that you didn't write a paper specifically *for them*, and instead drew from your own library of existing work.\n\nI had a Spanish teacher in high school who was weird like that.  We had four years of Spanish in my high school, and I took it quite seriously.  In order to make sure that I had all of the words that the next textbook might expect me to know, before I had to turn each earlier book in, I sat down with the book at my computer over a weekend and copied down all of the vocabulary in the chapters that we never got to in each class, and put it in a dedicated Spanish vocabulary binder for my own later reference.  What I didn't know prior to starting the class was that Spanish IV used the exact same textbook as Spanish III, but started further back in the book.  Therefore, her assignments, which involved copying down all of the vocabulary for each chapter, had been done several months prior on my own in the interest of completeness.  Rather than be pleased that I had done my homework as assigned, she took it as a challenge to her authority, and made a big stink about it.  I ultimately won that battle, because it was exactly the assignment that she wanted, but her whole argument was essentially that she was upset that I was able to run off a copy in seconds because I had already done the work for myself ahead of time.  In other words, it was never about the assignment, or about learning Spanish.  Rather, it was about toiling specifically *for her*.  I saw nothing wrong with what I did, because the material was still learned, and it just happened to be the case that I had done the exact work ahead of time, for myself, so why not use it for credit when it fit the bill exactly.\n\nThen in real life, of course, you're going to recycle existing work when it fits the bill.  Whenever I've applied for jobs that wanted a writing sample, I never write a new piece specifically for them, because that's not going to be a realistic example of what work from me looks like.  Similarly, I'm not going to waste my time writing something new for a company when I may never hear from them.  Rather, I will take an existing piece of work that I have already published, cite where it came from with full URL, possibly edit it to meet space requirements (and note where passages have been removed for space), and submit it.  If you want your own commissioned piece, show me that you're serious about hiring me by bringing me in for an interview or two, and then we'll talk.",

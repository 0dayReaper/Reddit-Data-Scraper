    "postText": "It's been barely 20 minutes since the tickets went on sale but student tickets for the game vs. Texas State have already been sold out (you get a message saying that there are no tickets available at this time), just out of curiosity has anyone else ran into this problem?\n\nEdit: Just went back to try again and it you get redirected to general tickets instead of student tickets, I've also sent out an email to the ticketing office for more info and will update when I get more info",

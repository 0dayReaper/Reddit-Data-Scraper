            "comment": "Bluestone is about as far as you can get from the business school, and is very far from UREC as well. It is closest to Dhall though. If you want proximity to the business school and UREC, go for village. It\u2019s right in the center and is under a 5 min walk to Dhall and you only need to cross one street to get to business or UREC!",

Would not recommend living in a bluestone if you\u2019re a cis major! If you don\u2019t like the village maybe skyline area? You could ride your bike and get to business building relatively fast and avoid the stairs!",

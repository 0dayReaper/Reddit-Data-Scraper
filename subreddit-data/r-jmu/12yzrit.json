Choose a major in which you will perform best and get the best GPA if med school is still on the horizon.\n2. Finish pre-reqs as early as possible so you can figure out if this is the path for you and leave room to schedule MCAT studying. It's a whole beast on its own. r/Mcat and r/premed are invaluable resources.",

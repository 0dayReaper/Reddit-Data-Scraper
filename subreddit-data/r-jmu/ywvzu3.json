    "postText": "I\u2019m a senior in nova and currently Jmu is my top school. I currently have a 3.5 weighted, I have taken 6 aps, one dual-enrolled class with Jmu and have played two varsity sports the past 3 years. I am in multiple clubs, honor society president, have a job that I work 20 hours a week and volunteer regularly. I have been admitted into Umw already.  \n\nI plan to apply reg but my current issue is that I am taking a lower level math class than everyone else. Jmu requires that a math above algebra 2 and I am currently in algebra 2. I will take an SAT in Dec and hopefully get an okay score. \n\nMy counselor and career specialist have told me that Jmu is a reach or target just because of my math scores. I have been overthinking about this for the past 3 months:,) \u2026. Stressed plz help",

Your personal statement is what tells your story and is what makes you unique from the rest of the applicants! I had a friend who took a couple APs was sitting just below a 3.5, didn\u2019t have many extra curriculars, and got in. That personal statements sets you aside from other applicants :)\nGood luck &lt;3",

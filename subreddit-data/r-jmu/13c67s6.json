There\u2019s definitely a Facebook page somewhere for incoming freshmen looking for roommates where people post their information and you can reach out to them. There\u2019s also probably an Instagram account that does a similar thing to Facebook. Several different methods you can try, good luck!",

If you\u2019re a night owl, you want another night owl that won\u2019t be in bed by 10 and get angry at you for staying up. If you\u2019re a person who keeps their room pretty tidy you\u2019ll want someone else who has similar habits, etc. You also should plan ahead on which dorm you wanna live in and find someone who wants something similar. On the housing system there should be an area where you can fill out general things about you plus a description and you\u2019ll be matched with people who have similar things put down. It\u2019ll probably be a little awkward talking to them until you two actually live together, but good luck finding someone!",

I made it a rule-of-thumb to never leave dishes in my room or the sink, no matter how busy or tired I was. \n\nChores, just vacuum, dust, mop, clean bathrooms every other week; and clean the kitchen every time you use it.\n\nKeep a track of what food you have in the fridge if it\u2019s shared, you don\u2019t want expired stuff taking up space\n\nIf they have guests over just read the room and expect your roommate to do the same. Don\u2019t me my roommate who joined me and my girlfriend (without asking) for nice home-cooked dinner I prepared lol",

I also went there specifically to get my brakes replaced because I thought I needed it, and they said I didn\u2019t and recommended a way cheaper service to address the issue I had instead. Saved me a bunch of money, and I very much trust them.",

I used to be a mechanic and my grandma was big on taking things there whenever I didn't have time, I eventually realized they were constantly screwing her. \n\nAlso once I stopped working as a mechanic, I took my car there for a state inspection and they said it failed because the headlights were illegal(they weren't) and the front brake pads failed, and they said they couldn't tell me whether the rotors were thick enough to machine because they wouldn't measure that until they take the pads off to replace. You're supposed to measure rotors as part of the state inspection. I told them I'd do the brakes myself and tried to tell them that my headlights were smoked from the factory and are DOT, and as long as they say DOT and aren't smoked after the fact then they're legal. They just kept arguing with me about the headlights and I gave up cause I needed to do the brakes anyway. Got new brake pads and when I went to replace them the old weren't even close to failing. I should've called Trooper Kile but I just let it go and told my family to stop going there. Everyone listened but my grandma until later I realized ways they were screwing her and explained it to her. \n\nI'd recommend Rice Tire u/machipongo if you don't know how to do it yourself. If you were able to do it yourself I'd suggest doing that and taking the rotors to O'Reilly's to have them machined. It's only $10 and usually they don't even actually charge me. If you replace the pads without replacing or machining the rotors there's a good chance they'll squeak, but most shops will lie because they don't have a brake lathe and say that rotors nowadays are too thin to machine.",

If Precision Tune Auto is still down South Main off Pleasant Hill, they were great for larger repairs. I did some stupid things to my first car and they were great with reasonable rates - would tell you honestly if after-market parts were realistic or available for your car/issue.",

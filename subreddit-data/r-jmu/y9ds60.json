    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI'm a Marshall grad coming to jmu on Saturday for the football game. I was hoping that someone could provide advice on parking. I don't mind paying, but want to be relatively close and definitely have a spot. I'm planning on arriving at 2:30 (1 hour prior to kickoff). \n\nThanks!",

Just about every lot in close proximity to the stadium is closed for pass holders in my prior experience (I\u2019m a band kid and we have to park at Warsaw and walk for Friday rehearsal as well as Saturday games)",

You can always check the JMU parking site for the number of available spots in each deck. Have fun at the game!",

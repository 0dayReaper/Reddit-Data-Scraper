    "postText": "Dr. Terry Beitzel passed away on the 29th of January due to COVID complications. I\u2019m asking everyone to please take CDC and COVID precautions seriously because we\u2019ve lost a great Duke, teacher, friend, and neighbor. He was only 53 but had so much more to give to the JMU and Hburg community. \n\nThe most crummy part about all of this is the fact that JMU hasn\u2019t even sent out a mass email acknowledging his death. Please continue to be mindful and remember that COVID is nothing short of being serious.",

It's hit the JMU community more than many realize. There have been things on JMU's various social media channels about these instances and some web pages have been created by different departments.",

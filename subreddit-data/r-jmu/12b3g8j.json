    "postText": "I'm relatively new to the Harrisonburg area and know I'm kinda late to the game. Does anyone know any safe and clean/reliable 1 bed/1 bath apartments around? I know I'll probably end up random roommate matching by the end of the semester but getting my own apartment is ideal. I'm looking to move in July/August, so any pointers would be greatly appreciated!",

I don't mind noise that much considering it's a beautiful unit and my dorm got me used to noise, but is there anything else I should look out for? The rent for Phase 2 is so high so I just want to make sure I'm not going in blind- I can put up with a lot as long as it's not mold, bugs, or crazy dangerous maintenance problems",

It is a 4 person apartment but each person has their own bedroom and bathroom, so you'd only be sharing a common room and a kitchen. Would that work for you?",

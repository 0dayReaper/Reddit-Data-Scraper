There are non-audition ensembles that meet twice a week that are one credit.\n\nAre you a senior and want a cool experience? Scuba has got you covered. Its only 7 weeks and I had a BLAST. You\u2019re not even required to get certified if you don\u2019t want to pay the money for getting certified over the summer.\n\nOther than that, got any 3 credit classes with a 4 credit alternative? I know thats a ton of work but thats another option",

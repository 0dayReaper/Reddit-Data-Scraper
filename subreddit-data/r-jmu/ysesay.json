Macro also isn\u2019t the easiest class for everyone but the way Nevin structures her class makes it a lot easier to understand, typically you have a smart book and homework assignment for each chapter and a test for every three chapters you learn. Overall I\u2019d say she is probably one of the better choices",

Super sweet and always has interesting stories that relate to what we are learning about in class and shows real implications of the material. The examples we go over in class are very similar to what is on the exam and she posts them on Canvas so I would recommend printing them out before class and writing notes on them because they will be super helpful when it comes to studying. Some people say the exams are hard but they\u2019re really not too bad if you go to class and pay attention. I would also recommend at least skimming through the textbook chapter before she starts going over it in class that way you already have a little bit of background on what she will be lecturing on. That\u2019s what I did and I have done good on the exams so far. Nevin is always open to help you and regularly changes/adds office hours to be best available to her students.",

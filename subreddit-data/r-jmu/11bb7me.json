    "postText": "I know that they're accepting about 220 out of maybe 300 applicants. My GPA is 2.4 but I have experience with graphic design, wrote a really good application letter, and my application stuff on Canvas was also really good so I feel confident about that. I also mentioned in my letter that I'm a junior (idk what I'm gonna do if I'm not accepted) and idk if that'll affect my chances. I'm actually hyperventilating over this, I just want to know whether I got in because I don't want to leave my friends here and go back to my abusive parents",

I won\u2019t lie, your GPA won\u2019t be helping your cause but if you\u2019re application letter is strong and you maintain at or above a B, you\u2019ve got solid chances to beat the 80 others.",

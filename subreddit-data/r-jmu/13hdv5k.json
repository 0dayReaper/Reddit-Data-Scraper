I\u2019d recommend either A wing or B wing depending on what gender they assign for each. 2/3 floors are better because there\u2019s less foot traffic. The best view will be on the field side, but you only have one window and you won\u2019t see much.",

All hillside dorms have ac, as well as a few others as well but its a long list of which ones have and don\u2019t have it. Mcgraw long faces the tennis courts, hillside field, and d-hub (if its still there, haven\u2019t been back in a while)",

Annoying because no elevator and kitchen and laundry room were on the first floor so if you\u2019re on the top you\u2019ll have to do 6 flights of stairs whenever you want to use either of those",

I lived in MGL and while the walk from the building to the union (there\u2019s a slight hill) sucks, it\u2019s right by the parking lot, has AC, new floors, good furniture, and if you live in 1C then you\u2019re right at the service car parking lot (great for groceries, door dashes, etc)",

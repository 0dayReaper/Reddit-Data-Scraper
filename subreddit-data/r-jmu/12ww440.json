Her second choice was UMW, but decided against it mainly because of size and majors offered, but besides that really liked the feel. Just seems like a place where everyone is welcome, a bit like JMU, but less school sprit because it's just so small. CNU was a good option academically, but seemed very stiff, almost military.  Definitely a commuter school, most students leave all weekends, not much going on,  but decent safety wise, majors offered. Not bad if you don't want much of a social life. ODU is big, didn't feel safe, it fell off our list pretty early, so I don't know too much about it. Definitely the easiest to get into in our experience.",

Talking to a couple of random students,  UMW kids seemed most content with their overall experience, more to do in the area surrounding campus too.",

            "comment": "Of all the differences, student demographics are probably the biggest difference. I graduated from JMU last year, and I'm doing my masters at ODU now. \n\nMany students don't live close to campus like at JMU. People come from all of the surrounding cities. Many students also don't spend a lot of time on campus. They come to class, then go to work or home.\n\nThere's also a lot of students who are completely online. I've taken most of my classes this way. I don't feel as strong a need to be involved on campus, at least for my course only masters program. It's also hard to justify driving for 45m-1hr each way for what I'd get out of it. \n\nThe students also come from all walks of life. There's freshmen out of high school, working adults with families, graduate students, and plenty of military affiliated students. \n\nJMU serves mostly young, full time, residential students who *aren't* from the local area. That being said, there's still a vibrant community of young, full time, on campus students at ODU. It's just not the entire identity of the school like JMU. \n\nODU is a more prominent option for students from Hampton Roads because it's a good value for commuters.",

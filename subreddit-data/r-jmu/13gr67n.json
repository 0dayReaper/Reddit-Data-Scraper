I\u2019m an incoming music education major and just submitted my application for the Arts RLC with hopes of staying in Wayland for the practice rooms. Is just applying for the Arts RLC and signing my housing contracting the only criteria to have a higher chance of staying in Wayland? Are there any other resources I should take advantage of? Thank you",

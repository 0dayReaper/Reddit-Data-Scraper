I planned my schedule according to my finals schedule months ago, and just now they're expecting students to casually clear their schedules? if this is true they better have an online option or smth, its not fair to those who can't stay longer than they were initially told",

I'm truly sorry if it messes with your plans, that sucks, but not knowing the policies doesn't mean they are being sprung on you or that your faculty member needs to accommodate you. I hope it works out.",

Final exam week has always been adverstised to students as December 10th-16th, and with graduation on Saturday the 17th i don't understand how they could force students to attend an in person exam on Saturday. I know Saturday makeup days have been common for regularly scheduled class cancellations in the past, but with traveling and graduation during finals week I don't think they could force Saturday exam attendance with only 2 days prior communication.",

The entire conservative playbook is built around making shit up, yelling it into a megaphone, and benefiting from the collateral damage you cause. Facts and reason don't matter to people who are in the thrall of their ignorance, and besides conservative leaders are happy to knowingly lie until they're blue in the face. JMU could show support for LGBT community members by taking away the megaphone in this instance. The \"boohoo free speech\" fallout will come as long as even one person doesn't lay down and take this shit anyway so why not make trans kids feel safe?",

Being civil and engaging in debate with those who argue in bad faith is a waste of time.

Do you think that Hitler was like \"I'm fascist\"? No one identifies as a fascist, it's not like being a libertarian or leftist or something. Fascism is loosely defined as a nationalistic political ideology focused on ethno-nationalism, military supremacy, intertwined faith and government, and rigid gender roles (and homophobia/transphobia) among other things. Wonder how many of these things Wheeler agrees with. Fascists also used ~alternative facts~ and the media to control the narrative and spread fear about \"the other\", which is kind of Wheeler's whole thing. She literally calls trans people \"groomers,\" equating them with pedophiles.",

Why aren't any conservatives sounding off about THAT? Also, you can enlist in the military at 17, potentially dying in a war before you can drink. Approximately 64% of veterans coming back from Iraq believe that the war was not worth fighting. In contrast,  only ~1% of teenagers and adults regret their transition. Gender affirming care for minors, which is usually in the form of totally reversible puberty blockers, results in better outcomes for these kids (fewer suicides, decreased depression). Studies have shown this again and again. Also, the supposed advantage \"biological men\" have against \"biological women\" in sports is not clear cut or even demonstrable in all cases. Cisgender women have been barred from competing unless they take medication to lower their natural testosterone levels! That'd be like barring Michael Phelps from competing unless he somehow shortened his wingspan. Why are SOME biological advantages okay, but not others? \ud83e\udd14 Could it be that some people's ideas of male and female are reductive and not reflective of reality?!\n\nIf Wheeler wanted to have a conversation or actually cared about trans youth she'd look at studies or LISTEN to trans people. But that's not what's happening. Instead she's sounding off about how gender affirming care is mutilation and how trans people are groomers. Shes not saying this shit in good faith, if she was her arguments would actually address reality. Shes just making a buck off bigots who already hate trans people. Which is transphobic.",

What they don't realize is that tolerance is a social contract, not a moral standard, i.e. \"You need to be tolerant to all individuals and all ideologies no matter what\". Tolerance is a social contract. That means that both ends of the contract have to be upheld for it to be valid. Liz Wheeler pushes an ideology that is harmful to, and intolerant of trans and LGBT people as a whole.\n\nYou may think that the entire \"conversation\" surrounding trans people and their right to exist with dignity is a discussion of legitimate concerns instead of culture war bullshit designed to feed on the most vulnerable. In which case you have to ask yourself: Why are you disagreeing with the vast majority of trans people about issues that affect them and not you? Why do you think you know better than the very group in the crosshairs? Could it be that you're agreeing with information that feeds into the preexisting biases you already have?\n\nMore importantly, have you considered that it's really, REALLY weird for your views to be aligned with a group that outright refuses to condemn speech like \"For the good of society [...] transgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely\"?! BTW, in case you're wondering the person who said this is Michael Knowles from the Conservative Political Action Conference. It really doesn't sound like conservatives are upholding their end of the social contract, does it? Or are we expected to sit around and tolerate literal genocidal rhetoric? How has this worked out for other marginalized groups in the past?\n  \nThis is why institutions like JMU shouldn't allow people like Liz Wheeler to speak on their campuses; it not only creates a more hostile environment for transgender students, staff, and faculty, but it also shows an extreme lack of empathy and care for people who are actually affected by the hostile culture people like Liz help create and perpetuate.

But JMU, a state institution, cannot censor or suppress it.\n\n&gt;How has this worked out for other marginalized groups in the past?\n\nFreedom of speech and/or more speech has worked out far better for all marginalized groups than restricted and/or less speech.\n\n&gt;This is why institutions like JMU shouldn't allow people like Liz Wheeler to speak on their campuses\n\nThe First Amendment requires that they do so. Nothing else you said matters in the slightest. This is not a social contract, nor is it a moral standard.

Because people like her make claims that their struggle with their own identity and feeling horribly uncomfortable with themselves with nothing they can do about it (besides transition or express themselves in ways that DO make them feel comfortable in their own body), is an ideology. It is not an ideology, it is not something they chose to feel the same way they did not choose to be born male/female/intersex etc.\nWhat this woman is doing is spreading misinformation, plain and simple.",

The school distributes an activity fee to SGA. SGA must be absolutely viewpoint neutral and almost entirely content neutral in the way it distributes that fee. So if SGA would have approved this, say, to have Taylor Swift give an acoustic concert, they are legally required to approve the application of YAF to host this nutjob.\n\nThe Supreme Court case on this issue is University of Wisconsin v. Southworth. Wherein the Court says that public universities must be viewpoint neutral when distributing the funds of a student activity fee to, e.g., student groups like YAF.\n\nBut hey, now you learned something today, it's a good day.\n\n&gt;Where\u2019s my platform? Why am I being denied my free speech! \n\nDid a group on campus rent a forum and apply for SGA funds to do so? If so then you can speak in the exact same way she did and they can't say no.\n\n&gt;She can come on campus and scream all she wants about trans people but she is not entitled to a platform or our tuition money to do so\n\nThis is absolutely incorrect, for the reasons I've already explained to you.\n\n&gt;and I hope you would apply this rule to the other listed categories\u2026 \n\nWhat other listed categories? You mean all the other terrible and hateful speakers? Yes the same rules apply to them.\n\nIn fact, when a student group invited avowed white supremacist Richard Spencer to speak at Auburn, the university tried to cancel the event. The students sued, and won, in federal court, and Auburn was forced to host the event.\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2017/04/18/politics/auburn-richard-spencer-protests/index.html",

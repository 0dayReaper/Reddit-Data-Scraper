    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm a prospective Fall transfer looking to major in CS and will be a junior when I enter JMU. Applications aren't due until March 1st and I don't believe we hear back until late April, but I wanted to try and figure out details on housing as early as possible.\n\nWhat are typically the options? How early should one start looking? Is it it already late to look for housing? Any past transfers or prospective transfers with advice?\n\nThanks",

            "comment": "Typical options: You have quite a few options, I personally recommend Pheasant Run, but there are plenty of other housing options in the area. Your best bet is to google available housing near JMU (especially because of this next part)\n\nHow early to start looking: Most freshmen on campus choose their off campus housing for the next year around November, so it\u2019ll definitely be harder to find openings in some places. Search around and see what\u2019s open. Another option is to join one of the Facebook groups that shows students trying to sublet their lease for the next school year, and these pop up fairly frequently so just be on the lookout. And no it\u2019s not necessarily too late to look for housing, just going to be harder.",

There's also a bus shuttle so if you don't have access to a car, there's a bus that comes every day, multiple times a day. The community overall is pretty tight knit and it's a really cute area.",

I did / thought the following-\n\n* I talked to admissions folks at an open house and they said I shouldn't worry about not being accepted if my grades were good.\n*  If I'm not admitted, my plan is to live there anyway and do the online CS degree through Western Governor's rather than attend a different brick and mortar.\n* If something went further awry and I needed to get out of the lease, Pheasant Run seems coveted enough that I figured I'd have a decent shot of finding someone interested in taking it over.\n\nIt's a calculated bet and might not make sense for other people in different situations.",

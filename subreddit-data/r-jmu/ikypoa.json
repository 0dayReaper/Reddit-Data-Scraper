    "postText": "What has just happened to you all is beyond my imagination. JMU Administration failed you in every way possible. President Alger shouldn't have a job at JMU tomorrow, next semester, next year, let alone past that.\n\nBut you should not just contact the administration, they already know what they did, and will just do damage control to keep your story from spreading. They're the black hole of your anger and distrust right now. Nothing at all will come out of putting your concerns there.\n\nContacting the media is good to create a baseline set of facts and testimony, but it won't do much other than create a storm for JMU Communications to weather.\n\nSo, keeping in mind that as tuition and fee-paying students you're actually *kind of untouchable* just as long as you stay calm and keep to the facts of your experience:\n\n**(1) Contact the JMU Board of Visitors.**\n\nYou all need to contact the people that hired the President, approve the budget, and actually control EVERYTHING about JMU, from faculty tenure to dining services contracts to administrative appointments to approval of campus-wide initiatives to...everything:\n\n[https://www.jmu.edu/visitors/about/Contact.shtml](https://www.jmu.edu/visitors/about/Contact.shtml)\n\nThe Board of Visitors is who you all need to contact. I wish I'd known that when I went there. Would have saved a lot of time.\n\n**(2) File a FOIA Request**\n\nAlso, especially if you work for The Breeze (or are a student who might have some free time and above-average curiosity) and haven't already, think about keywords used by the administration in reference to the coronavirus planning and response, and then consult this site:\n\n[https://www.jmu.edu/visitors/about/foia.shtml](https://www.jmu.edu/visitors/about/foia.shtml)\n\n...and then develop and send the relevant VA FOIA request (see \"How to: Submit a FOIA Request\" [here](https://www.va.gov/FOIA/Requests.asp)) to [foia@jmu.edu](mailto:foia@jmu.edu).\n\nThey may attempt to make you pay for your university's records about their plans for you, or try to charge you ahead of time to stop your request. Don't pay a dime. If you're a student journalist and using it for those purposes, just say so and argue for an exemption to the cost.  If you're not a student journalist, this can still apply to you (see the above \"How to: Submit a FOIA Request\" site for more information):\n\n&gt;Fee Waivers Agencies may grant fee waivers if the requester successfully describes that the disclosure of information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\n\nThat's you! Press your rights and get a fee waiver.\n\n**(3) Contact the Faculty Senate:**\n\n[https://www.jmu.edu/facultysenate/](https://www.jmu.edu/facultysenate/)\n\nAnd ask them (specifically Faculty Senate Speaker [larsenwv@jmu.edu](mailto:larsenwv@jmu.edu)...sorry Val, it's most certainly not your fault this happened!), or create a student petition to ask them, to call for a full and secret-ballot faculty vote of (no) confidence in President Alger. That will also get the BOV's attention, even just as a potentiality.",

But even that exemption is largely unnecessary, because:\n\nA LOT of the records you'll be seeking are not paper records. They are just emails or Outlook meeting subjects/notes among administration, or digital server files that might contain your listed keywords.\n\nAt JMU the shared file drive is the [N:Drive](https://www.jmu.edu/computing/communication-and-collaboration/network-file-storage.shtml). So, journalist or not, make sure you ask for relevant documents from the email server (I believe this is exchange.jmu.edu, but perhaps consult IT for what to call it, I bet they'd help) and the N:Drive in your request for searches.\n\nYou should not accept charges for access to those documents as they would result in no photocopies.\n\nIf for some reason they attempt to charge you for physical documents, amend and resubmit your request for ONLY digital documents on the mail server and the N:Drive.",

It's a mid-to-large sized university\n\nOther colleges and universities in Virginia have not done nearly as poorly.\n\nCompared to other public universities in Virginia, JMU has stagnated a bit. For example, VCU and CNU used to be placed people transferred to JMU from. Now they're basically peer institutions. VCU has passed JMU for some majors. JMU is still a very good institution. I am happy to hear about the scholarship aspect, if true.\n\nThe JMU administration has negatively impacted all their students' lives, and given JMU a black eye that will last for years. So even if you think they've done a great job up until now, they had by far the worst \"plan\" in the Commonwealth and they squandered all the gains you think they deserve credit for.",

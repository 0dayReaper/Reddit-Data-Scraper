I'm fairly confident, I'm just not exactly sure what to expect from SMAD101?? What is the course material? I haven't nailed down a concentration yet either but I assume that's what 101 is for, I have 2 I'm eyeballing",

If you can typically manage history classes, it won't be too tough. You'll have to apply based on your success in that class, your total GPA, and an essay (I think), so make it count if you're worried about not getting through. \n\nI did ok in the class and fine overall and I got in. You just don't want to lag behind your peers if your GPA is possibly starting from a lower point.",

Just pay attention in class and do the videos. There is assigned readings but personally I just took good notes in class and on the videos. I finished with a 93.",

The material is really nothing too overwhelming, but you just want to avoid failing any of the tests early on or else you\u2019ll be making it kind of hard on yourself. Just take good notes and pay attention and you\u2019re already most of the way there.",

If you have any questions or need to attend office hours, he's there for you. Content wise, not difficult at all, it follows the textbook exactly which is about a general overview on media. You'll get a hang of the class easy so don't stress it.   \n\n\nHuge tip though, pay attention to the textbook. Oh, random detail you think you don't need to know? No. That will pop up in your tests. The tests are a huge part of your grade and average on them are usually a low B. Your notes should be about 6 pages long and you should read the entire text. Don't skim and don't just read the first pages of paragraphs.   \n\n\nGood luck! If you need any help, DM me and I can send you my notes or give you tips on what will probably appear on tests.",

You need to read every chapter, whatch every video and take good notes. It makes a big diffrence to get a study group and get to know both smalls and alessi. Alessi was my fav teacher i ever had he loves smad 101 and geniuenly wants to get to know every one of his students",

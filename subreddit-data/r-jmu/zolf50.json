Both could be fun. \n\nBennys, Vito\u2019s, and Rudy\u2019s are good pizza places. Rudy\u2019s arcade has games. There\u2019s book stores and game stores in downtown harrisonburg as well.\n\nRoanoke is a 3 hour drive but they have museums and stuff to do too. \n\nWhy are you stuck in H-burg? Winter classes?",

It\u2019s definitely harder to get involved in school with organizations and such but I personally like the freedom to be able to do school work from home and school. It\u2019s definitely a different experience from your typical college student but you just try it.",

I personally just didn\u2019t venture out and put in the best effort to do so but I know many commuters in so many organizations. I\u2019m not the social person so that has to due with why.",

I did have to fight my way through to get a parking space early on and quickly learned which parking decks go first and the best places to park on campus. \n\nIt was a bit harder to get a social life at first but after some time I did find friends in a couple of clubs (and I'm on the exec board for a few)",

                    "comment": "Very similar. PPC is a two passenger trike that requires a sport pilots license and FAA registration to fly legally, among other things. Paramotors are single seat ultralight aircraft that fall under FAR part 103. Can\u2019t be over 254 lbs dry weight, no more than 5 gallons of fuel, recreational use only, power off stall speed may not exceed 24 knots of airspeed. PPC flies a little faster, more stable, and not a very good glide ratio. Paramotor is the opposite, relatively slow (unless you have a speed bar) long glide slope, geared more towards acro flying. The guy you are referencing is named Tucker Gott. He is well recognized as one of the most famous paramotor pilots in the nation. Also the 4th man on the planet to perform a power loop. Wing-over into a full power back flip all while under canopy. Open cockpit is one of the truest forms of flight. I put in earbuds, goggles, and just go. Weather is the greatest factor for something as light as what we fly but you can get into either side of the sport for under 10 grand. One of the most enjoyable things you can do with your clothes on",

And then followed up to see training courses down in Florida are about 6k haha.\n\nBut that's sweet man thanks for the response.  When you takeoff in yours do you also need a solid 100 meters of empty space to takeoff and land or since yours is a bit faster do you not need as much space?",

Sorry but i got sport pilot training for a quarter of that and you don\u2019t need a license for paramotors yet they charge 6k\ud83d\ude44 \nThere are guys that picked up a paramotor and a good wing for about 4 grand and self taught. My brother did that and other than 2 close calls due to sheer self inflicted stupidity he\u2019s been fine ever since. \nAll the Russian cats that fly in this area are self taught and fly in weather they have no business flying in and haven\u2019t died yet. It\u2019s the best training money can buy but 6k is fiscal assault and battery. \n\nI can do 100m in perfect conditions but that\u2019s asking for it. I fly from a small private strip west of Harrisonburg that is 1800\u2019 long. Local farmer has a hangar and a few guys fly different planes out of there.",

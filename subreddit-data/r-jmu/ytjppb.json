    "postText": "I am a Sophomore Computer Science major at JMU and I was wondering if anyone had any strong opinions regarding any professors teaching MATH220 - Elementary Statistics. I've never taken a stats course before and I'm slightly worried as I have had a difficult time with MATH 231-231 (Taken with Professor Woodruff and Professor O'Shea respectively). I am currently enrolled with Professor Brant Jones, but his RateMyProfessor scores leave some pretty significant doubt. As of now, I might email Professor Colleen Watson to see if her full class may fit one more, as she has incredible ratings on RateMyProfessor. Any insight or help into this process would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

So much of what we\u2019re required to learn is useless outside of class (imho), so might as well condense the bullshit into a few weeks rather than a whole semester yknow",

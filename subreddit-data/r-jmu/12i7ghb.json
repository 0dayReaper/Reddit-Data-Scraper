For reference next semester, they have 14 sections of 149 open, 11 or so sections of of 159, and 1-3 sections of all the other CORE cs classes. It has a drastically high failure rate. \n\nI\u2019ve heard nursing and Accounting are difficult as well",

Systems elective is also rough. \n\nA bunch of the cs electives can also be brutal. I believe 354 (robotics) in particular is difficult.\n\nTLDR: Kind of an endless onslaught of classes. While a bunch of them aren\u2019t bad on their own, once you get like 3 programming assignments due one day and module quizzes at the end of the week, it can be brutal",

            "comment": "I'm not sure how it is now, but music education was a lot harder than CS when I was a student. It was 150 credits. That included required ensemble rehearsals that were 1 credit for 3 hours per week or 2 credits for 5 hours per week. And there were some 0-credit required classes. You had to audition for and get accepted into the School of Music with your primary instrument. You had to take lessons on and become reasonably proficient  on a second instrument, which music performance majors didn't have to do. You had to do most of the music performance major with most of the (not music) education major. And you had to be in the Marching Royal Dukes for two seasons. And you usually had to take a practicum which involved a semester of student teaching. I know music education majors who were doing 27 credits of classes in a semester to finish on time.\n\nInstead of dealing with that, I switched to CS. I aced 139 and 239, which were 4 credits and have been replaced by 139/149 and 159. I graduated with a 3.7 major GPA and only 126 credits.\n\nI know 139, 149, and 159 have a high drop rate, but I'm not sure how many of the students in those classes were planning to be CS majors and minors. I was a TA for 239 (which became 159) and I remember a lot of the students were taking 239 as an elective or as an alternative to the CIS and ISAT programming classes\n\nThey also completely redesigned the CS curriculum a couple of years before I graduated so maybe it's a lot harder now.",

I came in with a lot of transfer credit so I've actually been able to take some classes outside of music. All of the other departments I've interacted with point to music majors whenever their students complain about workload.\n\nMost of us take at least 18 credits a semester (many overload and do 22). Ensembles are all 1 credit and there are 0 credit classes, so we're in around 12 classes per semester. Those 1 credit classes still meet 3-4 times a week though. There have been semesters where I am in back-to-back classes from 8am to 7pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and we also have a lot of classes on Fridays for some reason.",

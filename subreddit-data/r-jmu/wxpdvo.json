When should I sign the lease? Or should I wait and join a lease with other girls I find?\n\nAlso any other info about Sunchase that I should know would be great!!",

The bus there is awesome, and I rode it for a full school year prior to my practicum and student teaching. It\u2019s super convenient and comes every 15 minutes. After 6? Pm, the schedule changes, so be on the lookout. There is a bus app! Sunchase fills up pretty quickly, so I\u2019d start looking for roommates now. Call and ask when they are asking for renewals to re-sign by (usually Mid-October), and new potential residents should be able to sign leases the day after! \n\nI absolutely loved my experience there. I\u2019d undoubtedly choose them again. :)",

It\u2019s just tough to get groceries, but if you have friends with cars you can just go with them. For rooms you usually get to pick your room with your roommates, or if you go random you may just get assigned one. In regards to signing, I\u2019d say the sooner the better that way you get a bit more say in which building you\u2019d like to live in.",

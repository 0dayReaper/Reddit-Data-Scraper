This was 2005-2009.\n\nI got into tech before JMU. Tech quickly accepted me. I would\u2019ve gone there had JMU rejected me. When I got the JMU acceptance letter and a wait list at UVA, I didn\u2019t hesitate to pick JMU and send a \u201cno thanks\u201d to the others. I enjoyed every minute and don\u2019t regret the decision. I\u2019m now a fiercely loyal alum who still follows the sports regularly and goes back a handful of times a year to Harrisonburg. I love that town.",

I ended up paying my deposit at JMU and then as a last ditch effort I wrote a letter to the admissions department at VT pouring my heart out about why I wanted to go there. I then attended Choices at JMU, found a roommate, and fell in love with JMU. Then, a few weeks later, I got off the tech wait list. I was SO excited and decided to head down to Blacksburg one last time to check out the communications department. I had a really bad experience and overall didn\u2019t love VT as much as I loved JMU. Went to JMU and it was the best decision I\u2019ve ever made. I had the time of my life and made forever friends. My advice: tour both schools one last time and factor your major into your decision. If you want to study liberal arts, JMU might be a better choice. If your major is more STEM oriented, VT might be the better choice. Hope that helps!",

There\u2019s definitely bad eggs but once you find some people to hang with and in your major it\u2019s awesome. I spent covid pretty lonely and I didn\u2019t make my friend group until Junior year. It was also close to home for me which was a plus. You should go here because it\u2019s affordable and actually prepared you for a job. I majored in CS and am working alongside people who have masters degrees and went to MIT. It really is a god school for getting a job due to its broad network.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am an incoming freshmen and I am interested in doing something in the field of environmental science/studies. Right now, I am in between a major in integrated science and technology with a concentration in environmental science and sustainability, or a major in geology with an environmental concentration. I was wondering if there was any insight on course load or job prospects from either of the two majors. \nThanks!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m biased, but I strongly recommend the Geography program! There\u2019s an Environmental Conservation, Sustainability, and Development concentration, and you can also create your own custom one. Most people add at least one Environmental minor as well (there are 5). Environmental Science and Environmental Management in particular may be of interest to you\n\nEdit: there\u2019s also a new Climate Science minor",

So I\u2019m assuming the geography program has a lot to do with like satellites and digital mapping? I don\u2019t have much background knowledge but that\u2019s another one to consider. Thanks!",

You can also design your own concentration (or dual concentrate)! JMU\u2019s program has been nationally recognized and I\u2019ve personally had a great experience with it - the profs are amazing and very kind, there are research opportunities, and people are super supportive and welcoming in general. \n\nSince JMU doesn\u2019t have a direct Environmental Science major, the environmental minors are quite popular - I\u2019d recommend looking into them, as it seems like they would fit nicely with whichever major you choose :)\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, between ISAT and Geology I would probably choose ISAT. It\u2019s versatile and seems more applicable to many areas of interest. Geology often leads to the oil industry, and although there\u2019s a similar moral dilemma with Geography majors and defense contracting jobs, Geology feels more restrictive. The primary issue I see with ISAT is explaining it to employers as it\u2019s a unique major, but from what I\u2019ve seen and heard the program does a good job preparing you for that aspect as well",

I have seen a lot with geology going into oil/petroleum and that definitely isn\u2019t something I\u2019d be interested in. One of my main turnaways from isat is, like you mentioned, having to explain isat every time, or an employer going with a more \u201ctried and true\u201d major. I feel like I\u2019ve already explained isat 1000 times and I haven\u2019t even started! \n\nLuckily I have a little bit of time to decide, but I really appreciate you taking the time to answer!",

The isat major was actually what drew me to jmu, I thought it was very interesting and unique idea. My only concern is if future employers don\u2019t understand the major or feel like the knowledge is more \u201csurface level\u201d compared to other majors. I think the general knowledge of isat is cool but I\u2019m also afraid it will turn me away as a job applicant, compared to somebody who has a bachelors in a more specific field like geology.",

JMU has one of the best undergrad geology departments in the state and from my experience, not a single bad professor. We also have a strong tightly knit community and a lounge specifically for geology students to hang out between classes (or overnight if you\u2019re anything like me).\n\nFor an environmental career, I highly recommend a geology degree. A geologist can do anything an environmental scientist can do but they also qualify to work towards the PG license which gives you a big boost in pay and is a huge resume booster.\n\nPlease if you have any questions about the geology department feel free to ask! You can also get in touch with our department head, Dr. Leslie\u2019s office. He\u2019s the type who will immediately set everything aside and give you a tour of the department. If the semester were still going I\u2019d recommend just walking back there and heading into the lounge called \u201cRock City\u201d and asking some of the students in there.",

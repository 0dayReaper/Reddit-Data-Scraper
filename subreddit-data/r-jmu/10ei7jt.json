To be admitted through Early Action, a student needs to be superior in curriculum and grades. For the last two years, 35 to 42 percent of the students deferred from Early Action to Regular Decision were eventually admitted.\n\nA deferred decision means that the Admissions Committee is not yet ready to make a final decision on your Early Action application. The Admissions Committee recognizes your academic potential and believes your application deserves further consideration for admission.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sure t feels like a blow to her, but I think there's cause to be hopeful.",

From what I understand, a lot more students are deferred because so many students do early action now that jmu started using common app. It\u2019s not necessarily about ur daughters potential. Even getting waitlisted, the wait list is huge as well because they started using it. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much!",

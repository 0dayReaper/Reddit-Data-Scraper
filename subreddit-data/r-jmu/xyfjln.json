Now I don't think they let it drop out enough on the time it was the worst and black mold will probably grow there.  \n\nNoise isolation is pretty bad honestly, upstairs is pretty easy to hear people walking as well as neighbors being generally loud.\n\nApartment wasn't overly clean when I moved in.  They charge residents who move out for not cleaning, but don't clean it themselves.\n\nI moved to Pheasant Run this year and like it much better.  I was paying $427 at the Harrison and I'm currently paying $435 at Pheasant.  It's a little bit bigger, and feels significantly bigger as it's 2 floors.  Noise isolation is much better and i haven't heard my neighbors once.  It was also cleaner on move in and maintenance also seems decent so far.\n\nMy dislike for the Harrison was mostly due to lots of little things that could be over looked and having two crappy roommates at the times pretty make me more bias against it.",

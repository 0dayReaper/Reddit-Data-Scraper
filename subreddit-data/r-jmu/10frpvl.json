    "postText": "So I just graduated in Dec and unfortunately do not have health insurance so I\u2019ve been using the health center while I was a student for all my medical needs. My JACard still works for some reason in some places and I can still use the on campus wifi/my email etc. i was wondering if I can set up an appointment with the health center and be treated? Does anyone know for sure? i have successfully made an appointment and it scheduled but idk if they will actually see me once I arrive",

The first thing you'll lose when they update the system will be Wifi access probably. The systems prob haven't been updated yet due to the break.\n\nI don't believe they'll see you and might just send you to an urgent care or charge you after the fact once things have been updated etc. Though at this point since you made the appointment just call and ask them directly and explain your situation. Worst thing they can do is say no. Pretending to still be a student seems like something they will easily be able to find out.",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m a senior cs student here at jmu. I just accepted a really nice full time offer as a software engineer after I graduate. Unfortunately, because I transferred here after my freshmen year, I\u2019m a little behind and I need to take 4 cs classes, all electives. I was wondering which cs electives would be easiest to manage? I need a systems elective, algorithms elective, and two of the 300 level electives besides databases. Im currently taking 361 327 and 430 and have a B in all of them so I think I can handle 4 cs electives. Im just wondering which ones are easiest. For systems I was thinking about taking advanced computer networking as my full time position is in back end web development. What are y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts",

            "comment": "for you systems elective compilers is definitely the easiest and it's really I interesting! for your algorithms elective your only options are 412 and 452 I believe, I've heard 452 is much harder. As for other 300 level electives, I know dr.kirkpatrick has an ethical issues in computing course that would count (im not sure when he offers it tho). Also the webdev course is divided into 2 classes now and I'd highly recommend both :) I'm a cs senior graduation in December so pm me if you have anymore questions!",

I really enjoyed the class because I chose not to do the big project that was worth 10-15% of the grade (cause I was just pass fail). But all the CS majors were freaking out about it. If you are confident in yourself take the class for sure.\n\nAlso don't take them as pass fail if you need it for your major! Mine was just a straight elective credit which is why I could",

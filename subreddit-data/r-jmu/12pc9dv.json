    "postText": "Harrisonburg Parks and Recreation Advisory Board will be meeting on Monday, April 17th at 7PM at Lucy Simms, and we are asking for Skateboarders, BMX riders, their supporters and anyone else that will use a new skatepark to show up to support the need of our community being heard.\n\nThe skatepark we have used for a quarter of a century was abruptly bulldozed recently, and plans for a metal skate park were suddenly announced to a massive outcry of discontent. We want Parks and Rec to know that moving forward with a plan that is known to be incredibly flawed and doomed, is a bad idea, CONTRACT OR NOT. A metal skate park will be worse than the one that was just destroyed.\n\nWe know a concrete park is safer, more fun, the industry standard, more aesthetic, much quieter and more long lasting. There are no valid reasons to build a metal skatepark. A concrete park is affordable within the City's current budget for the NEW PARK. There are simply no problems with constructing a new skate park out of concrete with the current budget that can't be solved. \n\nAlso, please sign this petition to show your support and read more of the situation as it is now and how we got to where we are by our voices being ignored or unengaged in this process. Now is the time to be heard and thankfully IT IS NOT TOO LATE!\n\nSIGN THE PETITION:\nhttps://chng.it/VR4LDR5rCq\n\nFacebook Event:\n\nhttps://facebook.com/events/s/help-skateboarders-get-the-fac/2293776287458784/",

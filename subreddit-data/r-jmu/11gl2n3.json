    "postText": "I honestly enjoyed taking 291 last semester and I\u2019m considering applying for the minor. I\u2019m going to major in accounting (start cob 300 this fall) and I\u2019m worried about the workload of the minor classes with the classes for my major. I\u2019ve read everything on the Jmu website about this minor but I really want a good overview of things from students before I apply/ don\u2019t apply. \n\nFor people currently taking it or completed the minor, how is it? What\u2019s the best or what\u2019s your favorite part about it? Is the workload and difficulty of the classes easy or hard to balance with your major/ other classes? Is there anything you wish you knew about the classes or minor before you started it?",

            "comment": "I graduated with the BSAN minor and absolutely loved it, definitely my favorite part of my academic experience at JMU.\n\nBest part for me was easily the professors. They're all fantastic (assuming they haven't changed who's teaching the classes since I graduated). The BSAN courses are clearly their break from teaching 191/291, when they actually get to cover content they care about and teach students who actually want to be in their class, so they're all really passionate about the course.\n\nThat said, the BSAN classes were probably the most challenging courses I took at JMU in terms of conceptual difficulty, especially the statistics-focused course (BSAN 390, I think?). That one caused more than a few people in my cohort to drop the minor at the withdrawal deadline. However, all the professors really want you to succeed and will absolutely help you if you're struggling.\n\nAs for course workload, i.e., amount of work we had to do, I don't remember thinking any of the courses were particularly bad. Though there were a couple significant projects per course, we were given plenty of time to do them and the professors were generally good about scheduling around key deadlines for other courses. However, when we did have an assignment to complete, it usually took a while just due to the complexity of the subject matter and the depth of analysis/interpretation required, so waiting until the last second was not an option.\n\nOverall, incrediblely glad I took the minor. I didn't go into an analytics-related job after college, but I still use the skills I learned all the time, probably more so than my major courses. And it's really helpful to be able to \"speak\" analytics when necessary.",

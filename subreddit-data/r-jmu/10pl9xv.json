    "postText": "Hi there! I'm going to be a freshman at JMU next year and have been looking into the dorm rooms. I've been looking at the Shenandoah Hall double room with a bathroom, which from the online tour looks like it's just a bathroom with only two people using it. Not sure if it is actually like that though, cuz I can't find any dorm tours or anything like that where they have actually shown a room like that.",

            "comment": "As the other commenter said, Shenandoah has communal hall-style bathrooms (I lived there freshman year if you have other questions) - there's a few stalls and sinks like a typical public bathroom, and then a section with several showers. There are two bathrooms along the hallway.\n\nEdit: there are also a couple private one-person bathrooms on the first floor. And a big hint, try and get one of the rooms at the very end overlooking E-hall on the upper floors (ex. 432), they are a fair bit larger with more windows.",

They do put non-disabled students in the rooms when not all of them are taken, but I would in no way count on getting one. I have no idea if any of the bathroom equipment actually works when a non-disabled student is occupying the room but that's probably the room you saw! I have no memory of which room numbers they are though and the odds of getting one seem really slim. Hope you have luck!",

            "comment": "Altitude LOOKS nice during a tour, because they furnish all their units and are still reasonably new. But you\u2019ll notice the problems quickly and understand why their tenants leave ASAP:\n\nThe walls at Altitude are TOO thin. Constant stomping from above, can hear next-door neighbors\u2019 conversations crisply. There is no such thing as a private conversation here, because the doors block NO sound. Hung a sign on the front door and could occasionally hear people talking about it in the hallway. I could reply to them and be understood, from the opposite side of my unit. \n\nThe windows don\u2019t open. You breathe the same stale, stinky air as everyone else. Oh yeah, lot of weed smokers live here too, you\u2019ll be able to smell them when you walk in the building\n\nThe hallways are too long and narrow. Feels like a horror movie every time you walk down them alone. But God forbid there\u2019s someone at the opposite end walking your way, it\u2019s so fucking awkward every time. \n\nI needed maintenance constantly. I was the first to live in my unit, and they told me the building was so rushed that they cut a lot of corners with piping and the kitchen especially. My washer/dryer (brand new to the unit) were also broken, so that was an adventure in itself. Sometimes you wake up, or get home, and the power is completely out, with no explanation. Also hated the constant fire alarms. \n\nParking is CUTTHROAT. Feels like parking on campus. Population density at Altitude is probably higher than any other complex in Hburg, so if you get home after dinnertime, good chance you\u2019ll have to park in the gravel lot. Walking a quarter mile from your parking space to your front door is never fun. They even started charging a monthly fee to park next to the building, they\u2019re not even hiding that they just want your money\n\nPros: is furnished, utilities/internet included in rent\n\nCons: everything else\n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid. I lived there during quarantine because I couldn\u2019t find any alternatives. I should have looked harder.",

The rent was reasonable, the location was pretty close to campus and we rarely had any problems. When we did maintenance was great and super responsive. It was a great place to live and I have no regrets!!",

            "comment": "i live in altitude currently and agree with the other poster about it. it looks great in pictures and on tour but they are total scam artists - they raised my rent and charged me a 30$ fee with no explanation then were ridiculous rude when i called and asked. ultimately it was because they signed me into their insurance without my consent, changed the terms of my lease (pretty sure that\u2019s illegal but idek) and then refused to refund me. \nparking is also terrible and people drive through the lot like it\u2019s a race track. the rooftop also gets rented out so be prepared to have 50+ drunk strangers wandering around your complex on any given weekend &amp; since the walls are so thin you will hear it all.\nthere is also a huge bug problem and black mold. someone i knew last year from here had literal mushrooms growing in their closet and when it snowed outside there was about 3 inches of snow accumulating inside of my room because they didn\u2019t seal off the vent. \nspeaking of vents, the AC systems aren\u2019t even new - they took them from a complex that was being torn down.\nalso if you do end up living here be prepared to constantly hear your neighbors and smell weed 24/7 (that may be a pro if you enjoy the smell of weed though lol) \nthe only pro i can think of is the maintenance staff is really nice but the office staff has maybe one nice member while the rest seem bothered to have to do their jobs.\nall in all, do not reccomend living here, i wish i hadn\u2019t resigned because it is a huge waste of money.",

Then last summer they started giving tenants parking passes, and they made me sign a paper for my pass \u201cso I wouldn\u2019t get towed.\u201d They failed to explain that the paper was a lease renewal. (Is this how they got you too?) I pleaded to the manager, I hated living there and had no intention of resigning. Nope, once my name was on there I was obligated to pay them 12 more months of rent summer 21-22. It was kind of cathartic though, walking down the hallways this summer and seeing the green \u201cI\u2019m moving out\u201d sheets on EVERY SINGLE DOOR in my hallway. Just a matter of time before everybody understands signing there at all is a big mistake.",

Parking is a bit messy, but you will find a spot if you\u2019re a resident. Visitor parking is a mess though, and towing is cutthroat here.",

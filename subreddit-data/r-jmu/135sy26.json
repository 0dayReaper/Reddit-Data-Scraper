    "postText": "howdy y'all, I'm returning to JMU this fall and am currently apartment hunting. Internet speed/reliability are relatively important due to what I am coming back for, and I was curious if anyone had experience with the Cottages on port republic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know they have internet through a company called Pavlov Media that handles the actual connection, and it's apparently *fiber*, but I cannot find anything about what speeds are available to the units, or if i can bring my own equipment. Tried calling but the people on staff at that time were not sure either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks much!",

POSCI was really easy when I did it at online at my CC. \n\nTransferology is a great site that can help you figure out what to take if you\u2019re interested in doing others too. Generally, though, almost everything transfers.",

I took POSCI 225 with LaPira, there were some reading assignments. One of the assignments was to watch house of cards and write about it. It wasn't that hard. I don't know anything about JUST 225",

I wanted to know from Accounting majors do you recommend JMU\u2019s Accounting program, how are the professors, what are the exams and homework like, and do they have great Accounting internships. Thank you",

I believe we had the highest cpa pass rate in Virginia, as well. Every big four and large regional firm recruits heavily from JMU.",

            "comment": "JMU Actg alum here. Both masters and undergrad. Accounting program is great and will set you up extremely well to go into public accounting and pass the CPA exams with ease. Professors are amazing and so is the actg support staff. Extremely easy to secure internships every summer and I don\u2019t know any of my classmates who didn\u2019t have a full time job lined up. Big 4 and the rest of the top 20 actg firms recruit heavy at JMU so that should be no worry. \n\nThat being said, really think twice about going into the accounting industry. 99% of people who go into public actg are overworked and underpaid. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see in the next couple of years if the industry will catch up with other fields such as ones you could enter with a CIS/finance/QFIN degree. Seeing a lot of my COB finance/cis/qfin peers finish school in 4 years and land jobs paying significantly higher than big4 aduit/tax had me feeling some FOMO. \n\npm me if you want to talk more!",

Across the board, the CIS/finance/and QFIN grads were paid significantly more out the gate than their accounting counterparts. Just something to keep in mind. But if your heart is in accounting rather than those other fields, don\u2019t let the lower pay deter you.",

I took Financial and Managerial accounting and even though I got good grades in them I wasn\u2019t interested in Accounting. Plus I don\u2019t even want to be a CPA. A lot of people have told me Finance does pay more than accounting you can get a offer starting off with 70-85k with Finance. Accountants gets 50-65k starting off and they work way make hours with less pay.",

Busy season for accountants is definitely crazy, but for finance if you\u2019re going into consulting, you\u2019re easily signing yourself up for 50+ hour weeks, depending on your client. I wouldn\u2019t expect to come into either with a straight 9-5 job mindset, but I didn\u2019t think it was onerous or bad work going into financial consulting. Did it for about 3 years before transitioning into law.",

I remember when I was considering Intermediate 2, the choices were Irving - whose exams were like 3 hours long and had tons of homework - and Gabbin - whose homework was pretty much optional grade-wise and his exams were like 40 minutes but absolutely brutal. Ultimately, there isn't a bad professor around, or even anything close\n\nIf you're going into Accounting, I'd highly recommend it - big firms scout a lot at JMU, basically everyone I know went to KPMG (I didn't, but even so, got an offer from Thornton before choosing a different direction in the field than commercial public). I'd also recommend the MSA - the teaching is even better and it's basically a huge CPA review course, which is great for obvious reasons. Without Duxbury/Betancourt/Copley, REG and FAR would be such lost causes right now",

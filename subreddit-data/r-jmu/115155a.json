    "postText": "Thoughts on The Retreat (Redpoint) vs. The Cottages from anyone that lives there or knows someone that does? \n\nI\u2019m thinking about moving into the retreat because it seems more student focused, where the Cottages is nice cuz it\u2019s more like an actual house. These are my thoughts on each but what are your thoughts/experiences on both of these and which is better?\n\nThe Retreat: Cottages have three floors so seems like it would be quiet on weekends, the flooring feels better than the concrete at the cottages, rooms are a good size and most utilities are included, don\u2019t have to pay extra for furniture. The bus seems to come often\n\nThe Cottages: cottages are basically a house - you wouldn\u2019t guess it\u2019s a student apartment. The walls seem thick and everything seems high quality. Large kitchen but have to pay for all utilities and furniture not included. The bus at the cottages seems to come less frequently than the retreat\n\n\nI\u2019m looking for an apartment/cottages that have bigger rooms and is quieter especially on weekends when I may not want to go to a party/an overall upgrade from where I am at Southview right now",

The month of December itself was 163 and none of us were even there and made sure everything was turned off/plugs taken out just in case. \n\nWe also had a leak problem and our heater also broke. With how much we\u2019re paying, it\u2019s ridiculous that these kinds of problems even come up and numerous houses have had heating problems. The walls are also actually surprisingly thin. If your roommate is either in their closet or bathroom, you can have a perfect coherent conversation with them. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.",

It\u2019s also a double/full bed, and I think the retreat has a queen size. But tons of guest parking which is nice and the gate is something to consider if you want that or not.",

Do you know how much utilities would cost like on average? \n\nWhen I toured they told me $60 average but I\u2019ve heard some people say especially in the winter their bills are a lot higher. As for the gate, it doesn\u2019t really matter to me but one thing I did notice is the bedrooms are bigger in the cottages but I do like that the retreat has a thermostat on each floor which is awesome.\n\nThe only thing with the cottages that seems weird is being in practically a house instead of like an apartment or cottage but I guess you\u2019d get used to it",

Concrete flooring sucks though and it gets really cold on first floor. This will in turn effect ur utility bill, expect it to be about 100/m in the winter months. Overall, cottages is great would recommend if your willing to drop a bag, was worth it for my last semester. For less of a bag, I'd check out copper beach.",

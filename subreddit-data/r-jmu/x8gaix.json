It\u2019s also a bit of a drive from Harrisonburg (I\u2019m semi local) and I 10/10 recommend New Market Veterinary Clinic in New Market (it\u2019s about 20 minutes north on 81). Be aware that they only operate on walk in hours as their appointments but they\u2019re one of the best clinics as well as affordable.",

    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all,\nI just got accepted into JMU and was wondering what the housing situation is like. I\u2019ll be a junior, I know at my current university we have dorms that only freshman are allowed in and vice versa (only upperclassman). Is it like that at JMU? What\u2019s the likelihood of getting into Grace St. Apartments? If I had to get off-campus housing, how difficult is that in the city of Harrisonburg and would I have to commute far? \nThanks so much!",

            "comment": "Transfer student as well, never lived on campus tho. If you live off campus the drive to campus isn\u2019t bad. I can get on campus 10 mins or less. If you live at north 38 or altitude apartments you\u2019d be far from campus compared to a lot of other apartments. From what I know about on campus dorms is that some don\u2019t have ac and  all dorms have you sharing a room. Off campus housing you\u2019d get your own room and maybe your own bathroom.\n\nAlso finding a parking spot on campus can be hard but it\u2019s manageable if you pick a spot that\u2019s not super close to whatever building you need to go into. Cheapest lease I was able to get was 424$ a month with utilities included. \n\nGood luck fam",

I also got an acceptance letter in the mail. But my home address is in Maryland, so I think my chances were a lil better just because I\u2019m not eligible for in-state tuition (and colleges want the most money they can get lol). My GPA is a 3.83 and I never took the SAT or ACT. I\u2019m really involved at my current campus though. But from what I\u2019ve read/heard, most people get in. Best of luck with everything and try to stay positive!",

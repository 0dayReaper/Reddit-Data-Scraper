    "postText": "I'm transferring to JMU as a junior in the fall. Currently have an associates in business from community college but will be switching to majoring in CS.  Since I don't need any other gen ed credits my prof suggested I look for a minor to fill some spots. Haven't given much thought to a minor in general so I'm looking for any suggestions on what pairs well with major in CS and AB?  I'm hoping to find something where the requirements may overlap.  Is there a site other than the general majors and minors page that might have more info?",

            "comment": "I didn't think of this earlier. What are you career goals? Tech? Getting into Finance? One of the big consultant firms? That'll tell you what to add to CS. If it's Tech, I would say do a liberal arts degree to get better understand the human condition and how we relate to each other. Philosophy is strongly connected to CS. \n\nIf Finance or consulting is the goal, Data Analytics, Automation (which I assume you are getting now in CS, I'm an old head), or Security are all solids additions. I'll warn you, though. The best automation expert I work with was an Accounting major - no CS experience at all. In these fields, you need to be great at PowerPoint and presentations generally - tailoring to the audience. I work with a lot of folks from the big consulting firms. The ones that move up are the hardest workers. They are the most diligent and generally socially intellegant. \n\nIf a Defense contractor, General Dynamics, etc, is the goal, that's outside my experience. Anything related to war seems to be a solid career, unfortunately. Drones look to be the future of warfare. The F35 has an incredible amount of tech - just look at the pilot's helmet. \n\nDon't work for Guidehouse - they will work you to death and never give you the resources to succeed. KPMG can be good, but I've been oversold and overpromised by them. Others have had a better experience. EY seems to be the best. Our old CFO came from there. You get a lot of client-facing exposure no matter what level you are. You are able to tailor your career to your interests. They also seem to be better at work-life balance. In any of these firms, you have a shot at getting in unlike, say Boston Consulting Group, where you have no chance without an Ivy or Ivy-analog degree.",

Even if you do get into a good firm, you need to have an exit plan. A lot of successful folks treat it like the armed services. Do your 20 years and save up to be independent after that. This means sacrificing your 20's and 30's, unfortunately. I'm talking 60 hour workweeks for years on end.\n\nI'm not sure about tech. It seems to be maturing which means less opportunity. I'd encourage anyone unsure about their career path to do consulting. You get to see lots of different types of business and government. One of them you never would have considered might be the one that you are the best fit for.",

It's been established long ago that he isn't actually Christian, just a scammer looking for someone to take a swing at him.\n\nI'm not even religious, I just feel bad for those who are religious and have to deal with this. Also, it's just mad annoying",

People like him exist all around the country and they are going to keep doing everything in their power to strip the LGBTQ community of our rights. Some are just more powerful than others. The entire reason why protests exist is to show that we aren't going to stay quiet while people do this. Because the truth is that us shutting up and ignoring the bigotry IS what they want. They want us to let them get away with it so they can take it to the government, and god knows they've tried. You can do what you want but being a quiet minority has historically never ended well. Idk whether some of you are just apathetic to it or you're just straight and you think the loud gays are annoying but if we let the Brother Rays of the world keep preaching without consequence, people will start listening to what they have to say :/",

This guy is so staunch in his beliefs that he\u2019d be out there one way or another. I think everyone protesting him is in essence just having a bit of fun while resisting the poisonous message he\u2019s spewing. Nobody is going to get through to him, and it\u2019s a little hard for his toxic message to reach people when it\u2019s drowned out by clown music being played over a Bluetooth speaker. Its a perfect messy rejection of what he stands for. Like an internet argument it\u2019s a one way conversation where the crowd spends the entire interaction dunking on him. This guy came onto a diverse campus of progressive young people and decided to spew sexist, racist, and homophobic rhetoric. I\u2019m not at all opposed to people calling him out on his bullshit and making him a laughingstock.",

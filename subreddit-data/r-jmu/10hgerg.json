    "postText": "The vending machines on campus won't let me spend my dining and I'm not sure what the issue is. When I try to spend my dining at the vending machines it says \"balance too low: current balance 0.55\". I checked on mymadison to see where the 0.55 is coming from and apparently it's my \"meal conversion / rollover dining dollars balance.\" However, my actual dining dollars balance is $275 since it just refreshed. Any idea if there's a way I can get the vending machines to stop looking at my rollover balance because currently I can buy nothing and idk how to clear out this account if it's the default or something.",

You could probably do something similar and just get chips or something at market etc. and ask if they could use up your rollover balance",

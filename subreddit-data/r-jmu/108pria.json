It was a **medium or longhaired tabby (brown/black) that was like 2-3 months old, found by one of the dining halls.**\n\nMy friend works for the animal shelter that the kitten was given to, so that's the information I have, but unfortunately cannot provide a picture as I wasn't given one.",

We got its confirmed rabies diagnosis later that week on around the 20-21st. Its intake photo is posted here for anyone to see! Seriously, if this is a cat you or someone on campus interacted with, its saliva making contact with your body is a factor and you should take it into consideration! Don't interact with every cat on campus as rabies is ramping up in Harrisonburg I can confirm!! \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/p3TXll4](https://imgur.com/a/p3TXll4)",

If it\u2019s mouth did not make contact with your skin that produced a puncture and or it\u2019s saliva didn\u2019t make contact with an open wound you should be okay. But at the point of behavior it was showing the day it came in, I\u2019d suspect it was already 2-3 days into the virus. By day 4-5 it was severely affected by the virus and was humanely euthanized. :/",

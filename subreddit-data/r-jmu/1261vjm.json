Your technical and communication skills and your ability to ace interviews are pretty much the only things that matter in terms of internships. Note, I have a swe internship and go here.",

What I care about is practical application and experience. \n\nWill JMU give you better internship opportunities? It\u2019s hard to say. I don\u2019t think any specific \u201cgood college\u201d is going to stand out from the rest as for what jobs will want you to intern with them. \n\nI do think that you will learn much more in a year or two of internship than you would at university, but that\u2019s not a dig at JMU just a truth of practical training. \n\nMy advice would be go to where you want to actually have fun and enjoy your college years. They go by quick and finding a job in CS is only going to be as hard as you make it.",

            "comment": "Senior CS Major here graduating in May. I wouldn\u2019t consider the program a downgrade, it\u2019s a pretty well rounded curriculum and once you get past the easy intro programming classes it gets pretty tough heading into your junior year. They have also changed the intro classes a lot since I was a freshman due to feedback from past CS graduates to better prepare students for the real world (Usually they ask senior volunteers to interview with department heads for how the curriculum can be improved). \n\nIn terms of internships, JMU has lots of partner companies that look to hire JMU students, and they always show up to career fairs, all you have to do is attend them and approach as many tables as possible for internships/jobs. I\u2019ve had no luck with internships, mainly cause I\u2019ve been lazy these past couple semesters (Covid really fucked up my motivation for a while) but this year I\u2019ve been attending career fairs and while I wasn\u2019t lucky last semester, I was able to land 3 interviews for full time jobs this semester (which I\u2019m still waiting to hear back from) and I have peers in the major that have also found successful summer internships and full time jobs in NOVA. One of my good friends actually ended up landing a government cyber defense job this year! \n\nIt\u2019s ultimately up to you though, I picked JMU over VT when I was a high school senior because I wanted to be with friends that I knew locally that were going to be attending and didn\u2019t want to be alone over at Tech, and also because I wanted to be at a moderately sized school over a larger one. JMU has also been on the up and up these past 4 years in terms of exposure (Sports teams have been getting better every year and the number of prospective students have also increased).\n\nTLDR; No, I would say that it does not ruin your internship opportunities, companies mainly care about your project experience, eagerness to learn, and how you will fit into their company. Go wherever you think you will be happiest, Harrisonburg is a great small town!",

            "comment": "Every collage will give you a descent shot at getting internships it\u2019s mostly the skills you have and how you market yourself. Companies want people with specific experience. If you have the skills I think you\u2019ll be a-ok nailing down a job or internship.\n\nNot sure about program prestige. That\u2019ll most likely be the only thing that\u2019d change but you can find that on collage ranking websites. That\u2019s mostly to help you land your first job but it\u2019s not everything.\n\nHonestly I\u2019d go to the place where you feel most comfortable I\u2019m pretty sure both programs will adequately prepare you for the workplace. Seriously as an engineering major believe me you NEED a good work life balance to be successful and happy. If being near friends will do that I\u2019d go with JMU.",

Maybe I'm romanticizing the CS journey I've been on, but I truly believe that JMU's CS department is responsible for the best experiences I've had in tough classes. Can't speak for the much harder Junior year classes.",

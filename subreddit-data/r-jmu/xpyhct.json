A CIS degree is valuable and it has a ton of real world application, so go in with confidence. KPMG, Accenture, Delioitte, Captech, RSM, EY, and Guidehouse are some of the bigger companies that hire CIS majors but if you go on Handshake and look up entry level IT pretty much every company will consider you. Good luck!",

GPA only gets recruiter attention and may get you an interview but they care about what you\u2019ve learned and done more.\n\nAll people in my class landed a job 6 months before graduation. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it and focus on the learning and experience.\n\nCompanies: all tech consulting firms (avoid tech risk if you can) and many tech companies. We had CIS working at Google, Microsoft, Amazon in my year (2018)\n\nLet me know if you have any question",

That doesn\u2019t seem to be common for most roles. I got a second job with AWS 3 months after graduation, and they never asked for my GPA or transcripts. CIS is an incredibly versatile degree and you\u2019ll never find yourself short of companies hiring. Feel free to DM me if you have any interest in careers at AWS or solutions architecture in general.",

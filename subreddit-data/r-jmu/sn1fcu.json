The post was shut down right after that.\n\nPretty hard to have quotes from alumni if alumni don't know what TF is happening.\n\nWhat exactly is going on down there? From what I gather here, it was two suicides in a week.   \n Two suicides in a week is a tragedy that needs to be talked about.  My heart goes out to the families and friends of the students involved.  No parent should bury their child. It's a tragedy for which there is no word in the English language.\n\nMaybe the mod of the FB group thought it was better to stop discussion. I can respect their reasoning. \n\nBut tell us.

We continue to process the loss of one of our students from last week and the tragedy at Bridgewater College.

We offer our deepest condolences to their family and friends.\n \nIn order to give our community the time and space we need, the university will cancel Assessment Day and no classes will be held on Tuesday, Feb. 8. We will also be providing additional spaces for students to meet with counseling professionals experienced with loss during the times below on Tuesday, Feb. 8.\n \nMeeting times and locations for students:\n\u2022\t1 p.m. - 3 p.m. in Taylor 302\n\u2022\t1 p.m. - 3 p.m. in Taylor 303\n\u2022\t1 p.m. - 3 p.m. in Festival Conference room 7\n \nFor additional support please reach out to:\n\u2022\tCounseling Center, 540-568-6552\n\u2022\tDean of Students Office, 540-568-6468\n\u2022\tAfter-hours mental health emergency support, 540-568-6552, press \"1\"\n\u2022\tSentara RMH Emergency Department, 540-689-1414\n\u2022\tSelf-Help resources available through the University Counseling Center\n\u2022\tTAO mental health resources\n\u2022\tCrisis Text Line \u2013 Text HOME to 741741 to reach a crisis counselor\n\u2022\tCounseling Center\u2019s Additional 24/7 Emergency Resource Information\n \nThese difficult moments can often lead to overwhelming feelings and questions.

I had like a 2.6, but guess what? Almost everyone I work with and many random people I talk to tell me how clever I am. Nobody brings up their grades in the real world. Turns out it's way more compelling to do the work when you're getting paid to. \n\nYou are surrounded by so many happy people, but you're not happy. That's not fair! \"Happiest place in earth,\" kinda seems like any other place on earth, but with more drunk college kids. The happiest place on my earth came last year - in the middle of a global pandemic, during a very tumultuous political year, isolated from almost all friends including a former best friend of 10y, in a 875sf apartment I paid way too much for, with a crazy hectic work schedule - when I got my first puppy. This puppy dog fills my heart. \n\nIf you tough it out, then you can find peace. You can earn your way. It might take some time after you graduate, but once you get your foot in the door the dominoes begin to fall. You can get the experience. It's a lot easier to do some bullshit work when you're getting paid to do it. It's a lot easier to sleep when you're allowed to put your work down and pick it back up on Monday. It's a lot easier to take a deep fucking breath after school. \n\nIt seems so trite for me to sit here and type out, \"it gets better,\" so I hope giving examples had more impact. I had my suicide planned. I walked by the spot every week. I had the tools in my backpack every day to string myself up. One day in particular the thing that got me out of bed at 3pm was flipping a coin and it landing on that I was going to kill myself. Now, looking back, I'm glad I came to in time. \n\nThank you for reading my novel.",

Maybe instead of the whole student population sharing the same hotline number, you should take it upon yourself to help others in the jmu community and not be a complete ass. I have been a student at jmu for 4 years now and can count on one hand how many times I've received help from a fellow student. I also was never aware that jmu had any sort of mental health counseling until today. Pretty crazy how it takes two suicides in a week for anyone to acknowledge, or care, that mental heath is a real, very serious issue across any student population. \n\nHaving lived with mental health issues, I can also say that counciling, hotlines, etc. don't help me, and most likely don't help a lot of others like people expect them to. Please don't act like this is the end all be all.\n\nIt's incredibly frustrating that people will try to act like they care about the mental health of others during a tragedy like this, but continue to live their self centered, judgemental lives right after posting the story. \n\nThis problem is far deeper than most people will understand, and the only way anything will ever change is if we stop degrading each other at any chance we get and respect one another. \n\nStarts one person at a time.",

I sit alone all the time and no one offers to sit with me or anything (not that I'm particularly interested, but it would be nice if someone asked, and not just out of pity or something as they usually do). It's always \"Check on your friends,\" but what about those who don't have friends (like myself)? There's no one to check on them. And saying \"It gets better\" is just a useless platitude no one wants to hear. The problem with suicide hotlines is that (if you even get a response) they feed you generic responses to your problems and likely use the same script for everyone. (Trigger warning here: SH) I used to self harm in the past and texted a suicide hotline because I was having serious suicidal thoughts and she made the incorrect assumption that I cut myself (I didn't, I strangled myself) so her responses to me were just anti-cutting stuff, completely useless and not pertaining to my situation at all. They don't care about your individual situation, they just give the same responses to everyone. People don't take the time to genuinely care, they're lazy and will say \"You're loved\" even though they can't prove that either. The sad reality is that people simply say things but don't actually act. And \"mental health days\" do nothing, either.",

Meanwhile, the first CHOICES event of the spring admissions season is in less than two weeks and they will have to convince prospective students and their parents to commit to JMU despite two on-campus suicides and a school shooting just down the highway in the span of a week. Before his retirement, Charlie King was [explicitly worried](https://www.breezejmu.org/business/covid-19-delays-jmu-construction-but-ambitious-expansion-ahead/article_1ddd1700-358a-11eb-b1d8-8f5f6e93cb73.html) about JMU being able to keep up with their debt service payments if enrollment didn't remain steady.\n\nCounselors aren't a magic fix, but there are *so* many students on campus who *want* to see counselors and address their mental health concerns but are turned away due to lack of resources. You can't focus on big picture things like community and personal growth and friendship when you can barely even get out of bed in the morning. You can't hold someone else up if you're drowning.\n\nI will work on getting all of that peer-reviewed and submitted to a publication of your choosing so it's more legitimate, just let me know which one. \ud83d\udc4d\n\n--\n\nEdit: changed \"deficit is\" to \"deficit was\" in the first sentence since apparently JMU's auditing team is auditing the subreddit too. \ud83e\udd74",

And certainly not to counseling.\nUniversities don\u2019t advertise suicides because it\u2019s not always  good practice to make statements about them. \nSo many people are coming into schools these days without basic coping skills. It takes more than counseling at any one university to help with that issue. Universities can\u2019t offer full time counseling services to anyone want who wants it just like they can\u2019t offer full time medical services.\nIt\u2019s a triage unit, but for some reasons everything thinks it\u2019s supposed to be something else. Meanwhile the cost of higher education is skyrocketing. \n\nFull on reform MIGHT fix some of these issues. But what gets cut? And what if the the actual peer reviewed literature says adding millions of dollars to counseling services won\u2019t actually fix the problem?",

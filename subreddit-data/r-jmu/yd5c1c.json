    "postText": "We have signed a lease at The Harrison, a complex recommended by a friend (now JMU graduate) who lived there for the past two years. The 4-bedroom, two-bath apartment is fully furnished with amenities including a gym, pool, and in-unit laundry. Assuming a parking pass is needed, each student will pay about $445/month.   We are in the Honors College on pre-professional tracks and hope to keep a clean and considerate space.  While we aren't into large gatherings, we enjoy roller-skating, bowling, movies, Netflix, JMU sports and clubs, hikes, climbing at UREC, group meals, concerts and plays, game nights, and Mario Kart.   PM me if you'd like to share contact information.",

I\u2019m in a crap tone of clubs w/ leadership positions. I work part-time. My essay was good\u2026 I worked on it for months. I had a great letter of rec from a teacher I trusted. I did everything I could and I got rejected. Only thing I didn\u2019t do was submit my SAT score because that was terrible. Even though I\u2019ve been accepted into other colleges, jmu was my dream. I feel awful lol.",

The applicant pool is rough, especially post covid with an influx of applications.\n\nPerhaps you just weren\u2019t what they were looking for. Maybe they had too many people apply to your major? It could be a million different things but it\u2019s not a reflection on you.\n\nI was rejected from my top school and so I ended up at JMU. Wherever you go, it\u2019ll end up great. You\u2019re obviously a great candidate for most, so while it absolutely does hurt that this door closed, many are still open. \n\nWhat really helped me when I was first rejected is looking up good things about my other options (eg; for me it was googling the pros of JMU).",

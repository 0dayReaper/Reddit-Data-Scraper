I am an admitted student for the fall - I am confused about how roommates are selected - do we fill out a questionnaire and get matched or have to find it on our own? just dont want to wait too long if i need to find one - someone said you pick a room and someone else picks the \"other half\" - that seems odd so I am unsure how it works. thx!",

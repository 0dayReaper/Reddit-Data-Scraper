    "postText": "I am planning to relet my apartment at The Harrison for this summer since I am taking asynchronous classes and therefore will not need it. It is a 4-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment with a kitchen, washer and dryer, queen-sized mattress, and HVAC system. The lease would go until July 31. If you are taking classes in the summer and you need a place to stay, I am here to help. Please DM me for details.",

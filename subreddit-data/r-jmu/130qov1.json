    "postText": "Look at how far we have come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOriginal post - [https://www.reddit.com/r/jmu/comments/shjfrb/to\\_ras\\_and\\_undergrad\\_hds/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/jmu/comments/shjfrb/to_ras_and_undergrad_hds/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wrote a post about a year ago on r/JMU explaining the disparities within the RA and undergrad HD jobs at JMU compared to other colleges. I have not stopped fighting, nor do I intend to stop. This problem will continue and changes will continue to be made even after I graduate. \n\nI would like to say thank you to Dirron Allen, the AVP of ORL among other things for being so open and increasing transparency to all of the RAs and HDs in the process that is happening. I also want to mention that within 48 hours of the original post going live, Dirron was already in contact with me, which is something I will never forget.\n\nI would like to say thank you to Kathleen Campbell for during her first year as the acting Director of ORL she had to basically fist fight with the RAs and undergrad HDs because of the extreme backlash that was released. \n\nThe other associate directors within ORL deserve acknowledgment, for without their work we wouldn't be where we are now. \n\nMost of all, thank you to everyone who made this happen, what started as a discussion in Shenandoah Hall last year about our conditions, has turned to outright change because of YOU.\n\nAs it pertains to university employees and government employees who are relatively low-level, we have been able to show our force in a way that has created real positive progress. We have no control over the state of VAs budget as it relates to JMU, JMUs allocation of funds to departments, and ORLs allocation of funds to their different departments. With that said, all of our effort wasn't for nothing, and real change is being made, and real change will continue to be made. I know this as I meet with Dirron Allen frequently, and I have had sporadic meetings with Kathleen Campbell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I want to highlight just a few of the things that have happened in only the span of a year -** \n\n**RA Parking** \n\n**A bonus this year, despite only having about 7 open RA positions**\n\n**Expanded meal plan options for RAs** \n\n**The advisory board that meets with Dirron every month where RAs, HDs, and residents voice what could change and what has changed**\n\n**Increased room rent reduction for 23'-24' RAs**\n\n**Weekly open discussions with Kathleen Campbell where you can discuss issues with her, and she takes the feedback she receives very seriously**\n\n**Quality of life improvements (Looking into minifridges and upgrading furniture in RA offices)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese changes all happened within a year, and they happened because of everyone here, they happened because of the staff of last year voicing their concern, the staff of this year voicing their concern, and they happened at the direct hands of Dirron Allen, Kathleen Campbell, and ORL associate directors. They have made a real positive change.\n\nThere are things still missing. As room rent reduction increases the pay is more substantial for our RAs who need the money for college. ORL still needs a better understanding of a typical RAs role in duty tours and how it relates to the training we receive, though there's a plan in motion to make that happen. They especially need to waive the $40 fee for RAs to sign the housing contract, and they need to stop sending critical emails on Friday afternoons to us, then closing the entire weekend, amongst other things. Though these are real changes that can be easily made, and I'm sure they will be made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no complaints. We have done what needed to be done, and while we may have made a bit of noise, I would go back and still do it the same way all over again. I want everyone to use this opportunity to think about your own personal involvement, the involvement of ORL pro staff, and the involvement of AVP Dirron Allen, for without them we would still have nothing. We have more than nothing now, we have outlets, we have ways to voice our concerns unlike anytime before. We all made this change happen, and it will continue to happen judging by my personal meetings with Kathleen Campbell, Dirron Allen, and this year's new and returning RAs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you to everyone for making this happen. I believe with the structures put in place by Dirron Allen and Kathleen Campbell I can finally step back and breathe, it is best if you use these outlets and tell the truth. Change can't be made if the truth isn't told.",

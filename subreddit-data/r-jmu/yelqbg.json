    "postText": "So It's Virginia College application week and I'm pretty much ready to submit except I am on the fence about joining the honors college. Now on the books, I look like someone who would join the Honors college but I don't want to be as stressed as I have been in High School. \n\nOn one hand, I have been doing honors/ap/ib all my life and know what I want to do later on in life it may look nice to have this honors college under my belt but I just don't know if I want to continue on this track. Though I have taken all these extra courses in High School, I wanted university to also be fun for me. I didn't have the social life I wanted due to being in the IB program as my friends would stay home to work on school or study well I wanted to go out. While I do take education seriously and I don't plan on rushing, I do want to go out to parties, games, join clubs, etc. I just don't know if being in this Honors college would let me do all the things I would like to do. My parents said I shouldn't as I have already been stressed while my peers are doing the honor college. I just don't know what to do so can I have some advice. \n\nStats: 4.2 - GPA (I am a part of the IB program)\n I am in four extracurricular activities; swim (co-captain), debate, announcement team (president), and NHS. \nSAT: 1180 (I'm not putting it in though)\nVolunteer hours: 137 \nMajor: Political Science(pre-law track)(still up for change but mainly what I want)",

You just do one gen-ed per semester with the honors designation \u2014 which in my experience means smaller class size, more writing, and higher grades. The community is nice, early enrollment is great, and you can drop it at any time. The harder part of honors starts your junior year with a research project. This is also doable imo but you have time to decide.",

People might party less but it\u2019s not because they don\u2019t have time and they are generally smart and nice. My reason for liking honors is because of the people - especially the advisors and staff. I got plugged into great scholarships, leadership opportunities, and the best advising because of the HC. Don\u2019t overlook the potential for networking and money if you can get involved heavily. Other people here are totally right, just listing honors on your resume isn\u2019t all that impressive. If you get very involved- think becoming a TA, trying for a Hillcrest scholarship, or applying for a Fulbright, this is the place to be with experienced people that will really care about you IMO.",

If you\u2019re a real go getter academically and thrive with challenging yourself in school, it\u2019s a good fit. If you aren\u2019t sure about what you want and are more exploratory, it would probably be more beneficial to do what you\u2019re saying and try out some classes and even go for a minor that you think sounds interesting.",

As Bookish said, the requirements initially as your getting acclimated are pretty light, and benefits are great. It gives you a minor at the end, and your research project can also be aligned with your major.  Definitely apply. You can apply and get an offer to the Honors College and then later decide if you want to take that offer.",

I\u2019d focus on getting as close to a 4.0 as possible and what you want to do with you life post undergrad as the strategic goal. Tactical goal is making friends and try things out on the way.",

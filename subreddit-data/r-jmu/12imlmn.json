            "comment": "not a current student so i\u2019m not sure if this is still the case. d-hall second floor has an allergen free station where you would be able to avoid milk and eggs. the rotating station by the bmash would sometimes have vegan options especially if it\u2019s asian cuisine. e-hall always has at least one option if i remember correctly. freshens and blue ridge bowl are good options since the food is only minorly prepared before being added to your bowl. also don\u2019t be afraid to ask. dining managers and chefs are super helpful in my experience and should all theoretically have ingredient info on site. some places have milk and cheese alternatives. i came to jmu a vegetarian and left almost vegan so it\u2019s possible but you do have to be careful. anyone please correct me if i\u2019m wrong",

            "comment": "Vegan options in my experience are not as diverse and glorious as jmu makes it out as. There's a single station in dhall called \"plant forward\" where they keep their main vegan dish of the day. Usually things like kungpao cauliflower thing, vegan Mac n cheese, vegan quesadilla, and one vegan dessert (brownie, cookie, etc.)\n\nMy personal opinion is that the options are dry in numbers and dry in moisture. Once they had simple white rice at this station. Crunched like raw, uncooked rice or plastic rice from 5- minute crafts. \n\nVarious other options dotted around campus, but definitely difficult to be vegan without further aid from staff.",

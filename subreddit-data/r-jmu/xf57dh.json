    "postText": " I have a few questions about this process.  \n\n1-When do the students start looking for off campus housing for next year?    How far in advance does this process start?\n\n2-Approx, what percentage (best guess) of Sophomores move off-campus vs stay on campus?\n\n3- What apartment complex's  are mostly rented by students? Or what complex's are the popular one's with the JMU students. \n\n4-Do student rent local houses? or is it just apartments? \n\n5-is it cheaper to move off vs stay on campus? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time and the help here!!!!",

            "comment": "1. You should honestly already start looking, the sooner the better\n2. I\u2019d say about 75/80% of sophomores move off campus, all of my on campus friends that are sophomores are RAs\n3. Red point (known as the retreat), south view/north view, the harrison, there\u2019s a lot on complexes\n4. I personally rent a local house cause it\u2019s cheaper for more space and i know a good amount of students that do but if you want to rent you have to be early, start looking now\n5. I think it\u2019s cheaper in the long run to stay off campus",

            "comment": "1. asap, ideally by october if you want to live anywhere w units in high demand (i.e Charleston) or once you know who you like to be living with\n2. most sophomores move off campus. there is really no point to continuing to live on campus unless you are an RA\n3. there are many choices! i personally do not recommend the Hills - the buildings are old and we dealt with a lot of mold. I did like North 38 although it was a little far from campus. Charleston is probably the best for the value. Others are the Retreat (more expensive), the Mill, Grace St (many sophomores here), Altitude (more expensive), and Sunchase (also nice). \n4. renting a house is also a good idea! you can save a lot of money, but you do not have some perks that come w apts like on demand maintenance.\n5. in the end it\u2019s cheaper to be off campus. you get way more space too than if you were in a dorm",

            "comment": "Most students sign a lease before the year is up, so I would start looking now. Most sophomores move off campus, I did and LOVED it. Check out Pheasant Run, it\u2019s got so much more space for a way better price than other apartment complexes. Students do rent houses, but renting an apartment may be easier for students because there is more consistent upkeep and other services available. Def cheaper to live off campus",

Altitude is a great first choice for apartments but it is a little far off campus and port republic is a bitch \n4. Houses are good but unless your real estate savvy I\u2019d  recommend sticking with a flat rate apartment, just saves on extra stress\u2026 remember you\u2019re in college\n5. Off campus is cheaper no matter how you spin it.",

Nightmare apartments, moldy, leaky pipes, floors caved and management just doesn\u2019t care.",

            "comment": "1. It\u2019s good to start thinking about it soon, like around October. As someone else mentioned, the most important step at this point is figuring out roommates. Don\u2019t feel pressured to sign right away though, make sure you feel confident in your choice of housing and roommates. \n\n2. 60-70% move off campus. But a percentage of those who live on campus live in grace street apartments\n\n3. Pretty much any four bedroom complex in the area is frequented by students\n\n4. Yes, but an apartment might be easier for your first year off campus. Many of them include utilities, and there\u2019s less maintenance involved for you (don\u2019t have to mow the lawn, etc.)\n\n5. Assuming your rent is around 500 a month and you don\u2019t get a meal plan, living off campus is cheaper.  However, if you choose to live somewhere more expensive or choose to purchase a commuter meal plan, it could be comparable or more expensive",

Campus view up there as well but there gym and pool are not as nice but if you don\u2019t care about those things go campus view.",

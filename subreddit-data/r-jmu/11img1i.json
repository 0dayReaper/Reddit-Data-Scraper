    "postText": "So I plan on going to JMU, and I was accepted into the honors college and would be staying in Shenandoah Hall. When I go onto the \u201cfloor plans\u201d for Shenandoah they all are \u201cdouble\u201d style rooms, however, when you click \u201cGo inside Shenandoah\u201d it lets you take a look at a single room option. Is there an option for single rooms at Shenandoah???",

There was one single dorm at the end of my hall and the guy who lived there had a disability accommodation that would\u2019ve made having a roommate impossible, so I\u2019m pretty sure there isn\u2019t a way to just pick a single dorm, though I may be wrong. I would suggest picking a corner room on the side facing ehall. Hella bigger than the other rooms",

I highly recommend living in Shenandoah, I\u2019ve met my best friends here and it\u2019s been an overall good experience and significantly better experience than others living in other dorms",

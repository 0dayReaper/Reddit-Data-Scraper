My friends in accounting worked as hard as the engineering students but they were well prepared for the cpa from my understanding. The Masters program is quite competitive so most people do a double major to reach 150 hours to qualify for the cpa.",

Financial and managerial accounting is required for most business majors so you\u2019ll take those as your first two accounting classes. You\u2019ll definitely get a feel for the program with those two classes but the higher up classes is where you\u2019ll being putting most of your effort into",

In COB I liked village but it doesn\u2019t matter much. Id highly recommend getting involved first semester because Cob gets tougher for people after that, but make sure you do well in Econ because you need a 2.7 GPA to get into Cob 300",

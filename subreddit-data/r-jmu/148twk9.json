    "postText": "Hi, I'm about to be a senior in the CS department and I recently got accepted into the Virginia tech partnership Masters program. I have a lot of questions about what I might be getting into if I accept. If anyone is currently in the program, can y'all share with me your opinion on what you think of it and what the pros and cons are for this program? \n\nI have no idea where I work or where I will end up at the end of the next school year, so I feel hesitant to take any sort of leap of faith into this program I know little about. \n\nThanks!",

As a female, hair can certainly be a slight issue and idk about the guys. Otherwise, it\u2019s fine. They\u2019re clean and everyone respects your space and so it\u2019s chill. I never had to wait on a shower or a stall. Obviously you lack a level of privacy but everyone sorta has a mutual understand of \u201cthis is a bathroom shared by everyone else, I\u2019m not gonna be a dick\u201d",

She\u2019s cleaned the bathroom maybe three times this entire year but honestly it\u2019s just easier to clean it myself than be confrontation lol. Takes like 20 min to deep clean because it\u2019s pretty small. Also the train tracks are annoying but it\u2019s nice to be close to dhall and the quad. Also proximity to the bus stop is nice! The train is really annoying for me, it does a high pitch squeak and can be scary in the middle of the night but I just wear earplugs to bed",

It has that historic piece of the university, you are right on the quad, and you will have that Jack &amp; Jill style bathrooms. Truly, the train is only insanely loud if you have your window open 24/7, so not to worry there. I live directly on the quad in Harper Allen-Lee and have never heard a noise from the stadium nor from the MRDs when they practice on the quad before the game (I don\u2019t know how but that was also my biggest worry). Sometimes it can be a little weird about \u201cwho\u2019s turn is it to clean the bathroom?\u201d but that\u2019s where your suitemate contract comes in!! Let me know if you have other questions!",

The only time I heard football games was when I opened the door. The train terrible, it was something I was easily able to adapt to.",

You only share a bathroom with 2 suite mates and your roommates and it\u2019s accessible to your room which is really nice. I never really had a problem sharing as we all just showered and used the bathroom at different times. To me it\u2019s better because you have actual privacy and can lock the door to the other room while you shower. The location is great if your classes are on main campus and it\u2019s right next to dhall. I didn\u2019t find the noise bothersome and I\u2019m a light sleeper and spent a lot of time in my dorm. It is near the train but as long as your windows are closed it\u2019s not bothersome. I really recommend living there! My sister also lived in Wayland and really enjoyed it too.",

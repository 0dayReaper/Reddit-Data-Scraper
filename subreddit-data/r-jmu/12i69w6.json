            "comment": "so there\u2019s a double degree and a double major, and they\u2019re different. i\u2019m currently doing a double degree, so i need 150 credit hours to graduate. if you\u2019re doing a double major but only getting one degree, you only need the regular 120 hours but you need to fill the requirements for both majors. \n\nfor my double degree, i\u2019ve been doing mostly 18-19 credit hour semesters, which i\u2019m able to handle but might not be for everyone. i\u2019m also going to be doing summer courses the next 2 years, and i did them last year. i\u2019m only doing 2 summer classes each year, so around 6-7 credits per summer. \n\nit\u2019s very doable, but talk to your advisor !",

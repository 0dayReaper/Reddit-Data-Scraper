Your GPA is astounding and if you have some extracurriculars to round you out, you have a great shot of acceptance.\n\nBut where you really guarantee it is the personal essay. Good or bad grades, if you write an amazing essay, you\u2019re set.",

Something to note is that I am not a VA student, I came from PA. You say you have had a challenging course schedule, hopefully that includes at least 2 AP courses? Overall, I would say you have a good chance of being accepted! Catch you on campus next fall dude.",

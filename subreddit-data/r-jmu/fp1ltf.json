So sadly I don't have the QR Kiosk yet, so I'll give you this little album  \n\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/LlPaRLT](https://imgur.com/a/LlPaRLT)  \n\n\nBasically what I did was take the Stripped Cap and then palette swapped it, then made the JMU letting you see there, same for the sweater.  I took the fluffy sweater and just palette swapped it to the muted purple and gold.  \n\n\nI was extremely lazy because graphic design is NOT my passion  \n\n# (\u25e1 \u203f \u25e1 \u273f)",

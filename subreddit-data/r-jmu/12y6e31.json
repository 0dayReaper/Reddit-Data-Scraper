            "comment": "I did the Germany summer before freshman year and LOVED it. Flying international isn\u2019t too bad - just make sure all your passport stuff is up to date - but the airports at the other end have english on their signs, so you won\u2019t get lost. Everyone arrives on the same day/roughly the same time, so you have transportation provided from the moment you land to the moment you leave. \n\nYou do have to pay for your own flight - if this is a financial concern, email the Center for Global Engagement and they can give you more information. They\u2019ll probably also give you some tips to find cheaper flights! \n\nSleep on the plane if you can - the time difference means that you\u2019ll likely be arriving morning or mid-afternoon when your body clock is closer to 3am. Stay awake when you land or getting adjusted will be hard (it took us three days to fully adjust, but it\u2019s different for everyone). \n\nIt\u2019s typically a pretty small group, so you can quickly meet everyone and have a core group when you come to campus in the fall. We didn\u2019t stay best friends after the program ended, but we did all sit together during orientation week until we made new friends! Every trip is different, but our group hung out most of the time when walking to and from class, going out to eat, etc. \n\nAs for the content itself: you\u2019ll get to work with some super cool people (German &amp; American), visit different cities, and you do get free time to explore the place you\u2019re at. We did guided tours, watched movies, went to museums, markets, etc. Since it\u2019s a partnership with a German university, there will be English speaking guides that can help translate (and they\u2019ll give you a crash course in German on your first day of class). You don\u2019t have to know German to be successful; but feel free to brush up on some basic words to feel more comfortable. \n\nOverall, loved it. It was a great way to kick off freshman year and introduced college in a fun way. If you have any questions about the travel portion or the experience, I\u2019d be happy to answer.",

I disliked not being able to drive at first but I got use to it pretty quickly. While I did trace solo, people there were nice and most spoke English to some degree. I don\u2019t remember a lick of German.",

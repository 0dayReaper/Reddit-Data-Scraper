Some of the city buses may service around where the gray line used to run and North 38 has its own shuttle if you live there, so unfortunately you\u2019ll probably have to work with those options for the time being",

That should drop you off pretty close to [this CVS](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tnkgeM8Rz2KAwoKS8?g_st=ic).",

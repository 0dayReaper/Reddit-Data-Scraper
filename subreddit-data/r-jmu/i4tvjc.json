    "postText": "TL;DR I love the students, professors, support staff of JMU and want you all to be safe and healthy.  Fuck the administration for putting you in danger.  Stay home, stay safe, don't attend this semester.\n\nI am an alum and during my time I have come to love the students, staff, and professors (honestly most of my professors were pretty solid) of JMU and the Harrisonburg +valley community.  You all have helped me become a better person, citizen, and professional.  I have learned about topics I never dreamed of when I was growing up and learned a lot about myself.  But I have come to absolutely despise JMU's administration.\n\nFrom continuously rising academic costs to attend, nickle-and-dime-ing students, difficulty navigating admins with regards to my chronic illness, consistent disregard for diversity, inability to handle sexual harassment cases and for prioritizing unsustainable construction and expansion over the quality and cost of your education, there is no love for JMU's administration from me.  They now have added another item why I will never donate or promote JMU as an institution and that is the bullshit way that they are handling the pandemic for the Fall semester.\n\nJMU moved to online-learning when there were 4,000 cases, but now want to open up when there are over 4.7 million total cases in the US and over 150,000 deaths.  More people have died in 6 months of this virus than US combat deaths in WW1 (US involvement lasted roughly a year and a half).  Schools were shut down when the attacks on 9/11 occurred, but to me it is absurd that schools would open in the middle of a pandemic that to-date has taken almost 50 TIMES MORE US LIVES THAN THE 9/11 TERRORIST ATTACKS.\n\nJMU's opening plan is not realistic, and they don't care about your health.\n\nSeriously, my office has more strict requirements than JMU's 8 day quarantine plan.  My office requires 14 minimum days if you are exposed, a doctor's note, and we have been also WFH since March.  How is JMU going to even enforce that?  An honor-pledge?  The Honor-pledge didn't stop cheating at JMU last I checked. \n\nJMU wants you to come back because that is how THEY MAKE MONEY.   They are willing to trade your health/lives for cash.  Believe it or not that despite the amount they charge you, JMU is strapped for cash.   They have invested so much money in land/infrastructure that they need you to physically be there in order to make money from the services of the land/infrastructure (think dorms, parking, meal plans, UREC, etc.)  This is the down-side of modern american higher-education.  \n\nThe flashy and luxurious campuses/dorms/amenities are how they attract students to come to their school and they charge you for it.  It's an amenities arms-race honestly.  When I did my college tours in 2013, literally every school I visited had \"inner-tube water-polo\" as a selling point.  What about the academics? The reason most European universities are cheap because they are literally 5 big fucking concrete buildings that you go do hw in, take tests, study, do labs and get the fuck out from.  You don't have to walk 15 minutes to get one section from campus to the other.  My family from Europe has commented that my school is its own city! That's not normal anywhere else on the planet.  The land and buildings aren't cheap.  The school gets grants to build/buy this but guess who gets to pay the maintenance costs + taxes!  You do!\n\nGoing virtual would upend the years of the \"amenities\" arms-race I was talking about and make it moot.  it would completely shatter the illusion you need all that land/facility/fancy bullshit that they tack on to justify increasing your tuition each year.  It is not your responsibility to bear the brunt of JMU's poor financial decision-making!\n\nWhat can you do while not at JMU?\n\nNothing during this pandemic is ideal, but the best we can do is mitigate a semester or two off.\n\nTake online courses/gen-eds from community colleges.  It is not too late to enroll.  To underclassmen/underclasswomen, you can knock out your geneds cheaper and usually easier, but make sure you check in with your registrars office first.  Even if you miss the regular deadlines, Community colleges also organize some courses by first 6 weeks and last 6 weeks, you might be able to snag some of those courses; do be warned they may be accelerated.  Your quality of education is already going to be crippled this year, its not worth paying all this money to start your academic career like this.\n\nTo upperclassman/upperclasswomen - you can take a semester or two off.  This is absolutely a valid option and don't let people bully you into not considering it!  The \"you will be behind argument\" is bullshit.  Behind who exactly?  The millions of other people who are trying to survive this pandemic? It took me 5.5 years to graduate, I took extended time away from school for health reasons and I came back to finish what I started.  If you have a direction in mind I am certain that you will complete your education even if you take a semester or two off.  Again check with your registrar.  I took a semester off without my loan's interest kicking in or having to re-enroll at JMU.\n\nNon-profit organizations are always looking for volunteers.  Meetup dot com (sorry dont know the subreddits rule for links) is a great place to find orgs that you can network, volunteer, and practice your skillset or find one if you are willing to explore.  Highly recommend, this is also how I found my current job.\n\nThe risks of returning\n\nYour health, obviously, but it is a bit more nuanced than that.  You could be lucky and and never catch it.  You could be extremely unlucky, catch it, and die.  Are those the dice you want to roll?  Lets also explore the in-between options.  You could be asymptomatic and pass it to no one.  You could be asymptomatic and start a whole another cluster by passing it on to other people.  You could get sick and recover quickly, or you could be sick and be on a ventilator for 51 days and lord-knows what other complications you could develop down the line (read the NY Times article \"51 days on a ventilator\").  I don't know about you but when I went to school the most I had to worry about was catching the common cold.  \n\nThe quality of your education is going to suffer.  Stressed and sick professors don't make for good lecturers.  Chaos is not a good learning environment.  You are spending exorbitant amounts of money (and loans that accrue interest!) to get less in return.  \n\nMy recommendation.\n\nThe only way I can in good conscious recommend attending JMU this year is if everything is online and virtual.  JMU has not announced that it is starting online, while UVA has.  This will be the only time I endorse UVA over JMU and urge you to consider a transfer (or to any accredited school that is doing online-only during the pandemic!) or start at a Community College.  Absolutely no shame in that.  What JMU is doing is appalling and the implication of money &gt; your safety is a terrible precedent to set.\n\nClosing\n\nI write this because I care.  I care about the health of the students, faculty, support staff.  I care about the quality of your education. You made me the person I am today and I am pissed that my own (the students,support staff, faculty) are being put in harms way unnecessarily.   I care that you are getting unnecessarily fucked by the powers to be just because they said so.  I learned from JMU to question authority, even if that authority is JMU.  I wrote this because I cannot do nothing in the face of wrong; it would weigh on my conscious if I didn't voice my thoughts/concerns and maybe help someone stay safe. \n\n Dukes step-up.  Stay home, stay safe.",

Do not pay 4X to go to a JMU summer camp for two weeks and get sent home to do the same exact thing. You will not get the freshman experience the rest of us got. No Halloween, no football, no going out, none of it.

                    "comment": "Good questions, I am glad you brought them up.  Like I said in my post, these are not ideal times, we can only mitigate damage for the most part. If you can take your classes online - highly recommend it.  If you have to fall under full-time status, do it, you have 6 months to return to full-time status before your loan payments kick in.  Better to be safe than sick.  You might have to take may-mester classes to \"catch up\" (catch up to what though, life is a marathon not a sprint).\n\nWhether you like it or not - you may be graduating late. This is a no-win scenario. The quality of your education is going to be affected.  If you get sick or come in contact with someone who is sick, you are going to quarantine for 2 weeks and be doing classwork online anyway.  I can imagine that you will be required to do multiple quarantines if multiple outbreaks occur on campus.  If your professor is sick, then what? You're going to be missing instruction.  If you are extremely unlucky, you'll be in the hospital where graduating on-time will be the last thing on your mind.  Either way, your quality of education this semester is not going to be as good as pre-pandemic. For that reason alone it is worth postponing your plans.\n\n Let me tell you a bit about my story and why I am glad I didn't stick to my path and graduate on time.  I started out music and realized a year in that I hated it.  Switched majors and started from scratch.  Started International Relations and hated that too.  Then I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease and was too ill to go to school.  During my time off i recovered and found my path (IT/software dev - took a course on a whim at a community college). I am glad I took time off because \n\n1) i could explore my career options freely\n\n 2) while I was sick I couldn't learn - I wasn't getting anything out of my education, much like how the quality of your instruction will suffer through the sheer chaos of the times we live in and how unprepared JMU was in response.  They had all summer to set up infrastructure and they pissed the opportunity away.  \n\n3) I realized graduating on-time and adhering to other people's expectations and time-frames is bullshit and trying to keep up expectations/appearances was exhausting.  When I was accepted into the CoB and did COB 300 I met people who were 24, 28, and 32 years old.  Some were military, some dropped out earlier and decided they wanted to finish, some just took longer.  Mind you Cob300 is just a bit after the halfway point in the school business majors.  These people were graduating at 26, 30, 34 years old. All three of those people are doing EXCELLENT in their careers and are extremely mature professionals.  It took me 5.5 years to complete and I have no regrets for it.  \n\nIf i stayed the course and graduated on time, I would have finished with a major I hated and I would have despised my entire time here because I was sick and not getting anything out of it.\n\nThere is no shame in graduating late, pushing to graduate on time for the sake of it is not worth your well-being and health and you won't get as much out of it education-wise.  You have your entire life to graduate and do good in this world. How long it took doesn't matter, especially during these strange times.  There is no gradution-on-time-police.  No one cares how long it took you.\n\nDo keep busy - or take the semester off.  Believe me with a full time job it is harder to take vacay than I realized.  Take advantage of the part-time semester or entire semester off.\n\n Finding a volunteer organization you can safely contribute is one route.  I volunteered software dev at local non-profits and went to \"code and coffees\" I found at [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) (they have all since become virtual).  I ended up meeting someone who hired me at these events.  If you have an internship, reach out to the internship host org and let them know you can continue working with the organization if they'd have you.  If you free-lance or have a side-gig, I highly recommend engaging in that.  I am in no ways suggesting being idle, although that could also be a possibility. if you want to rest, take advantage of it now.",

People aren\u2019t going to wear masks, corners are going to be cut with quarantining and cleaning...students return to classes the same week thousands of students are returning from various different places(some having the virus and not knowing or coming in contact with those who are sick). It doesn\u2019t make any sense, how is money more valuable than thousands of lives? Baffled to be an alum from this school that praises its educational stats but can\u2019t even be smart enough to stay online",

They aren\u2019t forcing anyone to do anything. It\u2019s really just student choice whether to attend or not. I choose to attend. I appreciate the concern; felt like it came with good intentions. I\u2019ve done my research and I\u2019m happy with my decision.",

The lack of transparency, enforceable rules/plan, and slow communication would make me wary.  \n\nAs for concern, you'll probably witness a disappointing lack of it from your peers.  We couldn't keep it classy during either of our game days.  Not a problem unique to JMU unfortunately.",

    "postText": "So currently I am in engineering and calculus 1 is just too much for me. I spoke to my advisor and they said that it may interest me to look into the ISAT major and I did.\n\nhow hard is...\n\nISAT 151. Topics in Applied Calculus in ISAT \\[C3QR\\]  -&gt; Compared to Calculus 1\n\nISAT 152. Topics in Applied Physics in ISAT -&gt; Compared to Physics 1 (and is there a lab class)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand separately how challenging is ISAT 251. Topics in Applied Statistics in ISAT  \n\n(yes I did just copy the names from the website)\n\nAnd just how is the curriculum compared to engineering?\n\nAlso if anyone sees this who has also transferred from engineering to ISAT please tell me about your experience with it whether you are a alumni or current student I would really like some insight!",

I was an energy and bio systems double concentration, and ended up working at a green building firm that assists buildings in becoming LEED certified. I don\u2019t know definitively, but I\u2019m fairly confident that ISAT would be able to prepare you for the kind of work you\u2019d find at Dominion. Good luck!",

Came back to represent the company at the recent career fair and my boss (also a JMU grad) had no idea what ISAT was. I know it\u2019s a fantastic program, and the people in it know that as well, but you may run into the issue of needing to explain what your major was to anyone looking to hire and you may not have the instant recognition of something like engineering, biology, or geology.\n\nAgain ISAT is a fantastic program and if you think it\u2019s right for you go for it. I just wanted to give you an idea of what you may run into in the future",

I took applied calculus in high school, and the ISAT 151 course was almost exactly the same as the applied Calc course I took in high school. The only big difference was that it is also a lab class. \n\nISAT 152 is the ISAT version of Physics 1, and it is a lab class. \n\nI'm currently taking ISAT 251 with Professor Simmons. She offers plenty of time outside of class for help sessions and office hours, so as of right now the class isn't to stressful if you utilize those office hours. \n\nI know that a few students in my classes were engineering majors that transferred to ISAT, so it's not uncommon for engineering students to switch to ISAT, and if you are looking for more information about ISAT I would talk to Mr Henriksen! \n\nIf you need help with homework, test prep, etc I would definitely check out the Math and Science tutoring center in the SSC! I personally have had a good experience there getting help with homework and test prep, so regardless of if you stay in engineering or switch to ISAT, I would definitely check out their services! The writing center and the communications center are just as helpful too!",

            "comment": "1. See ['Required Courses'](https://catalog.jmu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=50&amp;poid=21474) , honestly i'd say the required courses give you a pretty good idea/enough knowledge to understand junior level work. Depending on your job there might be a decent amount of learning on the job.\n2. If you're an average student I'd say everything is a 4.5-5/10. But COB 291, CIS 331 and CIS 484 might give you a hard time depending on how much you're willing to learn. I'd say for those classes it could get to like a 7.0 or maybe 8.0/10 difficulty as an average JMU student. Again lots of factors such as your classmates/teammates for CIS 484 and who you get for your professor for COB 291.\n3. Minor in CS or BSAN would be very helpful imo. CS minor if you want to consider SWE or more technical roles and BSAN if you're set on Data Analytics/Science.\n4. No reason to do grad school or certs (for the most part) in the tech industry. But I guess there are research opportunities within COB/CIS if you want to do that.\n5. Network with recruiters whenever they come to campus and join business clubs or 'frats'. AIS is a good place to start\n\nEverything considered, its a solid major. IMO its the best major at JMU **IF** you're considering the ratio of major difficulty to starting pay + long term career outlook. I'm making north of 200k as a Product Manager \\~1.8 years out of college and pretty much fucked around in college doing the bare minimum.",

Entry level at $70k-$80k at a consulting firm.\n\n2. Promotion after a year or two $90k-$100k.\n\n3. After 3-5 years second promotion to like $100k-$130k. At this stage it\u2019s most useful to hop to a different company since they\u2019ll be spamming you on LinkedIn now and you can get a higher pay bump. \n\n4. Go into management or continue with senior roles after 5+ years. $160k - $200k. After this it\u2019s a lot more variable since senior manager positions aren\u2019t as cookie cutter.",

            "comment": "Late reply but here\u2019s info I have after graduating back about 4 years ago:\n\nQuestions For Grad/Current CIS Majors\n\n&gt; 1. Which courses are required for the CIS program at JMU, and how do they prepare you for your future career in technology?\n\nSomeone else linked the required courses list. I think they changed it though so that there\u2019s information systems option or business analytics option. \n\nhttps://www.jmu.edu/cob/cis/academics/index.shtml#concentrations\n\nThe analytics route would get you ready for data analyst type roles while info systems focuses on the capstone project/cloud computing/some other electives. But both share quite a few core courses. \n\nFor the most part though it\u2019s preparing you for federal tech consulting. Those places will put you all over the place in terms of tech. Business analyst, tech analyst, DBA, service now developer, Java dev, cloud engineer, you name it there\u2019s entry level work for it. \n\nTALK TO THE CONSULTING COMPANIES LIKE ACCENTURE, DELOITTE, ETC DURING CAREER FAIR AND DO ALL THEIR STUDENT PROJECTS THEY HIRE TONS OF JMU PEOPLE. \n\n&gt; 2. Can you describe the difficulty level of some of the required CIS courses at JMU?\n\nAssuming you get well reviewed professors most courses are like 5/10 in terms of difficulty. 7/10 if you get a bad prof. COB 291 is harder than most courses. Keep in mind you\u2019ll have a LOT of group projects late in the major.\n\nCIS 331 (Java) is the hardest and comes in late. Very strict overall and quiz/exam/homework minimums. Legit had tests where only 2/90 people walked out before time was up. Strongly recommend learning Java basics beforehand and doing some leetcode. 9/10 difficulty. \n\n484 if you go into systems concentration is a ton of work, pretty hard but not as brutal unless you\u2019re trying to win the competition. 8/10. \n\n&gt; 3. Are there any general education courses that you recommend taking to supplement the required CIS coursework, either to develop specific skills or to broaden your knowledge base?\n\nSome cool ISAT courses out there and decent number of people do CS double major or minor. CS has a lot more of the coding algorithms and in depth programming. \n\nFor gen eds I mostly did creative writing and English classes. See a completely different part of the college.\n\n&gt; 4. How do the required CIS courses at JMU prepare you for industry certifications or graduate studies?\n\nSkip grad school unless 2 years into your career you want an MBA. You\u2019re better off just working your career. If you grind leetcode and do self paced courses you can do software development. Masters in CS if a company pays for it could get you into development easier though. But overall skip grad school.\n\nFor certs you\u2019ll get some AWS experience but for solution architect you\u2019ll need to take an Udemy course to study. They\u2019re $15 or use LinkedIn learning for free via JMU email. Power bi probably has certs as well. Good resume padded but not crucial.\n\n&gt; 5. Can you tell me about any resources or support services available to students to help them succeed in the required CIS courses at JMU, such as tutoring or study groups?\n\nUse PASS sessions for the fucking hard classes like 291, 331 (I can\u2019t remember if 331 has them). LinkedIn learning for expanding your knowledge or supplementing lecture. \n\nLink up with your classmates especially in the hard classes. Find reliable smart ppl to work on harder homework\u2019s with and if you can choose them for group work. Join any group chats for the classes. DO NOT let people cheat off you though let them figure shit out if they\u2019re begging",

Hardest classes for me for the COB pre reqs \n\n3) get a minor in CS\n\n4) I took a cybersecurity class (CUS 425), the programming classes (Java and SQL) and the capstone class really prepared me for my career, the others did not prepare me at all.\n\n5) I recommend joining AIS to get connections, I didn\u2019t use any of the tutoring resources you might need to ask your professors.",

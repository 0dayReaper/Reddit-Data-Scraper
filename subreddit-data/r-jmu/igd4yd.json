Freshman have no clue what precautions the other 14 people in their group have been taking before coming on campus. I guess at least they have masks on, but a flimsy cloth mask won't really protect you after spending 8 hours in a group with a person who has coronavirus.",

A bunch of adults who have had many, many years to learn right from wrong, putting all responsibility on 18 year olds who are just now getting their first taste of what life not living with their parents is like. I was kinda on the \u201ccome on guys JMU is trying their best\u201d boat up until I received that ghastly email from Alger that was clearly a thinly veiled attempt at shifting the blame to us when classes inevitably move online. I\u2019m just glad I\u2019m a 5th year who decided to commute from home this year to save money instead of getting an apartment.",

While it\u2019s still good to call out other students for being dumb, it was just a hastily planned money grab from JMU and an outbreak was always going to happen, regardless of people partying.

    "postText": "So I\u2019m gonna be graduating JMU soon and have a few jobs that I\u2019m interested in/been in contact with. One of them is the Merck lab in Elkton. I currently utilize the buses in Harrisonburg to get around as I don\u2019t have my own car yet. So my question is, does anyone know if there are buses that service Elkton? I would move there to be closer to work ofc. But I wanted to know if it\u2019s possible to live in Elkton without a car",

But some businesses like Massanutten run their own shuttle service for employees in the area.  Merck ia pretty big, would imagine they have the resources for something like that, but not sure if they have one.",

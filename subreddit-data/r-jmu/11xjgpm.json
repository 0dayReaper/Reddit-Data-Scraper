I love the feel of the dorms and buildings at JMU but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s really big on partying and that\u2019s not something I\u2019m really interested in. I\u2019m into alternative/goth fashion and I\u2019m nervous that if I went to JMU I\u2019d feel out of place.. I have lots of concerns and stuff and I just want to know what you all think.",

The major is usually tight-knit and there are so many orgs and clubs that you will find like minded people in. Also, especially in the English and arts majors, there are plenty of people who are into the same aesthetics as you! Partying and Greek life are only as big as you want them to be. From my experience, no one is judgy or pushy, and it\u2019s easy to find like-minded people.",

There are most likely many accepting groups there, but I will say it may be easier to feel accepted with your goth/alt style here at JMU. Not trying to generalize at all! Just, in my experience, it may be a bit more open minded up here.",

I found the people in both groups to be pretty great and friendly, and you can absolutely have a great time without partying. When I visited tech I saw pretty much no advertising for student activities, but at jmu there's something almost every night! I do like how Jmu has dorms centrally located and not in a specific area like tech as well, so if you like the dorms I think that's reason enough to choose Jmu",

At either place there are plenty of other things to do though, student orgs are a great resource and there are so many at both schools. The party scene will be huge at basically any bigger school you look at in my experience. At JMU, goth and alternative fashion are both present but in smaller doses than Tech may have, but I can't be 100% on that. People are also incredibly nice on campus so I've never felt insecure in an outfit because of the style (I also like to dress alternatively). You definitely won't be the only person dressing like that, there is a great alternative/ music scene that I've met a lot of very cool people in. I think campus is beautiful and I like the environment a lot more than I did at Tech when I visited/ have gone down there to visit friends.  My best advice would be for you to stay here for a weekend if you have a friend that goes! Have them show you around :) \n\nBest of luck in your decision!",

For the SCOM general education requirement I did group presentation, worst mistake of my life\ud83d\ude2dtransferring (not just from JMU) is way more common than a lot of people think so if you\u2019re considering it, it\u2019s definitely worth looking into if you think you\u2019ll be happier elsewhere. IMO Harrisonburg was a bit of a shithole (especially being a girl walking downtown by myself) and Blacksburg is much a much nicer area, as I\u2019m sure you already know since you\u2019re from there too!!",

The house show scene here is alive and well (although it\u2019s the smallest it\u2019s ever been right now, it\u2019s growing again). Crayola house hosts a few bands and get togethers a week. It\u2019s super fun. There\u2019s tons of folks you would feel like you fit in with - punks and goths and general misfits - probably 200 or more in town. JMU\u2019s radio station WXJM is a great way to start meeting people - highly recommend joining that if you like music or want to have a talk show. Try tuning in online sometime, there\u2019s a lot of variety. \n\nI would definitely recommend JMU over VT for school as well. The campus is undeniably beautiful and the food is decent. VT\u2019s campus is not even close on this front. The liberal arts program at JMU is exceptionally strong, and I love all my professors. Only one or two I didn\u2019t care for but they were still helpful. The staff to student ratio is excellent. Dorms are solid, but avoid Jennings and eagle if you can. The village is rough but bearable. Move off campus into a house with some friends after a year or two. Stay far far FAR away from the student housing on the edges of town. It sucks. \n\nDowntown harrisonburg is a blast if you\u2019re into alt culture - you just have to know where to look. There\u2019s a lot of townie hate, don\u2019t listen to that. The townies are the coolest and a lot of them are JMU grads, scene legends, and creative entrepreneurs. It\u2019s a very supportive and kind community here - provided you avoid Greek life. \n\nFeel free to dm me if you have any specific questions!",

VT is a frat school but from what i've heard it's more like richmond university where you can walk in not being a frat. so VT might have jmu beat in partying at this point.\nedit: please walk down devin and send me pics of how many parties there are, I count foxhill and squire.  it isn't like it was.",

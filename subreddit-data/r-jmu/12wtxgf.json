            "comment": "I\u2019m a current 5th year Biology major, to be honest.. the issue isn\u2019t with the Biology department mostly but with the Chemistry and Physics line of classes. If you don\u2019t get an advisor that is present and likes to do their job, you will not hear from your advisor that will be a part of the Biology staff. You\u2019ll be lucky to get into any of your core Physics classes before your junior year and expect the Chemistry classes to take multiple attempts if not an attempt that ends in a C grade. I know many individuals who are pre professional that still struggle and end up completing a 5th year, as well as people who transfer in and complete an entire 5th year if not an extra semester. Before COVID the department was great and all of your cognates had staff dedicated to teaching you the material, but after COVID the Biology department lost a lot of staff and your cognate classes seem to be focused on the big picture of having a set amount of people pass instead of actually teaching you the material and often do not care to help you when you are struggling. Similarly, a lot of the staff are still used to you teaching yourself the material from an online source and will not stray from having you read a document or a textbook to gain the brunt of your information. Sadly at JMU in this department, you\u2019re lucky to get into a class with a solid professor that wants to teach you and help you any way they can and to have an advisor that will actually assist you. Sorry to be so negative about it but I\u2019m trying to be true after 5 recent years!",

The main thing professors in this set of classes tell you is for every hour you spend in class you should spend 4-5 hours out of class on the material, so keep that in mind! Especially for chemistry and physics they tell you the extended hours outside of class will help you. The classes that are difficult do have previous students of the class that hold sessions to help you normally 2 days a week and can be beneficial. I don\u2019t mean to sway you from JMU it\u2019s a great institution and I\u2019ve met some amazing friends, but their focus is definitely not on their science departments and the major takes a lot of outside time and work to get a decent grade in the classes! I think I\u2019ve just had a continuous series of bad professors that put me tragically behind since freshman year!",

You can still have a pre-professional added onto your degree and I think people find it a bit easier than the biology degree and they finish in 4 years! The only downside is you\u2019re required to take Health classes instead of choosing primarily biology classes!",

The classes required for the major are also the classes required for medical school. Go to the pre-professional office. They have dedicated advisors specifically for pre-professional students. They can tell you exactly which classes to take and can give you advice on when to take them, what order, what semester, etc. They are great because not only do they understand how to navigate the biology major at JMU, they know what medical schools are looking for in terms of classes.",

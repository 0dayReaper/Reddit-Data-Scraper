A lot of people here don\u2019t like the village because people on this sub seem to be much more introverted, but if that doesn\u2019t apply to you then you can just ignore all that. As someone who lived there I can tell you it wasn\u2019t my first choice initially but I ended up loving it.\n\nAs for your original question, I agree that I think the reason the shower situation ends up being fine is because everybody has different schedules so people are all starting and ending their days at different times.",

There are much nicer dorms to choose from that still have good social scenes. You pay the same no matter where you live so why not choose a place thats worth the money",

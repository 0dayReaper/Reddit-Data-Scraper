    "postText": "Hi, I'm a junior COB male who really wants to join a club this year as I don't think being in a fraternity would be for me. I'm planning on going to Student Org Night, but I'm not sure which booths to talk to.\n\nFor reference, I enjoy working out, listening to music and going out on the weekends. An outdoorsy club might be nice, and I want something a little more social too, on the likes of Boarderline (I've never skiied lol). But really I'd be open to anything!",

There's lot of *technically* non-club hangouts, too -- the current president enjoys thrifting on weekends and you might have the odd IHOP trip now and again. It's a great group, you'll be welcomed with open arms, and it's really easy to meet people and get to know them. I can't recommend that club enough.",

The classes at jmu prepare you very well for whatever comes next for you. Set me up nicely for professional school. Went in with a rock solid science background and could easily hold my own after getting a Jmu bio degree",

I have taken every anatomy and physiology class I could, as well as spending my first year as a health science major. I enjoy the classes and the teachers for Biology much more than health. If you have the drive to do it and study a decent amount outside of class, biology is the one for you. I finally graduate this May but I\u2019m glad I made it hard on myself.",

I plan on joining a few clubs and finding work quickly but my cousin told me this is basically what she did for her pre med track. I'd like to go to a few parties at least for first semester, guessing there's enough time for that.",

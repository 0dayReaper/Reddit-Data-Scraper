I'm always overwhelmed and worried about parking so I was wondering what to expect since I imagine Ballard will likely fill up? I have friends/family coming so I wanna be able to give them an idea of what to expect too.\n\nThanks and congrats other grads!",

            "comment": "I graduated in December, and I\u2019d recommend not parking in Ballard if you aren\u2019t able to get spots on the bottom. I got there close to when the graduates had to be there (so not early) and after commencement we were stuck in the upper levels for like 20 minutes or more just trying to leave and meet my family for lunch. So if you can\u2019t park on the bottom level, I\u2019d opt for parking a little further away by Rose/field hockey, or if you get there early enough the parking lots next to festival. Then you don\u2019t have to deal with the extra floors of a parking deck (and that will probably fill up first IMO)",

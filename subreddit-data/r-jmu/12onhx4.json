I\u2019m especially scared for intro programming and adv programming bc someone said they have high dropout rates.\n\nActually another question lol\nFor the math placement test if you score really high can you take a lower math class or do u have to go into the math class u tested into?",

Most orgs have parties and imo it\u2019s so much more fun to party with people you have common interests with rather than Greek life parties, and most club fees are not as expensive as sororities. Check out beinvolved\u2014they do a club fair every fall and spring semester. If you still want to get into Greek life parties, you have a very good chance of going to one if you identify as a woman and know others going to the same party.",

            "comment": "My job outside of school is In IT and I have transferred some credits from community college. I took an intro to python class that transferred as CS 149 and then an intro to Java class that transferred as a CS elective. If you want to get ahead I would suggest just downloading an IDE and try to start programming in python. There are plenty of books online that you can download for free and plenty of websites for programming exercises as well as videos on YouTube. \n\nPython isn\u2019t that bad you just got to practice. As for Java the programming concepts you\u2019ll learn from python will be the same but you will have to do more work because of javas syntax. In python you can just say \u201cx = 5\u201d but java it would be \u201cint x = 5; \u201c for a list in python you can basically append as many data types as you want and it can be a mix of data types, but arrays(lists) In java you can\u2019t do that you have to specify how much space you want in the array as well as what data type you will put in the array before putting things in it. There are other differences between them but essentially  they all languages boil down to core concepts.\n\nAs for IT you could start watching videos or reading books that are meant to prepare you for the A+ cert, net+ cert , and Sec+ cert. In IT you\u2019ll learn about stuff like configuring routers and switches. How to set up mail exchange servers, connecting to a domain, and installing windows. You\u2019ll learn how to convert from decimal to binary and hexadecimal and vice versa. You\u2019ll learn about subnetting and how to trouble shoot and ping across a network and a lot more.\n\nJust a disclaimer I am not a CS major nor IT major. I just happen to be math major that took a few CS classes and does some IT outside of school.",

I take AP comp sci right now but I don\u2019t really enjoy the class but that may be bc my teacher. It\u2019s also all Java and I think I prefer python. And funny enough I actually already have my A+ cert because I take a bunch of cyber classes right now! Idk maybe I\u2019m on a better track than I thought lol",

I am not an IT major so I don\u2019t fully know how the program works, but if you take a lower level math course you may fall behind. Some majors like engineering you need to either take math over summer or take a 5th year if you don\u2019t get into at least calc 1 as a freshman. Not saying this will happen for IT, but it\u2019s best to check before you put yourself in a lower math level",

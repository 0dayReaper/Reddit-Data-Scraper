    "postText": "Hey guys! I\u2019m a freshman kin major and am planning to apply to the ES concentration. For anyone who has done it before, do you need to complete the prerequisites before applying, or do you just need to be enrolled in them? I need Chem 131, bio 270, and bio 290 left, so I was thinking take 2 next semester then one the semester after. Would that be okay to apply by 2nd sem sophomore year? If not, I would have to take all 3 next semester, and that seems almost impossible. I\u2019m lowkey stressing out, lol. Thank you in advance :)",

You can take a class during the semester you are applying but it has to be done by the end of the semester (ex: app is due March 15, classes need to be done by May for admission the upcoming fall).\n\nYMMV but most people apply sophomore year after taking at least KIN 202/303\u2014you have plenty of time. Do not rush. I would also vehemently recommend against taking BIO 270/290 in the same semester.",

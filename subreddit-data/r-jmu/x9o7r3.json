The pork is complete shit every time I'm in. Pasta with some sauce? are you kidding? prisons probably give out better food &amp; for free &amp; with less of a wait. The pizza's usually burnt or just tastes like slop. They should just give out straight cheese and bread &amp; let us put it together. The boiled eggs... EVERY time I try the boiled eggs I get sick, I highly doubt they're changing them even once a day.\n\nGoing to Dhall is making me lose weight. If you're on a diet, DHall's perfect.",

They are tearing down one of the buildings in the village next year to begin what will eventually be a complete overhaul of the Village but they have to do it piece by piece as so many people live there they wouldn\u2019t have a place to house them if they did it all at once.",

I imagine covid held it up a bit though. \n\nAny clue as to which building is coming down first? I\u2019d love to stop by my old dorm one last time before it\u2019s gone.",

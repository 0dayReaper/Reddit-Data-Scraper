Will it just automatically appear once my dining dollars are all gone?",

I think JMU sent out an email earlier this semester saying how they would handle the non-transferable dining dollars in the spring, but I forget the specifics",

Im pretty sure that you automatically use your NTD when your normal ones run out, but you can always use the starship app to use NTD If you want to save your normal dining dollars. In the starship app, when you are at checkout, you just have to click on payment options and you can choose between normal and NTD.",

I have used them at majority of the locations like Chick Fil A and Starbucks without any issues. It does help that Starship lets you choose which place to take money out from too. I have been trying to use up my NTD bc of them getting rid of it so soon (which I think is BS btw)",

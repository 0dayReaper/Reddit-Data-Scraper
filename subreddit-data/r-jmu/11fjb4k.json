    "postText": "Has anyone taken this and know if there's a lab final in this lab? I know it can vary from instructor, just curious what everyone else's experience is with genetics lab? The syllabus doesn't talk about a final, but it's a very short, non-specific syllabus. Is it ok if I ask the instructor if we have a final? I'm curious because our entire class is not following what's being taught, all of us are so confused and overwhelmed with this lab. We are all kind of worried if there's a final we won't do well. Any advice before I ask the instructor if there is one? I'm not sure if that's an appropriate question towards them? (It's my first semester).",

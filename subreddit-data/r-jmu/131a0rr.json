Do ya'll think it would be more beneficial to major in finance and minor in computer science, or major in computer science and minor in something related to business? I know it's my decision but some insight on the programs/classes would be helpful. Thanks",

            "comment": "There's actually kind of three options for your situation. \n\nCIS is a business major that specializes in technology. It's first and foremost a business major, so you're going to complete the COB 300 classes. Some CIS majors choose to minor in CS to pick up more programming skills in electives.\n\nThe CS department has the regular CS major, and a new IT major. Neither of these have required business classes, so some students choose to minor in finance, business, or even CIS.\n\nAll three majors can lead to good jobs. CS is geared towards software engineering, CIS towards consulting and business analytics, and IT towards IT (obviously). That being said, you can go for any of those jobs with any of those degrees.\n\nIf you want to focus more on business, consider CIS. If you want to focus more on programming, choose CS. Use your minor to fill in the gaps.\n\nYou will have room to change your mind in your first year. I'm fairly certain that you're able to take the CS intro classes without declaring the major. You're not a \"full CS major\" until you apply for admission after getting a 3.0 in the intro sequence.",

Even in a recession the career fair landed me a 6 figure job out of graduation. That\u2019s the 99th percentile of income in the United States for adults under 25. I\u2019m not saying this to flex. This a testament to how amazing the cs department is at employing it\u2019s graduates.\n\nI\u2019m unsure why you think we learn nothing than making a shell? Maybe you just heard about what some other freshmen is learning and assume that the technical knowledge doesn\u2019t transfer? I\u2019ve built websites, discord bots that use ai speech to text api\u2019s to handle voice requests, and automated video editing bots for youtube using the knowledge I learned at jmu. In my 470 class we\u2019ve utilized nvidia gpu\u2019s to solve real math problems and render graphics. The skills we learn are so incredibly valuable. Just because the projects aren\u2019t directly \u201cmaking some finance app\u201d does not imply that we aren\u2019t capable of so much more. I even write python scripts to do my math homework. The fact that you think just making a UI and webapps is all there is to cs tells me you are extremely uniformed about how software is developed. \n\nThe way you phrased things sounds like you\u2019re insecure with your intelligence. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being in finance and it doesn\u2019t say anything about your intelligence, but claiming the cs department here is bad is just choosing to be ignorant.\n\nOP deserves a fair analysis of what jmu cs can provide and I think your comments were very disingenuous to the reality of cs.",

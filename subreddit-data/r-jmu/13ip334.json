    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI've just finished my freshman year at JMU, majoring in computer science and math. I'm considering transferring to Virginia Tech for computer science. I\u2019m still debating the pros and cons of each. I\u2019m interested in graduate school or going straight into the CS industry.\n\nFor JMU, I\u2019ve felt and read that we have a very undergrad focused \u201cteaching\u201d school, we have classes sizes of usually less than 30 and very helpful TA\u2019s and professors. However, I feel that JMU is less prestigious than VT.\n\nAs I see it, the pros for VT is that it is a polytechnic school as well as a research 1 institute, so it seems as if there are multiple pathways (no pun intended) to take out, in terms of industry partners and grad school. It also seems there is a larger alumni network and opportunities.\n\nCould anyone highlight the benefits of JMU and possible downsides as compared to Virginia Tech?\n\nAny help is appreciated.",

If you like Jmu then I would suggest you stay, if you are having a bad time here than maybe transferring will be better for you. The difference in prestige between Jmu and VT will not ultimately matter. This combination of majors is hard enough I would recommend not to stress you self out with switching schools unless you have a really good reason! \n\nI will say Jmu CS students will have a much closer relationship with professors than you will have at tech and hence you will have more research opportunities because there are no grad students.",

I didn\u2019t do CS but I did do a STEM degree. JMU gives you an excellent education. Going to JMU didn\u2019t hold me back in any way from attending now multiple quality grad schools. I have a few friends from JMU who did CS as well and they\u2019ve been very successful since graduating. If you like va tech more as a school and think you\u2019d be happier there then consider transferring. If you\u2019re considering transferring due to some perceived difference in prestige, don\u2019t bother",

                    "comment": "\"Better college experience\" is pretty subjective and honestly it depends on what kind of college experience you want. JMU is definitely big on partying (although Tech isn't too far behind on this one). It definitely isn't just VT students and alumni that think Tech is a better school. Tech has a much larger alumni network and FAR more resources for students. Virginia Tech is also consistently ranked much higher than JMU and is even in the Top 15 for specific majors (engineering, architecture, etc). Virginia Tech has a much larger endowment ($1.7b vs $200m for JMU) meaning more resources, more research, and better facilities for students and staff. Although JMU is beginning to lose its party school stereotype, it is still a relatively unknown school outside of Virginia whereas Virginia Tech is not. As someone who attended both schools, I would say VT is the better choice.",

Bottom line: I\u2019ve had the opportunity to hire many engineers and scientists in my lifetime (for private corps and public orgs) and I\u2019ve NEVER selected an individual based on the undergrad school they attended. Getting a degree in the STEM field will in most cases guarantee you a job regardless, however your point as to the network of the university is valid. I do have friends who graduated from VT, Penn State, UVA, JMU (among others) and they do sometimes have a preference to hire people who graduated from their respective university. That will always exist and there is no way to get around that\u2026for example Penn State has a much larger network than VT and odds are that an employer will more likely have a degree from Penn State than VT. Other than that, the education you get at any school will be the same\u2026calculus is calculus and the same things will be taught at VT as at JMU. You should make the decision on which school gives you the best opportunity to graduate (e.g. professors at JMU will be more accessible than ones at VT). After you graduate and start working, the college you attended as an undergraduate will be meaningless, you will be promoted based on how well you do your job and adults rarely (if ever) talk about which college they attended. Good luck and no matter what you decide, I have no doubt it will be the best decision for you.",

    "postText": "Not sure if anyone needs this. I'm an RA on campus and have seen this issue repeatedly since coming back, where the vending machines won't use dining dollars. Not sure why this semester it's suddenly a problem. The vending machines are trying to pull from the rollover dining of last semester, and for many people, it's too low, and they can't buy anything.\n\nIf you're having this issue, email card services about it and ask for help. They transferred my money over so I could use the vending machines again. Earlier in the month, someone said you could go buy something and ask them to use dining, so that's another possible fix.",

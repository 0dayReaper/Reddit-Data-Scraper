I have almost no computer science or programming knowledge but I still want to get an internship for the summer after my freshman year. What can I do to improve my chances of getting an internship?",

They're going to get a million people come up to them and say \"My name is xyz, I've been programming for x years, I've made xyz projects, and I'm a great candidate.\" Unless the candidates qualifications truly are excellent, it's hard to remember every face that comes through. \n\nSo make yourself memorable! Be lighthearted (but professional), make tangential conversation, get them talking about themselves for a little bit, and *come with questions prepared.*\n\nIt takes a lot more work, but if you're really dedicated a trick that has worked for me 100% of the time is, before the career fair, look at the list of every company coming and write down *every single one you're even remotely interested in*. From there, do a little research on the company and write down bullet points to bring up in your conversation. Don't memorize them, and only bring it up if it naturally flows, but it really does make a difference.\n\nI got my current job at the JMU CISE fair, and I largely believe a significant part of that is because I did what I mentioned above. I found the company's website and noticed they used one catchphrase (not their motto) over and over and over again. So, in my conversation with the recruiter, I brought up that I was doing research on their company (always mention this, it shows interest), and saw that they emphasize \\[their motto here\\]. I then went on to talk about how I really related to that and ways in which I had incorporated such a process into my own work. After that the recruiter gave me some simple questions, invited me to an interview the next day and hired me on the spot.\n\nThe CISE fair is an incredible resource and, while it's certainly not easy getting an internship as a freshman, it definitely doable - and that's where it'll happen.\n\nIf you follow these tips, and project external - and internal - confidence, I'm certain you may be able to work something out.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have any questions! Best of luck!",

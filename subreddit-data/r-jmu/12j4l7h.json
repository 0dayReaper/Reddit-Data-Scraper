    "postText": "Hey guys I have heard the village is relatively easy to end up in because of the amount of freshman it holds. Just for future planning and to relieve any anxiety, I was wondering if since I put down my enrollment deposig on April 8th, will I have a good shot at being able to get one of the village houses? Would be even better if I had the freedom to chose which of the buildings I wanted. I think I was pretty early-ish to complete the housing contract and deposit but I honestly have no idea. \n\nWould love to hear the amount of options that people in previous years have had that also put down their deposit around April 8th. Thanks everyone :)",

My roommate put her deposit down the day before it was due so\u2026 housing times might be influenced by roommates as well. Technically they should go by when you put down your deposit, not your roommates, but maybe I got screwed over :/",

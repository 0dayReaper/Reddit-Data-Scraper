    "postText": "I have one summer class that\u2019s $1.5k and planning to pay out of pocket. I have most of the money rn but my account is also asking about an \u201cAdmission Deposit\u201d that\u2019s roughly $400. Is this $400 going into my summer tuition or is this a seperate bill making this class almost $2k? (\ud83d\ude10)\n\nsorry if this is a dumb question, just transferred here and a little confused, anything helps \u2764\ufe0f",

I remember someone in son\u2019s orientation group (and I think we did the last event) had just gotten off waitlist. Also saw another Facebook mom post that her son got off of waitlist 2 weeks before the semester started - was all set for tech, then heard he got into jmu, his dream school.",

Virginia Tech notified all its waitlisted students last week that they had a higher yield than expected and will be making NO waitlist pulls whatsoever this year after taking 2-3 thousand off the waitlist the last few years. I know a bunch of kids waitlisted for VT that would\u2019ve backed out of their JMU commitment (like my son) if they had gotten into VT, but now that VT has said no waitlist pulls they are sticking with JMU. So it\u2019s definitely affecting JMU\u2019s waitlist now too.",

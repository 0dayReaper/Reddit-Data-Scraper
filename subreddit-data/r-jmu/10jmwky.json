I had maybe 32 credits dual enrolled from HS plus maybe another 15 from the fall semester at CC so I guess around 47 total? Many of the dual enrollment classes didn\u2019t end up going towards my major though cause they weren\u2019t related \ud83e\udd72 that was the only downfall of not having my associates when I transferred but it played out really well in the end",

I don\u2019t know how it is now but I imagine if you\u2019re relatively close to a 3.0 you should be good, and if you\u2019re transferring from a Virginia CC if you have above a 3.0 it\u2019s guaranteed!",

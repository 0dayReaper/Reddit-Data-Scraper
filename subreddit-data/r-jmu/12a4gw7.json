    "postText": "Hey there, I\u2019m an incoming student for Fall 2023, and after attending choices I\u2019m really interested in a double major, particularly CS &amp; IT. Anyone here have any experience with a double major (not CS/IT necessarily)? What\u2019s it like?\n\nIf it counts for anything I\u2019ve got no intention to rush, and I\u2019m not a huge party guy. Still would like to be a little social though.",

In that case you would not have to take extra classes if you plan to graduate in 4 years. If you were to take CIS as a second major though (which receives a BBA), then you\u2019d have to take 150 credit hours to graduate with 2 degrees.",

                    "comment": "Just wanted to jump in and say that you can do CS as a second major to CIS without it counting as a second degree, which keeps your total credit hours at 120. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo OP's question: IT is a new major so we haven't had anyone double major in IT and CS yet. I think it makes more sense to choose one or the other and then do a minor that gets you experience in a different discipline. We are a liberal arts university, and it makes sense to expand beyond the tech field. \n\nThe intro sequence for both majors is the same (149 then 159 and 227), so you can decide (likely) at the end of your freshman year which major fits you best.",

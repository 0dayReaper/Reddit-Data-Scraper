People also find roommates on Facebook somewhere and on Instagram (there\u2019s probably an account titled JMU class of 2027 or something which posts people\u2019s profiles). Idk anything about Madison International, so I can\u2019t tell you how finding a roommate will be different with that",

But there are RLC members that have non member roommates too so not a big deal. Roommates usually meet eachother in the website jmu uses to match u with potential roommates (ppl call it roommate tinder) i think its called StarRez. I know people who met eachother thru patio too (idk if yall use it)",

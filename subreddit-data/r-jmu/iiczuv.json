Without JMU we wouldn't have many of the businesses we have here, there would be no transit system to speak of, and a good chunk of the city budget would be missing (because even though JMU doesn't have to pay property taxes to the city, a check is made out to the city every year fro the amount that it would be). The city itself would be hurting, bad, were it not for JMU, there is no way around that. I'm a local that grew up here, I'm heavily involved in the community (including city government), and someone that works for the university. I can say this with absolute certainty that Harrisonburg would not be near the city it is without JMU. Those employers we have here wouldn't be here were it not for them.",

I don't see it as focused on serving folks in poverty. Also, the student housing is great, but we have almost no affordable housing for low income families available in town, save the Housing Authority housing. JMU Is great in what it does for the town, it is terrible for what it does to lower income households in term of rent and housing availability.\n\n I remember well when we sold our town to JMU chunk by chunk, including the High School (and the 2nd and 3rd highschool fiasco), the Co-op, etc. In that respect, JMU has been a glorious profit opportunity for the town.\n\nBut, we also have industry, and support Rockingham County families as a shopping base. I was replying to the implication that without JMU, Harrisonburg would fold. Certainly the landscape would change, but the businesses that would be hurt would be those businesses that are built for students. \n\nI have respect for JMU, I acknowledge on a whole, it is great for business. \n\nPS, I circle the same water as you, my friend.

The main benefit of JMU is to the businesses and those who own the property around this area rather than the community at large. A corn field being turned into student housing is a great idea from a business perspective, but if it doesn't aid those in need of affordable housing in the area but only further drives up property values it in fact makes it that much harder on those in the community.\n\nLand development and flourishing businesses do not equate to the people in most need having their needs met and even works against them by inflating property values to unaffordable rates.",

It doesn't affect the.application process because (1) whether an organization is \"political\" here is a statement of opinion, and (2) it's not a fact that SGA can use to deny this sort of application, since they are legally bound to be content and viewpoint neutral.\n\n\n&gt;Also, why is every person who brings up the first amendment in conversations like this only capable of viewing it in the most myopic, simplistic way possible? \n\nI'm not sure what you mean by this.\n\nThe myopic, simplistic, view here is that JMU or any other branch of the government should end free speech and block speech that you dislike. That is a myopic view because it fails to account for the fact that you don't get to be the one deciding what speech is allowed or not.\n\nThe nuanced view is that freedom of speech sometimes allows shitty speech to take place, but that is the cost of keeping government from suppressing any speech outside the norm, and that right protects marginalized groups more than anyone else.\n\n\n&gt;Are you not capable of understanding that \"\"opinions\"\" about a marginalized group that amount to \"you shouldn't exist\" are hateful inherently? \n\nHateful speech is free speech. There is no First Amendment exception for hate speech.\n\n&gt;And that these statements can be taken as incitements? \n\nSo what? Incitement is free speech, until it amounts to an \"incitement to imminent lawless action where such action is likely,\" and none of the speech here comes anywhere close to that. The incitement limit also doesn't allow for prior restraint of speech, so it's not worth discussing here.\n\n&gt;Y'all really think that the only harmful speech possible = \"I am going to physically harm you right now.\" \n\nNo,.of course not. But incitement, to be unprotected speech under the First Amendment, does need to be of **imminent** lawless action, so it does in fact need to be something that could happen right now (at the time the words are spoken) or it's free speech.\n\n&gt;Goofy.\n\nUh huh. Read my response. Still think I'm goofy? You shouldn't, since it's abundantly clear I'm considerably more knowledgeable on this topic.",

I did some more research on the topic and agree that hate speech is indeed protected under the first amendment. My view of what constitutes hate speech isn't so much \"I dislike this therefore it's hate speech\" as implied but rather \"this violates the implicit social contract of mutual tolerance by being INTOLERANT of a certain race, sexuality, ethnicity, etc.\" The former of these two assumes a level playing field wherein hate speech isn't disproportionately leveraged against marginalized groups.\n\n I have no doubt that a more absolutist interpretation of freedom of speech protects the marginalized as well. However, leftist protestors are much more likely to have their first amendment rights violated than conservative protestors. See BLM and environmental protests and the number of arrests. Also, everything going on with sweeping drag bans and \"Don't say Gay\" bills. It seems that there is reliably freedom for those on the right to express hateful ideologies, but not for leftists to assemble or for queer people to be afforded freedom of expression. Whenever I see someone mention first amendment rights in response to conservative issues, they are not typically considering how constitutional rights mix/don't mix with a systemically racist, hetero-patriarchal society and are instead looking for a cheap gotcha. This is also why I called this view simplistic.\n\nWrt incitement, I wasn't aware that it had to be imminent until doing more research. I don't disagree that this drastically narrows the scope of what isn't protected and isn't really applicable to this one specific situation. I believe that the culture war Liz is ultimately helping to perpetuate amounts to stochastic terrorism against trans people and that we are already seeing the consequences of this. As a trans person, it's scary. And that's the point, I guess, for people like myself to be too scared to exist in public. I think that JMU and other universities need to do a better job considering how allowing things like this on campus clashes with any supposed care they have for trans students.\n\nAnd finally, free speech aside, I'd argue that allowing hate speech on campus contributes to a hostile environment for all transgender students. YAF seemed to have known this on some level, or they wouldn't have been cagey when discussing their speaker.",

Sometimes I reply in college subreddits without remembering most of the posters are like my son or my students (I teach Constitutional law at a local college on the side of my law practice) and simply haven't received a thorough First Amendment education.\n\n&gt;The former of these two assumes a level playing field wherein hate speech isn't disproportionately leveraged against marginalized groups.\n\nIt very well might be, these days. In terms of how most people would define the topic.\n\nThe problem is, once we make laws about it, that definition is out of our hands.\n\nThink about the cops. Not the utopia cops. The real cops we have now. Do you trust them to arrest the \"right\" people under hate speech laws? I sure as hell don't. \n\nOr college administration.\n\n&gt;However, leftist protestors are much more likely to have their first amendment rights violated than conservative protestors. See BLM and environmental protests and the number of arrests. Also, everything going on with sweeping drag bans and \"Don't say Gay\" bills. \n\nAgain - this very well might be the case. But it's also an extremely good case to **broaden**, not lessen, the scope of the First Amendment. We don't want to give the people who are violating, or attempting to violate, the First Amendment, any more tools.\n\n&gt;they are not typically considering how constitutional rights mix/don't mix with a systemically racist, hetero-patriarchal society\n\nI consider it quite a bit, and not to sound like a broken record, but for me that justifies strengthening our rights as much as possible. \n\nIf you believe that government is systematically racist and patriarchal, then you should also recognize that whatever restrictions you allow government to place on speech will be administered in the same way.\n\n&gt;I believe that the culture war Liz is ultimately helping to perpetuate amounts to stochastic terrorism against trans people and that we are already seeing the consequences of this. As a trans person, it's scary. And that's the point, I guess, for people like myself to be too scared to exist in public.\n\nIt probably does. And I'm sorry it's scary. I'm saying putting more power in the hands of the likes of Glenn Youngkin to control what gets displayed or said in public is unlikely to assuage your fears.\n\n&gt;I think that JMU and other universities need to do a better job considering how allowing things like this on campus clashes with any supposed care they have for trans students.\n\nI'm sure they consider it a lot, and I'm sure there is a ton of hand-wringing behind the scenes about it. But the First Amendment forbids them from blocking such events. They have to be content-neutral in the way they deal with student clubs. And that is a good thing - at the time the school got an LGBTQ club and that sort of activism started to take place, it's pretty certain the people running the school would have banned it, had they the power to do so.\n\nA thought on all of that: Speech is **powerful**. Ideas are **powerful**. Living your best life is **powerful**. Look at the Cold War (I'm old enough to remember). We didn't beat the Soviets with tanks or missiles or guns. We beat the scariest empire ever, collapsed an entire system ruling over hundreds of millions of people, and ended a half-century-long standoff with fucking **MTV.** More than anything else, it was our ideas and our culture and our media that caused the Soviet system to collapse on itself.\n\nAll you can do here is go out and live your life and speak out about the wrongs that you see.",

    "postText": "I know this post is a long shot, but I'm wondering if any grad students or staff at JMU might be willing to help me get some guest passes to use the rock climbing gym at JMU? I am a 34F veterinarian and I am staying in Harrisonburg for the next 2 weeks for work. I have just gotten back into climbing after a multi year hiatus and am finally seeing really great progress (I climbed my first ever 5.10 last week!!). There are no climbing gyms in Harrisonburg besides the JMU gym, hence why I am reaching out to you all. I am afraid if I don't climb for 2 weeks that I will lose a bit of my progress. I will obviously pay for the guest passes and I could even buy you some food or groceries as a token of appreciation!! I apologize if this post is off-topic or against the sub reddit rules. Thank you!",

I feel responsible for self-teaching to a degree I have never felt before, which doesn\u2019t even make sense since many professors have added online videos and resources like that to their classes.  Professors are trying but things just feel different, in my opinion.  \n\nChanging up what rooms are open, closed, available for studying, not available for studying without signing up, where students can eat, where they can\u2019t, etc. is making things feel unnecessarily hectic.  My classes have changed rooms 3 times already, and then will change to fully online eventually.    \n\nTLDR; It\u2019s just hectic and it doesn\u2019t feel like the administration cares beyond making good PR statements and Facebook posts.",

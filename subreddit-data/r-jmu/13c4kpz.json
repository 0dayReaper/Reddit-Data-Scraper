    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019m an incoming doctoral student (DMA, so in the school of music) at JMU looking for somewhere to live next year. My budget is around $700/month and I would like a one-bedroom apartment if at all possible\u2014or at the very least to live with other graduate students. Is anyone leaving and needs someone to take over a lease, or otherwise aware of a decently convenient place to live subject to those constraints?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also have a small cat (&lt;10-lbs) and will be occupied out-of-state until August, but I am happy to sign a lease starting before then if necessary. Please DM me if you are aware of any housing opportunities.",

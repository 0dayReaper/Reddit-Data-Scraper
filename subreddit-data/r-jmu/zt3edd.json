I'm living at the altitude this semester and wanted to know if anyone knows if the gates to walk into the cottages on Port Republic Road are open, so that I can go to the bus stop, or if I need to buzz in or have a key, etc. my gut is telling me they will be, given that it's the school year, but I'd rather be safe than sorry",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m a current freshman at VCU and am hoping to transfer to JMU for fall of next year. I was admitted to jmu last year for graphic design, but switched to pre-nursing last second and decided to go to vcu as it was the cheapest while i was figuring out what i wanted to major in. I\u2019m between applying to jmu for communication disorders (to eventually do speech pathology) or apply into nursing. I know i\u2019d have to spend a semester at jmu before i can apply into the nursing school, and am not sure if that will set me back from graduating on time. I had a fine hs gpa, and I have 15 credits already from taking classes over the summer at nvcc and also de courses from my senior year. I\u2019m just not sure what to apply for, and how hard the programs are. I also am not sure if jmu allows u to do secondary majors, we have that at vcu in case you\u2019re not admitted into the nursing school you can continue your secondary major and graduate on time. Does anyone have recommendations? thanks!",

            "comment": "Since you'll be a sophomore, as long as you've done some prereqs you should still graduate on time -- generally people don't apply to the program until spring of their sophomore year for entry in the fall of their junior year. \n\nAs for your question about secondary majors, as far as I know that isn't an option at JMU. I wasn't a nursing major, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but if you're worried about getting into the program, I recommend checking the catalog to find a backup major and seeing if JMU offers a minor for the same program. If so, awesome -- you can take those specialized classes and be ahead of the curve should nursing not work out. If not, see if you can find a minor that requires a lot of the same classes for your backup major. \n\nDo be aware that depending on your backup major, you still may not be able to graduate on time. You'll be able to catch up with some majors eally quickly, and there are others you won't be able to do that with.  Either way, I recommend reaching out to someone at JMU, whether that's the potential minor advisor or the chair of your prospective secondary department, if the sequence of classes isn't spelled out in the catalog. (The catalog will note if a class requires a prereq. It won't note whether a class is given once every three or four semesters. Ask. It will save you headaches.) \n\nThis was a bit longer than I meant for it to be, so if I was confusing please don't hesitate to DM me. Good luck!",

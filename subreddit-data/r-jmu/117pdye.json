    "postText": "Today in class, as the title says - a student was using their phone in class when the professor was giving a lecture. A lot of students tend to typically check their phone once or twice throughout the class but this unfortunate student got caught. The professor blew up and started cursing at the student for being disrespectful, asking him how the hell was he raised and saying the f word repetitively. Yes, it was unprofessional for the student for being on their phone, but it really rubs me the wrong way that the professor couldn\u2019t address more maturely and not throw a mini tantrum over it. I just want to hear the community\u2019s thoughts over this.",

Be it telling the student to leave the room or deducting points or what have you. That\u2019s how you deal with it professionally. You don\u2019t just lash out at people because the student was doing something that the syllabus says is prohibited.",

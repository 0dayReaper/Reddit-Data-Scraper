            "comment": "Oh lord here we go again. So: it really depends on what you want to prioritize. Do you want somewhere that is central to the university? The Village/Hillside area. Do you want a new building? Skyline. Do you want more a private bathroom? Bluestone. Each building has their own perks and downsides too. The Village may be central, but doesn\u2019t have AC in the rooms and\u2026 respectfully the buildings are a little worn down to put it nicely. The Bluestone area has those nice more private bathrooms, but it may not being the closest to everything depending on your class schedule and also doesn\u2019t have the *easiest* way to make friends (not that it\u2019s too difficult at JMU). Skyline has nice quality rooms and feel very clean, but are very distant from campus excluding the science buildings and e-hall. \n\nI lived in Bell (Hillside Area) my first year and while it wasn\u2019t what I wanted at the time, I still had a great experience and was able to make friends that have lasted me all the way through JMU. \n\nAs an RA I have lived in Gifford (Bluestone) and Shenandoah (Skyline) and as a Hall Director I live in Harper Allen-Lee. If you have questions or details that you want, you can definitely refer to the Residence Life website or you can message me if you want! \n\nHope this helps and welcome to JMU :)",

Village overall is a great place to live, while it can be hot for the first month or two, if you have good suitemates most of the time you just keep dorm doors open. Also our dorms just got some nice new AC units. The big plus side to the village is the party scene. Everyone in the village is pretty much rushing frats or sororities so you will always have a place to party. However something interesting to note is Hillside is great as well. Hillside has a great party scene and nicer dorms. All in all I suggest village or hillside",

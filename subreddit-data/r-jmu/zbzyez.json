    "postText": "So I graduate on Dec 17 and expect to have a large group (10ish) to go get food with. Family is very traditional Middle Eastern and wants to go to a restaurant with food they\u2019re familiar with/practices halal. Any recommendations? Does not have to be in Harrisonburg. I have roommates that I don\u2019t know very well who are not graduating so I will not be hosting any sort of party at my apt so ideally a restaurant is best",

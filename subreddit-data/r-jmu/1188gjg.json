JMU is interested in utilizing the Algerdome like JPJ and having it as an easy checkpoint going from the South into New England right along 81. They are also looking into groups outside of alumni as well that are larger artists.",

Typically spring was in Wilson and fall was in Convo (the building that was replaced by the AUBC/Algerdome)\n\nI have no idea how the pandemic affected them other than they look to have rebranded (they got rid of the sun logo) and also look to have stopped operating Grafton (the campus movie theater by Madison Union).",

They nolonger operate Grafton on a regular schedule with different movies every week.\n\nI do remember when I was a student they switched from hosting 2 movies a week to hosting 1 movie a week. Now it looks like they do no weekly movies but still sometimes have special showings.\n\nThe UPB website has changed. Based on wayback machine it looks like they merged the concert committee (Center Stage) and the bands committee (Spotlight Sounds) and got rid of the film committee.",

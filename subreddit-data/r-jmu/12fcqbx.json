    "postText": "Did anyone here transfer from HCC or around the Hagerstown, MD area? How do you get back and forth from school? I\u2019m trying to find the best way to get to campus once I transfer, but I also want to visit before then, so I\u2019m interested in a round-trip that isn\u2019t uber expensive.\n\nMoney isn\u2019t a big deal after that since I won\u2019t be going back and forth super often, but is it really complicated? I definitely haven\u2019t found a straightforward route so far, but the recruiter said JMU gets lots of HCC transfers so I figure somebody must know, lol.\n\nty in advance :3",

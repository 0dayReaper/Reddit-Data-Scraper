    "postText": "So I already deposited for JMU, thinking I would not hear back from anywhere else. But then a week or two after, I got accepted off of the waitlist at one of my other schools, and I decided to go to that school, after receiving their aid letter a week later. I put in my incoming freshman cancellation notice (I don't want to take up someone else's spot) around May 13. I believe I am supposed to have received a confirmation email 5 days later and lost access to MyMadison.  But I haven't gotten any email from them regarding that. I actually just got a reminder to sign up for my JMU orientation and I can still access MyMadison. I am unsure if my cancellation form was processed, and now I'm not sure what to do about this.",

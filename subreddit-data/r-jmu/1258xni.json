I'm going to transfer from nova vccs in the fall and my gpa is currently a 3.0.\n\nunfortunately, I won't have an approved associate degree since it has general studies in it but I mostly have a's and b's. lastly, I am retaking a class over the summer, since I didn't pass but overall, my grades are good.\n\nWhat do y'all think??",

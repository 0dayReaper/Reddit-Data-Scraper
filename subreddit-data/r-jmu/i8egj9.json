                                    "comment": "&gt; Once you graduate, drop below half-time enrollment, or leave school, your federal student loan goes into repayment. However, if you have a Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, or Federal Family Education Loan, you have a six-month grace period before you are required to start making regular payments. You\u2019ll have a nine-month grace period if you\u2019ve got a Perkins Loan. (Got a PLUS loan? You\u2019ll go into repayment as soon as the loan is fully disbursed\u2014which means once it\u2019s paid out. But if you\u2019re a graduate and professional student PLUS borrower, you will be placed on an automatic deferment while in school and for six months after graduating, leaving school, or dropping below half-time enrollment.)\n\nPer https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment\n\nAdditionallyany DoE lstudent loans are not accruing interest and no payments are required until December 31, 2020 per Section 2 of https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-continued-student-loan-payment-relief-covid-19-pandemic/\n\nAdditionally there are deferment and forbearance options that students taking a gap year would likely qualify for in the worst case.",

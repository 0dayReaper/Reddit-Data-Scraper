    "postText": "I am a cs major who is currently 2nd semester of freshman year. I have taken/taking CS 149, CS 159, CS 227, and the rest are gen-eds.  I very much want to study abroad but am unsure the best way to go about it. Some questions I have are: Would an exchange program or study abroad be best for my major? Would a summer program be better for graduating on time/ having a more relaxed fulfilling experience? I've heard so many amazing quotes from friends who have immersed themselves in another culture for a few months such as \"It was the best experience of my life\" and \"You won't regret it\". I do not doubt this at all and I do think a semester abroad will be an experience I will remember for the rest of my life; I just want to make the best of it by planning ahead.   \nAny advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated.",

Now I dont have much knowledge about study abroad/exchange programs however Id reckon some sort of over the summer study abroad program would be best. You don\u2019t miss anything during the school year and your not taking a full schedule\u2019s worth while doing it.",

If that\u2019s the case I may just spend the money traveling on my own for a better cheaper experience",

I have regretted it ever since. The classes taken in Florence are certainly a \"waste of time\" to a computer science major (mostly centering on Italian language, food, and culture), but it could be argued that my math minor ended up being a waste of time as well. I recommend at least applying.",

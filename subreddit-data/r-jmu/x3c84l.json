In D-Hall there are lines for dessert, and sometimes pizza- that was never a thing last year and I have no idea why there is now. Anyone know why this is? Are there just way more freshmen this year than before?",

It\u2019s incredibly crowded, the city was not built with this in mind. The roads need a major overhaul to accommodate all of these people without causing a strain to everyone who lives here. But i know that would cost so much money and would interrupt so much travel. I\u2019m not sure why JMU keeps adding more and more people each year.",

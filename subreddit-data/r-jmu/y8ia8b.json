    "postText": "Current VCCS sophomore weighing my options and JMU is a top contender for transfer this Fall, just just curious for existing students how much do you find yourself spending in a year in total? According to the JMU website they estimate a total of about 30K for all costs including tuition, housing, etc. Do you find yourself spending that much? More? Less?\n\nI don't expect to get any aid whatsoever, and I am pursuing a CS degree if that's relevant at all.",

            "comment": "I graduated 3 years ago but I found the costs to be pretty much what I was expecting.\n\nIf possible, I\u2019d recommend working while in school. I worked 40-50 hours weekly during the school year and 50-60 during breaks/summer. It allowed me to graduate pretty much debt free despite not having aid or assistance and I never had to take out loans. Just find cheap housing and cook your own meals and JMU can be relatively affordable if you\u2019re transferring.\n\nEdit: also bike to school. A used bike can cost less than a single parking pass",

They tack on so much money and grocery shop mindfully and pack a lunch. Tuition is non negotiable obviously but with everything else as long as you are mindful it is doable.",

I commute from my house 30 minutes everyday because I\u2019m pretty local to Harrisonburg and not counting gas I think my tuition is roughly $8k a semester with a 5 punch meal plan. That doesn\u2019t count what I spend on gas but it\u2019s usually not more than $2k a full year I think. I don\u2019t pay for housing though. The best option for textbooks if you can find them is Facebook on a jmu student page. I\u2019ve saved loads that way.",

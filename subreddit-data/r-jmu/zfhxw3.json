    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m in my junior year of high school, and am interested in JMU. I have a 3.5 gpa and I am in state. I haven\u2019t taken the sat yet but I am involved in lots of sports and out of school activities. My school doesn\u2019t offer lots of AP\u2019s but offers a few dual enrollment classes and was wondering if I would likely get into JMU. Thanks in advance!",

JMU is really looking for all around individuals so regardless of academics like AP/DE, you\u2019re balanced with a already high gpa and other extracurriculars.\n\nAnd if you write a great personal essay then basically you\u2019re guaranteed admission. Good luck, don\u2019t stress it.",

Also, idk what major you plan to take but if your school offers dual enrollment government, biology, or psychology I HIGHLY recommend you take them bc they\u2019ll cover some of your gen Ed classes! JMU is also very test optional, myself and many of my friends got in without taking the SAT/ACT.",

I'm going to assume somewhat nova area. Look elsewhere, unless you want an exact repeat of nova high school just a little different and more \"grown up\" go to jmu.  I originally took a gap year which was the best decision i've made, and while its made being back in school for 1.5 years really hard, the greatest thing i learned from it is get the fuck out of state.  there is so much more to offer and learn and experience and completely different people to meet (liberal arts college in va, even people from all around the state who attend here fall into a couple of narrow demographics that are pretty much the same(not making a political statement just a demographics one)).  all in all just look/think better, at the end of the day jmu is a VERY mediocre school that really does not have a whole lot to offer besides being a meat grinder for cash disguised behind the smoke and mirrors that the university has been using in an attempt to rebrand themselves.",

Just for an example, in my case first semester of senior year with a 1330 on sat and a 3.7 gpa Alabama was going to give me 20k a year just based off of those stats no fasfa requirements or academic besides maintaining a certain gpa while there.  for a slew of reasons i switched in june of my between year before i decided to take a gap.  If you want to stay instate look into applying to like tech declaring an agriculture major or another one of their least popular majors and switch after first semester/ year because you'll only take gen eds at that time and you chance of acceptation on one of those majors is much higher.  But do your research on what schools around the country throw around cash like Alabama, because there are plenty  that fit lots of different \"wants\" from prospective students",

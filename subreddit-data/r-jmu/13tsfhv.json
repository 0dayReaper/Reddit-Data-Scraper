    "postText": "Hi! I was wondering if anyone knows if there is a Kpop club. Or something along the lines. I\u2019m not Korean, but would love to get more involved at JMU. \n\nI found an Instagram for KSA (Korean student alliance), but it hasn\u2019t been active since 2019. \n\nPlease let me know!",

JMU is primarily white, and so clubs like cultural and racial student unions are really for people of that minority to come together and have a space of their own.",

It's sort of racist, but that's just how it is.\n\nMost of the clubs here either never meet or are exclusive. Try the outdoors club if anything.",

    "postText": "Hello, JMU Reddit! I am a Media Arts and Design Major who is working on a User Research Project for SMAD 203. My topic is how we can improve the art programs at JMU, and I was hoping to receive some feedback here on how to do that. You do not need to be involved in the School of Arts, Design, and Art History or club to participate in this survey. Any feedback to help make art at JMU more accessible to students helps. Thanks for participating! (P.S. The project is due by February 20, 2023, 11:59 PM).\n\nThe link:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIWQoNzAiJgPvcXgKWTYTTOhPhKSyR-\\_ZX6fzh83XcwaIFVQ/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIWQoNzAiJgPvcXgKWTYTTOhPhKSyR-_ZX6fzh83XcwaIFVQ/viewform)",

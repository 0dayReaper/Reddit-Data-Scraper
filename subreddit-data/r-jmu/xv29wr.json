It looks to be a RFID tag.   \n\n\nIf it is removable without being damaged (As in if it is a cling and not a sticker) I would say to try to move it to the top of your windshield. If that does not work try holding it out your window in the same plane as the windshield.\n\nThe ideal place to stick it on your windshield is as high as possible on the same side as the reader. The reader will look like a giant flat plate on the door or gate.\n\nIt is possible the coatings or tinting on your windshield might be interfering with the signal between the pass and the reader.",

They just know that most students won't bother to do research and find the correct procedure to get between $4000-$6000 back, depending on certain factors. What you need to do is this. Outside the University Business Office (office will be closed because campus is closed due to Covid19) is a little station with different documents. On the floor, draw a pentagram and surround it with lit candles. Make some sort of blood sacrifice and BE SURE that a couple drops hit the pentagram. By now, it should be glowing red and you'll be in the presence of Satan. Sell your soul in a deal that will net you back roughly half a semester's worth of tuition. This only takes like 20 minutes!",

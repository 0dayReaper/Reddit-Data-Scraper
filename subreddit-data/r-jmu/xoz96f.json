    "postText": "I\u2019m a sophomore applying for the spring semester as a computer science major and there are a few math credits I\u2019m missing. I know some schools still accept some people with missing credits and just make them take the credits before they continue with the course, I\u2019m wondering if JMU is similar",

It will be better to take CS 227 Discrete Structures with the CS faculty, and it's built in to the core of the major curriculum. \n\nIf you're missing College Algebra, then you won't be able to take the intro sequence, and you'll definitely want to talk to the advisor to plan out your course sequence.\n\nYou'll be able to finish the major in your remaining 5 semester.",

It wasn't until a week before graduation that it came to my attention that most of courses were treated as \"electives\" and not as English, Science, etc. courses. I had a fun week before graduation speaking with department heads getting classes I had taken 4 years and two school ago reclassified. Don't do what I did.",

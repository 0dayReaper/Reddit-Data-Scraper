In fact most of you kids on here have done nothing but belittle the man to the point where the jokes are taking on a life of their own and no longer have any context.\n\nMaybe he deserves all of this, maybe not, but I have never gotten the feeling that he was revered.",

It's pretty much what I'd expect from young people coming to terms with functioning in a society and encountering a figurehead who lacks any direct mandate from the students themselves to lead them(ignoring any supposed mandate from the state that the students almost certainly did not elect or choose), but attempts to lead all the same.\n\ntl;dr: students didn't make him president, resent his authority, reduce that to ashes with maymays on the internet because that's the only place they're still free.",

One thing to keep in mind is that, if you are currently enrolled in a class whose time conflicts with the waitlisted course, MyMadison will just skip over you to the next student. Also, profs can see what number students are on the waitlist, so you can try emailing to see where you are on the list.",

In your experience, if a required course has several sections and each one of them is full, along with each wait list by the end of the 2nd day (over 25+ seats, with original seat capacity of 30), is that a good sign that the class will eventually open up to larger seating capacity or additional sections will be added? I'm curious if, by having such a large wait list capacity to begin with, along with the clear demand, if it's a sign that they'll likely open up the class sizes, assuming they can find adequate classroom space to accommodate the larger groups. TIA.",

If it's a gened or elective, some people will enroll in everything they can and then drop classes as they decide. \n\nIf it's a 400 level class that fuffils an important graduation requirement, your chances are a lot lower. Most seniors know exactly what they want and are unlikely to change their mind",

A professor told me that they will still be accommodated, but I thought they would be required to take a summer course or even stay another year. I have an online friend who is forced to stay another year at his university for this reason. But JMU is an expensive school and not even financial aid covers much so I wouldn't be able to afford another year. I'm already worried.",

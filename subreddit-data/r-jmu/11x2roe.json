Most people in this program have Macs, and the rest either have Windows or Linux. Anything will work in this program so go with what you feel is the best machine for you. This is my last semester and not once have I not been able to do anything in my classes because of my MacBook. Besides, a lot of the time you will be using SSH to remotely connect to the CS lab machines.\n\nThe commenter said that a Mac would be hell because of JMU\u2019s use of Microsoft? Simply false as any apps are easily downloadable on Mac.\n\nThe CIS program is much different than the CS program. That is where I would recommend Windows or it would be difficult.",

            "comment": "Graduating cs major here, get something you are familiar with is the number one goal. At all cost you need to be able to troubleshoot your machine yourself if something isn\u2019t working so get one that your comfortable with.\n\nNow I will say I have only had two times were a professor said having a Mac would be difficult as certain programs would be finicky. I can\u2019t remember what they were sorry I just remember there was a warning. \n\nAlso to the point of something that will have a long battery realistically by ur third or fourth year the battery prolly won\u2019t last a full day on one charge. Best advice invest early in a spare charger you can leave in your bag. Always helpful to have and if u ever forget to charge your laptop you aren\u2019t stranded. \n\nHope you found this helpful and for reference I use a windows machine, personally I prefer it and think it\u2019s more straightforward. Again just get whatever your comfortable troubleshooting.",

It lasted me close to 10 years before I had to do any major repairs. A Mac is probably not ideal for a CS major as most of the stuff you will be working on will probably be windows based.",

So if you are planning on getting a MacBook you shouldn\u2019t worry. Every single application we use can be downloaded for MacOS and it is just as optimized as the Windows products. \n\nThat being said, you should have no problem with any laptop as long as it isn\u2019t an 8 year old Chromebook. \n\nStorage shouldn\u2019t be too much of a concern, however, I do think that at least 1TB of storage is recommended.",

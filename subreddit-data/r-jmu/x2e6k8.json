    "postText": "I\u2019m a senior this year and I\u2019ve never really noticed this before. But it seems like this year almost every building I go into has the bathroom doors propped open. \n\nWhat is the reason for this? Is it some safety/fire concern? Otherwise I just don\u2019t get it. Many of the bathrooms at jmu are small anyways why would we need half of the bathroom visible?\n\nI can somewhat understand if it\u2019s a safety concern with so many students going in and out, but it just seems odd to lessen the privacy by keeping the doors open.",

I can see the practical reason to let more circulation in to dry floors faster etc.\n\nBut it\u2019s just odd to me that all three floors of bathrooms can have their doors propped open and janitors are nowhere to be found. (Near the bathroom anyways)\n\nP.s no janitor hate here, they\u2019re doing the job many of us would never do.",

    "postText": "I am looking to rush and would like to join a frat that is well rounded on the social and academic side.  It is hard to see which ones are like this through social media. I am not interested in any ones that are 100% partying all the time or have hazing that can be on the dangerous side. I know some frats have some form of it but prefer ones that keep their pledges safe.",

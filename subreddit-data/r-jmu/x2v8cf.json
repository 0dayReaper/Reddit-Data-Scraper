    "postText": "I came to JMU thinking I wanted to do computer science though once I actually started I realized just how much I don't really want to do this for a living and I have made a appointment with a advisor to change my major. I know he will help me pick another one but I would atleast like some thoughts or opinions from others. I'm looking for something related to computers but more on the hardware side and less of the software side and I've even considered engineering the only thing holding me back from that is my poor performance when it comes to math and things like it.",

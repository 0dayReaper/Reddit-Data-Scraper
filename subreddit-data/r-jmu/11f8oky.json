            "comment": "ABET accreditation requires a lot of nonsense that doesn\u2019t line up with the goals of JMU\u2019s CS curriculum. Accreditation would require doing a whole lot more math, raising the barrier of entry to the program, and making the program a lot less flexible. The CS program really prides itself in having a lot of open elective spots where you can explore your interests outside of CS, and we\u2019d lose that if we got ABET accredited.\n\nThere\u2019s also a question of the value of ABET accreditation. As someone who graduated from JMU CS, ABET accreditation has never once been a concern when applying for jobs or when recruiting for positions at my company.",

In the software world this is only needed for highly specialized work (As far as I know only some specialized safety critical work). If this is something you want you can still get your masters from a ABET accredited masters program.",

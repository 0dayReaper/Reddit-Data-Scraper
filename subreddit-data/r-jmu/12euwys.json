The reason for why they want to do this is because its generally recommended for students to have 2 years on campus and 2 years off campus as to acclimate them for off-campus living. \n\nJMU currently doesn't have enough space all of the freshman and sophomores to live on campus but the village renovations are supposed to fix that.",

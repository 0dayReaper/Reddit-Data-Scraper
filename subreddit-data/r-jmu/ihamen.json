They forced tens of thousands of students from all over the country to travel into the state and have  ignored plenty of reasonable safety precautions. \n\nThe fact that people are forced to attend in-person just to get credit for participation or to take an exam is inexcusable. If I were still a student, I'd be furious that I was spending all this money and didn't have a say in my own safety. If JMU is truly ready to go online at any moment, then classes should have just started out with that capability built-in and made in-person attendence optional. \n\nNeedless to say, they won't be getting a dime from me ever again. Unlike most, I didn't have a problem with them charging full price for online classes. The faculty and resources offered still can't compete with other institutions even if classes are remote. The fact that they've buried their head in the sand and forced people into making difficult and potentially life-altering decisions just for PR is disgusting.\n\nI have very little patience these days for anyone who makes ill-informed decisions regarding COVID. We've watched the rest of the world manage the virus with reasonable success, but the U.S. can't be bothered to pivot, adapt, and follow the science.",

It sucked to pay full rates for online learning, but they had a budget and I'm assuming when the budget was made they never even considered a pandemic would happen.  But this semester, it's obvious to all of us that a semester cannot last.\n\nIt's understandable from the university's point of view: years of financially cavalier decisions have forced them to throw current students into this shitshow.  This whole situation has revealed what we all already knew, but didn't want to say: the American higher education system is rotten to the core.\n\nI am a recent graduate so I won't be suing anybody, but I'm concerned current outraged students will feel taking on an entire university is impossible and choose not to take legal action, which is wholly understandable.",

Seeing students playing a 20 person game of mask-less spike ball on the quad, breathing down each other's necks in dining halls, gathering in large groups off campus without masks, etc. shows a lack of common sense and shows yet again that a portion of the JMU community believes that rules do not apply to them.",

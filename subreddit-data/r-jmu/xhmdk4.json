If you're in a bigger dorm, you'll probably be on duty once or twice every two weeks. In smaller dorms, it'll probably be closer to once or twice a week. \n\nIt should also be pointed out that being on duty, most of the time, is you sitting in the RA office for a few hours twiddling your thumbs (or at least, it was when I was an RA). You have to do rounds, but presuming no one is doing anything too dumb, being on duty is a pretty great time to do homework, read, play video games, listen to music, etc. \n\nThey also give you a set amount of days off (when I was there I belive it was something like 4 a month) where they don't expect you to be in the building or help with anything, and they get on you to use all of them.",

When I was in Potomac Hall, Sunday-Thursday and Friday-Saturday were scheduled separately, but it basically rotated through the entire staff before it got to each person again.  When you have 13 RAs like Potomac Hall had at the time, you did a weekday shift about 2-3 times a month, and a weekend shift about once every two months or so.\n\nAlso, with time off, the expectation there, at least with my hall director, was that you were to be *completely out of the building*. \n I considered that to be a bit unreasonable, considering that we were still responsible for our own room rent and meal plan, and were paid a separate salary for the RA job.  Translated, I pay for my room, so who are you to tell me that I can't use it?  But my hall director gave me a whole lot of shit for going on a weekend adventure, but still sleeping in my dorm room.  If I recall, that was the last time that I ever formally requested time off, because if the expectation that I was not supposed to use the room that I paid for, I had no use for it.",

If you take a day off, you basically can be anywhere you want, whenever you want.\n\nOtherwise, I believe you had to be at or near the dorm around like 8 or 9 PM on the weekdays, but I don't know/remember if there was an extension on weekends. And honestly, I wouldn't be shocked if the rules have totally changed over the last few years. You might want to email the people in charge of the RA program and ask them.",

Now, they have that laundry stipend, special meal plans, a rent reduction, guaranteed air conditioning, and a guaranteed single room.\n\nThat last part is a major game changer, because back when I was an RA, only RAs in dorms that were newly built, recently renovated, or Lake area got singles.  So if you were assigned to Blue Ridge, Chesapeake, Potomac, Chandler, Eagle, Shorts, Converse, Ashby, Gifford, Logan, or Wampler, you got a single room.  Any other dorm, you had to have a roommate, because they allegedly couldn't afford to give all of the RAs single rooms all at once.",

There's some pretty great RAs and Hall Directors and the compensation was pretty ok. I worked in freshman dorms both my years as an RA, so being able to help people as they're transitioning into college is pretty rewarding.

Breaking that first-year RA salary out into monthly installments comes to roughly $497.44 per month, with a number of additional perks.  When I started as an RA in August 2001, we were paid $405 per month, with no additional perks other than maybe a single room, depending on the building.  The salary number hasn't kept up with inflation over the years, as the $405 monthly compensation would be [$675.77 when adjusted for inflation](https://imgur.com/1LXKtDh).  I don't have enough information to calculate the value of the other perks, like rent discounts and special meal plans, though some of those perks, like the room discount and the special meal plans, primarily benefit the parents.\n\nI also wonder about how my RA experience might have gone had I had a more \"normal\" hall director.  Being in Potomac Hall, my hall director was a full-time employee of the university, and she had a major chip on her shoulder that stemmed from a lack of confidence, feeling as though she constantly had to prove herself and show off in order to make herself appear half as good.  She always wanted instant results, and was too quick to discard ideas, often before things had a chance to fully work.  My favorite case of this was where she once told me that she had tried five different supervisory styles on me without success.  I was a bit blindsided by that, and at the time, I thought something must have been wrong with me, with so many styles\u2019 not working.  I realized years later that the reason that none of them worked was because she didn\u2019t wait for me to adjust to a certain style before deciding that something didn\u2019t work, and never communicated any of these changes with me.  So all I got was an inconsistent boss who, despite her best efforts, just left me confused and hesitant to go to them, because I didn't know which version of them I was going to get at any given time.  Additionally, my hall director tried to micromanage aspects of my life that had nothing to do with work, which I considered to cross a line.\n\nThat said, if I were to do it all over again, I probably wouldn't be an RA, and instead would have found something else to do for extra money in college that didn't involve a department that tried to control every aspect of your life.  I definitely resented the idea that for the paltry compensation that we were provided, we were essentially always an RA, even when we were away from our buildings or off campus.",

Just not sure I agree with this comment.  While \"the parents\" in many cases share the burden of paying for college, I would never think that a student that earns money by doing something on campus only benefits the parents.  The student is trying to become a better person by going to college.  The fact that they are helping to pay for that should be looked at as them helping themselves, not the parents.",

If your residents respect boundaries, you will spend most days not on duty to yourself if you choose it to be that way. Your experience is heavily tied to where you are and who you are working with.\n\nAnd some more information because it's REALLY hard to find out there:\n\nBenefits:\n-1.5k off of housing PER SEMESTER\n-Around $230 biweekly your first year after taxes. Total pay before taxes is something like $4,475 for the academic year\n-RA Parking spots (in places like K Lot, D1 next to the bio building, in front of Forbes, and many others) and ability to park in commuter and Resident lots w/ RA parking pass \n-$100 laundry stipend per semester\n-Increased pay for successive years\n-Opportunity to become an undergraduate hall director (which I am not qualified to speak of responsibilities), where you are payed significantly more\u2014$6,480 for the academic year\u2014as well as having a free apartment with private bathroom and kitchen. HUGE!\n\nResponsibilities:\n-1-credit 2 hour a week class for half the semester your first semester only with mandatory attendance but zero difficult work \n-Around a two-week (ish) training before the year starts, ending in move-ins. \n-1:1's with your HD either weekly or biweekly depending on hall\n-ICONs: where you talk to residents about their experiences on campus. Can take up to 45 mins/resident but NOT difficult, just talking and only once per semester. \n-Depending on your hall, duty can be as few as six times a month or much, much higher. Some buildings \"share\" duty with other buildings, meaning that your staff works with another hall's staff so the workload is more even. For me, I have 3 weekends this month, and 3 weekdays which is less than typical. Duty on weekdays is 9pm-11pm, with the hall office phone being connected to your in-room phone. Weekend duty is 9pm-2am in the hall office, same till 8am responsibility on the phone. Depending on the size and... attitude of your hall, you can get many calls at all hours of the night or no calls at all. \n-Programming, or making activities for residents. You can *really* phone it in with these, but you can also make them legitimately beneficial and there are a ton of ways to do that on the cheap. I recommend the latter always.\n\nIf you want any more info, feel free to reach out! There's a ton of stuff not mentioned here that is relevant to the job description.\n\nTl;dr, It is a lot of work and the pay is not the greatest. You need to be willing to learn how to navigate difficult situations (i.g. mental health, self-harm, drug and alochol use, SA, and everything else under the sun), but if you are a sociable person who really needs the housing discount and does not want to travel for their job then it is a terrific opportunity.",

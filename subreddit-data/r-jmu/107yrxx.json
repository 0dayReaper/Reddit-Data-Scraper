Obviously far from campus and can be a little sketchy if you\u2019re walking by yourself, but if you only plan to use your car to return home for breaks then it\u2019s a possible option that\u2019s free.",

(it's a pretty long stretch with tons of space so you never really have to try and maneuver your car) all the time (did it my entire freshman year and never got caught) though I did move my car every week at least. You can also take the bus right to it.",

Fall semester I used a company like this [https://www.freshmenparking.com/park-at-jmu](https://www.freshmenparking.com/park-at-jmu) to park in an off-campus paid lot. There should be bus stops that are pretty close. It was a little pricey, but definitely worth it.\n\nThe second way was also mentioned in several comments, but I had an upperclassmen friend in Southview that didn't have a car and let me use their parking pass. \n\nNot sure if they still do this, but I'd bring my car to campus during the weekends because there were no parking passes needed on weekends at the time.\n\nHope this helps!",

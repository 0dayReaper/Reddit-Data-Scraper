Is it mostly undergrads or grad students? \n\n2) When will we find out unit assignments at the cottages?\n\n3) Closest grocery store to cottages without car?\n\n4) I\u2019m international and will need to fly in/out of DCA in order to be budget friendly. Dulles and Richmond are more $. I won\u2019t have a car. How do I get to DCA? Is is do-able? Any advice on this pls help I\u2019m getting rlly stressed about not being able to go home. \n\n5) How would you rate undergrad psych course difficulty? Are profs supportive?",

            "comment": "Another international student here! I\u2019ve primarily used Dullus, so seconding the Virginia Breeze &amp; other buses that drop you off at major airports in DC. You get your ticket in advance, and the bus picks you up from the airport (there\u2019s a spot for your luggage) and drops you off at the JMU bookstore (center of campus). Same for transportation to DC - it leaves from the bookstore and takes you right to the door of the airport you want. Tickets have gotten more affordable too. I\u2019m graduating this year and still don\u2019t have a car, but I\u2019ve never had any issue with getting around Harrisonburg/getting home. \n\nIf you need to get to DC for shorter trips (or just leave the city), there\u2019s a Facebook group called JMU Rides where you can request/join different trips to various places. I used it my freshman year before I made friends/found the bus system when I had to get to DC last minute. \n\nBest of luck!",

Foodlion is a close 2nd at a 17 minute walk.\n\n4) There is a coach service that runs from JMU up to DC (https://www.jmu.edu/transportation/regional-and-break-shuttles/coach-bus-services.shtml). Looks like it will take you to Dulles or Union Station in DC. From there you can catch public transportation/rife service to Regan (DCA).\n\n5) Couldn't tell ya. I've heard David Daniels might be good?",

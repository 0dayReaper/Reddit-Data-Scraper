Go to class everyday and take good notes and you might not even have to read or study. Tests are online and doesn\u2019t take attendance. Have found myself interested in more than a few of the lectures because he covers a lot of interesting authors",

Yanacek was my German professor for a couple semesters and she really strives to meet students where they are at with the material and still make it worthwhile for everyone. She typically uses a variety of assignment mediums and styles to work with the curriculum including presentations, (generally) short essays, and interpretive projects. Would definitely consider it if I were still a student. \n\nGranted, all of that is very dependent on class size and how much material there is but she makes herself very available with office hours should you need help or further insight. I never had more than 15 classmates in my German classes with her.",

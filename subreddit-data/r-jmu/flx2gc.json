I imagine that turnout will probably be much lower because it's going to be a hard ask to get everyone to come back to dwell on the past.  People will have mentally moved on, and I'm sure that many won't be able to make it or willing to go.\n\nIn other words, I think that for many, the moment will have passed, and there will be no replacing it.",

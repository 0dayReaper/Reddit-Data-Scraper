    "postText": "I struggled heavily at Laurel Ridge. Passed my first semester with flying colors, but my second semester I had to withdraw. Not because of grades, but because of mental health issues-I  had an extremely difficult job as a CNA at one of the hospital's medsurg floors, and when I told the clinical coordinator about my situation, as well as my professors, I was told \"oh well, just try and cope and take care of yourself, we can't accomodate your situation\". \n\nOtherwise, though, I'd been scoring pretty high on tests. \n\nAlso, would you recommend JMU to nursing students right after high school? Because it did not seem like Laurel Ridge was like that at all. Every student I know who's gotten into their nursing program right after  high school has failed.",

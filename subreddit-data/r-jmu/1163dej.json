Alternatively, I had friends who went to a VCCS school for only a year. Earned 4.0 average and transferred in without needing an associates. \n\nEnsure all of your classes will transfer beforehand if you go this route. \n\nThis would save you money and will give you the opportunity to establish residency in Harrisonburg to get in-state tuition before transferring. \n\nGood luck",

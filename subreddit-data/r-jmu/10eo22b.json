    "postText": "Like the title suggests I have been deferred from the most competitive area in Virginia and am feeling absolutely crushed at the moment and looking for perspective from some either currently deferred (I feel You) or anyone who has and got in regular decision after. As someone from the Northern Virginia area I knew this school would be flooded with people from the area making it extremally competitive. What did I do wrong though? While yes my junior year grades were ok but not amazing I added rigor that year to try and challenge myself and have a 3.61 (not the best but ok) and already knew that my grades wouldn't get me in alone. I've had a job since 8th grade and was a founding member on my high schools crew team so literally starting a club from the ground up. I've placed 1st and 2nd at state level rowing and done years of Deca competitive events at my school and state level. I have a letter of rec from my employer of 2+ years and still got deferred? Am I crazy?",

For the time being, JMU just wants more time seeing your application against others who may be closer to scale. \n\nI was deferred and rejected from my top school so I ended up here. I was destroyed but simply a new door opened and I\u2019ve enjoyed the time I\u2019ve had here. \n\nSo have hope in the next round. CNU and VCU are wonderful choices and I\u2019m sure no matter where you end, you\u2019ll do great.",

The majority of applicants did everything right. The hard part is setting yourself apart from the other eight zillion folks who are all trying for that relatively small handful of spots; in a crowd that big, it's really, really difficult. I guess what I'm saying is, try not to beat yourself up or second-guess yourself. As hard as it is, hang on for regular decision but also get your pivots percolating. You'll land on your feet.",

It only accounts for GPA and SAT, but my son found it very useful to set his expectations. You can see that quite a few got waitlisted last year (at least at our high school).\nDid you submit test scores? If you\u2019re above 1150, you\u2019re in the 75th percentile, and you should. Check out the common data set to see how you compare to last year\u2019s incoming freshman class.\nJMU is more selective than GMU, ODU, VCU and Longwood. You have a strong GPA, and a good shot.

I\u2019m from LCPS and we do also use Naviance my mom and I used it lots during the application process and i\u2019ve been checking the scatter plot data for all my schools since sophomore year. I didn\u2019t submit scores because when i took practices I would get an embarrassingly low score \ud83d\ude05. While i don\u2019t have en exact percentile for you when you look at the scatter plot I was with the cluster of green checks in the middle maybe upper middle some schools. In terms of common data set that\u2019s something I just learned recently somehow? and have been reviewing for all my schools. I\u2019ve gotten into CNU and VCU so far so i will update my original post to assure it\u2019s not the end of the world.",

I had already put my deposit down at CNU and ended up forfeiting the $500 or whatever it was. It was definitely very stressful but everything ended up working out in the long run.

    "postText": "I\u2019m writing on behalf of my sister who is a junior in HS. I took her on a tour of JMU and she fell in love but we haven\u2019t really gotten any consistent advice on whether she can get in. \n\nShe has a 3.49 unweighted GPA through sophomore year. She is taking 2 APs and a few honors classes this year (junior year) and she plans on taking the SAT, submitting a personal statement, and letters of recommendation even though they\u2019re optional. She wants to do nursing but she would also do history if she doesn\u2019t get into nursing. \n\nThe tricky part is the stats from her school. She goes to a good Catholic high school in NOVA. Last year 127 people applied and only 41 were accepted which is way below JMU\u2019s normal acceptance rate. She feels like she doesn\u2019t stand a chance now cause she thinks she needs straight As but she was so excited on the tour and it\u2019s her dream school. Her grades kinda sucked freshman year because of covid and she struggled with getting work done due to ADHD/depression/anxiety even though she is really bright. \n\nCan anyone give us clarity on her chances/advice on how to get in?",

            "comment": "In my personal opinion, I think she'll be fine. JMU accepted so many freshmen this year they had to use some of the sorority buildings for housing. They are pretty lenient with acceptance and if she does semi-well on the SAT and submits all of the information you mentioned (letter of rec, personal essay), I think she'll be good.",

If she can tap into some interests or values that are significant and meaningful for her and highlight those ideas well in her essay on the app, I\u2019d say she\u2019s got great odds with the info you provided.",

In addition, I also did poorly freshman year but had a solid Sophomore and Junior and was able to write my essay from the perspective that my high school career shows that it doesn\u2019t matter how you start it matters how you finish (she could incorporate similar ideas if she\u2019s worried regarding her Freshman year). I was able to get in early action which I reccomend she does as well because she can still get in regular if she\u2019s deferred. \nI honestly think she stands a really good chance of getting in. I\u2019m not sure if it makes a difference but I am an out of state student.",

I got in with like a 3.1 in 2018 because I applied myself very little in HS BUT my SAT &amp; ACT were outstanding + I had a lot of extracurriculars. Just make sure the essay is solid and show them that you\u2019ve been active in your HS besides just academics!",

I\u2019m fairly sure as a public institution JMU tries to accept a sample of students from across VA. The issue with this is a student from Bristol with a 3.1 and 1100 might make it in over your sister, simply due to the fact that their being better students to pick from (from the catholic school). If this is becoming a huge concern for her she needs to find a way to elevate herself amongst her peers on the essay or through other means. \nI hope this helps !",

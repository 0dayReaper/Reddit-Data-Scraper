            "comment": "1. Remember that you can choose who your professor will be in College so try to research your professors ahead of time to see which professors are actually good or not\n2. Having an on campus job is better than an off campus one since if you work on campus you are more likely to find employers who respect your time (mostly) and will try to work your work times around your schedule\n3. Check your emails! Emails can typically have important information regarding classes or JMU related events and professors do expect you to keep track of your emails\n4. Office Hours, professors have time outside of class where you can visit them and ask questions related to stuff regarding class\n5. Take advantage of free resources JMU offers, JMU offers a ton of resources that are free to students. Some can be really helpful such as the University Writing and the University Career Center\n6. Join Clubs! JMU has 400+ clubs on campus that cover a wide variety of interests. Have a hobby? There is probably a club for that. There are also clubs related to sports such as Track &amp; Field, Dodgeball, Ultimate Frisbee, and more. They can be great ways to find friends who have similar interests to you. I personally have made most of my college friends this way. (Also btw I am an officer for two clubs on campus so reach out to me if you want to know more about clubs)",

It doesn't matter if you're a morning person, you will have days where you want (or need) to sleep in, and 8 a.m. classes ruin that. Plus you run the risk of sleeping in and missing those classes. 11 am-5 pm is the best time to schedule classes.",

Academics is your priority you came to college it decides the next 80 years of your life. Don\u2019t settle down with one girls that just beta; be friendly af but at the same time if someone shit talks you, you go harder on them. Number one thing be confident this is your life not your roomates not your suite mates not your hometown friends that didn\u2019t go to college. Make it what you want live your life how you want block out extra noise. \n\nHope my tips worked out for ya - TheLegend27",

    "postText": "Hi, I am an incoming freshman for next year. I want to rush AEPi but I have a few questions about it. What is it like compared to other frats? Are there lots of parties? And just overall, how is their reputation on campus? Other than AEPi, I was wondering what professional fraternities are on campus. Im gonna be a CS major so if there are any professional frats geared towards engineering please let me know!",

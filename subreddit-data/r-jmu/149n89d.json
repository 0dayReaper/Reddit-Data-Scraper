    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman and I need help with schedule creation. I'm looking to apply to the SMAD major, and I'm likely taking the SMAD 101 class in the fall, as it is the only first-sem class for the major. I've added one pre-req class from the worksheet, this being Business Decision Making, but I'm not sure what else to put on my schedule. \n\nI scored a 5 on my AP Lang exam, so I don't need to take Writing, and I'm not entirely sure what the deal is with taking a math class first semester for SMAD. So are there any electives or other core requirements that any of you, either SMAD or not, would recommend taking for someone who is looking to fill the gaps in my schedule? Thanks so much to anyone who is able to help out! :)",

Honestly there were so many options I mostly just focused on picking classes that were at a convenient time for me so I could make a schedule I really liked. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about taking any electives yet, you\u2019ll have plenty of time for those later on. I personally didn\u2019t take any until my sophomore year and just focused on gen eds as a freshman.",

            "comment": "Granted, I majored in IBUS in 2009 so take me with a grain of salt.\n\nIt's good, and I had some great experiences in the language and study abroad, but in retrospect, I probably would have chosen something else like CIS.\n\nIt gives you a small bit of focus on a wide variety of topics without really diving into one in particular.  Kind of like how for COB 300 you take an intro-level course to marketing, management, operations, etc, you generally just take the intro level to those with \"international\" in front of it .  I think the main benefit is that, at least when I was there, you were required to do a semester abroad, and that can give you some good experience in the language and culture of the area you choose, as well as good anecdotes for interviews (and great stories overall) that can give you a leg up.\n\n  A lot of the \"international\" parts are things like \"for management, in international business, you will deal with a lot of different cultures!  They can be different!  Enjoy and accommodate them!  For accounting, there are different considerations for working with different currencies and accounting systems!  Enjoy and accommodate them!\"\n\nI was able to get a job straight out of college right at the height of the 2009 recession at a big consulting firm doing general domestic business things, and overall I wouldn't say that you'll graduate and have no prospects because having ANY business degree is good; but with my personal career field/path, looking back in hindsight I would have loved to have learned more Python/coding things to do more work in data because I just don't have any sort of international work.\n\nI was able to do the path where I had to do COB300, and that was absolutely worth it - great experience, great resume builder, and something to talk about during job interviews",

Probably best to do one of those and just pursue a company that is interesting to you.  \n\nExample, I did accounting and work for private equity firms, and have done the accounting for the company's fund in South America.  \n\nI had considered int business as a major but am glad I did accounting.",

                    "comment": "I did international business and the international affairs people who make these claims are often times the ones who never put in the work to get accepted into cob and complete cob 300. IB has three concentrations, finance, marketing, and general. As another comment mentioned, the best majors in cob are accounting, finance, and cis. Stuff like marketing and management just doesn\u2019t have the job security for people right out of college. IB does give a great background knowledge in various fields and concentrations of business both domestically and internationally. However, I felt as though it\u2019s geared towards preparing someone who will be traveling and holding managerial and senior positions, which is unlikely for a recent college grad. If you still find yourself choosing this major, my suggestion for your resume appearing most attractive to employers is to seek the finance concentration, hold at least one internship, and speak a second language fluently. Just completing the language minor requirement won\u2019t mean much if an employer asks you to complete a language assessment in their hiring process.",

I graduate next semester and have obtained 3 internships at this point. I\u2019m not seeking to change my major at this point because that would be flat out stupid and financially irresponsible.",

What's the bass note under the mystery note?\n2. What's the key of the example?\n3. What's the solfege of the melody and where do certain syllables typically lead? \n\nI would also encourage you to take this down, because it really looks like you're trying to get someone to tell you the answer and it wouldn't be good if your professor found your post somehow.",

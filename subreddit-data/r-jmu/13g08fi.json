            "comment": "I just moved out of bluestone yesterday and overall it was a really good experience! It\u2019s super close to any main campus classes, so if you\u2019re taking a lot of gen-ed\u2019s then it makes sense. If you\u2019re coming in with credit and plan to take any stem classes then I would suggest Shanendoah or a dorm on east. Definitely depends on ur major but in general as a freshman, Bluestone is one of the best options in my opinion. Also Hillside (I believe) has you sharing a bathroom with 6+ people, Bluestone you just share w your roommate and 2 others so it\u2019s significantly more convenient imo!",

Everyone was so nice and ehall was right outside. I recommend hall 2b. One of my friends is an RA there next year. It\u2019ll be very chill.",

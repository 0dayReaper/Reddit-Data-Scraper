            "comment": "I was in a fraternity at jmu and recently graduated. The point of them for the brothers is networking once you are in post grad. I know lots of guys who got jobs within the same company because one of the higher ups were in the same fraternity from a different chapter. \n\nA second reason for fraternities as a brother is for the brotherhood which goes into the first point as well. It\u2019s hard to make friends at such a large school like JMU but if you make it through the process and become a brother you automatically have 100 guys who have your back through thick and thin. One of my pledge brothers parent died a few years back and the guy was devastated (obviously). The boys sent flowers to his family and also were there for him when he wanted to reach out to some of us to talk about how he was feeling. He stated right before he graduated that he would\u2019ve left school because how he felt but didn\u2019t because he loved us and we loved him so much. \n\nThere\u2019s the obvious superficiality of fraternities (frats) of partying and drinking and I will say that\u2019s a big part of why I wanted to rush. It\u2019s fun and all but if that\u2019s what the whole fraternity revolves around then it\u2019s a glorified drinking club. Party\u2019s should happen but if you want to get the right things out of fraternity\u2019s then drinking and partying should be an added bonus. This is what fraternities lose after 100 members sometimes. Luckily mine didn\u2019t and I was still able to have a great time and it made my time at jmu an amazing experience. If you\u2019re able to I think everyone should rush a fraternity or sorority (I can\u2019t add much on them bc of the length of this response lmfao). Hope this helps!",

            "comment": "The other comments explain what fraternities and sororities are/do pretty well. A rundown of the basic ones really depends on personal preference. Generally, you want to avoid any frat that's off campus (PBX, TKE, ATO, Dchi) not because the people necessarily are bad, but because the exec team didn't do a good job and they got kicked off. There are no banned sororities at the moment so don't worry about them. Best parties and nicest people are pretty subjective, but I'll try and lay it out.\n\nBest parties (not in order): Theta Chi, Phi Psi, AEPI (sometimes), Pike (questionable dudes sometimes but a party is a party), Fiji (they're pretty reasonable dudes despite the public opinion), Beta, Lambda. Sometimes Dsig if you're lucky. Also if you're a man good luck getting into these unless you have some connections. Sororities don't really throw unless it's a date function, semi-formal, or formal, so consider those on a case by case basis. \n\nNicest people (also not in order and including frats and sororities): \n\nFrats: Theta Chi, Beta, Phi Psi, AEPI, Lambda, KDR, Sig Nu\n\nSororities: ADPI, Tri Sig, AST, usually Aphi, Phi Sig (sometimes), Phi Mu\n\nPLEASE remember that this is purely my opinion based on the people in these organizations that I've met. Other people will have different rankings based on their own experiences, and I urge you to consider these organizations based on your interactions with them, not mine. Hope this helps.",

            "comment": "As someone in a fraternity starting 2005 at JMU (I will not say which) there was an uncomfortable mix of regular dudes and blatant racists. Some of the guys I was in with are still some of my best friends but others are people that I absolutely despise. Of course, your mileage may vary but just understand that perception is reality and if you align yourself with these groups that this could be a criticism leveled at you as well, regardless of whether you engage in that behavior or not.\n\nAdditionally, all frats are gonna have some weirdos in there because they have to maintain numbers.\n\nI can speak about some early 2000s stories if anybody wants to hear.\n\nEdit: I didn't graduate the first time but I eventually came back for grad school and finished up last year, so there is hope for people that fucked up the first time.\n\nI didn't graduate because I was too party focused and maybe JMU wasn't the right fit for me originally and a frat certainly wasn't for me, but choices were made and we all exist in the choices we have made.",

            "comment": "I'm not apart of a frat but the main gist of frats abd sororities is that they are chapters of a larger organization. Each chapter represents a different field of study (i.e. you have a frat for business, engineering, etc.) There are specific guidelines to join a frat such as academic year, standing, etc. Usually there is an initiation ceremony involved which varies based on frat/sorority. They do claim to do other things outside of parties like the obligatory service project done which is done to keep in standing with the university. To answer your question about banned frats/sororities, there are a few banned frats/sororities on campus because of hazing controversies and they do try to claim that they're in talks with JMU to return their standing with JMU. \n\nAlso I forgot to mention but the difference between frats and sororities is gender. Frats are for makes and sororities are for females.",

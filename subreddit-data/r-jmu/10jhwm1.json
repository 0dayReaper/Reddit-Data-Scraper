    "postText": "Hello! I recently got accepted to JMU for Fall 2023, and I am trying to figure out which dorms may work best for me. While I do want to go into Marketing and likely be in the Business school, I am willing to travel a bit each day in exchange for quiet and comfort. I\u2019m looking for suite-style with air conditioning, and since I sent in my deposit the day I was accepted I\u2019m hoping to get my pick of dorms. I also would like to be near UREC as I plan to be very involved in weight training and swimming recreationally. I do want to go to parties, but it isn\u2019t my highest priority over a calm atmosphere. Thank you all for the help, I can\u2019t wait to be a Duke!!",

I don\u2019t think I ever had a night where I was too hot and usually had to turn down the AC because it worked so well",

Eagle gets hot the higher the floor you are on but honestly it\u2019s cooler after the first couple of weeks. It\u2019s right next to the business building too.\n\nThere\u2019s no mold. Can confirm this.\n\nIn both places I feel like it\u2019s easy to make friends.",

I know so many people who live in those dorms and they have been non-stop sick since Sept. \nMy friend told me her food (bread, fruit,etc.) goes bad within a day in her dorm in Frederikson. Everyone in her dorm is sick constantly sick with something. Another friend in Eagle showed me her air purifier filter is  filthy within a few days and the dehumidifier fills up very quickly. She has had pneumonia and the flu from living there. \nIt is true that village is the only suite style but I honestly would hate living there. The bathrooms are DISGUSTING, especially on the weekends. (Picture vomit, poop, pee, garbage in the showers.) The stall doors/walls are so low that everyone can see you. \nEast campus has the newer, cleaner dorms with a/c. Jennings is like living in a hotel, with private bathroom suites. But all of of East campus is hall style. \nGood luck!",

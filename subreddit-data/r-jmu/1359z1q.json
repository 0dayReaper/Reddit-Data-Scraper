My roommate and I didn\u2019t loft our beds, but we got bed risers that allowed us to put the dressers under the beds, which saves lots of space. We also put a wardrobe between the two desks, because by default they are side by side and that\u2019s weird.",

            "comment": "I lived in Hillside last year, and unless something changed, you can definitely loft the bed, just make it just high enough for the dresser to fit under it. I didn\u2019t get out much in freshman year because of Covid restrictions in the first semester, but most of the guys in my hall were nice. I think Hillside Hall is the best just because it\u2019s the closest to the rest of main campus and it has some perks that the other two don\u2019t (more common area activities, a computer lab, etc)",

Her desk was on our window wall, with the desk under the window and the bed in the corner. My bed ran along the side of the wall with our door; if I was laying in my bed and looked left, I\u2019d see the foot of her bed (I hope that makes sense!) We had risers, which was enough space for fridge and extra storage.",

We lived on the first floor where there are some study rooms so people were walking through all the time. We just kept our door open and made friends that way. It\u2019s between main campus and east campus so the walk isn\u2019t too bad no matter which way you go. \n\n I had a friend who lofted her bed and didn\u2019t have any issues other than being careful not to hit her head while climbing up there.",

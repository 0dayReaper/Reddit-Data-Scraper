I had to move rooms and was lucky enough to go to a 1 bedroom but my roommate was great and it felt like all the convenience of a dorm with all the freedom of an apt. The ra never bothered us or did checks and it was super quiet. Also if u like subway u will spend all ur money there :)",

The main down side is that you probably have to share a room with another person but other than that, when I filed a maintenance request, they came by literally the next day. The laundry is normally not too bad since each floor has its own and the vending machines are convenient in the main floor\u2019s kitchen. I only left because of roommate issues and couldn\u2019t fill an apartment. Plus, subway is on the ground floor, it\u2019s magic, trust.",

    "postText": "Whenever I use lockdown browser for my exam, the power options on my computer break (I can't turn it off or restart it), and I have to go back to a previous restore point to fix it. Last time this happened, some of my files even broke. It was also difficult to remove it from my computer. I can't use a VM to bypass installing it on my actual computer because it detects a VM since it thinks you're cheating which isn't my intention. I need to install Windows to a flash drive to use it now. It's required for JMU so there's no way out of using it. Anyone else have problems with it? It's such a pain.",

If you are forced to install it on your computer run it  from a live OS installed on a USB drive.\n\nIf you have to take the exam in a classroom on a laptop you might want to use a school laptop. I don't know if you can still check out one for a exam. IT or the Library should know more about this. The professor should also have the ability to check out a laptop cart for exams.",

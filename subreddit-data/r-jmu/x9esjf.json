After she said all this and told me I\u2019ll go to heaven after many many dialogues, I said \u201cwhat about Muslims\u201d then went on to say how because they don\u2019t believe Jesus is lord and savior, they\u2019re going to hell. Also the same for LGBTQIA+ members. If you want, talk to her to learn her true intensions.",

Im not completely locked in\u2026 yet. But even still I don\u2019t want my parents to have to get another hit in their credit if I apply elsewhere to live\u2026\n\nThat being said, this subrdddit has be worried about the quality of the building with the thin walls, windows that don\u2019t open, creepy hallways and rooftop parties of strangers. \n\nShould I run for the hills and cut my loses now? I know there are other spots open but I need to be quick\u2026 \n\nThanks!",

Best case scenario you\u2019ll like it and you can stay. Worst case scenario you don\u2019t like it and you\u2019ll have time to tour the other housing options. Might be a huge hassle to find alternatives this late in the game. That being said I hear sunchase is a-ok. I live in Arcadia and it\u2019s alright. If you call most places some have \u201cvisitors apartments\u201d that you can tour and see what you get. I didn\u2019t decide on Arcadia until after we saw the demonstrator home.",

Trust me from what I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s no JMU student housing worse then the village. You\u2019ll be fine. Even if it is a disaster you\u2019ll have a whole apartment and a non-hall style bathroom for six months. Even if there\u2019s a few headaches like the commute or loud neighbors those can be easy coped with and you\u2019ll get that stuff everywhere. Having a kitchen also comes in clutch.\n\nI\u2019ve had plenty of friends who lived in some real dumps and they\u2019re just fine. Some stayed out and just dealt with the problems. Others just moved after the lease was up and found a better spot.",

I feel like if you already have a lease, I would just do the altitude for a year, especially since it\u2019s such a pain to get approved for apartments in a short period of time.",

I have also lived in 2 other college living locations in Harrisonburg. I will say that Altitude was the worst. I don't mean to scare you, but it's the truth. I know a few others who believe the same.  \n\n\nGood Things:\n\n\\- Amazing size kitchen, probably the best I've had.\n\n\\- Separate rooms. I never heard my roommates on the other side of the apartment (and one played guitar and music out loud). I didn't have a 4th so it was basically silent in my room.\n\n\\- Individual air conditioning. Probably the best thing ever. Each room had its own AC unit in the window like a hotel plus a shared temp in the living area. Literally the best part of the apartment. I have yet to find this anywhere and I do miss it.\n\n\\- Right next to Walmart. It's not the massive one but it gets the job done with groceries.\n\n\\- Next to cottages (if you party this is a plus??)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBad Things:\n\n\\- Management/Staff when I was there was crap. Poorly maintained building, hallways, and facilities. Maintenance itself was fine, they responded to maintenance requests within the week. \n\n\\- Literally no community things. There's a rooftop lounge, which at once had dog shit (I hope it was a dog) on it. It's up in the mountains of hburg so it's always windy. Other than that, you have a gym (which only has treadmills, rowing, and free weight).\n\n\\- Entrances. The only street entrances was directly off of port rep and another on the side road. Snow on the ground? Forget the side entrance because that's a straight hill. The port entrance is hard, only a few yards away from the light so getting in left lane to do u-turn takes time.\n\n\\- No control? When I was there they had no parking passes, so literally anyone can park there. Their doors were \"key padded\" but I knew which doors were open all night so it wasn't secure. I've heard that a lot of random people like to use the rooftop lounge for parties who possibly don't even live there.",

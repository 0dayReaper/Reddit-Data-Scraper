They hate C\u2019s anywhere on your application. It says go to community college for a year. JMU is not a 5 and up AP class school. It\u2019s a less than 4 AP school. 2-3 AP classes won\u2019t have that great an impact on your GPA, but get one C and you\u2019re screwed. Instead of spending all that useless energy dong a ton of out of class work, study for the SAT. Get a 1160 up and you\u2019re in with a good GPA at JMU.. The cost benefit of a few AP classes is not worth it.  I took zero rigor. I took only 5 classes each of my sophomore, junior and senior year. Carried a 4.0 because 5 class load is easy in high school. Spent 1 hr a day studying my sat and after 3 months my sat score jumped from 1120-1300. I got in to Clemson, Penn state, Virginia Tech. Zero rigor. They are all getting thousands and thousands more applicants than usual. They have 5 min to sum u up. Race, GPA, SAT and read your essay for competency. 5 min. Make a decision. They all scan for C\u2019s on your course schedule. They don\u2019t got time for much else. Taking AP\u2019s for JMU is a poor risk to reward strategy. Top 50 schools you got no choice, but JMU? Just apply early and show interest with a solid resume, no need to overdo it.",

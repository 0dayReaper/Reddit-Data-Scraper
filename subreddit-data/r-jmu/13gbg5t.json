    "postText": "Thinking about rushing Alpha Omega Epsilon and/or Alpha Chi Sigma. I know quite a bit about AXS from my fellow chem majors, but not about AOE. What is the rushing process like? How much does AOE cost? What\u2019s the social like life? Just general thoughts on either of them? Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks &lt;3",

            "comment": "Hi I\u2019m actually in alpha omega epsilon! I absolutely love it and it genuinely helped me find my place on campus. A few answers to your questions:\nRushing Process: When I rushed the week was themed and you just did different activities surrounding the theme. This semester\u2019s was fairytale and we just did things like a craft night, potluck, etc. it\u2019s very lowkey, it\u2019s just for you to get to know the sisters and the other people you\u2019re rushing with. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s competitive, just be urself and make sure to put an effort into getting to know people and you\u2019ll be fine\nCost: I am not fully sure what you would consider expensive but it\u2019s way cheaper than the social sororities (I don\u2019t have a reference point with the other professional frats and sororities) the dues are most expensive when u first become an active (not that expensive, around the $100-$200 range if I remember correctly) and they get cheaper the longer you are in the sorority.\nSocial Life: there are parties but it\u2019s not a party every weekend kind of sorority. We have a lot of non-party related social events. I personally feel that it\u2019s a good mix of both. \nPersonal thoughts: I really love being apart of it. I was worried about joining a sorority because I\u2019ve heard a lot of horror stories about them, but I found out pretty quickly that every negative stereotype just simply didn\u2019t apply to aoe. I am a pretty shy person, but I genuinely have never felt judged or excluded in the sorority and it\u2019s been pretty awesome to get to know everyone and become friends with them. I do not know anything about axs as I am not a chem major, but I hope the info helped! Lmk if u have any more questions",

            "comment": "Hi! I just saw this and I'm also in AOE!!! AOE is like super lowkey, but also has a lot of good events that you can go to :) Since you said that you're a chem major, they'res actually a good amount of chem majors in AOE right now! I've been in it since rushing in Fall of 2021, and not gonna lie, I've gotten so much more confident and have had so many more opportunities just because I am in AOE. We do Sisterhood events, along with Professional and Academic, so its like you're getting the best of both worlds. For social events, they are ofc totally optional - I personally don't really go since that's not my vibe but there are a good amount of people in AOE who enjoy it and have fun. :) There are going to be a couple of interest meetings at the beginning of next semester if you want to stop by, but another good place to ask more questions would be our instagram!

I live in Montgomery County, Maryland, and the buildings there look similar to this, where the game used a lot of fillers.  The parking garage near where I work shows up looking like townhouses, and the row of townhouses that I live in near GAI airport looks like an apartment building.  But then you go into Howard County, Maryland (the next county north), and the buildings are practically picture-perfect.  My SO's parents' neighborhood in Ellicott City is accurate, and so are all of the stores in the shopping centers.",

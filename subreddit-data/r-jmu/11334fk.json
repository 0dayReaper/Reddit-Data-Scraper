    "postText": "Greetings!! I\u2019m hoping to go to JMU, but before I make my decision I must know if there are places suited to my needs. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a dark secluded area that is deeply connected to the Etherial plane. My rituals must not be disturbed, so seclusion is very important. Additionally I have an extensive collection of arcane texts and tomes that cannot be looked upon by mortal folk, lest their minds shatter in an attempt to comprehend them. Are they allowed on campus? \n\n\nThanks for all the help and good luck in your adventures!",

Vincent Clortho Academy despite it's [issues](https://youtu.be/j-2ZxldMO-M) is a much better school for this.\n\nIf you plan on getting your math and GenEds out of the way you might want to consider getting a AS in Math or a STEM major from the VCCS and then applying for the College of Winterhold. \n\nIf you are female you should also consider applying for Aretuza if you have a good natural aptitude for the arcane. Their financial aid program is one of the best and they put loads of effort into finding post college employment for their graduates.",

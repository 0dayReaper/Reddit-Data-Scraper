Unfortunately, too many people are quick to rush to judgment without doing any actual research, and they are also quick to criticize anyone who suggests that they actually do the research to make sure that if they're going to level a heavy accusation like this at someone that it is 100% accurate before firing.\n\nIt was similarly disturbing when someone posted [to advise people not to support a bar](https://www.removeddit.com/r/jmu/comments/p1wyi6/do_not_support_dukes_the_bar_or_latins_flavor_the/) a few weeks ago because of unfounded accusations against the owner of the bar.  It was ridiculous how quick people were to judge without any real proof, and also how, when I [questioned it](https://www.reddit.com/r/jmu/comments/p1wyi6/do_not_support_dukes_the_bar_or_latins_flavor_the/h8k6bcl/), the OP came back with an ad hominem attack based on television-related subreddits that I'm involved in.",

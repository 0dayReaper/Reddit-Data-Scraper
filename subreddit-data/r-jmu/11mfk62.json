    "postText": "Looking for someone to take over my lease for the Fall 2023 through Spring 2024 semester at Southview. It's a 4-bedroom apartment and the bedroom is a good size and has a nice size closet and each bedroom has its own bathroom. With the room, you get a bed, dresser, desk, and nightstand all included.\n\nRent is $459 a month starting in August. All utilities are included in the rate and the unit comes with a washer and dryer. Internet is included but you would just need to bring your own router or ask if one of your roommates would bring their own.\n\nSend a message and reach out if you're interested!",

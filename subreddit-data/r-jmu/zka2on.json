The members were all given alumni status (meaning that they couldn't join another frat), and a few people started an \"underground\" chapter that lasted a while before finally fizzling out.",

I remember that the big scandal in the fall of 2000 was the HPD's response to the big annual block party at the Forest Hills apartment complex, where they went in with full riot gear and it got rather ugly.\n\nThen there was also a very short-lived entertainment supplement in *The Breeze* in the spring semester of 2001, called \"Turf\".  That was intended to give the university community a chance to laugh at itself, and I thought it was hilarious.  Unfortunately, the university community demonstrated that it took itself far too seriously to ever be able to laugh at its more ridiculous aspects, and as such, it became very controversial.  I think that it only ever published like three issues before being cancelled.  I was disappointed, but JMU definitely showed its inability to laugh.\n\nI also was on campus for 9/11.  That was a weird time.  I was an RA in Potomac Hall at the time, and I didn't have classes until the afternoon that day.  I was awakened around 9:30 for a lockout, and I went down to take care of that, and waited down there for the key to come back, completely oblivious to world events.  Then after that, I needed to return a plunger to the housekeepers, and found them in the TV lounge up on the fifth floor.  Noticed the television, and, oh, that's not supposed to be like that.  Then I was glued to the television just like everyone else was, watching that whole event unfold.  The university never formally cancelled classes, and that was a bit of a mixed bag.  I think that it would have been perfectly justifiable to cancel classes that day, because honestly, no one was in any shape to learn that day, especially considering how many people at JMU are from the DC area and had family that they were concerned about.  I missed my first class, but then attended my other two.  I remember one professor stressed how we needed to maintain routine even in times like this, and gave the lecture that he had been planning to do all along.  My other class was PSYC 100, which was essentially Residence Life supplemental training, and that turned into discussing how to help our residents cope with 9/11.  Lots to unpack.  When I got back to Potomac, my hall director told us that we needed to stay in the building in order to be available for our residents.  I needed to go out and clear my head, and had been planning to walk down the hill to Sheetz.  I still ended up going to Sheetz, though I waited a few hours until I was confident that most people had gone to bed.",

The first \"Tree House\" dorms happened in the fall of 2000, and those were originally earmarked for transfer students. Then more frat houses became dorms in the following years as more frats moved off campus. The tree dorms got a hall director of their own for the first time in 2001.",

I was in band, played football and do volunteer work at my church. I also plan to take a community college course in the spring. I live in Maryland if that changes anything too.",

You\u2019re fine. Make sure you send a letter of interest when you apply and tell em why you wanna come here and anything not explained in your application.",

Did u send in any AP scores? Any leadership positions in clubs or extracurriculars? Strong Letters of rec? SAT/ATC scores (I know they're not mandatory anymore, but they help out if u send scores in). How consistent were u with ur extracurriculars and clubs? Admissions like seeing consistency. \n\nAnyways, I know college admissions is tough and stressful, but hold on to your hope. At the end of the day, it's a game of luck.",

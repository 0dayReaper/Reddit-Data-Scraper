I was in an extremely chill building but I wrote up maybe two or three people in the entire year I was an RA and never got in any trouble. What gets written up depends on how strict the RA is and how strict the Hall Director is.\n\nIt was an open secret that especially male RAs would never get fired because ORL was so short-staffed when I worked there. So RAs, especially male RAs could do all sorts of things without getting in trouble. Which is probably why you saw RAs doing the same things you would get written up for.\n\nI think they're doing a few things to improve compensation for RAs so maybe they're less desperate for staff now but since I'm not working for ORL anymore I have no idea.",

There was never a quota of any kind, but it was definitely a question about how much you needed to document. I went from one extreme to the other. My first year as an RA, I used to document *everything* because I was afraid of missing something and then having to answer for why I failed to document something. My second year as an RA, on the other hand, I only wrote maybe five of those things the entire year, and those were ones where I was obligated to, i.e. I had no option but to document because it was explicitly written in the manual that documentation was required for those occurrences.",

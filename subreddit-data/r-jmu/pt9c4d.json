    "postText": "As some of you have already noticed, two of the Quad\u2019s most iconic residents are missing: Jimmy and Dolley, the Quad Cats, were rehomed earlier this month and will no longer hold court in front of Burruss Hall and Carrier Library. \n\nQuad residents since 2010, Jimmy and Dolley have been unofficial main campus mascots and good luck charms. Following a bad leg injury during the summer, Jimmy was evaluated by a local vet who amputated the leg and recommended that Jimmy become an indoor-only cat.\n\nAfter Jimmy had recovered, caretakers picked up Dolley and took her to the vet for a health checkup before reuniting the siblings. At the checkup Dolley tested positive for feline immunodeficiency virus, or FIV, which meant being an indoor-only cat with Jimmy going forward was also in her best interests.\n\nSeveral people on-campus have taken care of the Quad Cats over the years, including CAL\u2019s own Laura Wisman who has been the main coordinator for their care since 2012. Following the vet\u2019s recommendations for both cats, Laura has adopted Jimmy and Dolley. \n\nWhile we will all miss the iconic pair lounging near the fountain and seeking affection from late-night library goers, they are happy and loved in their new home, and we hope they will be for many years to come.\n\nDo you have any photos of the Quad Cats? Did you get the chance to pet Jimmy or Dolley after a late night of studying in Carrier Library? Share your memories and photos with us and celebrate the Quad Cat's iconic reign!",

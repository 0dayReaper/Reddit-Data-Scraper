            "comment": "The reporting on this by WHSV and the Breeze is super sus. They keep using the phrase\"non-life-threatening,\" but five were sent to RMH and 3 were sent to UVA. It's not often that people are sent over the mountain to UVA without serious injuries. I mean, these people were SHOT. Maybe you shouldn't downplay it just because no JMU students were harmed, at least not this time.\n\n:somewhat unrelated rant:\n\nThere is a long standing trend in Harrisonburg that is not often talked about. JMU off-campus housing complexes have a habit of slowly degrading and eventually becoming run down low budget housing. There is always a strain on housing in Harrisonburg, and always a newer building that was slapped together to attract the current students. The old ones get taken over by non-students and a lot of the time these buildings are poorly secured and rapidly deteriorating. There have been lots of crime and drug activity in these aging student housing developments. I think Harrisonburg's major land developers need to build more sustainable housing and keep them maintained instead of just letting them deteriorate and become sketchy shitholes.",

Injuries/condition can still be severe, but they aren't going to use that phrasing unless they're sure the patients aren't facing critical condition/death.\n\nUnderstandably it's hard to believe some of the things passed down from police, but in this instance I wouldn't read too much into it.",

Just because the person isn't going to die from their wounds does not mean that their wounds aren't quite serious.  All that non-life-threatening means is that the patient isn't going to die on account of this.  Nothing more, nothing less.",

Police say an unknown individual or individuals fired multiple times into the crowd, resulting in eight individuals suffering non-life-threatening injuries. **According to a press release**, five of those individuals were treated at Sentara RMH, while three others were transferred to UVA. Those eight patients range in age from 18 to 27.\n\nhttps://www.whsv.com/2022/10/16/shooting-investigation-eight-suffer-non-life-threatening-injuries-harrisonburg/\n\nThat's not sus, that's WHSV attributing a statement to the police &amp; city officials, which is typical for reporting immediately following a crime. The Breeze also makes it clear they're getting this information from the city, but they could have worded it a little better.",

Like walking in groups is gonna stop someone from spraying bullets at you? Anyway, I can't wait to have to pretend like everything is normal in spite of this happening very close by. Also think it sucks how it keeps being downplayed with \"no Jmu Students were injured\" \"it was off campus\" etc.  I get the desire to calm anxious students and parents but JMU is IN Harrisonburg!",

Despite that it is largely populated by students, it is still not a part of the university campus, and these complexes do not exclusively rent to students.",

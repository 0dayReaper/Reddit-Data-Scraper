    "postText": "I'm currently living in Squire Hill on Devon ln., whose internet is supplied by Single Digits. Single Digits is hands-down the worst internet provider I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. For those currently living in The Altitude, what is their internet like? I understand it is provided by Lumos which has a far better google review score than Single Digits does, which gives me some confidence. Is the internet consistent? What are the average download speeds? Are there ethernet ports available in the apartments? Any info on the Wi-Fi situation there will be greatly appreciated! (I'm signed up for The Altitude II btw, the new apartments being built next to the original ones)",

Usually is pretty good havent run into many issues with it barring once where lumos needing to replace the router, happened the other week, cuz our internet would drop for a minute at a time. otherwise very good.",

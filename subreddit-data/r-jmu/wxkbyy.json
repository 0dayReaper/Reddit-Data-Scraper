I have taken courses in isat, geology, and geography by being in the geography program and I love it.",

Add in a Comp Sci Major/Minor to have much wider range of job options in GIS when you graduate. That\u2019s a big mistake of most AGIS students is not doing a technical minor.\n\nIf you\u2019re in for the social sciences aspect, once again you should minor in something job-getting and expanding like environmental science (to work at gov agencies for example)",

It was not easy, there is a lot of reading and I had to write many papers, but I wouldn\u2019t say it was hard either. There are many interesting classes in either concentration and you won\u2019t regret it if you decide to go forward with it!",

I myself was left with a lot of empty promises of professors who said they could help with resume stuff and internships so I personally don\u2019t care much for the department. I\u2019m simply just too far in to switch out and I\u2019d make sure you really want to go into geography for the enjoyment of the subject and not just because you don\u2019t know what else to take",

It would be so nice to drag yourself out of the lab at 4am, across the lawn, and into your dorm instead of having to worry about getting across campus.",

The ICS Bus is weird on its timeliness but you\u2019ll get the hang of it. The hill kinda sucks but it\u2019s like a 10min walk to Walmart and 5mins to Sheets. And festival and EHall are right there. Can\u2019t recommend Doah enougj",

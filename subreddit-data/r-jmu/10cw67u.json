    "postText": "I am currently enrolled in Math 220 with Beth Cochran (who is one of only a few math professors with a good RateMyProfessor score), but I was wondering if Math 229 would be a better / easier class for me. I am a Computer Science major, so I have experience in a few different programming languages, and maybe R would be a good addition to my arsenal. Any thoughts on this? Would it be better to go with a good professor or something more in line with my major?",

            "comment": "This isn\u2019t much of an answer to your question but Cochran is an AMAZING prof. I had her last year and I am not good at math at all and need professors that are good at explaining things and she was the best. Made it very easy as she broke it down step by step and usually once a week gave practice problems for you to do with classmates in class to make sure you understand what you\u2019re doing. Highly recommend her",

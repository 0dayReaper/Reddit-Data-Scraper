    "postText": "Sorry if this is a stupid question. I am a freshman and I thought I heard (from my mom, who checks jmu parent boards) that you get 3 meal punches a week? However the jmu website says 3 punches a day. \n\nIf you get 3 punches a day, how do you guys get your money's worth? I don't have a fridge (yet) and I don't see a use in getting like 9 bags of chips every day. I definitely won't get all-access plus in the future, but if any of you have 11-swipe I'd love to hear your experience (like if you stress at all about not having enough punches/$s, etc.) Thanks so much!",

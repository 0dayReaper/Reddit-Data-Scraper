    "postText": "JMU's website says the requirement is \"one full year beyond Algebra II in a course for which Algebra II is a prerequisite\", does this mean that I have to take one more math to even apply to JMU?\n\nI took Algebra II last year, and have technically finished all my math credits for my high school degree, but if this means that I have to take 1 more math class to apply to JMU, I have no problem with that.\n\nThanks.",

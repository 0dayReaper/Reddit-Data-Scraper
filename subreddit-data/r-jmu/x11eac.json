I mean, news and opinion, especially an opinion writer needs to, you know, write stuff using their imagination etc. all the time on a whim. \n\nTry this, you\u2019re hired! Congratulations and welcome to The Breeze! You\u2019re first piece is titled \u201cWhy I wanted to become an opinion writer\u201d.  It\u2019s due for print by midnight tonight. We expect you to be done by then or our readers will be disappointed. \n\nNo joke you\u2019re deadline is in 3.5h from now and I want to review.\n\nEdit:  You\u2019re fired.",

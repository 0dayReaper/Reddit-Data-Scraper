Partying or not people will still be going to grocery stores, appointments, seeing family, have roomates they can't control, going to work, there are plenty of legitimate and unavoidable reasons people have contact with off campus people. You can't keep an imaginary 20,000+ person bubble going.",

Any party of 50 or greater will get us all kicked off campus so anything we can do to stop us from all leaving would be good. I, like many others, will be ratting out parties at any chance we get, so don\u2019t party :)",

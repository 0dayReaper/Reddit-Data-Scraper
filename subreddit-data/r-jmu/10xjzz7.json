Reasons include not meeting GPA requirement, possible past policy issues that involved going to OSARP, extreme roommate conflicts, and not being a good fit for the job \n4) selection criteria is pretty vague/simple. Can you be a good leader/role model, can you balance work and personal life, are you capable of handling the mental load that being an RA can bring (resident mental health issues, roommate conflicts,etc)\n\nhttps://www.jmu.edu/orl/employment/employment-hub/become-an-ra.shtml\n\n^ ResLife website with more info\n\nI\u2019m a current RA and gonna be one again next year. I like it a lot but it can be hard sometimes just like any job! Def consider applying :)",

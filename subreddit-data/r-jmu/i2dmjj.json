Well the person wrote the pass for May of 2014 through late August of 2015, instead of August of 2014.\n\nI had a parking pass decal on my car from the previous year.  So there were a few times I saw parking services looking at that, seeing the temporary pass, and leaving in defeat.  I got a couple of tickets, which i successfully protested and was able to keep the pass as I had proof of being a paid employee of the university (as in, paid by JMU, not Aramark or something) while I was a student.\n\nIt brought me so much joy.",

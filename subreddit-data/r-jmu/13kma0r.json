    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m a upcoming freshman majoring in Cs. Math has never been my strength but I recently took the aleks placement exam and scored a 56 which puts me barely in to be able to take Math 231 which is required for Cs. How hard was the class for you guys and was there any professors I should avoid or some I should try getting into? Thank you",

There\u2019s a bunch of free resources like khan academy, Paul\u2019s online notes, etc.  just put in the time and you\u2019ll be fine.",

Tests were more than fair (ALL of his tests were open note). 231 was a piece of cake, I think I ended with an A. 232 was a bit more challenging, and I also didn\u2019t divert as much time to it as I did 231. I ended 232 with a B-. \n\nBlosser does have a fair amount of homework, but none of it is extremely difficult. Also, the notes that he posts on canvas are super helpful.",

(Also just had Cochran for Stats) As long as you don't get in the habit of just \"winging\" exams and actually study for things, you'll be fine. If you don't want to rip your hair out at the lack of a professor's teaching abilities, avoid O'Shea for sure. Woodruff is really good and actually puts in the effort to help students who ask. Same goes for Cochran but I found Stats 220 to be pretty easy overall. Either way best of luck!",

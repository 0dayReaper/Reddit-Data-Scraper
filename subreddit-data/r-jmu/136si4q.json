    "postText": "For dorms, I\u2019m trying to be close to my classes (I\u2019m undecided) and I want close access to the library (Rose seems better since carrier is under construction). I\u2019m interest towards business or intelligence analysis, so it would be ideal if I can be near those classes. I heard IA is in east campus and business is closed to the village. I\u2019m also a first year, so maybe it would be nice being near my gen-Ed classes. What would you all suggest?",

            "comment": "General overview of the dorms you suggested: \n\n* Village is closest to the College of Business and is in the center of everything but Village is known for being party central on weekends. If your not into parties you won't enjoy living there\n* Since as a Freshman you'll be taking a lot of gen-ed classes living in Bluestone isn't a bad idea since your right next to all of your gen-eds and your relatively close to D-Hall\n* East Campus dorms are the nicest dorms and are close to the IA department and Rose but those dorms are hard to get into",

            "comment": "Regardless what you chose to get you will have to spend over a thousand dollars on a computer for college. A $300 laptop is not going to last all 4 years of collage and is going to suck to use.\n\nHere is a animation explaining how to pick a computer [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRY1jrIDhvU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRY1jrIDhvU)\n\nThe main things to look for:\n\n* RAM (More is better): 16GB minimum 32GB recommended. If you go higher than 64GB you will NOT see almost no benefit. If you plan on doing digital art with something like a Wacom Tablet then more ram will be of benefit to you.\n* CPU (More cores are better but this is less important to your workloads than RAM): Minimum 4 cores. More cores are recommended. Intel CPUs have better single thread performance than AMD (One core doing one task, mostly legacy apps). AMD CPUs are much cheaper per core which allows for them to have much higher core counts for the same cost resulting in much better multi thread performance than Intel (Most modern apps, especially creative apps like Adobe CS). Apple uses ARM CPUs in some of their newer products, these have much better energy efficiency at the cost of not being able to run X86 programs very well if at all.\n* GPU (This is harder because GPUs are each like a mini computer just for rendering). Nvidia GPUs do better for GPU compute (Adobe CS and other software uses this for some tasks). AMD GPUs give you more bang for your buck. GPUs are also used if you are playing games. I recommend you look up comparisons on the GPU in any protentional computer. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 are both very good GPUs that are overkill for your use unless you are going deep into digital and 3D art. If you are not doing digital art then you would be find going with a computer with a intergraded GPU (Radeon integrated is one of the better integrated GPU lines).\n\nLook for Laptops that use USB-C or Thunderbolt for charging. Some of the more powerful computers will not be able to charge over USB-C or Thunderbolt but if the computer does not have a overkill GPU in (RTX 3070) it then should use USB-C to charge or it is a garbage computer. All of the non-MagSafe MacBook's use USB-C to charge. If you computer can charge with USB-C this means you can use the same charger as a modern non-apple phone to charge the computer. This only works with the more powerful higher wattage chargers (fast chargers) but this makes it much easer for you to get and borrow chargers. This also allows you to get something like a USB-C powerbank to charge the computer.",

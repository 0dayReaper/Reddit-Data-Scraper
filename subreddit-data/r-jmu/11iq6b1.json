    "postText": "Recently got interested in the music production minor so I'm currently looking into the requirements for it. There's only three professors that are each the only option for the required classes, and I'm not seeing good reviews on rmp. I mean you shouldn't trust everything on rmp but usually they have legitimate reviews so... Are the three professors that bad? How hard are the classes? Would it be worth it to do a mui minor at jmu",

            "comment": "I started out as a music major, concentration in music industry (dual major with business). After a year of that, I said screw this and dropped the major down to the mui minor. After one more semester, I dropped that.\n\nWhat exactly are you hoping to do with the minor? If it\u2019s recording, there are a million ways to just learn that stuff on your own. \n\nAs for the professors, I quit mui back in 2011ish and Cottrell, Ojo Taylor, and Mickey Glago were there. Cottrell was a total dick. I remember in his second mui class, he had the class do a virtual interview with his buddy named Chris Mangum. At the end, Chris gave us his email, which was something like chrismangum43@gmail.com. Fast forward to the final, and one of the questions was, I shit you not:\n\nWhat was the email address of the person who gave a guest lecture?\n\nA) chrismangum34@gmail.com\n\nB) chrismangum43@gmail.com\n\nC) chrismagnum34@gmail.com\n\nD) chrismagnum43@gmail.com\n\nI\u2019ve never been so angry at a professor during a test. Ojo was nice and fairly chill, but I don\u2019t think I learned anything useful. I don\u2019t think I took any classes with Mickey. \n\nNow, I will give them credit for the fact that the three of them know a lot about the industry, and Cottrell especially has great connections. But it\u2019s not worth the time and money, IMO.",

Absolutely an ego driven question and has no educational value.\n\nI had Ojo for a semester. The only qualms I had with him is that he posted everything as a discussion on canvas and it was the students\u2019 faults for not realizing\u2026 even though it\u2019s the exact opposite of what any other professor does. His test content also had a good amount of trick questions or \u201cfill in the quote\u201d type of questions that didn\u2019t really add to my education.",

            "comment": "I graduated with an MUI minor in 2020 and thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nI had Cottrell for the intro class, audio devices, and another class about sound design. He definitely expects a lot out of his students and will call you out if you're slacking, but if you do the assignments and actually pay attention in class you'll have no problems with him. I also had him as my advisor for an independent study my senior year where it was really interesting learning about his background and hearing his insight from his years of experience while I was tasked with recording a local band.\n\nI had Ojo for Legal Aspects and loved that class, though I may be biased because I really enjoyed learning about the legal side of the industry in general. I don't remember it being a particularly challenging class and he was a pretty fun professor.\n\nI had Mickey for Multitrack and a class on live recording/mixing. He's a really fun professor and if you're interested in studio work his Multitrack class is prob a must if you're taking the minor. I also TA'd for his Multitrack class if that gives you any idea about how I liked him as a professor and someone to work with.\n\nOverall, it's a neat minor that I definitely learned a lot from and would say definitely do it if you're interested. Don't let RMP be the deciding factor for the minor.",

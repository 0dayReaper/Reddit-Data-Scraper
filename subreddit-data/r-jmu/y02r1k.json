But think about this - you have absolutely nothing to market yourself and set yourself apart from the thousands of applications that are going to be full of people who spent their time doing extra curricular activities and excelling in school. Why would they want to accept an application from someone who is not demonstrating that they will contribute to not only the academic environment, but the social environment as well. Basically all you\u2019ve got (based on your post) is just a 2.9 GPA. If you\u2019re serious about going to a 4 year traditional college you should take a year off and pursue extra curricular and try to improve your social resume.",

The same can be said about varsity sports, even if you aren't trying to play in college. \n\nStudent government can be good to have, if you actually had a significant role and contributed. Clubs are harder to make stand out, especially if they're casual and don't do a lot of things.\n\nIt's true that having a plethora of one-off service events is mostly useless. It's far better to join an established organization and do regular work with them.\n\nMarching band is probably one of the top non-sport extracurriculars since students often pour 100-200 hours into it each fall. \n\nTheater/musical students also put in a plethora of hours in the run up to showtime.\n\nMost universities are SAT optional, and even if they take your score, unless it's really high, it won't make a difference. It's not nearly as important as it was 5 years ago.",

JMU is not that hard especially out of state. if you are in state or struggling, i would recommend putting some dumb extra curriculars on there. like helped the elderly (help your grandparents and their friends), helped my neighbors (talk to your parents friends) even just anything to get you ahead. You are in a tough spot, but personally I believe. Finish strong, work on your SAT (khan academy def helps, if not many other programs look up sat prep on google and bam), maybe take the ACT you could do better who knows\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. If you love JMU so much do the work and you got this. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re a senior in high school so you still have time. Look at it with a positive mindset and work hard and i believe. If god forbid it doesn\u2019t work out, make community college your bitch and you will be good to go in a year/ 2 years. Those who really love this school and WANT it, make it here. So WANT it and work and hard and you got it. Feel free to reach out if you need any help!!! from your favorite december 2022 graduate :)",

Many schools are test optional, JMU being one of them.\n\nUnless you can get a 1400+, taking the SAT probably won't make any difference to your chances.\n\nPutting dumb extracurriculars won't help either. Admissions counselors can pretty easily spot things where you didn't put real time or effort.\n\nPerforming arts and varsity sports are the two best extracurriculars you can have. The marching band and football team put in *hundreds* of hours during each fall season. \n\n\"Helping the elderly\" for a few hours one weekend isn't worth much at all. If you want to list service as an extracurricular, it'll have to be a regular, long term commitment, ideally with an established service organization.\n\nAdmissions counselors aren't idiots. They can tell when someone is BSing their application. You need significant time commitment, demonstration of excellence, or a leadership role to have a good extracurricular on your application.",

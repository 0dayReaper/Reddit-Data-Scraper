            "comment": "I took it with Reidenbach last summer. It\u2019s definitely tougher because it\u2019s 4 weeks, but not impossible. You will have to dedicate a lot of time to it though. The tests are easier since it\u2019s all online, and I believe they were designed to be open note. About 80% of the students in my class were retaking, but I took it for my first time over summer and got an A. \n\nIt\u2019s very time consuming - every day, you have to do a pre-lecture, homework, and optional (DO IT!!) extra credit assignment through smart book, which are so boring. For me, it was worth it, because I got an A and it let me take 300 early. \n\nJust curious - why are you choosing summer? To get ahead or are you behind? I did it after my freshman year and id recommend everyone to take 241 asap and take 300 on spring of their sophomore year",

    "postText": "Hey JMU, what's going on?  \nI'm going to be coming into your neck of the woods tomorrow for a debate tournament and I was wondering what I should do on Friday night? If someone wants to adopt me into their shenanigans that would be pretty neat, but I'm also down to go do stuff solo if people can give me a hint of where to go/what to see.   \n\n\nI'm pretty open-minded about what I should do - I'm assuming that most of what there is to do on Friday night is bars. Generally, I like to dance, but if there's also a cool spot where people are just hanging out, that's also great. Thanks in advance and hope to catch y'all tomorrow night &lt;3",

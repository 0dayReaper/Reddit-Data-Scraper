            "comment": "300 is definitely a grind - I\u2019d recommend to not do fin360 and band at the same time (obviously not saying to quit band). You\u2019ll be totally fine to push off fin360 into the spring, especially if you have some geneds left, and you can take your BLAW/other elective in the spring. Senior year will be a grind unfortunately, and idk how much marching band really is, but it definitely won\u2019t be a cakewalk to balance everything \n\nI\u2019d recommend enrolling in Fin360 to start, look into the material whenever the class opens, and get a better feel for the class and if you think you can manage that.",

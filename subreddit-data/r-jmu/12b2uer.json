Upon completion, I will have 25 credits. currently, i have a 3.2 gpa and am wondering if you need to take every class that is listed. I have completed one of the political science classes (A) are my chances low if i don\u2019t have the other 2?",

            "comment": "I was a transfer student  from community, so you basically have two options. Both options have pros and cons.  \n\nIf you transfer with just one year from community you will have the benefit of getting to know what 4 year courses are like and also it will be easier to have a normal social group.  After I did my two years I noticed it was hard to have a social group because everyone has already gone through half of college with each other etc. I also I noticed the expectations for course work is a lot higher than community college which was rough figuring that out.\n\nThe drawback of transferring with just a year from community is that you\u2019ll be spending a lot more money. At community my per credit tuition rate was like 160$ at JMU I think it\u2019s like 450$ - 500$ per credit. Another drawback is you will most likely have to do clusters for their gen Eds requirements. A lot of gen ed classes are jam packed like sardine style  like elbow to elbow in an auditorium.\n\nThe benefit to doing your two years a community is that it\u2019s really cheap compared to 4 year prices. Also class sizes are small. Another benefit is that you can get a feel for college without immediately racking up  crazy debt just in case it\u2019s not the path you want to pursue.\n\nSide note about work ethic expectations at a 4 year. When I was taking linear algebra at community I felt pretty good. The hw problems weren\u2019t so bad and the exams weren\u2019t outside of the norm. The expectation was can you get the right answer at the end of your calculation. At JMU the math classes and professors aren\u2019t so cut and dry. They really make you think and the problems aren\u2019t just do the calculation. You could get the right answer to a problem but if you messed up a intermediate step, forgot to use certain notation, or used the wrong terminology in your explanation you\u2019ll lose points.  Also another difference is when I took math classes at community I\u2019m pretty sure you could have simple calculator (not a graphing calculator) and some professor gave you  formula sheets. At JMU don\u2019t expect that, I had a 120 flash cards full of theorems and formulas that we had to memorize for calc3  cause you weren\u2019t getting a formula sheet for the exams.\n\nSo study hard and don\u2019t drop your guard and brush up on your stuff b4 transferring. Also the humanities classes here aren\u2019t no joke either.\n\nBest of luck in your endeavors",

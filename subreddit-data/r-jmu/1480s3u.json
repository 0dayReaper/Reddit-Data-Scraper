    "postText": "I want to make this post to see if anyone else is experiencing this or has any solutions because I doubt I'm the only one. The title sums it up, I can more or less only use basic office applications. I'll do my best to keep this post concise but I am incredibly defeated at the moment even after contacting Help Desk.\n\nA few of my main issues:\n\n* The vast majority of critical files stored in my computer under the OneDrive folder (automatically uploaded to the cloud from my files via the OneDrive app) are now exclusively online after being deleted (downloads in a zip folder that cannot be extracted)\n* All OneNote notebooks created beforehand are available only online and are missing significant amounts of information\\*\n* Outlook desktop does not seem to exist and cannot be downloaded (uninstalled and reinstalled office, no change)\n* As a cherry on top, *task manager* and *power options* are blocked by admin. Troubleshooting has led to only dead ends\n\nI have spent countless hours doing my best to up safeguards for this type of situation over the years, if anyone has been able to resolve any of these please reply to spread the knowledge.\n\n\\*Side note: If anyone is considering using their JMU account in OneNote, your notes will be locked into the cloud (download blocked by admin) and will be deleted when your account is deactivated. This is not part of the migration but an important piece of information that was not clear to me",

They wouldn\u2019t help me with the name of the service or give me any advice but kept telling me I would be able to do it myself with google. I tried for DAYS to download it and everything kept coming back saying admin had restricted access. If I had known about this 4 years ago when I started using one note I would\u2019ve never used it.",

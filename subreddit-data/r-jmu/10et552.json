            "comment": "A related point to consider: Be sure to put down your admissions deposit asap. That will give you a better chance to get one of your top dorm preferences. Whichever roommate puts their deposit down first will determine when your group chooses.  Good luck on finding a good match. Plenty of time. Facebook, IG, asking around to see who in your area might have also been admitted, upcoming events like \"Choices\" or random matching are ways most people find their roommates.",

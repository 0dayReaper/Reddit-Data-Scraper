    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am mostly done with my SMAD admissions essays. However, I am struggling with how formal they should be. I want to be professional, but since SMAD is about storytelling, I want to make sure I get enough imagery and narrative in there. Right now, I am writing it to around the same degree as my college application essay. The first paragraph is hook/love for media, and the rest goes more into my credentials and future plans. Those accepted into SMAD, how formal was your essay? I appreciate all the help, and thanks so much!",

I also included some future plans and other background info about myself. it wasn\u2019t necessarily formal like i was writing a research essay but i made sure it still had structure and purpose if that makes sense. I\u2019d also be happy to read it and give some feedback!",

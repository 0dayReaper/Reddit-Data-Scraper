            "comment": "Listen to your advisor - they are literally paid to know about these things, and Reddit is not. Because of the way JMU's COB is accredited, they cannot accept transfer credit from community colleges for certain courses. You must take those courses through JMU or a similarly-accredited university.",

Other people I know took 241 thru LSU, Miss State, and more, but southern schools are by far cheaper than jmu. I believe you can enroll as a non-degree seeking student and you won\u2019t have too much trouble, you may have to apply and mark that you\u2019re non-degree and it\u2019s easier to be accepted",

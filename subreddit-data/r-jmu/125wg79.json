            "comment": "Hi! I went to Maggie and I go to JMU now! The transition was so easy mostly because Maggie was so much harder than this. The workload is a breeze and professors expect a lot less from you here than Maggie\u2019s teachers. And there\u2019s not really competition here like at Maggie. I\u2019m majoring in elementary education and chose JMU because the education program is really good. I also finished with around a 4.25 gpa at Maggie if that gives any type of scale to the level of student I was. As far as I know this is a consensus from all of the Maggie people that I know that go here. Lmk if you have anymore questions!",

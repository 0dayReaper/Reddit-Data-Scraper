(my roommate committed after me) If not what other dorms are good? \n\nBtw we don't want to live in the Village.",

However, next year there is going to be an extra bluestone dorm for freshman, so you have a pretty decent chance. If you want bluestone because you want a suite style you should go to east campus. There are a couple of dorms in Chandler and Chesapeake where you can have a suite style bathroom that a lot of people don\u2019t know about. And Skyline is a good area, I love living on east!!",

There\u2019s so many different groups of people on east. There\u2019s people who do party and ones that don\u2019t, or a nice mixture of both. It\u2019s a 15 minute-ish walk to/from east, and the bus will take you if you don\u2019t feel like walking. E-Hall/Festival/TLC are all right next to you on east to eat at. And I think it\u2019s nice to be away from everything on main sometimes.",

    "postText": "Hello all, \n\nAs the title says, I'm considering switching from CIS to CS, and I'm curious about how behind I would be, and what I should know before going into the CS program. Currently in my second semester as a freshman, so most of the classes I've taken thus far have been GenEds, but I haven't taken any programming classes in the past. If anyone has any advice on how I should go about this and what to expect, that would be great. Thanks in advance.",

Here's the \"Sophomore Start\" curriculum plan: [https://www.jmu.edu/cise/cs/academics/undergraduate/curriculum/149-third-semester.shtml](https://www.jmu.edu/cise/cs/academics/undergraduate/curriculum/149-third-semester.shtml)  \nA lot of students find our major late and can complete it on time and without taking a bunch of CS courses in one semester (I advise the maximum is 3 CS classes - that's what most students find manageable). If you want to keep some CIS in your life, you could do the CIS minor with the CS major.\n2. The first class in the major, CS 149, is designed for no prior programming experience, so it's fine that you haven't taken programming courses before. But the class moves fast and is challenging, so I highly recommend going to our CS TA hours and meeting with your prof during office hours. \n\nFeel free to set up a time for us to talk if you want to come up with a plan for your path through the CS curriculum, especially talking about some considerations when you take CS 240 and CS 261: https://www.jmu.edu/cise/people/faculty/normand-paige.shtml",

However, i switched from engineering my sophomore year to CS and if I hadn't messed up a few classes, I could have graduated on time or with one extra semester. Especially as a freshman, most classes are GenEd anyway, which are required regardless. I think you won't be behind if you switch. Also, I never had any programming classes before switching majors.",

My reason for potentially wanting to switch is that I am more interested in the technical route (Software engineering/development) than I am the analytical route (Business analytics). From my research, this is not to say you cannot go one route with the other major, but I feel as if getting more experience in the CS curriculum would be very beneficial for me. Also, I am still very much on the fence about switching, because both majors seem to provide great career outcomes.",

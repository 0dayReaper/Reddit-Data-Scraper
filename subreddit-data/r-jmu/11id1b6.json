My parents advised me to, however, insisting it was a good school. I was familiar with the party scene and the Greek life prior to going and was worried, but I went in with an open mind and was excited to start somewhere fresh. Flash forward to now, I have made zero friends and I spend my days going to class, studying, occasionally working at cfa (applied to use some of my many hours of free time wisely) and am now getting ready to transfer to Mary Washington in Fredericksburg. I know I'm in the minority, and I know there are probably other opportunities I missed, but I tried my damndest to fit in here and I couldn't. I feel like most people who go here are very similar and I would have had to change my personality to get people to like me. I did not want to do that just for the sake of making friends. While I do believe JMU is still a good freshman pick for most, I can't see myself spending the next 3 years here.",

    "postText": "Someone told me a certain bus stops at CVS but I ended up getting dropped off at the wrong CVS (which is 40 mins by foot from the one I want to go to)... I looked on the route 3 bus schedule and the CVS at MLK Way is mentioned but I don't know if it actually stops there? I've only had bad experiences with buses stopping at that CVS, they either skip it entirely or go to the wrong one, so. :/ Curious if anyone has tried.",

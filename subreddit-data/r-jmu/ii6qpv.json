I wonder if there\u2019s a website or an archiving type of place we can upload, with the date, to show what is actually going on.\n\nHowever, I do have a concern about this which is the faculty getting into trouble for doing the best they can. I have a lecture in Madison union where the available chairs for sitting are only 3 feet spaced out, and I wouldn\u2019t want that to fall on the Professor for something out of their control.",

Once a post is negative, it makes people feel more comfortable downvoting it themselves, driving it down even further.\n\nMore specifically to this subreddit, anything that doesn't subscribe to the doomer mentality that the JMU administration is a bunch of corrupt bastards who are going to take your money, close the campus, and then blame the students for the whole situation tends to get downvoted heavily. I admit that as someone who graduated 17 years ago, I'm probably a bit older than most people on this subreddit, and have been out of the JMU bubble for a while. I've also taken a very dim view of many of the official reactions to this pandemic that we find ourselves in, and believe that the response will ultimately go down in history as a massive blunder. It's a shame how much people aren't willing to hear out other perspectives on here and actually have a reasoned discussion.",

As a student, one expects all of their submitted work to be their best effort possible in order to receive the highest score possible. I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve taken tests thinking that you definitely got an A but when it was returned, the grade was something lower than you expected like a C or D. \n\nIf the professor was grading assignments in a timely manner, then I could make adjustments if I received a low score on something. The problem with professors not grading assignments is that they\u2019ll upload everything towards the end of the semester when it\u2019s too late to try and save your grade/get tutoring.",

People are horrible about writing grades at JMU. None of the professors marked as harsh graders ever are, it\u2019s astounding what people turn in at the college level.",

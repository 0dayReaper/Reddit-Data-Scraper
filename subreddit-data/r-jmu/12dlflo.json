There are more dorms in the Bluestone Areas and Hillside are kind of on their own end of campus, but still pretty close. I lived in the Bluestone dorms as a freshmen and sophomore and found them to be very convenient to most things I need those years. Urec and East campus are a bit of a trek from both.",

It\u2019s super close to most of the academic buildings and to D-hall (main campus\u2019s dining hall) Should only be around 5-10 minute walk. It\u2019s around a 15 minute walk to east campus\n\nHillside sits on the edge of campus meaning it\u2019s around the same 10-15 minute walk to get to the busy part of main campus or onto east campus. It\u2019s very close to the student success center, and the student Union where you pickup mail. \n\nCampus has two parts cut in two by the highway. East is on one side and Main campus is on the other. There\u2019s a tunnel and a bridge most people use to get between them. It\u2019s not very hard to get from one side to another.\n\nMain campus has most of the Gen Ed classes and a good chunk of the more traditional majors. Education, Math, Business, Art, Psychology, History, Writing, Music, and Communication are mostly on main. Main also has the student success center and the student Union where most of the campus resources are housed. It\u2019s also bigger and a lot older then east. Despite this a lot of it has been renovated so you can\u2019t really tell. Carrier library is on this side of campus.\n\nEast campus is where most of the STEM major classes are held including stuff like Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Engineering, Geoscience, Computer Science, ISAT, etc. This side of campus has \u201cFestival\u201d a big conference center/dining area and the convocation center where they hold graduation and basketball games. Rose Library is on this side of campus.\n\nUrec is smack dab in the middle of campus. It\u2019s right through \u201cDuke tunnel\u201d which goes under the highway. You can also cross the bridge to east campus and make a right. It\u2019s technically on east campus but it\u2019s wedged right up against the highway so it\u2019s still equidistant from both halves.",

Getting to main is a bit of a walk, maybe around 20 minutes on foot but it\u2019s almost completely downhill. Urec is equidistant from both dorms. Skyline is a ways from the student Union and the student success center but if you plan right you can hit those locations when you\u2019ve got class on main if you need to.\n\nHillside is alright but the buildings are a lot older. It would be less if a walk home but it\u2019s still a ways from the biology building. It\u2019s also a descent uphill climb to get to east. Not fun when you\u2019re late for class.",

McGraw is smack in the middle and you are a quick walk to the dining hall and the quad, but also by walking through the back parking lot and over the train tracks you cross the bridge to east and all your major classes are there. Also don\u2019t underestimate the bus, I use it all the time as there is a stop right outside hillside hall, and one at the bottom of the hill at d hall. Good luck though!",

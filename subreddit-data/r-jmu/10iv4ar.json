If you end up on main, Logan hall, Hoffman hall, and the hillside area are all really nice dorms that are close to the main campus classes.",

Not all dorms have air conditioning, specifically the village doesn\u2019t. If it\u2019s suite style you have 3 roommates but if it\u2019s hall style you only have 1 roommate. I\u2019m a biotech major and lived in Chesapeake and jennings.",

            "comment": "Oh lord here we go again. So: it really depends on what you want to prioritize. Do you want somewhere that is central to the university? The Village/Hillside area. Do you want a new building? Skyline. Do you want more a private bathroom? Bluestone. Each building has their own perks and downsides too. The Village may be central, but doesn\u2019t have AC in the rooms and\u2026 respectfully the buildings are a little worn down to put it nicely. The Bluestone area has those nice more private bathrooms, but it may not being the closest to everything depending on your class schedule and also doesn\u2019t have the easiest way to make friends (not that it\u2019s too difficult at JMU). Skyline has nice quality rooms and feel very clean, but are very distant from campus excluding the science buildings and e-hall.\n\nI would also say don\u2019t pick dorms based on your major. \n\nI lived in Bell (Hillside Area) my first year and while it wasn\u2019t what I wanted at the time, I still had a great experience and was able to make friends that have lasted me all the way through JMU.\n\nAs an RA I have lived in Gifford (Bluestone) and Shenandoah (Skyline) and as a Hall Director I live in Harper Allen-Lee. If you have questions or details that you want, you can definitely refer to the Residence Life website or you can message me if you want!\n\nHope this helps and welcome to JMU :)",

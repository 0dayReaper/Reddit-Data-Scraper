I can tell you straight up if you are JUST looking for a place to live, The Harrison is not a bad choice. The only thing is there is no ceiling light in the bedrooms. Just like most student apartments in Harrisonburg, the construction sucks and sometimes it can be pretty loud if you don\u2019t like loud noises like loud music or stomping footsteps.",

The leasing office crew was awesome, maintenance people were pretty quick to respond to any issues, and there was a lot of space in the apartments. Location was great too! Spent soooo much time at the pool. Would highly recommend looking into it if you broaden your search.",

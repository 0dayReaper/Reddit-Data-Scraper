I did that and it was time consuming but I didn\u2019t get below an 8 or 9 after I switched to writing literally every vocab word down.",

Mind you, this was pre-COVID so her way of teaching might be different.\n\nMy suggestion is to read the book and take notes and write down the things that she says, not what's really on the slide.",

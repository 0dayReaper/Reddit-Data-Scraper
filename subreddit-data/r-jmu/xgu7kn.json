It's supposed to have a top-golf-esque scorekeeping system.\n\nGo skeet shooting at Flying Rabbit.\n\nGo see something at Court Square Theater or the Shakespeare Center in Staunton.\n\nGo to an art show opening.\n\nGo to a pumpkin patch or other you-pick farm.\n\nGo kayaking or tubing, there are a bunch of different places within 40 mins or so.",

It looked like a generic hole in the wall place back in the day but the vermicelli bowls were everything.",

This serious increase in violent crime in that specific area really needs to be looked at. Back about 15 years it was just party central with the small criminal activity that goes along with that. But shootings are complete ridiculous and HPD needs to stop fucking around with kind of glossing over JMU hubs as just college kids being college kids. Not saying JMU students were the shooters obviously. But renaming Ashby to the Harrison isn\u2019t actually doing shit for that area.",

All units in that row except for 1 were occupied by students except the last one next to mine, it was occupied by some SKETCHY townies. Well that year they had a Halloween party and invited us over, but we were having our own party a few houses down so only my 2 roommates went to check it out. It was a big party but it was all 30+ year old black and Hispanic people (not an issue, but obviously JMU feels mostly white so it was clear this was not a JMU party). All their drinks had a cost: $1 for keg beer, $2 for a shot, or $3 for the \u201cmagic drink\u201d which contained god knows what drugs. \n\nAt some point in the party, a guy went berserk and just started sucker punching people in the face, I think about 10 people. Literally if you made eye contact with him he would just storm up to you and knock you out. He did this in the parking lot on his way out as well and a guy I know had his jaw wired shut for a few months because of it, and literally had no interaction with the guy beforehand. \n\nTo top the night off, a guy was carrying a passed out girl on his shoulder through the party trying to leave (not rescuing her, the exact opposite). Out front, there was a huge crowd of people and instead of just going around the crowd, he wanted to go right through but people wouldn\u2019t move, so he just took out his gun and fired a few shots into the air which obviously scattered everyone.\n\nPolice immediately swarmed the place like a swat team, with dogs and everything while our party a few houses down had to squeeze everyone inside and just wait. \n\nBy far the sketchiest thing that happened on Devon in the 3 years I lived there.",

            "comment": "We tried to do this when I lived in Bluestone and generally the answer is no - your friends would have to have the same or similar housing slots to you because the rooms around you will fill up and they might not even get into the same building as you. So there isn\u2019t an official way to reserve rooms or anything - you\u2019d just have to hope for the best.",

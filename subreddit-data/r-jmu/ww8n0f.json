            "comment": "You can just put your PO Box address as that is your on campus shipping address (include 800 South Main St. in the address if it\u2019s through UPS or something, or just throw it in just in case) - as long as it\u2019s not like a whole refrigerator or something, you\u2019ll be fine. You have a PO Box for mail,  but packages will go to the mailroom in Madison Union (also where your actual PO Box is if you ever want to check it) and you just pick them up at the package counter. Package arrives, you get an email notification, go to the mailroom, swipe your JACard, and go to the counter when they call out your PO Box number",

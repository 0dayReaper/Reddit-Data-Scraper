    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nSo, I was accepted into JMU in 2021, but I waited an extra year just to be accepted into UVA in the fall of 2022. My goal was to major in CS; however, UVA told me that I transferred in with too many credits and I was forced to change my major to cognitive science with a concentration in computer science. They waited until November to tell me this, which caused my schedule to become terrible because I was now pursuing a major I had no idea about.\n\nAdditionally, the CS department at UVA is terrible. There is a lack of resources for students, inaccurate study guides, and unprofessional conduct. For example, my professor misgraded my final project, even though I had worked very hard on it and exceeded expectations. However, my professor is giving me the run-around regarding fixing his mistake, and I\u2019m tired of the unprofessionalism.\n\nEverything has boiled over, and I have decided to transfer out. Although UVA may be prestigious in certain areas, the CS department is not one of them. What is the process like for transferring to JMU? Also, is the CS department there competent?",

As a female, I feel so supported by the professors and students. Everyone really works together and the whole program itself is just so great. If you transfer you won\u2019t be disappointed",

The problem with JMU is the graduate program for CS is almost non existent when compared to UVA.\n\nFor your undergrad JMU CS is the way to go.",

This may be the best way to get your logistic questions answered and see if CS at JMU is a good fit. Best of luck!",

He's planning to go to NoVa next year to VT satellite campus for his master's. I think he told me if you keep a certain GPA, you can easily xfer after your bachelor's (you are basically accepted automatically, don't quote me on this)\n\nThe CS curriculum is grueling, but it is an environment where the professors are super super nice and help kids develop their soft skills (teaching, assisting professors in research internships, speaking at conferences about their research). My son has developed in so many ways, and he says the teachers, and fellow students are amazingly smart, the professors are kind and he developed really close relationships with the WHOLE JMU faculty in the CS department.\n\nAs a mom, which I never expected, all 3 of my kids are JMU kids. In addition, I have a rising junior at the music school (excellent, so many performances for everyone) and a rising freshman who intends to study education).\n\nThese all seem like a school within a school and my two dukes know everyone in their dept. CS is on East campus, music on West campus. They didn't see each other often on campus, but got together for concerts and lunch etc. Couldn't be more proud that my daughter chose JMU for next year.

All I heard about in high school four years ago was VT and UVA being the only CS programs, but that is really not the case. The professors really challenge their students here and are super helpful, grade fairly, etc (though like any CS program it is not easy). You will learn a lot from the program and what it offers. The department also does great with offering resources to students such as TA hours and CS student ambassadors, who can talk way more about the department (visit their website). I would highly recommend going to JMU for CS. All my friends and I already have jobs and everything too. Best of luck to you and hope this helps.",

            "comment": "some context: I\u2019m a current JMU student who\u2019s jumped around majors some and settled on Geographic Science one of the like 7 majors along with CS in the college of integrated science and engineering (CISE). This year I have been enrolled in the CS entry courses and have applied to add the CS major, i hear back in a few days. \nIt\u2019s true that I wouldn\u2019t say JMU as a whole is #1 in academic rigor in the state, but I can say that in comparison to other colleges in JMU, CISE is very serious about preparing students for after graduation. It\u2019s separate from the college of math and science so focus on the applied sciences and problem solving and dominates the entire east campus. CISE is super involved beyond the classroom with career fairs, speakers, hosting national competitions, and tech firm meet and greets and things like that and there is also a lot of organizations that use the labs that are focused on integrated sciences. (By all this I mean that a lot of other colleges in JMU kinda felt very traditional to me and CISE felt very live and out of the box. I\u2019d use an analogy of like a traditional 9 to 5 compared to like working at google and all their weird little out of the box things). To finish out talking about CISE I can say the department helped me get a job/internship at a fortune 500 tech company with a security clearance as a sophomore/junior with one of the less in demand majors (GS). More specifically about the CS major: the CS and engineering majors really have extraordinarily high quality resources and professors so they require students with interest complete a year worth of class work and apply because they have a limited number of seats. With this scarcity and competition there is a downside that the schedule of coursework is very rigid and does not have much wiggle room, but technically after the application year the major (not counting gen ed electives) can be completed in 2 years, so applying with credits under your belt would give you a leg up on selecting the best CS classes before more people. With your CS background I suggest you reach out and meet with Paige Normand (just google her name and jmu for contact) over zoom and maybe jmu admissions to find out logistics transferring into the CS program here. In my year of experience with the CS program and my experience jumping around majors and departments I can say that CS has some excellent professors and some really incredible student support. The classes are hard but there are TONS of resources to help you from the best teaching assistant tutor program I\u2019ve seen at JMU to Piazza (an online forum) to just how helpful and willing to work with you the professors are you will always be able to put in the work to earn good grades. In JMU CS, you will also run into the math department a ton. For the classes you need there\u2019s tutoring and resources provided by the school as well (more context I\u2019ve completed a math minor here, which you will be like two classes away from completing if you are in CS here). \nJust about JMU in general I\u2019m not going to go too in depth cause I already wrote like wayyy too much, but I love it here. I also got into UVA and changed my mind because they canceled in-person classes that year but I have never regretted my decision to come here. Sorry I wrote so much and it\u2019s one big ole block of text i don\u2019t use reddit all too often and I just wanted to make sure I could give as much info as I could. Def investigate and make an informed decision but remember that anywhere you go is only limited by you and what you make of it. Best of Luck!",

            "comment": "Heyo just finished this class last week. For my class, we had to create a research proposal in relation to our concentration. Each week you worked on a different part of the proposal and turned in sections for grades and feedback. There is a discussion board portion every week. We each had to lead one of the weeks as the discussion board leader (explain lesson/respond to everyone's posts). At the end, you turned in a final written proposal and gave the professor a 15 minutes presentation on it. Wasn't too bad as long as you could keep on top of the busy work.",

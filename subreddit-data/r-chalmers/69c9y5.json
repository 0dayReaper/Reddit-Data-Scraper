    "postText": "Hello guys, I am an International student and I recently got admitted to Chalmers University in the master's program of Software engineering and technology. I have a couple of questions that I need to clarify. I hope I don't sound naive or noobish but such questions are bugging me a lot. I have searched the internet before hand in case you might be wondering about it.\n\nQ1. Can I get a scholarship if I can produce good grades after the first semester. Is it possible to apply for it if I previously did not avail it?\n\nQ2. International students sometimes have to work to aid their expenses to some extent, if I can learn basic swedish will I be able to get work (odd job) outside of University? Will knowing only English be enough?\n\nQ3. You guys might have come across some international student while at University, how much in average do they need to spend for living and food?\n\nQ.4 How is the learning curve at Chalmers? Are the teachers approachable easily?\n\nThanks in advance..\n\n",

            "comment": "Q2.\nIt's possible to get a job without knowing Swedish. Sweden has a higher fraction of English speakers than Canada. But since English after all isn't a recognized official language, learning Swedish will help a lot, especially since it means you can take written instructions.\n\nQ3.\nI would say that somewhere between 4000-7000 SEK is a reasonable assumption for food and living per month. That's probably what an average student pay, and I can't imagine that those costs would differ for an international student.\n\nQ4. Depends on what you're comparing to. Nationally it's fairly step. The average time of completion for a bachelor and master (5 years) is about 7 years at chalmers, but that could be because Sweden has pretty nice study grants etc for native Swedes. We take two courses in parallel and the masters courses are usually easier than the bachelor courses because the master courses are more interdisciplinary and thus not as deep. Generally there are a lot of group projects and focus on applications and towards industry.\n\nThe teachers are generally very approachable. Sweden doesn't have the social culture of \"formal respect\" between students and professors/lecturers as many other countries have. It's more chillaxed. So it's really easy to just ask them things whenever or swing by their office and knock on the door. Of course, this can differ slightly since not all professors comes from Sweden and have different backgrounds and expectations.\n\nI've had lecturers that have had an attitude of \"I don't care if you sleep or play games on your phone during class, I'm going to assume that you're here because you want to learn and so what ever you think helps you do that is fine, as long as you aren't noisy during lectures\". On the other side of the spectrum I've had lecturers that seems to think that there is some kind of automatic formal social contract between me as a student and him as a professor and that I have to respect him just because he's a professor even if he acted like an inconsiderate, stubborn douche. :) And none of these where native swedes although they've spent a considerable amount of time here. But yea, most of them love when you take an interest in their field by asking questions.",

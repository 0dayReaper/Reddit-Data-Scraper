I have many friends that study at Chalmers and Chalmers have many foreign students. Can\u2019t answer the money &amp; life cuz I\u2019m from GBG and live with my parents. But the weather here is like London it rains a lot so bring your rain coat otherwise good weather.",

            "comment": "Chalmers has a fixed salary rate for PhD students with a fixed yearly increase and also at some checkpoints (i.e. Licientiate degree/ halfway). I think the salary starts at roughly at 32 000 SEK/month (before tax) which is one of the best salaries for PhD students in Sweden. After your PhD degree you could probaly an increase in salary by atleast 10 000 - 20 000 SEK / month.\n\nMore information here: http://www.chalmers.se/en/research/doctoral-programmes/becoming-a-doctoral-student/Pages/default.aspx",

Gothenburg is pretty famous for its rainy and windy weather, but we have had some really good summer the last couple of years.",

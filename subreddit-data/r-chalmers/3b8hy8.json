I need some advice on rotary, the place I've managed to score accommodation at rotary which looks pretty good. One thing seems weird though, the rotary room inventory says no mattress is included. where should I get one? secondhand? Ikea?\n\nAny help on this would be awesome!\n\nThanks,\nJ",

The reason for you to buy your own matress is because it's not considered very fresh to sleep in some other guys body fluids :) What you get is a bed made out of plywood so you will indeed use a self bought matress and your own sheets.\n\nI'd say [JYSK](http://jysk.se/sovrum/madrasser/skummadrasser) is a good choice for getting a matress. They can be found at [Backaplan](https://www.google.se/maps/place/JYSK/@57.7210598,11.9540696,15z/data=!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x464ff4a46309c9af:0xfbb6a7cfa6b4744e!2zU8O2ZHJhIERlbHRhdsOkZ2VuIDMsIDQxNyAwNSBHw7Z0ZWJvcmc!3b1!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x0f9861efc3b398ad!6m1!1e1). JYSK is a low price store for beds and other furniture. You can get there by taking a tram or bus to Hjalmar Brantingsplatsen (tram 10 takes you directly from Chalmers, your nearest tram stop, to Hjalmar Branting)",

    "postText": "What I think sometimes is that:\nIn current generation of engineering almost everything is possible by using softwares, sensors and hydraulics. Making them an integrated system powered by electric energy.\nBut in the past they used to design a system completely mechanical using gears and levers, which did not need extra energy to run, just energy enough to overcome inertia. \nFor example : Differential ( completely mechanical) yet so smart. \n\nBut yes this opinion is biased, but give it a thought \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01",

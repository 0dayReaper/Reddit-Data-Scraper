    "postText": "Hello all. I'm admitted into the MSc. Mobility Engineering with the Avancze scholarship for the fall semester. However, I have also landed a job recently that I'm only lukewarm to. This is the cliche dream vs. reality situation. I don't want to go back to spending daddy's money but I know that the school has a long time strong alliance with Volvo. So here are my questions:\n\n1. How's the job market in general in Sweden? It's astronomically difficult for me to get a job in the States as an international student.\n2. Is there any statistics on the number of people going into automotive industry after graduation?\n3. For those who are/were enrolled, how's your experience? (with faculty, general course/lab/project experience .etc)\n4. Does one need a car to survive the Swedish winter? If so, how expensive it is to own a car in Sweden?\n\nThank you and Cheers!",

I'd rent a car for occasional longer trips across Sweden, but trains are a very viable alternative.  \n\n\nFor reference, I did engineering mathematics, and very much enjoyed the MSc. Have had no issues getting job offers.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I am contemplating pursuing a master\u2019s degree in Sweden. I have a background in business/finance and thus I am well acquainted (or I am trying to) with SSE, Lund, etc.\n\nThe aforementioned program seems quite interesting too. What particularly caught my fancy was the chance to work at a private company (with an assigned mentor) and solve some real life issues. It also looks like that graduates have good employability (and of course there are many taking up entrepreneurship). \n\nAs an international student, my priority is getting a decent job and this is why the private sector involvement part looks like a solid advantage.\n\nAnyway, what do you guys think? Is it a good choice when employability is the main criterion?",

If anyone is interested in AI, with or without any knowledge or experience in the subject, I really recommend this super interesting article by \"Software 2.0\" (meaning AI).  \nIt gave me a great insight on how it developed, how it can be applied and how it might develop in the future! Might give you a competitive edge if you're doing or studying something like this at Chalmers...;)  \nhttps://pub.towardsai.net/software-2-0-b52131f65b68",

    "postText": "Hi guys, I'm moving from Argentina to Gothenburg by July/August to pursue a PhD at Chalmers as part of a WWSC project. How much is an average PhD student salary? Is it enough to cover the basic living costs like renting and so on? I understand that it also depends of the type of funding. I was also put in the housing queue at Chalmers, what about this? Is it cool? In which other sites can I search for housing?  \nThanks in advance",

            "comment": "Doctoral studies are these days (since like 2014 or so) counted not only as \"studies\" per say but as an employment. From what I could gather from this [link](https://www.st.chalmers.se/dokument/lokalt/loneavtal-doktorander-2021-2024) the salary starts around 31000:- (leaving you with around 24000:- after taxes) which is a decent salary by Swedish metrics.\n\nChabo (Chalmers bost\u00e4der)/ [SGS](https://sgs.se/) (other student housing company) got quite a healthy supply of apartments for students (for which you should be eligible afaik). Might be worthwhile signing up for SGS (if anything for the peace of mind) but you should be all set with Chabo alone.\n\nGood luck with your studies and welcome to Gothenburg!",

I chose Engineering mathematics and computational science programme. Right now I am deciding between Systems biology and Linear Statistical Models.  \nWhat do you think about these two courses? Any advice is appreciated!",

            "comment": "System biology with Jens Nielsen? I've taken and completed the course.\n\nI thought it was an interesting course, but it should also be noted that I'm taking the biotechnology master so it's part of my obligatory courses. Although a previous in depth understanding of biochemical pathways isn't necessary for the course, I think it helps and it adds value to the course as a whole. Because in reality all system theory is at its foundation the same.\n\nSystems biology differentiate itself from the foundational concepts of systems theory in that in the cell you have \"currency molecules\" such as ATP/ADP, NADH/NAD, NADPH/NADP that needs to be balanced.\n\nThere are three exercises in the course where two of them requires knowledge in matlab, but it shouldn't be a problem for you judging by your program and other courses. :)\n\nIf there's something else you wonder feel free to ask.",

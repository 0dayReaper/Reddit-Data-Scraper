            "comment": "Hello, I'm on my first year of MPICT. I can give a quick answer.\n\nStudy period 1 \n\nHardest course so far is in this study period - statistical learning in python. Almost half of class failed first exam last year and a whole lot more just barely passed. So brush up on probability to get a head start.\n\n \nIntroduction to com eng\n\nPretty easy course. You'll do a project in this course which at sometime was a headache. (Get 2 headsets to  communicate with each other on physical layer)\n\nStudy period 2\n\nApplied signal processing\n\nVery fun course, no mandatory exam if you complete home assignments and project with good enough grades. So depending if you aim for higher grades or not it will be easier or not.\n\nDigital communications \n\nI didnt like this course, nontheless pretty easy exam if you follow course notes.\n\nStudy period 3\n\nIntro to com networks\n\nJust had this, weird project that took alot of time but pretty ok overall.\n\nJust my quick thoughts, however I would STRONGLY recommend to learn Matlab(if you dont know it already) as this will be used in ALL courses and projects. \n\nShoot me a message if you want more specific answers.",

    "postText": "I am going to Erasmus exchange in less than 3 weeks for one semester but I can't find a place to stay. I registered to SGS and CSB and have 200 days in the queue but it is not enough to get a room. I wouldn't like to share an apartment because of the virus situation and I know that it is difficult to find a place with a bath and kitchen without sharing but any info would be great because I don't have much time left.",

Its used to subletting your apartment, i.e. you get to rent someone's home for a period. It tends to be rather expensive and everything on the site is in swedish, so you will need to do some google translating to get by, but if you dont have a lot of options it could work.",

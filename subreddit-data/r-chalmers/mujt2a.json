I have finished my Bachelors on the computer science track with a laptop from 2013 that was meh when it came out. Most things are done in the browser anyways. \n\nThere's hardly any heavy lifting to be done, but when there is there are hundreds of really beefy computers around campus you can use",

Many students I know are doing totally fine with old laptops. It's not like an expensive computer will actually do anything to help you get through this, that's a thought error.\n\nSure, it's fun to have a nice computer, but new fancy ones are expensive and you've got plenty other things to do with your money. But basically any laptop from the last several years is really really good.\n\nThere are computers on campus and you can also remote into them to use the software. I'm running a mac and linux and just remote access for some windows programs and specialized programs that have expensive licenses.\n\nThe only time I've done actually any heavy processing on a computer of my own was in a course about deep neural networks, but even then I could easily have offloaded that to another computer/cloud if I had wanted. But that was with a \\~5 year old thinkpad and it did great.",

There are plenty of accessible computer labs, and I don\u2019t think we even get access to the most expensive software on our own computers. I also think that the professors are not allowed to force you to use your own computer, since it\u2019s not a requirement for the education. \n\nI mostly use my own computer for browser based things nowadays, and at least for now you can access all computer labs remote too.",

Only exchange students start in januari.\n\nSo if there is a application published it is most likely for the autumn.\n\nAnother tip if you are planning on moving here, start look for and sign up to the ques for housing. Quite difficult city to get an apartment, even if exchange student get extra help in some ways. ",

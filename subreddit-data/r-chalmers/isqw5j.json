My girlfriend is probably going to go at Chalmers for the spring semester in January, but that's pretty stupid we can not find any dates for the semester.\nAnyone has a clue of an approximation of the beginning of the semester ? She is in embedded systems for her last year of Master.\nThanks everyone for the help and god bless Sweden.",

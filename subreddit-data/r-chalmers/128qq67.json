    "postText": "Hello there! Since Chalmers University offered a place in MSc Data Science and AI, I was wondering if anyone here will start the new semester this Autumn 2023. And, for those who are already at the institute, I have a couple questions:\n\n* How  the AI-related course are in general?\n* I have a particular interest in neural networks and gnerative AI. I saw a course about \"Artificial Neural Networks\", can anyone give me an opinion about this course?\n* Finally, if the path convince me enough, my ambition is to pursue a doctorate. I read about research centers also focused in specific areas, like NLP, computer vision and machine learning. How is the environment?\n\nI know they may be too much general questions, and I thank anyone who can reply.",

            "comment": "Hi, I study the second year of the Data Science and AI program. Right now I'm doing my master thesis. I'll try to answer your questions as well as I can\n\n* I think the AI-courses are well structured. Usually they follow the format of having one assignment a week, each assignment involves exploring some new concept such as regression, clustering, reinforcement learning and so on, where the resulting hand in is a Jupyter Notebook. The tasks includes implementing things in python, answering questions, reasoning about your results and summarising relevant papers. The examiner and teacher assistants are always helpful if you get stuck.\n* ANN is a great course from what I have heard, you get to build a neural network from the ground upp without any help from tools such as tensorflow or pytorch. I have not studied it myself, but the teacher is great, the content is great. However, the structure of the course is a bit messy and it is a very challenging course since there is so much to do. But since you are interested in the subject I think you will do just fine \ud83d\ude04\nAny other course you are interested in?\n* I do not know that much about the research environment because I have not been interested in a PhD. All examiners in your courses are also researchers at Chalmers and are eager to share what they are working on if you ask. Chalmers does also have good connections to the industry, so you could do an industrial PhD where you work for a company while doing your PhD. It's also common for master theses to be conducted at a company.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions \ud83d\ude03",

Other than pure curiosity, I also ask to have a first idea of a thesis in the master's degree.\n- Related to NN, I'm attracted to generative AI and NNs from a cognitive system point of view. Are these arguments treated in courses like ANN and Deep Machine Learning (i think these are the most-related courses)?",

                            "comment": "* The thesis is in collaboration with Volvo Autonomous Solutions, its more of an algorithms thesis than Data Science I would say. The project our supervisor is developing is a model based scheduler for fleets of autonomous vehicles, i.e., provided we have a set of vehicles which can drive on their own. How should the vehicles move in order for all vehicles to be optimally utilized. Our job is to prevent the system from deadlocking, i.e., that no vehicles block each other in a circle. If you only look one or a few steps forward, how do you guarantee that you will not end up in deadlock?\n* Since I have (regrettably) not studies any of these course (although I have heard they are good courses), I do not know if the course include generative AI. But here are some links for both the course syllabuses\n\n[Artificial Neural Networks (Canvas Link)](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/19963/assignments/syllabus)\n\n[Cognitive ergonomics](https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/course?course_id=33402)\n\n[Deep Machine Learning](https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/course?course_id=33635)\n\n[Advanced Machine Learning with Neural Networks (Canvas Link)](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/23351/assignments/syllabus)\n\nYou can also search for other course PM:s [here](https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/course_list)\n\nCourses sometimes also have projects as final assignments, which allows you to explore subjects not covered in the course",

I thought it will be better because of the university reputation but i was really disappointed. The course content and group work is not up to the mark. I would honestly prefer going to US or canada to study AI. The job market in sweden for AI is very small currently so you will probably end up jobless for a while.",

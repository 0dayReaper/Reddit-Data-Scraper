    "postText": "Hei. I am a freshly graduated student from Germany. I have a bachelor of science in Biotechnology and would like to study biotechnology aster level) at Chalmers. I checked the application requirements and it demands a lot of math. I only had one math module worth 5 Etcs and several engineering courses.\n\nDO they check the specific entry requirements a lot when applying for the course? Do you have any tips or experiences about it?\n\nHave a nice evening :)",

It would be better to contact the university admissions about it.\n\nAnother recommendation is to contact one of the student ambassadors through the Unibuddy platform. I am sure there might be someone who is doing the Biotechnology program and they can help you better.\n\nGood luck.",

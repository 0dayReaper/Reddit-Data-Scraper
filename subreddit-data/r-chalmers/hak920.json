Like Plan=1 would be ground floor, plan=2 is one flight up, and plan=-1 would be basement...but what does that look like exactly? No windows?\n\nIt took me forever to figure out kokvr\u00e5 vs k\u00f6kssk\u00e5p",

However, the buildings are built in such a steep slope that you still have windows on the other side that are quite high above the ground. Every time you see negative floor numbers this is what is happening.",

            "comment": "Plan is floor yeah, thats a bad translation by sgs. The entrance floor should be on plan 1 i\u2019m guessing. But lots of buildings aren\u2019t built on a flat surface so thats why maybe thay call some floors -1..? Check the \u201dplanl\u00f6sning\u201d floor plan to see if you have windows. All of the apartments should have windows. So I guess it depends on your definition of basement. If you get an offer you can always get in contact with the previous tenant before accepting the offer in case you are worried.",

People who rent out their basement privately is another matter though (illegal, buut if you can get some place to stay you don't report it).",

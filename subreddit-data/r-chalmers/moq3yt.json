    "postText": "Hello Everyone\n\nI'm new to this community. I wanted to know more about the course MSc in Mobility Engineering at Chalmers. I came to know an Automotive Engineering course existed before Mobility Engineering, and that this course is fairly new. \n\n1. Could anyone help me understand why this course has been re-strategised this way?\n2. What are the job prospects of Non-EU students in Sweden after graduation from Chalmers?\n3. Does this course hold well for PhD as well?\n4. Is it recommended to choose Sweden over Germany for automotive engineering? (Being a non-EU student I would have to learn both the languages from scratch and hence would like to get some information about these things.) \n\nThank You",

Showing effort to learn swedish could take you a long way if you want to pursuit a job in Sweden. I have no information about the german market but there are (if I'm not miss-remembering) some interesting aoutomation companies here in Gothenburg that might hire people from that master.",

The programme is completely new for this year although it is an evolution of the Automotive and Naval masters.\n\n1. This was driven a lot from the industry as they are looking more to people with a more modern education. It also allowed Chalmers to add Aerospace and Railway technology as new pathways.\n\n2. I would say there are a lot of opportunities as the creation of the programme was driven a lot by the Swedish industry. Chalmers also works closely with Volvo (and many other companies) for a lot of projects related to automotive engineering so there are a lot of opportunities there as well\n\n3. I'm not sure but I can't imagine that it would be different from any other at Chalmers.\n\n4. The course is given in English so you wouldn't need to learn Swedish. I think about 1/3 of master students are international.",

If anyone is interested in AI, with or without any knowledge or experience in the subject, I really recommend this super interesting article by \"Software 2.0\" (meaning AI).  \nIt gave me a great insight on how it developed, how it can be applied and how it might develop in the future! Might give you a competitive edge if you're doing or studying something like this at Chalmers...;)  \nhttps://pub.towardsai.net/software-2-0-b52131f65b68",

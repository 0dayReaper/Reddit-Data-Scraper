    "postText": "Hej! I'm an Italian student (hopefully) about to graduate from Polytechnic of Milan in Automation engineering and I have applied at Chalmers for an M.Sc. in System, Control and Mechatronics.\nI have some questions and I'll try to be as schematic as possible:\n\n1) how realistic is it for a master's student to be able to live in Gothenburg on his own means, without financial help? I have asked to some international students on Unibuddy and all of them except one told me that it is practically impossible to study at Chalmers and work enough hours to sustain myself;\n\n2) what kind of jobs would be available to a student with a basic (I will start studying Swedish but I don't expect to reach even B1 by August) Knowledge of Swedish? I imagine that academical jobs and internships will be available in English but what about jobs like sales assistant, customer service, receptionist etc etc?\n\n3) what is the typical weekly workload? How many hours would I be expected to spend on lecturesojects and assignments? \n\n4) what areas of Gothenburg would you advice?\n\n5) for who has attended this programme: which courses would you advice?\n\nThanks to everyone in advance :)",

I've seen some people do it, and they always fail at least 50 percent of their cources. \n\nWorking like 10-20 h works fine. Pretty easy to get work as a TA at some chalmers courses. Good pay for master students too if i remember correctly.",

I've seen that an average student budget is around 10000 kr, so I guess that I would work enough to get (10000-csn) kr.\nI wouldn't dream to work 40h though, I imagine that would be impossible while studying, I was thinking about around 20h per week.\n\nFrom what you know do you think that working 20h would let me earn that amount?",

Generally I would recommend against doing this, as you would need to work quite a lot of hours to cover your expenses even with low rent and living expenses. It is technically possible, though.\n\n2) Bartenders and waiters do not always speak Swedish from my experience.\n\n3) Depends on the courses you are taking. Generally you are recommended to study 40 hours/week but you can usually get away with doing a lot less. The less you work on school, the worse your grades will be, however.\n\n4) The housing market in Gothenburg is very bad for anyone trying to find an apartment to rent, so just take anything you can get. You can maybe get a good apartment through Chalmers Studentbost\u00e4der as they have apartments for international master students.",

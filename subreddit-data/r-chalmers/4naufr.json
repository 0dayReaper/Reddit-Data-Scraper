We have been looking for quite some time, and Boplats Gothenburg is getting very crowded. Does anyone have any tips on how to get accomodation, or better yet, knows a place for us to stay for six months? Any help is greatly appreciated.",

Being able to help you with this is their job! \n\nGood luck with the hunt. ",

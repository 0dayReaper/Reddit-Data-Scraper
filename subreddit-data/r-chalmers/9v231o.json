    "postText": "Hi! I don't know if this is the right place for this kind of posts but, well, in the worst scenario I'll be downvoted so I take the risk.  \n  \n**TL;DR**: I'm computer science student from Poland and I'm thinking about moving to Sweden and getting master's degree at Chalmers. I have couple of questions about the University in general and looking for a anyone that maybe was in similar situations to talk about more specific things and experiences.  \n  \nI study computer science at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. Currently I'm on my last semester and about to get bachelor's degree. I don't know if this is relevant but I'm also working in IT. I want to start master's studies just after that but recently I began to consider other options than my current university.  \nSomehow I stumbled accross the Chalmers University and it appeared to me as a good choice. I was happy to see that the foreigners are welcome there (yay, no tuition fees!) and the list of computer science related courses looked interesting. I read about the prerequisites to start the studies and it seems like the translated documents and passed English test are most important (that's where I might got a bit too excited ;)). The webpage provides a lot of information and guides and this is really great thing for me but still, it's kind of a big decision I have to make - that's why I want to hear some opinions from the actual Chalmers students. If you share yours - so many thanks to you!  \nIt would be even better to find someone that was in similar situation, especially foreigner from EU. If you are this person, feel free to comment or contact me via PM - I would love to hear some tips and experiences!  \nOk, so the most important questions from me:  \n1. Is it hard to get there? I mean, how many people get accepted? Do many people apply there?  \n2. How good your grades have to be to have some chances of being accepted (are very good ones + some major projects enough or rather you have to be a genius with significant achievements?)?  \n3. How hard are the studies? I know it's hard to tell or compare it but it's all about how you feel about it. Do you spend lots of time studying? Is repeating the courses common?  \n4. Is studying and being employed common in Sweden?  \nI can't think of anything more right now but maybe later something more will come to mi mind.  \n  \nI'm so grateful if you read all of it and even more grateful if you are going to respond. I'm looking forward to hear from you.",

            "comment": "Hi there,\n\nThis is the right place. I'm a first year Master's student at Computer Systems and Networks programme (MPCSN) at Chalmers. I'm from within the EU.\n\n\\&gt; I don't know if this is relevant but I'm also working in IT.\n\nIt is very relevant. I have my Bachelor's degree in mathematics and about 6 years of work experience in industry, as well as my hobbies and extracurricular activities are related to technology (robotics, hackathons). Why I'm saying it is - I really think that I've made my way in because of my non-academic-yet-very-related background. Secondly, depending on your experience, the knowledge you have may give you huge boost and it will be much much easier to cope with new concepts you've never heard of. For example, concepts presented in Operating Systems will make more sense if you know linux systems and low level programming. But don't be stressed, that is just an example which might help you along the way.\n\n\\&gt; Somehow I stumbled accross the Chalmer's University and it appeared to  me as a good choice. I was happy to see that the foreigners are welcome  there (yay, no tuition fees!)\n\nThis one is a double edged-sword! Yes, no tuition fees. However, please, please take into account, that tuition is only the tip of the iceberg. It is very hard to find an apartment because of the queue system, with thousands of people. Second of all, the rent is sky high here, and is almost the same price one has to pay for the education. I pay 650 Euros for a room / month (+deposit of 1.2k instantly). Of course, you might get lucky and find something really great and cheap and so on. But I also know guys who are still looking for an apartment. In November!\n\n\\&gt; I read about the prerequisites to start the studies and it seems like  the translated documents and passed English test are most important  (that's where I might got a bit too excited ;))\n\nBe super careful about the requirements and follow your progress on [universityadmissions.se](https://universityadmissions.se) . To be honest, I was not admitted the previous year because one, a copy was missing / was not uploaded properly.\n\n\\&gt; Is it hard to get there? I mean, how many people get accepted? Do many people apply there?\n\nI guess, we all have the same question at the start :) . I don't remember from heart, but there is a website in Swedish that has these numbers. If you like, I could share the packet I sent to Chalmers, but don't rely on that too much. The reasons why (or why not) will most likely never be revealed to public. And they might change from year to year, what kind of students / competences they are looking for, etc. But, I suppose, the numbers are limited.\n\n\\&gt; How good your  grades have to be to have some chances of being accepted (are very good  ones + some major projects enough or rather you have to be a genius with  significant achievements?)?\n\nI did not enjoy my Bachelor's studies, especially during the first years. That had an impact on my score, come out with GPA of 7.7 / 10. Plus related work experience, projects, hobbies, etc.\n\n\\&gt; How hard are  the studies? I know it's hard to tell or compare it but it's all about  how you feel about it. Do you spend lots of time studying? Is repeating  the courses common?\n\nA lot. I would say, that I spent about 10 to 12 hours per day, including holidays. Some homeworks require spending 60+ hours and you might get multiple in parallel. But although they are hard, most of them are super fun as well, and the quality is world class. I've had only 4 courses so far but Operating Systems ([https://vincenzogulisano.com/](https://vincenzogulisano.com/)) and Computer Architecture ([https://www.chalmers.se/sv/personal/Sidor/per-stenstrom.aspx](https://www.chalmers.se/sv/personal/Sidor/per-stenstrom.aspx)) are mind blowing. They are the best lectures, I've ever had and the best ones I've ever seen (easily comparable with those read at MIT, CMU, Georgia Tech). Most of professors here have been involved for those universities / institutions at some level. But there are courses I decided not to take and did not enjoy. What I highly suggest is - talk to professors, students, etc. and they might help you to me better study decisions. All in all, you're here to study and learn things, which is the focus in my opinion anyway (but yes, there are parties, movies, bars, etc.)\n\n\\&gt; Is studying and being employed common in Sweden?\n\n  \nCurrently having negotiations with companies. Most of them are looking for full time employee, some of them offer flexible hours. I managed to get a remote job, but many students are working in parallel to their studies at Chalmers. And many companies offer paid, non-9-to-5 internships.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy two cents, feel free to contact me.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I don't  remember from heart, but there is a website in Swedish that has these  numbers.\n\nYup, just checked it - one of the redditors mentioned it above. I'm surprised how many of the applicants are outside Sweden.\n\n&gt;Be super careful about the requirements and follow your progress on [universityadmissions.se](https://universityadmissions.se/) . To be honest, I was not admitted the previous year because one, a copy was missing / was not uploaded properly.\n\nAnother helpful website and good advice - I'm definitely going to check everything ten times before the application.\n\nI have **extremely** important question now. I've just checked \"[Key dates](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/application-admission/Pages/Key-dates.aspx)\" section on the Chalmers website and I want to ask at which point do I have to be after a thesis defense? Is it 01.02? (\"The deadline for all supporting documentation\")? I'm asking because my University shared the diploma exam schedule just a week ago and it says that exams end on 05.02. Now I'm stressed...\n\nAlso I've just learned that university semesters in Sweden differ from the polish ones (master's studies in Poland lasts five semesters and starts in February/March). This whole time I thought that I would start my studies in Sweden in next (spring/summer) semmester... I think I've just assumed that Bologna Process determine it. Well, I'm dumb.\n\nThanks for sharing your experience and precious advices. It really helps.",

There are two dofferent masters Computer Networks and Systems (hacking and programming basically, much fun) and Computer Algorithms, Logic and L-something (system architecture etc I think).\nCSN is a bit smaller in number of applicants than CSALL AFAIK.\n\nDon't know current grades to get in, but as studying goes, some courses are harder and some more interesting. If you don't succeed in a course there will be miltiple occasions to do a re-exam in the course during the year.\n\nBecause of EU you should be able to apply for your masters without any tuition in any EU country. Go EU!\n\nI think there are a lot of people working beside their studies.",

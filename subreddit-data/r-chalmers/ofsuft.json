If anyone is interested in AI, with or without any knowledge or experience in the subject, I really recommend this super interesting article by \"Software 2.0\" (meaning AI).  \nIt gave me a great insight on how it developed, how it can be applied and how it might develop in the future! Might give you a competitive edge if you're doing or studying something like this at Chalmers...;)  \nhttps://pub.towardsai.net/software-2-0-b52131f65b68",

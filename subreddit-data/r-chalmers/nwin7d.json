    "postText": "Hi all! I'm a new user to reddit, and not sure is this the right place to ask...\n\nI'm a second year computer science in information system student in my country, the study mostly is about data science. But I have just discover my interest in computer graphics and I want to further my study in that topic.\n\nHowever, I just realised that the prerequisite for MSc Interaction design and technologies include Human-computer interaction. The course is not cover in my major. \n\nIt is weird tho, I try to do research on other university, but they don't seems stict on this part, as long as you are a CS student.\n\nIs there anyway I can get away with that? Or is there anyone who have the same issue before? If yes, what is your solution? \n\nPlus, can you share your experience on this course? Especially the info about profile: game dev focused on gameplay design and integration design which include courses like comouter graphics, game engine architecture, AI, mobile computing and gameplay design.\n\n\nMuch appreciated! Have a nice day!\n\n\nFYI,\n- switching major (IS) is impossible for me, because I would have to extend one more year to do so and it might not be successful to apply.\n- I'm foreigner, outside of EU.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, i\u2019m an international student in the application process to get a masters degree at Chalmers. Recently I got an e-mail saying I was awarded an Avancez scholarship, but in my application status I still have \u201cQualified\u201d and not \u201cAccepted\u201d. How can I be awarded an scholarship by the university and still not have the accepted status yet? Does it mean I can still be rejected? ",

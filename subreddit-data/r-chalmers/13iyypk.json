Since you finished with a degree, it is assumed you will be able to learn the hard skills you will need. A more common problem is not being able to work in a team which is much more difficult for the employer to teach you.\n\nSo, if you are social, able to work in teams and have one or two relevant summerjobbs or internships after finishing Chalmers you are WAY ahead of someone why has finished Chalmers with 5 in all courses, but who has no social skills or work experience.",

I think it's a reliable indicator of abstract reasoning skill.\n\nThat's not to say everyone wants to see a students grades.

The real unemployment rate is below 1%. If you want to make it an upper class life then you need really good grades, or to stand out in some other way, or get lucky.\n\nTake something like nurse programs are guaranteed a job but it will be a lower class one unless they are exceptional. Several of the social science programs either turn lower class academic or don\u2019t work in their field. Those are not promising. Engineering is the lazy option to the Swedish dream of villa vove Volvo.",

But I wouldn't go so far as not to show them to a prospective employer if they ask for it. The only time I was asked to show my grade was for a very particular subject very relevant to the job I was applying to ! And I happily obliged.\n\nBut would like to add that grades matter quite a lot if you are applying for a PhD position. Because as a PhD student in Sweden you get to transfer 30 credits from your Masters education to your PhD, and for you to be able to do that you need to have Grade 4 or Grade 5. Otherwise you will have to take 30 credits all over again in your PhD, which is a huge waste of time.",

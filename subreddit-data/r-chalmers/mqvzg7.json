    "postText": "Yes, i know its been asked multiple times.\nYes, i know its not advisable cause it messes up with your academics and the pay isn\u2019t enough to cover the expenses.\nI want to be practical about this and work for around 10-15 hrs/week which i feel is manageable. Maybe as a receptionist or  do deliveries or any job.\nI\u2019m learning swedish (i\u2019m a non-EU international student, extremely proficient in English)\n\nMy whole logic is, even if i earn 1k bucks, i can spend that on myself- maybe on food, maybe on drinks, maybe get a book from a library or something.\nThe point being, i am more than willing to put 2hrs a day or maybe 4/5 hrs in a weekend and earn some extra bucks.\n\nI think it is quite manageable and I would really appreciate if someone could help me by shedding some light as to where do i search for openings?\nHow do i find 10-15hrs/week ish jobs in Gothenburg?",

Worth looking into though! \n\nOtherwise I'd say getting a job at a bar would be a good option. Foodora is also an option...but they don't treat you well and you're out delivering food in the rain/wind/cold on your own bike and time.",

I'm not 100% sure but Andra L\u00e5nggatan and the surrounding area is full of bars and they'd be more likely to hire you than the bars on Avenyn (more expensive and fancy). You can also try to find something part-time at a caf\u00e9 since there are so many in Gothenburg! Bars and caf\u00e9s will like your proficiency in English.",

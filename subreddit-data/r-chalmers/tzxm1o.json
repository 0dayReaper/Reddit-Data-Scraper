            "comment": "I'm in the first year of the program right now. \n\nMy opinions of it have changed a lot during the year. At first it was very pretentious, with a lot of talk about entrepreneurial personalities and stuff like that. All the clich\u00e9s about entrepreneurship were mentioned at least once a day. It made me question if it was really a good choice for me. But once we got past the introductory phase, things got so much better really quickly. Most notably, we were given a case that spanned 3 courses over the entire semester. It was one of the best experiences I've had with any school project. Right now I'm taking another course which is basically a simulation of being in charge of a small company, with all the stress and difficulties that comes with that. All in all, I've been continually impressed with the courses and projects, but the entrepreneur clich\u00e9s could be toned down a notch. \n\nRegarding being international, you won't have any problems whatsoever. All of the courses are entirely taught in English, and all of the Swedish students switch language whenever one of the international students are around. I think there are like 5 international students in my class of 40 students total. \n\nHope this helps, and and if you have any other questions, just send me a DM!",

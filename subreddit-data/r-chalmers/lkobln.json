It says that countries which are part of the EEA are also permitted to free tuition, however I am unsure if UK is/will be part of it. Further, if you apply through Erasmus or similar programme, you should not have to pay tuition. \n\nTo get further guidance I would advice you to contact either *admissions* or *tuitionfees*, the contact information can be found [here](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/Pages/contact.aspx)\n\nHope it works out for you",

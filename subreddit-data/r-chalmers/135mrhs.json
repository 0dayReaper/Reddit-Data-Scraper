    "postText": "Hi everyone, I was recently admitted to the Algorithms, languages and logic MS program at Chalmers.\nMy main interest is Algorithms and when I look at the program plan I see that there are some courses that are not among elective courses of this program (Image Processing, Stochastic optimization algorithms and so on) but there are listed in other programs.\nMy question is can I take elective courses that are in different master programs if yes will the credits be added to my program?\n\n If anyone studies this program any feedback would be appreciated.",

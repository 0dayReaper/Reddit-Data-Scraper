The main difference I do know is that they used to have very little math as part of the program compared to Chalmers programs. My gut feeling is that it might be less competitive than the Chalmers programs, but that it still produces some good students.",

There are two main queues for student housing, sgs and chalmers studentbost\u00e4der. Sgs has housing all over gothenburg some are pretty close to city center. Chalmers studentbost\u00e4der has almost exclusively housing close to either the johanneberg campus and the lindholmen campus. You have to apply to the queue.  There might also be some separate queue for international students if that applies to you. Best of luck!",

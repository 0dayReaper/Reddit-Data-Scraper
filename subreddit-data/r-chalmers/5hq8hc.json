    "postText": "Hello!  \nI was wondering if you guys could help me out. I'm going on Erasmus to Chalmers next year in autumn and I am struggling with course choices. I chose Engineering Mathematics and Computational Science programme and I am not decided which courses to take. I have picked Mechanics of solids and Stochastic data processing for the first autumn block, then Nonlinear optimisation and don't know what to pick with it. I am deciding between Options and mathematics and Basic stochastic processes, because the others seem quite hard.  \nDo you have any experience with these classes? What would you pick?",

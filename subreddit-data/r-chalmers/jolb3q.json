So I\u2019m going to apply to Nanotechnology Master\u2019s in Chalmers and some other universities. I\u2019ve got all my documents and everything. Just want to know about scholarships, research assistant positions and daily life in Sweden. If you\u2019re willing to talk about these subjects, feel free to msg me. (Btw I\u2019ve got 3.17 GPA, 102 TOEFL and a project proposal ready. Also, I\u2019m from Turkey.)",

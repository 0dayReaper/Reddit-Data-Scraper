            "comment": "Just finished my masters thesis a few weeks ago.\n\nI think it's a good masters degree, but that will be dependent on what you did for your bachelor's. A solid foundation in math and programming is absolutely necessary. Then, you can go in a few different directions, like data science or computational biology. This is specified on the home page. There are only a few mandatory courses, taking up the first semester, after which you are free to choose your own electives. Some must be from a list of \"obligatory electives\", and some are completely up to you. This lets you customize the program to fit your preference to a high degree.\n\nIt's very sought after on the work market, and I was able to secure a job at a large consulting agency months before graduation.\n\nHope that helps!",

            "comment": "One alternative at Chalmers is to take the Engineering Mathematics and Computional Science master's degree. When I took it. There were only 3 compulsory courses + thesis and 5 elective courses that had to come from an approved list of Mathematical/statistical/computer science/optimization/machine learning courses. There is a lot of overlap between this list and the courses of CAS. In addition this leaves 4 courses over which you have 100% control. You could use these to go deeper into CAS or to explore any technical (and technically non-technical if you wish) field.\n\nIt is a very flexible programme if you happen to like the (applied) mathematcal approach to technical fields.",

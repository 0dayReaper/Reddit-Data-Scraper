    "postText": "Good morning. As a future DS&amp;AI student here at Chalmers I'm looking for an accommodation, to move to Gothenburg starting from August. While searching for housing, I notice that the computer science department is separated from the rest of University (I mean, the building between Landala and Johanneberg).So a (maybe dumb) question: where should I attend my lessons? Based on the course, Do I have to go both to the computer science department and and headquarters in Johanneb\n\nI hope I was as clear as possible, thanks in advance!",

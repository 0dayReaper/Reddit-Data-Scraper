    "postText": "Hej,\nWith a bunch of Chalmers students, we are developing a time machine: Immerseum. Well a virtual one. ;) \n\nWe are looking for feedbacks or even people interested to join the project! \n\nHere is a more in depth description:\nImagine being able to take a stroll through ancient Rome. Being able to take a whole class on a virtual field trip in a Mayan temple. How about witnessing the Bonaparte campaign in Russia, or meeting the Vikings first hand? \n\nBy offering a free crowd-sourcing platform of Historical immersive content, integrating a framework that bridges the skills available from the online community(historians, 3D artists...), we deliver a new generation of what we call \"edutainment\" experiences to recreate the whole of History.\n\nFeel free to contact me directly for any info! :) \nHave a great day!

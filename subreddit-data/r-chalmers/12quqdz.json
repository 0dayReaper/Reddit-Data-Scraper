From what I search, Chalmers university has aerodynamics or CFD related research. May I ask you, did you apply for master programme? Would you like to share the procedure?\n\nI wonder how much people applying since from yoir story the university office says that the competition is superhard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStay strong",

Most likely it will be very low and maybe even low enough to be hard to measure, but if there is anyone who has access to relevant equipment and would get a kick out of helping me, it would be much appreciated.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_glass\n\nI live in Gothenburg, speak Swedish and i\u00b4m not a student of Chalmers.\nI \"know\" that they are Uranium, because the fluoresce under UV-light.

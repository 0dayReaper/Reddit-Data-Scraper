    "postText": "Hi,\n\nIf you've been accepted to the Computer Systems and Networks programme then I will most likely be your class/group/etc. mate. It might mean that we are going to spend most of our study time together. So I would like to know you better :\\)\n\nMy really short intro: My name is Martins and I come from a rather small, neighbouring country Latvia. I graduated from the University of Latvia, Faculty of Physics and Mathematics back in 2012. Afterwards, I decided to pursue my career in IT. For the 5\\-6 years I've been working mostly in the fields of LEMP stack development and linux system administration. I fill my free time with autonomous sumo robots, system ricing, sports \\(tennis, running, snowboarding\\) and family. I do beleive that I am friendly and supportive and would like to meet as many of you as possible.\n\nCheers,Martins",

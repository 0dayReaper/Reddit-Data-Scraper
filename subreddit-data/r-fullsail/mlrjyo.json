            "comment": "At a traditional college, you typically work towards a bachelor's (4-year degree) and get an associate's (2-year degree) along the way. Either as a minor in what you're working towards, or a gen ed associate of arts. As a result at traditional college, you could go to school for 3 years and drop for whatever reason (fail, lose interest, get a job, etc) and still have associates to show for it.\n\nHistorically at Full Sail, this wasn't the case which put students who end up dropping for whatever reason at a disadvantage. To remedy this they incorporated associates. As it stands, you *could* get an associate's in *certain* degrees *if* you drop for whatever reason. That way you have something to show for your time. If you end up completing a bachelor's, the associate's is nullified because there's no real point to having it as it's the traditional progression.\n\nFor instance, if you take the path to go to the University of Central Florida you may go to Valencia College first to save money and get an Associates of Arts before transferring to UCF for a Bachelor's in whatever degree. When you graduate with that bachelor's you're not out saying \"You have an Associate's of Arts and a Bachelor's in Computer Science.\" It's just not worth it.\n\nThere *are* exceptions at traditional colleges, like focusing your gen-ed classes on a particular specialty. For the above example of getting a Bachelor's in Computer Science, you may choose to \"minor\" in math, which would technically give you an Associates in Science for Math. Full Sail doesn't offer *this type* of associate's right now because most degrees have a set path of classes.\n\nSo, tl;dr: You *do* probably have an Associates of Art in Digital Cinematography, but once you get a Bachelors you just have the Bachelors. You don't have both because the latter assumes you earned the former as part of the process.",

For my luck during the housing crisis, they dropped me. Not my fault, but all I got from them were memories of homelessness,  student loans for no degree that will saddle me for the rest of my life, and a ton of salt about how sketch they are for kicking out a student who was trying while they screwed him because a car hit him. Yeah. All those older students got screwed. Full sail took their loans, decided they didn't want them as students anymore and dropped them. No conflict of interest there at all. You can't tell I'm salty at them kicking me out and causing me to be homeless during the housing crisis, right?",

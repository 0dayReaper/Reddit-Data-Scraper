    "postText": "My daughter is considering this program. Pros and cons?? She has been accepted at West Virginia University also and they have a great program as well. But honestly Full Sail is half the time, half the cost and seemingly better connections as WVU is focused on collegiate sports. Her ultimate goal is NFL coverage. Any thoughts??",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a Game Art grad so I can\u2019t speak to her program, but the schedule is definitely accelerated, and the school is more affordable then others for sure. The faster program can be tough though, you don\u2019t really get breaks and time off. I suggest occasionally taking a month off or so to avoid burnout (you can do this easily up to 3 times). The career center is amazing and the primary reason I enrolled. The NFL Network and a few other things are listed as employers and partners so I\u2019m sure jobs pop up frequently. The WWE is also a huge partner, the production students for live events do a lot of the FL shows.\n\nI can\u2019t say which school is better, but Full Sail is definitely worth it and consideration. The fact I can audit classes from my major any time I want a refresher for free is amazing.",

            "comment": "Hey I\u2019m IATSE local in Tampa, best way to get into sports is to just do sport. Go work as an intern for a local team or wherever you get an offer, or find a regional broadcaster and ask if they\u2019re hiring or looking for a Camera PA. Whatever gets your foot in the door is typically much better then what a college can offer. Also, the film industry doesn\u2019t ask or require a degree.\n\nBefore anyone wants to spend a bunch of money on school, I\u2019d recommend just trying to get an internship or apprenticeship. I\u2019ve never had any one of my colleagues say college was worth it and I think it\u2019s worth skipping it for a year and just try it without it. At worst you can always go back if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right way for you.",

I've mostly had classes that are not specific to Sportscasting, but the few so far that are were great. Experts in the industry teaching the expectations and providing excellent feedback. It seems I am missing a bit by not being an in person student, so on campus is likely the best route. All in all, I'd recommend. I'll answer any other questions to the best of my ability.",

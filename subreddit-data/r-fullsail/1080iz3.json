    "postText": "Hello All,\n\nI'm a potential Recording Arts student possibly starting classes in March.\n\nMy questions about Full Sail all revolve around the likelihood of finding a good, career starting job in my industry upon graduation. I am not a traditional student, I have degree work from a previous life and am hoping to use Full Sail's program to transfer into something a bit more financially lucrative.  I've got no time left to faff around. What are the placement services like at Full Sail?\n\n I am not looking for someone to get a job for me, but for a comparison of what I mean by \"placement services\" my sister graduated from the Rinker School at UF. They had a yearly job fair with 150 companies present each year. She got her current position before she graduated directly from connections she made at that job fair. \n\nAre there opportunities like that at Full Sail? Are they frequent? Is there any sort of guidance from the school while looking for a job?\n\nIt's hard for me to judge the legitimacy of any claims made by admissions, tour guides, etc. because every conversation I have inevitably ends with them saying, \"You get out what you put in.\" I heard it so much it started to feel like a mantra chanted by devoted cult members. Is that phrase spewed so the school can hedge their bets? Does it allow them to guarantee things without actually guaranteeing them? Or is it legitimate advice that just sounds fishy coming from representatives of a for profit university? \n\nI've read such mixed things about finding a job after graduating Full Sail and that's hard to square with how much success the alumni seem to have. Someone has to be misrepresenting something. Any clarification or help from current students looking for jobs or alumni who have already been through the process would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

I graduated from a different program, but had friends in RA, most people are in a different industry, and the ones who are actually in the industry either had a lot of money and opened up a studio or had made connections. Full Sail isn't a bad college at all but I feel its not worth the price. Its also a good way to make connections if you are serious. \n\nBut if you are looking for something Financially Lucrative , I wont suggest going to FS and spending 80k, your returns wont be worth it. \n\nYou might see FS showing off their grad list and where they worked, but what they fail to tell you is there are people graduating EVERY month, lets say there is a class of 30, which brings your total RA grads annually to 300+. \n\nThey are a for-profit industry and they will sell themselves to you. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.",

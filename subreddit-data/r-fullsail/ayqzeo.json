            "comment": "online full sail is completely different than campus full sail. full sail is a school where you REALLY get what you put in. and being an online students it\u2019s kinda hard to put in more because you aren\u2019t surrounded by the resources that campus students have. some say it\u2019s a bad school because they did bad. simple as that but for you i would follow your dreams. Animation studios visit campus all the time looking for recruits. good luck!!!!",

It\u2019s a school where you can most definitely learn amazing things but you have to commit to it. If you have passion and dedication for whatever subject you want to pursue then go for it. I don\u2019t want to scare you but there is quite a lot of work involved, it wont be easy but its most definitely doable! The feeling you get from passing each class is quite fantastic! Good Luck on whatever you decide to do!!!",

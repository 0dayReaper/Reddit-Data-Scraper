    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m (22F) not from a family with a ton of money and I myself am attending community college where I don\u2019t have to pay anything towards my education. Full Sail has always been my dream college because art is sometime I find myself drawn to in many ways but I\u2019m afraid I might not be able to afford it. \nMy question is, what are some things I can do to earn money while attending Full Sail? Is a full time or even part time job doable?",

For me it was important to find a desk job so I wasn't physically exhausted at the end of each workday. I'm not suggesting you do the same, but it's something to keep in mind. \n\nwith that being said, the classes aren't that hard. It's just time consuming if you want to get a lot out of them (networking is a HUGE thing, and working on relevant side projects goes a long way).",

Almost every course online allows you access to the weeks work at the beginning of the week to get the work done early at your own pace. I've kept a full time job through out my schooling here. Just remember that procrastination will kill you; typically the weeks work cannot be completed on a single Saturday and some classes require you to collaborate with a team, so schedule early and communicate often with the team.",

And when I do ask for help from instructors or can get the time off they always tell me how I shouldn\u2019t be working. Which just gets very discouraging , I also wouldn\u2019t expect to get a quality art education from this college as someone who was a painting and drawing major at an actual university for a period of time. Fullsail expects whatever you\u2019re studying to have maybe 2 to 3 years plus program knowledge. So if you don\u2019t you will be teaching yourself everything from scratch and with a decent job that pays well, doing that is VERY difficult and taxing on your mental health and self esteem I would not recommend",

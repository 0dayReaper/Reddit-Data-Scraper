Not to say that I'm not going to try, I'm just being realistic with myself. \n\nBut how hard is it to maintain a good GPA in this degree program? What are your experiences; what did you graduate with?",

But at full sail on month 8 I have a 3.5 with that said I worked really hard and I am also in game development. I\u2019d say 4.0 will require your attention to detail on all assignments it\u2019s easy to lose points from my POV.",

After you hit your first project based class you WILL need a lot of time to work on it. I can\u2019t continue the college cause I don\u2019t have enough time to be meticulous on my projects. Regardless I earned a job that starts me off at a higher salary than a game designer would earn so it\u2019s another deciding factor for me leaving the school. To answer your question, you could probably maintain that if you really have a lot of time on your hands and just focus, message your instructors constantly with questions and do a lot of research. You will need to be a rockstar student to keep that GPA.",

But I'm pregnant :( I'm due in June so I'm lucky that we're starting off with the easy classes and maybe I can get adjusted before we hit the hard classes, but with a 5 year old and newborn, I might not have the same availability that I do now. My toddler is pretty good at entertaining herself. Glad to hear about your job, though. That's primarily the reason to go to college, right? Lol. One of my teachers already asked to use one of my projects for examples to future students, but again, I think these first few classes are very easy.",

One of the most important points I have learned is that if you don't do your homework (labs, projects, assignments) you will lose TONS of points, and the exams aren't anything to scoff at either.\n\nYou got this.",

They do not hold your hand, if you want to learn you have to take the initiative. At university, I was able to maintain ~3.5 while hardly trying and barely going to class. I honestly think I have a 3.0 at FS while trying pretty hard, but I also work full time so that could be a factor to the drop as well. I\u2019m going to graduate in a few months, and I expect it to stay about the same.",

            "comment": "I know this is kind of late, but I'm a month away from graduating Full Sail in Game Art, online, and I think it has all been said. I have a 3.5 GPA and it has been rough, they do not hold your hand. They give you the base information and leave it to you to figure out a lot. If you are going to ask questions make sure you look it up first and I truly see this as a a positive because in any industry you are expected to learn on your own. But even more-so in the video game industry (constantly evolving programs and workflows means constant learning) and Full Sail is a vocational school which means they are basically treating it like work.  \n\n\nI worked full time the entirety of my degree and put a lot of time into doing the work. I pulled at least one all nighter a month and had to skip every social gathering for the 2 1/2 years of the degree. But I thoroughly enjoyed it. To put it simply and in a very cliche way, you get out what you put in. I am looking at some students in the second to last class with some really professional models and some that look like they just started. After talking to the other students a lot of the people who do \"poorly\" are the ones who complained about the teachers and complained that they weren't taught as much as they wanted. Meanwhile, the students who have professional looking models are the ones who acknowledged that but didn't complain about it. The one's that took it in stride and used it as a jumping off point to research the things they enjoyed and were interested in. I've seen some world class monsters (from the character artists), a few animation that look like motion capture, and some environments that are killer. But some on the other side of the scale.  \n\n\nA lot and I mean ALOT of people had to retake classes or dropped out in my time here. I started in a class about 50 to 60 and in the second to last class there are 11 students that remain. So don't underestimate the work. But, if you apply yourself and are willing to learn your niche, then it is honestly really fun. Tough, but fun.",

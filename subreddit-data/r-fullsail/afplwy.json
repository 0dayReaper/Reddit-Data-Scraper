You get out what you put in. So if you work hard, ask questions and pay attention you will learn a lot which obviously helps. \n\nSecond, you have to network. With other students, networking events and putting yourself out there as a professional in your field. There are plenty of studios and opportunities in the area and nationally for you to score but you have to show initiative and make yourself stand out compared to other candidates. Full sail has a good alumni network and a good career development but if you don\u2019t continue to put the work in you\u2019re not doing yourself any favors.  \n\nI came out of school and got a job as a music teacher and studio engineer for a music school. I started my own recording studio business and have made some money of that. then thanks to networking I connected with a few other full sail grads and students who have started a management company who is backed by Sony and has investors interested in what we do and what we can achieve. \n\nIn short, it comes down to how hard you\u2019re willing to work. For me, it has been the best decision of my life, but that doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t come without challenges. If you\u2019re serious about this move, then it will definitely work out. \n\nHope this helps! Message me directly if you have any more questions! (: ",

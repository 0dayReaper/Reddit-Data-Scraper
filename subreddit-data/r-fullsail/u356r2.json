YOU Think he's just some random person? but you know me? you know us? Interesting very \ud83e\udd14  OR THE ACTUAL RANDOM TWEAKER THAT PULLED UP ON US IN THE PARKING LOT HIGH OUT HIS DAMN MIND INSISTING I WAS HIS PLUGS MIDDLE MAN AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO GIVE HIM THE \"SHIT\" \n\nWHICH WAS CLEARLY TURNING INTO A VERY TENSE SITUATION AND WHAT DID OUR BOYS AT FULLSAIL DO? DROVE RIGHT PASS AND KEPT MOVING \n\nMAN COULDA HAD A GUN HE HAD SOMEONE ELSE IN THE CAR WITH HIM TOO BUT NOPE WE NOT STOPPING TO CHECK ID'S TODAY \n\n1 tries to run over the homie on a skateboard like craxy close to it\n\njust to say you cant skateboard on campus ANYONE ON CAMPUS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IT MAKES NO SENSE\n\n2 tries to run into my car damn near cuasing me to hit a curb BECAUSE HE HASNT SEEN THIS CAR ON CAMPUS BEFORE ???have you seen EVERY CAR THAT EVERYONE DRIVES ON CAMPUS ? YOU DO THIS FOR EVERYONE? why you aint do this for the tweaker that night in the parking lot?\n\n3Tells us we arent allowed in th building Simply because HE THOUGHT HE COULD DO THAT WE WENT AND TALKED TO SOMEONE AND THEY TOLD US YEAH IDK WHY THEY WONT LET YOU IN THERES NO REASON I KNOW OF AND YOU SHOULD BE ALLOWED IN ALL THIS  IS STILL AS A STUDENT \n\nlike yooo We got accounts for days \n\nbut again we didnt care about them because we weren't there to beef with the fake cops \n\ntbh it's tons of ways you can spin it to make it seem like they were just doing there job but its a clear line between doing your job and harassment \n\nso yall can kick rocks \n\nim personally not done with full sail i've just decided to handle it a different way\n\nand man stop responding to old ass comments and post just to say something simple and stupid you just look petty OH I JUST HAD TO LET HIM KNOW IF HE DIDNT HAVE A ID dont do it here dont do it on youtube dont do it on twitter JUST STOP DOING THINGS LIKE THAT whats wrong with \n\nThumbs me down if you want i dont care \n\ni wasnt the only person in this situation\n\nand im the hot head so i know this whole situation was outta pocket",

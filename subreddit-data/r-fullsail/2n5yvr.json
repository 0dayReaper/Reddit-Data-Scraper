What did you think of your program in terms of preparing you for the \"real world\"? Was the program pretty intense?\n\n2. Do you have a job lined up?  \n  \n3. Has Full Sail helped you with your job search? If so, how helpful have they been? \n  \n4. Do you have any advice for someone just starting to get their master's at Full Sail in order to get the most out of the program and the faculty?",

                    "comment": "\n1.  To be honest I feel more prepared for a \u201creal world\u201d job than I thought I was going to be.  This is mostly from the amount of stress the program puts on professionalism and attention to detail.  When the difference between an A and B is as little as naming a file correctly or spelling something incorrectly you learn fairly quickly to triple check everything you submit.  As far as intensity is concerned it varies from course to course.  It feels as if they purposefully pace the program so that you do not get overwhelmed but some courses are pretty difficult.  The most time I was putting into schoolwork for one course was around 30-35 hours a week, on the other hand I completed a months worth of work for college algebra in about two days.  For a masters program I would guess the time you need to put it would be slightly more.\n\n2.  At the moment I do not have a job lined up.  I am however applying for freelance positions and submitting my resume to companies.\n\n3.  Full Sail has helped me with my job search.   Two months away from graduation you are assigned a career advisor who reviews your resume and gives you some advice based on what to look for in what part of the country you want.  This being said, do not expect full sail to call companies for you and just throw jobs in your lap.  They give you the tools to find jobs you are well suited for but you still have to put in the legwork on your own.\n\n4.  My advice to you would be this, don\u2019t leave anything on the table.  As an online student it\u2019s really easy to get away with doing the bare minimum to succeed and pass a class.  This approach, however easy it may be, will get you nowhere.  If you really want to be able to get everything out of Full Sail\u2019s online program you have to push yourself, no one else will do it for you.  The faculty is great at being available for you to answer questions but if you are struggling with something ask for help early.  If an assignment is due at midnight and you email a question at 4 PM do not expect an answer before it is due.  Most professors are willing to work with you though.\n\nI hope this helped!\n",

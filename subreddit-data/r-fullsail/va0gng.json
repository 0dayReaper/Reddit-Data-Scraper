    "postText": "Hey guys, need some quick advice. I\u2019m in Orlando with my lil bro for a tour and he\u2019s wanting to go for 3D animation. He was turned down for private loans without a co-signer, so he\u2019s stressed. They\u2019re offering the first semester online for free, but then he loses his scholarships. \n\nI\u2019m worried because he has no actual experience in design. None. He hasn\u2019t fooled around with any programs, hasn\u2019t even done art as a hobby or past time. Is this program geared towards absolute novices? Please advise.",

            "comment": "Have to agree with zculp, Full Sail is for students with passion in a field and furthering educate them on it. It\u2019s an accelerated degree so it\u2019s one month of something then bam, on to the next topic. I\u2019ve been doing Full Sail for over a year now for Audio Production so I have no clue how 3D Animation is. I love the school but, if you say he hasn\u2019t had the slightest interest growing up with animation, I wouldn\u2019t go because the cost can be expensive. \n\nJust my thoughts.",

            "comment": "Honestly, no. While there are \"intro\" classes for most topics, they are incredibly fast paced like the rest of the school.\n\nThe school expects a lot of personal commitment. They fully anticipate/require you to invest an equal, if not greater, amount of your time outside of class time to learn.\n\nI would recommend he take a few month and try to learn some of the commonly used programs. See if he actually likes it, or even has the skill, to succeed in the program.\n\nFor the record, I am not a Design student. I am a Computer Science student.",

If he\u2019s good at math he should check out their Simulation &amp; Visualization program. They learn 3D modeling, programming, fabrication, and game/VR development. Way more career opportunities and he doesn\u2019t have to go all in one set of skills.",

            "comment": "I'm attending that program online. To be blunt, Absolutely not. The program can be brutal, for a wide variety of reasons. Campus is even more intense from my understanding. It's just not a smart move esp for the cost. There are plenty of ways to get started for free and determine if it is something he really wants to pursue. Also that \"Trial period\" is the throw away classes. What they call the Core 4. They have nothing to do with your specific degree and do not represent the rest of the program at all.\n\nMy advice is to look at typical schools. It costs less, and the advantages of learning from people who understand how to teach is so unbelievably important. Especially to a novice. Which in my experience is far and few between at Full Sail and I am a little past halfway through the program. This is not to say the school doesn't provide good information. It's just very frequently not presented in a manner conducive to learning. To put it simply just because you're good at something doesn't mean you can teach it, and many of the instructors do not have any education in education. As well the classes are clearly not audited by anyone with a background in education to determine if they are well suited to the success of the student.  \n\n\nIs it possible to attend, do great, and end up with a great career? YES! ABSOLUTELY! However for a novice the chances are so small I wouldn't even consider it. He has no reason to be disappointed. It's a blessing in disguise. Think of it like wining a used and beat on Lamborghini when you can even afford the insurance.",

    "postText": "I've already heard the argument \"they're just mad because they didn't get a job because they are lazy.\" In fact, that is the only argument I have heard repeated countless times online and in real life from people defending Full Sail. Please don't bore me by repeating this line.\n\nMy parents suggested Full Sail and I'm hesitant. There are more negative reviews than positive ones online. Some people may claim this is just because only the haters are willing to speak out - Sure, I get that... But if I look up the college I originally attended after graduating high school (Southern Methodist University), there are definitely more positive than negative reviews and outcomes regarding job placement. This leads me to believe that Full Sail's negative reviews probably have a lot of truth to them.\n\nI am looking into Full Sail and other colleges because I'm interested in a career swap. If I attended Full Sail I would only be doing so to get a degree related to film production / editing. Currently I am a teacher. I guess my real question regards whether I'll see Full Sail teachers and their programs as a joke or if I'll have respect for them and actually gain an education strong enough to secure employment.\n\nMy main concern is that potential employers, like myself, will hear \"Full Sail\" and immediately think about it being a joke of a school and somewhat of a degree mill / marketing lure.\n\n",

            "comment": "The whole spiel about 'they're mad cos they're lazy' is true though - the way that the FS system works means you're doing a shit-ton more work than the average collegiate level student in a short space of time. It churns students in and only the ones who actually work the hardest and make the most of things here get anything out of it.\nIt's not perfect by any means, and I can't speak for your specific degree interest, but I can see the merit in the system. This school doesn't pussy around with theoretical coursework in many of the degree programs and instead chooses to instill with you experience based teaching for stuff you'll actually be doing in that career path. \nTo this end, employers will value the fact that more often than not they won't need to teach you as much as someone who went to a traditional uni.",

Game studios, live production people, and many others are in touch with Full Sail. \n\nI started in a class of probably 200+. We were asked what success meant to us, and many of them recited that \"success is a million copies\". One of the students gave out copies of their mixtape at the end of the month. By the last class, we had well under 50 people. That's about 8 people a month in average not passing the classes. It does have a lot to do with who is lazy and who isn't, even if you don't want to hear that - but then again I was competing with people that needed help opening a file. All the people that came to be famous producers ended up failing, and all the people that came to learn ended up excelling and leaving with job placement or great prospects.

If you go an expect to coast through while putting in the minimum amount of work and have someone hand you a job when you get out, you're in for a bad time.\n\nA lot of people scoff at Full Sail being a \"for profit\" school, but having experienced both the traditional college system and Full Sail, I can tell you that Full Sail by far and away has access to better equipment and more staff closely tied to your field of work than your standard university. Use that to your advantage and exploit those resources. Go to every open lab you can. Hell, go to someone else's lab. You're only there for a comparatively short time and you're paying for it, so get your dollar's worth. Talk to your instructors, ask them questions. A great many of them have worked in your field and can offer valuable insights and tips. A lot will have contacts they can introduce you to as well and help get you started networking in your field.\n\nAs far as job placement goes, I've not had any first or second hand experience with Full Sail getting myself or anyone I know a job. But that's also true with my traditional university. The job placement department is another resource you should exploit for contacts, advice, and information, but largely it's up to you to go out there, hustle, and get that job for yourself. That's not a unique situation.\n\nGoing to Full Sail presents you with a tremendous amount of access and opportunity. How you make use of that is largely what defines your success, not the school itself.",

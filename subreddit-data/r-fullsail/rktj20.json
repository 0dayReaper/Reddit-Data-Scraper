    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nLittle background on me: I have done my complete schooling here in India and have always wanted to join the game industry as anything but a game programmer.\n\nI have so far already completed a Bachelors course (BCA) in game development, which was almost just focused on game programming rather than game design as well (it was 95% programming, unfortunately for me  -\\_- ).\n\nWhile I was planning to go for the masters course in game design here, my bachelors degree has gotten evaluated by ECE as \"the equivalent of 3 years of US undergraduate studies\". Now I'm caught in a bind where I can't seem to decide what to go for - should I just join the bachelors course or do the certificate course for game design at Full Sail?\n\nSeeing as how I've been struggling for a long time to try to break into the game industry, I really don't know what to do! I've been really looking forward to joining the relevant game design course ASAP, and break into the industry as well! Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

These are my reasons I know this sounds good but there 100% acceptance rate this means you can't get turned down sounds good? Employers can see that you went the there and you might have a hard time finding a job. Second is the cost.",

In any design field the things you produce are what will get you a job, they first look at your portfolio of work before even glancing at things like a resume or schooling so don\u2019t let that dissuade you from pursuing a design degree at somewhere like full sail. \ud83d\ude0b\n\nProbably best to talk to admissions about what would be the best course to take as far as joining a relevant course! They were super helpful with getting me on track to do a game design masters program next year",

            "comment": "The best thing you can do if you want to break into the game industry is to make indie games. Work with a small group to make simple and interesting games. This will beef up your portfolio if you really want to go into the triple A scene. I would recommend getting some game engines like Unity or Unreal and editing the code of the engines with your programming knowledge. \n\nI attended FS and graduated and like many others that went to that school didn't do anything with the degree. Most of the people I know graduating from the game design programs either burnt out, or gave up trying to get a job. The more successful ones went back to college for computer sciences at another university.",

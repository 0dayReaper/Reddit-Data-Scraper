    "postText": "So I took a break from school to work and just reentered this month, fullsail has taken since late December to certify my student loans even though they said they already approved them. I know it's busy this time of year but how long did it take for anyone else's to get certified? \nWe only went this route cause I already paid off a big chunk of school and need the money to help with cost of living while I finish my program, but I am starting to get worried they're gonna take another month or two and we'll be SOL with only my partner working.",

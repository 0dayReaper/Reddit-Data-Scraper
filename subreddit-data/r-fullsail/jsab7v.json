You can probably get out of the English and Math classes if you speak to an advisor and if you want to, you should get that done ASAP.  The psychology class is likely completely different from one you may have taken elsewhere, so, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019d let you skip that or not. I recommend taking it anyways.  Creative Presentation and Psychology of Play were the first two classes and were both fairly easy.  The current class I\u2019m in is Technology in the Entertainment and Media Industry.  It is also fairly easy, but, the work load is quite a bit more than the first 2 classes.",

    "postText": "I'm considering an education in Game Art at FS, but because of certain things, I can only do online classes. I've never looked into online classes before, but are they set at a certain time ? Because I have a (mostly) full time job that I'm at until 3pm every day (AZ time). I really want to go into Game Art classes, but my job is making it really hard, and I'm not financially stable enough to quit or change my hours.",

            "comment": "I'm going for my BS in Computer Animation but the Game Art and CA students are in the same classes for the most part, so I can shed some light on this.\n\nThe first four classes (less if you have some gen ed transfer credits like I did) are super easy and honestly won't take much more than 4 hrs a week to complete. Once you get into your first 3D Foundations class, though, that changes \n\nFor example. In 3D Foundations (this is the first degree specific class you'll take) you have like 2 or 3 practice exercises and then have to block out I think 5 different objects and turn them in as a scene. This is your introduction to maya. You most likely WILL have to research on Lynda by yourself, and it is suggested that you do.\n\nI spend on average 25 hours a week on class and then  I also work 35-40 hours. It's not \"hard\", but you just have to set yourself up the right way. Having the willpower to stop binging on Netflix and playing video games is a big part of online classes. If you can't see yourself practicing good time management skills then you may want to consider some other option and/or school\n\nAny specific questions you may have, feel free to Message me ",

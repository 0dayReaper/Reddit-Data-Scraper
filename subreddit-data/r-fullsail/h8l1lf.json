It's supposed to be, just like the military to weed out the ones that aren't really passionate about it. Unfortunately this can also work against it, making good people into tyrants and it destroys those who need just a bit of help to pass but can't get it. Hopefully you'll have the spirit to see it through and not much will change about your personality, one thing is for sure, time will tell. (I am a graduate)",

Full sail is much more expensive. 75k starting then every degree adds between 5-10k more. 40 hour a week schooling which means you are either living with parents or have to take out a loan from them for rent since its close to impossible to work and do schooling with them. But if money isn't an issue then fullsail isn't a bad option.",

I tried different colleges on and off over the years but would lose all motivation in just a few short months. I started my bachelors in graphic design with full sail back in July of last year, and my GPA is currently sitting at a 3.9. If you put in the work, you can definitely do it. Full sail is no joke though. Sure, the first few classes are crazy easy, and you can do it while juggling a full time job, but as soon as you get into your degree specific classes, you won\u2019t get a lot of time to yourself. You will have huge projects with fast deadlines, and you don\u2019t want to be one of those people who slack off constantly and either forget to turn in assignments or turn in the bare minimum and fail out after a few months. \n\nAll of this considered though, I would recommend looking into community college first, and take some gen ed courses. You need to be absolutely sure this is what you want to do with your future because for one, full Sail is expensive, and two, it\u2019s only meant for you if you want to really develop your passion. If you\u2019re still going back and forth on what you want to do, it\u2019s not the place for you. I\u2019m currently having this issue because even though I\u2019m succeeding in my classes, I\u2019ve lost the motivation and passion for graphic design. I\u2019ve been researching it, and hearing from other alumni\u2019s and a lot of them recommend not attending for certain degrees because you can teach yourself the same stuff and not owe all that student debt. I took a couple months off to kind of figure everything out and I think I\u2019m going to withdraw and focus on finding my actual passion or something that I enjoy enough to do and that I can make money doing. You\u2019re still young so you have plenty of time to figure it out. You don\u2019t have to have it all decided before you graduate and there\u2019s also nothing wrong with working for a year after high school before going to college. Everyone\u2019s path is different so don\u2019t feel discouraged if you don\u2019t have it all planned out immediately. \u2764\ufe0f",

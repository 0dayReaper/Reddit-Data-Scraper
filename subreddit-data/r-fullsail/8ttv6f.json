    "postText": "Hello everyone, I'm interested in attending online classes for Game Art. I was doing classes at ITT Tech before they closed and I didn't have any issues as far as time requiements. I work full time and have a wife and daughter. Does anyone have any experiences they can share about the Game Art online program? Any info or advice would be greatly appreciated and thank you in advance.",

My husband is taking online for a bachelors in mobile gaming, and is having a really rough time juggling both. It really depends on the classes, and the level of knowledge you have coming in. It's definitely doable, students juggling both walk across the stage at every graduation, but you've got to be willing to really grind. ",

I knew alot going into that though so it took about a year and a half before I learned anything new. I took alot of art classes in highschool and draw alot in my spare time, that's why I was thing going to Fullsail for game art. I hear alot of classes don't really do enough when it comes to computer coding and you have to learn it on your own, is that true? I don't I'll be coding much in game art but I'm curious. Thank you for the info \ud83d\ude01",

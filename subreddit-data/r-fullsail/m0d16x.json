    "postText": "I'm currently a Junior in high school, and I currently major in art, and I want to do something creative for a career; Any of which suit my interests, (in preferential order), music production, digital art/design, photography &amp; 2-d animation. I've been doing internships in my summers throughout high school so far, and plan to continue doing so. Considering I've seen FSU hits all of the aforementioned majors, I figured I'd go here and ask a few questions.\n\nA. Do you think any of the programs related to my above interests are worth going for?\n\nB. I haven't seen a seen literally anything about core classes at all, are they a thing at FSU?\n\nC. Any other majors maybe I should consider based on my above interests?\n\nD. If maybe it doesn't sound like Full Sail may not be a good fit, are there any other colleges I should consider?\n\nAny responses are greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "A) Yes, there are lots of relevant programs at Full Sail. I think the biggest hurdle will be just picking one that you want the most. \n\nB) There are core classes and you get them out of the way pretty early on. Physics, Math, English, etc. They are all pretty basic.\n\nC) I think what you have is the best to start with. No reason to flood you with too many options. Your student advisor might have a pretty good grip on what fits for you, though. It's hard to gauge from a single reddit post. \n\nD) Columbia Southern is a decent school that offers remote classes, too. I prefer Full Sail, but cost is a major deterrent for a lot of folks. Please understand what you're getting into with the Financial Aid team and all. Don't expect that a good job will help you clear it out, go in knowing the risks of lending. A lot of younger folks don't realize this when they jump into ANY university.",

            "comment": "A) Yes. I think the Music Production course may have some of the biggest success stories out there. One of the grads for music production was the sound mixer on W.A.P. (FullSails Instagram account regularly posts when grads win Grammys, Emmys, etc.) \n\nB) The core classes are all catered to your degree. So you take English, but the assignments relate to your field. You take psychology, but it\u2019s catered to creative mindsets, etc. the first 16 months include most of your core classes, usually with a different name than a traditional school. The course catalog lists them all.\n\nC) I\u2019d talk to the admissions department! They can send you info on all the programs, and tell you what most alumni are doing with the degree. I wasn\u2019t sure what program would be best for film editing, I just wanted it to be online. Then they mentioned they have people who graduated in Digital Cinematography that\u2019s are film directors (my crazy but more desired dream job), so I went for that! \n\nD) It depends on what you\u2019re looking for. I don\u2019t know of any other music production schools, but I vetted a lot of film schools before picking FullSail. I needed to be able to do it fully remote (I work full time), I wanted my teachers to have actually worked in the field before (I think FS requires 4 years minimum before allowing someone to teach a class, at least in DCBS), and I wanted legit equipment to work with (props to Launchbox!). I haven\u2019t found another school that does that\n\nAlso, side note, this school was 110% prepared for online classes before everything switched to hybrid/online. Classes are super easy to navigate, and you can easily access materials on your phone. Another perk - I can do homework will riding in the car. You\u2019re not losing out on educational value because things are online.",

            "comment": "It looks like you have a couple of good answers from other people, but, I just wanted to add that they do not offer a program for 2D Animation.  The Animation program is completely geared towards the 3D environment.  While, I think it may help you develop 2D animation skills, if that would be your desired career path, there must be other schools available.  However, if animation interests you, 3D is probably going to open up an easier career path for you.  I am in Computer Animation, it\u2019s a lot of work on top of my full time job, but, what I\u2019ve learned so far has been completely worth it.",

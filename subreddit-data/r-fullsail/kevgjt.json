    "postText": "I'm in game design bachelor's and I am in capstone. I failed the first class and now I am worried we will fail again. One of my teammates withdrew, one gave up and stopped working or responding. Me and one other guy are working very hard so that we can pass by a hair. What happens if we fail. I would have failed this class twice if I fail today. My husband and I have no job due to covid and I'm afraid I'll have to pay for a third attempt or worse be kicked from the program.",

Dig some digging they have had a class action lawsuit a few years back because students alleged of fraud and false advertising practices. Which I believe because I went to sign up they couldn\u2019t tell me up front how much it would be but it literally says 95,000$ on there website for animation (what I want to go into) I would suggest searching somewhere else it\u2019s just way too shady. \nGo for a non profit school.",

Seek pro\u2019s in you\u2019r field. They\u2019ll likely have answers to your unique questions and concerns. \n\nBest of luck",

If you want to break in the industry, then you got to start at the bottom and just work your tail off. People in the industry could care less about a degree, it's more about the portfolio of work. So, yes, go get a job instead and you'll thank me later.",

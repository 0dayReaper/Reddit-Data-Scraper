    "postText": "Hey everyone,\nObviously there are Full Sail horror stories out there, but I\u2019m trying to decide between Full Sail\u2019s online Game Art program and SNHU\u2019s online BA Game Art &amp; Development degree. If anyone is familiar with either or both of these programs I\u2019d appreciate some insight as to why you chose one or the other. \n\nFrom what I gather, Full Sail seems to put a lot of emphasis of developing your portfolio, while SNHU is an accredited university with an actual degree. \n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Let me start with this: I was not in the game dev program. I got my degree in cinematography, so I can\u2019t speak on that from personal experience. I\u2019ve also never taken a class at SNHU, because they didn\u2019t have a film program. That said, I played on the PUBG team with a couple guys in the games program and never heard a complaint from them. \n\nAs a whole, Full Sail is a good school. It\u2019s not nationally accredited for some reason, but it is locally accredited with Florida universities. Some teachers are better than others. You get out of it what you put into it. Do I think the piece of paper with my name on it is worth the debt? Eh. But the equipment I got, the connections, and the set of mentors that I can contact at any time are pretty invaluable. \n\nAgain, I can\u2019t speak for the game dev program or SNHU, but if you have other questions, you\u2019re welcome to DM me.",

It is *not* regionally accredited, as that's the more difficult accreditation to get.\n\nThere's a number of reasons the school is not regionally accredited, but a big one is that it can't have classes during \"normal\" hours. I think regional accreditation requires classes can't run any later than 10 PM.\n\nThe school has a lot of classes that rely on specialty rooms for labs, and so many students, that these rooms need to be open pretty much 24/7 to run all the labs.",

            "comment": "Funny enough I went to both schools, though for wildly different degrees. I got my bachelor in game design at Full Sail. I wanted to get a graduate degree in computer science but absolutely no schools would honor my undergrad because of Full Sail's accreditation. So I ended up getting an MBA from SNHU. \n\nIn my opinion they're both good schools, but SNHU is more of a school than Full Sail. Full Sail is kind of like a resume/network grower I'd say. To be fair I went a long time ago and they programs may have changed. It was very largely what you make it. You have to be very proactive, grow your network. I got a good experience from Full Sail but got a better education from SNHU.",

It just seems that a lot of (if not all) US-based engineering graduate schools do not recognize degrees earned from nationally accredited schools as actual degrees. \n\nProbably some political thing or something that's googlable. I think it's really only a problem if you want to or think you might want to get a graduate degree in engineering (maybe other) fields. If you do, you do not want your undergrad coming from a nationally accredited school like Full Sail. SNHU didn't care when I went for my MBA, whereas the five state schools I tried for an MS in computer science wouldn't even review my application.",

I did take some classes at SNHU and although the classes themselves were not difficult and the set up was good, I ended up with classes that made no sense. I had transfer credits and with their program would not have seen an actual class dealing with art in anyway for over a year. I decided to try Full Sail and am very happy. I like the pace and set up of their program. Platforms are easy to use and it works for me. Now, that\u2019s just my experience and opinion. I\u2019d look into graduation and hire rates, find other reviews online more specific to your desired course studies and speak to both school, look at timing and cost.",

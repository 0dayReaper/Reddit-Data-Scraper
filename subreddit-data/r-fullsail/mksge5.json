So I\u2019m wondering if I should quit before I attend FS on campus so that I can more fully focus on my degree and personal projects that I could potentially make money off of. So I\u2019m wondering if I should try to make money off of projects I make during my time at FS vs try to split my attention between FS classes, my part-time job, and then try to fit in personal projects in my spare time.\n\nAlso, money isn\u2019t a huge problem for me in the short-run since I\u2019ve been able to save up, so I\u2019m trying to find the best option for long-term.",

            "comment": "If you're able to financially, I highly recommend quitting the part-time job when you start. I was able to do that for the full time I was at FS and it made a huge difference. Was able to focus 100% on classes and projects. Then towards the end was able to focus on personal projects and a couple small freelance jobs (that paid just a little), but that outside-of-class practice helped me a ton.\n\nI loved my time at FS a lot because I had ~2 years to 100% focus on getting a solid foundation. I look back on that a lot still ~15 years out.\n\n(2006 Digital Arts and Design Grad)",

I\u2019m going into the game development course myself and I\u2019m glad to know that people are actually able to have time to work on personal projects outside of school time. \nYou said that you started working on freelance and personal projects towards the end of your degree. Is that because you just have more time to do so towards or end or were you just more comfortable doing work in your field around that time?",

Personally, I think it helps to go focus on your classes, but some people in my degree and very highly skilled in what they do, so they seek part time employment to make a bit of cash and help the time go by without being bored.",

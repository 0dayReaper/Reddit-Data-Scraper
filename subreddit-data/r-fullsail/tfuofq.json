            "comment": "The common denominator I see with a lot of the naysayers about Full Sail, is a few things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Many expect a traditional university experience, think they can party get away with slacking off and not being on top of things.\n2. Full Sail runs and functions much more like a vocational school than some 4 year uni.\n3. A LOT of the people I have come across making videos about their bad experience there tend to be projecting and making excuses about things.   And just from the videos I can clearly see excuses, Immaturity.\n4. Expect they will land a job making lots of money right away.\n5. Don't network.\n6. Have faulty expectations about what they're getting out of their program.\n7. Negative attitudes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the school is VERY expensive, yes.  and you have to adjust your expectations appropriately.   This isn't the place to go if all you're looking for is a slip of paper from an academic institution saying you did the thing.  This is the place you go to learn how do do a thing, and you will need a lot of self motivation to ask questions, get with peers for help, and how to research and learn things on your own time too.",

This isn\u2019t a bad thing, you just need to adjust and manage your time wisely. \n\nI would not have made it nearly as far had I not actually learned the skills needed to develop (coding). While FS ultimately wasn\u2019t for me, I disagree with much of the negative stigma the school is given. You put in the work, you will graduate with the tools needed to thrive. That work isn\u2019t just in the actual school assignments, it\u2019s networking, preparing yourself for the real world, etc. \n\nLastly, I transferred for a few reasons.  Mainly I grew out of my program and needed more. I also had several very negative experiences in rapid succession that are unrelated to the traditional negatives you hear about the school. \n\nThat being said I\u2019ll close with this.. do I recommend the school? Hell yeah. Look, not everyone is a spring chicken that can drop whatever they are doing to go to a four year brick and mortar. This school was there for me at a time in which I needed to further my education while maintaining everyday life, including a 50 hour work week. \n\nI truly believe you get out what you put in here at Full Sail. \n\nTake that for what you will.",

The school is designed to teach you the techniques of the industry and then help you build a portfolio of work to represent your ability. It is not a traditional college, and it will very much eat you alive if you are not dedicated to the schedule.",

FS is too much money for the education you are getting. I'm not saying FS is a bad school, in which it's not, you will learn a decent amount and they have good connections, but the cost for a non regionally accredited college and curriculum is 100% not worth it.",

Furthermore, I'm in I'm in month 8 of DCBS and haven't received my expensive ass camera (which if we're being honest is one of the big reasons a naive high schooler would choose this program) and I was told I'd be getting it in month 4. Some of the courses were helpful in changing the way I think about things, but overall haven't been as challenging as I expected. I have clinical depression, anxiety, and adhd that causes me to slack off A LOT and I haven't left a course with lower than an A which is kind of alarming considering how much I was just struggling in high school. I'm really considering dropping out of this shit while I'm only in $12000 of student debt but my parents are attached to the loan and I don't want to cause extra financial trouble for them so I feel kinda stuck. Especially now that we have this whole accreditation thing going on (Who's going to pay attention to a bachelors if it came from a school that got some programs unaccredited for not meeting requirements?) I wish the adults that pushed this on me would've been more honest about the financial aspect of going to college.",

The degree program I was in was designed to teach you the bare minimum and throughout my entire course at Full Sail I was seeking help/knowledge elsewhere.\n\nI was reminded several times by my professors that if I truly wanted to be successful in my field then I would have to go above and beyond what I was learning in class. I quickly adapted to the learning environment and that mentality still sticks with me today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat said. Full Sail is not for everyone, nor is it a perfect school but you really need to have the self motivation and passion to be successful at it. If I could go back and do it again, I would change a lot of what I did. If you are able to be an independent learner then I would highly recommend Full Sail, in the end I did learn a lot from attending. I may not be as successful as I had hoped after graduating (a lot of this lies within my own faults) but I was able to free lance  as an artist with my degree, save up enough money and moved to Los Angles, in hopes that I can keep growing as an artist.",

By no means not doable tho a handful of days few 42 pages of algorithms I\u2019ve never seen . . . It is what I want to do tho and my passion drives rite thru the intimidating numbers or unknown factor is my school gonna teach me or just slap me with a YouTube lecture . Nah I\u2019ve actually emailed and held a live conversation zoom with my prof \u2014- FSU is def a university dedicated to promoting film and tech  so far so good fingers crossed for a profitable 29 months",

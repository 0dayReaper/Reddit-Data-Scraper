It is mostly geared towards working on independent productions, and learning the aspects of filmmaking. I am not up to date on what comes in the launch box, but if you talk with an admissions rep, they can give you an exact breakdown. I do know that theres a macbook, camera, adobe cc, and lighting kit as of a year ago but it gets updated all the time. ",

Projects are usually pretty easy. If you can do the min requirements, you'll pass, but you won't learn that much. But if you put extra effort into it, network with classmates and on campus students, and take advantage of volunteer opportunities then I would say there's a very strong chance of being able to get any job you want. My roommate decided to take the online degree but live in Winter Park. That way he has a lot of time to volunteer and works in the Full Sail Live Venue and learns about live production too. It depends though, what aspect of film you after?",

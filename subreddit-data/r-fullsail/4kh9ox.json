    "postText": "Let me preface this by saying I dropped out and got my GED back in 09' due to some shitty circumstances, then went right to work, which honestly ended up working out well for me because what I wanted to go to school for I ended up realizing I never really wanted to do for a living, and I ended up finding a new passion in Lighting and Audio. \nI eventually became a DMX-Programmer and Lighting Tech for a Haunted attraction, however while I do have experience I still feel WAY under-qualified to even really be doing this, But I love it, I would also love to work in music, especially on live shows, so after a couple days of thinking, I figured what the hell Maybe i should go back to school, I mean better late then never right? \n\nso anyway questions:\n\nIs this degree here worth it? It seems to be the only degree of its type I could find. or should I attempt to find something elsewhere? If so what should I be looking into degree wise.\nOf course i have read the huge amount of negative reviews about this school from online aswell as the defense of it from graduates, So i would love to hear from both perspectives of students of Show Production.  \n\n\nIf i were to attend, I'm coming from out of state, and I don't exactly have a whole lot of money,  I know Full sail is a full-time commitment and that 12-16 hour days are not necessarily uncommon, but in attempt to try to keep loans a little lower...\nHave any of you balanced Work while attending?  if so any advice where to look? Does FS Offer any sort of \"student work\" type program for some extra cash?\n\none of the stock questions when requesting info via the website. \n\"Would I be able to take a break for personal or career commitments?\" figured I would also ask this here, Is this even a possibility? I mean If i was able to take a break to come home work for a month or two it would help me immensely for the question above this one..\n\n",

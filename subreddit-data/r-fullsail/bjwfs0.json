            "comment": "As an on-campus student, my perspective is vastly different than those strictly online. But all in all, I absolutely adore this program and the work we do. \n\nThere is a unique community that we foster that seems vastly unlike any other program at FS. I am currently about halfway through the program and all of my instructors have been amazing. Classes are very informative and relevant and offer unique opportunities to meld creative talent and conceptual knowledge. \n\nAs far as being an Art Director, I feel that this program is very well catered to that job description. We have a strong focus on marketing with respect to creative works. \n\nThere are folks in this program who have many visions of their career, some are working the social media endeavors of businesses and organizations while others are working directly with content creation and film. \n\nThe instructors come from a vast swaths of the industry and offer so much advice and meaningful help when it comes to career pathways as well. \n\nI\u2019ll put the contact details for our program director here as well. I\u2019m sure she can offer much more insight and answers to any questions you may have directly. \n\nBest wishes.\n\nMCBS Program Director Kathy Craven \nEmail: kcraven@fullsail.com",

So I\u2019m glad you likes this program and took the time to respond to me. \n\nAnother question, how is the workload with this program? Since I\u2019d be an online student, I want to make sure I\u2019ll have the time to complete classes all while working to support myself and school.",

Often times, the instructors can be flexible when it comes to assignment submission as well. I\u2019d say about 10-15 hours a week or so dedicated to working on assignments is a healthy estimate.",

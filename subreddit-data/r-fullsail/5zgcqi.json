    "postText": "Hi /r/fullsail:\n\nWe're a local start-up in the live-streaming video game space and we're in need of a design co-founder.  If you've heard of or ever used Twitch TV (www.twitch.tv) then you'll understand what that's all about.\n\nSpecifically we're looking for someone with a focus on UI/UX and, preferably, front-end web development abilities.  The front-end piece is negotiable but highly prefered.\n\nThis person would head up design and be very much an active participant in the direction of the product and the company.\n\nIf you're interested and would like to discuss in more detail just hit me up with a PM.  If you have a portfolio please feel free to link that up too.\n\nThanks!",

We're looking for someone to provide some direction in this role too, hence the position. Order takers are a dime a dozen and we want someone to lead in this position. I don't mean that to sound rude so please don't take it that way. Just being clear. \ud83d\ude00",

I have a proficiency with other languages, but those are the big web ones. \n\nDo you have funding situated? Or is it going to be more like a pet project until someone invests?",

The back end tech has been in development for a few years during which time we've refined to get market ready. \n\nIf you want to go a bit deeper just send over a PM. Appreciate your interest. ",

If I end up getting my schedule cleared I'll go ahead and send over my stuff.\n\nI literally just started Full Sail's Master program yesterday so I'm not entirely sure how much time I'm going to have. I'll definitely let you know if it works out on my end though, as I do feel I have a lot to offer!",

I was wondering does it offer any certification programs in tech like cyber security or computer science to get jobs. Usually everybody seems to mention that having a bachelor's is more suitable. And are there any requirements to get accepted like I just have high school diploma.",

I\u2019m over a year into the cybersecurity program and if you create a Comptia account and login with your school email you can get two free vouchers for certs. I\u2019m working for my CySA+ and Linux+ certs but there are tons offered. I dunno if they have talked to you about how the degree is broken down but first half is IT and you get an associates. Then the second half you can either continue down IT to get your BA or branch off to cybersecurity.",

Then they realize it is actually hard work and drop out. The tech degree programs have a higher graduation rate. Somewhere around 70% last time I checked",

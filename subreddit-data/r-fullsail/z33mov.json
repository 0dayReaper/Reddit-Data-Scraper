    "postText": "I\u2019m thinking about transferring to full sail from dalton state college bc I like being able to focus on learning one or two classes at a time. I also like how it\u2019s online so I could focus on other things in life rather than cramming five classes in one semester. I\u2019m one of those people that get unmotivated around the second half of the semester, so I think this will be a good change of pace. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anyone that is getting the bachelors of digital marketing at full sail? I just want to hear advice and your experience doing it :) I was majoring in marketing at dalton state college but I don\u2019t like doing it in person.",

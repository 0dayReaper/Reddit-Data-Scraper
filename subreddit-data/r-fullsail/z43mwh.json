    "postText": "Hey, I\u2019m really looking to go to full sail for a sports casting degree but at this time I can\u2019t afford to move down to winter park and pay for school. I was curious on people\u2019s opinion on the online portion of the sports casting class. Is it worth it? Do you feel like it prepared you for a career in the industry? I\u2019m truly dedicated to going into the sports media field as it is what I want to do with my life and this does seem like the best option. Really just want some feedback from current students and alumni on the online portion of the degree",

The teachers don\u2019t know you and they don\u2019t care to know you. Also it\u2019s not actually accredited so if you ever want to transfer none of your credits that you way overpaid for will come with you. You will have to start over. Ever considering and attending the school was such a horrible idea. Stay as far away as you can from Full Sail. It is a SCAM.",

Four of their programs are under warning from the accreditation body.\n\nIf your instructors don't know you, that's because you haven't reached out, and that's going to be the case at every university.\n\nWelcome to being an adult: instructors aren't here to hold your hand through each class. Not when they have ~90 students each month. If you want a relationship with your instructor you've gotta reach out. Send them an email the day before class starts, respond to their feedback on your assignments, give them a reason to want to get to know you.\n\nI'm sorry your experience at Full Sail was so shitty that you've decided to spend your free time convincing people not to attend. Hopefully you find something fulfilling to do with your time soon.",

Don\u2019t patronize me by saying \u201cwelcome to being an adult.\u201d I have more than fulfilling things to do every day I just decide to take a small portion of my day to help earn other and keep them from making a fatal mistake.",

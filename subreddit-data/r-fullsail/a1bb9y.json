Or atleast if so, possibility to get a higher certification?\nI also wanted to know some thoughts on what people thought about the classes and fullsail in general. \nI graduate 2019 and I\u2019m planning on starting in September. \nI know I\u2019ve heard that time management would be a bigger issue, but how many hours do you usually spend either doing classwork or while attending the classes themselves?\nI already know I\u2019m probably going to be paying it off for quite some time even with financial aid.\nIf anyone knows any scholarships that\u2019d be awesome too.\nBut I do think its really cool that they send you the mac with all the stuff you need, and financial aid for me is atleast going to be able to pay for that all.\nAnd since I\u2019m such a hermit the thought of being huddled up in my room all day on the computer sounds grrrreat.\nAnyways any answers or comments would be super. :D",

As far as how much work is put in, I can\u2019t really tell you about other programs but I know in my program, it started out easy around 10-15 hours a week, to know I am putting in over 30-40 hours a week in between lectures and assignments. It is basically the same as having a full time job. Just remember the more work you put in the more you get out of the school.",

You could do your week of work in a night, if not a couple hours. Be prepared to get kicked in the shins with a greater workload soon. Not saying it's a bad thing, but just be prepared.\n\nMind you, there are a few easy classes sprinkled in, but the school tends to pile those easy classes on top of a class that needs time put into it as well, essentially taking two classes at once.",

I take Game Art online, got about a month and half until I graduate, and the last year and a half has been torturous with the workload. I would say look at your upcoming classes and expect hell on your first core class.",

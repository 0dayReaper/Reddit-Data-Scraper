            "comment": "A couple of things:\n\n1) The debt question is one you'll face at most any college. There are grants and scholarships available if you're willing to do the work and hustle to stay on top of writing the essays and filling out the paperwork for them. At Full Sail, due to the accelerated nature of the programs, staying on top of this will be more challenging than at a typical university. Debt can be managed and prioritized after graduating, and if you get work, are otherwise frugal, you can make headway on your debt. Unfortunately that's become the reality of life for many, many people. There isn't good advice here. Taking on debt is *always* a risk and it's good you're thinking of the life-long impacts of taking out large student loans.\n\n2) There is no way anyone can tell you with certainty that Full Sail, or any college, will be \"worth it\", or if it's the right place for you. I can't speak to on-campus programs (more on that later), but my impression is very much that at Full Sail you'll get out proportional to what you put in. Show up ready to work your ass off, learn a lot, push yourself every day, and make connections with your classmates and instructors and you'll be much more likely to find success than the students who just do the work required to pass and not much more.\n\n3) Full Sail has two bachelor's \"film\" programs. One is on campus, one is online-only. I'm in the online \"Digital Cinematography\" program and I'm about 6 months from graduating. **This is not a typical film program.** You'll learn how to make short films and documentaries and commercials. But it's very, very based on solo and freelance shooting. You will not learn set etiquette or really be prepared to walk onto a sizeable production (except for entry-level positions). I can't speak to the campus degree, aside from what I've heard from classmates who have transferred onto campus, and they say it's much more large production set focused.\n\nPersonally, I think there are advantages to Full Sail. Many colleges have film programs that are masters degrees, meaning you won't start until after your undergrad. Many film programs require a reel or other submission as part of the application. Full Sail is happy to accept you and your money whether you're talented or not.\n\nBut look into the instructors of the program you're thinking about. Do they have connections with the kind of film work you're interested in doing? Do they have connections with studios you'd want to work in? Do they work in reality TV, big Hollywood shows, network sitcoms, documentaries? A huge value of going to school for film is the built-in networking opportunities. Research that, and if you like what you see, take the plunge.",

The instructors so far have all been very helpful, the customer service not so much, sometimes it's really hard to get in touch with an financial or international advisor or anyone,  technical support is very good. If you have any questions let me know.",

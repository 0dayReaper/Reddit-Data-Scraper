    "postText": "Hello, I just started my online Bachelor's in Information Technology on 8/1. Does anyone know if Full Sail sends a refund check for any leftover financial aid, and if they do when would they possibly send it out? Also, does anyone know when I should expect my Project LaunchBox Ipad and Macbook? I'm just curious to know since my laptop is about to give out on me.\n\nThank you &lt;3",

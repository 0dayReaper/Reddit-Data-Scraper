    "postText": "Hello, I appreciate anyone\u2019s insight! \n\nI am considering the certification program to enhance my music production skills and increase my chances of landing an entry level job in the music industry. I have been creating music for nearly 10 years and I am confident in what I\u2019ve managed to learn throughout the years. Education is constant and I have no doubts that I am in need of learning more. My point is simply, I am not a beginner.\n\nI am seeking insight from those who have either completed or will be completing this course. The following is assuming that I put in the work and that my talent is above average. How would a certificate help me land a job? Will industry leaders see this as a plus or will they overlook this? \n\nEssentially, I want to ensure that my money will be well spent. Again, I know I will put in the work. I\u2019ve been making music for nearly a decade and have never given up. My passion for music is stronger than ever before.\n\nThank you so much for all who provide insight! \n\nThis is my SoundCloud for those who wish to check out some work. https://soundcloud.app.goo.gl/X31XdcyrpXrFexEB7",

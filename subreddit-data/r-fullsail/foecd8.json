It\u2019s important to consider the price, though. There are a lot of available options when it comes to financial aid, though sometimes you have to go digging for it. I managed to cut down my 80k tuition to like 10k, so there\u2019s hope",

For me, the Pathway scholarship helped a lot and there are other options too. There are also some simple 500 word essays for scholarships.\n\nTalking to people on the phone who work for the school will help a lot because they recommended me things I had no idea about.",

The point of an education is to learn and gain real-world experience. If that\u2019s what you get then that\u2019s what matters. Full Sail isn\u2019t a medical school or anything, it\u2019s about art and media - industries that prioritize your portfolio more than anything else. Full Sail provides so many resources to students and offers a lot of financial aid that\u2019ll end up costing you less than other high-end universities. \n\nI think it\u2019s important to keep an open mind and put away biases before judging something that\u2019s different from the norm.",

            "comment": "\"For Profit\" is actually a tax status.  It means that Full Sail must pay taxes that non-profit schools do not pay.  It is run like a business, but that is seen more on the faculty and staff side than the student side, I think.    \nBe not deluded, the average State school, non profit as it may be, is all about money.  Student activity fees, ridiculous textbook fees, etc. etc.  Higher education is expensive all over.  The only difference is some programs at Full Sail are unique and exist nowhere else.",

This feeling won\u2019t last forever. Be strong with your inner dialogue. You\u2019re so much stronger than you know. \n\nHave you reached out to anyone around you or through your contacts? Answer some of your peers here to start a conversation. Try to reach out to anyone in your cohort yet? \n\nYou are not alone!",

The flood of negative thoughts does pass, and you will feel better. Sometimes you just need someone to talk you through it. I try to do that for my loved one with intermittent depression.",

Don't let people get you down because you are you not them. Sometimes you have to tell the world to f off because you are amazing and after Abit you realize it's true even if it's just a little bit. That's what I do I'm not sure if it will help. Talk to the student liasons and the school there's plenty to live for and you are worth living it.",

Full Sail isn't a forever thing. If you want to transfer, contact another school and go over the steps in how to do it.\n\nIf you feel alone, you can always drop me a PM and I'll chat with ya.",

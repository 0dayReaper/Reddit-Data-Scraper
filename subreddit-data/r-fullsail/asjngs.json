            "comment": "Short answer, no. I was an extended student during my time at Full Sail, and even with a more relaxed schedule, it was very difficult to not only find an employer who would work around the monthly changes in availability, but also just having the energy and time to work after classes.\n\nHowever, I did end up working part-time overnights at a retail store essentially as a stock boy, so it is possible to work and attend classes without affecting your grades. I graduated as salutatorian in my class (humble brag) and worked every time I could, albeit part-time.",

I lived a couple blocks away and, while not ideal, I worked at Gap...by Disney. So I would drive the long drive from Orlando to the store and worked from midnight to 7am a couple nights a week. It wasn\u2019t the best situation, but I did eventually get a much closer job at the Enzian theater in Maitland as a dishwasher and eventually a waiter. There are jobs to be found that will work around your schedule so long as you prove your worth and determination.",

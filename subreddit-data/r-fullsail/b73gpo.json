I chose Full Sail because I work full time and I am a single mother. Full Sail offers convenient scheduling around my already busy schedule. Your complaints about the recruiter aren\u2019t necessarily a reflection of the school itself. Your recruiter is doing his job. I would focus more on why you want to go into this industry. Also think hard about a plan after you graduate so that you don\u2019t waste your degree and money. I know a lot of success stories from graduates at Full Sail. Maybe the school isn\u2019t for you?

            "comment": "The workload varies depending on if you're on or off-campus. On-campus students usually take two courses per month which can be pretty hefty in workload depending on the classes (40/50+ hours).\n\nI'm an on-campus computer animation student that opted for the 'extended' program which spreads the classes out to one per month, much like the online curriculum. It depends on the class, but I've already probably put about 60 hours of work into my homework alone this month with still another 10-15 to go until I'm done. I have no idea how some folks manage two classes per month like this, I applaud them.\n\nFeel free to DM me or comment if you wanna know anything specific.",

Once 3D Fundamentals and Model Creation begin, it gets hectic (sometimes extremely hectic if you're not grasping the material), but very rewarding if you enjoy the medium and plan to work in the industry. I've been loving it.\n\nBest of luck!",

But generally, any month that involves modeling/animation will be more time consuming. \n\nLast month I was in Project and Portfolio 1 and had to model, UV, texture, light, and render an entire scene from a Pinterest image. My entire month was spent working on it, and I had to miss a day of work to meet my final deadline. On top of that the lectures/labs were required so I had to fit those in my schedule too.\n\nOn the other hand, my current class is Mathematics, and I literally spend 1 day a week working on my assignments. I haven\u2019t attended a single live lecture (not required). The assignments are just straight forward tests and they give you the calculators/tools to solve them. You can also retake tests multiple times, so getting a good score is easy.",

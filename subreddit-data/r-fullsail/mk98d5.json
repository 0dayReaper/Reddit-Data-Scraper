I\u2019m 17 and just wondering what I should be expecting.\n\nHow big is the difference from high school to Full sail?\nIs there in person learning or is it all remote?\nHow hard was it to get adjusted and or find friends\nWill I have time for a job?\n\nThank you in advance!",

            "comment": "I just graduated from FullSail on Friday from the game design program! I made a few friend I was an online student because I don't live in Florida and couldn't move. There are plenty of online events and team based classes where you can make great friend ships. Alot of communication is done through discord whether it be text voice chat screen share or face to face. The classes are one a month mostly (sometimes you have career classes that are easy and randomly you have two classes in a month.) They give you a launch box that contains a computer and other essential items. I got an hp zbook and it is the bomb. But this is my perspective from going online.\n I suggest watching Brackeys And DevSquad on youtube for Unity and unreal tutorials respectively. They help out alot and will give you a boost. SoloLearn is a great free app and website that will help you learn any coding language as well. This is really a great school the students and staff are very helpfu if you need help with anything they will one on one with you so don't be afraid to ask. I had a child mid school and still graduated while keeping in the honor society. That's not saying it's easy you go. many late nights. But it's worth it and I hope those youtuber and websites help you they helped me and I'll still be watching them because there is so much to learn and it's exciting to learn it! Good luck have a lot of fun!",

            "comment": "Hey there! I\u2019m currently on a 100% online program (not game design though). I\u2019ve never even seen campus and I\u2019m several time zones away. I work full time (sometimes up to 60 hours a week), and I do Full Sail full time. I think the online program definitely has the ability to juggle (I can\u2019t comment about on campus degrees, they\u2019re structured completely differently). I make sure to plan out each week on Monday, and if I have any questions on assignments, I send out emails by Thursday or Friday to get an answer before the Sunday deadlines. \n\nI do think it differs a lot from high school. You won\u2019t have any reminders to get your work done. You don\u2019t have designated \u201cclass time\u201d for assignments. A lot of the deadlines can seem like warp speed, but since you only have one (and very randomly two) classes, it\u2019s easier to manage fast turn arounds. I think it\u2019s great though, you get to choose what you want to do and when, and pick a schedule that\u2019s right for you. The first few classes include Psychology of Play, and it\u2019s a class that goes over time management and the best way to learn, all while relating to psychology. It\u2019s super helpful!\n\nEven though I\u2019m online, I still have made awesome friends. They live no where near me, but it\u2019s great to have classmates to talk to about school and career goals.",

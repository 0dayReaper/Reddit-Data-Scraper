    "postText": "First off, thanks for reading. I'm 31 and I've been in IT since 2009. I did many years of Help Desk followed by 18 months of software development in a largely .NET Agile environment. I ended up supporting existing applications much more often than doing new development and that's been an issue in finding a job since I left. That said, I really want to get into mobile development and am seriously considering doing the 20 month program. Are there any Mobile Development alumni out there that could tell me about their experience during and post school at Full Sail? I'd love to know your thoughts. Really, any alumni who are willing to share their experiences would be greatly appreciated, and thank you in advance for your input.",

            "comment": "Hi, I'm 3 months late to this post, but here it goes anyway:\n\nI am a graduate of the Mobile Development program (back when it took 21 months). I honestly think you would find the program pretty easy and enjoyable based on your past experience. I went into the program with zero scripting knowledge, a general interest in computers, and a decent amount of knowledge in networking (Cisco, IT, etc.). \n\nFull Sail assumes you have zero prior experience programming and will teach you the basics like var, ints, strings, and conditionals. Next, they teach (or taught) the basics of a language. For my class, it was JavaScript. Then, we went on to learn Swift, and then Java. I've heard they've changed the program quite a bit since I graduated, but I would definitely recommend it. It seems like one of the best degree programs at the school. \nI'd be happy to answer any questions you or anyone else might have about the program or the school in general.",

I guess the main thing I'm concerned about is hireability. Were you able to get a job you wanted right out of the program? Also, how do employers look at a nationally accredited degree vs. a regionally accredited degree, or do they even care? If you got a job, did you feel that Full Sail prepared you well for the work environment? How did you like Full Sail as a whole?\n\nThanks in advance for answering the questions -- I appreciate it!",

                            "comment": "I was able to get a job with $60k salary and full benefits doing exactly the type of coding I wanted (iOS-Swift) a month after graduating. I was given a few other offers in states that I didn't really want to work in, doing programming in languages that I knew, but I didn't enjoy (Android-Java). \n\nHonestly, any good employer won't care about where you went to school or whether it's nationally accredited (IIRC, Full Sail is nationally accredited). Some employers *will* care about your schooling, but don't bother with them. A good employer will analyze your actual ability to code and solve complex problems. This analysis (if truly thorough) shouldn't be in the form of trivia questions. These trivia questions are things like: \"What is wrong with this function?\" or \"What are the necessary methods for creating **X** ?\"\n\nI think Full Sail prepared me with enough knowledge to get me in the door of an unknown or not-so-popular company. If you're looking to get into a well-known company like Google or Facebook, you need to do **a lot** of programming work outside of class. Full Sail prepares to do pretty much anything in iOS and Android. The only potential drawback is that you are trained to be a \"jack-of-all\" developer. What I mean by this is that you'll learn and touch on most of the frameworks and principles required to do nearly anything in mobile. However, you won't focus on one specific expertise in classes. \n\nI chose to focus on the front-end side of mobile programming, but I had to do this outside of class, as both front and back ends were taught. Full Sail taught me the basics of things like view layouts and design, but I had to do a lot of extracurricular programming to learn things like keyframe animations and other front-end specific methods. Most students get jobs where they will be doing pretty much full-stack development, but I knew I wouldn't be happy unless I focused on one side or the other. Most job opportunities are looking for a \"jack-of-all\" mobile programmer, so I guess Full Sail will prepare you pretty well if that's what you want to do in the end.\n\nAs a whole, I really liked Full Sail. I had a lot of problems staying focused and doing my work in high school because the classes were so long and slow. Full Sail provided me with quick paced learning and rarely slowed down at all. Telling your family and friends that your classes are every day and about eight hours long is pretty fun because they're usually really shocked. Realistically, the eight hours seems like nothing because of the amount of information covered in that time. If you love to learn quickly, Full Sail is perfect. \n\nMy only issue with the school is how little attention the Mobile Development program receives. Not just in terms of advertising, but internally. The higher-ups are more concerned with programs like Game Development or Film, so Mobile Development receives very little praise. It's strange considering the graduates of the Mobile Dev program will most likely be the more successful when compared to those of Film or Game Dev.",

I just met him in the program director meet and greet yesterday and I appreciate anyone who is a no bullshit kind of person, and I can tell that you are, so thank you for that. I'm looking forward to getting started but definitely don't have any delusions that this degree track won't require digging into topics in my own time. We've got access to some really experienced and intelligent people and I'm excited to make the most of that. Thanks for the response!",

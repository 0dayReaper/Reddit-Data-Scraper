    "postText": "Hey guys, so I was an AI student until last year when they started closing every campus, and I transfered over to Full Sail's online department last fall. Fast forward to now, and financially I'm not even sure if I can continue. None of my credits transferred, and my old loans are still being discharged. However mother and her fiance don't want me to continue as they're afraid all these loans will ruin their retirement, despite my pleas it'll be fine. Here's my question,  if I drop out, do I have to return my launchbox products? I remember there being a grant that covers it as long as I graduate, but that's probably not happening, I've barely used any of it as I've mainly used my desktop for assignments and have really only tested out the Wacom and Scanner I got.",

That's the information given to me.",

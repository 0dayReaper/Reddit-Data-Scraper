    "postText": "Hey guys so I am going on a behind the scenes tour next month for game art and game design however i still cant figure out which of the two i wanna do. I told one of the staff at FS i enjoy 3d modeling (kinda played with it for awhile and had a blast) i also wanted to try animation however when going through the course guide i noticed i would have to take art 1 &amp; 2 now it wouldn't be so bad if i could actually draw however i am terrible. I can draw stick figures but thats about it would this be a terrible mistake for game art? My friend that attended full sail suggested i do game design but I think i am not all that creative which he says i have to be. I really really enjoy 3d modeling but im afraid i will struggle in the 2 art classes since i cant draw. After watching some of the review and fs promo videos for art 1 it discouraged me pretty badly. Would these classes be too difficult and or am i making the wrong decision by picking game art? ",

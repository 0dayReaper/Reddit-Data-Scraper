            "comment": "I'm currently finishing up an online digital cinematography degree. While I can't speak for the marketing and media specifically I can speak for the online format. \n\nFullsail gets a lot of flack and some is quite earned but fullsail does make it known that they push a fast paced and compressed curriculum. This is even more so true for an online degree. An online degree works by month. Each month you take a class. Each week of that class is used similar to half a semester of a school year. Once finished with that class you move on to the next. \n\nDoing online courses require a ton of discipline, as any schooling does, however online is done mostly from home on your own where laziness is easily tempted. Especially if you work full time as well. You will have go to meetings which work similar to lectures and you have access to your instructor through various means. However, if you do not apply yourself and are not willing to learn you won't really benefit in my opinion. It is very important to know that you are responsible for your education. The instructors are there to guide and answer questions but it up to you to seek the help and to learn. If you do that you will have a fantastic time and learn a ton. \n\nAlso be warned that the first few classes of online degrees are very \"core\" centric and can be pretty easy but once you start classes focusing on your degree it'll get ramped up. I've seen people fall behind cause they got used to the relaxed core classes then got hit with some major work in their degree specific ones. \n\nI hope I've helped and if you decide to apply welcome aboard!

You also receive some other programs and books throughout the course. The camera package, or technical Package, listed above is not sent out until right before you're about to start your major classes. ",

You have to apply yourself though as it is very easy to get lax since its online and there's no classes demanding your presence. If you can be self disciplined you'll learn a lot and walk away with a decent portfolio. ",

    "postText": "Hey guys! So I just started my junior year a while back. I\u2019m an online student in the music production degree. I feel like I\u2019m going through a rough patch where I\u2019m always second guessing myself and I\u2019m having a hard time finding my creativity and drive that I had when I started. \n\nI\u2019d really love to hear some of your experiences and see if anyone else has gone through this phase? Also if you have any advice I would greatly appreciate it!",

            "comment": "100% have felt this way lately! I\u2019m also a Junior, in Digital Cinematography (online). I felt that my first big Portfolio Project was a flop (although I\u2019ve been learning how to edit it better, and I\u2019m definitely been able to salvage it!), and really struggled to feel like I\u2019m creating anything worthwhile. \n\nI joined a lot of creative communities here on Reddit that align with filmmaking in some sort: screenwriting, picture forums, camera specific forums, video editing, producing, etc. I feel like it\u2019s really helped. I also followed creators on Instagram and Pinterest, just to be exposed to more and more ideas. \n\nI\u2019m trying to make more. Even if it\u2019s bad, just create. I made a video of how I took a picture, it\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s better than nothing. \n\nI\u2019m not familiar with what deliverables you can create in music production, but I\u2019d just create! Even if someone has already done it, create something inspired by them. Even if it\u2019s bad, even if it\u2019s the biggest mess of garbage you\u2019ve ever seen (or in your case, heard). Even if looking at it makes you want to throw away all your equipment and never touch it again. Eventually you\u2019ll create something cool or come up with a good idea!\n\nDoes that help? Also, on forums where there are professionals, they sometimes post good ways to stay creative daily! \n\nI\u2019d also be down to listen to any ideas/brainstorm with you if you\u2019d like! Feel free to PM me :)",

I think that may be part of the issue because I\u2019m not making anything that I enjoy yet, or more anything for myself.  \n\nSame goes to you, if you\u2019d like to share anything or need music for any of your videos, feel free to get ahold of me!",

I\u2019m not sure your prior knowledge of making music, but the degree would be a lot easier if you have some previous experience. Overall you get what you put in. It requires very strong time management and a willingness to learn outside of class. Being an online student you don\u2019t really get 1 on 1 time with your instructors and you don\u2019t get to know the students around you unless you put in ALOT of effort. \n\nI absolutely love the school, I really do. They do try to get you to be open and be yourself and they are ranked pretty good for the degree. It\u2019s kind of hard to have a job and afford a place to live while you do the work, so if you live at home I would really suggest staying there as long as you can. \n\nYour feedback from instructors is usually pretty limited so you have to have faith in yourself and your work. It is A LOT DIFFERENT than being in class with others where you can see their work and kind of get an idea of how your doing based on those around you.\n\nThe last thing I have to say is it is VERY music theory based. If you don\u2019t like music theory, the degree itself is probably not what you want and the school is DEFINITELY not where you want to go. But I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve done your research and know what you expect from the degree. Some people really struggle with this. But I will tell you if you decide to go to Full Sail, or even if you don\u2019t, if you have any questions, need any advice or even an opinion or pick me up, maybe some tutoring, I\u2019m more than willing to help where I can. \n\nI would give the school 4.8 stars in all honesty. I gave you most of my negative opinions because the reasons I love the school would take way too long to type. I wish you luck on your journey and I hope this helped/ made sense.",

Make friends, have conversations with your professors, and keep in touch. \n\n- Take it seriously and keep learning after the program is over. \n\n- Put yourself out there NOW as a professional in XXX field and try to pick up as many small gigs (or big ones if you land them) now.\n\n- Be selective in the work you choose to pad your portfolio, it's a representation of you. Don't be so selective that you miss out, just find the balance. \n\n- Take full advantage of the Alumni site, career development, and links the professors give you to job boards. Pay the fee for Duotrope (or wherever), put yourself on Fiverr or Upwork. Take. The. Job. It's worth the risk, trust me. \n\n- Dream about your career. Think about it while eating. Exhale and say \"I'm going to be XXXXX, I am xxxxx\" multiple times a day. If it is your passion, you need to let it become who you are. When people say your name, you want them to say \"Oh, comfortable-ad-8446? Oh yeah, he's a great podcaster/game dev/scriptwriter. Not much for table tennis, though.\" lol.\n\n\n- Really take on the [no zero days](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af/) mentality. \n\nthese fields are competitive. If you're even remotely on the fence about taking the next big step someone else will do it first. Mr. Mathers said it best \"mom's spaghetti\"...but also he said, \"you must seize the moment the moment you want it.\"",

But it requires a lot of effort on the student. Online is even more so. Our time with the instructors is even more limited than the Campus students and if you don't ask questions when the opportunity is given then you will be out of luck. Be prepared to do a lot of research outside of the information given. I love it so far, but I can see how some people can get lost easily and give up. These are FAST programs, and they demand 110% from the students.",

First, everything is set up into weekly assignments. Each class is 4 weeks long and I recommend making a weekly schedule to complete your assignments. Also, don\u2019t panic about the assignments my people. These professors are not out here to trip you up and ask confusing questions. What I mean, in traditional schools, you can be asked a question that has multiple right answers and only one is the BEST, other times the answers look similar to confuse you, all these little tricks are non existent in FSU. Hey if you know the answer, then you know. Why confuse a person right lol. Another good tip, fall in love with your iPad and mobile device. If you get used to working on them everyday, you will be able to multitask while completing assignments. What I mean is you can work faster by being able to look something up on your phone while working on your iPad, as well as take screen shots from both user and 3rd person perspective. Highly recommend to get an apple pen and use an App called Notability. Not only can you write hand written, typed, and convert hand written into typed, but it records your notes like a video. This is available when you use the audio record feature to let\u2019s say speak while taking your notes so that when you look back you can hear and see as you were writing/typing. Best of all, I have done this many times, you can watch your lecture and record the audio as the professor is speaking, while writing your notes, so when you go back you can hear the professor and you were writing down those notes. Oh and join the discord groups lol. Lots of ramble but it\u2019s worked for me. Good luck.",

Whether it be unity or unreal engine there are lots of tutorials on youtube that can help supplement your knowledge. Always look for new and creative ways to go about making your games (or what ever program you're in) I've seen lots of people leave for their associates only 3 months away from graduation. I know it's been a bad year but don't give up especially when you are so close to the end",

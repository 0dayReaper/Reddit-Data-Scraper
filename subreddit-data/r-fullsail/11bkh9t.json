            "comment": "Hey there,\n\nFull Sail did absolutely nothing for me. If you look at my post history, you can read more in-depth things i've said about their program for music, but i'll give you some of it here:\n\n- I didn't go to campus, I went online. Not sure if there is a difference but online was a joke.- Many of my teachers taught piss simple things with gusto and emphasis. Like how to run cables to a mixing desk. This would be something that energy went into and they knew how to teach without fear. Often teaching it and then bringing it up or teaching it again multiple times in the short time you spent with them. While this might be good for a legitimate newbie whos trying to get into pro audio for the first time. It's way better to go to google or youtube and search as that content is better and free. Lots of my courses even up until the end I felt were designed at the newbie in mind. Anyone with any knowledge of pro audio would\u2019ve felt like their money was wasted here more than anything. Not even getting to the fact they didn\u2019t help once graduation kicked in. - Many of my teachers didn't really care about the classes. They also didn't speak that great of English and were often bad at teaching more complex things. I know this is different in person, but Full Sail is not what it used to be in their audio department. The school has almost in my opinion gained a meme reputation. I\u2019ll get more on this later. Just like the teachers teaching my classes. The administrators were also on the same level of lack luster carefree coasting. None of them offered to do anything above and beyond. Doing the very minimal. Taking days and weeks to get things done. I knew it would reflect come post graduation. It did. They didn\u2019t even attempt to sit with me for my resume review which was supposed to be included. They told me mine already looked great. When I didn\u2019t even send it in. They told me a bunch of places to apply to and gave me links to websites to apply online. They told me to make sure I stated I was a Full Sail graduate. These places were in mostly two places. Hollywood, California and New York City, New York. I didn\u2019t want to move. Other options were major cities. Miami, Florida and Houston, Texas. Doing either live sound or some sort of audio related job for TV. I wanted to make music and work with Arianna Grande. Not check the volume of a boom mic on a broadway play, or make sure the volume was universally equal for TV commercials on a news channel. Regardless all the places I applied to even in other states didn\u2019t want to hire me due to location, or simply cause they weren\u2019t hiring at the moment. - When I attended Full Sail, I would finish coursework in a much faster time. I also did things my way in my DAW of choice as I had gone into this program with 5-6 years of knowledge and was able to do much more advanced things. When it came time to write songs for the final. I basically had an entire portfolio to present for assignments and all of it was pretty quality stuff. The other people in my class that didn't drop out within a few weeks, were constantly trying to collab with me for assignments hoping for easy grades. The students in my class were mostly all doing the same thing. Lots of people just ripping off rap artists. Copying beats, stealing samples, etc. As others will say \"you get what you put into it\", and I\u2019ve noticed that most people don't put anything into it and expect results. However, when you do put results in you get the same outcome. It's a solid 5/10 for the school and what they offer at best, at least in production/engineering for pro audio. In the 90s. Easily it was a 10/10. Times changed and this entire field changed drasticly with it. Full Sail knows that and still tries to sell you a degree. - When I graduated, I got made fun of constantly and also pitty laughed at when I pitched my resume to places. In fact, I had more people sadly wish they could offer me an internship for the simple fact they felt bad that I spent money to go to Full Sail. Yet I never got an internship or anything like that because of Full Sail.\n\nEventually down the road when I pitched my resume of having 3-5 years of experience doing stuff by myself, I got excepted into an internship for a rather popular studio in my state that did 100 or so really popular records in the late 80s, 90s, and early 00s. During my internship there, the lead engineer (not saying his name) said if he knew I went to Full Sail he wouldn't have hired me.\n\nI'm gonna be honest, almost all my success in music, and engineering, and production has come from myself and myself only. Which granted while isn't a lot. Like I don't have gold or even silver records sales. I've made money to feed myself and my family, and enjoy my hobby of buying expensive outboard gear.  Overall, music production is one of those careers that you just get lucky in, right place right time, or have enough hype and buzz that people notice you because your music rocks. Youtube, soundcloud, and tiktok are all outlets that are going to do more for you than any school will ever do. You don't need school for it.\n\nAll said and done, I spent $55k+ to get absolutely nothing out of Full Sail and actually helped teach their teachers different things. I'm 32, I went to Full Sail 12 years ago, and the only thing I have is a .PDF of my degree that sometimes I forget is on an old flash drive in my junk drawer somewhere in my storage closet.   \n\n\nI hate saying this, cause I'm not trying to brag or anything I just want you to know that Full Sail doesn't mean anything in terms of accomplishing goals. I do have my own studio, which I had two years before I went to Full Sail, it's just more rounded now due to the fact im an adult with adult money. I do content creation now, and teach the same stuff that Full Sail tries to teach and I don't charge for it.   \n\n\nFeel free to hit me up and ask me any other questions. I'll be glad to help you if I can.",

Out of all of us who graduated, only a handful still work on the industry. Some enjoyed some success, one was even an engineer in Brittney Spears records, but he got disenchanted with the industry quickly and moved back to his home state and runs a boat dock on a lake. He seems much happier now, and I\u2019m happy for him. \n\nBut, yeah, ultimately any of our success was our own doing rather than the school. \n\nI got out of the industry early on, went back to a four year in-state university and got a degree in computer engineering, which worked out really well for me.",

I\u2019ve had people combat responses like this because they were told Full Sail is the same as Harvard or Yale for music and video production and I just giggle. I truly feel at one point. It was absolutely credited. Now it\u2019s not and has fallen off. \n\nI feel like Full Sail talk is a bunch of old timers at a bar talking bout\u2019 the good ol\u2019 days. \n\nOnly of my tech bosses from a job a few years back went in 91 and he worked on a Matchbox 20 album and did some stuff with Barry Gibb as a solo artist. He now helps build studios as a side gig and does construction for sound design. 99% of his clients are churches. He said he still wanted to do something with music and jumped to that but in my opinion it\u2019s not even close. You could tell he was depressed but as he said several times \u201cmixing and producing doesn\u2019t pay the bills anymore\u201d. \n\nWe live and an age where you can go to guitar center or sweetwater with $200-500 buy an interface and some monitors. Download a cracked DAW and some vsts off the internet and make a potential top 40 hit. Something you don\u2019t need school for. Something you don\u2019t need a studio for. Something you don\u2019t need management for. Something you don\u2019t need a label for. Just you and your ideas in your head coming to life in your room. Making things happen. \n\nThe age of digital has gotten pretty close to analog in most emulations now. While my studio is mostly analog and I mix outside the box. I know a ton of top 40 singles that were done on an Apollo Twin in the back of a tour bus using UAD plug-ins and fabfilter pro q only. \n\nI think the 2010s were ultimately at that point where everyone wanted to go digital and the phase out of analog was truly where a lot of smaller studios just couldn\u2019t keep up. Every week on Craigslist I saw \u201cstudio closing sale\u201d and I got lots of gear cheap. Even the big studios in my home state. Including the one I interned at that did 100+ gold records closed it\u2019s doors during the pandemic. \n\nThat\u2019s why I do content creation and mix and master on the side. I\u2019m getting my fix of turning knobs and making records come to life and enjoy every second of it. I enjoy helping people learn about these things and get passionate about outboard gear. Tech is going to pay more in every single path than music will no matter what really but doing it as a side hustle is absolutely worth it.\n\nUnless you get super noticed or output the level of hustle and grind that most people don\u2019t have to go above and beyond. You\u2019re going to be in the same spot as everyone else. Doing this for fun and as a hobby in hopes you\u2019ll be the next big thing. You\u2019re just wasting your money at Full Sail either way though.",

Does no one question why they do that?!? It's one reason and one reason only...to make more money. More volume = more money!! I also hate when people say, 'You get what you put into it'. Yes, that is true for literally EVERYTHING in life. I was a straight A student who did the long night labs and busted my ass out of school, and ended up with a very mediocre job at a Post House that I could've easily gotten if I didn't even got to Full Sail. I suppose these are lessons learned, but I didn't have the luxury of looking up reviews online back in 1994.  I learned about Full Sail through a family friend, and then Full Sail sent me mailers and called me every day to get me to come to Orlando. I was young and dumb, so I can only fault myself for falling for their marketing hype. But, I'm still blown away in this day and age, how many people are still choosing Full Sail.

                            "comment": "The whole point of my post is to explain that a degree from Full Sail means absolutely nothing within the Audio Engineering community. That it's a waste of money and time. I knew 5x more than what was being taught before I went to the school, and didn't learn anything at all from the program that I didn't already know. As I mentioned it was a lackluster experience and the program was not good. You get a degree at the end that won't mean anything regardless of what you know.  \n\n\nWhen it came time to look for a job and try to find something the only places that Full Sail helped pitch my application too were in major cities around the US. This was circa 2012. So Miami, Houston, New York, Los Angeles, maybe Philly? They were for doing live sound either setting up microphones for orchestras, and live performance venues, or doing mixing on a broadcast for live TV, at one of the big centers they were partnered with. No one wanted to hire me, because I lived in New Haven, Connecticut. They didn't want to pay for relocation or take a chance on me since most of the jobs had high turnaround rates. I applied to 100+ of their offered/suggested positions and all of them came back as nothing. Most people stated it was a location thing. I was hoping that they would follow through with their \"we'll get you a job in a pro studio\" promise that they bragged and boasted about.  \n\n\nI had my own studio, and my own studio was making me more money than what even the minimalist position from Full Sail would've offered and to further dive into that point  I was mixing stems making way more while I was getting my degree then I did after I graduated. At the end of the day it's just a piece of paper that said i had a \"skill\", even though I already had that skill and was already doing it.    \n\n\nSo my expectation was to spend $55k on a degree, which would yield me at least $55k a year in money. Because I was told having a degree from them would get me the job of my dreams. I was told then when I graduated that stupid piece of paper would be awesome in the eyes of people who otherwise wouldn't of hired me without it. I was told upon graduation, i'd be handed a role that would have that amount of money AND MORE as audio engineers were in demand. Which all were lies and marketing tactics. While I still do have a studio, and a successful youtube channel teaching what I was teaching before I even went to Full Sail, which is a great chunk of change that allows me to buy really expensive gear and enjoy life. I primarily work in coding now, and make way more than any full time audio engineer that isn't famous would ever make. Which is really sad.",

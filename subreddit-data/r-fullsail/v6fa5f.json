Who knows who they will make a videogames for next.\n\nI just want to know how hard it would be on a scale of 1-10.\n\nYou can give as much details as you want.",

The creative writing program or working for Insomniac Games? \n\nThe program difficulty is like any other: it's not hard if you put the work into it (but this scales based on knowledge and ability to learn and adapt, as with any educational program). \n\nWorking for Insomnia Games is probably a bit harder, as it's more competitive. Dedication, persistence, and hard work go into finding an industry job like that, and the ability to widen your scope (starting as a game writer might not be available, but starting as Cheif Granola Bar specialist might be, to get your foot in the door).",

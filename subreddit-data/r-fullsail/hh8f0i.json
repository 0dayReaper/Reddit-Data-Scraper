I would also tell you to really look into the animation industry and how hard it is to break into. I got an internship at a small studio right after college but I was never able to get into the field after. I applied to studios all over the US for 2 years before I gave up. I had a decent character animation demo reel that I shouldn't of had any problem getting an entry level position anywhere. I have been paying $1,000 a month in student loans since. This shit is real and people really need to understand the industry or at least have connections in the industry before they go to this school.",

I don't want to be presumptive about your schedule but you could learn game art in your free time. I'm getting a media communications degree but in my free time I've been studying graphic design. Having a degree will get the door open and from there you can show that you know how to do other things as well.",

The computer science degrees are the same. I was in game development and switched to simulation and visualization about 10 months in. So you can start with one, and you may decide a few months in, you're more interested in the other one.",

I start classes at the end of October so hoping 10 months after that they adopt these cameras and I get sent one. \ud83d\ude4f One thing I\u2019m worried about is since they are a sister school to LAFS if they are going to do what they did and drop the FS5 in order to start sending BMPCC\u2019s out. The FX-6 seems like the perfect update for the launch box.",

Assuming the FX6 will release November. Hah, I may actually just take a couple month break if it means the launchbox will be updated with the fx6 in that time",

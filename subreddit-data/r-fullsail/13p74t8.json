    "postText": "If you are enrolled in RA bachelor, Could you guide me, please? I have no doubts about my vocation but after reading about a lot of bad experiences, is FS education worth it? Is it true that no one will take you seriously? No jobs? No placements? Let's face it, no one will ever do the dirty work for you, but even if you give 200% of yourself, will you fail? I am not talking about waiting for someone to hire you just because you attended FS, I talking about being able to succeed in the industry thanks to your effort. Thanks",

Now, of course, we can learn a lot on Youtube but after 3 years of investing and sometimes wasting money on courses, I came up with the conclusion that is better to learn from someone or an institution that knows what they are teaching you. Of course, your point is valid, but I definitely would rather study in a college and make contacts.",

I really didn't use the ra degree besides making sounds for games in a couple game jams. I don't think it was worth it for me, but it was fun! I wouldn't recommend it",

I am a music producer that wants to get involved in the post-processing of audio, in other words, a mixing engineer. Thanks for your reply!",

    "postText": "I'm usually a lurker on Reddit - except for a comment here or there or a small post I just don't typically go out of my way to contribute anything of substance.\n\nBut last week - my town was destroyed by Hurricane Matthew. Without giving out my exact location, I live around St Augustine/Daytona. \n\nAnyway, I was without power and internet for a good 6 days. As all of you who attend Full Sail may know, the classes are fast paced and typically last a month (unless you're on campus). Missing 7 days is a HUGE deal and can cause irreparable damage making you have to repeat the course the following month. \n\nBut since I have all A's and am a good student, my advisor worked with my student liaison and professor and offered me several extensions. I was so grateful and struggled to catch up all week. \n\nThis past week I didn't start my project (due Monday) until Saturday (I'm in 3D Animation and this shit takes forever). Without me even asking, my professor called me and offered me yet another extension.\n\nI know this is a long post, but I had to share how helpful and incredible the staff and professors have been during this super frustrating and stressful time in my life. I've been to a couple different schools and I have to say Full Sail University is by far the best; \n\nThey listen. Care. And give GREAT education. People argue that you can learn some of the same things on Lynda and yeah I suppose that is half true (though we get 3 years of Lynda paid subscription free with tuition) but there are hours and hours of one on one labs and help sessions you can attend and sign up for that will help advance you faster than you could imagine.\n\nAgain, sorry this is long winded but I wanted to share my experience. Anyone who is questioning going into the CA, GD, or GA programs let me know and I can answer any questions you have! ",

What helps is that the professors all have to be currently or have been in the industry and be active in it; which helps with networking.\n\nWe just had Sony come by and try and get interns (paid mind you) and usually chooses full sail student Bc of their knowledge and ingrained work ethic \n\nSorry I traveled a little off topic. \nIf you want to do the masters for GD just be prepared to not work or have much of a social life for the 12 months (or is it 10? Honestly I forget). But if you are committed and go above and beyond you're fine.\nAt this level, you won't have many peers that aren't completely serious about their degree. My friends that are currently doing it and the two that finished do nothing but rave about it. A lot of the negative stuff you find online is honestly people (mostly Recording Arts students) who were lazy but wanted to be the next Scott Storch and were pissed when the school dropped them.\n\nYou get what you put into it - attend all the networking events. Do all the work. If the criteria is \"do 5-8\" do 10+. \n\nIf you want I can give you their contact info (I'll ask them first) so you can ask them more specifics than I would be able to answer ",

I think one of my biggest fears, as I already have my bachelor's, is ending up in the same \"no experience no job\" boat after finishing. Since full sail bee lines the degree, I was afraid I'd not have any time for internships or things that would make it easier to get into the field. \n\n\nIn the meantime, what are networking events exactly?",

Big game companies (blizzard was just here), Sony was here getting us to apply for their paid internships etc etc. and then like twice a semester are the major ones for grad students and students about the graduate where you go to these huge events where there are like 40+ major companies. Think of it like an exxclusive job fair JUST for FS students. \n\nThey also have a career development team that sets up interviews and works with you before and after graduation. You are allowed to use them for basically as long as you need. Say you get a job somewhere all is well and after 4 years you get fired -Bam contact FS CD team and they'll help you again. They were the ones who helped my friend Gene get that interview with RS North ",

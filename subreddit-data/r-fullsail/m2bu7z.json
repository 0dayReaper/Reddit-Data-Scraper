I failed a class, however I was confused because I was a few weeks into my next class and got no notification about the last class. What they did was they scheduled me to retake that class a month or two down the line, which I did and passed. I am pretty sure I got under a 70, but maybe the grade scale differs based on what program you are in. I hope this helps!",

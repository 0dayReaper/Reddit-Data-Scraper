    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI\u2019m a 25 year old on active duty in NE. Since I was 16, My dream was to own/work in a recording studio. I have some recording experience, I recorded a basement EP in high school, and currently mess around with Studio One. \n\nI\u2019m just finishing up my Bachelor\u2019s in Broadcasting Production. My question is, has anyone completed the Audio Arts Certificate online? What was your experience? I\u2019m not sure I am ready to commit to the associates or bachelors program, due to my full time job. Any insight would be great. Thanks!",

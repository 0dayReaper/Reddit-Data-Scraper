    "postText": "I'm from Italy, and next year I'll graduate from high school (hopefully)\nI've always wanted to attend university abroad, and after doing a fair bit of research FullSail was the school that appealed to me the most\nI am very lucky to be in a financial situation that allows me to move to the US and pay for the school, and fortunately my English is very good (C2 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages)\nNow that I've found this subreddit though, I would like to know a couple more things\n\n\u2022 How are foreign students treated? (I don't expect some kind of \"special\" treatment, just if there are differences in how they are introduced to the school)\n\n\u2022 How much prior knowledge of programming/tech in general is required? (In my country they prefer teaching dead languages than teaching basic programming or even how to use windows, so unfortunately most of my skills are self-taught)\n\nThanks in advance for any replies.",

            "comment": "Hi foreigner here attending campus for entertainment Business.\n\n The school has a fairly large foreign student population and during the week of orientation you will have a few meetings to go to with International Student Services where you will get a mentor. They provide all the information that you will need in terms of living here for the duration of your degree with events and what rules you need to follow. They have get togethers every month, Plus they are always an email or phone call away if you have any questions. \n\n The only thing I will say is make sure you have funding because you will not be able to work on campus or nearby due to limitations of the F1 visa. The only job you are eligible to have is as a behind the scenes tour guide which is very competitive to get because a lot of international students are going for it. I\u2019ve been here 6 months, I have 6 months left and I only just got a position. \n\n Definitely get in touch with the international department and they can give you all the information you\u2019ll need. I did my undergrad and now my masters here and I have had very little issues with the school and have enjoyed every minute of it. \n\nHope this helps! Feel free to DM me if you have any other questions.",

            "comment": "I'm not a foreign student, but currently attending on campus.  Winter Park is a pretty decent town, but Full Sail is on the outskirts.  Be careful when arranging an apartment as some of the closest ones (azure, indigo, lakeside villas) are pretty notorious for being run down and shady.  I considered moving closer but most of these places won't let you look at your unit until you sign a lease.  This isn't a normal practice in the US.\n\nI'm in the software development (now computer science) program and you don't need much prior knowledge of programming, but it doesn't hurt.  Unless things have changed you start off with C# for a month or two and move on to C++.  \n\nThe first few months will be more general education courses depending on which degree you decide to pursue.  Those classes are very easy to do well in, I would recommend making friends with some students a few months ahead of you in your degree and getting a head start on the material.",

To me the campus atmosphere seems like it would be welcoming towards foreigners, and probably more so than many places actually. The part of town the campus is located in isn\u2019t really very exciting, like most places in the US you\u2019d probably would want a car or to be close friends with someone who has one. But FS courses are intense and the facilities have some great tech so if you wanted to just focus 100% on learning there you could.\n\nAs for the computer programming, if you choose a tech program and you are not already proficient in computer science concepts you are going to have a hard time (this was the case for me). I\u2019m guessing this is a common theme across all of their programs, you really need to be somewhat knowledgable in what your major will be, if that\u2019s the case FS will help you boost that knowledge and introduce you to the industry side.",

Many of the classes I had did demos on a MacBook and you had to use it in class to do assignments. It\u2019s more difficult to teach students if they are on a different system that the teacher isn\u2019t familiar with or the curriculum isn\u2019t designed around.",

The music production program maybe different, if it relies on Logic Pro or something. However, I could see the recording industry actually using OS X as their standard, so in that case you would be better off with the launch box. Otherwise I can\u2019t think of a degree program that may use OS X specific applications. Overall though I doubt you\u2019d really be that screwed if you used your own PC.",

It\u2019s one class a month for 29 months basically(there\u2019s and exception in month 27)  and the first half of that you\u2019re stuck in recording arts classes. Now it\u2019s not a terrible thing and you learn a lot that you can apply to the live stuff and the show pro classes BUT it\u2019s taught towards the recording arts kids. If I can give you any advice between extended or not I\u2019d say do the not. 20 months is a lot faster and by month 28 you\u2019re burnt out of the classes and really just wanting to go work. Like me. lol. If you have any other questions feel free to ask and I can answer to the best of my ability. I also recommend doing the behind the scenes tour. 100% worth and you get a tiny taste of what we do. Also if you are local and wanna check out what the final project is like for the program let me know and Ill send you the details.",

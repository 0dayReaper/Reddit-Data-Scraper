    "postText": "Hi Full Sail folks:\n\nWe\u2019re StreamKick (based in Orlando btw), and we\u2019re working hard building a stream discovery platform to help viewers find streamers they\u2019ll enjoy, based on ones they already like, or on their personal preferences at any given time. Think of it as a robust search engine for streaming, blended with intelligent match-making.\n\nIf you\u2019re a viewer, we'd like to know how you find or would like to find streamers. If you\u2019re a streamer, we\u2019d like to know how you differentiate to attract and retain an audience. This survey is very short (10\u2019ish questions) - and we\u2019re choosing 5 respondents at random to receive a complimentary tier 1 sub on Twitch. Either as a gift to your channel, or to the channel of your choice. You can find it here:\n\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/6sI9jbNJnxdjFNeM2\n\nWe shared this on /r/Twitch as well so if you're part of that community you might have seen or participated already.  If so, thanks!  If not, we know the Full Sail community is deeply involved in esports, gaming, and streaming.  Because of that your input would be very insightful.\n\nWe're closing out the giveaway component this Sunday night, but the survey will remain open indefinitely.  Really appreciate your help.\n\nAnd thank you /u/Seraph_Grymm for allowing us to share this with your community.",

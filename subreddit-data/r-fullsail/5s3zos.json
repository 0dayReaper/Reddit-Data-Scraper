    "postText": "I'm looking at their tuition page trying to estimate what my total cost would be attending their online Internet Marketing program.  It says $31,000 total for 3 semesters.  I'm a bit confused considering their courses are monthly.  I doubt it's $31k for the whole course from looking up estimated costs and such.  With it being a 32 month course, 3 semesters doesn't really add up.  How would I calculate the total cost of my time being there?  Sorry if this is a stupid question, I'm just confused by how they represent it. \n\nhttps://www.fullsail.edu/admissions/tuition?sortby=online#breakdown\n\nEDIT:  I think I understand it now.  32 months being around 2 and a half years (5-6 semesters), meaning it would be around $62,000?  Any insight on this would be appreciated.",

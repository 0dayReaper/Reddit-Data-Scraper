            "comment": "On the topic of UCF vs Full Sail Game Design I have a friend who went through Full Sail and my cousin just got done with UCF's Game Design degree. Both degrees seem comparable with the usual notable exceptions:\n\n* Full Sail is much faster paced. If you take a longer time to digest material, it may not be a great choice. If you want a fast-paced, streamlined experience, Full Sail is great.\n* UCF, in general, is much less expensive. If this isn't a concern, then Full Sail is fine. \n* UCF will let you \"build your schedule\", to a degree. Full Sail will not. You are on a strict schedule with a linear timeline, with very few exceptions. If you're a campus student expect 40 hours a week. If you're an online student plan for at least 20.\n* IN MY EXPERIENCE Full Sail's instructors are typically more accessible. That's not to say that UCFs professors aren't accessible, or that there's no exceptions, but my cousin had some experiences with absent professors at UCF. Which, I get, some of those guys have 200 students.\n* Full Sail is what you make of it. It will be on you to make the time, connection, and put in the work you need to be successful. Anyone will tell you the real values of Full Sail are the speed, the technology, and the networking.\n\nCurriculum wise the core curriculum seemed mostly the same. Main difference is my cousin started in animation, changed to game design, and was able to get a minor in film studies in her spare time in addition to her main focus. That kind of thing isn't an option at Full Sail.",

Same degree program as OP.\n\nYou're not on a strict schedule. There's plenty of flexibility in your classes, you just have to ask. The schedule *is* predetermined, but easily changed if you have circumstances in which you need, or even just want it to be changed (my schedule has been changed twice). \n\nWhen I was an online student, we had, at most, 5 hours of coursework per week, excluding lectures which in all cases were two hours long, three times a week (per class). Since I've been taking classes on campus, lectures are two hours long (either three *or* two times a week) followed by \"three hours\" of lab time (I've never spent more than 10 minutes in lab, and in one course the instructor just decided we didn't need labs at all). Otherwise the out of class coursework is exactly the same, five maybe ten hours per class if you're really *really* trying to impress. You'll never have more than two classes and sometimes you only have one. If you choose the extended program, you always have only one class.  \n\n\n&gt;...get a minor in film studies in her spare time in addition to her main focus. That kind of thing isn't an option at Full Sail.\n\nYes it is, I have the option of taking a minor (and far more than enough time, only considering classes, to do so).",

Those classes are set in stone and the order in which you take them is primarily set in stone. You can check the current course catalog for the number and order of those exact classes.\n\nAs a campus student, you take 2 classes a month: MWF and TuThu. *You are expected to be on campus 40 hours a week and attendance is mandatory.* If you finish early, or your lecture gets out early, you may sometimes leave early, *but do not rely on that.* As a campus student, you also have the option of taking an extended schedule which is 1 class a month. All online degrees are 1 class per month.\n\n*Many of those classes* are known as \"immediate reschedule\" classes. That is, you *must* pass those classes in order to proceed further in the degree. They are prerequisites.\n\nYou *can not* change the order in which you take those classes. These are most of your degree-specific \"core\" classes.\n\nYou *do not under any circumstances* get to choose at what time during the day you can take that class. If you are a campus student, you are given a schedule and told where to be and when, you do not choose it as you would at a traditional college.\n\nYou *may be able to* swap a core class with a general education class that is somewhere further in your degree. You *may not* be able to swap classes at all if you have no more available general education classes to do so.\n\nAt any time you can *pause* your degree for up to 6 months. However, you can only do that a certain amount of time as you *must* complete your degree within a certain time span. Doing so may impact your financial aid *especially if you're on a GI bill.*\n\nYou *can not* just take any class you want at any time for any reason. Your tuition covers *those specific classes*. You can't take a class from another degree unless it's a shared class in both degrees.\n\nFull Sail *does not* offer simultaneous minors during your degree. You *may* take a separate Associates if you choose *after* or you may stop your degree early and choose to instead accept the Associates.\n\nYou *can not and should not opt to take 2 degrees at once.*",

            "comment": "I'm a student in The Simulation and Visualization degree at fullsail, and I've got a couple of buddies at UCF since we often collaborate for different projects (outside and inside of school).\n\nIf your getting all expenses covered for the duration of your schooling, your already lloking at a matter of \"what do I WANT* out of the school I study at. I kind of agree that the UCF social life is better for most people all around, but personally I like my social circles at Full Sail since everyone I talk to always has something interesting or new that they're working on for class, but there is an element of tension due to the fact that, like I said, there is always something that they are learning, ergo you are always putting your nose to the grindstone.\n\nThis is different to the UCF folk I hang out with as it's a normal college, where you got a bunch of classes and a ton of homework that just feels like busy work, and then you have the 1 or 2 project every year that are your degree projects. It's a different lifestyle but some people prefer the slow burn more than the intense and fast classes that full Sail does.\n\nIn terms of the class structure, at fullsail every month is either 1 or 2 classes, which for the first half of your degree is a manageable 20-30 hours of work per week depending on your degree, whereas when you get up to the send half of the degree things get difficult. I have often spent weekends just trying to finish homework to submit late, and that was if I even could finish it. Another thing to know is that each day on campus is equal to about 2-3 weeks of UCF class (normal college classes), which means that if you miss a day you might genuinely fail due to the loss of info.\n\nA positive ot this method is that even if you fuck up a month and you don't pass, you only have to retake 1 month as opposed to 4 or 5 at UCF, which means you know exactly what your getting into.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that a few months into your degree at Full Sail it pretty much becomes you, a few classmates, and your teacher. I have legitimately had a few months where I was the only student in my class, and while it's a bit odd in general, going to college for 1-1 studies is kickass. UCF, as far as I know, currently does not offer classes if they have less than ~5 students sign up for them.\n\nThe living situation are both full Sail and UCF is shit, as apartment prices are crazy high, but if the GI bill covers living expenses you should be pretty good in that regard. UCF general has a lot more \"dorm style\"  apartments for rent whereas Full Sail is more houses and normal apartments for rent, full Sail also has no dorms whatsoever, just a campus to learn and do events at.\n\nFood is good around both of them, though the UCF campus has more options it's also a UGE campus, as it has like 60k on campus student or something.\n\nOne more thing to note is that UCF you have to get your materials for class on your own (textbooks, laptop, etc) whereas Full Sail includes a launch box with literally everything your need for your degree in its tuition. \n\n\n\nThat's about what I got for info between the two, I think I got most of the things you would need to know covered.\n\nTldr from my biased perspective: Full Sail = hard mode, no bullshit classes constantly, lots of straight direct and relevant information for you to learn how to do what your degree does, and it is fast and easy to make mistakes, though it's easy to reach out for help.\nUCF = standard college mode, 4 year traditional school where you are one of many, sometimes you might get more help for a class or two but it's a game of chances.",

I'm not gonna say if you put the work in then it'll work bc, who doesn't put work into something they're paying for. \n   I'm a military brat and used the last 3 months at full sail bc unfortunately I wasted it at scamming SCAD, but they didn't leave me hanging. They helped me decide which finance plan was the best for me. Even today I called them to clarify my tuition costs. Turns out my 29k tuition is actually lower bc of the transfer credits I earned in community College. \n   Everyone says this school is a scam and expensive but, my loans are no where near the double digits, the instructors are actually willing to listen and learn from Their mistakes. Yes I said their. And they'll provide you with a launch box if you want it. I'm online btw. Now if I were to be at UCLA, SCAD, SFAI... yeah ill probably be at least 150k in debt. Really it just depends if you can handle a fast paced schedule or if you really need the time.",

You can take a failed one for free a 2nd time but if you fail a third.

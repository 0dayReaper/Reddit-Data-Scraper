But I can say that what I learned at fullsail was invaluable. Hopefully somebody can vouch for the online courses but if you can afford the school I'd say go for it. The school is largely what you make of it. You aren't guaranteed job placements when you graduate and you will have to grind to get where you want. But with a humble mindset and really soaking up the education you can do great for yourself. \n\nOn a side note if you decide to go through with the school and you make it all the way through, do not go in to the industry expecting to be an engineer or even assistant engineer in the studio. Expect to run errands for a while. I went for show production and touring and I stage handed for a couple years and only advanced because I met people. Fullsail does not have the best name in the audio industry but you can help give it a better name by staying true on your resume, being humble, and most importantly NEVER stop learning. It's a competitive industry but showing that you want learn and actually absorbing the knowledge will put you farther ahead than anything else you could ever do. \n\nSorry it was long winded but this industry is my passion and it's all because of this school and the people I have met at this school. That experience I wouldnt trade for the world.",

Thank you for being honest! What do you do now, if you don\u2019t mind my asking?",

Needless to say, I only lasted a year and developed/enhanced a drinking problem.  \n\nI didn\u2019t go to WVU to learn.  I went to party.  Twelve years later, after rekindling my inner fire for music that I\u2019ve had when I was younger and not immersed in the party life I decided to chase my passion of being a music producer.\n\nIt is NOT easy. It is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do in my life.  The schedule changes every single month and you don\u2019t get your next month schedule until a few days before the new class starts (have fun explaining this to employers, I work as a server at the Perkins on University Ave and got extremely lucky with the management staff here\u2014 it\u2019s an open secret that if you tell a prospective employer you attend full sail you won\u2019t get hired because of the rapid schedule changes)\n\nWith that said, I\u2019m in month eight now and almost all of the people who aren\u2019t serious have failed out or fallen behind, so I am completely surrounded by like minded individuals who I enjoy learning from and collaborating with (which is actually part of the curriculum\u2014learn/work with others on musical projects)\n\nAdditionally, the structure of what classes we\u2019ve taken and in what order have been absolutely perfect.  Beginning with general education courses like Psychology of Play &amp; Creative Presentation, and moving on to more major-specific classes like Musicianship &amp; Music Production Portfolio.\n\nI\u2019ve learned how to read the language of music (kinda).  It\u2019s extremely vast and complex, but it has patterns along the way.  \n\nI hope this is enough context.  I love this stuff.  If you want to check out my music and see the progression, by beats are available on beatstars and clips are on Instagram.  Simply search for ANOM ALEEZ.\n\nEdit:  I\u2019m now 6+ years sober and do whatever I can to help people in the situations I used to be in.",

It took 3 submissions to get my 4 semesters of Music Theory (I earn a degree in Music before applying) to be accepted as credit for their Principles of Music and Structure of Music. Music Principles is maybe the first couple of weeks of Semester 1 Theory.\n\nTake a look if you have other classes like Psychology, Music History, Art History. They will take credit for those also.",

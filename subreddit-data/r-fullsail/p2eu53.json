    "postText": "Hello! Is anyone currently in/have graduated the Media Strategy certificate program? I've been perusing many different online options within my budget and have come across this one. I have a BA in New Media with a focus on Graphic Design and have 5+ years of experience in the field. I am looking to develop my skills to get placed at better jobs in the near future. The degree description and courses sounded right up my alley.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I think the certificate programs are new (like under a two years old) so I\u2019m not sure how many people have completed the programs yet that would be in this read. However, you do get placed in classes that are part of degree programs if that helps! A few of my first year classes had quite a few certificate program classmates",

    "postText": "Full Sail University has been my dream school since I was in middle school. I always knew I wanted to work around art, technology, and people. I researched as much as I could on the website, but there wasn't much to go off of, so I started looking through social media and all of a sudden, all I see are horror stories and how it's not worth it... And how the graduation rate is SUPER low... I've also seen people make jokes about how toxic the community is too. I plan on moving to Orlando in around 2 years, because I'm currently living with my husband, and he has 2 more years left on his military contract before we can move. \n\nI know the top complaint was the cost, but I did the math and I would pay next to nothing thanks to the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Housing isn't an issue either, since I'll be living with my husband. But other than that, I'm just so afraid that it'll be horrible, stressful, or toxic like I've heard it would be. I'd love to hear some honest answers about how this school is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I've heard this school sucks, but I want to go so bad and have the means to pay the tuition. Is it REALLY that bad?\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone who commented, I'm more excited than ever to go! I know it'll be hard but hey, that's what makes it exciting.",

            "comment": "Hello,\n\nI went for the BFA in Creative Writing for Entertainment - Online - so can\u2019t speak for the campus experience - though I did live in Florida.\n\nI also used the Post -9/11 GI Bill with the Yellow Ribbon program so I would have literally paid pretty much nothing for the program if I didn\u2019t take out some loans for living expenses to adjust back to civilian life.  \n\nWas it worth it?  I had fun.  I wrote a lot of different things and got to see my ideas come to life.  I even had one of my stories recently bought and performed on a very famous podcast.\n\nAfter dealing with deployments and other random shit in the military for years that was my gift to myself.  Is it the most lucrative degree? No.  Is it something that makes my resume stand out? Sometimes.  But I don\u2019t even work in that field.  I have a good job sure, work from home.  I do alright.  But it\u2019s not the dream writing job I wanted.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m finishing my MFA in Creative Writing from Full Sail\u2026 and will then try to find work as a teacher so I\u2019ll at least be working in the field.\n\nBottom line is - I enjoyed it.  It\u2019s not for everyone.  Classes are fast paced and take a lot of dedication.  You can\u2019t slack and you can\u2019t procrastinate, you WILL fail.  But if you can buckle down, know that to become a master of the arts takes a lot of work \u2014 and you can accept those things\u2026 it\u2019s worth it.\n\nJust my two cents but I wish you the best no matter what your journey ends up being.",

I was in the restaurant industry for a very long time, and I'd been watching it go downhill for years now and knew a change was gonna have to happen. I've been doing computer animation as a hobby for a really long time so that was kind of a no-brainer. Since I'm not a spring chicken anymore I wanted a fast degree. As well, bc I'm older and yadda yadda scholarships brought the cost down to something more reasonable. So for me Fullsail fit. Material I already know, I'm not going to be 100k in debt, I still might learn something, and I get a BS in just a tad over 2 years versus going to a traditional school. \n\nSo like I said it depends. I recommend you look at the program you're considering and see what companies highering in that field have to say. In my case for computer animation, no one really cares where you went to school, just that you did. In my industry, they care more about your ability. I'm sure this could be true for others as well, but I'm not in them so I can't speak on them.  \n\n\nI've seen a lot of bad things being said too. Some are founded, some are not.  Living 5 minutes from campus most of my life I've known more than a few people who graduated from there and went nowhere. Mostly because they didn't put in the work it take to get the job.ad you through it. It is very much being thrown in the depend.   \n\n\nI've seen a lot of bad things being said too.

            "comment": "Do it.*\n\nEveryone's experiences at fullsail have been different and you'll hear a new story every time you ask someone new,but generally speaking the school is exactly what you make of it.\n\nI am a Sim Vis student at the moment about 3/5rds the way done with my degree on the extended 29 month program, and I through my experience the most \"toxic\" people I've had to deal with have been 2 students that were on my team during the midterm group project, however that doesn't mean that the rest of my experience is worse off because of it.\n\nDon't come into this school thinking itll be stress free, it's a tough school that deals with next to no BS in order to get you educated and let you earn a degree. There have been days where I've worked with some of my peers from the crack of dawn till midnight, but it was worth it in the end to actually understand the concepts of my classes so that I could apply it going forward.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons that graduation rate is so low is due to the fact that fullsail accepts nearly everyone, but once the harder classes start hitting many people, including those thinking that it'll be an easy degree, drop out or fail. For reference I started in a pool of about 23 other Sim Vis students and as of this month I am the only one, due to the fact that some of them took a month off, are now ahead of me, or dropped out.\nIf you become a student here and you get to about month 6 (that's after all the federal requirement classes), you courses and topics will almost exclusively focus on your degree and it will get intense.\n\n\nI am having an absolute blast with my teacher and the teachers going forward. I love the concepts and I am really hyped to get to mess around with the Sim Vis stuff more and more. I have a lot ahead of me and I am very excited for my career going forward. \n\n\n******HERE COMES THE BUT******\nIf you aren't really sure what you want to do as a career going forward, I wholeheartedly recommend you take those 2 years that you have and sign up for some classes at a community College. Mess around with them, try to get back in the rhythm of college, see weather or not you actually like your potential future degree path at fullsail. Doing this will let you mess around with some more of the basic info/work that you might expect going forward, and it'll help you determine weather or not you actually think you'll enjoy That career. Plus, community College is usually pretty cheap, so if you don't like what you did you haven't invested too much into a wrong step, think of it as testing the waters instead. \n\nBest of luck on your continued research, \nGodspeed",

            "comment": "Hi, I graduated about 18 months ago from the Show Production major. I'm not sure what you're experience will be with whichever degree program you'd be going into but mine was kind of frustrating tbh. I spent about half of my time there taking classes that were more suited for music production or recording arts such as a music theory class, a class teaching me how to write songs, classes teaching me how to use protools and logic, with teachers insisting that we shouldn't complain because all the stuff was vital to our career even though when we got to the actual show production classes we barely needed any of the stuff we'd learned in the previous 8 months or so. COVID shutting down campus during my last three months also really put a damper on things but I'd assume (and hope) that in two years that won't even be a problem.\n\nAlso the Career Development system they have that's supposed to help put you in touch with potential employers doesn't really do much for me. It really just feels like another Indeed or LinkedIn.\n\nAs for the graduation rate being super low, a large part of  that is attributed to the cost of the school and the intensity. You take a different class every single month (sometimes two classes in one month) and the whole program is done in 20 months. There is an option for an extended program but that just makes it to where you don't have two classes in one month. I think a lot of people get overwhelmed and drop out. It will be stressful, that is a guarantee.\n\nAgain though, I went for Show Production which sounds like it'll be very different that what you're intending on majoring in so that's all just based on my experience and it might be very different for you.",

They made it seem like you were able to have a part-time job and also go to school and when I was struggling and was asking professors for help they told me I shouldn\u2019t have been working in the first place I beg of you not to attend this university I beg of you not for you to put your money into this you have so many other options fullsail is predatory and their prey on low income down on their luck students.

I absolutely sympathize with the fact that they've basically put you in immense debt and the absolute horror of dealing with the stress of school and a job at the same time. Someone definitely should've been there to warn you, and the fact that they let you attend without telling you that a job wouldn't be manageable during your time at Full Sail is extremely predatory and sad. \n\nI wish  you the absolute best for the future, and my only advice for you at this point is to keep your head high, and finish school. I see the pain you're going through, but please don't let it be for nothing. You've made it this far, so at least you'll have a degree to show that you worked your ass off. I know it's not much in today's world, but at least you'll have a killer story to tell.",

Their website is just one big advertisement.  Notice that there is no contact information.

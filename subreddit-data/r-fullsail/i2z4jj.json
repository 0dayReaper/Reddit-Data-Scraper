            "comment": "They won't swap them but you can re buy any of the parts independently. It'll be somewhat cheaper than retail. Alternatively you do have the highest level of warranty on the HP, mine stoped working one day I called the number on the warranty booklet and they overnighted me a 2 generations newer model maxed out. And IIRC it's a lifetime unlimited warranty so yeah I'd stick with the HP.",

The MXM GPU in mine went out just after the third year ended - this was years ago, I think you have a ZBook, we got elite book 8760w models.\n\nThat on site warranty is super nice though. Very quick turnaround and they meet you on your terms and schedule. They came to me at work and fixed my laptop in the conference room at my office.\n\nCan't speak to msi, but HP is good kit, especially the pro grade stuff. Multiple part options and interoperability, excellent build quality and durability, and just robust abuse-ready gear in general. Can't speak directly to the ZBook but it should also be trivially easy to take apart, you should be able to find an OEM guide for disassembly.",

If the cycle of new cameras repeats... It should be released in November. I think I will get my launchbox around Feb or March. Only in my 3rd month",

Took a while for them to add the 16\u201d MacBook too. Probably because they have to get rid of the current stock before they start giving new stuff",

    "postText": "Hey guys! So, I've been looking at going to Full Sail for a while now and wanted to know more about it. I'm planning on maybe going for Digital Arts and Design. So my questions are..\n\n- How are the courses? Are they extremely difficult? Will they be fun and engaging?\n \n- is Full Sail really as good as it seems? Do you get sought out in the industry after your time there?\n\n- What's the day to day life for a student look like?\n\n- Do I have to have a high SAT score to get in? For scholarships is it only to HS seniors? If I'm graduating a year early can I apply?\n\nThanks in advance guys!",

            "comment": "Hello! Not sure if it helps since I\u2019m not in that degree plan but I\u2019m currently enrolled and figured I could add a little bit to your knowledge. \n\n1. The courses are not that bad. Manage your time and stay on top of your workload. Please understand that these courses are fast paced so if you start to fall behind it will take more effort to get back on top. I try to remind myself everyday why I need to do my best and try and get ahead.\n\n2. Some people get mad when they get out of Full Sail with a degree and can\u2019t land a job. Understand no college can guarantee anyone a job. It is up to YOU. If you do what is required you will not stand out from your peers. But if you do your work and put in more effort and do side projects, you can have a larger better portfolio. So keep that passion at heart and really push yourself to standout, this will help you get a job.\n\n3. This depends on you and your degree. I am CS degree so I go to class MWF and have labs after lecture. I am required to be in class since I\u2019m on campus so online can differ. I use lab time to study on what we went over in class and do my lab work. I also try to do Udemy course in my free time to better understand the coding languages I am learning and do projects outside of class. Luckily for me I don\u2019t have to work so I try to stay focused on my courses.\n\n4. As far as SAT I don\u2019t think so. To get the best answer for your questions call and ask directly. Classes begin every month and not by semester so you could start within weeks of applying. Everything is dependent on you.\n\nHope this info helps and if you have any questions please ask!",

            "comment": "I can't speak to your specific program, but I'll try to give general answers based on my experience:\n\n - They aren't too difficult if you can properly manage your time. Most of the harder courses just took more research and communication with the instructor. \n\n - You get what you put into it. Take advantage of networking, instructor experience, and knowledge, career events, etc. If you just want to get through it for a piece of paper that says you went to Uni, you won't do well when job hunting.   \n\n - No, to the SAT thing. I'd call admissions and talk to them about your particular situation. \n\nSome notes:     \n\n - Please be mindful that this is an expensive, for-profit school. Before anyone gives the *boo-hiss* for that, keep in mind this is still a GREAT school but you want to get every penny's worth. There are a ton of alumni that work in the industry and the school is known for setting you up for success as long as you take advantage of everything it has to offer.  \n   \n\n - This school is fast-paced, much like many industries it teaches about. If you can't keep up with the fast pace of the classes, then it's likely you'll struggle in the industry.",

Then, search for jobs in your industry. Almost every job that pops up will probably have at least 1 alumni if not more already working there unless it's a fresh startup.",

More than half of my class can barely form a legitimate sentence, let alone write anything worth reading. The people they let stay in the Creative Writing program (despite their glaring illiteracy) is the only downside of Full Sail, in my opinion. If you rely on peer motivation, you might want to try somewhere that doesn\u2019t just accept anyone who is approved for financial aid.\n\nThat said, no, you don\u2019t need high SAT scores. You don\u2019t even have to be able to spell your own name correctly.",

            "comment": "I am gonna answer your questions from the game dev/ sim viz degree perspective, since that's the one I have.\n\n1.your first 8-10 months will feel pretty easy, submit the homework and your gonna do pretty fine, but all at once your classes are gonna get Hella serious, you'll see many of your peers fail a class or two and and your class size will seriously diminish, this is especially relevant at during and after midterm. If You keep it up and make sure you stay healthy and not burnt out, you'll be fine. Talk to your teachers, they are human and want to help, talk to your peers, they might be stuck on a similar issue or they could give you advice, or vise versa.\n\n2. You'll get out as much as you put in. I have seen students that are graduating from the game dev degree that haven't started job hunting yet, but I've also seen similar students apply for and get jobs 3 months before graduation. Unless your that 1 in a million superstar In your industry, your gonna have to make it your job to find a job. That being said, Full Sail really tries to help you, it has connection far and wide in almost any industry, so your not alone.\n\n3. Daily life for me is wake up, go to school, do as much as I can while I'm there, and then come back to my apartment near campus. It's often time mentally exhausting to be doing school work on campus all the time, but that's what your in for at a school that give you a 4 year bachelor in 2 years. Otherwise, there is a good campus life. People are usually in the hallways or many lounge areas chilling, doing work, laughing with each other, which is a hell of a lot more lively that what I saw at Purdue University. Also, there are a fair amount of pretty fun events on campus, from social meetups, game contests, and block parties.\n\n4. You will get accepted to full Sail, don't worry about that. If you have a high enough Sat score or if you have some college credits, you can maybe get out of some math classes or something, but almost everyone gets accepted to full Sail. Scholarships are dependent on degree programs, so read deep into what your getting into. \n\nFinishing thoughts, it's a damn good school if you know you want to do specifically what your degree is, otherwise take your time and make a good decision. I spent a year in community College trying out different courses after I graduated high school just trying to figure out what I wanted to major in, and full Sail was a good gamble for me. Take your time, no need to rush and make expensive mistakes.",

            "comment": "The difficulty really depends on the course you take and your work flow. I\u2019m taking recording arts right now and my classes so far have been pretty simple with the help of note taking and some studying. As for your second point, yes. Full Sail is good. From what i\u2019ve seen form my own eyes out here in orlando, many people turn and listen when you say that you\u2019re a full sail student. You can get sought out in the industry and they regularly bring in graduates and professionals that you can talk to and network with.\n\nFor your third point, most students that i\u2019ve come across are in the extended program so they only take one class a month and have a pretty relaxed time outside of class. There\u2019s more of a work load with the 23 month program that gives you two classes per month and that can get hectic if you aren\u2019t on top of everything. I\u2019m currently in the extended program and can say that I\u2019m having a good time, I have time to myself, I can work and I can also take on side projects because I don\u2019t have that much of a work load. As for SAT\u2019s, I\u2019d speak to admissions because it may or may not have changed. I didn\u2019t have to submit one (i enrolled when schools weren\u2019t requiring them)",

I only know answers for the first question but I hope even the little amount of insight will help :)\n\nThe courses so far are fun and engaging. Just be prepared for discussion posts where you have to reply to other students. Main thing is picking apart others\u2019 work and giving them pointers and what they can improve on. There\u2018s a lot of reading but there\u2019s 0% weight to the grade and they usually aren\u2019t due until Sunday at 11:59 PM EST, and you can always go back to it when you complete the section. Get familiar with PowerPoint, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Outlook, OneDrive, and any other Microsoft apps that may be used. Hope this helps some!",

I go to another university and have looked at Full Sail in the past, but I haven't really taken the thought of transferring seriously. \n\nI noticed, though, that they call me every now and then, and I was just wondering if it was just an automated thing or something that they do for anyone interested. They don't leave messages, so I don't really know what it's about.\n\nShould I pick up next time they call me then? I really can't do much for the school unless I had like an offer from them",

Graduating in July.\n\nDon't have great advice on finding on-screen talent, but if you know of any acting or improv schools/classes, you can try reaching out to them.\n\nYou may have luck putting casting calls out on Instagram or whatever your social media of choice is that connects you to folks you trust locally.\n\nAlso check the rules for advertising casting (and crew) calls with your local film commission! I got hired to film a short student film by responding to a listing on the local film commission website.\n\nAnd if you want to reach out and talk shop or want some moral support from a fellow DCBS student, please don't hesitate to send me a DM. I have discord, too. I don't know of any active DCBS servers but I'm trying to convince the program director to get one made for us!",

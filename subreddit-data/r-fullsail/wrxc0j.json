            "comment": "Have you exhausted your Federal Financial Aid option(s) that are available to you by completing your FAFSA? Most private lenders outside of Sallie Mae will deny you simply because it's not a traditional 4-year college, so it's difficult without a co-signer. \n\nI was in your shoes once like 10 years ago trying to figure out how I could afford Full Sail &amp; receive financial aid without a co-signer, plus I was too young to be considered as an independent applicant at the time for FAFSA. I ended up enlisting for the college benefits and now I'm finally here on campus 10 years later, a few months from graduation. All paid for. DEFINITELY not suggesting that as an option, but rather to express that I understand how seemingly impossible it is to get financial aid for Full Sail. It's tough, but I've seen some students manage to make it work. Don't make crazy life-changing decisions like I did for the sake of an education. lol",

I had this issue when I was younger, even though I moved out at 17 and had my own job, place and paid all my own bills they still used my parents income until I was 26. \n\nI would take a look into jobs that offer college help. I think Taco Bell and Best Buy have programs to assist with college as well as others. Might be worth while to look into",

Typically, regionally accredited schools do not accept credits from nationally accredited schools 1:1. They will often reject them outright. However, they often have an appeals process where you can make your case for them to accept the credits. YMMV, but don't expect much.\n\nI don't know exactly what it is for the extended IT Bachelors, but you have effectively achieved an Associates after 2 \"semesters.\" This is typically at your halfway point or after your 2nd Project and Portfolio class IIRC.",

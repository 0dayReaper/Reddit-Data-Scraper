    "postText": "I wanted to start the game art program on Aug 2nd, but I don't want to buy the launch box. I already own Zbrush, photoshop, and all the necessary software. (I work in this field, I just wanted a degree.) I have an ipad, and a powerful gaming laptop. I have the 32in cintiq and I recently bought a new pc with a 3090.\n\nI'm specced out, is what I'm saying. And I've been told that to attend the university, I have to buy all the software licenses and some laptop that I don't need or want?\n\nMy enthusiasm is greatly dimmed, and I will probably not attend just based on this. I can afford the launch box, I just don't like being fleeced for 4 grand.  I thought I would be able to decline this since I have everything.\n\nI don't know. It's not much money compared to the rest of the degree. But I don't like being told that I have to buy crap that I already own. Can it be declined or should I go somewhere else?",

You will be told you are responsible for making your own accommodations for any particular lecture as a result. Doesn't seem like that'd be an issue for you, though.\n\n*If* you are found to be using pirated software it can be very serious. So don't risk that. (I don't know how or why they would know/or check, but it is something that has been discussed iirc.)",

You just have to sign something that says you agree that Full Sail is not responsible to provide you technical support since you are using your own equipment.  Not sure if they are still offering it or not, but when I first enrolled there was actually a scholarship that covered all but maybe $300 of the cost of the launch box, if they are still offering something similar, I'd say take the launch box and just sell it.  You get a factory sealed MacBook (late-2019 is what's going out right now), so very easy to flip",

Because it was optional I fought like hell to get a non Mac but no dice.... I put  windows on it with boot-camp and threw it in the corner. I never use it. Purely a back up. It's a kids toy compared to my rig, and something I would never buy or use for \"Pro\" work in any way. It's underpowered and over priced crap. \n\nI'm on my 12th month of the Computer Animation Bachelor program. I looked to see how the programs differ and they don't seem to diverge until month 17. Up to this point I haven't seen or used anything I didn't already have. With the exception of the scanner.  \n\n\nGood luck, any more questions ask away.",

However, the rep said she would raise the issue with the dean and see if they could make an exception.\n\nLike you, I can't imagine any use I would have for their laptop. I just upgraded a bunch of my stuff around the beginning of the year. I have the paid version of unity, and pretty much anything I can imagine. It took me years to afford it all.",

I think the admissions counselors do get in trouble for not \"selling\" these, so they are likely just BS'ing you to try to make sure Full Sail gets credit for that.  They are still sitting on a boatload of 2019 MacBook Pro's so they are probably trying to get rid of those as quickly as possible before Apple makes the Intel Mac's obsolete.",

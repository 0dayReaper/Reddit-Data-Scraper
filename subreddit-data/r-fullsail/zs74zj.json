    "postText": "Hello Reddit...\n\nI recently had an interesting situation and I would like to hear what you guys (and gals and everything in between) think about it.\n\nI graduated High school in 2004 back in Puerto Rico. After finishing high school, I wanted to pursue my dream of becoming a game developer so I flew to Florida to check Full Sail out. At the end of the day my parents decided that being a game developer was not a \"real career\" and talked me out of it (yes, my biggest mistake). I then became a Paramedic as my father did and eventually went into Med School. I decided to go to Med School in the Dominican Republic since it was cheaper and it's way more hands-on (as a medic used to deal with patients and real situations, hands-on was appreciated). While in Med School, I knew that it was not what I wanted to do, but at that time it was too late. I was already more than halfway through and already in a lot of student loan debt. I finally graduated med school from a different school than the one I started (long story short, they got caught stealing money from the student loans) and went on with my life. I've never taken the tests because TBH I don't want to do it. As a 36 y/o guy I decided to finally go back and enroll in Full Sail, what I wanted to do as an 18 y/o fresh out of high school. I decided to enroll in web development since I've acquired multiple skills throughout the years that would suit that profession and it's mostly \"coding\" which is what I've always loved. \n\nUpon enrollment, I was asked for my high school transcript and I'm told that my high school does not meet US criteria, well, up to what I understand, Puerto Rico is held up to the same standards as the US, and they can't take my Doctorate unless I get it \"certified\" which is over 200 dollars, plus I've got to clear my account with my Med School (about 25000 USD) so they can send an official transcript. BTW, my Med School is accredited in the US and I'm able to take the national Boards and practice in all US territories.\n\nI've been told that my options are, either to get a GED or have my Doctorate certified by a third-party company.\n\nThe takeaway from my story:\n\nDo what YOU WANT, don't try to make anyone happy or go for the \"traditional\" path. Choose what you love and enjoy doing, if you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life.\n\nHas anyone gone through a similar situation?",

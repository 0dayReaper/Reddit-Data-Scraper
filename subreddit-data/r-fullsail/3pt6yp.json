    "postText": "Hey!\n\nI'm pretty much set to go to Full Sail and start the Recording Arts program on February 29. I'm extremely pumped to start as I look forward to dedicate my life to audio and music. I already have a lot of experience with music production and I'm more interested to learn more about the business and networking, plus having the experience of living by myself on a different country.\n\nAnyways, I was born and raised in Chile, and I've never lived anywhere else. I have been to the US though, and I love it. I feel like it just fits my lifestyle and interests in a better way, and the music business is certainly more developed than in my homeland. For this last reason more than anything, my plan is to stay in the states for as long as I'm allowed to. I'm aware that it's possible to extend my VISA for a year after I graduate to find some kind of job, and if I manage to land a really good job my employer can consider extending it even further.\n\nSo, my questions are:\n\n- Is it possible to apply for citizenship/green card if I've lived and worked for long enough in the country (let's say 4-5 years)\n- With the current state of the music industry, how likely am I to land a job related to music after I graduate? (I know it's all about dedication and believe me when I say that I will give nothing less than my all)\n- What kind of job in the music industry could give me the possibility to stay for longer than a year? And in other industries (Cinema, Video Games)?\n\nedit: typo",

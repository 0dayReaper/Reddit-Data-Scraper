    "postText": "I need advice or help? \n\nI'm asking for my boyfriend since he's a little stressed out at the moment and we need some answers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's enrolled at Full Sail Uni. and he's currently taking the creative writing route and he's having to take a class that involves TV screen writing.. He took it back in February and he unfortunately failed... his professor called him later to explain he could retake it in April, which was this past month and he misunderstood the final assignment, which earned him an 58 in the class.... Is there a way he could discuss it with a guidance counselor or something along those lines? He's really concerned about having to retake this class and failing it again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe didn't have to pay anything to retake it, so would that be an issue now since he's already had to retake this class once before? Is it even required for the class? We're currently trying to start our lives together and I really hate to see him so upset... He worked on assignments for hours for this class and he just found out less than an hour ago he's not passing the class... So any advice will help.",

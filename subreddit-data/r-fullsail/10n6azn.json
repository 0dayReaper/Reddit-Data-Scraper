    "postText": "Hiya folks, as title states, I graduated from an accredited university with a Mathematics BS in 2021, and have not been able to find work in my field. I want to go back to school but I also don't want to waste most of my 20's in school getting a doctorate in math as well as my 30s paying it all back, so when I remembered FullSail, I had a pretty good idea that that's what I wanted to do. \n\nMy main issue is pricing. \n\nWhile I would love to do an in-person degree, I'm very worried that I won't be able to have much of, if any, income during that time. I have little savings, barely enough to keep myself a place to live working at a job that pays $12/hr. I would love to be able to work through college, but I don't know how much time/effort I would need to put into the degree itself, meaning my available option is loans. On top of that, my FAFSA still works off my parents income, making my available government loans much smaller than if it were based on my own. This was based on last year's information, so this may have changed, but I know for a fact that I'm ineligible for another Pell Grant, and I'm fairly certain I don't qualify for any other scholarships from Fullsail directly. \n\nAs I read through some other posts before deciding to write my own, I saw a couple of people talking about how online students seem to have a different experience than on campus students when it comes to job placement and networking. As it would be far more cost effective for me to do an online course while still working a job for most of the week, not to mention the potentially halved if not more housing costs, I would really appreciate any insight, not only on a Game Development course's perspective, but from any online student's perspective. \n\nFinally, I would really just appreciate some feel good stories. I've talked myself into and out of this more than I'd like to admit. For fear of dropping far too much money into something that may or may not have the appropriate returns. Hearing about others experiences from any discipline is something that I feel would encourage me to just break through my mental barriers and just do it, which feels almost necessary for me to find my place in the modern world. \n\nTL;DR Considering a Game Design Bachelor's but would love some external input as to which program to go with between online or in person. Also please share your story to encourage me to go for it myself!",

Ideally I'll come back once I've paid off the debt for this to get a design masters, but that's something I can worry about once I've gotten to a better financial position.",

Less likely to land a job solely based on the fact you\u2019ve got the degree. The game industry is tough to get into and you\u2019ll want to have a nice portfolio that goes above and beyond what Full Sail has you put together.\n\nI got hired at a AAA studio while still taking classes, fwiw.",

If you don't mind me asking, I've got two questions: Did you do an on campus course or an online course? And in terms of a portfolio, outside of the projects that Full Sail requires, about how many other projects would you say you worked on? Of course, no pressure to answer if that's outside your comfort zone, I'm just really curious to hear about other's experiences.",

    "postText": "Hey guys! I am currently attending full sail online and I am in month 3. I am currently in the game development program but I am debating switching to Computer Science. I would love to make games for a living, but I am just concerned about the degree being so specific. Would it be better to change to Computer Science or am I just overthinking things?",

            "comment": "Hey there \n\nIMO, CS is the way to go. While GD will give you invaluable insights into making the games you love... you should always plan bigger but more importantly ask yourself these questions..\n\n1. Is game development your passion?\n2. Will working in this field take away the joy you get from playing games? (Sometimes passion can burn you out)\n3. Are you willing to relocate for work?\n4. Are you willing to accept the fact you may spend more time than you\u2019d like searching for jobs?\n5. Do you want something that could help you should any of your goals change? Perhaps opening doors in other fields?\n\nThose are subjective, please don\u2019t take any of those the wrong way. There are Game Devs that make an incredible money and love what they do. On top of that.. they make some truly amazing pieces of work. \n\nGo with what you feel is right. This is your life, your story. You can\u2019t rewrite chapters but you can always write another.",

Also the \"you should always plan bigger\" really stands out. \n\nI'd say Game Dev is my passion, but I love having other doors open and possibilities there. What I want to do in Game Dev is engine development anyways, so I feel that leans closer towards CS.",

Mine was CS or Web Dev. \n\nSee, I\u2019m a software analyst in my profession. I\u2019ve accumulated nearly six years in my current position alone and been in the field even longer. There are parts of my company that I would love to further explore and I believe being a full stack developer is where I\u2019ll end my journey. \n\nSo it\u2019s all about finding the shoe that fits your foot now, but understanding your feet will grow!",

I\u2019m going for film and I have no qualms with constantly applying for new projects/job for the rest of forever (I get bored at normal jobs after a year anyways, I like change). Go with the degree program that benefits your passion the most. I\u2019m not sure what degree will benefit your idea of a career long term though.",

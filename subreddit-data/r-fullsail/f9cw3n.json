    "postText": "So I'm looking for some advice on the Creative Writing Degree and what all I should expect. Currently, I'm a junior in high school and just trying to see about the school before I commit. \n\nLooking at the school, for an undergraduate, they offer both campus and online courses. I know Online is cheaper but longer, would it be worth it to attend an online course? If I did attend online would I be eligible for a Launchbox? I'm also curious about what comes in a Launchbox for this course.\n\nI also wanted to ask about any alumni from the degree and see what they've done. I tried to look through the alumni section but wasn't able to find many. \n\nHow does the school help when it comes to helping publish students' work whether it be a movie script, video game, or book?\n\nThose are the main questions I have, thanks in advance to anyone who can help!",

Research.\n\nCall up the school, look through hall of fame, email people that are grads and currently in the industry.\n\nALSO all degree questions such as the launchbox and stuff, call a rep for the school you'll get put with someone you can ask all your questions to. Only problem is they sugarcoat everything (of course) but besides that DO THAT RESEARCH. You will not regret it after looking into it!!\n\nGood luck!",

I am 30 years old with an Associates of Applied Science in Medical Information Tech: Medical Coding but will be going to Full Sail in the coming weeks for a BFA in Creative Writing! I will be attending online since I live in Kentucky but my fiance has been going for a while now for Computer Animation and LOVES it. He's not had anything but positive situations and easy solutions to issues that arise.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m not sure where you want to be after you graduate, but I\u2019ll tell you my husband and my own experience. You can skip to the bottom for the short answer if you don\u2019t want to read the long one.\n\nWhen we decided to go to school we both chose full sail. My husband went for audio production online and I went for music production online. We both graduated in November. \n\nMusic production: the course was laid out pretty nice. The first 8 or so months I had all the same classes as the audio production degree. They focused on learning the equipment in the launch box, music theory, and a couple general classes. After the general classes the degrees parted ways and music production focused more on writing music for media and radio type music. I learned a lot about music and a lot about myself and my goals.\n\nTowards the end of the program there were music history, business, and music for film/ video game classes. These were very fun to go through but got very time consuming. \n\nThe only things I wish would have been different in my degree program was more focus on mixing music, and more classes focusing on film and media. I found out after my project and portfolio 3 (I think) class that I wanted to go down that road more than I wanted to write radio music. So I need a lot of film composing practice before I can move into the career, which is very lucrative but also very hard to get into.\n\nIf you go this route, be prepared to upgrade some of the launch box items. They will get the job done, but things like a bigger keyboard and an external hard drive will be important to get by \u201cyear\u201d 2-3.\n\nAudio Production: this degree is for someone who plans to record music, mix and master, but not write the music. It also has a heavy focus on sound design for video games and tv. \nThe launch box has A LOT more in it, the only upgrade needed would be new mix stands because the ones you get from the school are rather flimsy and an external hard drive.\n\nThere are significantly less classes that focus on music theory and structure. They have a heavy focus on editing audio to cut out unwanted sounds. The music theory is replaced with frequency training and mixing. You would be mixing a good amount of songs and also writing a few simple ones. You will learn a lot about getting a clean recording and heavily encouraged to make your own sound design library. \n\nAudio production also has you work on a few video game sections made by the teachers or specifically made for student short games. You will get alot more experience with middleware. \n\nMy husband didn\u2019t know what he wanted to do after school so his cons sort of reflect that. The teachers don\u2019t give as much feedback (or Atleast the ones he had). Now that\u2019s not ALL of the teachers, some worked with him and took more time to go over the projects. He also didn\u2019t have a lot of feedback from his peers through discussion posts. He now wishes there were more classes that worked on different avenues of sound design and even more music theory or structure. The degree isn\u2019t made for people who want to make their own music. The door is still open for a lot of different careers for him. He also wished they focused on less DAWS. He used a few different ones and the only one he is proficient at is protools, which is an industry standard so it isn\u2019t a big deal. He just didn\u2019t like mixing in three or four other ones without getting enough practice to be able to use them on a daily basis.\n\n\nWith all of that being said, both degrees are good for their purpose. We had a different experience online than the students who could go on campus. I can\u2019t speak for career placement as we live in an area where we can\u2019t work in the industry and when Covid hit it really screwed up our chances of moving to a bigger area. I know there are a few students who had the opportunity to start working immediately either through an employer or on their own projects. Networking online is hard. If you have the option to go on campus I would suggest it. For now we are both practicing and keeping our eyes out for a chance to make a move. \n\nThe classes aren\u2019t all that hard if you put the time into them. You get what you put in here and it will reflect on your grades. You also will get more opportunities and learn more if you do more than the bare minimum. \n\nLONG STORY SHORT: Music production is for people who want to write and compose music, Audio production is for people who want to record and mix OTHER peoples music or go into sound design. Both require hard work and LOTS of practice. I hope this helps!",

Idk if this makes me want to go or not yet but it\u2019s still something to definitely consider. I\u2019ve been off and on writing, producing, and DJing for about ten years, so I have some personal experience but I want some formal education and to learn from professionals, especially when it comes to mixing and mastering. I\u2019m fortunate enough to not worry about the cost at this point in my life so I\u2019m just trying to get an education that will hopefully supplement what I already know and take my production even further \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd\u2728",

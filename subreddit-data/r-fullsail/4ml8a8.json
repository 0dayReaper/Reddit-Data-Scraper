    "postText": "I just turned 22, and I've wanted to make movies since I was 13 or 14. I've never had a whole lot of money to my name, so I never said \"fuck it\" and bought a camera. Due to the very low amount of open jobs where I live, I recently thought of going to school and getting the standard degree to impress the interviewers, but I found myself drifting back to schools I dreamt of attending - The Art Institute, Full Sail, even the NY Film Academy. For a guy living in a desolate place in WA state, these schools always seemed like an impossible goal, even with grants and financial aid. But I'm starting to feel that if I don't take a leap and try, I'll never even come close to sitting behind a camera.\n\nCan anyone give me some advice on what I should do? Is Full Sail worth the effort? What about the Art Institute of Seattle? Should I just wing it and hope for the best, or focus myself a bit more? I honestly don't know what I should do at this juncture, if these schools are just a fantasy or something I can really achieve.",

The biggest differences between Full Sail and the other schools, is that Full Sail is the most up-to-date and interactive with all equipment and classes, which is quite the blessing since a lot of movies today are switching to Digital from Film incredibly fast. \n\nCompared to when I started in 2013 and now, the classes have updated since then. Definitely get in contact with some current Full Sailors if possible, and see what's changed. My only gripe is the scheduling. Just be ready for those last minute schedules to come in 2 days before the end of the month.\n \nAll the advice I gotta say is, if you truly put all your heart and soul into the school and network with others around you, as well as with one of the awesome career advisors, you'll do great. Just be yourself man. Everyone is there for one big reason; to enter one of the best and creative industries in the business. Good luck man!",

That could, at the very least, help with living expenses and help out padding the aid.\n\nFull sail is what you put into it. I know that EVERYONE says that, but it's true.\n\nThey tell you the average amount of work is 30-40 hours a week - do 60. Stand out. Take every opportunity they give you and you WILL be successful. \n\nLet me know if you need any advice. I can even put you into contact with my friend who is in film if you want! ",

Full Sail, however, has been a dream of an experience thus far, although I am going for a different program. But for a school that provides you with equipment, they have a very rigorous work schedule. I would recommend it, though. It's been a great experience so far.",

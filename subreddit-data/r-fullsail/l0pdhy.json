    "postText": "Hey everyone. I am currently enrolled to do Music production. I have been writing music sense I was in elementary school, have hands on experience with studios ( built my own with my band back in high school all funded by my school) . So this is the direction I am wanting to go   \n\n\nThat being said. I know that they dont really help everyone out with jobs afterwards. Granted they will see which students have the passion and fire to do what it is they are doing obviously   \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nShould i go for music production or is there a course here better suited for the word world   \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \nAlso considering game design, Business masters, or film production. Thank you everyone",

Has some the highest job rates post graduation in all of FS. Most graduates of game design/art have a very hard time finding industry jobs except for QA post graduation.",

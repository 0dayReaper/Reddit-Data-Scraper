I'm like I just had to start a job that is working, but like either way, I'm out on the streets in a few days. Like I'm really not sure what to do at the moment. I have no family that can help and I just don't know what to do anymore.",

And it helped. Don\u2019t give up on your dreams but if you need time off for your mental and physical and emotional health, take it.  The school and classes will still be there.",

I would reach out to see what they can do to help.\n\nGood luck, and I'm sending good energy and positivity your way!",

Also the good energy and positivity helps soo much! I'm going to try and get in touch with any resources to help, honestly I may have to push a little, but it's in the best interest of everyone. They are investing so much on my scholarship and I don't want to let anyone down",

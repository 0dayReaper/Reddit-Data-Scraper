    "postText": "There withdraw process is sort of general, but I don\u2019t fully understand the refund policy. This is what I\u2019m getting from it. I\u2019ll be finishing up my 16th week at the end of this month, so of course I will not get a refund, but I also want to make sure no more financial aid comes out. Sort of want to make sure I get accepted to my other school prior to withdrawing just in case. Do I just call up and say I\u2019m looking to formally withdraw?",

    "postText": "I was previously enrolled going for my Bachelors in Web Design &amp; Development. However, due to job loss and having a child, I was unable to keep up with my work. That eventually wound me up being placed on Academic Leave. I couldn't start my reentry process due to a outstanding balance that I had in the Business department. I recently setup a payment plan for that. I've heard from someone in the Admission's Department that usually if you setup a payment plan, you can start the reentry process. \n\nAnyone have any experience with this? I've been debating on if Web Development is the career path for me, and I can't stop thinking that it is. Thus, I need to get my a*s back into college and finish that degree. \n\nOh, and I had Financial Aid to help coverage the costs, and that was also brought up that usually if I do get accepted back, the balance with the Business Department would be covered as well.",

Maybe even your Admissions Rep if you're campus, or Admissions department if your and online student.   The BO could probably even tell you as well.  I'm a grad and i work here as well.  I hope this helps! Just let me know if you have any other questions!",

    "postText": "I got a call from full sail asking about more about music production.\nNow I've been recently trying to teach myself a bit (by making generic EDM) in FL studio \nBasically I want to make music.\nI've played a few instruments Drums/Guitar Etc. Didn't really find much music outside of metal interesting at the time.\nMy passion for music was getting close to dead then I found a music producer who just ignited my passion for it again. Now I find myself enjoying every genre noticing details in production that i just never cared to know.\nI want to make my own music\nI really enjoy Electronic and Hip Hop production\nbut when i mentioned making beats for hip hop whoever on the phone mentions Audio production may be more suited for that\nwe talked and still decided music production was best for me.\n\nTL;DR\nI want to make my own music I enjoy Electronic music a lot\nI just want to make sure I'm getting in the right program\nCan anyone explain more in detail differences between the two programs?",

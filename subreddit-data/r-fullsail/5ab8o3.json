So wouldn't this technically be a problem for students who will have to run Pro tools or other CPU intensive tasks?",

They'll most likely get rid of stock first, but even then, with the price increase for the macs, I doubt they'll distribute the new macs. Also, the new one has less ports and unison in USB C. Dongle for days. Touchbar is a gimmick ",

And since every student gets the exact same MacBook Pro I doubt they'll give just some people the new ones just for that.\n\nI'd say they'll start with the new ones in a year or two.",

Almost everyone in my group got one exactly like that. As I understand it, there were a few that had the 2016 models with the non USB-C connections, but I'm not sure if that's because they had degree tracks that required certain functionality.",

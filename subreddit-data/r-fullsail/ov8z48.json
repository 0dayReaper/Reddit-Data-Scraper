    "postText": "So, a little about me: I'm 23 years old; I studied linguistics at Ohio State, and I've spent most of my time after college teaching so far. I had some creative outlets I did on the side (music and writing, mostly), and have gotten to do some cool things with so far (recently, I held some writing workshops for the school I last taught at, and I've held workshops for juvenile inmates before). I've performed a lot too. \n\nAnyway, I'm considering going to school for music/audio production, because I feel like I don't know that much about the technical side of music; I don't know how to use all the software, how to manipulate sound, mixing, or anything like that. I want to try and get into the music industry, and I feel like I need to know these things to be a well-rounded musician. I've tried learning them myself many times, but it just never clicks. I went to college on VA benefits, and I still have some left, enough to pay for the majority of the 20-month program. I would like to use them for this. \n\nIn the event it doesn't work out, I plan on moving to Europe and going to grad school, and becoming a professor/teacher.\n\nI just wanted to get some input from people who have been there, specifically about these things:   \n\n\n\\-How intense is the 20-month program? How much time a week, homework and all, would I be spending? Would it be the only thing I could focus on for that year, or could I have a life outside of school? \n\n\\-What opportunities would I have for things like internships, apprenticeships, etc.? What opportunities would I have to network?   \n\n\n\\-How much freedom do you have with the projects that you make there? \n\n\\-What things will I be able to add to a portfolio by being there? \n\nWhat is the area like generally? Do people take Covid seriously? Do people get harassed a lot? How expensive is it to live? Also, an important thing, I'm pretty big into activism, what's the scene for that like there? Those types of things. \n\nAny input on those things would be greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "Hey! I am halfway done with my Sim Vis degree at Full Sail so I can offer at least a few insights.\n\nFirst off, I am on the 29 month program and in full honesty school still takes up almost 100% of my time, save for one ot Two months that were a little lighter on workload. The 20 month program will be tough but if you are willing to focus and put the work into it, you will gain from it and pass. Sure you'll have a life if you want to spend weekends resting but for the most part it's intensive learning all the time, which isn't a bad thing considering the 20 month bachelors program is just that, an accelerated bachelor's program that would take normal colleges 3-4 years.\n\nYour coursework will have you building a professional portfolio through your course as some of your classes, and if you dedicate your own personal time to it you will very likely be able to find some internships, especially since the teachers and lab professionals are well networked and experienced industry professionals themselves. You will have to work hard at it, but graduates from fullsail that give it their all usually have no problems finding employment once graduating.\n\nAs for project and portfolio building, at least for Game Dev and Sim Vis, once you get to those classes your are allowed almost free rain of your projects, but you work with a team of students in game dev/sim Vis so I am not sure how it applies to you. The first few months of classes are just to teach you how to do all of the things you need to do in order to be able to make a project, and it's not like they through you in the deep end alone either. You will have a teacher to guide you through the process and help troubleshoot, and when you finish the class and have a finished project it's fully yours, it belongs to you entirely.\n\nAs for the last question, I can answer some parts well but not others. Regarding Covid, the campus still requires masks and that you stay home if you are sick, and it looks like they will continue with those rules for at least the next two months. I'm not sure if people get harassed a lot for masks or whatever from living here, but the students and staff at fullsail are people that want to be there and are genuinely interested in learning, and connecting and networking with their peers. Granted, in the first few months you will have a lot of people that drop due to the fact that they come to fullsail expecting it to be an easy school to get a degree from, which it's not, and they will likely drop out or fail out.\n\nCost of living, especially alone, is not cheap. I am alone right now and my monthly expenses including food, utilities, and apartment, are around 1800. Orlando's housing market and living market is fucking insane, but if you have multiple roommates the cost can be lowered significantly. For reference I am in a one bedroom apartment about a mile and a half away from the school, and this was on the cheaper side of things for living. I do not know what the activists scene is like here, for the most part Orlando's population consists of old retired folks, college students, and tourists, and it's always raining in the summer so take of that what you will. \n\nI hope I was able to answer your questions. Europe has some great schools and it's worth looking it o them as well, but fullsail is a great place and you will learn a ton if you really want to do music production. If you have any questions, reply or DM and I'll happily try to get back to you. Best of luck!",

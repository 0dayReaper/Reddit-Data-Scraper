Teacher gave me a 0\n\nAlso last class I looked up something funny and the teacher blurted out laughing right when I typed it in \n\nSo proceed accordingly.",

I\u2019m not sure how you get a 0% on a zoom lab, since most of us watch the recording anyways. Maybe it was a mistake?\n\n100% zoom does NOT share your personal computer info/screen with the person hosting Zoom. That\u2019d be an invasion of privacy, and a serious concern for the FCC. They can see what you chat privately to students through Zoom, but that\u2019s different.",

If the lab isn't even a weighted grade, I wouldn't sweat the zero. Just e-mail your instructor (for your professionalism score) to cover your rear end and let them know you were present.\n\nAs for your suspicions, no. Unless you're sharing your display (which requires a few button clicks to setup) they cannot see your screen.",

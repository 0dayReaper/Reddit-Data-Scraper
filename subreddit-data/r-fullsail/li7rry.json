At the moment my current class has the option to attend an on-campus lab, which isn't worth it to me personally due to my commute- it's easier to just get help/feedback via Discord from my instructor. \n\nThere are simply too many things up in the air at the moment, with FL experiencing a rise in the new COVID strain and the government considering stopping all foreign/domestic flights in and out of FL.",

Full Sail is using pretty good precautions and stuff like sanitizers etc. I\u2019m not sure if the normal routine will start on march. But you can call them or email them they respond quickly and help a lot.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m officially 100% convinced that FS does not care at all about their students and Will go to any length to ignore student complaints. \n\nI have a professor for a class who did not give me a grade that I deserved based on the rubric. The rubric stated I needed 4 things. I provided 5. The professor decided arbitrarily that 3 of my things don\u2019t count despite the assignments instructions not specifying anything about what would count and the rubric simply stating that I needed 4 things and not 4 things that met a certain criteria. I brought this up to the professor and he threatened that he would look over it but in doing so he would drop my grade even further instead. I said \u201cI will take it up with the school as you are not grading by the rubric. Thanks.\u201d And he threatened me again saying that bringing it up with the school was unprofessional and he would count it as inappropriate conduct and dock my professionalism score for it. I told the school all of this and they completely ignored his threats and even told me that saying \u201cI will take it up with the school as you are not grading by the rubric. Thanks.\u201d was \u201cproblematic\u201d and that the course was designed to \u201cimitate the industry\u201d. What a load of horse shit. I have given up on doing anything about it since it is apparent that FS doesn\u2019t care and is fine with condoning this professors behavior.",

            "comment": "'threatened' is a strong word for this situation. It sounds to me like you either didn't pay attention during lecture, didn't look at provided supplemental material, or aren't requesting feedback/critiques via e-mail or discord before project submission dates. \n\nthe reason your 'professionalism' was brought into question was that you essentially said \"fuck you lead animator, I'm gonna go talk to the animation supervisor because you threatened me.\" Even if the whole 'imitate the industry' thing is horse shit, you still made yourself look like a complete jackass.\n\nI can go on for hours on things that I disapprove of within the university.. But this ain't it, chief.",

Spending your time and energy fighting this one assignment in one class about something so small is, in my opinion, a waste of your time. Be careful about this as you move into your career. Employers and creatives alike don't have the time for it and many can and will simply move on.\n\nI used to have this level of specificity and promptness in my assignments. I got points docked and realized how minimal it was in the grand scheme of my career. No employer **ever** has asked for my degree, GPS, or let alone my GPS. \n\nThe situation sounded like it could have been dealt with a little bit differently, and you absolutely deserve the same respect, time, and critique as your peers. I agree with you that Full Sail should look into this and act accordingly. \n\nUse this as a learning point and focus on the bigger picture: your career. \n\nGood luck!",

I could fill the library of congress with the issues I have with Full Sail from policies, communication, to teaching qualifications and so on. And I'm a fighter, I don't put up with sh*t. I have zero issues with confrontation esp when it's over something unjust. But at the end of the day I just need the degree to help my career change. So I shut up, put my head down and roll.\n\nUnless its going to negatively affect a scholarship. Just take the grade and run with it. No one cares about grades. Just get through it.",

Not a single tutorial on what to do. No rubric, the final instructions where to \u201crefer to previous feedback.\u201d Not a single assignment was graded until a week after class, was given 100% on everything and no feedback or suggestions on how to get better. Every time I called tech support for help they referred me to the teacher. In week 4 when I said I had but hadn\u2019t gotten any replies, they told me that I should\u2019ve told them sooner? And taken it up with academic advising\u2026??\n\nLike I could just watch YouTube and slap something together and call myself a professional at this point.\n\nI am going to escalate the issue to my program director, we\u2019ll see where it goes.",

But this school has a lot of issues and while I\u2019ve done my share of complaints in the most legal fashion and even quoting the student hand book but sadly it did not go far. With that said do what you think you should do but what I have learned is do what you must and move along with your classes. Full sail makes almost no sense and I recommend any future prospects from going. Great ads but it ends there. Seen a lot of students fall victim to its system of unfairness and poor teachers. You are not alone.",

I know is crazy and it's hard to contact/find him, but 5 years ago I was struggling so much with some stuff at Full Sail. I tried talking to their staff several times and no one was able to help me. I explained my situation over and over and they never helped me found a solution. Around that same time I was walking on campus back home one day and the director was passing by in one of those little cars for the staff/visitors. He offered me a ride due to my limping coz I have an injury on my knee. He was really cool and chill. We talked about my issue and seriously in no time it was solved. It was like he snapped his finger and boom that thing I was fighting for months happened just like that! He really listens and care about the students. Good luck and sorry for your situation.",

            "comment": "Most of my professors have been really great, especially if you communicate issues with them, and have always been willing to work with people and answer questions. That being said: I had one professor who was very condescending and nasty to me over a single misunderstanding on my part, automatically failed me in his class, and threatened to have me expelled from school. All because I misunderstood an assignment and submitted an incorrect assignment (this was in the Creative Writing BA degree course, I\u2019m not sure what one you are in though). \n\nThis is all to say, most of the profs are chill but every now and then there is one who is a massive asshole and it sucks, because when I went through my issue with the professor I had, I could not find anyone to reach out to regarding it and struggled having to take his class twice. And as it turns out, I looked him up on a date my professor website and people have continuously had similar issues with him, which makes me wonder if the school is just oblivious or purposely ignoring it.",

For me the course work is a little rough at some points but after each month I look back and reflect on the things that I never knew I could do before I started the class. I don\u2019t know about how likely it is for anyone to get a job once they graduate but that is because the school doesn\u2019t automatically give you a job. You have to do your part in finding and job. As for Full Sail student being frowned upon, I don\u2019t think that is true. After major movies, games, and even events, Full Sail shows a list of student who have worked in the projects. In the entertainment industry you will be hired because you are good at what you do not because you have a piece of paper that show you went to college. I hope this has helped any.",

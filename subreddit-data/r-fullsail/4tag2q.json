If I can't get a job in the game industry what other jobs looks for a person with a bachelor in science? 3. Is Full Sail worth $74,500?! 4. Would studios like Bungie, treyarch, etc. like to have graduates from Full Sail at their studio? \n\nThanks! ",

            "comment": "What's up. Fullsail Alum here. I started in Aug 2009 with Game Art and by March 2010 I switched to Digital Arts and Design. I graduated June 2012 (!) With that being said:\n\nIIRC Game design is a 12 months Assoc. Do not expect a Business-Card meriting position at any game development company with this degree unless you have serious game dev chops already, either through an extremely strong command of mathematics and programming, or Fine arts and character development. Or, if you just already have amazing industry connections.\n\nAnd I can't really say this enough- Fullsail Game Dev will only be useful to you if you Live, sleep, eat, and breathe mathematics. Don't? Do not waste your time and money because you will not succeed.\n\nSame goes for game art- Highly reccommend that you're already a skillful fine artist, great character writer, or generally a life long artist.\n\nFullsail uses your \"existing passion\" to kind of assume what you already know and don't know. This is where Fullsail differs from traditional colleges. If you go to a 4 year college for Game Design you'll spend a LOT more time on fine arts and/or programming and as long as **you understand the game development industry and you are successful AND you still enjoy it you'll find a good job**\n\nGame dev is not a great industry- you work a lot of gigs for long periods of time, get the boot and move on to you next project, usually at a different company- all the while struggling to earn a credit to put on your resume. You get stability when you play a pivotal role in the production of- or you create- a great IP.\n\n*That's my whole shenanigan about FS's Game degrees and game degrees in general- of all my friends in High School that wanted to do this and follow through, none of us have worked at a major company, and they tried MUCH harder than I did. I also don't recommend FS if you're right out of High School. ESPECIALLY if you didn't get to \"party\" much in high school. everyone is different, though.*\n\nHey if this all sounds like fire and brimstone, well welcome to life, it's an uphill battle.\n\nPart the deuce - Full Sail Career Development\n\nBottom line, you have to fucking want it- more than anything else in the world. The people that got jobs from fullsail did something like this (which is to say, I didn't.)\n\n*  With Six months left, start talking to career development every day. After the first visit, write a resume and bring the most recent copy with you every time to get help revising. Also start going to the club that meets for this same purpose as much as possible. Turn off your social life, this is your life now.\n\n* four to three months left, start applying like mad. Take phone interviews, take skype interviews. At this point, Fullsail may believe that you''re actually serious and they may begin sending you job leads. You'll find that you're 5th, 6th, 75th to apply by the time you get there, but you keep going\n\n* and maybe you will end up with a successful job lead from fullsail.\n\nFullsail has a lot of resources to help you be successful in your career, but you have to utilize them and you have to make finding a job your job. If you don't then the resources will be useless to you.\n\nAlso, if this whole shebang sounds depressing, this is a fraction of how the faculty will make you feel towards the end of your degree.\n\nI did Digital Arts and Design- which is a multi-concentration Visual Communication Degree (graphic design) And... I fucked up everything after I graduated, with mostly B- to C grades, I sat at home for 3 months before I tried applying for jobs, first opportunity to take a job was running proofs for an online printing website on the overnight shift (something ultra shitty, 3am to noon or something) and basically ended up working a shitty retail job for a year. I actually had a pretty good resume (I know because the almost exact same resume got me a real graphic designer job at a financial firm about two years later, but it was so bad I took a \"comeback offer\" from my old company where I worked in a warehouse to come back and do their marketing. I am really happy now and I am *actually doing a lot better than a lot of people I knew in High School* but I also have a lot of regrets vis-a-vis what I did in school, what I went for, and what I could've done instead. Fullsail is worth it if you understand how it works and how you can benefit, and then exploiting that for the maximum benefit- do not treat full sail like a 4-year, you'll end up with a shit ton of loans and not a whole lot to show for it.",

            "comment": "u/CrrntryGrntlrmrn makes some good points overall (heed their advice!) but they are incorrect about the current state of the Game Design course - it is a two year course (ish, 21 months or thereabouts I believe) that is *not* an associates but a regular bachelor of science - I think, I myself did not do it.\n\nIt will not be enough to land you a game design job off the bat, though - there could be exceptions but Game Design positions in the industry are the hardest to get into, as there are so few of those positions available. \n\nI myself am about to finish a game design master's of science and I have to accept the fact that I will have to take entry position roles - even getting a level or system design position will be lucky. QA roles and other grunt work is the reality for people nowadays who would like to join the bigger game industry studios as designers. \n\nSo to answer your questions:\n1. It will, but you need to work at it too. They have extensive connections and processes in place but they will not do it for you, they give you the tools to do it yourself.\n2. You could go into simulations, or educational games. Not as flashy but there is a high demand for people to develop and create these areas. \n3. I haven't done that course so I cannot say for sure. It's worth it in the sense that you are flung through a course to get a degree faster rather than waiting four years.\n4. Yes, there are many studios like that with Full Sail Alum to get them through the door (if you know the right people). To give you an example - Josh Hamrick who was a designer at Bungie for Destiny left for Bethesda to become a designer on Fallout 4, and was one of the brains behind their recent survival mode for FO4. How do I know this? I got in touch with him. \n",

Thank you!\n\n*A couple more things*\n\nWhen I went, they really beat it into your head that you're *competing* with all of your peers and classmates. Don't buy into this! (this goes for all college) Never let a teacher or a student with a shitty past beat you down to the point that you start to feel bad about yourself! \n\nIt actually turns out it really pays to befriend your classmates and peers because, one day they might get a great job at a company that is hiring. And they might ask their new hire something to the effect of \"Where can we find more people like you?\" Quid. Pro. Quo.\n\nThe tour is a lot of fun! - double edged sword. Go by yourself (My dad spent the whole day geeking over the film stuff... I was going for game art) and talk to the *course directors* -These are the higher up educators on campus and once you're enrolled they are difficult to wrangle. Just keep in mind part of what makes the tour unique is that **it is a sales pitch**.\n\nAnd sorry for the miscommunication on the degree proper, circa 2009 when I started there was the Game Art BS, the Game Development (Game Dev) BS, and the Game *Design* Masters. IIRC the Game *design* BS is a relatively new mashup of Game Art and Game Dev? not 100% on that.",

    "postText": "Hey, guys! \n\nI have been looking into Full Sail for the 3rd time in the last 7 years. First time around I had just graduated high school that was in 2011. I was talked out of going to school to be a music producer. Because there was no possible I could make a career out of it. \n\nFast forward a few years later and I was living in Titusville,  Florida and had just been married. Working for a church doing sound, audio visual. The church didn't know how to use their Mac or Pro presenter. So I learned it myself and started using it all. I was really enjoying my time there I really thought about attending Full Sail again but I was working full time and doing the stuff with the church and didn't have time. We got pregnant and moved back up north to be closer to family. \n\nNow we are at today worked with multiple churches doing the same things and love doing live audio, production in a studio type setting. Now I'm at a very large church that has an amazing media room. I have all the tools I could want at my fingertips and am working directly under the media director / sound engineer. He is awesome and I'm looking forward to learning more under each him. \n\nSo my question is, would the Full Sail Audio Production Certificate do me any good. I was looking for a smaller program so I could get my feet wet in the technical side and expand my knowledge base and make connections. I would love to be a studio producer I work in the it industry and as much as I enjoy it. I enjoy this more. Mixing and blending live and recorded sound. I don't believe I have time for the full bachelors degree working hands on at the church and full/overtime at my day job. I just wanted to see if this was worth investing the money and time in while working hands on at the church. Hope to hear from you soon! Thanks for taking the time to read this!  ",

            "comment": "TL;DR.... I am an Audio Engineer and I went to Full Sail. I have alumni friends that are killing it as producers.  This 5 month certification will give you an idea of what is out there and leave you with very few marketable skills.  If you absolutely have no understanding of recording or music production, this is a start. But you will need to find an internship or ask some studios to work for next to nothing so you can learn more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI proudly went to Full Sail for Recording Arts and Show Production. I also freelanced on the side and busted my ass off while I was there. Here is the deal about Full Sail, people are going to tell you to not waste your time with it. You will hear either \"My friend went to that school and said he didn't learn anything and didn't land a job, that school is a scam.\". Or, \" I worked with some people from Full Sail once, and  ... blah blah blah.\" Right. Well, yes. There is just an insane amount of shitty people getting pushed through Full Sail. But just like any school, just because you get a degree in something, doesn't make you good at it, nor does it guarantee you a job. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHands down, every live or studio gig I show up too, I am (usually) by far the most knowledge tech/ engineer. Seriously. I get pissed working with \"engineers\" who have no education and are self taught on the job. They throw mics all over the place on drums and wonder why they can't get a good \"tone\" from the room. This is were I teach the new techs the rule of thirds and why mic placement and phase actually matters. In the live setting, I also always find myself having explain to the 'this-is-the-way-we-always-do-it' guys (obviously with no real education in audio) why we need to tune the PA EVERYTIME. Don't even get me started on the IATSE Union.... the most bitter in all of the entertainment industry. Don't get me wrong, they can be some of the most skilled and knowledgeable workers... but they are the ones who will say \"I didn't go to school for this, and look at me\", right before they ask me to go take a smoke break. We hire them to work for us. I have never seen IATSE run FOH (lighting, video, or audio) in my gigs... It is always one of us. Do you see the difference? If you want to be the boss, and you have no skills now, you need to get educated. If you have no connections in the industry, go to school. You will make some there for sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy only concern is that I don't know if that cert will have enough info you are looking for. The certification is a small snippet of what recording is and it won't go far in teaching you how to produce or even how to work in a studio. What it will do, is teach you how to use Pro Tools, mics, audio interfaces and maybe give you some sort of direction on what kind of career you may want in the audio industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took those classes as they were included in my degree. Month 1 is an information session of the audio industry as a whole; you will learn about video game audio, movies, sound design, live audio, mastering, studio engineering etc. You will do normal college homework like writing a speech, working in groups etc. There is no recording or anything musical in this class.  Month 2 is learning the basics on how recording works.... nothing advanced here. Month 3 is intro to song writing. If you know nothing about music, this basic info is needed if you want to get out of live work and into the studio.... but it just barely scratches the surface and more studying, research, and practice will be needed to fully understand music theory. Month 4. Sequence and technology....Do you understand Midi and synthesizers? Month 5, Audio workstations. You sit in a room and mix pre-recorded Pro Tool sessions on an AVID S6. This class is really a dive into how to work with Pro Tools. It is a ton of fun and absolutely the main reason I would suggest this cert to anyone. But it is important to note, you are still not recording a band or helping write a song.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook. Full Sail can work for some, and others it might not. I have a personal friend that has written, recorded, mixed, produced and managed many bands since 2014 such as POD, From Ashes to New, Papa Roach, In this Moment, Five Finger death Punch ect. I have another friend who opened up a recording studio in Miami. I have another friend works with some of the biggest bands in the world such as U2 and is currently working with Shakira. I have a friend who a game audio artist and is the Lead Sound designer for EA Tiburon. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck! \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "I really appreciate this. This hits a lot of points I was hoping for! Like I said I'm currently not working at a studio however the church I'm in has over 5000 members  in a normal service. Tonight I will be sitting with the sound engineer I'm working under and doing sound check for the band.  So far he has been one of the most knowledgeable person I've met in a church setting doing this.  \n\nI will be learning more about the sound board we have tonight it's a dlive c2500. This place is equip to do live broadcasting and does every week. So I feel like i am really getting a good footing and access to premium systems to learn on. A lot about live recording in a larger venue. \n\nWould the associate's degree help me get into the swing of things on the technical side? ",

I'm going to do the certificate program to see how I do with their online studies if it goes well I'll plan to do my full degree there. Everyone see this as a dying job field and I really don't get it. Audio engeneers are need just as much as anyone else however they can fill in for live music, broadcasting, media applications for networks and movies, television ect. Not sure why there are so little jobs compared to well about any other job out there. ",

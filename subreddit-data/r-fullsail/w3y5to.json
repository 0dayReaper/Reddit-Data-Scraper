Full Sail does offer career fairs and virtual fairs that will have a number of companies attending looking for potential candidates. \n\nPersonally, I have had much much more success by networking with anyone and everyone in your field as well as well as other related focus\u2019. There are a number of Facebook groups both admin\u2019d by FS and others that are ran by industry heads. \n\nIf you\u2019re in NYC then look for studios who need interns, if you\u2019re not local to NYC - do the same thing then once you have some credits under your belt you\u2019d be more a more likely candidate for a larger facility in a preferred location. \n\nGood luck, keep at it, put yourself out there to try land some smaller artist\u2019s patronage. Your skills will do the talking, just gotta find someone to listen.",

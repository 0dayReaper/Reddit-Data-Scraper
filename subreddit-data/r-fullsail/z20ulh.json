    "postText": "Hey so, I\u2019ve been kinda of thinking about enrolling in FSU\u2019s Creative Writing Program because I was told it would be the best thing to look into especially with what information I gave to admissions. I really wanna branch out into the entertainment industry and possibly produce storyboards for television shows and videos games or at least play a big part in creating the story for them. If I did enroll, I would be getting my bachelor\u2019s but I just want to know how far that would take me or if I should try for something else.",

Some months are great but at least half are screenwriting focused, even with titles that suggest game design or comic writing. I highly suggest trying a different school for CW overall; the master\u2019s level of work has been incredibly easy when compared to that of my undergrad in English writing/literature. The only main benefit from FSU are the connections, but those can be made almost anywhere as far as writing goes.",

Current MFA students will still receive an accredited degree, but Full Sail has been instructed by the ACCSC to reduce new enrollments in the program and to be more stringent in which applicants it accepts.\n\nThe full report by the ACCSC is available here:  \n[https://www.accsc.org/UploadedDocuments/2022/Public-Notice/Redacted-Letters/Full-Sail-University-055214-SAL-Warning-Letter.pdf](https://www.accsc.org/UploadedDocuments/2022/Public-Notice/Redacted-Letters/Full-Sail-University-055214-SAL-Warning-Letter.pdf)",

In DCBS, when we got our cameras, we had a crash course on how to use it, and it was really intense (our camera is the Sony FS5 M2, it\u2019s got soooo many buttons). The good thing about waiting that long is that you get most, if not all, your Gen Ed classes out of the way, and then you just focus on your core degree program classes. I know at the beginning it feels annoying, but not having to break up a project to do an English or history class is actually really nice.",

It gets heavy into video editing later down the line and I personally dont enjoy it as much. Its very hands on you learn scriptwriting and all but also spend a ton of time on soundstages and play with lights camera sets actors etc. wrapping cables properly is a skill you\u2019ll need btw!",

            "comment": "It's basically a useless program.  Instructors reiterate the same garbage every month.  You will sit in lectures for 8 hours, and labs for 12 hours while learning nothing.  The way that they select student film positions is highly political. Save your money and go to a decent film school, preferably one that has a regional accreditation.",

    "postText": "Hi, I am a current student at another university studying 3D Modeling and looking to continue at FullSail for Game Art. I mainly want to transfer to FullSail to quickly get a degree and get out and start working in a field I love. I mainly want an accelerated degree to please my family and also be able to learn and produce work in a timely fashion. \n\nI wondered if anyone here could give me some insight into the Game Art program. Is it worth it? I would consider studying in person instead of online.\n\nAlso, if any people have transferred into FullSail, was the process of submitting transcripts easy?",

            "comment": "As someone who started the game art program with very little experience, I have learned a lot. But with the accelerated program you also learn a lot by just doing the work or teaching yourself. If you have the experience and portfolio the accelerated degree will help you to get into the field faster. Also the network you can develop with people striving towards the same goal is insanely helpful.",

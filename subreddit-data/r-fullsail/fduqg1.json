With some research though I can't seem to figure out how to tell whether a camera bag will fit my Sony FS5k in there or not.\n\nThat said though I also have no idea what the case that comes with the Launchbox looks like. I want a bag though that I could carry with me all the time that's got most of my basic gear with me, if anyone happens to know something good.\n\nThanks for the read/any help :)",

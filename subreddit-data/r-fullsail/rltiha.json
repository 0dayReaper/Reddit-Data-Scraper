Sorry this is a bit off topic, but I'm actually curious about the university's Media's Communications program. \n\nI'm an out of state student, and was wondering what the tuition/ overall experience is like for you so far. Hope yo hear from you soon!\n\nI also have an associates in Communications from a local community College, so if you still need help (although it has been almost a month since you posted this) with any current assignments I can try giving some advice if needed :)",

My original program was a degree program but some things happened to where I had to stop for a minute and they suggested I do a certificate program and then get back to my degree program. The tuition is actually not bad and they provide you with the tools you need for the program you are in. For example, my original program gives you an iPad and then a MacBook. Other programs get other things to help them as well. I really appreciate you wanting to help. I am currently doing an assignment where I have to make a press kit.",

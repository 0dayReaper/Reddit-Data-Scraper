    "postText": "Hello all, I'm interested in collaboration with a videographer in Orlando, FL. Preferably up and coming so that I could pay you and not kill my budget at the same time. To try to nutshell the situation. I am a local musician who is trying to do some on shot one location performance videos and basically editing those to be released as 1 minute clips. I've been looking for someone to work with, who I believe in there style. Also you wouldn't have to edit I have three editors and i also have a Panasonic Gh5 with a sigma 35-55mm lens, a Canon 80d, a black Promist 1/4, a GVM LED light, and a Godox SL60W. I also have access to another Panasonic a Gh4 and about 4 other canon's I just don't own them personally. I'm just trying to do cool stuff lol.\n\nI'm think shooting about two videos a month, shoots wouldn't be longer than two hours Making my budget about ($200) for 4 hours of work .",

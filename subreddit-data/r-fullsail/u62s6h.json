Are any of the tests proctored? As in you have a webcam recording you or a proctor watching you on webcam.\n\n\n2. If the tests are proctored then is it in house or through a third party program?\n\n\n3. Are tests open book or open notes and if not do they provide a formula sheet on the math tests?\n\n\nThank you so much just trying to get some info that I couldn't find anywhere else.",

You can\u2019t test out of it. I found the class annoying personally, it was easier than high school algebra. But they do have tutors available every day if you struggle with math.",

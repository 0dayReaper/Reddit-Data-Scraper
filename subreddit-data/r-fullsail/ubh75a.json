    "postText": "Hello, I am considering going to full sail for Computer Animation, and even talked to an advisor there, but I had some questions that I wanted to ask current and former students in the program. \n\nFirst is a general what do you think of the Computer Animation program, is it good, if so what do you like about it, and if not what don't you like about it? \n\nSecond is about the schedule, I saw people in other majors say online on reddit and youtube that they would have classes starting at 1am and 3am, is this the case with students in the animation major as well? \n\nAlso would you recommend the on campus degree program for Computer Animation, or the online degree program? Is the online program just as good as the on campus program, or is the on campus one better? (PS: I'm leaning towards the on campus program, but I wanted to know anyway.)\n\nFinally, would you say that you learnt everything you needed to after completing Full Sail's Computer Animation course, or did you feel like you still lacked the necessary knowledge or skills afterwards? \n\nThank you in advance!",

FS is great as it\u2019s structured well, and provides a structured schedule for you, providing great motivation to keep going. However they aren\u2019t prefect. If you don\u2019t supplement your learning a bit you\u2019ll walk away with just enough knowledge and skill for the industry, but to really excel you need to invest in yourself further. Ultimately you get what you put into the program, if you try to skate through classes you\u2019ll struggle a bit later on. \n\nI can\u2019t speak to campus classes, but I think they\u2019re generally anywhere between 7am-8pm eastern time. If someone had classes after midnight I wonder if they were online and in a different time zone, they\u2019re meant to be convenient. Online classes are also recorded and emailed to you if you can\u2019t attend live.  \n\nCampus and online are 99% the same, but campus degrees take about 2 years, and online is roughly 3. There are some classes on campus you don\u2019t take online, like Game Art had one with motion capture animation that would have been cool, but otherwise if you can\u2019t be on campus it\u2019s a great option. I will say this though, being an online student (one class a month) and working a full time job felt like working two full time jobs. Online or not YOU WILL BE BUSY! If you need to hold a job with 30+ hours I would consider online. Otherwise if you can handle two classes a month with the rest of your schedule being on campus would be an amazing experience.",

That classes sounds awesome, but it's good to know that other then that the online classes is still great, and having classes recorded so you can go back if you forgot something is good too! \n\n\nThank you for the information!",

                    "comment": "I'm interested in animating for TV and movies, so that's why I was looking at computer animation. \nI kept hitting a wall trying to solely use YouTube tutorials to learn and understand the basics, and I know I learn better when I have a teacher, so a while back I looked up apprenticeships for animation but couldn't find any, so I though they only other option would be college. \nPlus to work abroad, quite a few countries require a degree for visas, even the animation studios.\n\nFinding a mentor sounds awesome, but how would one go about finding someone to mentor them?",

Just respectfully chat them up on insta or Twitter or something.",

Design, help pages, anything of that nature. \n\n\nEdit: if you have the \"new reddit\" access you can visit alpha.reddit.com/r/fullsail to see what we are doing as far as design goes. \n",

Help pages and the overall design lend themselves well to giving off the idea of liveliness but retention is the problem because no one stays here for very long after they've gotten what they've come here for.",

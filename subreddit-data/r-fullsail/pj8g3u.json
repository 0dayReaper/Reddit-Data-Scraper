I\u2019d love to make friends and learn the area!",

I know people like to say \"the drivers from X are horrrrible\" but please believe me when I say that drivers in Polk County are the absolute fucking worst... driving on the highway feels like a gamble/free-for-all. \n\nAnywho, welcome to Full Sail! Lol I'm halfway through the computer animation degree if you ever need help in that regard. \n\n.",

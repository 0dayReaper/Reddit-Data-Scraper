You\u2019re going to learn the foundation of networking, system monitoring and security - you\u2019ll learn how to script with python which is a skill a lot of IT people don\u2019t bother developing. We learn how to write scripts to automate deployments, configuration, and system hardening. Once you learn it you\u2019re able to get things done so much quicker and you won\u2019t have to repeat those steps again - you can reuse your scripts over and over again. You\u2019re going to be a pro using terminal and commandline (bash and powershell). We spend a lot of time working with Linux servers and also working in cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure etc) which is great if you\u2019re interested in cloud roles like Cloud architect, devops, administrator etc. \n\nAs far as jobs go, I\u2019ve only applied to 5 jobs back in December and had 3 interviews (Cloud Engineer, Cloud Alert Engineer, and Integration Engineer) and the salaries ranged from $50k - $80k. I didn\u2019t move forward with either of them because I decided to get my masters first. My classmate had a job offer prior to graduating - Cloud Engineer $72k salary with a $5k bonus for accepting a job. He started 2 weeks ago and he\u2019s working 100% remote. It\u2019ll stay remote too after the pandemic - I\u2019m hoping to land something like that. If you want to get an idea of what kind of jobs to expect after graduation, go on Indeed.com and copy/paste these keyword with the parenthesis included: (cloud OR aws OR azure). Then use the experience filter and select entry level - there\u2019s thousands of jobs. I forgot to mention I also applied to Rockstar Games for a Linux System Engineer (for their online services) - they emailed me letting me know they had offered someone already but they\u2019d let me know when the job opens up again. There\u2019s jobs for us in every industry so don\u2019t limit yourself to just tech companies - we can work for game studios, film studios, - I\u2019ve even seen entry level linux engineer roles with SpaceX. Try to do your best in the program and really try to learn things the best you can, take the hard path and work on the the skills you hate - it\u2019s going to go by fast. I\u2019ll be around if you have other questions",

If they didn't offer them I was planning on obtaining the Security certs when the time came on my own, just to have them. My cousin has worked in the industry for 20 years and as a hiring manager he said he's not a fan of certifications, but a lot of people are. It's all about how you present them to your potential employer. Basically, put it on your resume but don't say anything about it unless you are asked.\n\nI start the Cybersecurity program on March 1st and I'm excited to get into it!",

I just wanted to go to a school (online as I don\u2019t live near the campus) and was thinking about using Voc rehab to actually transfer to the campus for Audio engineering.",

The classes are actually rather enjoyable and they do pay for the certifications you have to undertake in the courses. All account signups that normally cost money are free as long as they're partnered with Full Sail.   \nMy biggest complaint about the courses is that they feel a little too generalized in the beginning. There were a few classes I felt that weren't entirely necessary for the degree but I do understand why they had us take them.  \nOverall you would likely enjoy your time at Fullsail. They talk about how difficult their courses are as well, and I've breezed through everything with ease and am cruising at an average of low A's all the way through. Don't let the major numbers of dropouts scare you too much, if you're not as worried about the cost of your tuition. The tuition is terrifying, I'll admit but my rep helped me with finding so many scholarships the entire time and had even gone out of her way after their closing hours to keep in touch and help me out.",

I shoot video for a local subscription cigar co and I\u2019m currently finishing their third episode. Although my current equipment has done a decent job I feel like I still lack in the audio dep. \n\nWould like to to talk to anyone interested and wants to make 150-200 per episode. We can discuss more in person. \n\nYou can watch some work  https://youtu.be/nzHzB3rFn98\n\nAlso an opportunity for a second camera operator. We shoot with a Sony A7iii, A7riii and a Sony FS5ii just joined the arsenal. \n\nBeen doing this all by myself but the budget is opening up. \n\nDM me for contact info.",

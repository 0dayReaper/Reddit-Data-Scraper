Is there any graduates career fair to see student projects or anything for potential hiring? Seems way to difficult to get in touch with someone considering that the whole point of college is to help you get a job. Does anyone know of any point of contact?",

But in recent years, I think they have restricted it a bit more and not letting as many other companies in. I think there are other job fairs outside of that, but I can\u2019t remember when that is. Hopefully with the campus opening up more, more events will be brought back and they\u2019ll have more opportunities. I can try talking to someone here and see if I can get more information on the matter, if you want to give me your contact info and info on your company.",

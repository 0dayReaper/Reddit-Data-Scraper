    "postText": "I have 2 questions that I want answered.\n\n1. I wanna go for a tech degree. I saw all their degree options but I\u2019m stuck on which one to pick because I seem to like all of them. Career wise I wanna try being a software engineer or a programmer. I would also find it cool to be able to make video games whether it\u2019s design them or program them. So I\u2019m confused on which one would be the best one for me? What do you guys think?\n\n2. Is there anybody who is doing full sail online while active duty? If so what is it like? I was thinking of using TA to help me pay for it and maybe use the GI Bill to go for a second degree on campus. How would online school be like while active duty?",

Also we are sportscasting students so I'm sure that may be a less more time difficult than a tech degree.\n\nFrom my experience, you don't need to go to the live lecture. Most of the time you just need to watch it before the end of the week and write like a 3 sentence write up on what you learned.\n\nHope this helped! And thank you for your service!",

I would not have been able to keep up with this curriculum while active duty, but I suppose it depends on your branch and current duty station/op-tempo. Mine was pretty damn high at the time, so it's something you'll have to assess for yourself-- could you confidently handle an extra 25-35 hours per week of assignments and archived/recororded Zoom lectures? \n\nI know it's possible. Just make sure it's really want you want and be prepared to give it your all.",

They've been opening back up a lot more lately, but I just hate commuting &amp; having to fight Disney World traffic lol. To answer your question, though, it's been fine. If you thrive in a legit learning environment, though, it's a tough adjustment.",

I would recommend looking into what jobs you could get with what degree programs and see if those are things that you could see yourself doing. I\u2019m a little over a year into the online mobile development degree program now because I like programming and app development and I\u2019ve been enjoying so far. So yea, that\u2019s what I can offer on that.\n\n2. I\u2019m not active duty now, but I was for about 10 years. It would have been nearly impossible for me at my last command given our ridiculously long workdays and 3 section duty. The workload as FS varies from month to month and everything is computer based so if you\u2019re gonna be away from the internet for any extended amount of time, you\u2019re definitely gonna have some issues. Also, the work can be very time consuming at times so you could run into some time constraints based on how your command does workdays, duty section rotations, etc. The upside is that most months you only have one class (at least for the first year in mobile dev). So, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s impossible, but it will definitely take some strict time management and probably some coordination with your instructors.",

There are definitely students on the opposite coast though, and the instructors often remind students to be mindful of any time differences. Everything is based on EST so you\u2019d have to adjust accordingly. Also, a lot of classes are not mandatory live sessions and they provide recordings of the classes for you to watch at your convenience.",

Sadly he dropped out because the work load got to be too much for him.  However this was in 2012. I don\u2019t know if things changed. The school itself is faster than other colleges so you get your degree a lot quicker. Due to that work load depending on the course could be a little much. Even with working part time. I\u2019d have weeks where I came close to missing an assignment. Other weeks I\u2019d complete my assignments in just an hour or two. Overall the online stuff is hit or miss at least for what I did. I\u2019d say a good chunk of what I did was just lectures and reading and nothing really hands on. A lot of which was generalized.",

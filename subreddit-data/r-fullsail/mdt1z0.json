If you do not, then I suggest reaching out soon. AppleCare+ does seem to be in effect for a full year but nothing much after. You can take a look to see if yours does by searching the SN number on Apple.com",

If you haven't received it yet, e-mail student support. If you're in Computer Animation, really the only one you should expect is ZBrush. The rest of the licensing lately has been going directly through the publisher's site.. So you'll have to go to Autodesk and register (w/ your student e-mail) and request a student license for Maya.",

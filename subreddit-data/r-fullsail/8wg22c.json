    "postText": "But I'm confused about how the Gen Ed courses work. I don't see any mention of them on the website, and the online chat has been less than helpful, providing no real answers. I see that the launch kits aren't sent out for 4 months for online classes, are your Gen Ed classes done in the first 4 months? I'm thinking bout applying for an Internet Marketing bachelors, if that makes a difference. I appreciate any insight! ",

            "comment": "Hola! I've approved this post, but cant be of too much help. Your course schedule will be listed on the program's page. You'll be taking classes for the first 4 months that dont require advanced technology so that you can do it at home, the library, etc.  (most likely just word, PowerPoint, etc). I'm not sure if there is a program to get that technology right away, so that would be a question I would ask. \n\nOnline marketing is a good field! I'm doing my graduate program online for PR which is a different kind of marketing. Let me know if you have any questions about the content! The course schedule should help a lot too!",

I\u2019ve been lead to believe that they get the gen ed classes out of the way early, the first class I\u2019m currently taking is creative presentation and I think that\u2019s the standard first class",

Most you take early on, but there are still some sprinkled in the last year. The math class is the only tricky one, as you\u2019re required to use an educational online app. It\u2019s finicky and annoying, but otherwise classes are great.  ",

The Gen Ed classes as far as I understand, is basically your Humanities (how my adviser put it), I am in the Game Design Program but from what I can understand and please correct me if I am wrong fellow and former students; in my program (because I am not sure if all programs run the same) I'll first receive my iPad after my first month or so, and right before I finish up my Gen Ed class I will obtain my Macbook. That is all I understand from it for right now.",

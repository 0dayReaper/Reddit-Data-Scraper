    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all. \n\nIf you\u2019re a current student you may have recently gotten an email saying the national accreditation is on a \u201cwarning\u201d per the ACCSC (accrediting commission). \n\nMy concern/question was this\u2026 if we are not even mid way though our program and they lose this accreditation.. what do we do?\n\nNo one in their right mind wants to attend a university (or pay for that matter) for a degree that doesn\u2019t even have basic accreditation. \n\nI, like many, are worried about future funding, as the fed\u2019s will not fund traditional loans to a school that doesn\u2019t meet this criteria. I\u2019m also worried about existing loans. It would be absolutely horrible if we were stuck with these loans when the \u201cdegree\u201d we were going for suddenly became worthless. \n\nI\u2019m curious on everyone\u2019s thoughts.\n\nUpdate: Feel free to review the comments below this post. Moderators have pinned valuable information. This post was made shortly after the email went out, there has since been clarification.",

When she got on the line, I asked about the accreditation warning.  She said she didn't know anything about it, then put me on hold to go read the email sent out to students, and to talk to her supervisor.  When she came back, she said that I had nothing to worry about because this warning only affects a few degree programs, and the one I'm in, Game Design BS, is not one of them.  She said that the only game design program that was affect was the on campus Game Design AS.  Nevermind what the letter from the ACCSC said about the 24 other programs and 3 certificates all in jeopardy.  So since the \"supervisor\" told her to essentially cover it up, that tells me all I need to know about the school.  I'm looking into other schools while I still can.",

But that doesn't mean the programs are in trouble of losing accreditation anytime soon. It means Full Sail has to do some investigation and explain why they're beneath the benchmark, and they'll need to say what they're doing to improve that. Reread the introduction\n\n\"the Commission is interested in greater evidence of the school\u2019s assessment of the root causes of the below-benchmark student achievement rates, including programmatic, institutional, internal, and external issues. Identifying and understanding the causes is of significant importance in relation to the school\u2019s ability to also identify and develop effective strategies to improve student achievement outcomes.\"\n\nKeep in mind that this accrediting agency is for career schools. So for a lot of careers, it's easy for the schools to meet the benchmark. Paralegals, for example would have no trouble getting hired if they're any good at all when they graduate.\n\nBut most people know a lot of the Full Sail majors are in highly competitive industries where it's very difficult to get a job. And Full Sail may also be having trouble collecting data on employment, because people are not getting employed directly out of school. But rather taking 6 months or a year to find a job.\n\nAnd then keep in mind we just came off covid, which was not a good time, for example for getting a job in the music industry.",

A lot of people in my experience have shown up expecting something completely different than what they get because they had no prior knowledge of what making a game actually involves. I think my graduating class had an 81% mortality rate as a result of problems related to this, people just couldn't cut it. I am afraid if they cannot defend this that they will make the programs easier and diminish the quality of education overall just to satisfy the ACCSC. They have already made their grading scale easier recently, and now I am thinking this may have been the direct cause. I feel like the threat to the industry's perception of the quality of our education at Full Sail at this point could prove to be a significant issue as a result of this as well.",

                            "comment": "I\u2019m answering a very specific set of questions from OP - if they are mid way through the program, what do they do if the program loses accreditation. The answer is that the school, as a whole, is not in danger of losing anything, and their degree remains valid and accredited. ACCSC accredits individual programs of the school, each on their own educational merit (when they are created and during regular reviews by accreditor officials and 3rd party experts over the years they exist) and statistical results (ongoing). Their choice to end the accreditation of any program does not apply retroactively - if you earned a degree from a program that is subsequently closed, your degree remains valid, accredited and backed up by the accrediting body who approved the material and rigor of the program\u2019s approach to teaching it. They are choosing to end their accreditation of specific programs, but everyone who is in now and graduates still receives the full degree with full accreditation. Those are the facts of the situation. Anyone who graduates with the degrees at issue can still go into the world and say truthfully that they have a degree in what they studied. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a \u201ckumbaya\u201d thing - I\u2019m making sure people know the current facts of a confusing and slightly scary situation. If you\u2019re in a program, even one that is going to cease to exist, your degree still has the same value today as it did when you signed up and remains backed up by ACCSC as an accrediting body. Further, the knowledge you gain in the course of earning the degree remains relevant. The program materials that were approved and signed off on by the accrediting body have not changed. \n\nI understand that there is some fear and confusion here, so just wanted to share what I know to help people feel a bit more at ease. The school is not going away. It has been running over 40 years (during which accreditation has changed) and will continue to function. Yeah, a few programs didn\u2019t meet the numbers the accessories wanted to see and are ending. It mostly sucks for the faculty who teach in those programs.",

Calling yourself a \"university\" when none of your course credits transfer to other universities is misleading and confusing. It shouldn't be on the young college applicants to research the accrediting body and how it compares to others. This is especially misleading when press has been put out by full sail stating how the entertainment and music programs are great paths to JD law degrees. The challenge is finding any good law program that will accept your credits. This is coming from a 4.0 GPA Valedictorian btw...",

While I have taken responsibility for my part, Full Sail \u201cUniversity\u201d gets off scot free. \n\nNo school should be able to attain University status without proper accreditation. The fact that there are multiple types is a joke and a scam. \n\nAlso, recruiters lie and say that they will place graduates into jobs. They don\u2019t place anyone. They have a career development department, yes. However, they highly over exaggerated the role of said department.",

Also, [Linda.com](https://Linda.com) was a good source for material, Full Sail cut out graduates from access. Then, there was a lack of any communication or help other than a periodic email with links to upload a resume. He feels burned. He also stated that although there were some good teachers during his online course, some were not good at all. He had to complain to the uppers about that more than once. He is wondering if he has a shot in trying to get loan forgiveness for what he's heard about what is going on. But from his perspective, he hasn't gotten much help from Full Sail since graduating. At best they told him he could retake the classes free of charge. Any advice from you guys so I can send to him?",

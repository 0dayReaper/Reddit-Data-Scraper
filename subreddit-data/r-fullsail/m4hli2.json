            "comment": "As far as I understand it you graduate with a bachelor's in your degree of choice in 20 or 29 months as opposed to other colleges being 4 years. This is due to the fact that each class is one month and you don't get any long breaks like summer break, but it means that you get to build a strong portfolio and have work experience (due to your classes and their requirements) well before you graduate.\n\n Make sure you apply yourself to your classes though. Fullsail is not a school that you go to if you don't want to work hard and really learn, as people who come into the school thinking it'd gon a be easy A's often find out the hard way that it's genuinely a great place to learn. I myself failed one of my classes, took it again (you are allowed to fail and retake up to 4 classes before you start getting punished for it), and I have been doing really well thanks to that wake up call.\n\nIt's a great school! And it looks like more and more on campus stuff is opening up.",

Most likely what it means. \n\nI mean if you can do more go for it I spend nearly 5 days a week on school work compared to other colleges so idk if you can go any faster then there pushing students.",

You will be doing classes that are attached to an associates degree but you really can\u2019t get two degrees for doing one doesn\u2019t work that way. Example I got my associates first from another school. Now that same school I\u2019m going through the bachelors program to have a bachelors. Full sail I am just doing the bachelors. \n\nAlso full sail dose have a option if you go for bachelors and decided your done. If you have enough credits to get an associates degree they will attempt to switch credit around to see if it\u2019s possible.",

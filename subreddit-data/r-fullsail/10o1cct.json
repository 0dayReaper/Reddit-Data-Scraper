I've been doing a lot of research and there are a ton of negative reviews about the film program (the one I'm going into) and about how bad it is. I continue to read it's not a real class. People say it's a joke and you just watch YouTube videos the whole time and never actually create films. I also hear it's super intense. Are any of these things true?",

So I think if you've got a lot of money and want to really dig into your new hobby then it's pretty great. But on a moral level, they shouldn't accept student loans. You should have to pay up front for each semester you go. It's getting people into years of massive debt for a hobby college. Successful grads in the industry might protest to that thought but you can be talented in any hobby and build a career from it. I found out after graduating how little of my class worked in the industry they graduated in. The guys who came in and had already learned a bit of their craft, for fun, stood out significantly. I'd suggest taking up film making as a hobby for 4-6 months and start researching and learning what you can online. If you stick with it for a few months and want to push yourself further maybe you'll like Full Sail.",

Personally I love it, it's intense and you have to dedicate yourself to the work, but it's all up to you on how much you take from it.\n\nThe resources that are given are useful, and you should keep in mind how much of a market there is for your degree. Computer science is a good bachelor's to have alone, but with focus on game development I also have a niche I'm learning for. \n\nAll information can be found online, no matter what school you attend, but at the end of the day the degree from a university and the connections is what you're paying for not just the knowledge.",

I learned nothing I didn\u2019t already know. In fact most of the assignments that were handed out the estimated time I\u2019d spend is between 3-5 minutes doing it and be done. Where as others who were legitimately new to Pro Audio. Spent hours. At the price I paid for a degree that\u2019s useless. I could\u2019ve done so much more. Even if you\u2019re a newbie there\u2019s YouTube videos that\u2019ll teach you everything they did and so much more for free. I have a career now in tech which I already was doing at the time. It\u2019s just blossomed into something more. Having a degree from Full Sail never did anything and they never helped me get employment like they said they would. Granted I went in 2012. There weren\u2019t a ton of audio jobs that it even seemed when I looked on my own unless I moved out to California or New York but regardless I got a pdf of my degree, paid off my loan and haven\u2019t used it once. \n\nWhile I do have my own studio which I had when I went to Full Sail, and content create making pro audio related videos now. They had nothing to do with this.\n\nAlso to add about the whole it gives you a degree for employees to look at. While it might be true. I\u2019ve had jobs ask me where I went to college I say Full Sail and then it kinda just falls off. It would be the same if I want to Johnsonville Community College or Southwest Boston State University. No one\u2019s really ever pressed about a degree they just want to know that you went to college, any college, just in a college at some point.\n\nIf you wanna know anything else about my experience or the way things are taught there let me know!",

Videos recorded sometims with background noise, and just bad bad quality.  I spent a lot of time doing stuff you'd learn about in a community college like basic math, english, science, credits that were \"required\" but did nothing in the entire first year of the program. I watched probably more than half of my class either leave to a different program, or drop out entirely cause it wasn't what they wanted. I have heard its different in person, but having known a few peers who actually went to the campus who also happened to be in some of my online classes. They acted super disconnected with their overall opinion of Full Sail, almost like regret. Saying that it was bare minimum offerings from staff and programs at the charged maxium, to get the most out of you as a student financially. Like I said, I went for Pro Audio, which is much different than video game design, movie stuff, or even web/app development. Yet, I constantly see examples of everyone bashing the school in every field and class they offer. It seems like Full Sail really just died after the mid 90s.",

I\u2019m an \u201cexcellent\u201d student and earned a high GPA, but that does not mean much in the real world. Most of my instructors did the minimum they could. There were maybe two instructors who knew the game well and taught with excellence. Mediocrity plagues this school and it really has no real value outside of the structure and \u201cdegree\u201d in your hands. When it comes to this industry of entertainment and art, get hands on experience first. Certificates would be fine, but I would under no circumstances recommend FS to someone else. The only reason I went was to redeem my undergraduate performance. At my previous University (ORU, which is also a useless school to be blunt) I failed several courses. Instead of waisting time at another four year university which was worthLESS I decided to finish an accelerated degree here. This degree has helped me get into another Masters program at a better school and eventually a PhD program. Unless someone had a situation like mine, I would not recommend Full Sail.

            "comment": "I did the film program waaaaay back in 1994. Back then there were only two programs, film and audio, and some of our classes were done together. Of course, there was no online course, but I would have to imagine that would be a total joke because it makes a big difference being in person. I can honestly say out of all us who graduated, only a very small handful (I can think of 3-4) that still work in the industry. A lot of us initially went into the industry, only to be quickly disenchanted and realizing that maybe this was the wrong career move. The jobs I did land I DID NOT get because of my education at Full Sail, but rather, my hard work ethic and my willingness to hustle on the job. I eventually decided to go back to an in-state four year university and got my computer engineering degree. That degree did benefit me greatly, and I'm still using it to this day. I suppose my experience is hard one to judge since it was so long ago, but I do know many of us were saddled with a lot of debt for a long time (back then it was $17K for school), and it took a number of years to crawl out from underneath that. \\*IF\\* you go to Full Sail make damn well sure this is what you want for a career. I think many people (myself included) were young, naive and easily enamored by Full Sail's slick marketing, only to realize it wasn't a career we really wanted.",

            "comment": "If you're online, it's largely people proctoring your progression through recorded videos. The live lectures are many times a waste, just explaining specific questions and going over step by step instructions for assignments. It's hold your hand easy. I spent very little time on my work and had As. The big exception to my overall disappointment with Fullsail was Randy Baker - one of the instructors who is an absolute asset and wonderful to learn from. He takes his role as an educator seriously, is passionate and knowledgeable in his craft, and walks the walk with the industry connections that Fullsail touts in their advertising.\n\nI used by GI bill, so I wasn't concerned with price. If I was, I would be pretty upset, because the same thing can be had from Masterclass, Linda Learning, or hell,  NoFilmSchool.com who's videos comprise large chunks of Fullsails curriculum.\n\nMy hope is that folks that attend on campus get more out of their money, but I have my doubts.\n\nOh, also, if you hate being contacted unnecessarily, don't even reach out to then in the first place. I should have ran from the beginning.",

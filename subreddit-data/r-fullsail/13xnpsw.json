    "postText": "I graduated from full sail this March from the audio arts certification program and I\u2019ve decided to go back in the fall for my bachelors. Since I already have some credits my bachelors program is only 18 months long and all the pricing I\u2019m seeing is $60k for the 4 year program. \n\nSo basically my question is have any of you done the certification course and then gone back and done the bachelors, and if so, how much was your tuition? If you feel comfortable including scholarships, grants, and loans you got I would appreciate the info as well.",

Just the two-year accelerated program, in the comfort of my own home. After paying back my loan which took 7 years just about. It was around $70k.\n\nAbsolutely not worth it, for what you get in my opinion. Which I know you didn't ask for. Just like the other post said, if it takes you 20 years to pay off, you could seriously accumulate some serious interest; especially with the way America is at the moment going into the future. You could easily hit $100k+ on that $60k initial loan.",

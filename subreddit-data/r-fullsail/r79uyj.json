My other choice I wanted to do is University of Florida but the Full Sail campus looks amazing and it looks like a lot of resources are provided to students. If anyone could let me know about how Full Sail is and if it is worth my time would be great!",

There's a lot of maturity that happens in those few years after high school, and often times, you change focus. I regret not going to a public university first to hone in on what I really wanted to do while also maturing at the same time. Unfortunately, I blew an obscene amount of money on a college and degree that is now useless to me. I went to a state university after Full Sail and really happy I did. I needed those extra years to just figure out my future path. Full sail crams A LOT of information at you in a very short amount of time. You will have your entire life to work, no need to rush it! Just my two cents.",

But if money is no option and just want to go to a badass school then go to full sail. They have an amazing alumni in the industry and I hear they really do the most to help you find a job. I\u2019m currently enrolled in the online program and I love it. But I\u2019m also 31 and have had many years to fuck yo and find myself. I chose full sail to have my bachelors before I\u2019m 35 so I can be on my way to something great by 40.",

It is very expensive tho.\n\nJust keep in mind that a degree isn\u2019t necessary in the game industry. Studios aren\u2019t really looking for people with degrees, they\u2019re looking for people with experience and/or a portfolio. There\u2019s plenty of free/cheap resources for learning pretty much anything online. However, If you still feel college would be beneficial and are ok with the high cost, then go for it! \n\nThe one on one interaction with my instructors has helped me tremendously! The launch box they give you is great too.",

            "comment": "The campus is awesome, and the resources available to students are incredible. I am getting really close to graduating myself, about 3/4ths done, but I would say that if you are graduating high school soon you would greatly benefit from taking a year in community College near your home (so you don't have to pay for rent and stuff) to get a taste of what a normal-ish college life has too offer, and after that make the decision.\n\n There is no need to rush yourself away to any college right after graduation, but trying out different things in a place like a community College allows you to see what you want and what you don't want to do as a student and later as a career going forward.\n\nI had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do when I graduated high school and there was a lot of pressure from my parents to get into a great school, so I asked them if I could take a gap year to figure my shit out, to which they replied \"No\". I had already been accepted into a few colleges since I sent applications before I graduated, but I literally had no real idea of what I wanted to do, and I wasn't planning on wasting 40k to go to some college in a different state.\n\nA month went by before I really started to do anything regarding the college process, even though my parents were really focusing on my progress deciding. After some good discussions between me and them I decided that it would be beneficial for me and my parents if I went to the community College about a 15 minute drive from home, so last moment I drove over there, spoke with some admissions people, and became a student over the course of a few days, starting classes in architecture (something I was interested in as a career) as well as math and basic classes so I wouldn't forget them.\n\nOverall this was a good descision due to the fact that I didn't have to pay out the ass for tuition, I think I spent a total of 2000 for the year I was there, and by then I had tried out a bunch of different classes and had gotten accepted at Full Sail, so I told my parents I wanted to check the campus out and for Christmas that year me and my dad visited for a tour, he and my mom were impressed by the school and they told me that they would be happy if I went there.\n\nI started studying Simulation and Visualization about a year and a half ago and I am excelling in my courses thanks to the countless hours of work my teachers and peers have put into helping me learn. It has been incredibly hard but I am glad since it means I get to Kickstart my career and almost immediately get a job, hell I got some job offers on Monday that I'm considering.\n\nFullsail is a school that will legitimately fail you if you don't put any work into it, but much like anything in real life if you put effort into something you will see growth at an astonishing rate.",

I'm in a similar position: Graduated from a local CC, still not 100% sure where I'm going yet, but I do like the direction CC gave me, so I have a general idea.\n\nI'm really curious about the schools Media program. Online reviews are VERY mixed (you either love it or loath it) and it honestly sounds like you have to get around your professors just right, very similar to a community College, or I would assume any college. Sometimes you just have \"that\" professor, the ones who hate without a cause and will fail you if they have a bad day. It almost sounds like the majority of professors are like that there. Is that true from your experience? It is a private school, so I would assume most students say this because they never expected the pressure. Am I wrong?\n\nHope to hear from you soon! And again, thanks for posting this!",

            "comment": "So here\u2019s the thing\u2026\n\nI did not rush into college right after high school. I took the \u201cwork in the field\u201d approach and thankfully it\u2019s really paid off. Now this is my second time through college, and I\u2019m loving Full Sail. \n\nExperience trumps a piece of paper (degree) anytime. However that piece of paper makes opening doors much much easier. \n\nAs others have mentioned Full Sail is 1. Expensive, 2. Very fast paced. \n\nI am a quick learner and I love the pace, therefore it works well for me. I am also older than most and by now in life my time management and long term goals are very clear. That\u2019s not always easy when you\u2019re 18-20 trying to get the footing right, you know?  \n\nNot saying you\u2019d have a bad experience at FS but there are plenty of options! \n\nLastly\u2026 I understand why some people will bad mouth Full Sail. They are conditioned by \u201celitist\u201d who went to state to believe that their \u201cnon profit\u201d state schools are all holy. I\u2019ve got news for them\u2026 all schools are for profit. I hold a BS from The Ohio state University, and soon I\u2019ll have another from a Full Sail. What it all comes down to is your takeaway from the education. \n\nThe best teachers cannot help those who are unwilling to learn, period. \n\nThe way I\u2019ve viewed things is as follows\u2026\n\nIf someone is going to judge me negatively for my degree before even speaking to me then that speaks louder on them / the company than anything else. Thankfully, everyone I\u2019ve spoken to in my industry just thinks it\u2019s cool that I\u2019m getting the skills needed to thrive in this field. Also, I\u2019ve heard more good about FS grads than non. \n\nSo whether you go to a community college, state school or a private college\u2026 just give it your best. You\u2019ll be glad you did.",

Was told my scholarship would still be available (it wasn\u2019t, so we had to pay $2,000 the week before school started.) Eventually, I had to stop going because I wasn\u2019t able to get anything done, let alone the drama.\n\nThen, about two years later, I looked into Full Sail because I wanted to become a screenwriter. They accepted two of my classes from community college, and I took some of their required basics in the beginning (mind you, I was in the Media Communications program first, it was great, but it didn\u2019t really help with what I wanted to do, so I switched to Creative Writing.) I am using student loans and one of their scholarships, along with whatever pell grant I have left. I\u2019ve been taking my classes online and it\u2019s been going smoothly imo. I\u2019ve been taking one class per month, and as for someone who was recently diagnosed with ADHD, it makes a lot of sense as to why it works great for me.\n\nI feel like it\u2019s really what you make it, meaning if you put in the effort and enjoy what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019ll be worth it. I\u2019m 25 and I am so excited to be attending Full Sail. You\u2019ve still got time to decide, but once you\u2019ve started applying, make sure you talk to the student advisors at Full Sail, they\u2019ve been extremely helpful to me! \n\nGood luck!! Have a great Junior/Senior year!",

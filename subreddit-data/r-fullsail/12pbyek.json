    "postText": "Any cartoonists out there have a desire to break into YouTube and looking for a way to start? \n\nI am an Orlando local with an established YouTube channel looking to take it to the next level. I do creepypastas and true crime story narrations but would love to add a cartoon/animation element to it. \n\nI\u2019d prefer for the collaborator to be around the Downtown Orlando/ Winter Park area so we could actually meet up in person and strategize on how to grow this thing together. I\u2019m not just looking to just hire someone. I am looking for a partner.\n\nHere is the channel: www.YouTube.com/freakyattractions",

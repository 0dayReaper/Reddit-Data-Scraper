    "postText": "Hey everyone!  So I am about to finish a bachelor's in Management Information Systems and I am considering my options to further my education.  Game design/development is always something I've wanted to learn and I am curious if anyone knows how the graduate programs at full sail are.  I am considering the Game Design graduate degree starting sometime next year.  Is this a good program?  Would this be good considering I have little background in game design?",

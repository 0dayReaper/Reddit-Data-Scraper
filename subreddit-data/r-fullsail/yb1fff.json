    "postText": "i had to go on leave about a year ago due to financial and mental health reasons causing me to fall behind in my computer animation course. \n\nthe main thing i want to know is what to expect with the re-entry process so i can plan for it better. \n\nalso the hardware provided in the launch box has changed since then and i\u2019m not sure if i\u2019ll be required to switch out my macbook for the new laptop or if i\u2019ll have to be on a different version of the software from everyone else. \n\ni understand that these are questions that i can schedule a call for but i\u2019d like to know if anyone can tell me the real deal since full sail employees make everything sound good sometimes.",

BS in GD\nI am told that my launch box will consist of a MSI G7 Raider, An Apple Ipad , VR headset, as well as associated software.\n\nThis will be my first time going in I am eager to understand as much as I'm able to.\n\nI hope it helps.\nAnd despite what is going on I hope that in your real life that you take care of yourself above All Else.\n\nTimes are tough indeed and people fail to realize that we have a lot going on.\n\nI wish you the best and please keep us posted on how you are doing",

                    "comment": "The launch box is correct. I started back in March I think. The iPad is the first thing to come in and we haven't used it. I guess it makes it easier than using a phone for classes. I had an Asus before I started so I just used it instead. At some point you get the laptop and it is without a power house. I was playing 2018 god of war on it on full graphic setting with zero issues. The vr headset is neat however I liked the oculus better. The hp connects to the laptop effortlessly and gives you access to steam but for as I can tell we aren't going to use it in the course but I could be mistaken.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am entering high school next at the end of summer and am very determined to get into full sail with a degree in game development. I am currently reading a book on Unityscript with hopes of starting C# or C++ soon. I'm trying to make most of my classes as technical as they can be, my senior year I've decided to take an extra math course and a 3-hour program in which I shadow a programmer in C++, my counselors suggest that I take an extra class of science, but I have no room with the shadowing program. My question is if Full sail would value  the shadowing program over an extra year of science or if I should make room for science?\n\nSorry if I seem ahead of myself, thank you in advance :).",

Full Sail isn't too picky about who they let in. Any experience you can get with C++, linear algebra, or physics beforehand will be valuable but not necessary. \n\nIf you choose to go to this school work hard and stand out. Don't just do the bare minimum. Challenge yourself, soak up absolutely everything you can and make sure you put maximum effort in at all times and it will pay off!",

            "comment": "Full Sail values $. They won't really care about your shadowing or how much experience you have, as they generally are dealing with people who have 0 programming experience. If you got money, or qualify for a loan--they want you. If you do all of these things you're claiming then by your senior year you could get into a very prominent game dev school like Digipen. Full Sail should be your last resort. ",

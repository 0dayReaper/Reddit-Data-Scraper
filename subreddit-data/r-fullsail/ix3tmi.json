Go to an actual school or university as full sails degree is not accredited.

It does hold weight but if you are going from one accreditation to a different one you\u2019ll run into the same issue regardless of what college you enrolled into for school. \n\nIt\u2019s easier to transfer from a nationally accredited school like Full Sail to another nationally accredited school. Where as it\u2019s easier to transfer to regionally accredited to regionally accredited  schools. \n\nFull sail is a legit school. Yes it\u2019s a for profit school, but it\u2019s still legit. \n\nWhen did you go to Full Sail, how long ago?",

            "comment": "I'm in the Cyber Security program, about halfway through at the moment. I was told that the program would be broken into two different parts when I started, this was December of 2020. The first of which I will be \"graduating\" from in about two months. This may be because the program was new and it's weird (the enrollment specialist told me it was weird). I will graduate first with an Associate's degree. Right now I'm filling out stuff for that degree's graduation, I'm mildly confused. There's a lot of screaming. Most of the first half of the program has to do with servers, networks, and virtual computing. The classes are fun and challenging. Some of the instructors are helpful. Most of them will help on assignments if you genuinely get stuck on something. Others will refer to either the lectures or external resources very vaguely. I can't speak to the second half of the program, the first half wasn't so bad.   \nWould I recommend it? Probably not, I think it fits well for me, I am going to the school online because it's a quick 2-year program, and I'd recently become a parent. I've been very lucky in having a job I can work through a lot of the courses during downtime. I will be trying to get an IT job at the company I already work with and could use this and my experience at my current company as leverage to move forward/up. That's not to say the school itself is bad, or that the education I got wasn't worth the student debt. I think if you attend online you miss out on quite a bit of additional opportunities like labs and things of that nature, there are times I wish that I decided to attend a local university in my state for a degree instead of doing an online one with Full Sail.  \nLike many of the others have also said, do some research on the accreditation. I'm not overly concerned about it myself as I'm going for leverage with my current employer, and have my mental maths going for how I benefit from having a degree. You may benefit from going to a local college, or going on campus if you do decide to go to Full Sail. Best of luck to you whichever way you decide (or decided, I know this is over a year late) to go.",

I've had the opportunity to network a ton, see loads of guest speakers (both grads &amp; non-grads in the industry) and even have made a direct connection with a senior animator at Walt Disney Animation Studios. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlternatively, I've seen people just show up &amp; put forth no effort.. And they typically flunk out or get stuck taking the same class over and over again until they get their head outta their rear-ends.",

            "comment": "With online classes you should treat that number as an expected amount of time that it will take you to do all of the following combined, per week:\n\n* Study\n* Independent Learning\n* Watch lecture material\n* Interact with students and required posts\n* Homework including projects\n* Tests\n\n\nIt\u2019s of course a ballpark. Some weeks you will require more, some less. This will depend on your mastery of the topic, the effort needed for the projects, and of course, test taking time. \n\nNo one here can really answer what you\u2019re going to need from class to class, but it is critical that you do make sure you\u2019re blocking out and devoting the time you need. \n\nI highly recommend making an excel sheet, having each cell representing 30 minutes, use this to make a calendar of dedicated time that you know you can commit to weekly. This really helps also reinforce for yourself set aside time for the school work.",

I work 46.5 hours a week (53 recently) they were told this up front and I said I wanted to start at a later date but they pushed me to join in January. I print off my assignments, read it, make a list of what I need to do (they already have this usually in the weeks course) and just do it, takes me around 10 hours max a week.",

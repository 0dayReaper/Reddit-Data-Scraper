    "postText": "Hi I was wondering if anyone here has taken advantage of the Chapter 35 benefits offered by Fullsail and what the VA considers our enrollment status (Full-Time, 3/4 Time, Half-Time,)? Since we're taking 1 course per month (3-4 credit hours) but a full-time credit load each term/semester (12+ credit hours) it's a bit confusing.\n\nUpdate: Called the VA education benefits hotline As an online student it's being considered by the VA as a full-time payment (at least from february 28th-March 27th) Fullsail initially told me \"less than half time\" so idk exactly what they were on about since they new I was talking about chapter 35 rates and payments.",

Like someone said before, feel free to call and speak to the veterans rep. They\u2019ll answer any questions and support you if needed throughout your time at fullsail.",

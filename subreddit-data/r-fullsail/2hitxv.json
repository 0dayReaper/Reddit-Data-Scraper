    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm sure you get these questions a lot, but I've been trying to study up on Full Sail for the last few weeks, and I can't seem to get any actual consistent information. I figure the best people to ask are certainly the people that have gone to FSU. I want to go for Music Production. I have been pursuing Music Production for most of my life. I know it's what I want, and after working without any formal training i'm looking for some real direction.  Is this the place to go? What should I know about it? Thanks.",

            "comment": "I'm six months away from finishing my Recording Arts degree at Full Sail. Here's what you need to know:\n\n1. It's fucking hot here.\n\n1. People will tell you Full Sail isn't a real college. It is - it's a trade school. It isn't the same as UCF or other colleges in the area.\n\n2. People will tell you that you're wasting your money. If you're going to college to limp through and get fucked up and have a \"college experience\", this isn't the place for you. The schedule quickly becomes high-octane-no-bullshit serious, increasingly so as the program continues. There's one class a month if you're in extended, two classes a month (mostly) if you're in accelerated. Each class has about 80 hours a month of in-class time. (Some have 76, some have 84 or 88.)\n\n3. Lectures are four hours long. Labs are four hours long. There's a half hour break in the middle that some teachers extend to 40 minutes. 8-hour days (lecture followed by lab) are common. 12-hour days are not uncommon. 16-hour days are technically possible but I've never had one. This is every month until graduation. \n\n4. Full Sail has an attendance policy: if you miss more than 10% of the hours for a course, you fail (unless theyre excused with documentation). With documentation you can miss up to 20%, and you do makeup work next month to \"nullify\" the excused hours. If you miss over 10% (or you don't make the hours up), you fail the class for attendance regardless of your grades. If you fail a class for your grades (even with a 0%), you can retake it for free. If you fail for attendance, you have to pay to retake the course. That isn't a typo and they aren't reversed. \n\n5. The teachers here have all done this for a living. Some successfully for a long time, and some briefly before finding a teaching position. Not every lecturer here is built for teaching. Sometimes you teach yourself a little bit. Frequently, there will be no new information in lecture and you'll learn everything you need to in lab. (They can show you Pro Tools all day long but how much are you really gonna retain until you start using the program?)\n\n5. With that being said, some of the instructors here have legitimate claims to fame in the audio world, producing or engineering a long list of albums that have gone platinum. These people will go out of their way to help you if you give a shit about the course content and the work as a whole. If you don't give a shit, they'll give you your grade and send you on your way, which is how the school garnered it's reputation. The connections are invaluable and can't be overlooked.\n\nPeople burn out all the time. You have to be built for this schedule (which they will say mirrors your work schedule when you graduate, and it sort of does, but in the real world you don't have to listen to an engineer ramble about Pro Tools routing at 9am every Monday morning). My first class had well over 100 people in it. A lot of them thought Recording Arts and Audio Engineering were Phat Beatz 101. A lot of them didn't make it six months before failing. (And that first class, Digital Literacy, will make you question your decision to come here, because it is fucking stupid.)\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.",

A lot of being in class just to say you were in class for the 4 hours.",

Pro Tools is definitely the main program but Logic is also used at times. Lecturers and lab instructors will know a good amount about other programs if you have any questions.

            "comment": "Full Sail grad here\n\nNo, Full sail isn't a 'scam' per say, but I definitely would not recommend it unless you have the military or rich parents paying your tuition. The military paid my tuition, but I'd say ~95% of my classmates have $120-150k in student loans. \n\nLast I checked tuition was like $84,000. And that's BEFORE all the money you will have to take loans out for to live off of for ~2 years. \n\nThe music biz doesn't particularly pay well. It's mostly blue collar jobs. \n\nI cannot in any good faith recommend taking out $120k+ in loans for a job that pays maybe 30-50k if your lucky.\n\nI have dozens of friends on my facebook feed that went thru the recording arts program and work a shit job all day to pay the bills, and then at a studio at night that maybe pays minumim wage...if you're lucky. Many friends of mine have totally left the biz in pursuit of a 'real' job. All the 'successful' recording arts people I know realized that live sound/lighting/corporate av is where the money is at. I know of exactly ONE person, the top grad in our class, that actually became successful working in studios. \n\nPro tip- there are no more studios. They are all closing as you can do everything on your own now with a laptop and pirated software. No more need to go to a million dollar studio. And when Full Sail is pumping out 100 grads a month all trying to go work in any studio available, its just not gonna happen. The market is flooded. \n\nThe only program that is somewhat worthwhile is Show Production and Touring. This is what I got. There will always be work. But still, having a $600-1000 student loan payment every month for the next 10-20 years is going to seriously damper your quality of life. \n\nIf anything, go to a 'real' college to learn music. You do not NEED to go to Full Sail if you are smart. You can teach yourself everything you need to know via books and youtube videos. \n\nI know you're not going to take my advice, because Full Sail is all shiny and has big promises, but it's the truth. \n\nI'm currently working on a second engineering degree and prob wont stay in the biz. Maybe it's my location (Miami), but after 3 years I have yet to find any kind of stable or decent paying gig....And I work for the best sound and lighting company in the city at all the most famous clubs and biggest sound systems. If I wasn't so passionate about it, I would have quit a long time ago. But eventually you realize that it is nice being able to pay your rent on time. \n\nI still get laughed at when people learn I went to full sail, because everyone in the biz I know got there thru hard work and networking. If you really wanna learn music production, get a real job and learn music production as a hobby. \n\nIf you STILL are convinced you NEED to go to school, go to one of the other music schools for ~$20k. You will learn the same basics and have the exact same opportunities. Paying for a full sail degree will only get your foot in the door. Beyond that it's up to you, your drive, and motivation. \n\nThink of all your favorite producers and musicians. Did any of them go to Full Sail? Hell naw! They got to where they are thru hard work and self discipline. \n\nI know it's not the advice you wanna hear, but there are many better alternatives out there. ",

I'm not too far into it yet, but I'm digging it so far. \n\nI've been a musician all my life, and I've done quite a bit of producing with the bands and artists I've worked with as a drummer.. so I thought that this program would be a great fit for me. \n\nIf it's something that you've been doing, and you enjoy it.. I say do it. What's it gonna hurt to learn more stuff? \n\n\nOn a side note... I know quite a few students and instructors from Full Sail (I lived 10 minutes from there for a long time.. now I'm 2 hours away). The people that were serious about learning ALWAYS did well, and have done well after graduating. The ones that just go there to screw around and make beats.. they're stupid. They usually drop out or fail. Hard. \n\nSo, just stay focused and you'll do fine. \n\n",

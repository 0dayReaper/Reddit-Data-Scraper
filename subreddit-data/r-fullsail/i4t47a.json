Is there a discord or something where I can talk to people? I know there\u2019s the Full Sail Armada discord, but that seems to only be for e-sports. Thank you!",

As others have mentioned, there's a housing department that purely focuses on student accommodations.  \n\n\nI never used it because I was in the process of buying a house down here, but I think FS automatically put me in a housing list because I received a text message or two from random people about to attend FS that were in need of a roommate.  Thankfully that only lasted a day, I called FS and let them know that I don't need housing and they removed me from the list.   \n\n\nDoes FS making finding housing easy? From what I've heard, yeah. But as far as having sort of a platform/group chat/forum for future students goes, I don't think one exists.",

Currently, you'd be luck to find a 1 bedroom at around 1200$ a month that's decent to live in, so why not just learn back home and get the degree while saving money.\n\nGraphic design might be somewhat the same in that regard, however I can say that the campus life is pretty damn good, if the price of living here was cheaper than it would be 100% awesome.",

I have a BFA from another school and everytime I apply for a job on linkedin there are 200+ applicants for a junior designer role and 20% have a master's degree because they can't find a position for their skill level so they invade the lower level jobs. Now people expect years of experience for an entry level position.\n\nEdit: spelling, clarity, general phone keyboard nonsense.",

I have a B.S, and now everyone who's graduating has 3 to 4 years of an internship (experience), ongoing with 5 or sp basic certs, and a few higher level expensive, mortgage level certs (think SANS institute). The academic climb makes it hard for everyone, and in most fields. \n\n Yes, digital design is very saturated. You'll still make money if you get into it, but it's a lot more about who you meet and rub shoulders woth then it is about what you can do. Who you know is far more important. A law degree from Oregon doesn't differ much from a law degree you would get from Harvard, outside of it just being Harvard. You learn about the same though. But the people you meet, and the ones that came before you, you'll have much better time as a Harvard grad. \n\nAlso, Florida is in general an expensive area to live with low pay, like a lot of the south. In Oregon, your average two bedroom where in live is about 1400. In Portland, that's a studio apartment. If you're livingocal, your best bet is to not live too close. Commute 30 or 45 minutes outside of school. The prices drastically drop down the further you get away from the physical school.",

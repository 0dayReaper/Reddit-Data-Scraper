I think every degree that requires a MacBook gets the newest version out.\n\nIf your going for a certificate, you\u2019ll get your launchbox 4th week of first class. \n\nIf your going for a degree,  you\u2019ll get it after general courses unless you have transfer credits.",

Last week I was talking to the school about switching my major and was told i would I have to return the MSI to swap it for a macbook. I asked which model macbook i would receive for the digital arts degree and was told it was Macbook Pro with an M1 ultra chip, 12gbs ram, and a 512gb ssd. When I tried to look it up, i could not find any models matching those exact specs. Ultimately, I decided to switch to game design instead after learning a more about the degrees. Luckily, this degree also uses the MSi launchbox so I get to keep everything.",

They told me it was not an option to keep the MSI launchbox since I would need the MacBook for the Digital Arts degree. I have 2 MacBook airs and a MacBook pro sitting on my shelf currently, so I really don't need another one. They told me that I would have to send it back via UPS or drop it off at the school and that my major would not switch over until they receive this launch box back. I was pretty frustrated and asked to keep this one and decline the macbook as well as possible just adding the extra cost of the MacBook launchbox to my tuition and I would take both launchboxes but they said no to both of these options and were actually kind of rude about it. Eventually I caved and agreed to return the MSi so they tranfered me to admissions to get everything processed. I expressed my frustrations to admissions and the lady I spoke with went over the different programs and I decided game art is really where I wanted to be. I\u2019m online currently on the flex schedule since I live an hour away but haven't really been to the campus yet so she recommended I do the next behind the scenes game art tour get a better idea of the program and then I can decide if I want to switch to anything so technically, I am still in game development.",

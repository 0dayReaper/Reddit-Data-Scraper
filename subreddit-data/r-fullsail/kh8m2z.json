    "postText": "I am currently in month 2 of my computer animation degree. I still have about 3 months till I receive my launch box. The drawing tablet that comes with it is a Wacom Intuos pro medium which does not have a display. I\u2019m considering getting a Huion Kamvas Pro 16 because a Wacom Cintiq is too expensive. Has anyone tried animating on a Huion before? Any suggestions on a better tablet that\u2019s affordable?",

            "comment": "I\u2019d say try to stick with the Intuos that comes with the launchbox first. While having a screen to draw on is good, I won\u2019t recommend it unless you can set it up in a way you can draw comfortably without hunching back for extended periods. Once you get used to the drawing tablet, you\u2019ll find it easier to use while sitting upright.\n\nBut if you really want to go for a pen display, just save up and for a Cintiq and the proprietary stand or a monitor arm. Huion and X-Pen are good budget options, but from what I hear a lot of people couldn\u2019t attest to the longevity of their products.\n\nI\u2019ve been using the Cintiq 16 for half a year now and I have no complaints. Recently installed it on an Amazon basics wall-mount arm to help my posture. Pretty good experience so far.",

            "comment": "As someone who had a cintiq 13\" and now has a huion kamvas, I really do recommend huion as an alternative to the cintiq. However I do agree with another comment that just wait until you get the one from the launch box, mainly for the posture. I still haven't found a comfortable situation with my kamvas. If you go down a texturing or modeling preference, the display tablet would be handy but you can't really tell your speciality until you get through a majority of the classes. Personally, animating for me was better with a keyboard and mouse, but everyone is different.\nTry the tablet that comes with the launchbox for a while through the classes and see how you feel later down the program.",

    "postText": "I know for some classes like mobile development, we need multiple\ndevices to test with, or maybe graphic design, being able to use an apple pencil makes life easier, but take game design as an example, unless we\u2019re making mobile games, what\u2019s the purpose? That\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t enjoy having an iPad, but I can\u2019t see the reason for the school giving every degree candidate one. I mean I take online classes as an example, I already have an internet device able to do work from.. and we get MacBooks and HP workstation laptops later. The only reason I could think of is to maybe make work easier/slightly more portable?",

It\u2019s sometimes easier for me to edit projects and do homework or reading on (bc I haven\u2019t gotten the MacBook yet and my laptop is very clunky). I\u2019m in graphic design so I do use it for drawing sometimes. My boyfriend is in digital cinematography and he barely uses his iPad anymore.",

Now, this is on the online side of course. I am not a campus student so I can not speak for that but the online side will give students without other means the ability to access the FSO platform to view and complete assignments.",

I\u2019m currently 6 classes in (I got to skip one due to prior college courses), and I\u2019m loving it. I actually never did use the iPad, but that\u2019s because I had a better one already at home and upgraded soon after as well since my degree is graphic design.",

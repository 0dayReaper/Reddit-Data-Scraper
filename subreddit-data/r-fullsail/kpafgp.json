    "postText": "Hello! I'm a Freshman at UCF this year, and a few friends and I are working on creating a 3d video game together. We've got all areas, such as coding, 2d art (concept art and UI art), story, character design, and other general design pretty much covered, but we're really lacking in the character modelling area. We'd love to have a student who'd be willing to join the project hop on and join the team! Again, we'd be able to cover the character design, concept art, and anything else, and the modeler would simply need to create the actual meshes of the characters for us based off of the concept art (unless of course the modeler would like to be involved in the other parts of the design, in which case they are more than welcome to!). We'd even be able to handle rigging and animating the character if the modeler is not proficient / comfortable in that area. We don't have too much money, but for the right modeler, we could try to shell out a few bucks.\n\nIf anyone's curious, the game is a hack n' slash combat style game, featuring a few key abilities that allow you to fight enemies. It would be similar to BOTW or Genshin in this aspect, but much more linear in exploration style (you'd follow a predefined path and have pre-set encounters). It's primarily story based, featuring a choice-based system similar to that of Undertale, in the aspect you can kind of choose who your character becomes. The style is a bit more cartoony, goofy and light at times, but can also get more serious at some points. We're still in the early development stage, and don't have too much to show of it other than rough sketches and simple, experimental level design (sadly, with no characters!). But, we're fully committed to this game, and see development lasting around another year or two.\n\nIf anyone sees this and would like to join, please leave a comment, or feel free to email us at [pixelwhaleco@gmail.com](mailto:pixelwhaleco@gmail.com)! Otherwise, if anyone knows where to look for any student 3d modelers who'd be willing to join us, or maybe a different online Full Sail community we could look for interested people, or even just like a corkboard or something on campus we could slap some posters on or something, we'd love to hear about that too! Thanks so much!",

You pay for the launchbox, the student discount is just passed down from university to student, with the uni being the middle-man. If you want ProTools, you'll have to pay for it. There might be student discounts you can apply for through the Apple store though.",

For online students, a student ID card can be purchased and this can unlock some vendor- and reseller-specific discounts.   \n\n\nI'm in my 8th DCBS month and since starting, I have received the following:\n\n* Apple iPAD 9th Gen WiFi 64GB\n* Apple 16\" MacBook Pro (M1) with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD\n* Subscriptions to Adobe Creative Cloud and Chop Shop FX 2020 (valid while during program)\n* Final Draft 12 license\n* Movie Magic Budgeting  license\n* Movie Magic Scheduling license\n* There are also other sound effect and music resources available via the library that you must request and will have access to while in the program. \n\nGranted the camera package will be forthcoming sometime in the future. Good luck.",

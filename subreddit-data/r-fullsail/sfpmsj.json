One of my class finals was \u201c ok now go apply for jobs.\u201d And I thought that was really dope cuz like\u2026 yea why shouldn\u2019t I? I just spent a month learning all this new information ya know. And it\u2019s different to have a school that really pushes just simple getting into your field! Only 4 months in so maybe I\u2019ll have an update for u by the end of the academic year. Your first year you\u2019re not doing too many things in your field of study. Just the basics. Like any other college I suppose.",

You do understand the 2 main benefits of a creative writing degree for a writer.\n\nNo offense to your friend but if she's a novel mill, having written that many, I wouldn't jump on her advice. Neither Agatha Christie nor Stephen King even have 100. 150+ is getting into Danielle Steel (179 novels) territory, which...I'm not disparaging her but take that for what it's worth.",

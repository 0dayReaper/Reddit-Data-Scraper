    "postText": "I'm taking up Emerging Technology &amp; System Engineering (incredibly long name)  later this year and as I'm looking around from website to website I notice that it's very slim to none that anyone else is taking up this program. Full Sail also recently called me and said that the program has now changed names (now Cloud Technology) and things have been added/taken away. Does anyone know why this took place, why this major isn't popular, and why it's not talked about much? I was completely ecstatic about this school and even more about the major when I was explained what and how it is. I don't want go in thinking one thing then experiencing something completely different. I'm transfer from one university to this one so I want to make sure I'm making the right choice.",

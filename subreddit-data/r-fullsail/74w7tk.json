    "postText": "Hey so, I'm looking for advice. I dipped below a 2.0 and got slapped with probation that I got an extension for, and they took away my financial aid. I submitted an appeal and they denied it immediately and it's been days since I asked if they could tell me why. \n\nReason I dropped so low was because of attendance as my motorcycle got stolen twice and I guess that doesn't count as a legit issue even though I've provide police reports as proof. I live an hour away from school with no bus routes that would take me there so I literally had to use lyft for months. I couldn't even go for two months because I didn't have money for lyfts. I'm just wondering what else can be done besides withdrawing.\n\nI really really don't want to because I've got  a few more classes left in my program but my advisor is deflecting all of my questions and being really unhelpful and no one else is answering my emails.\n\nI'm really desperate because I'm all on my own and literally no one wants to help me at the school.\n\nDoes anyone here have advice? I'm kinda hanging on by a thread.",

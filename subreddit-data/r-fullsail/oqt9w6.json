Granted, you're gonna have to do a lot of crawling before they let you run-- Lots of Autodesk Maya work, etc for the first year. Character rigging is when Houdini is introduced, and I believe the later classes will introduce the VFX side of Houdini (if that is the \"focus\" path you choose when it comes time to do so.).",

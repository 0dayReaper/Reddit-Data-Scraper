Call the school and talk to someome about what you want to do and, if you can, take a tour and you can get a feel for it.\n\nBIGGEST THING ABOUT FULL SAIL\n\nYou get what you put in so if you arent willing to put in you wont get much out of it!",

            "comment": "Hey, not sure if you're still looking into this, but as someone who is currently approaching the halfway point of my music production (MP) degree, I thought I could be some help.\n\nI started off in pretty much the exact same situation as you; a passion for music, but no idea on the theory or technical side of things. I was basically starting from 0. The first 4 classes will be all core classes, things like Psychology, English, Creative Speaking, etc. Month 5 is when you start to learn the basics of recording. I'm talking bare bones stuff: where the volume on a mixing board is, proper cable connections, how to use Logic Pro X, how to connect and use microphones or instruments, things of that nature. I welcomed this because, again, I was basically clueless here. The other students who had this experience under their belt found it boring, and for obvious reasons.\n\nIn the last few months the classes have shifted to actually creating some music. It starts off with learning how to use plugins and software instruments, and next thing you know you'll be working on your first track. Then you start to delve more into theory (side note: MP is very theory heavy. You'll be working a ton with staff lines, the circle of fifths, major and minor keys, different modes, ear training, etc. If this is something you think will bore you out of your mind, I'd suggest looking into the recording arts degree).\n\nThere's no on-campus housing, so if you plan on coming down to Winter Park, I'd suggest budgeting for apartment living. That will include rent, groceries, furnishing, laundry, etc. The school offers a housing guide and a roommate list.\n\nThe accelerated nature of the course means that missing one or two days of class could mean retaking the whole course. The attendance policy is strict, and if you can't get those absences excused, you could be out a few grand. Unless your family lives in Florida, you probably won't see them much. There's no long summer break like other colleges have; there's only week-long breaks here and there (two for winter) and a couple of days off for national holidays.\n\nYou have to stay on top of your studies while you're down here. Don't miss assignment deadlines, as most of the work is weighted and usually contain things you'll need to know for the exams/projects. This isn't the type of school where you can miss 90% of the course and show up for the final exam and have an A. Constantly apply yourself and take the extra step to practice outside of assignments, especially since you're already at a disadvantage to those who have had experience.\n\nOne of the greatest things that has helped me while being down here is collaborating on tracks with my classmates and friends. It makes you practice everything you've been doing in school while flexing your creative muscles, and honestly it's always a fun night. Plus, you get to bounce ideas off of each other and learn from students in different degree programs.\n\nI know this get's repeated a lot, but you will get out of this school what you put into it. If you strive to be the top of your class and take the practice seriously, you'll be in a good spot as your make your way through the program. Get involved in some clubs or events that the school has, it's a great way to network and meet people you otherwise wouldn't have. \n\nWould I recommend this school to just anyone? Hell no. You have to have the drive and commitment. There are gonna be days where you want to slack off and just skip class because that hangover won't go away or whatever reason. I've made that mistake myself. But you really can't afford to (and I mean that literally; the school's price tag is no joke. MP costs $78,000 for the degree with an extra $4,000 for the LaunchBox. If you need to, look for scholarships, even the ones the school offers are pretty solid.) Remember, the school can introduce you to tons of people in the industry, but the market is over saturated. You need to stand out, and whether that's through good grades, a great portfolio, or being involved on the campus, just make sure you do. \n\nObviously I can't speak to getting a job in the industry afterwords, but I have many friends who are studying while working in industry related jobs, whether on or off campus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any questions feel free to ask away!",

            "comment": "I just was asking these questions not too long ago. A common theme seems to be you get back what you put in and if you are taking out loans for the school then it may not be in your best interest. I plan on attending in the near future but do not have to worry about the tuition costs. Consider online vs campus as well, cost of living will def have an impact depending on your income.",

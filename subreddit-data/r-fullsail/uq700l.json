    "postText": "I\u2019ve recently been looking into joining full sail university for sportscasting online and was excited especially since they said I have kind of a clean slate since my grades weren\u2019t that great in high school. But I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of mixed reviews on how it\u2019s a waste of money and it wouldn\u2019t get that respected then I\u2019ve seen reviews on how it\u2019s a really good school etc. i was just hoping if some of you guys could give me your thoughts on it because I was really excited now I have mixed emotions.",

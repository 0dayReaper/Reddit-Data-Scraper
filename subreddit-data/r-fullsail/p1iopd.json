    "postText": "Hello everyone,  \n\n\nI want to eventually work in the game industry as a game developer/programmer. I already have a bachelor's in computer science and most everyone online suggests just finding online resources and building up a portfolio. Having something more structured like FS would be beneficial for me to get a portfolio completed. I should be able to get a good chunk of tuition taken care of by the momentum scholarship since I did not use federal aid on my first degree. Am I crazy to even think of trying to attend FS? I would not fall into the \"trap\" I have seen about FS credits not transferring since I already have my degree or is this just wasted money and I should just be more dedicated to learning things on my own?  \n\n\nThanks!",

The staff are great and extremely helpful. I learned alot from them but I also learned alot from brackeys and DevSquad when it came to unity and Unreal. All in all I believe that FullSail is worth it if you stick to the full program and don't leave 2 months before graduation like I saw alot of people do",

            "comment": "As someone about a year into the program. Don\u2019t think it would be worth it for you. The first year is really easy if you have any programming knowledge. You don\u2019t start getting really anything game related until the last months of the program. And even then you don\u2019t really interact with the engine. If you know how how program already, make basic games and tools so as a junior dev you can hop right in and make a contribution to the team.",

So yes the second half is more specialized but really the only last 6 months( if you are looking at 20 month) I would recommend actually vis and sim To you but that is campus only.",

Ultimately though your portfolio is what matters. I would look into this video series for Unreal, it was funded with an Epic Games Mega grant, and if you create an Epic account you can take the course for free now. You\u2019ll learn C++ while making 3 different games. You\u2019ll get an idea of your skills and if you like the work. If you struggle with it, than FS is probably worth it, if not than you maybe ok on your own. \n\nThe biggest advantage with FS is the career center, but getting a programming job is much easier than the other majors. Studios usually need more of them, and there\u2019s never a shortage of new jobs. \n\nhttps://www.gamedev.tv/p/learn-unreal-engine-c-developer-4-22-for-video-game-development",

                    "comment": "The primary reason why I would pick FS is for getting projects/games to start a portfolio and to establish some networking with other like-minded people. The issue with something like what you linked to is motivation to actually complete it. I know that sounds bad and that I lack commitment, but I always do better with an environment that has consequences and deadlines. I could try and set my own deadlines but they would have no real weight to them if I don't complete them.  \n\n\nAs far as programming, I would say I am a decent programmer. I have worked in test automation for 5 years (primarily C#) and one development role for 6 months (Java SpringBoot which is not much help). I would be going down the development track, NOT the design track.  \n\n\nThe course that you posted is also on Udemy and from what I gather from the reviews, it is more like a follow along and you get 3-4 games completed. The reviews specifically state that you are told what to code, but not the why or logic behind doing it the way they say. It is not worth putting something on a portfolio and then someone asks you why you did x, y, or z in the code and you can't explain why other than you followed a course online. That is a big concern of mine. I want to know the logic and why behind what is implemented. I am not saying that FS is 100% the best option necessarily. I am just trying to get all the pros and cons so that I can make a better decision for myself.",

If you can afford to take on another $55,000 to pay for the program, then sure you will probably learn some new things. \n\nHowever, since you already have a CS degree, it would probably be better to just download Unreal or Unity and start playing. Find a YouTube or tutorial series you like, learn the basics of your engine of choice, and start making games. Start small, get a ball to move around a screen. Make it jump, add some obstacles, create a score system, add power-ups, make a save system, create new levels. Boom, game made. Add it to your portfolio. Make another one.",

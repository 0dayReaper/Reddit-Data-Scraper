    "postText": "So, for proper context, I've been an animation student for the past few years and transferred over here, internal issues. Liking FS so far. I've also been doing \"self-taught\" artwork in various media since I was about 9 yo.\n\nA common misconception I see with my peers is that they, *just have to do coursework to be industry ready here.* To be frank, this is a school (esp if you're an online student) that you already need to have experience for. I feel like a lot of the gripes people have, are because they were not fully prepared for everything their industry entails. An expedited online program is very difficult to become comfortable with, even for me, someone who had a traditional campus living experience before. So I can only imagine the person who's just starting back school after 10 years. Luckily, I was \"trained\" pretty well at my old school, so I know the most important work, is the work you do on your own.\n\nYour homework, school projects, etc, are not there to carry you. They're there to teach you how to apply concepts; Such so that you can carry *yourself*. And the content is so fast, I literally would not be able to grasp the work unless I had prior experience. But that's just me. And a lot of you are probably smarter than me, but it takes me longer periods of time to fully understand concepts.\n\nSo if you've never done anything in your industry before, in an amateur fashion(enough to have a solid foundation) do not go to Fullsail to learn as a beginner. Especially as an online student. They tell you you dont need to know anything, and while technically true, it is factually wrong. There is a LOT you need to know, and a LOT more you will learn.\n\nCourses I would recommend taking for a lower rate, at a community college, (or even free courses online) for very beginner animation students are:\n\nArt Foundations (Drawing 101/102 in some codes, also a lot of free resources online) *Non-Negotiable*\n\n3d modeling 1:(I recommend Maya, as for me it was the most difficult to grasp, and what I started with, but I had a full 2 years of practice to get the basics down, and once you learn Maya, concepts translate into other programs like Blender, and Zbrush pretty well.) *Non-Negotiable*\n\nNote: The issue with this is you may not be able to get a Maya license(I have a student one) So blender is a good alternative.\n\nA basic photoshop course, to learn some foundational photo editing and retouching skills.\n\nA basic design course, like typography. (Anything that will show you how to use InDesign and Adobe illustrator in conjunction)\n\nA basic computer animation course, (Id recommend learning ToonBoom and After Effects in conjunction)\n\nFigure Drawing. *Non-Negotiable*\n\nDigital Painting. *Non-Negotiable*\n\nThere are more I can list, but I'd rather it not be an essay.\n\nNow I know that seems like an overwhelming amount to know, before starting your first day of class, but keep in mind, you only need to have the *basics*. I am absolutely no expert, but I have a solid foundation in all of these topics and more. Does it mean Im very good at ALL of these things? **Absolutely not**, *but can I communicate ideas and concepts of all of these topics, to a specialist who is far better than me at these things?* **Absolutely**.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's about communication and collaboration. You cannot communicate a concept simply and effectively, that you do not understand foundationally.\n\nSo, do consider another school first, or other learning first, before coming to Fullsail. Or Any Art/Design focused for-profit educational institution in general. Lest you have a bad time and waste your time. Last, of all, cuz im doing this rather than my discussion post right now.\n\nRemember the Five P's,\n\nProper Planning Prevents Poor Performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: For clarity, Most of the resources I've listed, ***are free***, and you can teach yourself from professional tutorials online.

School gives you a foundational understanding and the mental tools to expand that understanding.\n\nThat doesn't mean certain omissions are acceptable or that school should not make an effort to ensure you're prepared to enter the industry of choice. But school (any school) is not going to help you assemble the entire puzzle. They're going to teach you how to identify all the characteristics of the pieces, get you started assembling one corner, and let you finish the rest of your own gumption.",

I\u2019m in the graphic design program ( online) and I\u2019m learning a shit ton.  My hand drawings and sketches aren\u2019t as good as some of the classmates but I feel like with practice I\u2019ll get there.  \nMy experience so far has been pretty good as far as knowledge, currently in GR2 and some of it is learning on the fly but it\u2019s getting there.",

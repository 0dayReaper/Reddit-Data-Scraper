    "postText": "I\u2019m looking to speak to some game design people and talk to them about getting into the program and if they think the bachelors is worth it. Possibly just the associates. I hear that people with the certificate have some success in getting into the field. \n\nI\u2019m just trying to find out if I will have a better chance the further educated I become? I\u2019m not banking on finding a job in the field ASAP. But I would like to know what\u2019s the chances I have to get a job are with just a certificate or associates compared to a bachelor\u2019s.",

Not trying to kill your dreams but you need to consider the financial cost. It's expensive without scholarships. I know a few people still paying their loans, I went in 2010. It's a huge burden on them.",

After I spoke well with the admissions rep he even waived the entrance fee for me, which was very nice of him, and now I near my graduation date.\n\nLiterally the only way to not get accepted is to be a convicted felon.\n\nThis does not mean that you shouldn't spend time doing your research and due diligence on weather or not Full Sail is the school for you. There are a LOT of people that come here for an easy degree, only to drop out 6 months in because it gets difficult, especially in the computer science degrees.\n\nIn terms of cost scholarships are great and federal grants can help a ton. I am in the Simulation and visualization degree which nets at about 95k when I started, I am going to be graduating with around 30k (hopefully less due to the federal rebate happening right now) thanks very much to my parents and full sails scholarships. It's not cheap, but I'll be damned if I haven't had a blast learning through this school, and thanks to the high intensity learning cycles I genuinely feel like I am ready for the job world.\n\nDO YOUR RESEARCH THO! If you don't intend to enter the field that you study then full Sail might be a waste of time, energy and money for you. Don't come here with the  intent of not working either, as some classes will keep you busier than a full time job.",

            "comment": "The internet says that they have a 100% approval rating. It's not a competitive school in that way. \n\nThe school also has a high dropout rate. Why? A lot of the people are coming in fresh out of high school and underestimate the amount of work. It starts slow at first, the first 4 classes are extremely easy. \n\nImo none of the classes have been hard, but I have a degree already. Hard depends on you and is quite subjective. Eventually the classes shift to two classes per month, which does take a lot of time. If you think of a traditional Bachelor's Degree, a class might last about 3 months. Full Sail is an expedited learning process, but you still have rhe same amount of hours. So that class that took 3 months at a normal school is crammed into your head in one month. I think this is a large portion of why people dropout of the school, they just aren't prepared for that level of work. \n\nKeep in mind most of these classes are art focused. My first degree was in Cybersecurity. I don't think that a degree like that would work very well in a trachibg method like Full Sail, mainly because of the really difficult stuff. I'm four credits away from being a math major, and not by choice, that's just how any math classes I needed. I couldn't imagine thing some of the very high level math classes like that in only a month, let alone having to do one of those classes and another high level class. I just don't think it would be very feasible. \n\nA lot of people mention cost, and for good reason. Full Sail is not cheap. Now, its not that expensive if ypu compare it to most other state colleges ether. My state college here in Oregon is roughly 17k to 20k a year. If you include living costs it's a lot more theb that and will easily equal over 30k a year. But without owing costs included, 20k a year is 80k after 4 years. From what I've seen most of the Bachelor programs at Full Sail are between 50k and 80k, so rhe price is comparatively similar. For most people, they qualify to not pay out of pocket. A basic breakdown is below. \n\nPale Grant - 6k\nGOV loans - 11k\n\nTotal - 17k \n\nTuition cost according to collegedimply.com - about 23k. Including books if needed. \n\nDifference needed - 5k\n\nFull Sail Scholarship - 20k or something like that\n\nFull Sail offers a Scholarship. Most qualify for it. I think it's around 15k to 20k. This helps to offset paying abythjng out of pocket. You do not get snythjng left over from it. So it's quite affordable. \n\nI like the experience so far and find it enjoyable.",

That will knock out a few months.\nJust my two cents",

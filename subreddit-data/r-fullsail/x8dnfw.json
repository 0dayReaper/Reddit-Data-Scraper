Regarding the skill level of drawing/art you need to somewhat have an okay time throughout the course. I'm a full-time tattoo artist and do draw in my free time. So I was wondering if anyone was in it, can tell me roughly how difficult Game Art is?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I know Game Art uses a lot of Maya &amp; Zbrush (Not sure about Zbrush too much) but yeah.",

The program is great, but you only get out of it what you put into it, so you\u2019ll need to do the work. You\u2019re going to spend a ton of time in Maya, some in Unreal and Substance, and a bit in zBrush. If you want to focus on Characters more you\u2019ll spend more time in zBrush. Maya isn\u2019t too bad to pick up so I wouldn\u2019t worry, but I\u2019d watch a few videos from Shane Olson for zBrush before you get there. Also, don\u2019t do your UV mapping in Maya, you definitely want to look into 3DCoat. It\u2019s another application you have to learn, and I\u2019m not sure FS offers it, but the amount of time you\u2019ll save using it will more then make up for it.",

I\u2019d definitely check out videos with someone who blocks in their characters with primitives, instead of just starting with a sphere and continuously dragging parts out and Dynameshing. That\u2019s much harder to keep clean since your poly count skyrockets quickly.\n\nMaya is amazing, but it\u2019s UV tools are just standard and average. 3DCoat is so popular mainly because of it\u2019s UV tools and algorithms. Most pros who use it only do for the UVs.",

We only just started using Zbrush a month or two ago. \n\nI have not heard anything about 3DCoat though. I will look into it, because UVs suck, but I haven't had quite the same amount of trouble as I did originally but that's because my computer/mouse/something was being a dick and would not let me select specific edges while in the UV window.\n\nI left a huge reply on someone else's post about my experience, honestly I don't know how much of it was legible though cause I was dead tired, and I have just woken up from a nap. Overall, the experience has been good for online. You have to be prepared for that workload and have some serious time management and discipline skills. If you want to put your best effort in, you won't have a lot of time for much else. I had a schedule that only had me working on the weekends, and I spent the rest of the week putting 8-10 hours a day at my desk and still racing the clocks on deadlines.",

I would much rather do this then sit in front of a debugger screen for 10 hours. Is it hard? Depends on you. \n\nMaya, Zbrush, the Substance suite, Unreal Engine 4, though hopefully some 5, are all common tools to learn to use. Learn Blender, a LOT if it carries over to Maya, but before all tha, learning yo draw well will take you far. Then Blender while watching watching videos on Zbrush. Zbrush is the most difficult out of all the software, and it's mainly because of the layout of the software. \n\nTake a few courses in Zbrush, practice what you learn. Then take a few courses in the pipeline development, following along how assets are made from start to finish. Going from Zbrush into Topogun, then back into Zbrush, then Substance Painter, etc. Learn snd experiment. The more you learn on your own the easier the classes will be for you, and the more youl get out of your courses. \n\nLook into Topogun 3. Topogun 2 already exists, 3 comes out this year, and the beta is available already. It allows for rapid retopology, far faster then anythjng else currently available. Though not taught in class, retopology is part of the process. Doing it in Zbrush is painful, and just shouldn't be done. It can be done in Maya, but Topogun is just better. Use each tool for the purpose ypu have for it, a lot of people want one tool to rule them all. \n\nMost of the tools we have do one thing really well, and that's perfectly fine.",

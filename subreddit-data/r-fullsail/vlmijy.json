    "postText": "Hey all! I'll be starting the Music Business online bachelors degree in September. Scrolling through the reddit for Full Sail I haven't noticed anyone else in that program. \n\nJust looking for others who are currently taking it or have taken it to get some insight on what to expect. How did you like your professors? Are there any books or podcasts you've found helpful?\n\nIf you've completed that program, where are you now in your career? Was the degree helpful in pursuing the music business?",

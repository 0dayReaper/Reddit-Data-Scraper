            "comment": "Yup,you can keep them on the back burner as a reserve emergency option. If you have other schools in mind for online audio production, go for them, however if you are freshly starting audio production as a field I would highly recommend just taking some generic classes at your nearest community College like math, science, English, history, etc, and dedicating all your off time or \"school hours\" (9-5 on weekdays) to doing audio production. \n\nThis way you can keep yourself in the rhythm of going to school, your parents would probably be happy that you are \n\nA) still going to school and not taking a gap year, all while saving a ton of money you would have been paying for the same crap otherwise (remember most college credits are universal, you can apply them to many schools) \n\nB) you'll see if audio production is the field for you, as you can spend the days you don't have the few classes you might learning it on your own and trying to produce the best music you can, YouTube being a great guide. If you like the field, jump into it if you wanna go through college, however this let's you try it without committing a couple years of your life and a couple dozen thousand dollars on it.\n\nIf you get a full ride to any school, that should be taken though, absolutely no reason to let that kind of opportunity go to waste\n\nBest of luck",

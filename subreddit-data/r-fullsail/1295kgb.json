If anyone is able to help or lole...kinda guide me in certain areas I'd really appreciate it \ud83e\udd79",

Maya, Zbrush, and all the software are giant beasts made for people working in multiple disciplines. The menus are confusing and inconsistent; even if you do everything right, there is a high chance of bugginess. It's part of the process, and much of it comes down to practice. It took me *forever* to learn a lot of the Maya keyboard shortcuts and things, but after a while became second nature. Don't let that discourage you. RenderMan, by itself, is a huge and complicated beast, for sure.\n\nAre you having trouble with a particular feature in Zbrush, the software in general, or the transition from poly modeling to the clay molding workflow? Also, to confirm, your launch box should have come with a tablet. If you're not using it already, it is practically necessary for Zbrush.",

Runs well and it 's good to have access to all the needed programs.\n\nI've heard of a few issues with the zbook itself but you get tech support and a warranty - all issues I've heard of were resolved.",

It really is more of a personal preference thing. For example final cut pro x is a mac only software, (I know that isn't one you will work with its just an example). For game design, Microsoft office will only be for the mac. If I am not mistaken you will not be able to run it on windows. Which is kind of funny to me. ",

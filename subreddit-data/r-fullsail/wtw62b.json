            "comment": "The Orlando housing market is one of the most expensive in the country right now compared to wages. It is incredibly difficult to find any affordable housing. Your best bet would be to work with Full Sail's housing department to try and find a roommate. The odds of finding anything under even $1500/mo are slim.\n\nThe absolute cheapest place in the area for a while has been [Azure](https://www.mckinley.com/apartments/florida/winter-park/azure-winter-park). They have a 532 sqft Studio that used to sit comfortably under $1000. Now it's going for \\~$1300.",

            "comment": "Buy a van or small motor home, maybe even a small bus. Invest about 2k into building it out and you have a house on wheels. If it's just you, it won't be difficult. I built a bus out (40 feet), that sleeps my whole family (of 4, 2 adults 2 kids, third on the way, a dog, a cat, and a handful of birds). \n\nI built the entire bus out for 10k, and that includes the cost of the bus. Most areas of the US have very expensive rent. I used  to live in Florida, and the average pay in Florida us extremely low compared to rent costs. So eliminate the cost of rent. A van is plenty large for one person, or if you need more space, a small motor home or bus. \n\nMy house costs 1500 a month. That's normal in my area, in Oregon, but it definitely gets much higher. We travel a lot, and rent the house out to students for 600 a room. It helps the students out, pays the house (bank), and we can travel. We dontcmake anything off of it, it basically covers the mortgage and bills. \n\nTo answer your question, the only way you'll find something for this price is if you find a room for rent.",

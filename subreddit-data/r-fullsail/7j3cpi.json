I'm married and just turned 28 so I know I'm a little late on starting but there might be someone that had the same situation.",

                            "comment": "It wasn't too hard to find work, no. Many from my class got a job making games. I'd say about 25% maybe. I estimate another 25% found jobs in which they are still writing code, but not in the games industry. The remainder either dropped out early or did not find a coding job. I found a job after a friend of mine had landed a job. He told his boss about me and his boss brought me on as well as a result of the good word put in for me. If you want to find a job, I'm confident that you can. The first big thing is, can you handle the program. It is difficult. After the halfway point, the difficulty of classes, at least for me, jumped up significantly. Many of my friends dropped out around that point. Also, to be truly successful at the course, you need to devote a even more of your time outside of the 8 hrs a day for classes to code and learn on your own. My classmates who managed to put in that extra effort got the big jobs like at Id software and Lucasarts. If you can make it through the program, but just can't put in 12-16 hr days or maybe you are and it just doesn't come as naturally to you, then I would suggest network heavily. Make friends with your class, and use the school career development resources. If you try I'm sure you could land a job. In summary, its all about how much effort you put in. The tricky part is, its about 3-4 times as much effort than you are probably imagining right now. ",

The answer from /u/idzohar is correct though.\n\nThe program changed but it still is pretty hard. You need to learn to code on your own or you will fall behind after the first 8 months.",

We don't study data structures and how to write good code but we need to do it anyways.\n\nDesign does sound a lot more artsy than development but in reality we spend more time understanding what makes games fun and then testing those out with non optimal code.

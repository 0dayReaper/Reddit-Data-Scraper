What kind of music do you make/listen to if they\u2019re separate genres. Also, are you on campus or online?",

Favorite genre is hard to pinpoint because I listen to so much variety. My top genres would have to be deep dub (EDM subgenre if not familiar), indie/alt, and rap. Last song I listened to is Romeo &amp; Juliet by Hobo Johnson and The Lovemakers.",

I think I'm gonna start listening to hobo johnson more often. I like his flow. another good song of the same name is by peter mcpolland. But listen to the acoustic version (just my personal opinion).",

Some of my favorites are Ternion Sound, Angelic Root, The Widdler, and Salty. There is so much variety when it comes to EDM. The deep dub subgenre is my favorite, but there's also dubstep, riddim, house, bass house, trance, and so much more. It's very widespread and easy to find something you like. If you enjoy weird sounds, bass lines, and steady drum beats, you'll find something you vibe with!",

I'm looking at getting into Full Sail for a music program, but I was curious what drove all you to study here. I read reviews and Full Sail seems like they have a really bad rep. Things like being regionally unaccredited, cost vs reward, for-profit ruining experiences, not valuable after graduation (people/companies won't see great value in a Full Sail bachelors), etc. The list goes on and on, but people are basically saying the high cost is not worth the education. I genuinely want to attend Full Sail but reading reviews about it gives me doubt. Did you have the same doubt as me before you applied or started attending FS? I wanted to get input from current Full Sail students and what made all you want to study at Full Sail considering the price and what people say about their experience. I appreciate every response!",

Do you, as someone who has taken the course, feel as though it was worth it? Are the projects and coursework fun, or are they boged down but mindless details?\n\nAny feedback would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

The teachers have been great so far, trying to get in touch with your advisor can be difficult, because they're always changing. To be honest at times I feel more prepared to be a producer than cinematographer. I thought the lighting classes would have been more in depth, most of what I learned I already knew coming from a photography background. If  its worth it? not sure I can answer yet but you learn all aspects from editing, producing, lighting, directing, producing, and script writing. If you h3any questions feel free to dm me.",

I feel are far too high, but pay attention to what he says and practice even though the school doesn\u2019t give you much time to actually do that.",

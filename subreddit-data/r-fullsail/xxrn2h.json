Understand how to ask questions and do professional college level work, and more than the bare minimum it's not so bad.    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is A LOT of people who I don't even know what universe they come from, we learned APA, MLA, basic writing in high-school.   Yet there are people both fresh out of highschool and middle aged professionals that turn in absolute trash material for assignments.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Examples:\n\nProfessor:  Do not cite Wikipedia as a source\n\nStudent Z:  \"According to Wikipedia...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProfessor: Use APA Formatting and in text citations.\n\nStudent Y:   \n\n\\&gt; Paper is written without any sources or citations, it's all personal anecdotes about something that needs to be actually researched, looks like it was copypasta'd from a twitter hot take, the required material in the paper is not even present, topic is way off on a tangent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProfessor: &gt; Mentions something 9 different times, in multiple places, consistently about X thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStudent X:  &gt; Where can I find out about X thing, and what was it about?  I'm so confused?!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Just saying you want to be (Insert game designer for a AAA company, a famous music artist, or film director etc) and hoping your classmates \"Achieve their goals!\"  is not enough and does not cut it.**    \n\n\\_\\_\n\nMaybe it's because I've been to college before, and have had a decade in professional work settings, but I'm just surprised the amount of people showing up having nothing prepared what so ever.",

But a LOT of people have trouble with it) The main thing to realize before taking these classes is, there is no break. It's one class a month until you graduate. No breaks in between. Sometimes life happens and it's hard to log in each and every day or to get assignments in on time. The instructions will listen and try ro help with not getting assignments in on time or with the assignment in general. Some classes use discord but not all of them. Even then, getting in touch with one is difficult due to scheduling. It's intense due to scheduling but so far not difficult.",

The class I am in now is really easy as long as you read the assignments properly and turn the material in on time. Overall it\u2019s been a solid two months so far. Two more months and I\u2019ll start using unity and unreal; that\u2019s when the real fun begins.",

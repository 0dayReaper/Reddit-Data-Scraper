SCAD, who rightfully didn't reply to my requests seems to be much more interested in those with creative minds and high potential.",

Because you had a bad high school record? I\u2019ve got nothing from this post whatsoever except a random rant on something nobody can help you with unless you go into detail.",

Your best bet is to sign up for some online courses (like Udemy, Lynda, etc...) or pick up some books on your own and give it a shot. And just like Full Sail you get out what you put into it. ",

What I said about them accepting me gives me the impression that they just want to get as much money as possible by letting in as many people as possible, including idiots like me. SCAD on the other hand seems to care more about education as they don't just let in as many people as possible",

Instead they focus on teaching you how to learn different tools quickly.  Like others said in this topic it's all about what you put into it, the more you try the better the results you will get.",

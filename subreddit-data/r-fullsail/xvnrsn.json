Thanks in advance!",

I believe they require you to use Maya for assignments, but Blender is a good alternative for personal use. As an alternative to an alternative, I would highly recommend swapping out the MacBook for something that runs windows for both software and performance reasons, if you\u2019re able to. If you want to look into that option, I\u2019d be happy to help you with it.",

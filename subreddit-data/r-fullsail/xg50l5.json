I'm also typing from memory so forgive me if I mess this up  \n1) Download the OneDrive App from the App Store.  \n2) Make sure you have logged into your school account on One Drive  \n3) Depending on what word processing software you're using, save it or share it. This should pull up options as to where.   \n4) Tap either \"add storage account\" and add One Drive or select the OneDrive App to share to.  \n5) In apps that don't have a direct save function, you can also move the location using Files by backing all the way out to see \"Locations\" and you should see OneDrive already there.  \nLet me know if that helps! If not, may be able to help troubleshoot more.",

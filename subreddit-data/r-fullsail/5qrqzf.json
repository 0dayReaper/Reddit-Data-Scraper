You get the Macbook with the R9 M370x as a dedicated GPU (which switches with Iris Pro when needed), 500GB of storage, and the 2.5GHz processor. \n\n\nSadly, I cannot say what tablet you get. I'm working on a degree that doesn't require it. But the Macbook is universal for almost all the degrees, as far as I know.",

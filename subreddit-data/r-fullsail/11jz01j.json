    "postText": "So I\u2019m going to full sail for computer animation doing online. I want to know if there is anyone else that went for computer animation ? Do they teach you everything you need to know about modeling, animating and texturing? Really eager to learn to model can\u2019t wait for the courses. But, I\u2019ve heard bad things about full sail. Everyone has their own experience so I won\u2019t let that get to me. By taking computer animation will I be able to model and texture whatever I want when I\u2019m done with the degree?",

            "comment": "I didn't do computer animation, but I did do graphic design online. I think I will be echoing many people who have gone through any of the online programs when I say, \"You get out of it what you put into it.\" They are going to show you the basics of everything, but if you actually want to have a good degree coming out, you will need to put in the extra effort, and be willing to do all the extra studying that you can get. If you are not a self-motivated person, this can be difficult (especially if you are going to be holding a full time Job wile doing the online school) \n\nIf you do the bare minimum, your degree will be worthless because in this industry, you need to build a portfolio for your potential jobs to look at. But, if you go the extra mile, you can build a portfolio that employers would like.\n\nIn person would be the best option, and would give you the best opportunity. But online can work if you are able to study on your own. \n\nThe first half of my degree, I questioned it, and felt like I wasn't learning anything, but I was also doing the bare minimum, I was mostly getting A's and B's but I wasn't actually taking the time to learn the subject.",

I hope to be able to model with great detail one day",

If your demo reel is ONLY class work. You\u2019re going to have a bad time. You need to be constantly practicing outside of class. Record yourself or friends performing actions, and rig and animate a model to match. Do this a ton until you have a deep understanding of real human motion. (Uncanny valley is a terrible thing)\n\nAlso, network heavily. You\u2019re going to have to hustle for your first job. Having people who can refer and navigate red tape is a very powerful tool.",

I did talk to a student liaison I believe it\u2019s called you could try that and ask his/her opinion on things or questions you may have. Other then that online they are really flexible.",

As the im still in the core classes everyone takes, to me they have been fairly easy. The meetings are recording so you don\u2019t have to attend them if you are not able to. Also another thing my meetings have been mainly on Tuesday but it is all up to the teacher.",

I was wondering what kind of time frame we have between the end of this class and the start of the next that we receive our launchboxes. Did you guys recieve it within the last week of your fourth class? I'm also trying to plan my move around it, so just trying to get an idea. Thanks!",

You get your launch box at orientation, if you are a campus student.  If you're online I'm not exactly sure what month you would get it in, but I think you get it between months 3-5.  I hope that helps. ",

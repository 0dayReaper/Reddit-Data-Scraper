    "postText": "I've been going to Full Sail for a few months now and when I received my Launch Box items back then I questioned the laptop and the Samsung Tab A that I received because on the website it clearly states that I should receive a Nvidia Shield K1 Tablet and the laptop that I had in my hands was a model newer(HP Zbook 17 G5 instead of G4). I asked Full Sail support if this was right and they said it was and that they would update the website to reflect those changes. Fast forward a few months and they still haven't updated the included tablet on the website but they did update the laptop to the G5 model. Just wondering if anyone in Game Dev or privy to this information can inform me if this is kosher or not.",

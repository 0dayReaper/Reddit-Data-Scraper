I\u2019ll be working a full-time job while attending college and wanted to know if anyone out there has taken a similar program online and could lend some advice on this topic.",

I was able to work a full-time job and deal with kids at home while still having time to get my assignments done.\n\nIgnore the negative comments here. If you make an effort and don\u2019t procrastinate then you\u2019ll be just fine. If you\u2019re the type of person that waits until the last minute to do assignments or turn things in then you may struggle.",

Yes, there was a week or two that I had things turned in early and it was no issue. But there were also weeks that I was pulling 12 hour shifts on my off days trying to get things done. I'm not saying you're wrong, your experience is an experience, I'm saying don't try to play your experience as the only one. There are many factors in peoples lives that affect things. Same for your situation. How do we know you didnt do the bare minimum on your assignments just to get an 100 and didnt actually challenge yourself or make an interesting project? How do we know you didn't understand things immediately with no issues? Just because you didn't have issues, doesn't mean everyone else is lazy. People struggle with things differently, and some subjects are tougher to learn for some people and take more time to fully grasp.",

That said, I still found plenty of time to do my assignments while working full-time and dealing with a complex home life with 4 kids.\n\nI invested a lot of time into building a portfolio and even streamed development while still getting my assignments done. Not at all saying I didn\u2019t have assignments which were turned in late or even not at all, but passing is passing. No one gives a damn about your grades or asks about what you did in school after you\u2019ve graduated. If your portfolio sucks then you\u2019re less likely to get hired even if you\u2019ve got a 4.0 GPA.",

So far it's been a great experience and I've learned a fair amount already. The teacher was nice and the class was fairly easy. As long as you follow directions and tame the time to use the tools the provide to you, you should be just fine.",

I gave them several weeks notice of an emergency trip I had to take, and their response was, \"Damn,... welp I hope they have internet because your assignment is due on the dates provided.\" Even holidays are like, \"Hey! Lucky you! You get the day off for Thanksgiving!\" And you think, \"oh that's cool, so my assignments aren't due on Sunday, but now it's due on Monday, then? Since I get a day off?\" And your teacher doesn't respond, but the date on your assignment says, \"yeah, naw. You'll be working through Thanksgiving on your \"day off\" if you want to get this assignment done...\"",

            "comment": "I'm a year in and the instructors don't give a single fuck about your work schedule. I feel like most of my time has been wasted on random meaningless assignments instead of focusing on teaching me anything tangible about game design. School workload is extremely inefficient. At times, you'll easily get your assignments done. Other weeks you'll wonder how they expect you to finish everything, like it's some sort of cruel joke. They'll use the excuse that it's supposed to stimulate real-life \"crunch\" in the game industry, but there is no actual real-life rational excuse for it. It's just instructor laziness or cruelty. Crunch is a disease in the game industry, so why are you emulating it!? I'll give them that the student website is very user-friendly. But it's almost like the tests are designed by the instructors with zero regulation. An entire test can be based on a video, and every question's answer is subjective to how the instructor perceived it, not on what the video actually says. And if an instructor messes up and subtracts points, you can point it out to them, but they won't fix it. Really, you're lucky if an instructor even responds to a message.  Also, 90% of the course material is free online, right now. There are a few lectures made by the instructors themselves. But the majority of videos you learn from are free and accessible on YouTube or the unreal engine site right now. Also, you better take a C++ class before hand,  because once you get into scripting, they treat you like you already know it. No introduction. You're just thrown in with little to no help and expected to complete assignments. They have a tudor program, but it's a joke. The times I sought help was just a round about of them talking to me like I'm an idiot and telling me to look up youtube videos. Be prepared to pay an insane amount of money to go to a school that forces you to teach yourself. I've learned more from googling and YouTubing things on my own to complete assignments than I have from the actual courses. Bottom line, going here is like going to a fancy haircut place that is popular and charges three times the amount of other haircutting place and coming out with just a regular cut. Don't expect to transfer either, most other colleges don't accept FullSails credits, so you'll have wasted so much money and time. I recommend finding a regionally accredited college.",

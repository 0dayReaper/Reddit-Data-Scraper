You will get a much more comprehensive and reputable education there.\n\nMI is a for-profit school just like Full Sail, so it's six one way, half dozen the other there.\n\nIf I were just out of high school and looking to go to college for the first time, I would definitely be looking to go to a traditional university, especially if I had the talent to get into someplace like Berklee. Full Sail is great for people in specific situations (like me, an old person who has a full time job and needs school to work around my other responsibilities), but there are better educations and connections to be made out there.",

If you're itchy to start learning sooner rather than later id probably suggest self directed study until you know for sure full sail is your best option. \n\nI am attending currently, read a lot about the online program beforehand so I'm not too surprised or upset by the curriculum. This is a decade after my first college attempt so I am personally aiming a bit lower to save my mental health lol.\n\nBut yeah if Berklee wants you, try it out. That's a good school. Full sail does have a good alumni network though, that's part of why I'm going here. So don't take me saying that as saying one is inherently better, I just think they make more sense for different people.",

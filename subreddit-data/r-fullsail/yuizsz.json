I'm looking into it and it seems perfect considering I plan to try to get an adjunct teaching position. \n\nAlso, does anyone know what happened to Full Sail's MFA in Creative Writing program? I asked someone from admissions and they were no help.",

[click ici](https://www.accsc.org/UploadedDocuments/2022/Public-Notice/Redacted-Letters/Full-Sail-University-055214-SAL-Warning-Letter.pdf)\n\nOne of the bigger issues was the below benchmark employment rates for the MFA creative writing program (with many others). \n\nWriting/literature are degrees that have low employment rates anyway, and it's kind of hard for a newer, for profit school to do much to change that unless they are offering jobs.",

            "comment": "I am currently enrolled in the Instructional Design and Technology Master's program. I previously attended Full Sail for the Computer Animation BS in 2008, and I've also audited a few classes. I also did some independent research into Instructional Design before I decided to enroll at Full Sail. If you haven't already, I recommend you check out r/instructionaldesign if you're interested since there's a LOT of great information there. The general consensus there is most Master's degrees available for instructional design is that find the one that makes the most sense to you and is the cheapest because they're all pretty much the same.\n\nAll that out of the way: The IDT Instruction Design Master's classes are some of the best I've ever taken, period, let alone at Full Sail. I'm about six months in, and every teacher I have had so far has had a doctorate in education and decades of experience teaching in various settings (K-12, Undergrad, Commercial and Government training, etc). As you can imagine, they're also some of the best organized since the instructors are highly experienced with teaching. The classes are challenging and fast-paced, as is typical at Full Sail, but I quickly learned an absolute ton. I've also had a great opportunity to talk to a lot of other industry professionals as guest lecturers which have been wonderful. It can be challenging at times to keep up with the pace, but even so, I've been able to maintain a consistent 4.0 even with my full-time job.\n\nAs always, make the choice is best for you and, if that is Full Sail, be ready to put the work in. I've had several other classmates in my courses that don't put in the same amount of effort and have not progressed with me which is disappointing, but it's a reality of the fast-paced environment. If you have any other questions about the program just let me know! I've inspected it up and down and by now I've interactive with nearly all of the instructors at least once.\n\nEdit: Grammarly extension really duplicated a lot of my comment...",

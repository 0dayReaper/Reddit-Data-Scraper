Is it really that bad? \n\nAlso, how much is tuition? An admission counselor said you pay a portion of it for each academic year (8 months) but how much do you pay? I know the degree program is 89,500 dollars (Computer Animation)",

Took me an year to get into the industry mainly due to connections. The student loan debt is very scary and trust me there plenty of competition. Nobody wants to hirer and know it all graduate. We want hard working people who are good and what they do. I don\u2019t know if you learned in high school or YouTube or fullsail. If your hood your good. If you have an good work ethic and know how to manage time your golden. There\u2019s so many try hards who kiss ass yet stink in teams due to their huge ego. I\u2019ve seen people who self tailgater them selves in third world countries completely outclass some fullsail grads simply due to their talent and personal drive to be the best",

You get an immense amount of resources from them from job engines you never heard of to conferences and connections that can change your life. If you want a job just go to trade school and go be a plumber but if you want to grow, learn from people who have been in the field for 25+ years and connect and have a life long career doing what you love then it\u2019s the move. You get everything you need from them to do what you want in the field you love, it\u2019s up to you though what you do with these resources and information that is given to you. If money is something you\u2019re worried about then you should go into finances and business , when you get good enough at what you love the money will follow. Focus on what matters first",

You can learn the rest in your own. But it takes unreal discipline that I\u2019m not sure you can do on your own. Kinda like being I the military. They mold you into an hard working machine. I\u2019ve seen people who were in the right place at the right time make it huge then I\u2019ve seen people blow their credit score and wast it getting nowhere.  Some of the teachers are truly amazing. You have to make it your own. Trust me nobody cares about your degree. My art director told me when I was young. Why do you tell me that you have an bachelors I thought you were married. He didn\u2019t give an shit about my Fullsail degree he cared because I was good enough to be hired. Work your ass off or goto to an party school and do t wast peoples times. Trust me your credit score will thank you",

My original group im still friends with today and pick up right were left off no matter how long ago it was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore focused on the actual school, what a lot of people dont realize is that its what you make of it. I did the Live and touring degree and I know from stories and seeing people leave that when they get that piece of paper they think of it as a jump forward when in reality you need to put in the work as well. I never had a teacher BS me, or at least didn't let them, I sought the information I needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nin the end go for the knowledge and connections, youre not going to necessarily make the connections that will land you that dream job but they give you insight and skills you previously didn't have. I loved the school and I recommend it if you can afford it. Its all about paths. There is no one way to do something, Full Sail is one way and other schools or trainings are another. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCant stress this enough, go to Full Sail thinking this will give me the tools to make my career not this will give me a career.",

As far as cost, keep in mind that tuition is only a portion of what you\u2019re paying for. You also have living expenses which is a huge cost. Expect to be paying anywhere from $1,000-2,000 a month depending on how your lifestyle - roommates or no roommates, how much you\u2019re willing to spend on food, transportation method, do you have pets that will be coming with you, do you have to pay for medicine, etc. it does add up a lot. I ended up not finishing my degree there (not bc the program was bad), however, my friends who did are all paying about $600 a month in student loans which can be quite difficult to afford right out of college.",

The best advice I can give someone worrying about if this is a good or bad school; just remember that bad doctors also graduate from Harvard.

It\u2019s not a traditional school (also graduated from a CC). You are not entering an industry that you just walk into and start working. You are attempting to work in one of the hardest, most ruthless work sectors: the entertainment industry.",

Put it to you this way like in the game industry you have crunch time 70-100 hour weeks. Fullsail wants around 50 but that\u2019s an lie. Basically it\u2019s crunch time very month. Unless if they made the ca programs easier hold on tight it\u2019s an insane ride. Hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done crazy considering I worked in the gaming industry",

            "comment": "I would not even attempt to take on this level of debt without seriously looking into other schools first. I would seriously consider state schools in this case. Not sure what state you live in, but there are some excellent state schools that would provide a solid 4 years without the stress of cramming it into a short timeline, and you could work another job as well. Full Sail crams a lot of stuff in a very short timeline. Honestly, why? To get you out in the industry faster? When it's all said and done...IT'S A JOB! You will get burned out, you will be in your mid 40s someday craving to spend more time with your children, family and mowing the lawn on the weekends...not your J.O.B. Why rush four years into one just for the stress of that debt hanging over your head for many, many years!\n\nI went to full sail in the 90s. I did well, I made connections, but realized the pay in my industry was crap (I was in Film program), and there were very few jobs available. I went back to a state university and actually enjoyed my four years there and was able to work as I went along and didn't acquire anymore student loan debt (the only debit I had was from Full Sail). And, believe it or not, I really enjoyed my Gen Ed courses like physch 101, College Algebra, etc (something I know Full Sail touts you don't have to do). I graduated with a computer science degree and was actually able to pay off my Full Sail loan with a bonus I get from a software company that hired me. Best decision I ever made was going back to a state university. It gave me four more years to mature (which I desperately needed), I enjoyed those years (no, I didn't party), I had a great education, and I didn't have any debt as a result. I did enjoy my time at Full Sail, too, however, it was like a blur. It was so fast and so crammed with stuff, that  I'm not sure I was truly able to take it in. Also, as I mentioned, taking on that level of debt just wasn't worth it. Additionally, I would be seriously skeptical of any school that is for profit, like Full Sail is. When that is the case, they are not looking out for your best interest.",

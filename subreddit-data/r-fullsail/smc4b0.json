My college teaches extremely outdated stuff all-around. My only downfall is I struggle with math and I figured Full Sail might be even tougher.",

The biggest difference between fullsail and community College is that fullsail math classes with teach you how you can use them in your degrees, quarternion math in graphics engine programing for example. Sometimes you can transfer credits in, and I highly advise doing so if you have the chance, otherwise the classes themselves are pretty damn good and the teachers that teach them enjoy doing so.",

Calculus is not taught, they just give you the cheat sheet for common derivations. the same goes for the rest of the math/physics topics.\n\nThey only teach you practical and don't teach you the inner workings. If that's enough for you then the math classes are excellent. If you want to know more, then this is not the right place.",

I don't know why calculus is even taught to programmers, there's functions for whatever you need.\n\nThat said, I am in calculus right now, and it's definitely taught. You're given a lot of identities but you also get a grasp of what's actually being told to you (in a much more condensed way than like high school). At least with tugwell",

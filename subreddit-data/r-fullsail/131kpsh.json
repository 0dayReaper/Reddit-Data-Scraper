Does anybody know how make retakes I can take with the Character Modeling Class ? Is it 2 ??? I\u2019m not sure and it\u2019s giving me anxiety of being dismissed from this university \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79",

            "comment": "2 has been the standard threshold lately in Game Art and Computer Animation. They used to be pretty laid back about it, but towards the end of my degree program they were taking the policy extremely seriously. The attendance &amp; re-take policy changed last year and I wasn't aware of it (my own fault for not reading the new handbook) and I had to pay $2,500 before I could graduate. Each time a student re-takes a course now, you'll get hit with a bill for $500 and can re-take it up to 2 times before they start sending you e-mails that your enrollment is at-risk. They won't immediately kick you out and will want to work with you, so make sure you're communicating with the higher-ups about your situation if you can.",

It was like that when I started pre-covid, but after the pandemic ended the university was having a hard time getting students back to campus (we all wanted to stay home), they made major changes to the attendance and re-take policies. Now it's $500 for any re-take.",

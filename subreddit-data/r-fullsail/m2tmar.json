    "postText": "For any of the Game Art (or possibly Computer Animation) students, can you give a few examples or descriptions of what base level of artistic ability is good to have for a Game Art student?\n\nI've heard that they don't really cover the 'basics' but the curriculum still seems to cover light and color, so I guess my question is what level of ability will make it so that you're not already behind on Day 1?",

            "comment": "I'm in Computer Animation, but the classes between the two programs are pretty much a mixture of students from both up until around 'Portfolio 3.' There are two primary 'art' classes, simply Fundamentals of Art 1 and 2.\n\nMy artistic ability was pretty much non-existent. I'm more tech-y than artistic, so I expected to suffer for both classes-- and I did during the first one (still passed). Art 2 is when I decided to really try and practice, practice, practice... I went from drawing stick figures [to this after week 2](https://i.imgur.com/iEvscBm.jpg). (*mildly nsfw, drawing from ref of a nude model*) Not saying this is perfect by any means, but I never in a million years would've thought that I was capable of drawing that.\n\nSo, not to be \"that person,\" but you really do get back what you put into it.. They don't have any expectations of you when entering the class, so don't fret if you're drawing stick figures currently.",

It definitely makes me feel less anxious about jumping in.\n\nThe advisor is actually having me think about Computer Animation or Game Art, and I know that I want to work on video games, so I wonder if the Computer Animation track would set me up to more employment opportunities as a new grad post-degree.",

I went for fine arts a while ago, I do do art in free time, I've done some work. But they set up the class pretty well for beginners. I do suggest if you end up going on, go online and take some free art courses and practice! Esp during your four core courses when its a bit more free time, you can practice easily and feel a bit more prepared if you want to.",

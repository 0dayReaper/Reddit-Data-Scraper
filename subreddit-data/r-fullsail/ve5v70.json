I have the online course that's recommended for the assessment. What are some thing that I should for sure refresh/learn? There's so much material, im not sure what to focus on.",

            "comment": "Honestly, don't. As along as you score a 30, you will get into the program and they will have you take a Pre-Calc and a Calculus class in months 3 and 4. It won't delay your program, you will just take them in addition to the classes you would already have those months.\n\nIf you really want to study though:\n\nBasic Arithmetic\n\nSolve for variable\n\nFactor\n\nFactor Quadratic \n\nEquation of a line\n\nSlope\n\nSin/Cos/Tan\n\nIntegration\n\nDerivatives \n\nSummation \n\nBy your own admission, you never took a Calculus class. You would be doing your self a huge disservice by trying to enter the program without that knowledge. However, if you look up the topics above it should be enough to get you a 30(I believe you would get one anyway) and still get into your program of choice.",

            "comment": "Hey there! \n\nSo, while I am sure I cannot speak for everyone\u2026 I do have an idea. \n\nSee, Full Sail is an entertainment school that happens to offer things like Web Dev, Cyber, CS. While CS is an incredibly popular program (all over) I feel many folks here are targeting something that\u2019ll help them in their respective place in their industry. \n\nI started in CS, but switched to Web Dev myself. Mainly because like others I\u2019m following a passion of mine, development. While I believe a CS degree is more universal, I find the offerings from the Web Dev degree help me in my niche area. Again, this is mainly in part to what I\u2019ll learn down that particular path. \n\nI know a few CS grads from Full Sail that are thriving. They all spoke highly of it. \n\nHope that helps, even a little!",

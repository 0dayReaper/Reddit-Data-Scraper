    "postText": "So I\u2019m 22 and currently a hairstylist living in wa state. After doing hair for a few years I\u2019ve realized this is not what I see myself doing full time for the rest of my career. Ive always loved concerts/live music and have always been fascinated by how people can take an empty room and turn it into a party so to speak. Has anyone taken the show production course and felt like it was useful? I\u2019m currently in touch with some local venues up here in Washington to job shadow with lights/sound. I guess this is my way of testing the waters. I have absolutely no knowledge on any of this stuff. I know it can be self taught but I feel like I\u2019m already so old to be thinking about getting  a B.S. I\u2019ve been saving for a condo here in wa but it\u2019s so expensive and Florida would be a great invest property option for me. I know I\u2019d make way less money down there but I\u2019ve got enough for about half down on a condo in the winter park area. I just don\u2019t want two big loans at once as my family wants no part in helping me financially (which I totally understand I\u2019m 22 lol). What is your experience with the show production program??",

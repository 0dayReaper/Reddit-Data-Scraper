    "postText": "I'm semi-privacy conscious, and going to FSU, does the Launchbox for IT (or any others) have any invasive (i.e. looks at apps you have installed, checks browsing history on Safari) monitoring software included? To be clear, I'm not going to do anything remotely illegal on the MBP included, I just would not like to be tracked if the FSO system gives out so much work per day, and I get done and want to play some Minecraft on the same laptop I've been given, since the only other thing I have is a Chromebook.\n\nCheers,\n~aml",

As far as I know this is on the honor system, but it's a good thing to be aware of.",

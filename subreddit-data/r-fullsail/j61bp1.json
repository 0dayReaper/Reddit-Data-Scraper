    "postText": "I'm considering going to full sail for animation online, I already do 3d modeling and want to forward my education on it. My problem is that I've been in and out of the hospital for 3 months, the doctors aren't even fully sure they know what's wrong but I'm seeing a neurologist next week to look further into it. The guess is I'm having absence seizures or a very particular type of migraine that mimicks strokes that are being caused by stress. I'm leaving my roommates to live on my own in hopes that it will cut back my stress, I have good job offers where I'm moving but with going back to college I don't know if I can handle working consistently with the accelerated courses without ending up in the ER. \nSoooo questions-\nHas anyone had experience with getting student loans to cover living expenses as well? Was it hard to get? Was it enough to afford living by yourself while you attended? I plan to work while attending as much as I can I just want to know what to expect.",

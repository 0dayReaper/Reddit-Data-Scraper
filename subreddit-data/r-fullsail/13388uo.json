And if anyone knows what comes in the launch box that\u2019d be cool. I\u2019m just trying to figure out if I really wanna do this before I make the switch. Any specifics or help regarding the program would be KILLER\ud83d\ude0e",

High expectations and a hard program, no question. If you do the program make sure to not lose anything, you will need to inventory it all. I dropped after I got the equipment and I went on to a better fit for me in education.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m currently in my second month (started April 3) and loving it! Doing the online Digital Cinematography. I am 28yo, but have years of amateur filmmaking experience &amp; audio editing experience. As a kid I made stop-motion Lego films &amp; edited them myself, took film/music/3d animation courses in high school, etc. So I\u2019d say it helps to have experience in this area, but it\u2019s certainly not required if you\u2019re willing to do some extra legwork.\n\nFirst course is Creative Presentation; fast paced but not too difficult for me to keep up. Note: I\u2019m a father of 3, work for a tech company 3rd shift overnight full-time, and am active in church. Saying I\u2019m already busy outside FS is an understatement lol!\n\nThis month is Psychology of Play. Very interesting content &amp; fun to learn! However the workload took me off guard the first week as it is much more than the first class. I can assume future classes will be similar if not more intense from what I\u2019ve heard. But after some schedule re-structuring, I\u2019m able to keep up still. [also as a film enthusiast, psychology definitely does play an integral role in effective filmmaking - especially for films that want to convey a deeper message]\n\nI\u2019m someone that thrives in self-learning &amp; fast paced learning environments, so I\u2019m actually enjoying this &amp; I\u2019m retaining a lot already. But note that FS is definitely beneficial based on what one puts into it and as long as one does not \u201ccoast by\u201d.\n\nRegarding your Launchbox question: this program gets an iPad, nice camera, and MacBook Pro. Also included is about 2 years of access to Adobe Suite for Premiere, etc. I just got the iPad, which is great because the iPad I currently had for my illustration artwork was getting older. I already have an Apple Pencil - if you don\u2019t, I\u2019d recommend getting one. I know we\u2019ll be doing storyboarding later , so it will come in handy.\n\nOur Launchbox also includes other software access like Chop Shop FX, Final Draft, Movie Magic programs, &amp; Adobe CC. Physical components also include SD Adapter, USB-C to USB Adapter, camera lens, camera tripod kit, camera case, the camera itself: Sony Cinema Line FX6 camera, headphones, shotgun microphone, 25ft microphone cable, LED light kit, &amp; a 64gb SDXC card. \u2014 quite a beefy package!\n\nSo if you want to get into filmmaking, the program will guide you thru all the steps. From script writing, storyboarding, to budgeting, filming, lighting, to editing, and post-prod! Not having any knowledge or prior experience would just mean you\u2019d want to pay extra attention or perhaps hit up YouTube guides along the way. I know some other professional industry programs have free online training - such as Davinci Resolve.",

And pay attention to Randy Baker in the composition and visual design class. His is probably the hardest class you will ever do.  He goes far too quickly when talking and the class should really be broken up. in to like three classes.  Are you doing this online?",

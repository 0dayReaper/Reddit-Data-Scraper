There's a lot of things to do and people to be with to progress you towards your goals if you're serious about it. I'm pretty sure they're only issued to campus students as many online students are out of state and wouldn't need one.",

All you have to do, is go to the Business Office with $10 to get your ID paid for and than from there you will go to the Security Office and they will issue you an ID same day. Just have to let them know that you are an online student but you are a local who would like to be able to have access to the doors and stuff like that. Guy I dealt with at Secuity was super nice and was totally okay with giving me a Campus Student ID! Guy in the business office, wasn't too nice but oh well! lol",

The professors are seasoned professionals from across several major and regional networks. Be as involved as you can, listen to any critiques the professors give you and add it to your repertoire. It's a hands on class, so be prepared to work. It's very grulling and it will put you through the paces, but just hang in there and have fun with it!",

While going there I was the play by play announcer for the USC Trojans Hockey team. And now I'm the USPHL Long Beach Shredders Play by play guy. Not too impressive, but I still made some serious connections while there. I'm just plugging away, hopefully making it to the ECHL or CHL. Its completely up to you at the end of the day. Just make the best of whatever you do!",

Now I am, and although I\u2019ve gone through the experience before, I\u2019m nervous. What should I do to prepare for classes? What should I expect? Also, anyone who has started recently, what iPad and MacBook Pro size/year did you receive? I want to protect any items I get from the school and would like to obtain the cases and things prior to the items arriving.\n\nThanks!",

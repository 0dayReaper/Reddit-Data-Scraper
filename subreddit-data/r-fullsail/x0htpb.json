            "comment": "I worked part time while I was at FS for my film degree; it IS possible to do both, but you may have a bit of difficulty finding work since your class schedule will be changing every month; a lot of employers don\u2019t want to bother with dealing with that. Also be prepared to be tired - a lot. FS is an accelerated school so you\u2019re in class almost all day, everyday. Add working on top of that, and you can burn out rather quickly. My sleep schedule was rough during my time there because of this; I\u2019d have class from 9am to let\u2019s say 7pm, then I\u2019d work overnights from 12am to 7am. Very little sleep.",

I cook every day and only go out to eat when I have a class that is all day long, so that's roughly where my idea of a budget stands.\n\nYou could probably get a part time job on campus so your schedule could be flexible, the work is not too bad and your pay is 10 an hour, which all things considered is not the worst, especially since most on campus jobs are hybrid options.",

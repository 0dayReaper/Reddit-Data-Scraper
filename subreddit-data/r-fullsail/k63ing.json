    "postText": "\"I was looking at my receipt of federal direct loans and I saw that my balance is over 40,000 dollars. I wanted to know if this amount has to be paid within a year or another specific time frame. I desperately wanted to ask whether or not it is okay for me to keep attending this school. I know, for a fact, that I cannot afford this amount in a year, or even in 5 years. I have two jobs at the moment that pay minimum wage and it is impossible for me to make payments to Full Sail for my online course AND pay my bills. Not to mention that I have my pets and younger siblings. I do not work enough days to be able to make any kind of payment. This is why I wanted to ask if there is any way I can receive help or if I am going to have to drop out. I am fully capable of sending back the launch box items if that is the case. I need to find out what I can do or what will happen. I am just... afraid.\"\n\nThis is what I sent in to support. Long story short, I decided to attend Full Sail in July 2020 on a whim... I grew tired of just.. going to my minimum wage jobs and then going home to play video games, only to do it all over again the next day. \n\nI did not think any of it through and it went by very fast. I was afraid of doing nothing my whole life. I did not want to be \"stuck\" anymore... I wanted to make something of myself, but now I feel as if I bit off way more than I could chew. I am now in the fourth month of my online courses. Is there anything I can do? Am I just screwed for life? What will happen if I don't pay up? I don't have anything to my name. I am nothing but scared right now.",

You\u2019ll have to start making payments on your loans once you completely finish taking classes, but you\u2019ll have years of payment making ahead of you to pay them all off. Go forth and Fullsail! It\u2019s been a great school for my family. \n\nAlso, call the finance office. They can take you through exactly what you\u2019re getting into. :) \n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "Alrighty, so for FAFSA assistance/federal assistance or loans, as long as you are in school you don't have to pay it, no matter the amount. You have a 1 year grace period AFTER your last class to start paying it back where interest doesn't accrue (you can pay toward it whenever). After that your payment plan kicks in and you pay your installments, whatever they may be. I have one that's based on my income and I pay back about 360/month. You can also file for extensions/forbearance if you're in a rough patch.",

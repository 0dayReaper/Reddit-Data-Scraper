I\u2019m also interested in learning more about the online Music Production program. Anyone who\u2019s attended either program online have any advice or insight into how they were? Just full of questions and hoping to connect with some people  who\u2019ve experienced these programs firsthand. Thanks in advance!",

But very useful for creating music if you can get everything down fast. I actually just switched from music to audio production because I realized I\u2019m going more for engineering and vocal mixing rather than focusing on music creation. Good luck",

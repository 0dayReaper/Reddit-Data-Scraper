    "postText": "I was considering the game development online program. The admissions and enrollment people told me to expect 10-15 hours of work per week, which is doable given my work schedule. But then the orientation says to expect 30-40 hours of work per week, which is very difficult to do when working full-time.\n\nSo for anyone who has done the online game development program, what is the work load like? Is it closer to 10-15 or closer to 30-40?",

The only class that took more of my time are ones that have group projects That took like 20 - 30 a week because I was carrying them through it.\n\nEdit: That sounded way to cockier then I intended, but I did like 80% of the work on the project with a 6 person team",

The two class months were simple as the \"seminar\" classes were minimal work.\n\nThe only thing I really didn't like about the school was that they allow D's to pass and a few people on my team for group projects were as dumb as bags of hammers. But they squeaked through and might have the same paper as me.  \n\nIt was worth it to me as I got a job with a game studio immediately after getting my piece of paper.",

            "comment": "Different classes have different workloads, so it's going to be a coin toss no matter how you do it. Fortunately, since your working full time and will be online the teachers are usually more lenient with the due dates for submissions, (they usually are for students with jobs).\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is again the differing classes. Since you have experience in c# programming classes like programming 1 and 2 might seem like a joke in terms of workload, simply due to how easy they are for people that have experience in the field, but a class like the midterm project,  Computer Graphics, or AI might shock you as to how might of a difficulty spike they have in spite of the fact that there is technically less homework, as the raw material is so much more advanced.\n\nI took the extended Simulation and visualization degree which share almost all of its programming classes with Game Dev, but even being on the extended program where I focused usually only on 1 class I struggled a lot, as before full Sail I had basic high school programming experiences.\n\nIf you decide to take the leap into full Sail and your looking for a degree to be able to accelerate in your field of work, mentally prepare yourself for about 2.5 years of college on top of your current workload. It's absolutely possible and many people do it, but definitely something that you should be ready for.\n\nAnother note is that with full sails unique class structure you have the opportunity for breaks! This is huge as sometimes you need a month of time to catch up on life outside of school. It doesn't affect tuition or your GPA at all, it only affect your graduation date, and while the school says you can only do it 4-5 times they will work with you to better your chances of graduating.\n\nBeing a student here is overall tough, and if your on the edge of deciding I would suggest taking a class or two at a community College near you first to see if you even want to bother with it, as while it is significantly cheaper that traditional college, full Sail still costs a heck of a lot of money (in graduating with around 32k in fafsa loans as an on campus student).\n\nHope this helps put things into perspective. Make and informed decision, but keep in mind you can't know all the details ahead of time.",

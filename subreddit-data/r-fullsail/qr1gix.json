    "postText": "   Alright so I am in English composition 2 and in my first week I completely flunked on my non fiction article plan like Karen price gave me a zero and she graded it kind of last minute, but she gave me a second chance  without me having to ask and I didn't see this was open so she gave another chance and said she will grade it with my article. I've been to scad and the younger professors aren't harsh graders but the older ones will destroy you so the fact that this woman was like hey here's another chance and she re graded and gave me a 100 was mind blowing because even though I'm usually on top of my game,  the first week I was just out of it and I can accept when I did bad because I know I can get back to an A with no problem. People talk so much mess about full sail but going to 3 colleges full sail university has got to be number 1 for me and scad is like all the way to the bottom. I feel like this university wants you to succeed while others are like as long as you pay us back we'll be on good terms. I feel like I had to say this because I might be in love... im gonna do my hw now.",

I struggled with opinion writing versus academic writing and flunked. I got feedback and another few days for a RE-write, ended up with a 98. I learned a lot in that class, although I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever try opinion writing professionally!",

Anyways I\u2019m currently really wanting to attend full sail online for game development to get my bachelors, and right now I\u2019m in the process of talking with advisors at my current college to try to find free hand me out scholarships, and some challenging ones, not like full ride challenging, but at least a long lists of ones to try for, since my fasfa won\u2019t pay the entire tuition. I honestly can\u2019t wait, and if I can\u2019t get all I need out of scholarships, I plan on taking a year off to try to use my associates, that I will have, to get a entry level job on indeed or something and work for the rest, or if push comes to shove go to Walmart or brookshires and stock shelves for about a year and get more money. Anyways, I can\u2019t wait for the time to come that I am able to attend.",

Everyone says that fs is commercial but they will give you opportunities non stop so I think you will enjoy it especially for game development, because no moon is still looking for people to hire.",

Full Sail may not be the top-tier, uppity Art School but the education is high quality and you get what you put into it. We have all the resources and pretty amazingly relaxed professors.\n\n*Graphic Design Major*",

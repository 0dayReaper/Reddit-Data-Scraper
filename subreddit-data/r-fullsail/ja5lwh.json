    "postText": "Looking through the different LaunchBox packages that are available for different majors I noticed that the Game Dev offers a MSI laptop instead of the MacBook that comes with all the others. Is there anyway of getting this laptop instead of the MacBook for other majors? \n\nI also noticed that most (of not all) of the LaunchBox packages I have looked at include Microsoft Windows. I am curios as to how that is needed at all if all of the products in the packages are Apple?",

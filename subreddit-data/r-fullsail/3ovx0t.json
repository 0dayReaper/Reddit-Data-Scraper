This school is also VERY HARD. On top of the 8 hours a day you are in class or a lab, you have to network and find other opportunities around campus. Literally the last half of the program there is a department dedicated to helping you find a job and build a portfolio.\nBlaming the school for your debt and lack of job does nothing. That was all on you, not the school.",

The line I heard repeatedly is \"Full Sail is exactly what you make of it.\" If you work hard, accept criticism, stay positive, and take advantage of every opportunity (of which there are numerous) to learn, improve, and network, you'll go far. If you coast through and expect great things to be delivered to you, you're going to be met with disappointment.\n\nAnd if you think the \"real world\" is any different, you're in for a shock.",

I wouldn't have the skills I have today if it weren't for fullsail. One of the biggest things I learned was how to adapt and learn new technologies in short periods of time and in this industry that's a must. I also learned how to work effectively in a team. \n\nFrom the complaints I have read and heard, I feel like many people thought they would just magically be handed a job upon graduating from fullsail. I don't know where this rumor spread but life doesn't just hand you things, you have to earn them and work for them. \n\nI coasted through highschool sleeping every day and had a gpa above 4.0 and was in the top 10 highest gpa in my graduating class. When I got to fullsail, I got my butt kicked b/c I had to actually learn new concepts and it was serious business, no more just coasting through not paying attention and sleeping through class. I learned many great life lessons and met many great individuals",

            "comment": "I have mixed feelings about graduating from the school. I felt like I learned a lot but ultimately I wasn't prepared fully for a career. Now this may be in large part due to the fact I did online classes so I didn't have the amount of interaction on campus students have, but I do think the content was excellent and MOST of the teachers were amazing. I unfortunately didn't receive the harsh feedback I needed to ensure the career I wanted (Character modeling) I was good enough for until the very last class I took when my A+ projects were being viewed as C+ projects from a different teacher. I graduated Valedictorian of my class as well. If I could do it again I would 100% go to campus instead of online. \n\nI unfortunately am not making anywhere near the amount of money (only 26k a year before taxes and it is not related to my degree at all) I need to be paying off my debt so it has increased quite a bit. I'm currently in the process of contacting the school to be able to sit in on classes again and I'm going to basically take all of my modeling classes from a certain point on. This aspect in itself is well worth the money spent on the school because I can essentially retake any class I want at any time and learn the new process again. \n\nOverall though, good school. ",

But I kept at it and kept chasing better job offers.  My current job is a dream.  I make a modest salary of 60000, but I'm doing what I 'm good at and love every day.  It takes time and effort to get into the industry, but it's easily doable with a bit of luck.  The angry remarks towards the school come from people who thought having a piece of paper would secure them a job.  I understand where they're coming from though, the school uses some pretty misleading claims to recruit.  My advice is take advantage of the fact that we are in an industry that doesn't care about education, only your portfolio.  So make a good one and bust your ass.",

I've seen this excuse used so many times I am starting to legitimately believe that graduates have this ingrained into their head by some of the school's staff - Or someone in their PR department lacks creativity when defending their school online.",

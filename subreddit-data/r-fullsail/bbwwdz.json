The job I\u2019m looking at has amazing pay but you work 7 days a week, 56+ hours a week. Would I still have time to get my classwork done and have time for the gym and a social life?",

            "comment": "Honestly your first 4 months are intro/fluff classes. It\u2019s the \u201cwelcome to full sail stage\u201d. So in theory yes, however they all still count to your overall progress. \n\nOnline plus working is doable. You just have to make sure that you make time and devote energy to completing assignments throughout the months. (Each class is one month long). 56 hours a week is a lot of time. Considering you are encouraged to be spending 20 hours per week on assignments. \n\nIf you put in the work and sacrifice the time then yeah you\u2019ll be solid. I worked full time while doing my degree and though it was stressful I made it work. So evaluate everything first.",

The first four months are just required credits, they aren\u2019t all that interesting, but also won\u2019t take up a lot of time. The first challenging class will be the one geared for your major. For me in Game Art, that was 3D Foundations. This class can take 20-40+ hours a week depending on how quickly you pick things up, and if you run into any trouble. From my experience, this class and the one that follows it, Model Creation, are a bit infamous for needing to be retaken a couple of times. I think the amount of work required in these two classes is meant to weed out those who are just hoping to skate by. Overall, the Online programs are very doable while working a full time job (I\u2019m a network engineer) but it won\u2019t always be easy, and you\u2019ll definitely make compromises from time to time.",

            "comment": "I'm currently month 9 in audio production BS. Some classes I've spent 10 hrs total on. Some I've spent 40+. I work as a handyman in between and I'm staying pretty busy. It is starting to get hard to keep working and doing good in school at the same time. I ended up taking a month off in Feb to catch up on work and bills. So my answer is that it is going to be hard at times and easy at times to work that much and come home and have time for school. I love it though and I'm glad I am doing it. I am starting a paid internship in May. I recommend looking for something to get you a job or internship that relates to your degree asap.",

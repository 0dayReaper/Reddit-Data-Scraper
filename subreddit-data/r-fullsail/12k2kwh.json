You\u2019re best bet is going to be to buckle down and do more studying other than what is being taught, find ways that work for you yourself, and from there you will succeed with no problem.  I have faith in you as I do myself, I\u2019m struggling in my class right now and I\u2019m scared because I have a 4.0 and I feel like it\u2019s going to drop down after this class.  But I\u2019m willing and able to do the extra work to learn it myself so I can succeed.  If you feel changing degree will help, by all means go ahead and call admissions, they will help you.",

            "comment": "Hiya! I actually had a similar issue; I moved from Game Design BSC to Game Art BSC. I didn't have the necessary academic benchmarks for Game Des. Discreet Mathematics course, and was suggested that my skills would better fit the Game Art program. I've been happy as can be in my new spot and it's been a blast.   \nMy personal experience with it might be able to help provide some insight into changing your Major.   \nFirst, contact the student advisors! They're very helpful people that are usually more than happy to discuss your academic situation. They were the kindly folks that helped me determine the best place for me to be- so I'm more than confident they can provide that same assistance to you!   \nSecond, since we're currently (at the time of writing this) starting Week 3 of the April '23 term- it is actually too late to reschedule into a different course. You might be recommended to drop this month's course. But, if you can stick out the rest of the month, I would recommend doing so! Even if it isn't the best grade, just aim for the pass! I believe in ya!   \nThird, because you're still part way through your first semester, you will be asked to wait until the semester is over for degree-changes to go through. However, it is possible to take classes that might overlap with both your old program and your new program- during my transfer I did get to take classes like \"Mythology and Historical Archetypes\" an English/writing course, and so-on.  \n\n\nI've had really good results, speaking with the advising team. I have phone anxiety, so I know it can be reassuring to hear from other students their experiences- and I can say for sure that I've not had a bad experience yet! \n\nBest of luck to ya' my fellow math-challenged individual!",

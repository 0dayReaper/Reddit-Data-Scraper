    "postText": "So, I just graduated yesterday and got my bachelor\u2019s in creative writing, however, I want to go back for game design or development. I just don\u2019t know which one. I believe I should go into game design because that field focuses on stories, art work, basically the outline of the game. \n\nHowever, I still need to know c# c++ and I think python. I\u2019m taking a course from unreal Sensei on beginners development and I\u2019m hoping that\u2019ll give the basic root for what I need to know. So does game design for full sail offers that particular training in coding or should I do another 2 years in bachelor\u2019s?",

If you feel short on programming skills, you can supplement via a Bootcamp, Udemy, or coursera for low/no cost. \n\nDevelopment is skews programming. If you go down that road, you\u2019re looking at a tech designer, or gameplay programmer route to best utilize that creative writing degree.",

Thus, a design degree makes more sense here. If you wanted to supplement that design degree with stronger programming skills, you could pick them up via things like Udemy. \n\nIf you chose the development (programming degree) route, the creative writing skill set would not be as useful to you\u2019re everyday work.",

It might not be immediately what you want, you might have to start at QA and work your way up but you won\u2019t be stuck there for long. Have many friends who graduated and have found them selves doing what they want at a AAA.",

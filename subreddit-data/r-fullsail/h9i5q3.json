    "postText": "Hey everyone. I'm wondering if anyone has had success in transferring credits in the graphic design degree. I have an Associates Degree in Graphic Design from my local community college and have worked in the field for 3 years. I wanted to just do some continuing learning and earn a Bachelors to be more competitive in applying places. The only two classes that transferred however are my english and math. I really don't want to retake classes such as color theory, art history, graphic principals I, design and art theory, etc. I've sent an email and am waiting for a response, just curious if anyone has been successful or if I am wasting my time. Thanks yall.",

    "postText": "Just curious to know other people's personal experiences. I'm starting soon in the Game Art BA and they've offered me a hybrid plan where I work online for six months and then move to campus to finish the degree.\n\nI was told my first six months will actually be the first two months of the course program, which I also prefer because I'm trying to ease back into school. (I've read other posts about the Game Art program, I know I'm going to be super busy when I get to campus lol)\n\nHas anyone else done this? How thoroughly do they help with finding housing and roommates? I know I want to go to campus to meet peers, and I also just want to switch states. But I'm really wondering if anyone has opinions on this.\n\nThanks in advance!",

The first 6 months are pretty chill, I think 3D foundations was the first challenging class I had. Being on campus is definitely busier, but I think it\u2019s worth it, there\u2019s a lot of benefit from attending in person. Online-only is just not as involved.\n\nFor the housing/roommates situation. You have advisors who will help you create a roommate profile (contains ur contact info, what apartments you\u2019re interested in, how many roommates you want, a brief summary of yourself, etc.). They will put yours and other students profiles on a pdf that gets sent out every week to all students still looking for roommates. \n\nThere\u2019s also a pdf that gets updated often with important info on the local apartments. I think it\u2019s available on the fullsail housing page, but they email it to you too. \n\nOnce you secure a roommate/apartment, you should tell the school so your name gets taken off the roommate list.",

(I'm online, by the way, not campus.) I'd like to get a case and keyboard for the iPad (I know it's a base model iPad, but not what year/configuration), as well as a case, keyboard cover, screen protector, etc. for the MacBook Pro.\n\nCan anyone let me know what was included in theirs if they got their box within the past few months? I should get mine in 1-2 months depending on how many class credits transfer.",

    "postText": "I'm going into my junior year of High school in the fall and I'm at a bit of a stand still. I still don't have a clue what I want to study, and my first two years of high school have been squandered. I haven't played any sports, I joined E-Sports club but dropped out, and my grades have been subpar (never above a 3.0 but never below a 2.3). My mom went to Full Sail and I've always wanted to go. I know my mediocrity won't let me get into my dream school but I'm lost as to what I should be doing to set myself up on the right path for success. Are there any alumni who have been in my situation that can spare some advice?",

            "comment": "Hi, I loved my time at Full Sail, but would only really recommend it to someone that knows they really want to go into the field they choose to major in. I did 2 years at other colleges and you get to know if you really want to pursue those careers. I did not, and then I transferred to Full Sail and got my degree in Film. \n\nAt Full Sail you really immerse yourself in that one major and you don't take many unrelated courses (a couple english courses, a couple math classes) but nothing like you would get at a \"normal\" college. If you aren't sure, go to a liberal arts school or a community college and take a variety of classes before you make a decision because it's not like Full Sail is cheap. \n\nWilling to discuss more if you have questions please feel free to DM.",

You get 2 years to goof off and party and experience college, but also two years to get closer to figuring out what it is you\u2019re interested in. Plus it\u2019s way cheaper than university and you get to transfer over your classes. When I started FS I didn\u2019t have to take any of the math, English or psych classes, just got to dive in to my degree program. I\u2019d say take a look at what FS degree you\u2019re interested in, and dip your toes in as well as you can in community college. FS is pretty much $5000 a month, so it\u2019s important to be sure of what you want to go into. However if you choose to go there first and DO go through those generic classes you have time to see what the other programs do up close and have time to switch during those months. But I\u2019m pretty sure I got my AA degree for less money than 2 months at full sail.",

And if you don\u2019t know what you want to do yet then it sounds like you\u2019re not quite ready to jump into your career. Definitely do a full sail tour of whatever degrees you\u2019re interested in so you can get a taste of what the school has to offer",

If you\u2019re only 18 and you already have your AA you\u2019d be entering the work force at only 20 and that\u2019s pretty damn young If u ask me. Community college was 2 of the best years of my life honestly, and most people take 4 or more years in college anyways so it\u2019s not like you\u2019d be falling behind. And since you\u2019re not sure what you want to do yet, Full Sail isn\u2019t the most cost effective option. It sounds like your mom is exerting some pressure on you to finish school as soon as possible, but you only get to go to college once (for the first time- unless you go back) so you should take some time to think about what YOU want out of these years. I wanted to party and experiment and Community college gave me that freedom for 2 years, and now I\u2019m cracking down in FS and focusing on my school more. If I didn\u2019t have those 2 years to explore adulthood I\u2019d probably have burnt out in FS. FS is NOT the place to fool around, you\u2019ve gotta have your head in the game 24/7 it\u2019s pretty intense.",

Full Sail's a fine school and all, but it doesn't guarantee you a job and you'll be paying ~$1000/month in student loans for the next ~15 years of your life.  You should only make that kind of a commitment if you know that you can handle that responsibility on your own (IE know what job you are going for).\n\nIf I was in your position, I'd take some classes at a community college and/or work and put some money away.",

The first 2 months are pretty generic for all degrees so as long as you get in touch with your academic advisor assigned to you, there should be no issues with changing your degree by the start of the new year. Good luck on everything! And don't second guess yourself, I know the programs can run fast but if you're confident in your work you will do great\u263a\ufe0f",

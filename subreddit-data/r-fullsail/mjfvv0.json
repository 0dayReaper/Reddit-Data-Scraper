I have heard that there isn\u2019t much time to do other things and then I have heard that you will have some free time. I\u2019m curious if there is free time to go the gym and lift weights?",

I also had more than enough time to network out of school, check out some cool spots and venues, go to some parties, attend extra seminars at campus and was apart of some clubs. \n\nIt\u2019s all about balance, and making sure you stay on too of your school work so that you can make the time to do other things",

Being next to Orlando I'm sure I will want to take advantage of all the entertainment over there. Thanks for this response man this was a question I was thinking about a lot as well.",

I was Creative Writing and my class/homework time was reasonably light in comparison to some of the others (Around two-four hours for class then another hour or two on homework.) I do believe some courses have around 6+ hour periods whenever labs roll around. Anyone able to confirm?",

There's a 24-hour fitness right in Winter Park that is really convenient since you can go at any time. It makes it a lot easier to work around your schedule than places with more limited hours like apartment complex gyms.",

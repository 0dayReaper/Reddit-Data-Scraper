If you challenge yourself and be honest with yourself, that will set you up for success from the start. Our instructors want us to succeed, so they are your best resource, so don\u2019t feel insecure about not having experience. If you apply yourself, take interest in your development, and are teachable, you\u2019ll do fine.",

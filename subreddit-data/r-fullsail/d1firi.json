What have you heard/seen from other students in the digital marketing program that would be of interest (or just helpful) to me? \n\nI spoke with an admissions counselor yesterday to confirm and finalize enrollment documents and whatnot. \nI\u2019m excited as most of the college classes I took in the past had been more science based, and therefore,\nwere extremely stressful and not much fun.",

Are you gonna be campus or online? I have done both. Campus is really fun and there is always something entertaining going on at campus. The closest to digital marketing I have seen was media communications. My boyfriend is in that program as an online student.",

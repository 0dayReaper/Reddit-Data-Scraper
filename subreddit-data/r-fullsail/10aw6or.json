    "postText": "So I\u2019m looking at Full Sail for Creative Writing BFA, but from some reviews I\u2019ve read it seems like this school has some problems. I need to use my GI Bill, so it won\u2019t be out of pocket, are there any current or former students that can recommend this course or school?",

You get what you put in, make connections, take advantage of the career dev, and keep an ongoing dialog with your professors even after the class. show interest and join projects your peers are starting, and network around school as much as you can. Creative Writing is an incredibly difficult field to work in after you get a degree, so understand what you're getting into and work toward your goals and be ready to pivot if that changes. For example, I wanted to write tv/films. And though I do that to a small degree, most of my work is in the editing business. Most of the people that I see that have failed at doing something with their degree (the ones I kept in touch with) are the ones who barely did anything in university and just did the coursework and moved on.",

Not sure if you\u2019ve already applied, but they do a good job of making it feel like they care about you &amp; want you, which is more than I can say for the other schools I reached out to for the same program. Academy of Art, SCAD, LA Film School.. price wise, they all run roughly the same. The things that have me eyeing Full Sail are the ability to take classes in your major for free, post graduation, as well as having the dedicated team for career advancement. Sorry, I know you asked for current or former students, just wanted you to know you\u2019re not alone in questioning these things. Wishing you luck!!",

Keeping this short if it wasn\u2019t for gi bill I would of dropped out sooner school is over price compared to others. They taught me nothing. There is no honors everybody just kinda gets pushed along. Don\u2019t go is my short answer and go to another school. They do advertisement for a reason to get you motivated. Yes you get what you put in is the dumbest thing I heard that\u2019s for every college and everything you do but this one you literally only get what you put in aka watch YouTube videos from 2016 that not even the school did. I was BA in game development hope my feedback helps your decision.",

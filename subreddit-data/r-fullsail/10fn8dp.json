            "comment": "I went for computer animation primarily on-campus, but the majority of my schooling was online due to the pandemic. You will absolutely get what you put into it. IMO, the successful graduates are the ones that have put their nose to the grindstone and didn't let up off the gas pedal at all throughout the entire degree. A lot of the \"bad reviews\" are from students that either dropped/burned out or just rode the wave and performed to the minimum turn-in requirement for projects. \n\nThat being said, there are some valid criticisms for the school and faculty. Having a new class each month can be both good and bad, depending on how you look at it. There may be a few bad apple instructors that are a little more \"hands off\" than you'd probably like and are difficult to get in contact with, but the majority of them are great and passionate about teaching.",

Will that\u2019s not at full sail I even had a teacher tell me sink or swim because that\u2019s how the industry is. \n\nYou want homework that makes you feel like if you understand it you are better prepared for the job market. Will at full sail it\u2019s homework goes back as far as I can tell some from 2006. The homework is old and never updated. Why? Because money keep the engine going as long as happy new students keep joining then the money keeps coming in why spend money on a good teaching resources. \n\nI could go for days. I\u2019m not the smartest or the dumbest person in the room but just go to another school full sail is good advertisement that\u2019s it. Go ahead pay 55k and learn nothing close to that value. \n\nIf you message me I\u2019ll tell you every class and what you will do from a to z can be a easy discord chat for about 15 min",

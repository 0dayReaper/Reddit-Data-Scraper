    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI\u2019m a senior in high school about to graduate and it\u2019s super hard for looking into colleges that I want to go too. I have Florida Pre-paid and I was looking into full sail in person for their graphic design degree. I also wanted to know if the school was worth it, i\u2019ve seen so many mixed answers but I know any school is not for anyone. I\u2019m curious on what kind of atmosphere it is. Anyways, If anyone knows if they accept FPP it please let me know, thanks :)",

            "comment": "Their site doesn\u2019t really seem to address that directly, although the Florida Prepaid site suggests it can be used at technical school\u2019s like FS. On that question, your best bet is to call their financial aid office. \n\nAs to the experience of going there, if you want a college experience, FS is not really that. Sure, there are clubs, but everyone\u2019s too busy to really put much into them, and the courses move so fast that people graduate constantly, so the student leadership is a little unstable in those things. It\u2019s wall to wall classes, everyone lives in apartments off campus, and it\u2019s over in 2 years and you need to go find a job. If your dream is to enter the workforce for the rest of your life as soon as possible, they\u2019ll definitely make that possible. \n\nIf you want more of a campus experience, don\u2019t miss out on the very excellent arts programs at FL universities. Even giant schools that FL prepaid was designed for like UCF have solid arts and design departments, plus the whole 4 year college experience (getting away from home for the first time, new friends, new experiences) to boot, and schools like Ringling or Miami International University have stunning arts programs that will let you push your skills and abilities beyond just \u201cget a job.\u201d \n\nLook at your options and consider what kind of experience you want and what your priorities are for your college experience, if you see it as a transaction of knowledge so you can start working, or if you want to learn and grow as a person over time. Since you have prepaid, you have the flexibility to think about that. \n\nGood luck!",

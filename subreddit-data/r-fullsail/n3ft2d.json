            "comment": "I am 8 months in for the bachelors program, and so far it's been Maya. ZBrush has been mentioned, but not touched or taught. Up till now the software used has been Maya, Substance painter, Photoshop, Premier, Excel and Word.  Some classes are also using slightly older versions of Maya right now 2018 is the oldest version I have seen used. But that shouldn't change things too much.\n\nAs a side note I have also used Blender on a couple projects without telling anyone bc it doesn't get bogged down by object history. Like Maya does, and as well it just typically handles some things a little better for my workflow.\n\nMost everything up till now has been about reinforcing the core concepts of art and 3D that most people tend to need to focus on. Also I am an online student, but I don't think that changes things too much as well.",

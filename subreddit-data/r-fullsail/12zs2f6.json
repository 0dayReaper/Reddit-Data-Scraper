I just got back from an intensive filmmaking workshop and am eager to get back on set.\n\nIf not, would anyone be up to collaborate and potentially make something together?",

I usually end u- learning some of the basics from the class and projects, but the real learning comes from deep diving into the topics yourself. You can easily pass the classes with just the course information, but if you want to excel and standout among your peers, take the extra time to look up books on the subjects and read them; get on YouTube or Skillshare and absorb all the information available on whatever class or topic you can. Plus it all only makes the classes that much easier lol if you have any other questions you can shoot me a pm. More than happy to answer what questions I can!",

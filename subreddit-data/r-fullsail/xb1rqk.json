    "postText": "Did you enjoy living there? I\u2019m starting in my Full Sail journey in January for a BS in Computer Animation. Looking to stay in one of these three places, but I\u2019m also trying to see where other students are. Would love to be somewhere that\u2019s known for its collaboration and fun recreation. Is there a particular place that you would recommend as someone who has stayed or maybe heard of these apartments?\n\nEven if it\u2019s not directly in correlation with these apartments, how would you rate your experience? \n\nOn yet another note, is spikeball something that\u2019s big down here? Would love to meet some new faces and be active.",

I say, rent to a price point and preferred location. I lived in the complex next door to whisper lake. kinda ratty and had three car break ins over 10 years but not the worst place in the world. - I will say if you rent a condo you have a better chance of living in a nicer built-out place overall.\n\n[This unit](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/614-Saint-Johns-Ct-Winter-Park-FL-32792/2134706431_zpid/) is about as close as possible to campus as you can be, and is slightly less money and more square feet than same size at solis and that walk *sucks.*",

Starting in Jan should help too as far as securing a place without a lot of pressure. Kepp in mind for places on the **west** side of semoran/436 and the **north** side of university, if you're trying to walk or bike, mind the crosswalks because these are seriously dangerous roads to cross jay. Depending on your program you'll be finishing most days in different locations, but you'll likely have classes in all three buildings across the \"corner\" that it occupies.\n\nIf you have a car/are planning on driving, baldwin park is great but if you're too deep they have traffic of their own. If I was going to do a do-over myself I'd probably live more west, *into* winter park proper, colonialtown, Audubon park, maitland- all these areas have come around a lot the past 5+ years",

            "comment": "I lived in Solis for 5 years, and a friend of mine just moved out of Whisper Lake. I had a great experience at Solis, the apartments were great, and amenities are better than most places. I never used them much, and the community itself didn't really promote it, but when I was there they had a nice gym, volley, ball, basketball, indoor rachet ball, and dog park. They had some of the best, most consistent Internet around and, most importantly, the rent seemed pretty cheap for what I got.\n\nMy friend's experience with Whisper Lake was somewhat similar. Whisper Lake has a kind of camp ground feel, which was appealing to her, they have nice grounds, a okay gym, good laundry on grounds if you need it. They have rachet ball and basketball as well. The apartment isn't quit as nice as Solis was when I lived there, but the price, location, and floor plan were by far the best we found in the area for the price.",

When I checked out solis I didnt think there were racquetball or volleyball areas, but it\u2019s possible the tour just didn\u2019t cover them. I heard from a friend that the solis wifi was pretty crap but I\u2019m glad to hear such good reviews from you! \n\nI liked whisper a lot, but you\u2019re right, didn\u2019t seem like the nicest gym compared to solis. \n\nThanks for the info! Much appreciated",

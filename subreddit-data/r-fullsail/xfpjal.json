In case you don\u2019t know what any of that is: you make 3D things, you give them colors and textures, either very hyper realistic or stylized (like WoW or LoL or 3D Super Mario games) and learn how the give them bones and move them around and make them look very realistic. \nC++ is almost near useless for the Game Art major and cant be used anywhere since you wont be developing or designing a game. Its still always great to learn something like C++ and it can help you later on when looking for a job in the industry.\n\nIn Game Art you will learn about art as well, such as sketching, basic art knowledge, art history etc. \nI recommend you practice art and especially understanding what makes art GOOD ART. What makes visual design good, what makes visual creations engaging, visual story telling, concept art etc. you can start by watching artwork analysis videos on youtube. I also recommend watching videos on music composition and movie direction which gives you a good view on art as a whole and a sense of quality which will help you determine if you\u2019re making something good or not. \n\nIf you\u2019re into programming and more digital stuff I suggest you try Game Design! \n\nAgain, Full Sail does provide you with art classes but as someone with a Art and Graphic Design High School Diploma, I felt that it wasn\u2019t enough and I know that all the passionate kids in Game Art do a lot of art on the side. \n\nEvery month I see kids who submit assignments that complete all standards and requirements for the grades which is the bare minimum. I and a few kids will passionately put all out time to create really good things, not because of grades or anything but because we want good portfolios and enjoy creating master pieces (at this level). So my biggest advice to anyone taking any major at Full Sail is to go AT FULL SAIL (no pun intended) and put your all into what you do, don\u2019t force it, I\u2019m hoping you\u2019re passionate about your major and get to enjoy putting a lot of time and effort into it because at the end it feels so good.\n\nFull Sail recently gave me a shout out on their socials for one of my works and it made me want to take all nighters working on school projects.\n\nAt my very first 3D class I was scared as shit, ngl I even failed the first time. I had panic attacks but very very soon I was at top of every class. At first its like piloting a spaceship but soon it becomes like playing a video game! \n\nPractice and enjoy your time no matter what kinda school related thing you\u2019re doing.",

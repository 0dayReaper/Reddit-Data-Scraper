    "postText": "First of all, forgive me if I have any misstypes in here, and I'm not so sure how to make this post because i'm pretty bad at stuff like this...\n\nSo, today I saw the ad and got interested in doing the postgraduate program, I got untill July 2020 for my graduation here, so I decided to do some research about Full Sail, and most of the opinions that I found are... *ambiguous*, and from 3yrs ago, and they did mention that Full Sail was changing their programs on that year, alongside that the opinions were only about graduation, nothing about postgraduate.\n\nBesides, I didn't find anything on their site about that program I saw the ad in, I did request contect through it though, but my biggest concern is about being ripped off (Since it already happed to me on my 1st college, the Digital Games one is my 2nd college), considering I'm leaving the country to specifically dedicate myself in it.\n\nI'm not sure if its okay to tell which college I'm coming from, but what I can tell is that I dont have a subject of preference or specialty, since I did a little of everything on all the projects that I worked on, bending a little towards 3d Modelling and UV mapping.\n\nMany thanks in advance for anybody who answers this post.",

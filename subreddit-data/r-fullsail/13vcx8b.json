    "postText": "I'm honestly considering dropping out of Full Sail. I started my online classes back in November of 2022. I'm in my May Classes right now. My program is Computer Animation and I'm honestly not getting any kind of motivation nor really finding interest of anything I'm working on in these classes. I'm just wondering if I do end up dropping out, would I have to owe a lot of money?",

Talk to a Financial Aid advisor to have a specific discussion about how much.\n\nYou\u2019ll have a six-month deference by default before you have to start paying the loans off, but you can apply for additional deference based on your financial situation.",

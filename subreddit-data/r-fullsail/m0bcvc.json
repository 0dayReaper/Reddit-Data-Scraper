    "postText": "So this week we have a grammar check in assignment. I believe it\u2019s a quiz of some sort and I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t do well. How many questions is it? Is there any tips on passing it or material to study to get a good grade? We only have 3 attempts at it.\n\nUPDATE: I took the quiz and got a 100 on my first attempt. It gives you multiple options to choose from which make narrowing down the correct answer easier. It does change the way the questions are answered though. Some are \u201cselect all that are correct/incorrect\u201d style and others are \u201cfill in the blank\u201d style. Thank you all for your comments.",

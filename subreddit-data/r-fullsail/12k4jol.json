    "postText": "Howdy! I am in the process of completing the application process and am a little concerned that they have been so pushy about completing the FAFSA (which is fine, you just add the school that isn\u2019t really a commitment) as an admissions requirement, and that some of the To Dos are the MPN and Stafford Loan Entrance Counseling. If I refuse to sign the MPN/Loan Entrance, is that really going to keep me from taking classes?\n\nI work for a university but it\u2019s not a for-profit. This just seems really off putting to have me sign a promissory note without a loan offer or any details on how payment works.",

            "comment": "Don\u2019t let them rush you. Take your time to understand it all. And then proceed at your pace. They are pushy about FAFSA  so they can see how much you\u2019ll need left to pay or not pay for school for the current attending year. (And possibly second year if doing both FAFSA years like I did) They want to have all the data necessary so they can give you an accurate to general idea of your tuition breakdown. FAFSA results can take 3-5 days I believe. \nTo answer your question. You do not have to sign the MPN and Entrance counseling immediately. You can do FAFSA, get the results of any Pell grants/ loans awarded and then ask them questions of your tuition breakdown. \nFor context. I submitted those MPN/ entrance counseling just about last after getting all the information I needed to know about debt and anything else I had concerns about that would be remaining after graduating or while attending. I also signed the enrollment agreement last. \nBut they will all need to be completed before you begin class yes.",

Like I said, I work for a university and I talk about FAFSA all day every day and filling out the FAFSA I understand, that\u2019s harmless; requiring to sign an MPN and do the counseling (which they are using some outdated language on) without seeing a Cost of Attendance/offer letter is just really shady and unnecessary. \n\nI know I\u2019m not going to get any need-based aid, just loans offered (married, grad student.) I tell the kids I work with every day not to just sign things when it comes to loans, and it kind of makes me sad this is how this is going.",

The tuition price is listed in their website for each field of study online or on campus. They\u2019re not shady. They are a for profit school. They want to get as many students in as classes do start every month.\nAlso they may be under the assumption that you\u2019re committing to attend which is why someone in your conversation was giving you the to dos on MPN and EC. Even if you sign everything and completed it all. You still have the option to void your decision to attend.(talk to them about that information as idk the details) Offer/acceptance letters are sent to everyone all are accepted who wish to attend. Though it\u2019s not like any other traditional uni. Being a grad you\u2019re already at an advantage because you understand the college system of what it takes to earn a degree. \nAlso it really is everyone\u2019s duty to understand what they are reading and exactly what you said not just sign things when it comes to loans. i.e. what Stanford loans are? what\u2019s subsidized vs unsubsidized. Interest rate over time etc. \nfurthermore, it is best to ask them all questions before even committing anything. They\u2019re more than welcome to give you all information. Being a grad student I\u2019m sure some credits will transfer over and reduce tuition just depends. Every one situations different. Also if you\u2019re sure you\u2019ll only get loans. They accept scholarships. On their website it says you may be eligible to receive their momentum scholarship(online only degree) which gives you up to 25k though the other side to getting that is if you accept all FAFSA help first(grants and loan) they have a on campus one up to 15k for those with good academic gpa. Anyways I hope this gives you some insight on what to talk to them about. Wether you attend or not attend. It\u2019s nice to get some information to get the pros and cons and weigh them out. Best of luck to whichever path you choose in your academic career. Side note I\u2019m starting in two weeks online and transferring to campus in summer.",

I understand it\u2019s a for profit school but holy crap that was mind blowing to me. \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude05\n\n*also thank you so much for the answer. It\u2019s actually incredibly helpful for how much others may need out there too. \ud83d\udc99",

If you are actually taking out funds, yes you do have to sign it. It\u2019s a loan, and that makes sense. FAFSA doesn\u2019t just push you to do counseling and the MPN unless you are actually using the loans.\n\nJust as an admissions requirement is not a normal thing, which is why I asked.",

They\u2019ll give you a break down of how much each semester of your program costs and if you\u2019ll have any extra that will need to be paid outside of the student loan. They\u2019ll also tell you about any scholarship opportunities. Full sail doesn\u2019t really give you a offer letter. They have a 100 percent acceptance rate, as long as you can pay for it you\u2019re in pretty much. I just started this month.",

I got a job in the casino game industry making slot games. I did apply to 300-400 jobs. There's a success rate of 18 % of getting an interview and an even lower success rate if you're an International student. But in the end it's a numbers game.",

It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, but on the other side of that it's has taught me fundamentals to such a level where when I understood the same concept but from a very unique perspective. I definitely recommend the program if you can keep up. I've spent mutiple sleepless nights at school for projects. I would recommend studying pre calculus and start learning some c++ before you start. But definitely best education I've ever received and it's worth the moeny. The only other thing is Accreditation, if you're planning to do a master's program eventually it's going to be hard because alot of universities do not recognise Full Sails a.ccreditation. You could always do a master's from another University with the same type of accreditation.",

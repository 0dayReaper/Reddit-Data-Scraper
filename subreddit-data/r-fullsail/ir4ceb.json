Everyone keeps saying it\u2019s expensive but when I look at the only college around me that has the degree I want, it would cost me 40k-60k more than if I got my bachelors at full sail. I also looked at out-of-state colleges like University of central Florida, and it would more than the one instate. I don\u2019t understand why people say it\u2019s expensive? If I\u2019m missing something then please tell me because I\u2019m considering going to full sail.",

Because I have to go for four year. I really don\u2019t see why people are saying it\u2019s really expensive. The cheapest 4 year college in my state is 20k a year so full sail is even cheaper than that.",

I\u2019m only on my first month, but, am looking forward to what\u2019s coming.  But, yeah comparatively, it not much more or less expensive.  I\u2019m doing Computer Animation, which, is something that no university in my state offers.  And if there was an option, it would still cost 60k+, by the end of my time at Full Sail, I will be lying less than that.",

I can certainly tell you that judging by the 1st class, you will be required to accomplish much more in the month than you may be expected to during a 3 month class at a normal scheduled school.  It may be too hard for some people.  But, I don\u2019t think so.  And a lot of normal scheduled schools are just places you go to squeak by to get your piece of paper.  You need to put in the time here, you will be wasting your time and money at Full Sail if your only goal is to get your degree.  You should always push to get the best grade possible, because you need to be learning what they\u2019re teaching you.",

But the main reason I want to go there is to learn the skills I need so that I can make a good portfolio and be able create good content. I know you can get jobs with just a good portfolio and no degree but to be honest I have no idea where to begin. That why I feel like full sail would be a good college. Also I\u2019m not very social so I have no trouble spending hours at my desk working on projects.",

Not saying you couldnt work in games with a comp anim degree just you have to learn more on ur own if you did ever want to do games. \nAs far as cost, its not as expensive as most 4 year private schools, but its still at least $50-80k which is nothing to scoff at even if other schools are $120-150k\n Its a great school, cheaper, faster, and more focused on actually making art than any 4 year school. I highly recommend.\nSource: am game art grad",

            "comment": " Hi! So when I started, Full Sails tuition was about $27-39,000 dollars for in-state students who live in (Florida) online or students who attend campus! Off-campus students (online) who live in a different state like myself, our tuition STARTED at $39,000 dollars. The $39,000 covered out-of-state tax, 2 different kinds of off-campus budgets and 1 book &amp; supplies fee. My total tuition was about $64,600 once they added my Launch box &amp; any institutional fees, and then you have to realize that full sails an accelerated program where you'll receive a 4 yr degree in 2 years so that's where my $64,600 dollar tuition came from. I'm sure tuition is different for everyone because not everyone's launch box is the same price, for example at the time with a gaming degree your tuition would be around 80k. There are students who cancel their launch box because they have decent equipment already and then you have students who can't afford the equipment so they cancel their launch box and Full sail Takes that charge away. NO, the launch box isn't required but Full Sail RECOMMENDS IT! We used everything in the Launch Box in almost every single class. Each semester was broken down into different payments so starting off it was about 6k-5k a semester and towards the end, I paid 3k- $900 dollars a semester, and then once you get to the END END of the program you'll pay about $45.00 dollars on the 1st of every month with NO INTEREST! According to when I started, I was told that you have a 10 yr grace period to pay back any loans that you have taken out once you graduate. I'm apart of the Digital Cinematography degree if that helps. As far as paying for my tuition starting off every semester FASFA gave me $5,600 and I was given a lot of Pell Grants, and then of course there's no way around the debt so I took out Direct Subsidized, and Unsubsidized loans, on top of a Parent Plus loan to cover my entire tuition. If you keep your grades up Full Sail MIGHT offer you a momentum scholarship. Also when you file your taxes you won't receive a refund but Full Sail will receive the refund and put it toward your tuition. It may be different in 2020, but this is how it worked for me! Hope this helps!",

            "comment": "When comparing tuition prices, it\u2019s important to remember that most public universities have different prices for in-state and out-of-state students. Out-of-state is always the more expensive of the two. Full Sail doesn\u2019t do different prices because it is a private university, meaning they don\u2019t receive funding from the state government - so it\u2019s the same price for out-of-state and in-state. For FL residents, UCF is much cheaper than FS (especially when you factor in state scholarships like Bright Futures).",

            "comment": "I\u2019m in my 5th month, art history and I would say it\u2019s worth it. Kind of fast paced but if you use you\u2019re time wisely you\u2019ll end up having a lot of free time. Classes are pretty easy so far and I already have a MacBook Pro (got after 4th month) and an iPad (got after month 1). The rest of the launch box comes at the end of scriptwriting which is month 9. \n\nI\u2019ve been to regular community college where you take 2,3 or more classes at once and it\u2019s nice to only have to focus on one class at a time and the schedule is super easy to remember. Discussion post, assignment and reply to post every week with a live session thrown in at the beginning of the week. All classes are different though, some have tests instead of assignments but are always open book and easy. I\u2019ve gotten all A\u2019s so far and I don\u2019t practice my time management as well as I should.\n\nI\u2019m also using my gi bill to pay for tuition so I\u2019m not paying anything out of pocket. If you\u2019re concerned with the cost, I\u2019d weigh the pros and cons and do more research into that. I think the total for the digital cinema bachelors is 71k which is pretty pricey but if you\u2019re serious about learning the trade than I\u2019d definitely consider talking to the enrollment team and they can help you out with FAFSA and scholarships so you\u2019ll pay a lot less than the full tuition price. Good luck and let me know if you have any more questions.",

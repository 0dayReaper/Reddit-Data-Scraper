My first two years of college was a mix of theater, music, and physics classes (it's a long story). Now that I'm starting to get away from that, I'm leaning on going in for an English degree to learn how to tell beautiful stories and evoke emotion from an audience. I'm also working on getting a CS minor with the English major.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI figure full sail will accept me, however I'm wondering if it would be better to transfer there now instead of finishing my english major/CS minor tract or instead going there for my masters in their game design master's degree.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso doing an online stackskills course to learn more about programming \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think that having an English degree to learn how to tell a good story (I have ADHD so often times my stories don't follow) would be beneficial, however if that's something that's taught in Full Sail well enough, then I rather just transfer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?",

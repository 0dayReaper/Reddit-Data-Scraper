There is nothing more annoying than being in a workshop/lecture and having someone be like \u201chold up, you wanted us to use ALL of them?\u201d I imagine the digital cinematography program is very similar.",

I graduate in August and currently have a 3.9 GPA, and I'm more than happy to connect with fellow students and alumni.",

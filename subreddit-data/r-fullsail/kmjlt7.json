Free education for life, amirite? \n\nBut then they claim the course changed a lot, and they don't want to give new information out that freely... Etc. But they definitely should work on that.\n\nIf my degree wasn't so hands on (show pro), I'd definitely try and take that offer up online.",

Granted I didn't need any additional hardware or software for the courses that was auditing. That might affect what you can and cannot do. This is for game design, so YMMV.",

Once I figured it out, they asked me a few questions about what I wanted to audit (degree, course code, online/campus, etc). They take a few days to verify that you actually can audit the class, and then you get enrolled as an student for a month.\n\nUPDATE: I called  855-374-3572 and asked about an audit. I received an email from studentsupport \\[at\\] [fullsail.com](https://fullsail.com). They sent me back a form to fill out. Looks like I may have called them back up to finish the process.",

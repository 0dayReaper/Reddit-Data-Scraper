Only the proctor uses them, but mostly it will be a screen share.\n\nFor most classes, you won't be required to attend live, but you will gain more out of your time at FSU if you do attend them live.\n\nIt gives you a chance to interact directly with your Proctor and your classmates. Giving and getting real-time feedback as you go is essential, especially in an online environment. It's easy to lose pace and fall behind otherwise.",

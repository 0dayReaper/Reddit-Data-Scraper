    "postText": "Does Full Sail offer Associate degrees? I was looking to apply for a Bachelors in Graphic Design, but you need to have an associates in a similar field. \n\nThere was also this \u201cRequirements for Admissions\u201d pdf that appeared in the Full Sail google search stating that in order to apply for a Bachelors of Science Degree Program, you either have to have an associates or high level degree from an accredited school related to the degree. The other option was to have \u201cA Full Sail Associate or Bachelor of Science Degree with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0\u201d.\n\nThis pdf is from 2014, but shows up in the search results as if it\u2019s the present terms. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s changed.",

For what it's worth, if you already have the associates you could probably transfer most of those credits over to fullsail, but I went to fullsail pretty much straight from highschool into the Simulation and visualization degree, it was tough but I am having a good time going through it.",

I took a year off doing some small stuff to figure out what the hecc I wanted to do, tried a bunch of different classes at a community College near my parents house (pretty much signed up for a lot, quite a lot right after I realize I did not like them as classes), and ended up with fullsail since I wanted to do simulation and visualization. I had my Act score, which helped place me a bit ahead with my math classes, as well as taking some of there preliminary tests for math and English and such as well.\n\nPretty much if you have a good convo with the admissions counselor you'll get a really God idea of what the heck to do. My first real conversation with fullsail was with an admissions counselor called Paul Mylod, really great guy, helped me understand what I was really getting into with fullsail and what I would need to do to prepare. My best advice, call them and talk to them, you'll get Hella good info from it.",

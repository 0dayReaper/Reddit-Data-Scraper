            "comment": "No one is going to be able to tell you which exact model you'll receive.\n\nFull Sail has a contract with each of their equipment providers, the school receives a certain number of each item based on predicted enrollment numbers. How frequently they get shipments is the primary determination of the model is.\n\nAre you going to receive a laptop that the school received 12 months ago, 6 months ago, or last week? None of us can tell you that. But there is a very good chance that your laptop and iPad will be either the current generation or the one prior.\n\nIt also depends on your degree program. Game design and I believe a couple other programs don't receive MacBooks, they get laptops running Windows. For a time, the film students got MacBooks with larger screens than the creative writing students.\n\nIf you're starting at the end of this month, you won't receive your MacBook until next year (around month 5 of your program), and it's impossible for anyone here to know which MacBooks will be in stock at the school's shipping center at that time.",

Two months before I was set to receive mine, the school's contract with Sony was updated, all the unused FS5 units were shipped back to Sony and the school received FX6 units for students.\n\nSo all the students in my class received FX6 cameras, a big upgrade from the FS5 we were expecting.\n\nAll that is to say that things can change quickly, but in general you're going to get the up-to-date models of any equipment.\n\nEdit: DM me and we can stay in touch through the Digital Cine program. I'm happy to offer and advice/help I can!",

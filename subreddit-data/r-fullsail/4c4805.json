    "postText": "I, along with others, am having problems with deciding where to look for housing. I have talked to a couple of people who seem to be good roommates, but none of us are sure which places to look at.  There are places that look really nice, but are extremely expensive. There are places that are super cheap in comparison, but aren't rated that high. So, I guess I'm asking past and current students of full sail which places they recommend?",

Before that I shared a 1 bedroom shit holy as Casselberry something I forgot but it's across the street from publics. Those places suck but you can get a place for 400ish bucks.\n\nMy girlfriend lives at Sun Key. I liked it there, never had an issue but those places are pricey as shit. ",

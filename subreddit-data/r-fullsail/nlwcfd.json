(I'm just saying you're using the same patterns of speech and words the last person that posted like this did)\n\nI'm not sure about a toxic community. This kind of posting is the definition of toxic. I'm sorry you had a bad experience, but people disagreeing with someone is not bullying just as you're disagreeing with most people here.  If you experience actual bullying, then you can report it and it will be reviewed. \n\nAt the least, you don't have to participate in any capacity if your views don't align with the community.",

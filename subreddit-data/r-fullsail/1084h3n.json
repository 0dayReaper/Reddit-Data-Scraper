Doing supplemental work and researching, as well as networking. School is just a build a foundation. You have to make yourself desirable.",

Data Structures and algorithms and Software engineering (learn design patterns and best OOP practices). Pay attention I\u2019m those two classes you\u2019ll be prepared for those interview. The rest of the classes really just brushes over small parts of the industry to give you depth and really an idea of what field you may want to do after college. They teach you mobile dev, systems, data science , networking . You also have classes to work on projects. The big ones are midterm project and then a finals project. There\u2019s also another smaller one that last two months . But you get to build a decent portfolio of software (mostly your choice ) to show to future employers as well. But again. No future employer will care what school you went to. Just that you know your sh*t. All of what you learn at full sail can be learned online. But you won\u2019t have a safety net of instructors or lab instructors to help you when you get stuck. As well as a true structured path from knowing nothing to bring industry ready.",

I shouldn\u2019t have told them I had one because they wouldn\u2019t have found out I\u2019m sure but now I\u2019m stuck",

I can't say if they'll reject you or not, but I highly doubt it- I think as long as they get their money you're probably fine. But I'd hate to have you waste it.   \n\n\nIf I were you, I'd talk to someone at Full Sail about it, just be honest. \"Look, this is what's going to come up, am I wasting my time?\" From what I found, the admissions people were really helpful.",

I will say though that they (I talked to 2 separate people) both basically said that that\u2019s how they understand it but couldn\u2019t say for sure.",

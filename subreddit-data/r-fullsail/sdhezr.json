Cramming a concept for 8 hours a day 1 month and then never touching it is why so many full sail grads come out knowing just about as much as they went in with. Going to a traditional college and than full sail was a night and day experience. \n\nThe 1 month 2 class schedule also means you don\u2019t even get a good curriculum for that limited time. The amount of times I asked questions and was told \u201cwe really should cover that but we don\u2019t have time on this fast schedule\u201d or \u201cI would show you the correct way to do this but we don\u2019t have time\u201d is amazing.

If you have tens of thousands of graduates cycling through your program, the odds that dozens or even hundreds go on to succeed in their field is guaranteed.\n\nBut what you ignore is the 59,000/60000 that never even touched game dev despite doing the game dev or design program. We focus on the 1,000 that made it. Survivorship bias.\n\nThat's how these for-profit mills get you, you see the same thing in these bootcamp scams, on most of their front pages is \"Our graduates work at microsoft, google, bing, etc\".

There is a reason the school has 28% graduation rate despite being cheaper or on par to most out of state tuition while also not having a challenging curriculum and a quicker grad time. There is a reason why full sail\u2019s loan default rate is 50% higher than the National average for graduates. \n\nDon\u2019t even get me started on online where you can just google and cheat the entire course and get a degree without ever doing work yourself. 90% of the material are online because all they do is reuse content so you just copy paste and get degree. They have no browser check or monitoring. That\u2019s not good practices for a good school. Even the final exams have no monitoring or checks, I can cheat a 100% on an exam worth 30% of my grade\u2026..what?? It\u2019s not even hard to have proctored online exams, third parties will do it for you just buy a license..\n\nAh and the accreditation. The school is so legit only other degree mills will take a credit from them\u2026.because actual schools know the courses they are teaching do not have the depth had it been taken else where. Your recording arts example might just be an outlier because I will concede that is one major that is poorly represented outside of for profit schools. It\u2019s typically a self taught or mentor taught field so in that specific example I can see this school helping because it was originally JUST a recording arts studio.\n\nHowever, comparing their tech, writing, games, etc majors to traditional colleges is just a joke. So are the general classes like calc and physics. Physics is actually a great example of a course that suffers tremendously from a 1 month schedule. I would offer a FS student 1,000 if they could pass a physics exam 3 months after that class. The formulas and equations you need will be long gone by then in the majority of students. 1 month of cramming and never using it again is antithetical to memory especially in a memory based course such as sciences where the entire course is memorizing patterns, rules and equations.",

There is no metric where full sail compares that you can say it\u2019s a good school. Their graduation rate, student loan default rate, graduate average salary, accreditation, graduate ratings, acceptance rate : fail ratio, etc, etc, etc are all subpar to traditional colleges averages. Every single record you would use to determine a schools worth, they are under par for.\n\nYour measure of it\u2019s a good school is anecdotal evidence of \u201cit worked for me\u201d. That\u2019s exactly what my statement means, your sold on the dream. Has nothing to do with AAA studios or projects. All that means is that because you are sold, you are willing to ignore every metric that is used to determine if a school is good because of anecdotes.\n\nIt\u2019s not an opinion when they flunk out on every metric possible. That\u2019s like saying a 1.2 gpa is an opinion. It\u2019s a numeric measurement assigned to performance.\n\nAnecdotes can\u2019t measure school performance. Like I said survivorship bias. If you take anyone with a pulse, the odds are at least some of them will have good anecdotes from the experience. That\u2019s just brute forcing probability. That\u2019s not a performance metric.",

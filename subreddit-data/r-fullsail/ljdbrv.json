    "postText": "I am a Full Sail University master's student graduate in Digital Marketing. I am (was) interested in doing the Business Intelligence masters through the university because I thought that my last program was quit rewarding (I immediately got a promotion and raise within the first month of graduation, but I have been at my company for years and don't know that I would have gotten in the door solely based on my credentials or experience at Full Sail).  I am sad that I will not be able to more forward with my BI degree. Today I did the online open house just so that I could get an overview of the BI program and double check that it's what I want. \n\nYou have to sit through about an hour of chatter to get to the breakout session, they interviewed alumni and when they were done, one of the hosts passed out compliments to the established alumni and the female game developer was called \"precious\" rather than given a compliment based on her abilities or success. My blood boils. Was she just there as a token female in tech?",

    "postText": "Hey, guys! I'm looking for some pals who are also going to Full Sail! Not networking, just making casual friends. :)\n\nA bit about me:  \nI'm Riven. I'm a 27 year old returning student for Creative Writing, starting November 22nd. I'm non-binary (they/them) and I'm a parent with two kiddos. I'm into-- you guessed it-- writing! As well as anime, horror movies/shows/books, spooky things (I'm goth), Victorian-era everything, animals, baking, coffee, Lord of the Rings, fantasy themes, etc. I draw, too! I used to draw professionally but my arm issues have given me no choice but to drop that. :')\n\nWanna be friends? Tell me about yourselves! &lt;3",

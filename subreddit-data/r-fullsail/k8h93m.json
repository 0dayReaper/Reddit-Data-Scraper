    "postText": "Hey all. I\u2019ve been at full sail in the Digital Cinematography program for  11 months and my anxiety of getting in front of the camera is becoming an issue. I thought I would be able to practice and outgrow but no dice. I do have some experience in Python programming and beginning to look into Xcode since I got the launch box Mac. How easy would it be to call full sail and ask if I can do that? Is it even possible? And does anyone know if I need to return the launch box I already received? If I don\u2019t get any answers by the time I call fullsail in a few hours I\u2019ll post how it went in case anyone was curious. Thanks!",

But I've asked a lot of questions about it simply because I'm 'that guy' I guess. You'd keep your launch box, they don't want it back and have no use for any of the items. They'd extend the offer to provide what you'd need for game design, or you can opt-out if the setup you currently have will suffice. \n\nThe only thing I can think of that's a big negative here is being 11 months into a program, so that's 11 months of tuition paid for a very expensive school. Thankfully I doubt you'd have to do the 'core four' classes again, but still.. If money isn't an issue, then follow your heart my friend and good luck.",

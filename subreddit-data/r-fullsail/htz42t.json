There were a few poor professors and the class schedules from month to month often didn\u2019t build on one another, but I have to put the blame on myself for not going above and beyond outside the classroom. It\u2019s definitely a school that you get out of it what you put into it.",

            "comment": "Lol at the wasting money thing twice, but I get why you'd say that.\n\nAll right, so a few things first, I'm speaking from the point of view of someone who has wanted to attend Fullsail since 2005ish and graduated (this Feb) for my Bachelor's in Videogame Design. I've wanted to do game design since I was 7 years old, before I even knew the word for it existed.\n\nYou ultimately get out what you put in. There were some instructors that I expected to be a bit more professional but I suffered and no longer have to deal with them anymore. Not going to lie, I barely passed, but I did it, struggling and all and to be honest, every rough day on campus was entirely worth it. Every hard assed instructor I had to put up with, also worth it.\n\nMy reasoning, I tried to study this stuff on my own after graduating high school in 2006. I literally was going nowhere fast, I had and still have more passion to make games people want to see in my pinky finger than some developers have at companies right now in their entire body and I still couldn't get anywhere with all that passion, it was too hard, took too long and I just didn't have enough to get started.\n\nMy Mom unfortunately passed back in 2013 from a massive heart attack while I was deployed in the Navy before I attended and never got to see me start in 2017, but I promised her I'd do it, that I would go and graduate for it.\nI managed to graduate right before covid hit, and it still delayed getting my degree mailed to me. I emailed Fullsail and of all the days, guess what day I get it on?\n\nMother's day.\n\nFullsail can be a waste, instructors can just go there and collect a paycheck from my G.I. Bill without ever really knowing me as an individual but damnit, it was worth it to me so the answer to your question is this:\n\nIt depends. Take it or leave it, your future is in YOUR hands, you're the driver and if life throws you a curve, pull the handbrake and drift around that sonifabish.\n\ud83e\udd18",

My problem was not knowing a lot of basics in art but I loved animation and had been making stuff in Macromedia Flash(to all my OG SFDT and Newgrounds fans and artists) and Blender(I found Maya to be a nightmare to learn, actually had an alumni from Full Sail tell me to do all the projects in blender then save them in maya before submission )",

Full Sail is exactly the same way.\n\nYou need to really put in the effort and make sure you are doing MORE than what is required as classwork. Finding success from Full Sail does not come in the form of a degree. It\u2019s what you learn to create while you are there. That\u2019s why you hear so much about Portfolios. Don\u2019t think you can get a degree at Full Sail and suddenly all your dreams will come true. Your degree does not show your work, your portfolio does. Build your portfolio while you are in school.\n\nAs long as you can keep these things in mind, you can succeed at Full Sail. Don\u2019t be one of the many students that think all they need to do is pass the classes.",

While Full Sail does try to help you develop a portfolio while you're there, in the end it's up to you to make it career-ready.",

That being said,  if you just want to get learn, get a meaningful degree and get out then Full Sail isn\u2019t the place. You can go to a cheaper school or teach yourself and get the same result. I\u2019ve found and heard a lot of places don\u2019t take Full Sail degrees seriously and the end goal comes down to just marketing yourself and making those connections as early and fast as possible. \n\nWhen I applied they were very pushy. Looking back on it the application process felt like a car dealer trying the hardest to make sale. They would say everything they needed to in order to get me to agree to move forward, slap me on enrollment by the following month class schedule and start milking my funding.\n\nIf I could do time over again I would have taught myself and use the internet and the city to promote my work.",

(Most schools are REGIONALLY accredited which is what you really want.)  Which, if you think \"I wouldn't transfer anyway\" then I guess go for it. But if you ever wanted to transfer  (or get a higher degree like an MFA in filmmaking) then you would basically have to start from scratch.",

            "comment": "I went for about a year for the online program in graphic design. I knew I enjoyed design, but I didn\u2019t have a complete passion for it either. I did really well, kept a 3.9 GPA, and had mostly great instructors, but I lost the passion in it after a certain point. I took a month off to get my motivation back, but it didn\u2019t work so I took another month off. After the second month knowing i still didn\u2019t want to go back, I knew I was done with full sail. It costs way too much money and I can\u2019t finish a degree with a school and end up with all this debt when I doubt I will do anything with it when I graduate. It was fun for a while, and I\u2019m happy to have the proper equipment for the future, but it\u2019s a lot of money for something you don\u2019t plan on doing full time when you\u2019re done, or don\u2019t have the motivation to put yourself out there and network during that time.",

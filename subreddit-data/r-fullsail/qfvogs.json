If anything happens to the computer or other technology they supply you, it's up to you to get it fixed and your grade is at risk. Some instructors won't allow extensions, especially on your final week. Do every assignment that is graded, even if it's 1% weighted. Read everything carefully to fully understand your assignments. The Discord for certain classes will help you connect with fellow students and possibly get you quick answers to questions.",

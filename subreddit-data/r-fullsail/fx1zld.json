And I understand that the advisor I spoke to over the phone has incentives to get me to go there so information will be biased. \n\n\nI'd love to have a actual phone conversation or discord, Skype, hangout, whatever with someone who is currently enrolled in the program so I can get a better idea of what I'm getting myself into. \n\n\nIs there anyone on here that would be willing to converse with me?",

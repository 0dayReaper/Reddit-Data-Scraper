    "postText": "Hey,\n\nI wanted to connect with those here who are looking to build a portfolio project. I am making a game along with other mature hobbyists and it's going quite well but we are looking for some more people to round-out the team.\n\nIt's a really cute wholesome game where you gather really cute jelly-like creatures\uff08\uff3e\u03c9\uff3e\uff09and work with them to craft a sky island paradise.\n\n[Feed cute creatures &gt;&gt;](https://i.imgur.com/RlY5vwN.png)\n\nIt's a simple single player game, but it is 3D.\n\nI am so proud of our little team and all the progress we are making on a daily basis. However, we have about 7 active programmers but few artists, project managers, animators and designers.\n\nWe have been going for over a year now and hope to get it out there asap. We have been working hard on getting a 2nd prototype out the door asap. We get through about 5 issues daily on via Git.\n\nReally important to us is a culture of positive and friendly cooperation. In our group you'll find a friendly, wholesome and mature community of people who hate toxicity and love creatively getting stuff done together.\n\nIt's all about passion and creativity.\n\nNote: We meet daily on Discord and work together in live chat. We help each other solve problems and brainstorm solutions together. If someone needs help, they unmute, see who is unmuted and ask and get help right away. People who are busy go mute/deaf or low volume and just plug-in to work. It's a really helpful and friendly atmosphere but that's not for everyone and you don't have to work that way if you join us.\n\nComment if you want to join or ask questions!",

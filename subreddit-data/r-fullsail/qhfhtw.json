    "postText": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m in Show Production month 3 and I started working at Church In The Son, an 1,800 seat church about 15-30 minutes away from school. We are always searching for volunteers to help run the production. We are especially looking for people to operate our 5 camera positions: 2 tripods, handheld wired, gib, and if you\u2019re good you can use my handheld wireless rig.\n\nOn special occasions like tonight when people call out we also look to fill positions like lighting, FOH, monitors, switcher, IMAG switcher, broadcast mix, Resolume, and ProPresenter. We have a large auditorium and a small 300 seat auditorium which have services at the same time so we need two production teams any given service.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested reach out to me: 518-772-8125\n\nWe have 3 services each week: Sunday 9, 11am and Wednesday 7pm",

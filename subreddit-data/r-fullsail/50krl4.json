I was looking into get my Master's in Game Design at Full Sail and I'm looking for some real people's experiences in the program. If you'd recommend it or if you'd recommend skipping the masters and going straight into the industry with a bachelor's. ",

                    "comment": "Would you be able to elaborate on your experience at Full Sail pursing the GDMS? Would you recommend it? I have been hearing some negative things about Full Sail in general(i.e just wanting your money, being a waste of time, not being respected), but I am very curious about this degree specifically.  \n\nI really want to get into the game industry and Full Sail is just very convenient for me.  I live right next to campus, I can start this month as opposed to having to wait till Fall of next year if I wanted to go to another grad school for Game Design, and I can be finished with the program in one year.  I can definitely see that other grad schools can provide a better learning experience than Full Sail, but Full Sail might just be the best fit for me at this current time.  So if the GDMS is worth it, I'd definitely be interested.\n\nThanks! ",

This also ties in with the whole 'not being respected' comment - Full Sail as far as I'm aware is not held in high standards by other educational facilities around the US. **BUT** it has a wide array of networking across the industries that Full Sail teaches in, and in that particular area Full Sail has credit. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRegarding the GDMS course specifically, I will say right away that it is *not* aptly named. There is really only one Game Design class in the program. Instead, you mostly taught: how to be a manager and a leader; the basics of how to produce games (resource management, the production pipeline etc); the User Experience (playtesting, quality assurance, human-computer interaction). Realistically, as I said in my other comment, this course preps you for a lead position by providing you with the necessary education in managing within the game industry. My design skills have been honed and practiced in the GDMS' version of a thesis, the 'Capstone'. \n\nThe capstone is a 8-month long project that will take up most of your time during the week in various areas: \n* User Experience (interning at the illustrious User Experience Lab on-campus - very scientific and has a high hiring rate. Does not really get you involved in the game development process at all though, it's all about testing and making reports on tests). \n\n* Serious Games (not terribly well managed studio that does actually provide you with the ability to develop games in the capacity you desire - this studio is only as good as you and your peers make it though. I left it with a friend when the faculty member that was 'running' the studio and other externs were exerting stupid management decisions on us and provided us with zero guidance or help. After leaving, some others in the studio actually turned things around, and now they are producing games again.)\n\n* Indie Games (Heavily managed by a faculty member. Will be developing games for his studio and IP, so you won't have much creative control but it would more akin to a real-life studio.)\n\n* Production Track (you will manage other bachelor student teams and help facilitate the production of their games, typically for their final projects. Very well managed by a faculty member who has the most industry experience, but you will likely not be developing any games.)\n\n* Other (literally up to you, but you will have to pitch to faculty and get it approved. Examples are students forming their own studio, students working in the prestigious VR lab, actually working for real in the industry but answering to your advisors, and others.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUltimately, Full Sail provides you with a conducive learning experience but you get out what you make from it. I kinda rambled here but if you have any more questions I'd be happy to answer.",

Having a Master's in general will make you eligible for a lead position, but the 8 months work experience you'd get at full sail in a production role might tip the balance in your favour.",

If not, you might struggle to complete this course - they pretty strongly advise to not do their course AND have a part-time job. I found myself devoting 30-40 hour weeks to work for the course, so I definitely wouldn't have wanted to work on top of that. \n\nI basically only had the weekends free.\n\nThe first four months you only have class three times a week, for 4 hours apiece.

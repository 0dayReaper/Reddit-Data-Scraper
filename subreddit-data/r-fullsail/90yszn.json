They said they still don\u2019t know if they 2018 model will work with Full Sail\u2019s software. They said it can take 6 to 8 months before they finish testing it for release. It\u2019s just the same MBP with a faster processor. I don\u2019t see why it takes 6 to 8 months to realize it will work Adobe software. The same software already works with desktops with 12 core or more processors.\n\n[edit] \nI will come back to update this with what I receive when FedEx shows up later today.",

So it\u2019s past the 30 day window to return it. I started my first class on May 28th and I had some credits transferred over. So that is why I am getting mine after my second class. When I searched the serial number it was purchased on May 29th 2018. I assume they purchase the MBP\u2019s after the first day of class.",

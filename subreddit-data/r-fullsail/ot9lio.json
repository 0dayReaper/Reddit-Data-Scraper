As far as the rest of these comments are concerned, fullsail is not by any means a more expensive college compared to other colleges of its caliber, especially considering other colleges require students to stay in dorms for freshman/sophomore years and they charge for dorms and other expenses. Worst case scenario, put off school for a while, save, and come back in full force without worrying about it as much. \n\nAsk your academic advisor for options, if you need to you can take a month or two pause from fullsail in order to collect some money from work to get some saved time, and if needed you can potentially move in with a roommate/get a roommate in order to cut down on your costs.\n\nI",

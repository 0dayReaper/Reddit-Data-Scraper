    "postText": "Hello! I'm a prospective student and I had two question if y'all could help me. I am a HOH(hard of hearing)/deaf student and I was wondering what that community looked like at Fullsail. I need a lot of help with classes and just in general life. I already talked with the admissions counselor, and I wanted to get the student perspective. I am also a Christian believer. I am not a preacher and I don't ever want to force my beliefs on anyone, but there are certain beliefs and actions I will not participate in. Are professors accommodating and is there an Christian community at Fullsail? Thank you!",

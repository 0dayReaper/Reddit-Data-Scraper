One of the recruiters I talked to over the phone said it\u2019s a lot like vocational school, which I\u2019ve never been. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",

I highly recommend you join a club or two in the first few months to get outside perspectives in other programs, especially in the field you intend to go into. (Armada hosts monthly get together for instance where a lot of different program students meet). I do recommend that you start to put together a resume and visit career development as soon as you can because writer jobs are very difficult to nail if you don\u2019t have connections (hence why I recommend going to CD, as they have a lot of good resources and mixer events).",

You'd get a similar experience going to a community college and getting an english degree and at the very least with that you have options you could fall back on plus you'd have significantly less debt. \nFor reference their writing program is in my opinion utter garbage and most of what they teach can be self taught.",

It wasn\u2019t easy, and he told me he wouldn\u2019t recommend going self-taught, but it can still be done. \n\n@OP - I\u2019m not in this program, but if it\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in, I\u2019d definitely research into other colleges as well as research more into Full Sail. I have a buddy in creative writing, he enjoys it.",

I don\u2019t know enough about the said degree to get into the technicals of it, but I\u2019m sure it can be achieved at an overall cheaper cost by going to community.. \n\nHowever, if you\u2019re going for a bachelors English degree it\u2019ll take 4 years at a community. Let\u2019s say for those 4 years you spend $15-$20k for classes at the community college. But at Full Sail, you\u2019re spending $60-$70k (estimate - I\u2019m too lazy to find the actual cost) to get your degree in 2 1/2 (roughly) years. If you\u2019re making $50k/yr (I don\u2019t know salary estimates for creative writing) after college, that\u2019s $75k over that year and a half you saved by going to Full Sail instead of the community college, which is enough to pay off debt. (Obviously this is an equation that doesn\u2019t include personal expenses or anything like that). It just depends on the scenario.",

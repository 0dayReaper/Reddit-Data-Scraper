Does anyone have any experience in these degrees and doesnt mind shedding some light into success rates, instruction style and benefits of one over the other? Any information at all would be amazing. Thanks!",

            "comment": "That's not true at all. They teach mostly c#, c++ and a little bit of Python. The teachers are very involved once you get into you concentration classes. In fact they encourage you to stop by the AR/VR Lab after you've learned enough c# to defend yourself so they can make an easier task of showing you the more complicated vector math programming they'll teach you in their courses. The Sim viz teachers are literally the best teachers I've ever had and they were a massive help in every step of the way. ",

You get most of the I'm class knowledge that software developer gets + you get to learn to use rapid prototyping tools like 3D printers, laser cutters and other things. On top of all this you get your hands on commercial grade simulation equipment like the MOOG platform, which is really good preparation if you want to go into the military stimulation or entertainment simulation fields.",

I just hear rumor of teachers just giving you online subscriptions to websites and basically pay for something you could do online for free, but what you said eases my mind quite a bit. Do you know what programming languages they teach I want to stay ahead of the curve. ",

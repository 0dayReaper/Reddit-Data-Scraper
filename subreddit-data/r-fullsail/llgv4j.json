    "postText": "Currently there's a few different macbook pros and I'm curious, will it be a 13\" or 16\"? Will it be an intel or M1 based model? What kind of graphics does it have?\n\nI want to know what to expect to make sure i get the proper accessories planned\n\nEdit: I'm surprised to hear that it might be the 16\" and that's good news, It'll be so much easier to see what im doing in premiere.\n\nI also hope that it'll be the M1 version due to the things I've heard about the Intel based model, also I'm in digital cinematography if that matters!",

I'm wondering if this has to do with the chip shortage?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo those who have gotten their either Macbook pros or MSIs please tell me what you got!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsorry I am commenting on here asking this vs my own Reddit...I feel everyone here would have advice for others who might find this when looking to figure out what they're getting :3",

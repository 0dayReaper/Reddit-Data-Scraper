    "postText": " \n\n# \n\n***Then:***  \nSo when I started last year as an online student I went searching for every place Students gather online. Since the world was reduced to remote everything at that point I figured the student body would have a pretty large online presence. I was very mistaken. So I started creating a discord server of my own. I quickly abandoned it since I found there are servers set up for different programs.\n\n***Now:***  \nAfter attending for a year I have found the currently available offerings to be inadequate or unsatisfactory. My main goal is to create a place where potential students, attending students, alum, or even staff if they choose can come together and do exactly what they push us to do so hard to do and interact, or \"network\". But beyond that, there are many classes or times where there is no place to get help from your peers. Especially online. I'm talking about outside of the Co-Pilot stuff. In a sense what I'm talking about is a general Full Sail community discord.\n\n**Why:**  \nNow the reason for this post. I want to get some opinions on what types of channels people may like from that type of server. As it is in my head at the moment it's fairly basic and would suit me just fine. However this is not just for me, this is intended for everyone. This is intended to be a general place we can all come together to be social, share work, or help each other. There is no reason the student body should be so fractured, future, past or present.\n\nAn example of my thoughts is this: A film student can likely not help an Animation Student with UV's. However he may be able to help them with PowerPoint, or something less program-specific. Also, a Film student and a Computer Animation student should be able to talk and learn from each other as there is a lot of overlap between the two. Especially when you get into post or direction. As well as Game art, and so on.\n\nSo, leave a comment below with some ideas if you feel like contributing. It will be a few days before I have something set up. I need time to come up with a list of rules and so on to ensure that this absolutely does not become a toxic environment, and is a place conducive to learning and prosperity. After all, this is still the internet.\n\nI'll update this post with the invite link as soon as it's up. Thanks to anyone ahead of time who contributes suggestions below. As I likely will not be able to respond if there is a lot of interest. Also not assuming there will be, just better safe than sorry.\n\nIf you read this far thanks for that too. Lol.",

From everything I understand between what staff has said, and I have been able to find by going through all the school's social media and related materials there is not an \"Offical Full Sail Discord\".  \n\n\nIf there's an official one, someone is not doing their job. I mean at all.",

Ultimately, it\u2019s tough and FS is designed to weed out students hoping to cruise through the program. There will be late nights and busy weekends, and you won\u2019t always love it. FS carries a reputation for a reason and it\u2019s not a surprise you find so many grads working on your favorite games and movies. After graduating the career center works hard to stay in contact and keep sending you job listings, I get one email every or every other week, and as soon as new listings are posted (I also have stricter requirements on mine for job and location, otherwise it would be more frequent). It\u2019s tough but definitely worth the effort and investment.",

Today everything came back approved ready to go. Monday I just have to do some advising and finally sign the loans etc.\nQuestions:\n1) What was your level of knowledge before starting and did FS leave your ready as a dev? Meaning you have the theory pretty much down just have to Google it if it\u2019s in a different language that you might not know etc. I hope this makes a little sense lol\n\n2) What were your 3 favorite classes or concepts or 3 things you thought were your favorite of FS. \n\n3) Game Engine, is that something your learned to write? Doesn\u2019t have to be the most advanced in the world but at least you can make a basic one?\n\n4) When it comes to AI, what kind of AI stuff is taught? I know it may be super broad but anything u can share.\n\nThat\u2019s what I have for now. I\u2019m asking because I\u2019m truly curious to hear your experience with the University and how you evolved as a student to dev.  Thanks a mill again! I\u2019ll definitely update as I progress through my courses.",

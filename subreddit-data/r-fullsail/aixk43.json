You will probably have one or two classes a month, and those classes have their own separate web pages that have links to assignments for you to work on, they can range from reading assignments, to essays, and tests. When I was an online student there wasn\u2019t any strict schedule for me to follow, usually they would unlock the assignments for the week and as long as I finished them on time it was all good. There was usually one class a week that would take place on goto meeting, but they recorded those so you didn\u2019t need to be there. \n\nOverall online wasn\u2019t too bad, just stay focused and get your assignments in on time!\n\nP.S. Not sure about he IPad thing, but FYI, I got my iPad only a few month before I was supposed to graduate and we didn\u2019t even need to use it once. Not sure why they made me buy it in the first place. ",

However I got my iPad pretty early, I think it was after my second or third class was completed, so at the beginning of my third month.  Then my computer came during my seventh class, roughly 5 and a half months after I started.  Also, the iPad I got was a 6th gen I think.",

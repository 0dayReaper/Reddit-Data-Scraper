    "postText": "Hey everyone! I\u2019ve seen mixed reviews about Full Sail. I\u2019m starting April (online), the college has let me transfer one credit (English Comp) from my High School dual credit classes. After scholarships, I\u2019m having to take out roughly $60k in loans. So far, everyone has been great throughout the orientation / signup process. \n\nI ended High School with a 3.67 GPA. I\u2019m a very fast learner when it\u2019s something I\u2019m interested about, which is why I think the fast pacing of Full Sail would be great for me. \n\nI was just wondering a few things..\n\n1) How many \u201cbasic\u201d classes can I be expecting to take?\n\n2) I was told I was getting the launch box after one month of classes (does that include the laptop? If not, when can I be expecting to receive the laptop?) What are the current specs?\n\n3) I\u2019ve heard that there was a fairly extensive workload (which I\u2019m 100% okay with), will I be able to have a part-time job while attending Full Sail?\n\n4) Will I be able to be a part of the eSports program since I\u2019m an online student? I play Smite very competitively (3k+ hours, have been playing since I was 12, I\u2019m currently 18) and I saw that Full Sail had a team. I\u2019m assuming they do LAN tournaments, so probably not, but just curious.\n\n5) How are the group-projects like for online students? \n\n6) Any tips from grads / current students are greatly appreciated :)",

Also as I believe yours will be the same as mine a iPad, backpack, and a MSI Raider laptop with a RTX 3080ti. But when you call ask about the specs for your degree.\n\n3. Not sure on this one. I start Monday as well but I\u2019ll be in Computer Science degree path. However, if you opted for the 20 month plan it will be harder to work with than the 29 month one.\n\n4. I\u2019m pretty sure you have to live within 15 miles of campus to qualify for esports. Ask once you call.\n\n5. No idea sorry.\n\n6. Not a grad student but I\u2019ve heard from my cousin that you get what you put in. A lot of people coast and only get the paper. But if you work hard and build a great portfolio then everything will workout for you.\n\nHope some of this helps!",

I\u2019ve reached out to their eSports team, because of Covid, they\u2019ve developed some online eSports teams and I\u2019ve reached out about applying, looks like I\u2019ll be able to once I\u2019m 4 months into the degree :)\n\nI\u2019ll be asking for my degree breakdown as soon as I get home, I appreciate the tips !",

Regardless of attendance policy, every class will have their lectures uploaded online afterwards. \nSome classes will have 1-2 assignments a week, and others will have like 3-4. \n\nIt really depends, but usually the classes that directly involve your degree are the most time consuming.",

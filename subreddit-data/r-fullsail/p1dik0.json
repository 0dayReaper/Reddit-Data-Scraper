I just started the game design program a week ago, and I'm also doing it just to help with my ability to do my own thing (regardless of potential failure). I'm not great with math and don't really know any programming- I want to learn it but I don't want to spend $20,000 on learning it. So I'm doing the Game Design Full Sail online program, and I'm supplementing it with doing free beginner programming &amp; math classes online (I'm doing C++ right now).",

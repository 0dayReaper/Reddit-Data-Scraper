    "postText": "Hello!\n\n I am almost finished with the admissions process (looking at May 1 start date) but I have a couple of questions. First of all, for those of us receiving Macbooks, should we be expecting the new 2023 M2, or the 2021 M1? I understand that is something months away for me, but I'm curious nonetheless :) \n\n Second, I saw someone say the Ipads will no longer be provided as of May. Can anyone validate that information? I was looking forward to being able to go between that and the mac for seamless note-taking and class on the go. I suppose I can go buy one if I have to, but I was definitely looking forward to not having to purchase it outright.\n\nThanks in advance! Side note- I will be in the Creative Writing BFA program if anyone would like to let me know what I have to look forward to! :)",

They will be able to answer all , if not most of your questions. The Mac book probably won\u2019t be the newest model, in my opinion. I\u2019m going for a sportscasting degree (just finished week 3 in month 2) congratulations on the start of your new journey !!!! You got this !!!",

I will be purchasing my own :) I didn\u2019t bother asking about the Mac model because really it doesn\u2019t matter lol but thank you for your input on it! I think I saw one person received the latest model, but others have been receiving the previous. I guess time will tell!",

She will be working from her phone until the MacBook is shipped. \nThe way it was explained to me is that basically when you reach a class you can not do from your phone, they send the MacBook. I think they do it this way so people don\u2019t enroll, get the products, and then drop out (selling the items). Of course I have no basis for that assumption, it just is the only explanation I can think for it.",

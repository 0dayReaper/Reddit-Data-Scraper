Unless you\u2019re entirely paid for by family, full sail will take any chance you have from succeeding in the biz.  Not even remotely a personal opinion, I\u2019m an audio engineer grad and hate to see hungry young audio-philes victimized by this scam",

[Here is their announcement page](https://go.fullsail.edu/coronavirus). I think everyone will need to wait until September and see what all the Universities are doing.\n\nIf the Music Production program is offered online, then I don't think it makes a difference.",

Some courses have labs meeting on campus starting June but I don\u2019t know which. I know they are doing that in small groups and only for classes that involve expensive/heavy equipment where they can\u2019t duplicate the instruction online.",

It also has a hefty music theory component as well.  MP is more for composers/producers than engineers to be precise.  It is given online and campus (though now the campus classes are given through Zoom).  \n\n\n(I am a faculty member)",

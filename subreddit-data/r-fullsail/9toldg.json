Full Sail employees seem to not agree on this time frame. Oh and what are the specs of it, I\u2019m hoping for someone to answer this that has gotten their\u2019s in the last 60 days but any acknowledgement works.",

            "comment": "I got mine right around the beginning of the fifth month/ end of the fourth month. I'm not sure if the specs are different for each degree program, but I have the 2.8 GHz with i7 chip, and 16 GB of RAM with 500 GB of internal memory. Typically you should receive your package after finishing the first 4 core classes, but I think it really depends on your degree, for example I'm in the Game Art program. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I hope this helped out a bit\ud83d\ude0a",

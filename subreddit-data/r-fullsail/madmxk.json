A week before my classes started (campus MP), full sail called me and tried convincing me to switch too online. I said no, whatever. \n\nEver since I started they call me once or twice a month trying to trick me into saying I will come to campus labs. Aren\u2019t they optional??\n\nI find this a little bit annoying, I know full sail looks at this reddit and probably knows who I am, but whatever.",

As far as I know, the campus is opening up back to normal begining of fall 2021.\n\nI am an on campus student as of July 2020 and I did my basic classes before coming down to Florida for the heavier programming classes, where I've attended every single on campus lab session possible, and it has helped me tremendously in success in PG1 and PG2.\n\nThese session for labs on campus are completely option as far as I know, and your grade is not hurt by not attending them.\n\nAs for why their calling you about changing, honestly, I have no idea. Maybe it's just a really bad game of telephone?\n\nHopefully if you call them and try getting into contact with your academic advisor they can make sure you don't get called anymore.\n\nBest of luck!",

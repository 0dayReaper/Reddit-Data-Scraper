    "postText": "Hey. please don't judge me. I dropped out for mental health reasons in 2017. Don't ask. I would like to know how to activate my pro tools license from when I was still there. I still have the iLok. I completely forgot my student email. I doubt I can even get in there anyways. What do I do? I'm in buttloads of debt the least thing they can do is let me keep my damn software. How do I activate my liscense? I have no idea how to get my old full sail email back.",

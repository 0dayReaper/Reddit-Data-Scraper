    "postText": "So far this whole school just hasn\u2019t been what i hoped for, i\u2019m thinking about transferring to Ucf. Should I finish the first academic year here being on my seventh month? I\u2019m in Ent business here and i\u2019m looking into their entertainment management program. Mainly because I feel ripped of partaking in this school\u2019s \u201ccampus\u201d program and looking for a cheaper alternative at a public school",

Game design and computer animation seem to be the only worthwhile programs. Sorry to hear it didn't work out, OP, it might be pretty tough to get any sort of credits to transfer. I'm unfamiliar with the curriculum of Ent Business, though.",

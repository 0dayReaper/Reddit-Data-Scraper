Most months are 1 class, there\u2019s a few where there\u2019s 2 but those classes are usually paired because they\u2019re easier or have less content. If I ever needed an extension because I didn\u2019t have enough time to get things done, my teachers were always cool about giving me more time as long as I let them know before deadlines.",

Other classes will fuck you up quick if you don't stay on top of it. \n\nAll in all, if you are dedicated and organized then it isn't too difficult. If you struggle with staying up with the work, or are a procrastinator, then it might not be for you.",

There have been some classes where I was able to pass with the bare minimum of 15 hours a week. Other classes I have had to repeat because of my work/personal life or just struggled to understand the concepts of the class in a timely manner. \n\nIt is doable, once you get past the first 3 classes find a place to study where you will not be disturbed. Get in the routine of doing homework on a set schedule and stick to it the best you can. \n\nI can\u2019t speak to the level of math required for the programs as I am not in any of those, but would imagine they are similar. IMO IT or cybersecurity is the best choice \ud83d\ude09\n\nBest of luck!",

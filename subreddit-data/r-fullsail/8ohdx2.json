Will the degree i earn get me a sustainable job?\nI'm curious because, full sails masters program is more into the production side of things like team management, production pipeline, you'd know it better than me.. Without any technical skills like programming, designing etc how can i expect a job at the end of the degree.. I'm desperate since I'm a foreign student and I'm spending a lot of money for one year..

                            "comment": "Thanks! The job market can be good or rough depending on what you decide to do in the program, so it really depends. For example, I was a psychology student who decided to go into the program, and as such I had no previous experience doing production, coding, or design at all, BUT I knew how to do research (which is why I joined the User Experience Lab (UX Lab) - more on this later). \n\nSince UX is in high demand right now, it wasn't terribly difficult for me to find a job, however I know many of my UX lab mates are still looking (months or even a year after graduating). As cliche as it sounds, you get out what you put in, and I worked my ass off doing extra side projects. With the exception of programmers, I know several artists, designers, producers, and animators who have yet to find a job, so it can be pretty rough.\n\nThe game design masters (GDMS) is a pretty diverse program in that its not just production related content. Also, the main takeaway in the program (for most people) is joining one of the several different \"capstones\". These capstones are basically like internships on campus that you will spend the majority of your time in the program and where you should really be putting most of your effort into. The classes often become a secondary priority.\n\nThe capstones you can join are: \nUX Lab (which is what I came to the school for)\nProduction (there are actually 2 separate ones)\nIndie Game Studio \nSerious Game Studio (aka CelleC)\nVR Lab (very selective and not many people join)\nIndependent (you generally dont want to do this one unless youre gonna be doing some really strange different stuff)\n\nIndie and CelleC basically function as a indie game studio where you work on different projects making a game. There are all sorts of people with diverse academic backgrounds in the studios from Recording arts, Creative Writing, business admin, design, art, animation, etc. To give you some extra context, I almost joined CelleC but I changed my mind (and I had never done any design work before).\n\nIn order to join these capstones you have to shadow in them and basically just work on their projects. In order to get accepted you have to bring something to the team skills/knowledge wise and have them like you enough as these are the people you will be working with for the majority of the year.\n\nAs for not knowing any technical skills/knowledge, all of this can be learned and if thats what you want to do, I'd start learning now.\n\nIt's definitely a risk, but it ended up being worth it for me.\n\nEdit: I was an on-campus student fyi\n",

I now know there are multiple things I can pursue in the program. I'm basically a programmer, I'm not the best but I'm getting better at it. However, based on what you said looks like User Experience research is good now and I'll keep an eye on that when I start in college. When I looked at the website of the program offered in full sail I was thinking why would I want to become a producer or even get into management of projects when there's MBA professionals lurking in to do it since it's their main skill.. I'm not entirely sure what I can bring to a team in capstones as of now, but I know a little bit of programming like I mentioned and I also work with Unity.. \n\n  \n1.\\) Could you suggest what specific capstone or subprogram I would want to concentrate once I go to fullsail? Although it entirely depends on me..   \n\n\nAlso, were you a on\\-campus student? \n\n2.\\)What kind of side projects you worked on during your stay?,\n\n I don't mind working hard especially considering it's a one year program. I just hope to find a job at the end of it as I want to pay my student debt, which side of the program would you suggest has a good future ?\n\n3.\\) what are the living expenses per month, I don't want anything fancy, living expenses alone costs me half of my tuition money..    \n\n\nYour help is really appreciated, I was doing research about the campus, the game design career and what to expect in future, gaming is a saturated field and I don't want to be lost. Your response is the most accurate I've come across. ",

You can do some coding in the VR track but you generally have to be pretty good to get in (as it requires some serious math stuff - vector/ray related stuff, dont remember the name). Both game studios mostly use Unity so I'd start getting more familiar with that.\n\n2) While I was working in the UX Lab I did wrote and performed research for a master's thesis and helped out with some projects in the Serious Game Studio. The thesis actually used to be a requirement in the program before they took it out a few years ago. They replaced it with a \"Mastery Journal\" (which is a joke btw). Since I was a psychology student with a good research background (and possibly wanting to do a PhD eventually) this was basically a must for me to stand out as a newcomer to UX Research. \n\nWhile you don't have to be as hardcore as I did with a thesis, doing any sort of personal research (and writing it up/publishing it) on the side is a great idea and can help you stand out more. Some of the previous theses and research I've seen are like analyzing narrative structures in Telltale games, designing audio/music to be more emotional, or how to code realistic AI.\n\nOther students I know did freelance art on the side, or worked on a game with their classmates, or found a project on campus that needed help with something. Having a portfolio to show with all the stuff you did is very important.\n\n3) This is definitely the kicker. I was spending like $1400 a month on living expenses so it can be rough\n\n---------\n\nAs for the \"best side of the program\" to have a \"good future\" is not really the mindset you should be going in with as all of them are great in their own way. Its definitely very difficult to break into the game industry, so my advice to you would be to find out which capstone fits your interests the best, and then work towards doing your best in that capstone/extra activities in order to market yourself as a top job prospect.",

I would definitely want to try the production side of the program as it's more challenging and involves collaborating with lot of individuals specializing in their own areas of interest. However, I'll also work on programming with the two indie studios you spoke about, I'm familiar with Unity and I'll keep working with that. \n\nI'm also going to work on any projects on campus and do freelance work on the side, this is a great idea and thanks for the input. Based on my research on the industry, I felt it's important to have a network and market your work online or build a portfolio and you've confirmed that for me.\n\nI've heard many negative reviews about fullsail and I was worried if I was making a conscious choice of selecting the university but I think it all depends on me now. \n\nI don't know you but you've given me a lot of useful information and it was difficult to find the graduates of game design master's but luckily you saw my post. I would have never gotten the information about capstones since I thought there was only going to be one project I'll do at the end of the program but now I see I can work on different capstones from the beginning and see where I best fit. I think 12 month program is little compact but I have no complaints just worried how I'll keep up with everything. \nOn living expenses, I think it's a bummer. I'm not ready to spend that kind of money, I'll probably find roommates and split up..\n\n",

It's expensive, and exhausting, and aggrivating at times, but it like I said before, you get out what you put in.\n\nThis is mainly for undergraduate degrees, but there are A LOT of students who go there because \"they like playing games\" or \"they like music\" and they think itd be fun to do it too and they aren't prepared for the work load and flunk out. \n\nEven in the masters program there were people that I thought SHOULD NOT be there but since Full Sail pretty much accepts anyone with a brain this causes a massive drop out rate, or people doing the bare minimum and not being able to find a job. \n\nFull Sail provides you with all the tools to succeed, but its up to the student to go the extra mile and stand out from the rest of the students who are sitting around doing nothing. The program goes by quick so you want to hit the ground running and keep that goal of finding a job in sight.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have any personal questions.",

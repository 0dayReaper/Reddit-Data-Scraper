Usually the portfolio classes and scriptwriting, we\u2019re the hardest because they nitpick at everything. However, I was also taking those courses during peak season, which was a bit challenging because of how exhausting it is. Other than that, online classes are challenging, but not to the point where you\u2019re going to stress about it during work. It really just depends on the instructor and time management.\n\nI think you\u2019ll be able to work while taking online courses.",

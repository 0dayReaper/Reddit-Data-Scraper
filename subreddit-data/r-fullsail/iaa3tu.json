    "postText": "I have recently been in communication with their admissions dept to start their graphic design bachelors program at the end of this month. When I was speaking to them she told me that if I received the full pell grant amount and received the scholarship I most likely wouldn\u2019t have to pay anything out of pocket. But seeing as that the full pell grant is $6345 a year and the scholarship is up to 25k to be applied to the entire degree (which is 54k not including the launch box)  those numbers just aren\u2019t adding up. I have another appt with them to finish the enrollment on Tuesday but am trying to find anyone who has both types of financial ad that can let me know if they had to also pay out of pocket or take out loans",

            "comment": "Well first off remember that you are only doing the math for ONE year of financial aid.  You will get two years to cover that gap. I use pell grants, momentum and student loans to pay for everything and not pay out of pocket (yet).  If Full Sail is the right school for you then whatever it takes will be worth it.  I love it here and cannot recommend it enough.",

I had to literally use everything to not pay out of pocket now because I couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s gonna be a lot so you have to plan out what you\u2019re gonna pay after. Just expect to have to use all of your financial aid if you\u2019re gonna go here.",

Which is best to not pay so much after you get your degree",

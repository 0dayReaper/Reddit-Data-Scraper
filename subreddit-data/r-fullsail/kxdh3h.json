    "postText": "I\u2019ve been attending this school for 6 months and frankly i\u2019m disappointed. While the curriculum and teachers are fine, the main reason I went to this school was for the social aspect of networking with students in different fields and contributing to collaborative efforts. I\u2019m majoring in business and most of my classes so far have had only the same 4\u20135 people, and all 100% online. As someone who came here for the social aspect and for meeting new people, I wish I had chose another school. Anyone else feel this way?",

I received my BA &amp; MA at two different traditional brick and mortar universities and chose Full Sail specifically for the collaboration and networking connection to the industry. Before covid, it seemed like Full Sail had networking opportunities constantly. Now, I feel like everything (even zoom/webinar networking) has been cut back and thrown to the wayside. The sad thing is, I\u2019ve witnesses the schools I went to before become more proactive about networking in the time of Covid-19. \n\nEvery time Full Sail sends out a \u2018how are things going?\u2019 Survey I comment about my dissatisfaction but it seems to go no where.",

Outside of making online events that most people would probably ignore or not care about, I'm not sure how much they're would be to do. I'm not really understanding blaming the school or being upset at them when they can only do so much and it's up to the would be attendees to make the most out of it. It's literally the whole \"you can lead a horse to water but can't make them drink\". Especially in a city (if yall are in Orlando) whose state has one of the highest cases of Covid.",

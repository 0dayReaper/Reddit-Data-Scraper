    "postText": "Hey guys, I am a student at Full Sail University and I am currently taking a class called Digital Marketing. For this class, as an assignment, I was put into a group and we need to create a survey to analyze an event and use the data we collect to come up with a marketing plan for said event.\n\nIf you have a free 5 minutes to spare, the assignment calls for at least 50 responses and every response we get greatly helps out my group.\n\nThank you in advance and here is the link!\n\nhttp://goo.gl/forms/Y6mrLJzGjn ",

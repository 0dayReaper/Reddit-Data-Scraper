    "postText": "So I've been wanting to go to Film School for a few years now, I've always been interested in the movie making process, especially in terms of cinematography, VFX, and everything behind-the-scenes. My state doesn't have any noteworthy film schools, and I'm looking to hopefully, eventually, start my career. To all the alumni, is Full Sail a worthy investment of my time and money, even online courses, if I want to start a future in film?",

I decided a while ago that I wanted to make movies so I enrolled and am on my way to get my bachelors in digital cinematography, all online! I\u2019m only 2 classes in but so far I am learning very valuable information! What\u2019s really exciting is that Full Sail helps you get a job in whatever your concentration was once you graduate. They also will let you participate in online school from any state, but because the school is on the east coast you would have to make sure any assignments and deadlines are submitted in Eastern Standard Time. Feel free to message me if you have more questions!",

For my program they also give you a camera, tablet, editing software etc. for making content for the later classes but the cost is automatically taken added to your tuition. I think it\u2019s definitely worth it! The material comes at you fast tho so if you aren\u2019t ready to take it seriously, I\u2019d hold off. The advisors are thoroughly helpful and will take your calls at pretty much anytime so if you have any specific questions, give em a call!",

Since I don\u2019t know much about the cinematography major I would recommend checking out Kamryn Armani on YT. She in digital cinematography online and goes through what to expect for each month. I hope this helps.",

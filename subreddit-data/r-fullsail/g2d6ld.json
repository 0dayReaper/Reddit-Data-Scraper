In the site it says that \" If you participated in Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate programs in high school and have taken the national exams, you may be eligible to have your score reviewed for Full Sail transfer credit. \" I myself have not given the national exams and I am not looking forward to. Can I still apply for a barchelors at game design?",

To get into the BA of Game Design or the BA of Computer Science classes they have an insane 3-part math test that is notoriously brutal.",

I think you\u2019re talking about the Game Development program. Many people switch from game dev to design because they can\u2019t get through the math.",

I was going to do computer science but saw the math PRACTICE entry exam and noped right on out of the program to Web Dev.  I've been a Full Stack Web Developer for 2 years (doing the BA just to make job finding easier and gain a pay boost) already and am in training at a new job to become a Cloud Automation guy (aka DevOps), so i figured I may as well just do Web Dev.",

Once you do this, they will send you an answer sheet to check yourself with.\nAfter that, they send you the info to log into their test site and take the actual exam. I just completed it this morning. It is 36 questions, and you have 3 hours to complete it. If you score a 70 or higher, then you proceed into the course as planned. Getting a 30-69 will place you into the Intro Math courses, which must be completed before you can move into your core classes. Scoring less then a 30 means you have to talk to an Advisor about either a retest or changing your program. If you retest, you have to make at least a 40 to get into the program, and you will have to take the Intro classes regardless of score on retest. Hope this helps.",

I have experience in the freelance world and have been editing for a while. I an considering go to Full sail for the connections, experience and to further work on my craft. I can handle the hard work I just would like to know is it going to be worth the 90k + debt? And are there better ways to make connections and get experience without going ? Also what are the chances of landing big jobs like marvel?",

            "comment": "Look into the instructors currently working at Full Sail in the film program. See if they have credits on any movies/shows that are connected to the kinds of people and studios you'd want to work for.\n\nFilm school can be invaluable for connections, as much as it is for actually learning the craft. Keep in mind that a lot of Marvel stuff is being shot out of Atlanta at this point, so if there is a film program there, it's _possible_ instructors there may have stronger connections with Marvel, in particular.\n\nHowever, Full Sail now has an LED Volume stage, and having a chance to work on that could be the experience needed to give you a leg up on Disney+ productions.\n\nConnections are very hard to grind out on your own, but if you want to make use of film school for connections you're going need to be ready to work harder than your classmates and make a huge impression on your instructors.\n\nAlso check how many of your community college credits transfer to Full Sail! It can save you both time and money!",

Anecdotal I know. Even some of the good film people aren't doing it professionally but still work on shorts and stuff for fun. Honestly I would teach yourself, plenty of online resources. Film is a industry where the portfolio/connections is more valuable than the degree.",

Its evil what they are doing to manipulate young people with a dream. I was 19 when i went on the tour and was so excited about going. It was nothing like that tour seemed. Half ass teachers, and even if you find a job in film, I highly doubt you will be breaking 40-50k a year which is pretty much nothing with inflation.. The education was mediocre, and I have not once used my full sail degree to get a job. I had to redo college all over again after credits from my \"BS\" degree didnt transfer. Me going to a different college and getting a more traditional and real education made me realized how manipulated I was when going there. Im one of the lucky ones, making six figures as a developer. Id say 60-80 percent of students who graduate from their do not get a decent job with their degree, and when i say decent, breaking 40-50 k a year. You can have a much, much better education at a community college for way less. Dont fall for it. I know so many people that went there and are 50-90k in debt spending like they were going to make it big in whatever industry their degree is based on.",

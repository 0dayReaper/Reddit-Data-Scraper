    "postText": "Question for anyone who has recently been issued a license with Zbrush. Zbrush partnered with a new company, and they changed how things work in regard to educational/academic licenses. From the email I received, they just don't offer it anymore. It's an annual subscription basically. It's very affordable, but still a subscription. \n\nI know previously that you received a full copy (student license was still a full copy, just couldn't be used in a for-profit manner). Do we pay for the annual subscription, or do they just provide you with a full license at this point? I tried reaching out to the school about this, and I couldn't get a clear answer from anyone.",

            "comment": "I'm curious as to how it may have changed after the first. With zbrush being acquired ny a different company, the student liscence is no longer offered. The only options now are subscription, or a full liscence. The full liscence is twice as much as the student liscence use to be. I couldn't find anything about it, and when I reached out to the school no one I spoke to knew. \n\nI'm asking it'd only going to effect people after the 1/1/22.",

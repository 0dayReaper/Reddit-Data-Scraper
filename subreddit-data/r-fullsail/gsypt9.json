    "postText": "Sorry I am new to Reddit and full sail. I am hoping to have my daughter start in July or August for the game design certificate. I was wondering what actually came with the launch box in the game design certificate program because it still appears to come with Ruumi VR, but no VR headset. I don\u2019t want her to be at a disadvantage if she needs it, I would be willing to see about purchasing her a headset. The same with the HP zbook, but no lo-Jack? I tried to reach tech support over phone and ask them but they gave me no real answers just an automated type response that \u201cthey don\u2019t know\u201d.\n\nHas anyone taken a certificate course and could you also tell me if it\u2019s worth it? What if she decides she likes it and wants to move onto a bachelors will the credits transfer?",

There's nothing Full Sail(especially online) can do for your daughter's education that a traditional college can't, if they're considering the game design/development field they're much better off getting a Software/Computer Engineering degree and studying the extras on their own time. Game design is a challenging field to break into and having a degree in just game design makes it even more difficult to find a job since the market is saturated and there's very few other jobs they'd be qualified for. If you would like more information message me and I'll answer any questions you may have.",

I will talk to her about the field she wants to go in and tell her about the other degrees you mentioned that would encompass her passion and assist her in finding meaningful employment in the future. Thank you",

I was under the impression that the game design certificate was available in person but perhaps I'm wrong.\n\n\nIn any case, yes the credits will transfer to a full bachelor's degree, and yes the launch box does include the vr headset and laptop. Honestly I've had more luck directing launch box questions and Fernando Delacruz, who runs the game design  program at Fullsail, do you might find luck with him as well.",

I was concerned that it would not come with the same laptop, or a VR headset as the bachelors counterpart. When I read into the certificate and the included items, I didn\u2019t see a VR headset included on the certificate page located here https://www.fullsail.edu/degrees/game-design-certificate. The bachelors counterpart does show a headset being included so I did not want her to be at a disadvantage if her classes required her to utilize it for online learning or creation.",

Really weird.\n\n\nIt's possible that they forgot it when they were updating the online launch box lists, or it's possible that the certificate program doesn't require the headset. I'm really not 100% sure  which is the case, but either way you shouldn't need to buy anything.",

Your daughter is better off like the comment above going into the computer science field if she is truly passionate about game design and you want to help her out sign her up for the unity membership ( not the most expensive one) they have their own tutorials on how to run the program they made. I learned more watching and doing the unity videos than i did going at fullsail. \n\nThe instructors for online are very unprofessional they dont respond in time and it seems that they are quicker to fail students than to help them pass trust me i speak from experience i had to take one of the game design classes again because i had reached out to the instructor never answered whatever i still finished the assignment submitted in at about 12:20, 12 was the deadline did all the work it was correct but still had to take it all over again. I dont mean to disappoint you or your daughter but what i am saying is there are better options than fullsail",

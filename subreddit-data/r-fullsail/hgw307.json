    "postText": "So, I am in the process of starting the Computer Science program Online at Full Sail. I am very excited to do this, because I have had a deep interest in programming and software development. The first thing I was curious about was what programming languages they teach/work in? I have a background with Java/JavaScript/CSS/Python. The other thing is the Launch Box program. My current desktop is pretty nice: Ryzen 7 3700X, MSI Ventus OC 2070 Super, 32GB  RAM, 1TB SSD + 4TB HDD. Is it worth it to get the Launch Box when I already have a decent computer?\n\nThanks for any help you can provide!",

            "comment": "It is worth the launchbox just because it comes with ebook and other software you need. You can opt out of the laptop part, but it may cause problems in graphic class due to drivers. I went for sim vis. Wo learned the same things as game dev. We learnedc, c#, c++, some Java and python, and touched on others, along with learning unity game engine pretty well.",

I have a desktop pc with a core i7 9700k and a gtx 1060 but I'm still getting the launch box because it includes all of the programs you need for your program and I dont think you want to being your desktop to class with you everyday",

The test is the same for Comp Sci, Game Dev, Vis/Sim. There are 3 outcomes. Score over 70% and you move ahead as planned, Score between 69%-30% and you have to take some remediation classes(Pre-Calc and Calculus), Score less than 30% and you have to talk to an advisor about changing your program.",

I was wondering if you have a discord maybe we could do math on khanacademy.org together?",

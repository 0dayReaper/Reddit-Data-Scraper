In the first classes that are general education credits, I would look ahead to topics you expect to learn so when you get to them, you already have basic understanding of them. \n\nThink story structure, composition techniques, basics of Premiere, etc. In my free time I watch This Guy Edits on YouTube, and that ended up being a great base for Advanced Post Production. Things like that.\n \nAlso networking. You\u2019ll learn the basics in your portfolio class, but joining groups on Facebook, Reddit, etc., and then forming connections with other professionals. \n\nWhen you get to Composition and Visual Design, Baker will have sooooo many additional resources to look at. I copied and pasted everything onto a single document and I\u2019m still watching those in my free time! \n\nAlso, tip for classes: 3 credit hour class, considerable amount of free time for extra research and things outside of class. 4 credit hours or more class, just focus on the homework for that class (credit hours are listed in the course handbook on fullsail.com). This is based on school work and working a full time job.\n\nPsychology of Play (your second class) will have great study tips and definitely try them all out to see what works best for you! Time management is key with this degree \ud83d\ude0a",

Literally ask as many questions as possible, it\u2019ll help a lot. \n\nThey did make the DCBS program for anyone, regardless of experience. You might have to work a bit harder at learning the equipment, but Composition and Visual Design is a great bootcamp! Plan to spend several hours in assignments that month, but once you do, you\u2019ll have it memorized, and all the other classes build on top of that one.",

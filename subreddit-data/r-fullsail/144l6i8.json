Grants will not have to be paid off reducing your overall cost.\n\nStudent loans you will set up a plan to start paying back after graduation. \n\nYou can also apply for scholarships which will reduce the total cost by the amount awarded.\n\nSo while it\u2019s 60k+ for the entire program you can knock a decent amount off with some effort.",

I\u2019m currently doing CA online and I\u2019m rolling in with no experience whatsoever and I\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m flat out lost for the most part lol but I\u2019m a stay at home dad and have a crap ton of free time to try and nail things down. If I didn\u2019t have that availability I\u2019d probably not pass my first class. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut I mean, If you\u2019ve got the ability to figure stuff out quickly, the availability to slam a ton of long assignments out every week on time with minimal assistance you\u2019ll be golden. \n\nBut I\u2019m doing the associates program for animation and my tuition total was $34k before they adjusted to factor in recently graduating the graphic design program and removing the courses I already passed.",

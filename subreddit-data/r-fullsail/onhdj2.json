Instructors are also required to meet a number of yearly milestones as far as keeping up current with the industry and technologies. This is standard for most colleges and universities. \n\n*Some* Course Directors do have higher education than required but that will vary depending on the course. \n\nThe school is nationally accredited but not regionally accredited for a number of reasons.",

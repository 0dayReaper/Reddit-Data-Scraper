They\u2019re really easy, which also makes them really boring, so you have to be disciplined to get through them.",

Sincerely looking out for you. \n\nIt\u2019s cool to ask questions in this sub about what the real experience of going to the school is like or specific issues, but the course list that is easily available from the site? \n\nFor real, if you\u2019re thinking about dropping that much money on a degree, you need to look up and read descriptions of ALL of the classes you\u2019ll be taking, the accreditation of the school, the living situation/notes about the community if you\u2019ll go to FL, etc. This is a massive decision with tons of moving parts, and you need to be as informed about this as you would about any other major financial situation that is going to impact your life for decades. Don\u2019t let yourself get blindsided by something you would absolutely not have been okay with needing to do/learn/be okay with half way through an expensive program when you\u2019re going to feel that $45k you\u2019ve already spent (a little more than the cost of a 2023 BMW 330i) for half a degree and the sunk cost fallacy screaming in your ear.\n\nMake sure you know everything before committing to this.",

The first 4 classes were basic classes everyone had to take and I think they were just about industry basics. I don\u2019t quite remember lol. But they weren\u2019t terrible and I\u2019m in the online program, so it\u2019s a new class every month. After that, I took some program specific prerequisites like statistics. Sorry, I just really can\u2019t remember them. They went by so quick. \n\nIf you go on the website and look up the program, it shows you exactly what classes and in what order you take them. It\u2019s pretty idiot proof.",

Talk to admissions if you have previous college experience and want to see if any of those credits will transfer.\n\n2) Some students are eligible to test out of some of these classes. Doing so will save you time and a bit of money. Talk to admissions for more information about testing out.",

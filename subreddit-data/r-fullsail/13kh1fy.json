            "comment": "Don't. I did game design, and I regret it more than anything in my life. This new redesign is supposed to be redone with a new direction. But it isn't only the courses that are failures. It's the instructors as well, and they have the same instructors. I had to spend SO MUCH of my own time and money to teach myself the things FS should have been teaching me. Save your money and time, and go elsewhere. Unless you want to spend 60% of your time on busy work, like essays about nothing, and not learning how to make or design video games.",

They either couldn't get hired afterward, hated their time at FS, had to teach themselves, or were severely under prepared when they got into the industry. But don't worry,  there will be one or two people in here that will pop in and tell some success stories. Whether they're telling the truth or not, who knows, but from my experience, their type of story is VERY rare.",

A degree is the most basic form of education in a field. You absolutely need to spend extra time outside of school to learn, practice, and sharpen your skills. Of course there\u2019s a lot of simple assignments, because it is focused on entry-level people who are learning the field for the first time.\n\nNo matter what school you attend and graduate from, hiring managers will want to see what you can do and if all you can show are samples from school then you\u2019re almost guaranteed to not get hired unless for a intern or similar role.\n\nI got hired by a AAA studio half way into my degree but I also spent a ton of my time working on my portfolio.\n\nNot impossible to get hired, just don\u2019t expect to get hired simply because you graduated from Full Sail or any other school.",

There's two maybe three I know who had problem getting jobs during Covid and I've lost contact with since. You get out what you put in. Can't comment though on how the updated degree program is though.",

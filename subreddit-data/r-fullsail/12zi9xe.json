            "comment": "Some things, like rubrics, are required of the faculty and will always be copy pasted with different values filled in. Often instructors have quick notes for things they see often in certain assignments with all of their core advice and links to resources, for instance, ready to go for the sake of getting feedback turned around within a week. Usually there will be notes that are specific to the individual as part of these elements or following them.\n\nI\u2019m not making excuses for instructors that leave you with questions (ask the questions, seek clarity, often that leads to awesome conversations and really useful insight), but you should know that pretty much every instructor there is burned out and overworked, some turning around 50-75 individual feedback elements per assignment per week. So if you are doing 2 assignments a week for a class and they have two sections, that\u2019s anywhere from 10-50 students (and that\u2019s if they don\u2019t have an adjunct section too, which could add another 10-25), that\u2019s 20-100 things they need to review, annotate, and respond to within 7 days, on top of teaching sessions online/in class (often both), administrative work (attendance, records annotations), curriculum development (there\u2019s no one but the instructors to write and organize the material), and any other meetings/continuing education they have been assigned (Hall of Fame week, for instance). Your instructors are trying really hard to keep their heads above water and get you each some kind of note on each assignment. It\u2019s fair that you might feel it\u2019s all stretched, though. If you think they seem overworked, they absolutely are. They\u2019re overworked, underpaid, and against the wall. \n\nIf that makes you feel frustrated, I recommend you skip taking it out on your frontline team of teachers and express your frustration at the people who set your teachers and you up for this rough situation you\u2019re mutually in. \n\nBut, again, ask questions, seek clarification, and if the feedback you get doesn\u2019t seem to give you what you wanted, ask for more  and you\u2019ll likely be pleasantly surprised at the response.",

I've found myself a bit frustrated on occasion with the canned feedback, but still treat every teacher with respect and dignity cause I have friends who teach and it's not an easy career path at all. Also it's just not nice to be rude to a fellow creative over things outside of their control. \n\nI honestly don't know how they do it, the older I get the more I realize good teachers are more valuable than their weight in gold.\n\nAlso, whenever I've personally messaged instructors with questions or concerns, I get personal replies. Helps remind me that they're not copy pasting because they don't care but because of the sheer amount of assignments they need to grade in such a short period of time.",

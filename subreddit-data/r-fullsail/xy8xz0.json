    "postText": "   Just a quick question. I'm attending the Bachelors degree program for Creative writing and I'm almost to the finish line. However, I wanted to ask anyone if they're scared about their grades for their grammar. My highest grade for grammar has been an 8 out of 10, but my lowest has been a 5 out of 10. It seems like some professors are lot more nit picky about grammar while others will find one mistake and say it's okay.\n    I'm honestly getting scared though because I would like to publish a book and even work for Nuaghty Dog in their narrative department, but it seems like my instructors never like my grammar. I'm just wondering of this is just me or are other people going through this?",

There are some issues in this post that I would personally edit (and some objective typos). That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not a writer, so I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. Take all we have learned about storytelling and apply it to your ideas. Tarantino scripts have horrible grammar, but the stories sell the script. \n\nProse is a bit different\u2014as it won\u2019t be on the screen, but actually read by your audience\u2014but you\u2019ll have an editor. Focus on your storytelling and continuing to hone your grammar (the LinkedIn course, Grammarly, or lessons from the Grammar Girl are quality), and let the editor do their job.\n\nA narrative department should be all about story. You can\u2019t be illiterate, but they shouldn\u2019t expect grammatical perfection (or editors wouldn\u2019t have jobs).\n\nIf you want to *be* an editor, then you\u2019d need to really perfect the craft to get work.\n\nYou could even install Grammarly on your computer, and it will help tremendously by making grammatical suggestions as you write.",

It will flag grammatical errors and misplaced punctuation, too, while telling you the rule you\u2019ve broken. I haven\u2019t used it in a long time, but it was pretty accurate from what I remember.\n\nIt would catch several errors in OP\u2019s post, and he/she could learn from it by remembering what it suggests and applying it to their future work. It\u2019s a tool. It shouldn\u2019t be the only method of learning, but it\u2019s useful. \n\nRetaking the LinkedIn course should be their focus.",

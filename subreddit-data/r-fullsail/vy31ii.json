Going to Graduate with a 3.0 now my main concern is finding a job in the industry. Best or luck to you my friend and if you need anything let me know I'll do my best to help if I can :)",

The main thing is this is a script writing course. You're going to focus in reading scripts and writing short stories. We do critique each other a lot. You'll participate in weekly discussion boards and work with other classmates too. The workload is kind of on you and it can be heavy at times. You really get out of the program what you give. It's over before you know it so just make sure you give it your all.",

Just weird that we don\u2019t read some classic literature. Some of that was wildly experimental and can be mined for inspiration. I\u2019m obsessed with Literary Theory as well. I\u2019m assume none of that is covered.",

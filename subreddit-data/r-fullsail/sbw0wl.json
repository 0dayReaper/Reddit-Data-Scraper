    "postText": "I'm aware this is a highly subjective question with mixed opinions but for context relating to me:\n\n- I am interested in starting off the storyboard route with interest in that leading to something in animation.\n\n- I am stuck deciding on the digital art &amp; design bachelor's route because I do also have an interest in digital painting, Illustrating, figure drawing, comics, etc. \n\n- the computer Animation degree covers a lot in digital 3d art which seemed useful for the next step after storyboarding as it seems most animated projects these days are leaning towards 3d &gt; illustrated. \n\n-  my animation/art interest lean  towards the \"Arcane\" Netflix series or Sony's \" Into the Spider verse\" style of art which seemed more \"digital art\" to that of Pixar's 3d animation style. But considering future projects and the direction of most animation these days, 3d animation seems to be where the jobs will be in the future. Making me believe computer Animation would be ideal. Paying so much for this degree, I'd like to have at least a little confidence in my future abilities to pay it off \ud83d\ude05\n\nFrom what I've been seeing most of the alumni working for professional studios (Pixar, Disney, marvel, etc) have the computer Animation degree &gt; the digital art one.\n\nWith my interests leaning towards character creation &amp; development or storyboarding for big animation projects. is it more ideal to go the computer Animation route or Digital Art &amp; Design?",

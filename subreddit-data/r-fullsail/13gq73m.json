I am a teacher as my primary profession but I also have the Computer Animation BS from Full Sail and I have a background in both design and web development.\n\nSo far, I have had an absolutely amazing time in the degree, though there is definitely a variation from class to class. Every instructor I have interacted with has a doctorate in education and an immense portfolio of work within their field. As with every course at Full Sail, it is up to you to make the most of that. I have, and it has pad off in spades. I have worked with some absolutely brilliant professionals.\n\nThat said, the foundation of every course is solid but the quality varies. Each professor has an idea of what their class should be, and that may not gel with your expectations. However, I have found that if you reach out to your professor, actively participate, and are open about asking questions, they are more than willing to work it out with you.\n\nI will say: I have worked with other students that have not had the same experience as me. There is at least some expectation that you will have some fluency with Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite, and there is a LOT of research involved. Some students come in with little technical experience and get a bit blind-sided.\n\nAll-in-all, as with most Full Sail courses, it is what you make of it. It can be incredibly valuable, but it's up to you to make it so.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to reach out.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m currently in college for English arts for teaching. Since I was a freshman, I had dreams of doing a creative writing degree, but the real world got ahold of me and I still hope to do something along these lines, but I still Jojo I have time if I really want to change. So my question is how has your degree benefited you? How has it been negative? Have you got much placement/jobs after graduation?",

A college education is valuable for the skills and knowledge you gain, not for the piece of paper that says you did it.\n\nYour professional, post-grad success is going to depend on how well you are able to apply what you learned in the real world. If you struggle finding work or success, you can\u2019t blame the school. That\u2019s on you.\n\nSo as far as how valuable a Full Sail Creative Writing degree is in and of itself, it\u2019s the same as any other degree. It\u2019s good to have, but it\u2019s no guarantee. As far as the classes, the experience, the instructors, the practice, the support.... as a creative writing graduate I couldn\u2019t be happier with what I got, even I have yet to become some fancy Hollywood writer or whatever.",

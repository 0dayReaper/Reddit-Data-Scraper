Yes, the music programs have theory courses and there is lots of software-specific production coursework, but it does not advertise itself as a music conservatory, and you should not expect to find one when you arrive there. \n\nI suggest you dedicate yourself to perfecting your musical skill with your instrument, learn with teachers in either ensembles or privately, and maybe apply to a conservatory or music school when you\u2019ve got your chops to the point where you need a push to another level. Berklee College of Music is excellent, and I happen to know that a number of former and current FS music production teachers went there themselves.",

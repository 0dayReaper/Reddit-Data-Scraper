I understand networking is key but in your experience was it worth the student debt? Does full sail have the job opportunity they\u2019ve been promising me? Internship possibilities? Again I understand this is all about how hard I\u2019m willing to work and I\u2019m willing to work my ass off, I just don\u2019t want it to be for nothing. Thanks guys!",

            "comment": "I am not a film major but I graduated from the computer animation program. Right after I graduated the school helped me get an unpaid internship at a very small animation studio not far from the school. After the internship I would get emails every once in a while for very weird \"opportunities\" for work. I call them weird because every job offering was from some independent contractor type looking for full out movie quality animations for advertisements or films or whatever... Nothing a new grad could accomplish on their own. I was very turned off from these and eventually l stopped receiving emails from the school. It seemed like the HR department was just forwarding emails they were receiving from people who don't know what they are talking about it or even what they are looking for to new grads. I spent 2 years applying to every job posting and even every studio I could find. I never got a single reply back, and my demo reel was decent. So like I tell everyone, I really enjoyed my time at the school but the industry is what sucks. Not worth paying $1,000 a month in student loans for 20+ years for a degree I'm never going to use. But that's just my experience. There have been success stories from graduates but they are very few and far between. My honest opinion is that most things this school teaches in all of its degree programs can be found for free online or at much less expensive schools.",

Don't get me wrong, I honestly really liked the school and I never pushed myself as hard at anything in life as I did there. We literally had classes taught by Disney animators! But they don't bother to tell you to research the entertainment industry before you enroll in classes. Which is why I didn't figure out until after I graduated why Disney animators were technically out of work and teaching at a college..",

After filling out the FAFSA, the school called me back and said I would end up with $45K in loans plus interest. How accurate is that? Can the numbers the school give me be trusted? Because when I read people's comments regarding Full Sail's price for a degree, they always say they end up with more than a $100K in debt.",

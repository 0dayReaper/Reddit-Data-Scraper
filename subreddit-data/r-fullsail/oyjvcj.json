    "postText": "I want to go to Full Sail in January, but I need money to pay for one year. I have some benefits that would pay for the first year, but I have nothing for the second. \n\nSo, I've been spending a ton of time looking for scholarships recently, but have been having a really hard time finding anything that applies to me. \n\n\\-Racially, I'm very mixed; Mostly Vietnamese and European. White passing. \n\n\\-I already have a Bachelor's degree; I wanted to go back to school to get a second degree. I wanted to study music production or recording arts. \n\n\\-GPA 4.0 in college, pretty close to 4.0 in high school \n\n\\-Child of a single parent, my father died when I was very young. No longer have a relationship with my mother (you could say I was disowned)\n\nI've been really trying to look, but most scholarships just don't apply to me. I've been on tons of sites, I just spent like an hour and a half looking through a lift of 82, but I still haven't found much.   \n\n\nDoes anyone know of any?",

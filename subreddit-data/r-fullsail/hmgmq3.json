    "postText": "I am about 3 years removed from graduating Full Sail (BS Computer Animation) I ended up getting a graphic design job that is pretty unrelated to my degree. Now I am noticing the gaps in my knowledge because I was never fully trained in GD. \n\nMy question is this: Is it possible to go back and audit classes not in the CA degree program or are my audits exclusively for classes I have already taken? \n\nFollow up: would the next step be to contact someone at the university? I'm just unfamiliar with the steps involved. \n\nThanks for any help you can give.",

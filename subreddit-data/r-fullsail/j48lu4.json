I'm not happy spending semester after semester on filler classes just to fulfill the university core at my current school. Looking for something more focused. I also work full time, will this be a do-able degree?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

Each class is only a month long. I worked full time while doing it and I didn't have a problem keeping up but I work third shifts so even at work I can do my classwork. Really you get out of it what you put in.",

I already had enough credits for my associate's so I took that since I wasn't sure when I'd be ready to return. Now that I'm back in a good place i'll be starting classes again at the end of this month.",

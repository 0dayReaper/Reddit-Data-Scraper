How many academic standards points does it increase each class you fail? Because I don\u2019t want to get kicked out. I was told 2 or 3 but I\u2019m just asking to be sure",

If you've failed more than one class, tell us how many and we can figure out the formula. \n\nI've got absolutely no experience with this though, so I could be way off.",

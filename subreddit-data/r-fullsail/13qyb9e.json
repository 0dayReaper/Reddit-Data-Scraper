    "postText": "Hey everyone, \n\nWhile I am waiting for the relaunch team to get back to me, I decided I would post my question here. I have tried to find answers online but can't seem to find anything. \n\nI attended Full Sail for Game Dev online back in 2021. I got 5 months into the program, passed all my classes with A's but had to drop due to life circumstances. I also received almost all my launch box items (minus some software).\n\nLife has finally settled down again and I want to pick up Full Sail again. Has anyone been in this situation that can shed some light on how it works to return to the school? Do you get new launch box items to update your hardware/software?\n\nAny advice or insight would be awesome!",

They do answer the phone extremely quickly but unfortunately they need to transfer me over to the \"relaunch team\" to assist me and answer my questions. That's where the 7-10 days comes in. They say it's a small team and they are always busy when I call in. Hoping to hear from them soon though.",

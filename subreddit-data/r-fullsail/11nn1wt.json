I\u2019m currently online student and looking to move down after graduation, and need an idea of what classes look like as I have my family who is moving with me.",

My classes were usually 4 hours of lecture followed by 4 hours of 'lab' time, so an average 8 hour work day. Attendance is extremely mandatory these days, missing more than one day of class could get you a failing grade with very little room for make-up work or forgiveness unless you have paperwork from medical appointments. \n\nIf you do the 'extended' program for your degree, you'd be doing one class per month like the online degree. The normal full-time schedule is 2 classes per month which can be extremely demanding. \n\nAlso, not that you asked, but just pitching in my 2 cents here... Florida is not a great place to live and it's only getting worse. Politics, extremely high cost of living, lack of affordable housing... If you're already knee-deep in a degree program, please don't move your whole family for the sake of being near campus.. It's not worth it, unless you're moving for a different reason.",

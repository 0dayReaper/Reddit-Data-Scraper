    "postText": "I'm really interested in going to full sail and would like some input on the school. I have a learning disability so school is very challenging for me. I have been to college before and gen ed classes where very difficult for me. I tried to apply for Chicago Columbia college and did not get in because of my gpa and test scores are very low. I heard a lot of bad things about full sail and want to know if it's worth it for me. I have gone to community college and again I get stuck on the gen Ed's. If anyone has any idea what are my options if full sail is not worth it. Thank you.",

Like what program are you interested or what career are you looking into? Depending on what you wanna do I think full sail might be worth it. I\u2019m not sure if I can relate because I don\u2019t have a learning disability but I do have trouble staying attentive in classes but I think you can still pick up and learn the skills and info you need because the programs and labs are so hands on that you should do ok here. The instructors can be very helpful (depending on who it is) and there are plenty of student resources help and tutoring around campus if you are still struggling",

My goal is to become a director of photography, I know I would need to work my way up before that. My main reason I want to go here is that it is very hands on, this is the best why I learn.",

It DOES take making sure you're on top of your work yourself since it'll basically just be you and your laptop reminding you to work haha, but once you're past the art history type courses and get into the major-relevant stuff I feel like you'll do great. I'm in digital cinematography, which is different from the film degree but not by a ton, and it's very much a learn-by-doing type arrangement. \n\nAdditionally, there are TONS of resources constantly available for anyone struggling with learning anything, and academic advisors/ppl available to help students get stuff. \n\nBest of luck friend!",

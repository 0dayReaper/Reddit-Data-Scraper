They were either usually let go or swapped roles/students (not saying this is the case here, just my experience). I found it best to usually just email 'studentsupport@fullsail,' and they'd usually answer any questions I had or would forward it to my current advisor.\n\nBe sure to email them directly. Their 'support ticket' platform on FSO was pretty useless in my experience.",

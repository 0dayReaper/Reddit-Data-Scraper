I was thinking about doing a music theory course at another school but I can't decide. so is Full Sail University really worth the $25.5k a year?",

Definitely save money in the tuition. \n\nI earned my Associates in Music at a community college. When I applied for FullSail I skipped about 7 classes. College English, college math, psychology, public speaking, recording principles, music principles, structure of music.",

It\u2019s easy to pass classes with minimal effort, but that will likely be a disservice to yourself. \n\nIf you\u2019re a proactive student (utilizing your resources, applying what you learn to personal projects, networking, etc.), you\u2019ll be a lot more prepared when you start your career.",

If you go through getting high scores on everything and little else you'll come out with a degree but not stand out in a sea of applicants with good grades. \n\nNetwork, go above and beyond assignments to build a portfolio, (and still get good grades).",

            "comment": "I'm a bit over halfway through my program (game art - online). I've tried college classes a couple different times before coming to FS, honestly it's more or less the same as other colleges. \n\nThat being said it's fast paced, stupidly so. You need to have some major time management skills or be prepared to learn it fast. Classes are only four weeks long, and breaks and holidays can easily throw the entire month off sometimes. It's easy to lose track of time. \n\nThe others who said you get what you put in, are correct. On months where things weren't going great, outside of school, my assignments didn't turn out great. In the months where I was able to focus only on my assignments, I did some amazing work, imo. \n\nAs for those saying the teachers were bad, I can't say I share that sentiment. I've had some that I didn't necessarily agree with, but I haven't had any that were hostile to me or my other classmates.\n\nMy only bit of advice is challenging yourself when it comes to your assignments can be great, but it is way too easy to get in over your head. Sometimes it's better to do something more simple and make it look really really good.",

I feel like I was able to get the most out of the assignments. I know the first 4 classes are the basics but I\u2019m determined to do my best. I am try to stay on a strict schedule and I imagine that only gets more important as you go. Thank you for the input.",

I guess picking on nice people gets their instructors off. And I thought high school was the last I'd see of bullies....",

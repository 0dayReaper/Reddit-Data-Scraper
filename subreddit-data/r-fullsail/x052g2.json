I\u2019m interested in being a sports film maker or any film \ud83c\udfa5 aspect but I\u2019m worried I might waste $50,000+ with full sail. Is there guaranteed job after? I have already wasted $100,000 on useless bachelors degree. Also is it possible to do without debt",

            "comment": "No. No school in their right mind will ever advertise that you're guaranteed a job/career after graduation, although they do try to make their employment % look good for prospective students.\n\nIt's all down to you applying the learned skills throughout the curriculum. The university will *show* you the keys, but it's up to you to reach out &amp; grab 'em and open the door. I'm graduating in 4 months from the on-campus animation program and have a great internship lined up, but that was only possible because I'm almost 30 and *need* this to work.. I find myself putting in way more hours than my peers that are 10 years younger than me.\n\nBasically what I'm trying to say is you've gotta want it and you've gotta put the work in so you can develop a great portfolio. Your portfolio is what'll get you hired, not the piece of paper you get at the end.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to answer your question regarding debt/student loans. That's up to you and your FAFSA. Scholarships are possible, but I never sought out any because my degree is paid for via my Post 9/11 GI Bill. You'd have to talk to someone in financial aid to see what you're eligible for, but I don't think Pell grants alone would cover the cost of tuition here. It's an expensive school.",

Yes, you can download apps that allow you control some additional aspects of how your phone captures video, but a cinema camera works how you set it up to work.\n\nThen there's the image sensor, which in the FX6 is much larger than any phone's sensor.\n\nPlus the ability to change lenses to achieve different looks and depths of field (note that the iphones that have shallow depth of field do so through post-processing and they aren't perfect).\n\nDo you need something like an FX6 over an iphone? Well that depends entirely on what work you're hoping to do. \n\nWant to film videos for YouTube? Nah, stick with the phone.\n\nWant to seek out professional clients with large budgets for medium sized projects? You're going to need something closer to an FX6 than an iPhone for that.\n\n*Edit: it sorta sounds like you're wanting to stick with editing work as a job, just in the sports entertainment industry. I would suggest you'd be better off investing your time and money in a certification through Adobe or Avid. Find a local sports team, even at the high school level, and start offering to edit highlight reels for them. Build a portfolio of editing work that looks like the kind of work you'd like to get paid to do. If you want to be on location and work with filming these sports programs, not just editing them, I would suggest you start by researching what goes into these productions, because if you don't know why a filmmaker would value a camera designed exclusively to be a camera over a camera jammed into a phone body, you're not ready to take a filmmaking degree seriously.",

If you exclusively want to get a job and thats it, no real disore to go through a brutal college experience, then spend a full year applying to different jobs and making that your full time, without spending money on a tuitions that your hoping drops you a job.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Full Sail has a really strong connections department and they will do their best to help get you into the role that you want, but it all falls on you to make those first steps and send application after application.\n\nHonestly if you want to go back to school to learn, there isn't many better schools for raw information than full Sail. If you honest to God just want a job, find one.\n\nNot trying to be rude btw, I really don't want you burning 50k if your really just trying to get a job in your current field. Most community colleges have professors that have at least some sort of connections in their field of education, it might be worth your while to consider going local and seeing what happens, plus, it'll cost you way less, even if it ends up useless.",

I can tell you personally that I have lost jobs, some really good ones, because I didn't have a degree. \n\nIt's slightly different, but I've been working in IT for over a decade, back when almost no one had a degree. If they did, it was just a Bachelors. Now, people have said degree, if not a Masters. Added to that, they have certifications that many universities help them get thay are part of their degree program, and generally an internship on top of that. \n\nAgain, not the same field exactly. I'm in the game art program now, even though I do still work in IT. You will never have a promised job in life, unless if it's by a connection you make. School is far more about the relationships you build theb it is whay you learn. What separates the law program at Harvard and a state college? They both teach you what you need to know to pass the bar exam, the general knowledge is about the same. \n\nThe difference is the school, the people, the networking, and the prestige. You still want to develop your portfolio, even when going to college. You want to intern somewhere ideally, or have some type of work you can show off that was actually used in your industry. Most of the degrees that Fullsail offers are very saturated positions, making it very competitive. \n\nThat means the more you have, the better. A college degree also shows you're willing to stick with something long term (I've been told this a countless number of times). I would only recommend going to college if you're 1. 100% set on finishing it, and 2. Are actually ready to put in work. It starts easy, and builds pace. While going to school, you also want to keep learning from YouTube, udemy, and other resources too. You want to network eith teachers, snd students. \n\nA job I'm that industry is ether a business you make, or something you develop and work towards.",

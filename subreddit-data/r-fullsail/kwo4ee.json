    "postText": "im a junior in high school and im looking for a college for film. I've read that people have been told vest way to get a job in film is don't go to college all but I feel like I still would like that extra training and networking opportunities. I've heard full sail is a great place to network and the film program isn't too bad. I also know full sail cost ALOT and idk if I want to deal with that debt for along time after I attend. however I am committed to some position in the film industry and im ready to dedicate countless hours to it! if anyone is currently attending full sail for film or has attended let me know how it is or was please!",

I know a little about C# and C++ and I\u2019m continuing to watch tutorials and try and get a better grasp, but I was wondering if anyone from this course learned a good bit of these skills while taking the course that made you understand it so much more than you did in the beginning.\n\n\n\n",

The main stipulation though, is as other people said it depends on how much effort you put in...The assignments I have done so far , I\u2019m one year in, have all been pretty self explanatory but I\u2019m sure as we start to work more on our mid-term project and final project the coding will get a little more intense!....I\u2019d highly recommend the Microsoft academy learning..they have a really good tutorial on C#",

Some students only do the bare minimum and don't learn to code, others put effort into it and are strong coders by the end of the program. Ultimately it's up to you.",

If you already know a bit of C# and C++, perlenspeil will be fairly easy for you. \n\nI can't say how it has change in the last 10 years but that's what I remember.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019ve been contemplating going to full sail after my enlistment is up. But not sure if it would be for me, only because I do not have any skills with hand drawn art and have never dabbled in any programs or such for video game art, does one have to be good at hand drawing to be able to make 3D modeling and other aspects of game art??",

The idea of going through the drawing classes is to learn the principles of art because you would use them while modeling. I\u2019ve never done anything In any programs before starting computer animation and I\u2019m not struggling to much in the classes.",

Game Art was actually branched off of computer animation. Personally I want to work in games but I figured computer animation would give me a broader field to work in if games didn\u2019t work out. You should be able to go onto Full Sail\u2019s website and see what classes you take from both of them and compare to what you want.",

It is helpful tho, and you will be taking fine art classes to improve your 2D skills.\n\nI was primarily a 2D artist when I started and the only times it\u2019s been necessary was for fine art/concept art assignments.",

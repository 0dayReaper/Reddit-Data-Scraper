Chris Milanese, super nice &amp; helpful &amp; was always readily available to help if needed. Definitely the most open professor I\u2019ve had. I also didn\u2019t really think I struggled w/ presentations but this course helps with not only cementing the skills you already have but it adds a couple skills you may not have had. I know a lot of ppl had said after this course they were more comfortable giving a presentation but we\u2019re all human so jitters are normal.",

I thought I was good with presentations, but after going through the course I definitely picked up tips and skills on how to construct a successful presentation. I ended up with Heaney as my professor. She\u2019s great and hyped us up with our projects.",

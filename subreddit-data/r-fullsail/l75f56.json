Do they help you with math classes before you take the entrance exam. What classes do you start with in the game development program online. I just want some clarity of the process. As I mentioned I'm really excited for this opportunity and willing to do whatever I need to in order to succeed here",

It's going to involve a lot of critical thinking and math. It doesn't mean you can't, they just don't want you to drop out later on.\n\nHere are some random student's thoughts on the topic:\n\n[https://upcomingdev.com/blog/fullsail/full-sail-game-development-the-math-test/](https://upcomingdev.com/blog/fullsail/full-sail-game-development-the-math-test/)",

            "comment": "My recommendation is that you take a solid evaluation of your own skills before you start down this path. I was extremely confident in my math skills, took Calculus in High School, and even had some college level Trigonometry under my belt. That being said, before I started at Full Sail, my last math class was in 2012. The next 8 years were spent in the military and living life before I discovered Full Sail and decided to start this journey. When they sent me the Practice Test, it was immediately made clear that I had forgotten a lot of the math I thought I knew. Having friends in the Computer Science and Game Dev field's, I knew that math was going to be huge. \n\nMy advice:\n\nStudy. Don't blow it off and say \"I'll study later\". If you aren't positive you can ace it, then you need to study. \n\nDo not be afraid of the prep courses, if you are truly determined to get into Game Dev. They are going to help you! That being said, they are quick, down and dirty REFRESHERS. They are not exactly TEACHING Calculus, rather going over the important concepts and methods you will need to be successful. \n\nAll in all, the Math Placement test is NOT something made to deter you from a spot in the Computer Science or Game Dev Programs, but a tool to measure how successful you would be in your current state. Take it, learn from it, improve on it.\nI did the prep-courses, and they were very helpful. I am now in Month 6, fairly deep into programming and loving every minute of it.\n\nHope this helps!",

I think I'm going to have to take the remedial math classes which is what I wanted to do in the first place. I know it's going to be a hard journey ahead of me but with the right direction and the right guidance I know I can do it. I love video games and I'm really excited to learn how to build them from the ground up.",

If you have zero coding experience, find a tutorial and start learning NOW. I recommend looking on Udemy or simply YouTube. I have used GameDev.tv also, and they are extremely good. \n\nI don't work in Unreal, my experience is in Unity. Additionally, I am in the Computer Science Program, so I can't exactly speak for the path the Game Dev students take after Month 7, but up until that point the 2 Programs are the same.",

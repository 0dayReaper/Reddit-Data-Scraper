    "postText": "Soooo I'm active duty military looking to go back to school for game design and found Full Sail. \n\nI'm wondering, is there anyone else that's active duty and has a family that is doing the online course for game design that's set to be a 29 week program for a bachelors? \n\n\nHow is the work load? \n\nI've spoken with admissions and honestly the school too good to be true. They have everything moving so fast that it worries me and my wife is a little sketched out about it and I'm nervous about committing because of it. Like I called on the 20th and they're trying to get me in classes on the 30th. What're some of the things they aren't telling me of that I should be worrisome about?",

            "comment": "Full Sail sounds too good to be true because of the accreditation. They are Nationally Accredited, not Regionally like the majority of big name schools. This allows them to offer these accelerated programs because the rules are a bit different. \n\nThat being said, I have had a great experience at Full Sail, going online for Computer Science. The instructors have all been knowledgeable and very helpful. I have even made a few friends even being online, so my network is growing which is a huge point of the school.\n\nAs far as being Active Duty, that is where I would draw my concern. I spent 5 years on Active Duty with the Marine Corps, so I know how unpredictable that life can be. Full Sail is a strict schedule. They move fast, and expect you to keep up. It's not a \"slide through with little effort\" kind of school. You will be doing a fair amount of personal research on the topics, just as much if not more than it is being presented by the instructors. If you can't keep up, they will allow you to fall behind, often at additional cost to you.\n\nAnother side note, not sure how comfortable you are with coding and some higher level mathematics, but if you are I would consider Game Development as opposed to Game Design. From talking to alot of my fellow students and even to a couple friends who went to Full Sail before I did, job hunting is a lot easier with a Development degree.\n\nHopefully this helps you, feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer what I can!",

It's ridiculously expensive. I know many good state colleges that are far cheaper that offer game design. I'd look at more options, before committing this quickly.",

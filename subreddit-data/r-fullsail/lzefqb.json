    "postText": "Good Evening Redditors,\n\nI will be graduating soon with my bachelors degree in Game Design and I am wondering if anyone has gone through the game design masters degree program. I am trying to weigh my options on deciding if I should take that route or not. I am a veteran so the GI BILL will cover my schooling so I am not worried about the cost of the tuition. Things I am worried about.\n\n1. What does the course entail differently from the AA/BS program?\n2. If you have the degree, did it help you outside of school in job retention (I understand you get out what you put in)?\n3. Do you regret choosing the program or not choosing to go to the program?",

            "comment": "I am not at your point of education yet, but I have been in regular contact with people in your time frame for school. A fair number of them want to get into the field asap, but the few (and I mean few) that want to go into the master are leaning more into pursuing a career in education others (for game design and coding etc.).\n\nIf you know what you want to do once you do truly graduate, then you might have a bit of a better idea on what to do.\n\nIMO, continuing education for the sake fo learning as much as possible is good enough merit on its own, especially if your tuition is covered, but there is some drawbacks, namely you can't easily join the career force sooner.",

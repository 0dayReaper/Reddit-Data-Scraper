    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI know this is an outlandish request as we're all either students or alumni looking to simulate income from our crafts, but I'm creating a branching visual novel with a group of friends and we are in need of conceptual art in order to build a Kickstarter for funding. \n\nWe unfortunately cannot pay at the moment, but if the funding proves to be successful and we hope to build a lasting relationship with artists. We would provide you with character sheets and any other information needed, but we would have to see portfolio work of characters you've already created. This is all digital art, no 3D renders necessary. If you are interested, send me a message and I'd love to tell you more.",

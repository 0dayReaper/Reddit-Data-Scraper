Would really like to use Word on my computer instead of an iPad for my final paper in English 101, but dunno when the software is suppose to come. I checked my Junk folder as well, and nothing. Do we not get it until month 5 or what?",

Apologies for putting that so bluntly, but I speak from experience- it's not a fun time travelling down a self-inflicted panic-stricken path.  \nI also had trouble getting Adobe CC Enterprise Edition to work, but it was fixed 24 hours after I reported to tech support and my academic advisor that I didn't have my creative suite yet. When problems arise, \\*you\\* are the one expected to take initiative. But no worries, I've had nothing but splendid interactions with tech support and the advisors; they are your most trusted resources. My advice, is there is no stupid questions when talking to the advisors.  \n\n\nI wish you the best of luck on your studies, and hopefully you're able to get this sorted! I imagine getting work done without CC is painful as heck!",

From my experience as a GABS major, you are supposed to receive Adobe CC and Office 365 within the first two weeks; I was playing with apps far earlier than they were required by my courses.   \nIF there is a true error with your Full Sail account and you \\*didnt\\* get your program suites, you should have contacted your Student Advisor by phone immediately instead of \"waiting to see if they get here.\" You might harm your academic success by waiting too long to get assistance with this.\n\nWhether your questions may seem silly to you or not, NEVER be afraid to contact the advisors for help... that's their job. The worst that could happen is that they tell you your course issues the programs in later months.  \n\n\nAdditionally, \"Apache Open Office\" is a free alternative to Office 365. I use Apache's software in my personal work. In case you are forced to wait for Word, it's much nicer typing on a laptop than an iPad. It also exports files in Word format, so your instructors will have no problem viewing your work!",

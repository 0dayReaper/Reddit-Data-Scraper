    "postText": "So I applied to Full Sail starting with online classes. Without realizing it I applied for March. After submitting some fasfa and such and seeing what costs will be I realize I won't be able to afford to go at least not In the few months it will take for me to complete online courses. My parents are against loans so until we settle on another option I simply can't afford to go right now. However, advisers suggest a loan will be worth it since the field is generally high paying.  How can I respectfully tell them I need to back out?  With each day that passes I'm getting worried ill be stuck with a bill I can't afford ",

            "comment": "OP, advisors cannot force you to take loans you do not want. They definitely should not be telling you how much money you'll make. Call tomorrow, and let them know that you will be pausing (or completely cancelling) your status. Tell them you will not be starting classes, and do not want to be registered. If they refuse, escalate. \n\nIf they quote pay to you again, tell them that youd like to speak to their manager about compliance issues. They are not allowed to convince you to stay buy quoting salaries. That kind of action gives all admissions representatives a bad name, and should be stopped.",

Told the financial office can work but they're booked apparently. So,  at this point its seems best to just cancel my application all together. ",

On one hand, I can teach myself of learn for a lot cheaper then succeed and fail with little to no financial loss but on the other, I figured the school will provide professional hands-on learning, all the events I hear about ill be able to build connections with people already in the field or those about to graduate into it and can help me with my eventual job hunt making the money loss worth it.

It really varies person to person..A lot of reviews I see online say that you get what you put it in, while cliche, this is just 100% of the truth here. I definitely wouldn't rush into it, figure out exactly what you want to do, look at all your options and compare that do whatever you risk tolerance is. Good Luck!",

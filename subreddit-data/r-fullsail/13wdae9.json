Specifically from these programs:\n\n- Computer Science\n- Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence Concentration)\n- Computer Science (Mobile Development Concentration)\n\n1. Do you recommend Full Sail?\n\n2. Did you get a job in the field?\n\n3. Did employers care that you graduated from Full Sail? How did they treat you compared to someone who got their CS degree from a traditional 4-year University?\n\n4. How soon did you get your job after graduating from Full Sail?",

            "comment": "I got my degree in CS in 2019.. I took a few months off afterwards to my self. Started looking for a job 4 months later in December. Which is a terrible time to look for a job as a lot of folks take vacation. Landed a job in January started in February right before Covid. So only took a month or so.. In this field no one actually cares where you went to school at. As long as you can show you can code and can pass technical interviews your fine. Would I recommend Full Sail? Maybe.. Full Sail is incredibly expensive compared to other colleges to learn the same thing. However, One of the reasons I went to full sail is the accelerated courses. Loved the idea of being in and out in less than two years. Instead of wasting 2 additional years and summers that you wont be making money and learning stuff that you don't need at a slower pace etc . The courses are well structured and wide ranged. You learn a lot across many different technologies. You learn some app dev, systems, micro controllers, machine learning, db's, game dev and much more. If your unsure of what you want to do with software engineer I think Full Sail is great value. If you have a more narrow scope on what you want to do. You might find better value looking for bootcamps in the specified field.",

Within a few weeks, but I also was applying hard before graduation. \n\nWhen it comes to hiring IC software engineers, I do not care what school is on your degree. I care that you have a degree, I give more weight to a masters than a bachelors. Beyond this, don\u2019t care.  \n\nYou\u2019re going to get a coding test, a soft skills test, and a system design test during the interview process. I care a lot more about how you do in that, then where you learned what.",

The information I was taught could easily be learned online for free. The price of the education was not worth it. If I were to do it again I would have saved the money instead. I went there in 2010. Ask yourself if you want to go 80k in debt on a high interest student loan for 20 years. It's not worth it, trust me. Going to Full sail is not going to improve your odds. It comes down to your portfolio and how much you are practicing each day.",

They would have us use it a lot which was odd considering the price. I would just get a degree from a normal university and teach yourself the rest and get a mentor in the field.",

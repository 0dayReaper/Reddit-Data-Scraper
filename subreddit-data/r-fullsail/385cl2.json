    "postText": "So I already have a degree (unrelated field). But I'm interested about getting into the game arts, possibly animation field. I have some contacts already into that went to better known universities. \n\nI have a good knowledge about what I'm doing, looked over the courses and such too and see no issue with passing any of it. The part I'm confused about is what is the school like?\n\nAny grads have luck right out getting a job? Was it worth it? etc. I have no issue self teaching myself online, but it seems from what convos I've had most people want a degree in the field now and a well built portfolio. Each is different but looking for some general knowledge from those who have finished or put some time into the school.\n\nThanks.",

As far as jobs or portfolios, they do have a career dev. program, but really that's on the individual and how hungry they are to succeed. FS has it's own social site, and the campus is amazing. FSO connect can have you in touch with hundreds of people in related fields.\n\nI'd say it's a great school. Is it worth the money? Well how serious are you about your career? ",

            "comment": "I too am wanting to attend full sail :) I actually just got back from a tour! Okay, impressions were this...they want your money, they are a for profit college. BUT, they will give you everything you need to make a career for yourself. They give you the best equipment to work with, and the best software to use. You'll get what you're paying for basically. But the schedule will be ridiculous. 40-60 hours of school a week, the tour guide of my group told us it will be like an actual job while we're attending. Some labs go as late as even 3 AM. Most complaints come from students who don't get hired, you put 75000 dollars into a school, and you expect a well paying job when you get out. Well, if you do a half-ass job and pull As, Bs and a C, you may not get hired. A degree from this school means jack shit basically, BUT if you build your portfolio, you can go places. ",

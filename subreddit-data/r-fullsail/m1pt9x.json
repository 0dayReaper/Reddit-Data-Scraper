    "postText": "Hey everyone. I've been a Film student here for about 6 months, and love it so far. I've been looking forward to connecting with some of my classmates over zoom and campus workshops, but it seems like many have gone radio silent lol. Nonetheless, I'm reaching out to anyone on here who knows of good hiking areas in the East Orlando area. I am also looking for people who know about mushroom hunting. I'm an avid nature and portrait photographer, and would love to take photos with anyone who's interested. Reach out if you're any bit interested :)",

I\u2019ve been to the Econ River Wilderness Trail and a short distance on the Flager trail, but nowhere else yet. I would love to hear of some cool places to check out.

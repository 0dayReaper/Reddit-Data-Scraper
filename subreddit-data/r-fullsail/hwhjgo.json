    "postText": "So, I went ahead and made the decision to attend Full Sail and tackle the B.S. Computer Science program. I will be attending online, and my start date is Aug 3rd. I am very excited about this, and can't wait to start. \nI was hoping that maybe somebody on here would be able to give me more of an overview of what the program focused on. I know Full Sail is a Media/Film/Gaming focused school, and that all of their programs are somewhat tailored in the direction. I want to know how they present the Computer Science aspect of all that. \n\nI appreciate any advice/insight that can be provided!",

            "comment": "I don't know for sure, but I believe the program shares many of the Game Dev and Software Dev courses. If so, the programming, math, and some usability courses should be quite solid. It looks like the gaming specific stuff (low level graphics, game engines, game math, path-finding, etc.) is replaced with topics more generalized to a C.S. degree. So more focused on the software development cycle, quality assurance, and a more broad skill set than the other software/game/sim degrees.\n\nI'm sure you've seen it but here is the course list.  \n [https://www.fullsail.edu/degrees/computer-science-bachelor/courses](https://www.fullsail.edu/degrees/computer-science-bachelor/courses) \n\nSounds like a good time, enjoy!",

I have always had an obsession with computers(have been building my own and for my friends for years), and have wanted to get an actual education in programming since I graduated high school.",

I have gotten my associates in computer animation online already from Full Sail. \n\nMy suggestion is put in the work and then put in some more. Some professors aren't willing to help more than their scheduled time. Definitely join the Google hangout s( it may be discord now) to get help from teachers students and alumni",

I've definitely heard people say that some of the professors don't do much more then the bare minimum for the class, and I am definitely prepared to put in my Max effort. I have been using CodeCademy for the last 4 months to brush up my coding already, and I want to find some more free course I can use(YouTube and the like).",

If you spend a little more time than I did then it will be pretty stress free and more enjoyable. The classes are set up really well so far, and you always know what to do for good grades and when everything is due.",

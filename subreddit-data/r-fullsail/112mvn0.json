    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI actually applied to full sail to pursue a visual design CERTIFICATION while I also attend my community college for Psychology. You\u2019re probably like why graphic design then. Well\u2026 I have a love for art and want to be certified in graphic design so I can land a graphic design job while continuing my education in psychology. (I can handle it don\u2019t worry\u2026) \n\nI\u2019ve been in contact with full sail this week and they seem very helpful and interested in me attending the college. \n\nHowever I decided let\u2019s do some research, there\u2019s mixed reviews. Mainly leading to the negative side? Is full Sail university really that bad? Are their any other schools you would recommend for a certificate in graphic design? Are the online classes really just videos and not zoom classes?\n\n Please share everything you know about this school!",

I prefer in person. \n\nBasically what you\u2019ve got is a small\nHandful of highly happy vocal people, a small\nHandful of highly angry vocal people, and a very large pool of perfectly content graduates who say nothing. \n\nOf the angry people, I see two things that are common themes:\n\n1) I expected to only do coursework and come out prepared with a job/knowing everything without doing outside class research and work. \n\n2) the school is some way wasn\u2019t what I expected/what i was promised. \n\n\nThis is true of all schools though, you\u2019ll get out what you put in. \n\n\nOkay, all of that said, why get a certificate? I\u2019m generally opposed to certificates unless they\u2019re related to a field in which you\u2019re already employed or have a degree, on their own they are not the strongest credential for which to enter a field, and leave you slightly disadvantaged to someone with a BFA/MFA on paper.",

Like I said you really shouldn\u2019t expect the degree to get you a job, you need to be able to show off your skills in a professional manner which Full Sail has taught me to do. I really feel like most of the complaints about the school are from people who weren\u2019t willing to put in the extra work to find jobs. I was offered a job about a week ago because they saw my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, I didn\u2019t take it cause it was in a part of the US that I had no desire to move to but the opportunities are there if you\u2019re willing to work for them. Is Full Sail for everyone? Definitely not, and it is quite an expensive school but if you aren\u2019t willing to invest in yourself then you might need to rethink what it is you want to do. My initial plan was to go to MTSU but shit happens in life and the online program at Full Sail ended up being what was best for me.",

Or they wanted a week off from an accelerated class that didn\u2019t really have that option in their structure. (You have to take the whole month off, there\u2019s no time for make up work)\n\nThe classes can range from super easy to super difficult, depending on the student. \n\nI did the full degree program, but from what I was told by instructors, the certificates are portions of the degree programs. So you\u2019re taking the same classes as a full time student. I think it\u2019s very worth it. \n\nFull Sail focuses mainly on creative mindsets though, so the structure is different. And the online portions are mainly video teachings, because students aren\u2019t all gathered at the same time. I did digital cinematography, so we did a mix of linked in learning videos to learn technical programs, and videos the instructors made. \n\nI heard lots of complaints from fellow students that the program wasn\u2019t as \u201chands on\u201d as they were expecting, but that\u2019s what the campus classes are for. I thought it was a great structure as someone who worked full time. \n\nI\u2019ve been employed in the industry since I was about halfway through the program. Instructors helped me prep for the interview, and reviewed my portfolio ahead of the degree programs built in review times. I don\u2019t know if you get that same support as a certificate student - it\u2019s worth asking!",

I have had some timing issues with assignments due to life balance and this has required me to take some classes more than once. Still, even so, I do not mind paying for an extra class because what we learn is 100 PERCENT applicable to the real art world. I'm an older student that grew up in a family of artists. I am learning the finesse details of how to apply the foundations of art both in traditional and 3D. I will be shouting from the rooftops to my fellow artists that FullSail is fully worth the money invested into YOURSELF to further your own knowledge within the Game art field. Instructors are top-notch. They have worked in or are currently working in the field of the gaming and/or art world. They take their teaching seriously but are not demeaning in any way. You get an in-depth education here. Not one that just touches the surface. These folks KNOW what they are doing and the material is real-time with the current tools in the gaming world. On the fence? I say jump in! I have absolutely no regrets. This school brings my heart pure joy.-Current student online.",

When I first talked to them, I was told they have connections throughout the industry and they would find me a job upon completion of the program. When I was in my final term and I asked my career placement person for help, they were of no help. A few years after I left, they changed the name of that department to career development, when it was formerly known as career placement.\n\nI would say that the courses I took were informative and I would not say that they are fake. I do believe they're expensive and the fact that I had to use Sallie Mae (which is now Navient) to fund the majority of the tuition cost was, now looking back on it, a predatory move. \n\nI can say that I enjoyed my time there (at the time of attending) but now 16 years later I would say to my younger self to go elsewhere or don't rely on them for any help. It seems they have changed the way they do things now and I hope that is true. Just remember what you're signing on the dotted line for and be prepared for paying back a large amount of money with very little help finding a job, unless they truly have changed.",

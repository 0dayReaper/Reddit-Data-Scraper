    "postText": "Hello, I'm currently a Freshman in my first year of college and it is absolute garbage. Okok I'm exaggerating a tad bit, it's not horrible but lately, I have been feeling just completely unmotivated. The reason for that being, THESE STUPID GENERAL EDUCATION CLASSES. So, I've been eyeing this Graphic Design program because it seems like your not wasting time or money taking Maths, English, and shit. You're literally just studying what you want, Graphic Design. \n\nSo, I just wanted to come on here and see how other people are doing in this program. I've been looking around and a lot of the posts I've found regarding Graphic Design majors at Full Sail are from YEARS AGO. I just desperately need insight from people taking it currently. How is the schedule, do you have time to take breaks? Cause I've heard a negative review saying that Full Sail didn't give them any time off, (granted that post was from 2018). Is it super stressful, or just time-consuming. Because if you just need to dedicate a lot of your time, but it's at least fun. I'd rather be consumed with doing JUST Graphic Design than with all this other BS at uni.\n\nOR if you've completed the Graphic Design program recently, how has finding jobs been afterward?  Do you have a good-paying job, please tell me you do.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nUltimately I'm TIRED OF GENERAL EDUCATION CLASSES. I want to transfer to Full Sail's Graphic Design program, but there probably won't be any turning back if I do. SO, I want to be 100% it's worth it like no BS. SO PLEASE ANYONE WHO HAS OR IS CURRENTLY TAKING IT HELP ME, and if you don't mind I would love to ask questions. \n\nThanks in advance!",

Without those classes the school won\u2019t be able to give you a freaking bachelor\u2019s degree in 20 months. \n\nSooo it\u2019s not about the program you\u2019re taking or the school. It\u2019s just the law and the system. Without those \u201cgarbage\u201d classes, there won\u2019t be any \u201creal\u201d degree for you. \n\nI totally resonated(lol) with you tho. I really mean it. I had the same frustration. But knowing that the only 3 or so classes will make the other 30 or so classes not only meaningful but also credible made me think it\u2019s not a mere BS. It\u2019s GOLDEN BS.",

            "comment": "So I am not in the graphic design program, however I am in the sportscasting program, and what I will say is that there are still 2 \"general education\" classes you will have to take at Full Sail, everyone regardless of the program takes them. However depending on whether you are on campus or online, it will only make up like 1 or 2 months of your course-load. So I wouldn't worry about it too much.\n\nI was supposed to be on campus but I enrolled last March right before COVID hit. So I've been online the whole time and I'll be honest I haven't been too happy with it. At least in my program, you can put in minimal effort and still get by. I'm sure on campus is a different story, and more worth your money cause you can use all the resources the campus has to offer. \n\nIf I could give you any advice it would be to be 1000 percent sure Graphic Design and Full Sail is something you want to do before you make that decision, which it looks like you are trying to do now. Good luck!",

            "comment": "I just started the Graphic Design program today. I was able to transfer out of the 2 Gen-Ed classes by having taken them at another college. I am currently taking the Creative Presentation class and from what I can see, first week is just pretty much going over what to expect at Full Sail and how to navigate the online platform. I am doing it completely online because I\u2019m in Kansas and don\u2019t feel like dragging my wife and kids back to the east coast just for me to maybe be able to attend on campus. My old boss went to Full Sail as well for game development and she said depending on the program, it could be like working a full-time job with the hours you have to put in each week. To me, it\u2019s worth it because after this class and my second class, I will be focusing solely on graphic design. I don\u2019t really care how many hours a week I have to put into my school work to get it completed because this is what I signed up for.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about it too much, if you want to come to Full Sail for graphic design and you can see yourself doing this as a career, I say do it.",

            "comment": "I went to Full Sail years ago, and then decided to get my bachelors and attend a true four year state university. I actually appreciated my Gen Ed classes, and I think they made me better prepared for jobs down the road. I know it's hard to see that now, but honestly, there is something to those Gen Ed classes. Full Sail is super expensive for what you are getting. Basically it's a for-profit school that accepts every single applicant and fast-tracks you through a program. In my profession it's ever changing, so nothing I learned at FS stuck with me. I had to have the self-motivation to do it on my own and learn my field. There are things in my 'boring' gen-ed classes that I use to this day; I never learned that at FS. They're two completely different types of universities.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nSo March was my last month in my associates program at Full Sail. I decided I'm gonna go back for the bachelors degree and move down to winter park. I would like to get some insight on good apartments in the area you guys would recommend? When I do research online I get mixed reviews. Ideally I would like to be in a place that is furnished but I understand that might not be available. Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Most reviews for apartments are pretty polarizing because no one is out there rating the apartment complexes that are just fine. They either love them, or hate them, and given a long enough time span and a turn off of enough front-office staff, it's bound to end up being the latter sooner or later.\n\nThat said, I've lived in the area for a while and I have either lived in or known someone who has lived in just about every complex in the immediate area. A friend of mine also was just recently looking into moving into the area so I've gone on all the tours over the past 2 years or so.\n\nIf you are living by yourself, the absolute cheapest apartment you can do in good proximity in a fine neighborhood is going to be Azure. Azure offers a studio apartment that sits under $1000. It's the only one of its type. It was *my* first apartment when I went to Full Sail and I loved it, though the kitchen is very small. The bathroom is huge. There is no laundry in the studio, though.\n\nAcross the street from Azure, you have Whisper Lakes. They are a bit more expensive and they do offer a 1BR option. They have a lot of on-site laundries and many units have laundry hookups. The complex is very \"campground\" feeling if you're into that. The amenities are fine. The staff is fine. My friend ended up moving their. The only real problem she's had is her upstairs neighbor's water heater had a leak. They *sometimes* have someone checking IDs at night, but in my experience, it's inconsistent and not very effective. \n\nA bit down the road is venue, and it's probably one of the most recently remodeled complexes. They have new windows, which is big for an energy bill, but their floor plans can be a bit awkward. Their competitive with Whisper Lakes at far as price.\n\nFurther in the other direction is formerly Auvers and is now Avenue. A couple of my friends have lived there for nearly 5 years. They love the place. It's a bit more expensive and I'm not sure they offer a 1BR. The 2 bedroom is a bit weird because it's upstairs but the front door is downstairs.\n\nI've heard good things about Signal Point, and they offer some of the biggest floorplans IF you want to have roommates. They're also very expensive and perpetually full.\n\nI lived in Solis for about 5 years and I generally like it. It was fair pricing, and I think it's a bit on the higher end right now. They offer 2BR and 3BR and they're a good size. They have a gate the works occasionally...they're one of the only gated complexes in the area. We ended up leaving because we had a disagreement with the (then) property manager, but the rest of the staff was always great and the original staff was great as well.\n\nThere are smaller complexes around the area that offer really really cheap rent and, well...there's a reason for those. I can't remember their names off the top of my head but when I toured them they all had weird issues. Bad AC units. Low ceilings. Just odd stuff. If you really need a place to stay, they are a roof and doors, but not much more.\n\nOynx is fine. Recently remodeled. A bit more expensive. Nice grounds. I only did the tour and haven't known anyone to ever live there, so I can't speak much for the front-office staff.\n\nSapphire *looks* really nice outside, but I've heard nothing but bad things about them. The buildings apparently have a shared water bill? So if your neighbor uses a lot of water you fit the bill. Some units were unfinished remodels and some people had to live in their units while they were being remodeled and they took forever to finish? It could be different now but I haven't heard anything that would make me want to consider them when there are so many other options around.\n\nThese are some of the notes I made when my friend was looking about 2 years ago, things may have changed now obviously, but you can get the gist of it:\n\n https://imgur.com/euMsh4L",

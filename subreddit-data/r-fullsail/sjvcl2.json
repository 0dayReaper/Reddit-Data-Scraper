            "comment": "I can't speak from personal experience, I'm in an extremely fortunate situation of not having to pay out of pocket for school or basic living expenses here in central FL. Retelling accounts from peers on-campus, a decent majority of students do manage to juggle a part-time job while attending but it's a struggle.\n\nThe university is pretty much built around the concept of \"this is your full-time job while you're here,\" with the exception of an occasional work-study job available. Many students start with a part-time job like Wawa or Publix due to their potential flexibility around a revolving monthly schedule, but.. I think you'll find a lot more students tend to live off of either student loans or funds from family.",

The best way of working is doing something like door dash, Instacart, Uber, stuff like that.\n\nJobs around the school usually turn down students so they don't have to deal with a bunch of employees only doing small hours.\n\nJust try to find one that is as flexible as possible.",

It's for profit. You will be in copious amounts of debt and unless you're genuinely talented you won't get a good job in your field through them. This will not change or improve your life. Save your money go to a local community college. There are a ton of resources that can help you learn your intended trade.\nYou'll hear a lot of students say you'll get out what you put in. What you're putting in is approximately $60,000 for a sub par education. It's a debt trap.",

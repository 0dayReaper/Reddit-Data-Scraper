I'd like to submit my second week assignments, but I haven't been graded on anything yet. It's hard to know if I need to improve on something. If they were 8 or 16 week classes, it wouldn't bother me as much.",

I've had my assignments graded almost immediately because the teacher was really efficient when grading, but I've also had a class or two where the teachers would literally not grade till the very last week in spite of the fact that they were asked to check out my assignments earlier.",

The latest I've ever seen is thrusday and that was a sciene course I was taking. Most art courses/more towards my degree I see the teachers grade better.",

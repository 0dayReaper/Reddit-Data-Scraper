    "postText": "Hello! I'm thinking about applying to Full Sail Uni for Game Art and wanted current students thoughts about the school. I have done some research and from what I gathered... there was a large amount of debt some of them were in and most graduates were viewed as underqualified by companies they wanted to work for. \n\nMay be kind of useless to ask, but I am curious. How is the school so far for you? What would you rate it?",

So then if you\u2019re already proficient the most value FS provides is focus on learning current industry tech and networking. If you are highly self driven you can save yourself 50k by self learning. But that could be said about any degree program really.",

All most companies are looking for is your knowledge, experience, and your personality. A degree is a degree, but that just means you did well in school. They want to know you can handle real work application of your skills.\n\nAs with any private school, yes, there\u2019s debt, but what FS was great for is developing networking opportunities. The entertainment industry is massive, but also very intimate. Knowing the right people will get you work. That includes the professors and students.",

However they will teach you all of the technical skills you need to make game art and be proficient in a pipeline. \nSo keep that in mind, if you arent already an artist, you WILL need to develop those skills as well. \nI also left with very little debt, most students qualify for a ton of grants from the school and you can drastically reduce the price of you education by writing a few short essays and just applying for things.",

There are plenty of jobs in games that dont require you to be picasso, but if you want to make art for games you definitely have to be a great artist.\n\nThat being said its just as easy to learn to be an artist as anything else, it just takes drive and commitment to the craft. And since the ceiling on skill is so high for visual arts it can take a good long while to develop even at a strong pace to professional quality. If you really want to make games, and specifically art for the games, then you will do it. Your passions and talent may lie elsewhere in the industry though, so take your time and research the different jobs available and what they actually require of you. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL42m9XiTqPHJdJuVXO6Vf5ta5D07peiVx\n\nthese videos by RIOT are a great way to see what actually goes into these jobs.",

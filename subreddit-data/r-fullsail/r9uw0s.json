    "postText": "   Yesterday I had a student respond to my post and he basically corrected everything or he thought he did so. For example, he said the assignment included both dialogue AND inner thoughts and that I didn't do the inner thoughts (he was wrong I did) and that I did the inner thoughts wrong again he was wrong he said inner thought is first pov is in quotes, no their italicized. However, because he was so aggressive I second guessed myself and made all the changes but the instructor saw it and was like nooooooo! Change it back. She had told me that for one he was wrong in the way he \"spoke\" to me and to always go to the instructor for confirmation, she even said that she didn't like discussions because you always get that one, \"Snobby prick\" who finds a target because they think they're better writers when they're on the same level. I think she said that because it's a rule in creative writing to make sure your tone is in its correct position. Saying AND made it seem like I didn't pay attention and just simply aggressive towards me. I always try to be nice when giving constructive criticism and I always take in others thoughts seriously. I was just wondering if they get punished and wanted to tell you guys it's not just the students that hates discussions.",

You may never know exactly how hard it affected the other person, but honestly, I wouldn't worry about it. Especially if you received the message you did from your instructor or professor.\n\nAs well just as a bit of advice. Remember, constructive criticism is just a suggestion. In the end, it's up to you to determine its true merits in reference to your works. No matter what they are. Probably one of the harder things to get used to with creative writing. Because it's so cerebral, it is very personal and can open us up to listening to bad or wrong advice. I've had a few friends battle with that. The same thing happens in visual arts as well. I can't name how many times I've stopped someone from ruining a perfectly good piece because someone wants to be that snobby prick.l, and they almost listened.\n\nI'm very much of the mind, learn the rules so you can break the rules, and tell everyone else to f*ck off. \n(Pause for comedic timing)\nUnless it's your job/commissioned/piece work, then. The client/boss is god and just give them whatever they want. Lol\n\nSorry to hear people are being dick bags. Good luck!\n\n*edited for corrections because my phone sucks lol*",

While this student may not have intentionally meant to come across rude, or they did, they will be reminded it isn\u2019t tolerated. So hopefully this situation was a nice learning experience for everyone. Cheers.",

Most people are generally neutral and careful not to offend one another uselessly. I quite literally always compliment first, and compliment in closing just after suggesting what could be better.",

Its really annoying when people give attitude like their the professor, but yet their in the same class. Amazing.",

Sometimes people need to flex in order to feel superior, but only if they feel at risk of being inferior. It\u2019s just how it is. And I would have definitely been annoyed. Goodluck the rest of the way though, and don\u2019t let them get to you.",

    "postText": "Hi guys So I enrolled and I start classes in January, however my fasfa is not enough to pay for full sail and I was told by an adviser to seek out private loans as an alternative. The issue I am having atm is I am getting declined left and right even with a good credit score I also even have a co signer. I think last time I looked I was trying to pull a loan of 33137$ thats included living expenses for 8 months. How is it I see people left and right getting in but I cannot. I know for a fact a few people had gotten in with bad credit and no co signer how is that even possible?",

            "comment": "I think it depends on where you're getting your loan from. Personal bank? Federal loan? Private loan? I know banks will turn people down left and right, but I've rarely seen federal and private loans turn people down because they charge outrageous interest.\nPeople also might be getting in a lot more because they're not paying for living expenses, and have less to need a loan for. If you have any friends in the Orlando area, maybe room with them? Work a part time? ",

But they do have other ones for freshman etc.\n\nOr try unigo. I've gotten several scholarships through them but be prepared for a lot of essays (I must have wrote like 40+ essays and was only awarded 5 scholarships but they ended up helping me out $7,500)",

    "postText": "Hi, I am currently interested in attending Full Sail and was wondering if anyone had any knowledge or experience they can share with me. I currently live in Wisconsin and have been interested in this school. I have an associates degree in business from my local college and want to further into an entertainment business bachelors degree. \n\nHere are some of the questions I have.\n\n1. How do people afford paying rent while attending Full Sail? Do you have a job and attend school? Or have you saved up money over time to pay rent? \n\n2. Do you get a summer vacation? Or do you go for 12 months? \n\n3. Is a normal day 8 hours like a normal job? \n\nI think those are my main questions that I have not found clear answers for yet. If anyone reads this I would greatly appreciate a response. \n\nTHANKS! ",

It\u2019s called the extended program, it take a few more months to graduate, but:\n1. It\u2019s cheaper \n2. Allows you to network more\n3. It\u2019s easier to schedule a job around it. \n",

            "comment": "Are you planning to come to campus or attend online? Either way, if you are expecting to pay for rent through financial aid alone then you will likely not be able to do so unless you get approved for a private loan or a Parent PLUS loan \\(if you are a dependent student under 24 years old\\). Campus students sometimes struggle to find work not because there is a lack of jobs in the area but because their schedule changes every month and employers don't like to be that flexible.\n\nIf you are an online student, you should not expect to pay your rent through financial aid because your cap on how much you can receive will be lower anyway, so I would recommend that you plan to have a job.",

I currently have an associates degree in business management and the LA film school will accept my associates and will also only take me 2 years to get a bachelors. But rent is much more expensive in the LA area. \n\nThanks for all the comments though. I have a lot to look over! ",

            "comment": "My first year of full sail I paid for it out of student loans. Apartments were cheaper in 2015 though. It was $725/month for a 1 bedroom. That same complex is $900/month now. Totally not worth it. My second year I rented a 3 bedroom house with 2 other people. That brought it down to about 500/month depending on electric and water usage. I suggest looking for roommates. Full Sail will give you a list of students starting around your start time. Sometimes it's really hard to find someone, so I would suggest looking for a roommate that's already here. Craigslist has a lot of listings for the UCF (neighboring school) and full sail area. There is also UCF and Full Sail Facebook pages to connect with people. \n\nNo summer vacation, Full Sail is year round. That's what makes it a 2 year bachelor's. There is a 1 week break in July, and a 2 week break in December. \n\nYou will typically have a 2 or 4 hour lecture (depending on program) ask your addmisions rep which one. Labs are 4 hours and can typically start at 1pm, 5pm, or 9pm. There will be different lab groups. The times may differ if you have 2 hour lectures. But it won't always be 8 hours trait through, and you won't have lab every day. \n\nHope this helps. You should take a tour if you haven't already. It's run by students so you can get a full picture of what life will be like on campus. Ask lots of questions!",

            "comment": "I was an on campus student. I paid my first year with Student Loans and at the same time did work study. You can start work study at month 3. Its up to 25 hours a week and usually min wage. My entire second year got roommates and paid it with work study. \n\nThere are a few fast food places and a plublix super market that hire Full Sail students and will work around their schedule. Scheduling around classes is really difficult. Its possible to pay rent with out loans but also difficult. Try to get a 3 bed with roommates, and don't eat out and it should be easier. Good luck ",

They only see full sail students as easy money. It is all the typical bills associated. Most don't include any utilities. If this will be your first apartment, when budgeting remember that internet, electricity, renters insurance (and sometimes water and trash) are all separate bills. I paid $750/month for my first 1 BR apartment in 2014. About $1,000 a month after utilities. That same apartment complex is up to $950 a month. The bills rack up fast, even faster with student loan interest. \n\nThere are a few places that are \"all included\" utilities but they upcharge for the convenience and sometimes have usage limits. Watch out for prices, 1 bedrooms are really expensive right now, explore all your options. ",

            "comment": "The best advice I can give is you get out what you put in.  I went through the Animation program and had an amazing time and learned a lot.  That\u2019s only because I decided to focus all my efforts on the classes.  You\u2019ll have some amazing and interesting classes and then you\u2019ll also have classes that you won\u2019t be so fond of.\n\nGetting value out of Full Sail is all about going the extra mile, and if you do you\u2019ll be highly rewarded.  But I met lots of talented people that were my classmates that have struggled finding industry jobs post graduation because they simply didn\u2019t put in the effort.  You\u2019ll be entering a highly competitive field and you\u2019ll need to do anything you can to stand out.  And if you make good impressions on your professors many of them will go out of their way to help you.\n\nTake opportunities to start extra curricular projects with your friends and classmates.  Start designing things outside of the curriculum and bring them to your teachers for guidance.  Full Sail can be brutal sometimes due to time constraints on course, but you\u2019ll find you have plenty of time outside of class to work.  So in essence - give it your all and you\u2019ll reap the benefits.  Feel free to PM me if you have any more specific questions about the school or it\u2019s programs",

You can pretty easily get by on knowledge but to truly succeed you have to put yourself and your work out there make connections. In my class this week we are trying to have a first piece of writing published. The classes move quickly make sure you use all the rescuers available to you! You got this!!",

The teachers don't know how to run a class, and there is literally no support system for testing out or applying actual work experience credit hours.\n\nIf you're going here expecting anything more than the degree itself, don't.",

Not from lectures, or books. Only one of my classes so far (in on month 8) had a book that we had to use. Otherwise its just junk. The portfolio's class I'm in right now is the first one I am learning anything in but besides the assignments, the instructors are encouraging us to look everything up. I've had them tell me they can't take the time to help me and to ask my classmates, how are 50 some struggling kids going to be able to answer my questions. I just don't know how I feel about it right now in terms of getting a lot out of it. For sure work on side projects, start looking up tutorial videos yourself in your free time, group up with others no matter how much you don't want to talk to anyone. It is the most important, start working on side projects, and out of school projects and make your portfolio better than anyone else who graduates from there because they are who you are up against in the future. Feel free to dm with any questions or if anyone wants to work on anything with me :)",

It's going to be hard, probably one of the hardest things you've ever done in your life. I did this program after obtaining a computer science degree and it was still very hard, but if you are really passionate about this field you will take the time and effort to succeed in this. To me the day I got my first job after going through this was worth it.",

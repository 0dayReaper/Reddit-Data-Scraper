            "comment": "Honestly just tell the teacher. If they don't do anything, go to the program director, since they are effectively the teachers bosses.\n\nFair warning though, going to the course director paints a target on your teachers back, only do it if you really have proof since it all turns into a game of tatle tale.\n \nIn the midterm project for game dev/ simulation and visualization, I had 2 group members who were stealing my work and claiming it as their own in spite of the fact that you could use github and visual studios log checker to see it was my work, and my teachers really didn't do anything about it. I brought it up to the course director and explained the situation, especially since they were causing huge problems in our project whenever they did actually submit something (crashing everyone's unity due to mismatched versions, rolling back 2 weeks of progress irriversably, etc), and the teachers still really didn't do anything, and those 2 students passed the classes using work that was straight up not theirs. \n\nSometimes that's just how it goes, and it's infuriating especially when your pouring your heart and soul into your projects and trying your ass off to pass, while you watch your group project members sit in class/lab watching YouTube on their phone and literally leaving lecture halfway through since they were bored and wanted to go smoke weed (this happened, they were talking about it out loud, it pissed a lot of people off). I have been pissed about the situation and will likely hold onto that anger for a while, but thanks to outlets like talking about it to other people who have passed the class and teachers who have worked in job settings with people like that let me get a better bigger picture perspective on it. It's going to nag me for a while, but I'm moving slowly onto bigger more important things, like not caring about stuff like that anymore.\n\nHope this helps you with your situation, remember to look out for yourself first and foremost, since you should be the most important person in your life. Take care",

This was due to a combination of the school finally going back to more normal (on campus classes), as well as the general lack of apartment/ housing available due to the very sudden influx of students.\n\nIt was a very wierd time where the 2 members on my group project could just barely get through the class, granted they were placed on the academic watch list due to it, so very lucky for them I guess.\n\nLike I said, I don't really care about going after it even if there is blood in the water, I literally have a hundred better things to do",

However I never cared enough to report anyone when I was there and left before I was able to get to know people at full sail that had any authority. I was smarter than most of my teachers who seemed like they were all hired off of fivver. So I\u2019m not entirely sure. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d need proof and a paper trail. That\u2019s a mighty big claim. Administration might be able to do something but if you know what class it\u2019s for I\u2019d say maybe go to the teacher. If you\u2019re contacting them multiple times with no reply it\u2019s likely they don\u2019t/can\u2019t/won\u2019t get involved. I\u2019m sure they can just be busy. As it\u2019s winter time and holidays are always making people be lazy till at least March but I\u2019d say if this has been going on for a bit and no resolution is in sight. Not much else can be done unless you go to the very absolute top. I\u2019m sure this is going to be a long drawn out process but as the other poster said. I\u2019m sure full sail cares more about tuition then having not tuition. So in a capitalistic society. You\u2019re sadly up to bat against a team who\u2019s automatically going to win the World Series. I wish you the best in bringing sweet justice to the kid. However you\u2019re likely just looking into the darkness. I\u2019d say if I were you I\u2019d worry about you and just pray for karma. Kids not going to know what to do when he graduates if he didn\u2019t learn anything ya know?",

Like as far as the music program went. No one takes me seriously. Full sail back in the day was like the cats meow for recording and music production. Now it seems like it\u2019s another quick cash grab. Like I was 1 1/2 years into the 2 year program. Eventually ended up getting credits transferred and stuff out to get a degree. However it didn\u2019t matter. I learned virtually nothing in the time I was there and don\u2019t consider it college. A total waste of 50k. That being said. I\u2019d never recommend them and think they\u2019re a joke. As you said not a university. \n\nWhen I went. I missed days and never even got counted tarty or late or missing or anything like that. They recorded I was there lol even after I was like hey I\u2019ll be gone for 6 days due to a family thingy. They just ignored it and credited me for it anyways.",

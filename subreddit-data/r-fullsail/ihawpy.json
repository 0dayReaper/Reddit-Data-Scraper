    "postText": "Hi everyone! \n\nI\u2019ve recently been working with zbrush, and find myself super interested in searching for more of an education within the field. \n\nI went to Emerson college and graduated in 2018 with a bachelors in film/tv production. I thought this would be a great route to expand my horizons within the vastly expanding entertainment industry.\n\nThe certification program for 3d art sounds great, but I would like some more opinions before I opt into it.\n\nThanks so much!",

But if I was to break down how school each month your learning something new it\u2019s literally up to you take the information and what ever is you learned and expand on it. They offer great information and sources to help  further your skills. They offer a great post grad program to help you stay connected to the industry.",

    "postText": "Hello! So I just got off the phone with someone who said they were from the university, and they helped me go through the entire application and the 'todo' part of my account. I have a GPA currently of 3.0 and an ACT of either 26 or 27 (i dont have the paper so it's either one of those numbers but i think it's 26).  \nI'm going in for the Game design focusing in art, although I'd also love to take the more general course of looking at how games are made overall? But I also don't live there, so i have several questions.  \n1. How did you afford the apartments?  \nI know they don't have typical dorms, but they have apartments close by. Were these included in the price as like a normal dorming fee, or was it like rent where you have to pay monthly like regular? If they're monthly, how did you pay for them?   \n2. What are some pros about going there?  \nI've been looking at Southern California as well in terms of schooling, so what are some things that make Full Sail special?  \n3. What are some cons about going to Full Sail?",

Unfortunately this isn't the best place to seek advice regarding Full Sail, despite that being the purpose of this subreddit. \n\nYou're gonna find nothing but people who attended with immensely naive expectations. This is essentially a graveyard subreddit of people saying \"should i..\" and the answer is usually always \"no.\"",

Studios these days are trying to negate the degree requirements and letting portfolios speak for themselves. I'm currently attending on-campus but simply because I know this is the best way for me to learn- with stucture and deadlines. \n\nYou get what you put in is true to an extent. There are people that graduate top of their class but then can't get a job. And here is my two cents on that:\n\nFuck your GPA, if at the end of the day you're only doing the bare minimum and following step-by-step instructions for assignments for a good grade, you're not doing yourself any favors. What recruiters wanna see is a stellar portfolio. Literally no one will ever care that you got a 4.0 from any art school/trade school.",

            "comment": "I almost never chime into these threads but I can't sleep right now and figured why not for once. There's a lot of mixed opinions about the Full Sail experience online, but I'm just gonna base everything here off of my own journey and what I saw along the way.\n\nTo quickly answer your first question since my wall of text will get into the other two, I went all in and just maxed out my living expenses loans. I'm sure the numbers are different these days, but it was plenty to live comfortably at one of the many apartment complexes nearby campus. They are just apartments though, so you'll be living around plenty of non students and you're responsible for keeping yourself alive and maintained haha. You'll probably want a car or at least have some friends willing to help you with things like groceries and getting to school, but if you live at one of the really nearby places you can manage without. I decided to live alone but it's fairly easy and common to find other Full Sail students as room mates. I also knew people that did the non accelerated program and worked a part time job to help ease the total cost. If you can do that and earn some good scholarships, I think it's actually possible to come out with fairly manageable debt. Anyway, onto the main details:\n\nI graduated in December 2015 and did the game development program, so I can really only speak for that. Since then, I've had two proper fulltime jobs as a software engineer. My first was in flight simulation and my second was at Unity itself. It's certainly possible to succeed but the harsh reality is that it's a very sink or swim environment.\n\nAs humbly as I can say this, I'm smart and have a good work ethic and Full Sail was a good environment to flex in. I managed to pass every class while on the accelerated 2 year program (besides some English class I had during final project while I was working on networking code, which I retook and passed the next month.) Sure, it's possible to drag your feet and do the bare minimum and still somehow pass, but if you're passionate and really take it seriously you'll pickup a lot of useful skills along the way.\n\nFor example, I think the best experience was the hands on team projects. I had to make a 2D game halfway through the program on a team of 5, and then a 3D game for final project on a team of 6, each taking a few months. On top of learning the raw technical skills needed to make the games work, I learned the basics of operating as a team and support things like source control. It was good hands on work and I felt prepared when I started my first job. The other various classes were hit or miss. Some of the teachers are geniuses like you can't imagine and you'll learn A LOT. But some classes are total nonsense lol. This is also going to vary a lot between different programs so it's hard to say what your experience may be like. Just make sure that you get a lot of hands on work, and not bullshit like online pre recorded lectures and vague/easy projects to do by yourself. And honestly, I'm not sure how strict they've been about in person classes during covid but if you can't get a chance to learn in person I'd say don't even bother or just wait till things are normal.\n\nHowever, to really succeed you can't just do good in the classes, you have to really be passionate for what you're going in for and naturally want to go the extra mile. A lot of people who I saw fail miserably and waste a fuck ton of their time and money were morons who just played video games growing up and thought it would be fun/easy to make them, having done no preparation all the way up until the core programming classes start. I've been working on making games since middle school using Game Maker for fun in my spare time. In high school I really learned how to program and messed around with XNA and Minecraft mods. This meant that by the time I was taking the fast paced courses, I wasn't struggling with the masses who have never worked with code in their life. My focus and energy went towards learning how to make games. I was doing all the random shit I could, usually game jams the school would throw on occasion, but my buddies and I got lucky and managed to even get on some weird ass game jam YouTube reality show thing haha. You can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92k9y-BIP1w), I'm Mike from team Red Duck. We didn't win, but we all got a free game! On top of all this I was making sure to have a real beefy resume. The school advised you to have at least 2 game projects, my friend had an idea to stand out and said to aim for 3, I'm competitive and decided on 4. And most importantly I managed to deliver on them. If you want to check that out [here](https://msciortino17.wixsite.com/portfolio), it's mostly unchanged other than keeping the info up to date and swapping old games I've made with newer ones. You'll definitely want a website like this with some projects you're proud of by the time you graduate. At both of the jobs I got, people involved with hiring me afterwards told me they viewed the website and probably would have ignored me if I didn't have one or they weren't impressed.\n\nI'm not trying to brag or flex with all this, I'm trying to make clear how much you'll have to really work your butt off because everyone who didn't have this mentality stalled out. Retaking classes and over longer periods of time meant owing much more money in the end, on top of not really being ready to work in the industry to pay that debt off. One guy I knew, went through the entire RA program, decided to transfer the final month to game dev, needed to do non accelerated and even then often failed and retook classes. All on top of maxing out living expenses! His team's final project was a bit of a disaster, and after looking him up on linkedin out of curiosity a few years after graduating, he was working at best buy. I honestly feel very bad because he was a kind hearted guy and I wished him well. But there's a lesson to be learned here and I advise you honestly ask yourself how you think it'll play out once you make the deal with the devil and enroll. This certainly isn't a zero sum game, I believe if everyone performed well there'd be a lot more opportunity in general. But I do know all of our stories and circumstances are different. If you feel you're in a strong position to get this ball rolling, you'll probably do fairly well.\n\nThat takes me to the last point that's worth discussing and that's the insane tuition price. In hindsight, as awesome as the experience was the price just doesn't seem worth it. I'm very fortunate that I've been able to keep up with the debt but it feels like such a burden on me. I can't imagine the nightmare of owing this many **private** loans (meaning I've had to keep making payments even though all federal loans got relief during covid, plus I'm being robbed with the interest rates) and NOT having means to pay it off. I don't have regrets about my choices, like I said my path ended up working out fairly well. In fact I recently took the plunge as an indie developer! I've also had some of my most fun experiences with friends during my time there. But as a slightly more jaded and not as young man, I wish I could somehow let 18 year old me know what nearly $100,000 of debt could feel like since it was just some number to me at the time.\n\nSo yeah, where does that leave you? The Game Development program was tough, but if you passed then at least you were a programmer and that gave you some options. Any chance you'd consider development instead? I don't think Game Design is going to give you many practical skills unless you land a very specific kind of job as a designer. It really depends on what your long term plans and goals are if that's a good or bad thing. From my few interactions with design students, it just seemed like a more watered and dumbed down program. You'll have a much better chance of landing a good job if you learn how to make the games yourself, design some personal projects, and actually bring them to life for your portfolio. Art gives you some more options, like at animation studios, but it's quite a different path since you're very restricted into a specific type of skill. Developers can improv assets or just buy them and still make the whole game themselves. But an artist needs to find a developer to work with to make a game. Plus these kinds of jobs are in very few supply and competition is extremely fierce. This doesn't mean it's impossible, (especially if you're brave enough to free lance or go indie) but you need to be ready to honestly put your heart and soul into this to make it work just to stand a chance. Please honestly ask yourself if you can do that and understand the cost involved no matter the outcome. \n\nIn the end, it's simply up to you to decide. I think just the fact that you're doing research like this before signing up already puts you ahead of most which is a good sign. I hope I haven't been too discouraging haha, the nice thing is it's fairly easy to start small and feel things out before you bite off more than you can chew. If you're just at the point where you're testing out the waters, I say at the very least take some time (a decent amount if need be, don't burn yourself out and rush in just a few days, new classes start monthly so you can begin whenever you're ready) before you sign up and do [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR5QFsefuO2RlAgWEz6EvVi6) Unity basics tutorial and then spend some time getting creative. By the end of it you should have a good feel if this could be a path for you, but you won't be in crazy debt. If that didn't scare you away, Full Sail could be a great time! Feel free to message me if you had any other questions! Sorry if it became very rambly, I did a lot of rereading and editing and it's a bit of a mess now, but it was very fun to write!",

I like that the curriculum so far is pretty open/not as many constraints as a typical university... it allows more expression in my opinion. Yea, I mean it's not as bad as people make it out to be and it's not some magic wand where everything lines up swimmingly for you after you complete. I'm in digital cinematography btw.",

            "comment": "Nope! Let me just be honest here. I graduated way back in 1995. It was far cheaper then, however, expensive compared to other colleges. Here's what I learned after going there:\n\n\\- It's a FOR PROFIT school! You should be apprehensive of any school that has their own best interests at stake before yours. \n\n\\- It's not regionally accredited, which means it's credits and hours don't mean crap at other college. \n\n\\- It's a glamorized trade school.\n\n\\- It's a diploma mill. Full Sail has been pumping out diplomas monthly for well over 30 years. They are graduating TONS and TONS of people who are flooding into industries that are already over saturated with workers. \n\n\\- When hiring, NO ONE will know what the fuck school you went to. Go to any other state college in this country, you will have employers who respect that MUCH more than a diploma mill. Full Sail just isn't looked at seriously. Hell, I don't even bother to put it on my resume.\n\n\\- WAY overpriced! Sure you get to play with the latest toys they have there, however, technology changes rapidly. Everything you learn there will be obsolete in a couple years. You're paying a premium to play with the latest technology that will soon be changing. \n\n\\- Full Sail graduates are at 21% chance of defaulting on their loans vs 7% for those that attend a state university. \n\n\\- The jobs you will often get coming out of Full Sail are incredibly low paying. Like, ridiculously so (probably explains the high default rate on student loans). \n\n\\- The inner workings of that school is gross. I knew of so much shady shit that went on when I was there...lots of  instructors/students relationships, special privileges or free tuition for students that had parents of clout, big time drug parties amongst the founders and all the higher staff, among other things.",

Trust me, if I could talk to my 18 year old self again, I'd smack her up the side of her head and warn her of the poor decisions she is about to make. That said, those poor decisions led me to make many good decisions, so there is that. ;-) There are great aspects of Full Sail, however, it is not worth taking on that amount of debt. That's all! I'm very good at managing my money and have learned a lot over these years, this is simply not worth the risk.",

FS has accepted transfer credits from basically every school someone come from based on class code/description. In terms of apartments best best is to live as close as possible to save gas etc. and utilize a combo of working p/t and FA just need to show your potential employer your schedule every 3rd week of the month. Also you can do extended track for 29 months for more flexibility in learning",

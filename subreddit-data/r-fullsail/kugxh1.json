            "comment": "The problem with Full Sail is that it's not regionally accredited, which is actually MORE important than nationally accredited. It needs to be regionally accredited in order for the degree to be recognized by other universities. I graduated from Full Sail years ago and got the associates, but those credits never transferred to another university where I wanted to get my Bachelors. Basically I had to start over. This is a common complaint of alums who attend universities after Full Sail. Sad but true. Sorry.",

It's frustrating and I wish I had looked into the difference before... Not that I didn't love Full Sail or anything. Just annoying that because they don't pay the right people we get shafted.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am considering attending Full Sail.  I was just curious what the average cost of tuition is to attend?  Right now I am studying online and paying around $10,000 per year which is stretching my finances already.  Also, does anyone know if Full Sail is regionally accredited?  Thanks!",

            "comment": "I'm a show production student at Full Sail. The tuition is expensive at about $40,000 a year (without scholarships or financial aid, which most students receive), but it's a 2 year degree program, which makes the cost comparable to a normal 4 year private, non profit institution (usually around $20,000 a year, if not more). Full Sail isn't regionally accredited, but the point of going to school at Full Sail is that you're learning the newest, most up to date curriculum possible, which is difficult to do when an institution is hindered by the requirements of regional accreditation. If you aren't someone with drive to make it in the entertainment media industry, Full Sail is not for you. There is a very rigorous schedule that changes every month, which makes it almost impossible to hold down a job or have an active social life. That being said, the rigorous coursework and class time is only the bare minimum required to graduate from Full Sail. If you really want to be successful and get out the most that you can from the program, you must also spend a lot of time working on non-graded work. There are many options for extra ways to get around campus, and the school is usually pretty good at letting people know about what's going on in the area off campus as well.",

If getting an online education hampered by the constraints of accreditation and an inability to truly network in person with others in your field is okay with you, go with that.",

I've learned this many times over.\n\nHarvard's tuition is about $7,000 more per year.\n\nThe accreditation constraint you seem to downplay is a very big deal and severely outweighs the \"networking\" aspect.  Maybe not when you are a producer or an actor/actress, but a technical degree, yeah definitely want to make sure it's regionally accredited.  My last two jobs required a regionally accredited degree and spoke nothing of experience.  This means that if my existing Associate's degree would have been only nationally accredited, then I probably wouldn't be working today.",

Comes to a total of about $188,000, more than double Full Sail's $80,000 tuition. Don't underestimate the power of getting jobs from the people you know. If you go to Full Sail, the education is geared toward the entertainment industry, even if you choose a technical field. If you aren't passionate about having a career in the entertainment industry, Full Sail isn't for you.",

Lynda itself is a great learning resource and went pretty in-depth for the subjects I was learning about.

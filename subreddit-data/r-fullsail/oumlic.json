But if he's someone who easily give up on things don't do it. FullSail has been great to me. I started when my son was 1 and had another boy half way through my program and still graduated while staying in the honor society. Lots of resources and help. Lots of great people",

            "comment": "I am still a current student at Full Sail, and not in Game Dev.\n\nHowever, I have two friends of mine that graduated from Full Sails Game Dev program, and one now works at Ubisoft and was credited on the last Assassin's Creed game and the other works for Blizzard on World of Warcraft. The program is legit if you are willing to put in the effort. I am a Computer Science student and the first half of our program is the same as Game Dev. It is not easy. The workload is heavy even online, and if you don't stay on top of it you can fall behind fast.\n\nOverall, if he is truly set on a career in Game Dev, Full Sail is an amazing option that should be considered.",

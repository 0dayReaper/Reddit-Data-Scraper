Regardless, there are some options: find a room first, then find a room mate on the housing list. There are very few apartments walking distance from full Sail that have studios, so get on your search hard right now.",

However, the prices in the spreadsheet will likely be $500-800 more expensive than what's listed because rent in Orlando is absolutely atrocious.\n\nYou should also get in contact with Full Sail's housing office as they are a great resource.",

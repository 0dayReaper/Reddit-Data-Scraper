I am hoping it will. Does anyone have any suggestions since everyone is going online which already had due to COVID. Its going to be difficult finding jobs I'm sure. Even harder then it was before. This Game Design is such a competition too. Any thoughts on all this?",

I've wanted to do game design since I was 7 years old, before I knew it was even a word for it. I am 32 now and I graduated Feb this year for it, I barely passed but I did it, now I work in the security industry and I do game design on the side. I plan on going online for my Master's when I have time, and to be honest after all the competing and struggling it was worth it because in the end, I achieved the foundation that I wanted. I can now make small games with decent mechanics on my off time and as long as I stay serious, that knowledge will grow and I won't even notice it.\n\nYou have to really want to be in the field, that's why it's a career and not just some side gig, you're speaking about the thing you'll be doing for the rest of your life, you have to either decide you're all in for the risks or change the field, you'll either have my desire or you'll get passed up, that's life but I wish you all the best. \ud83d\udcaa",

When i first saw the Math, I was like holy crap! I haven't done Math since High School and that was a long time ago! It does take me a lot longer to take in the Information and watch the videos like ten times to understand it!! As of right now, I am still passing the course in Math so I am trucking along! Thanks again!",

Put the headphones on and have the kids playing video games or something while I just sit there and learn the stuff. It took awhile but I am actually getting it and i doubted myself in the beginning which I'm sure a lot of people do. I need to not do that crap! Thank you for the advice!",

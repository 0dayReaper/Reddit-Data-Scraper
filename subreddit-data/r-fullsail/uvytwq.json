    "postText": " \n\nI  am looking for a roommate in the  Winter Park Area. I live off of  Goldenrod and University in a 2bd 2bth,  950 square foot apartment.\n\nI have a spare bedroom(12x14) and bathroom in need to be rented out.  It would be $675 a month plus half bills(power/internet).\n\nI work at UCF and the commute is fairly easy. Usually there within 10-15 minutes and just a straight shot from University road. Less than 5 minutes away from Full Sail the other way. \n\nDISCLAIMER:  \n\nI   have three cats. They are clean and can be kept to my room for the  most  part(Master bedroom is also 12x14 but has a larger bath and walk  in  closet for more room) Since 3 is the maximum allowed no additional  pets  can be brought into the home.",

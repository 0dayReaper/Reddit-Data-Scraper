The skills you listed follow very different course paths and require an immense amount of time and dedication to master individually. There isn\u2019t really a \u201cjack of all trades\u201d degree out there that covers all of them. \n\nIf your end goal is to become an internet celebrity, you\u2019re better off saving your money and taking notes from the people you aspire to be like. A degree may help land you a gig at a studio but isn\u2019t worth a lot when you\u2019re your own boss - everything you will learn at full sail or any other school can be learned through youtube tutorials on your own time. \n\nMaybe check out some basic After Effects or Premiere or some other Adobe software tutorials and see if it\u2019s something you can see yourself doing as a career for the foreseeable future. If you dig it and decide you really want to pursue a degree in this kind of stuff, try to pick a specialty (art, film, games, etc) and major in that. Good luck and I hope everything works out",

My advice is to not go to any school for animation. Everything you need to know can be found online and even paying a little bit for some online courses is WAY better than spending over 100 grand at Full Sail. If you spend a lot of your free time learning software and animation you will be just as good if not better than someone who went to school for it and you won't have the $1,000 a month student loans to pay back for 20+ years.",

Gen Eds almost completed, not sure if that\u2019s a thing here? Minor is completed with extra Art courses from originally being BFA track    Looking for online considering: UX, Game Dev, CS for software dev, or Game Design\nAnyone recently dealt with these programs? Odds of my past credits transferring? Can you use Sophia, Study.com, or is it not worth it from here?",

However, the particulars of Sophia and [Study.com](https://Study.com) might be best left to asking the admissions team over the phone. They're super transparent about questions like those. I personally believe the answer is going to be \\*yes\\* those credits should be able to transfer, if Full Sail's courses match well with the credits from courses you've already taken. I've personally found that they're quite flexible about that sort of stuff.",

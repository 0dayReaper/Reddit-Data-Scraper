More detailed information on some of the plugins is included in the software part of the FAQ. I'm unsure if protools certification is included, but Full Sail is listed as an Avid Learning Partner.",

To my understanding, AutoTune should be perpetual.\n\nFor iZotope RX10, I think it may be standard but I am reaching out to our Materials team to confirm this information.\n\nFor slate plugins, it should be \u2018All Access Pass\u2019 which to our understanding should be all of their plugins.\n\nMessage 2: We just wanted to follow up with you in regards to the inquiry for iZotope. At this time, our materials team was unable to confirm as it is a new software they are going to be deploying in the upcoming terms so they do not have much information on this.",

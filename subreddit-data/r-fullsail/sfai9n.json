    "postText": "Full Sail recent grad here.  \n\n\n**Hope all grads and all current students are making their wildest dreams come true!**  \n\n\nIn November I started studying NFTs and the impact they can have with the upward momentum they've been hit with. Not only are they rewarding the creators in generous amounts, but they're an opportunity for you to bring value to your art. Since I was getting so involved with the research, I decided to put some skin in the game. The first NFT I bought was called a \"Lamb Duh\". I began interacting with the community and became really close with a lot of the team and members. They came up with the idea of hosting a Beat Battle and having me co-host it. I'm really excited as this is our second beat battle. The prizes vary, and last battle we gave out 3 NFTs to the top 3 winners. Those NFTs can vary in value from $10-$70 and the winners are decided by a community vote.  \n\n\nSo, since our first event was such a success, we're going to be hosting another one this Monday at 8PM EST. In the Lamb Duh discord, ( [https://discord.gg/7Wqc4GQxyS](https://discord.gg/7Wqc4GQxyS)  ) you'll find a chat channel called #music-sharing. For this beat battle we wanted to provide 3 samples for the producers / beat makers to choose from. From there, take whichever sample you enjoy the most, and flip it, twist it, bend it, chop it, do whatever you want with it to create a piece of music that you seem fit to battle. We are not limiting our audiences to any genres. Most genres submitted have been Hip-Hop, Trap, House, EDM, Pop, Alternative, etc... You'll find the submission form in the #announcements and I believe in the music sharing channel. If you have any questions, we are more than willing to answer on here, and in the Discord chat.\n\nNow let's say you've submitted your beat. How do you win the NFT, and where do you store your brand new NFT? Come by in the general chat and any of us will be willing to assist you. Submissions are due by Monday and the beat battle is at 8PM EST in the Duhverse discord.   \n\n\nI hope to see any new members that are new to NFTs, any beat makers that want to participate with an awesome community, and anyone that's interested in chatting with a dope community! \n\n*- Jay Woods*",

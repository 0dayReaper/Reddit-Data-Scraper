Quick everyone message the head of your programs and throw in a little list for Santa clause. This school hooks it up! And not only that but the classes and online navigation is intuitive and you get what you put into it. It\u2019s worth attending this school, there\u2019s a lot of resources that help you. All you have to do is ask. No man is an island.",

I started the game design bachelor course back in June 2020 and I am gonna be starting intro to programming next month so I emailed my liaison and asked if I would be receiving the G1 or g2 headset. Hoping to get an answer back soon and hoping they can give me an answer. I\u2019ll be perfectly okay with a G1 but the g2 would be such a great value and would be amazing",

Not to mention, they didn\u2019t include the reverb so I called and they said that the headset comes in mid December. They will prolly include a G2.",

Careful on the due dates for the class, especially final week everything is due Thursday that week so they can confirm if you pass or not to ship the VR.  If you fail you immediately retake class, and vr headset gets pushed back until you pass.  Same with project and portfolio 1 the following month, final week due Thursday so it can determine pass or fail to immediately retake.  Had the class a few months ago, received the reverb g1 not g2.",

Make sure to ask questions on things you don\u2019t understand in a timely manner.  Most think it\u2019s just education but it\u2019s training you on career too, not meeting due dates and asking questions too late, most get back to you within 24-48 hours.  The discord channel also helps with connecting with instructors.  People only fail because they think they need to have their hands held along the way.  Instructors cover the basics to prepare you on the assignment, but the work needs to be done by you, the coding especially. You can borrow snippets of code found anywhere but make sure you credit the sources.  Class I\u2019m in right now is Fundamental of physical science then on to English next month, then back into the program classes, not entirely sure why they put you in some program classes then back into core classes in the middle, then back into the program.  Doesn\u2019t bother me, but I\u2019d rather had all the core classes first then jump into the program.",

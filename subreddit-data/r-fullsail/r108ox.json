    "postText": "Alright so I recently just finished English comp 2 with Karen Price as the instructor for week 3 which was worth 10% of the grade, I had finished everything. Well because Ms. Price wanted week 3 to be on the turnitin which has a shit ton of glitches she claimed I did not do my peer review and gave me a complete 0. I DID DO MY WORK FULLY AND NOW I SUFFER BY GETTING B IN MY CLASS. I went from a A to b because she decided to do this week on an app the she knows has glitches. So I messaged her and sent an email to support telling them about this situation because ik or at least have a feeling she will not read my message as she has not done before in the past I even sent her a screenshot for proof that I did my work. This has got to be the worst professor at full sail, I truly love this school, but this professor is 100% the one that might make you change your mind about if you want to continue here, they need to fire her. I'm only saying this because I had Pete Episcoto who is great, and the guy sent me a message and told me that my video was not uploaded so I uploaded the video and he gave me a 100... THAT WAS 2 MONTH'S AFTER I FINSIHED HIS CLASS. This woman is just the stress that no college student needs.",

Literally. Use them as goal points for yourself, but don't set yourself to the standard of 100-percenting all of your assignments. I've been graduated for five years, and no employer or client has ever asked for my grade in English. And I'm a journalist.\n\nIf you feel that you were mistreated, absolutely report that. But do not tie yourself to the grades within each course. Focus on the bigger picture: your career.\n\nGood luck!",

Just get through it, and do what you need to maintain scholarships if they are grade dependent. It's also important for everyone to remember.... YOU ARE GOING TO FAIL!!!! At some point, somehow, someway, for whatever reason we all fail. It's how we let it interfere with our stride that matters.",

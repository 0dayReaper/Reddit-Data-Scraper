            "comment": "Started in game art and switched to DAD. I was not a lifelong artist and basically failed out of GA. The margin for error in the artistic degrees is very thin, they basically take an assumption @ start that you already have a firm grasp on core concepts and FS is effectively not a traditional art school. DAD ended up being a good fit as I came to the realization that I *did* have a firm grasp of the core concepts of that degree.\n\nAt this point I probably could have switched schools and saved a bundle but was already balls deep into FS and so I stayed.\n\nFS is great if, objectively speaking, you're on a rail. If you're looking for anything resembling a typical college experience, you *will* suffer in some way- the best opportunities go to those who are the most serious. FS is *punishing* if you are a NEET.\n\nI wanted to take a gap year before I started at FS and only *truly* had regret for that after I started actually working for my self, to survive- it was like a realization washed over me that my outcome would have been so much greater if I had already had that paradigm shift.\n\nIn any case I had very low confidence in my professional ability when I got out of school, and on top of that tried to break into my industry back in my home market, which... Like I couldn't even get a job doing merchandising at eddie bauer- and ended up staying in FL and working a shit retail job for a few years.\n\nWhat happened next is, I fell ass backwards into *event production* a program with zero intersection w/DAD which was just kinda cruel irony- was truly a *who you know* moment in my life. Live Events turned out to be a pretty sweet gig and eventually worked myself into a position to leverage what I learned at FS, and what I had learned on the job doing events.\n\nLong story short- I use what I learned there all the time, and it's helped me stay employed. I owe too much for what I got, and my pay has never really lived up to expectation, but I'm not below the line so that's good.\n\nHot take- Full sail leverages tuition from students who fail out or otherwise have a shallow trajectory to expand the horizions of the top ~1% of performers across all enrollments. A lot of the niche degrees have very high fail-out rates which helps greatly with job placement numbers. Realize that pretty much every degree gets about ~10 enrollees every month at minimum and see how many people are in the HoF, and you can calculate some sad fractional percentages. Full sail is a serious school for adults- if you can't self categorize yourself like that, do not go there. (and don't get trapped in Florida! It took me the better part of a decade to gain enough momentum to leave the state and not go bankrupt.)",

However, if you transfer from Full Sail to another school that has been accredited by the same accreditation agency as Full Sail, then your credits *may* transfer.\n\nIt's also worth noting that within regional accredited colleges, not all credits transfer. The reasons are varied (and probably stupid), but transfer of any given credit is never guaranteed.\n\nAlso of note, none of the regional accreditation agencies will accredit for-profit schools. That's why Full Sail will only ever be able to be nationally accredited.",

            "comment": "I'm planning on writing a (probably long) post about my experience when I graduate, since I think it would be helpful for folks considering attending, especially online.\n\nI started the Digital Cinematography Bachelor's in March 2021. I'm scheduled to graduate at the end of July 2023, so I have about 7 months left.\n\nTL;DR - Online school is far from perfect. The biggest letdowns in my experience have been the other students and the lack of support from the school for networking opportunities across degrees. However, I have learned a lot from many of my classes and the experience of working on the projects. Whether it's \"worth it\" will always be subjective, but I have no regrets at this point.\n\n# Classes:\n\nNow, when you start there are a handful of general education classes everyone has to take. Psychology, English, math, science, etc. There are also a handful of classes intended to ensure students know the basics of the software packages all of us get: Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Cloud, etc. Most of these \"core\" classes are a joke. They're there because they have to be in order for the degrees to be accredited, and the course directors do try to adapt the lessons to feel relevant to the various career fields (i.e. in English, you're writing essays about news from your chosen career field).\n\nI *really* appreciated the quick pace of these classes. It helped keep me from being bored out of my mind. I wish I had been aware that applicants can \"test out\" of some of these classes. It would have saved me some time and maybe a bit of money. But the work in these classes is incredibly easy. They're designed to be passed.\n\nThat brings me to my biggest complaint about the online experience so far, and it surprisingly remains true even this late in my program: other students do not give a single flying fuck about participating in class. Hands down, the worst experience in this school is the lack of effort from classmates.\n\n# Students:\n\nThere are a handful of students who I've had classes with almost every months for a year or so. I have seen their work posted for student feedback. It is not competent work. Sometimes that means the video is way over- or under-exposed. Or it's out of focus. Or both. Or the composition is really bad. Quite often it just doesn't meet the requirements of the assignment. And despite routinely seeing work that indicates they do not know even the basics of using their camera, they keep bumping along from class to class.\n\nWhen I see that some of my classmates are able to continue sailing through the program while seeming to not understand the basic requirements of video production or the assignments, I really wonder how useful my degree is. If someone can graduate without demonstrating a consistent ability to get correct exposure, that means a degree from the Full Sail DCBS program says absolutely nothing about any sort of minimum quality a potential employer/client can expect from any other graduate.\n\n# Instructors:\n\nGenerally speaking, the instructors have been good. Most of them are approachable and seem to really enjoy what they're teaching. My art history instructor was incredibly passionate and made the class much more enjoyable than I was expecting it to be. My English instructor was incredibly chill, and encouraged me to rework my essay for class into a short article to submit to a website. My DCBS instructors have had years of experience, but embrace the changing landscape of filmmaking at all levels, appreciating that a good creative professional never stops learning.\n\nThe instructors who are good are great. In my last class I had a long, loooong phone call with my instructor. It started with me looking for advice on how to prepare for a project, and wound up just us talking about how much filmmaking has changed over the last 20 years. The really good instructors want students to succeed and they work with students who are struggling to make sure they can succeed. And in those classes you can see the difference it makes.\n\nThat being said, the instructors who are bad are really pretty awful. Luckily I have only had two instructors that I would describe as bad. The bad instructors, in my experience, are just unresponsive. Often to the detriment of students. Students with questions about assignments will just not get answers before the assignment is due, resulting in incorrect assignments and lost points. I have some sympathy for the instructors. I am sure they're underpaid for the work they're doing. But a complete lack of response is unacceptable.\n\n# Networking:\n\nAlright, big complaint number two. One of the big selling points of a creative arts school is the connections you make. That means with instructors and other students. You never know where your next job offer will come from, and networking increases your odds of having your name dropped to a potential employer/client.\n\nThe school will tell you how important networking with students and alumni is, and promise they have lots of events to facilitate networking.\n\nThat doesn't seem to be the case for online students.\n\nYour best bet is to join some clubs, but a handful of them aren't active online. I made some friends in the Creative Writing Club, and have worked with a student there to write a script for one of my projects. Other than that, it was a lot of posting in open class discussions to find student-run Discord servers, and then trying to connect with students there. I've messaged students in the DCBS classes and, usually, don't get a response (see also: classmates who seem to not care).\n\nThis is the single biggest failing on the school's part, imo. The lack of viable networking support (especially across different degrees) is a huge oversight and really devalues the potential of attending. Especially in the Creative Writing Club, there were so many students who wanted to write scripts for film/DCBS students, but they had no way of getting in touch with those students. There should absolutely be a pipeline, facilitated by the school, connecting writers with film students with music students, etc.\n\nIt is hard to feel like the lack of networking facilitation is anything other than negligence. These online programs have existed for too long (some more than 10 years) for the school not to have figured this out.\n\n# Final Thoughts:\n\nI will say that I really like the pace of classes, and it being online works really well for me. I feel like I've gotten a lot out of classes, instructors, and experience so far.\n\nWhat I really feel I'm lacking is a robust network of connections to support my career once I graduate. I can think of 2 other DCBS students who would call me if they needed a cinematographer, or refer me if they couldn't take on another client. Out of approximately 60 other DCBS students I've had classes with, I have a connection with 2. Maybe that's pretty normal, but it feels like a failure, given how much the school says they encourage networking.\n\nAt any rate, I feel good about the work I've done in the program. I've consistently been told by my instructors that I'm among the best students in my classes. I've taken the work\u2014all of the work\u2014very seriously because I know that doing so will pay off in the long term.\n\nI'm glad I decided to attend Full Sail online, I don't think I would have had the opportunity to do any of this otherwise.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m currently enrolled in and finishing my A.A.S. Graphic Design degree online and graduate in March. \n\n[[Disclaimer: I have 19 years of Graphic/Digital design experience that was fully self taught starting my freshman year of high school. While I have experience and use it regularly, I don\u2019t design as a career just as a passionate hobby. When I graduated high school I had always wanted to achieve a degree in Graphic Design but I opted to join the Military instead. These days I\u2019m a stay-at-home Dad (a dream and a nightmare all at once) and decided in my free time I\u2019d use what I have left of my GI Bill as it\u2019s been untouched since I finished my BSBA in 2016. So I am just knocking out the FS degree for fun and as a tool to have in my belt and not as a means of career development. ]]\n\nThe degree plan for the A.A.S. online is 12 months of classes (48 weeks per them) my tuition overall was $36,422.50 included in that is the Project LaunchBox stuff, which for me was Adobe and Microsoft Office subscriptions, a Sony DSLR, iPad and MacBook Pro. So don\u2019t think that you\u2019re getting free stuff, it\u2019s definitely tacked in. \n\nFor the most part, classes are plain and simple. Almost everything is prerecorded such as instructions and tutorials, they also rely heavily on Linkedin learning as well.  Each week you have a discussion board and generally a project and those are usually the highest weighted grades and are the same format for nearly every class. Lectures are live weekly via Zoom and are also recorded if you miss them. For the most part you can get away with skipping them, I\u2019ve had a class or two where they will alter assignment instructions and only bring it up in the lecture. \n\n\nThe professors/teachers are kind of blah. For the most part you\u2019ll never interact with this unless you\u2019re asking help. There\u2019s a few that I and a few others have had issues with as they graded based on personal opinion instead of the class rubric. \n\nIf you manage your time well, there\u2019s no reason you won\u2019t just breeze through this. Overall everything is super simple and easy to get a B or higher, even if you do mediocre work. \n\nNOW! Here\u2019s the important takeaway from this. If you do not have prior experience with design, DO NOT go after a degree here. Of course, you briefly learn about the principals of design, color theory and somewhat dabble in actual designing and that\u2019s nice information to have but realistically none of that matters when it comes to actually doing design work.  But that\u2019s all the degree program is, there\u2019s no learning HOW to be a graphic designer, when it comes to learning and using crucial things like photoshop and illustrator you learn less than what a free tutorial would\u2019ve taught you.\n \nIf you\u2019re looking to get a degree to boost your existing career or credentials, definitely knock this out. It\u2019s stupid simple and they move quick, associates is a year and bachelors is just over 2 (29 months).\n\nIf you\u2019re wanting to become a graphic designer as a career choice and are completely new to digital design. Absolutely do not go $30k+ into debt to chase this degree, it\u2019s NOT worth it. Look into different schools and/or spend your time looking at tutorials, learning the necessary programs and finding your design style because this isn\u2019t where you\u2019re going to do it.",

    "postText": "I'm currently a senior in high school an shave the option to attend 2 free years at my local community College through the ACCE program, I've been looking at going into offensive syber security, but have recently gone full throttle into 3D modeling and love it and seem to learn it relatively quickly.\n\nI was looking at Full Sail's Computer Animation BS and my goal would be to work for a major game or film studio such as: Blizzard, CD Prokekt Red, Pixar, Lucasfilms, Disney, ect.,\n\nMy only concern is that forost of my life, since I was about 13/14 I've planned on going into a cyber security field, and thus has felt pretty certain and stable in the area of being able to land a job, but I think I'd enjoy 3D Animation much more, but is it a safe career path? Since I've followed and always talked about this safe career path I, and others around me, have always felt safe about my future, but in this field I feel like there's a much higher likelyhood of landing a small job that's low pay or no job at all and falling into debt - and that's terrifying.\n\nI was just wanting to know, from students and/or alumni, is this field a safe one to go into with Full Sail? How much do they actually assist in getting you a job either out of college or in the future? Security in landing a job is my biggest concern, I fear that I won't be able to find work (especially good, large-scale work) following this path, but I want to follow it so bad... \n\nThank you for reading and thanks in advance!

            "comment": "Not too sure about animation or even cyber security markets. But as a Music Production grad I\u2019ve found I\u2019ve landed more gigs than a conventional job. That\u2019s why I started my own recording business. So far I\u2019ve been doing alright. I\u2019m networking and building my portfolio everyday. I\u2019m now going to pursue a degree in Entertainment Business so that I can both better run my own and perhaps have an opportunity to work at say a label or production house. \n\nMy sister has a undergrad in animation and grad in creative writing. But she hasn\u2019t used either degrees because she hasn\u2019t put in the effort. Full Sail Has a career development and an alumni network but it all comes down to how much you put in and how much effort you devote to your degree and your own development. As clich\u00e9 as it sounds. Do what you think is right. When you think ahead 5 years where do you wanna be? (Baring in mind that it is possible to change.) but full sail will also help show you there are more opportunities than just the obvious options that come to mind when thinking about a type of degree. Hope this helps bromego!",

Great to hear you're doing well and that Full Sail has that networking in place! I'll definitely be contacting them soon for more specific information on the animation industry, I saw that 51% of animation grads were hired straight out of the university, so there's some market.\n\nYou've definitely helped me see this university as a more valid option as sometimes it's hard to tell if their success stories are the majority or just the lucky few and the rest are in massive debt.\n\nThanks so much brosef!",

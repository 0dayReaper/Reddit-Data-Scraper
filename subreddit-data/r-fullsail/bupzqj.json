You arent going to draft a whole game your first job, no one will hire you to be an idea guy. You will work on teams that tackle systems within the game. Looting system, combat system, inventory system, player controller etc. You need to have some firm code experience and be able to implement the systems you design as well as design them. \nThis all means you are going to go though a lot more math, coding, scripting, and engine work than most people think when you say the names of famous designers like miyamoto and kojima.",

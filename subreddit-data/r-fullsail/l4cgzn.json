    "postText": "About to graduate high school and heavily considering a game dev BS at Full Sail, but I have some reservations based on things I've read around the internet from graduates and wanted to get some opinions from current students.\n\nWhat's it like in the classroom? I've heard things like teachers don't ever respond to online students, courses get rewritten in the middle of the year, etc. . I don't mind putting in my share of work and studying independently (and I'm sure many of these online critics are just blaming the school for their own lack of effort), but are all these problems really happening? Is Full Sail worth it?",

With that said it\u2019s not easy I have been logging 25 hours a week in programming 2 so this is a rushed degree so if you want to take it easy go else where. Other then that great school and experience even for online my teachers are always giveing me feedback",

            "comment": "Definitely ignore the internet as others have said. Full Sail is a great school for what they are offering. Industry standard training. If they change something mid-program, then their is a reason why.\nAll that said, the truest thing I have heard and later said about Full Sail is that you are going to get out of it what you put in. These are high speed programs, and a fair amount will be put on you. Be prepared to invest a lot of time outside of regular school hours. The very first programming class is a fairly deep dive into C#, and the concepts come at you fast. They expect you to take the information given and do a fair amount of outside research into them and really master it. If you are comfortable doing that, then Full Sail might be a good fit for you. \nI can't speak for Game Dev personally, but I am in Computer Science and we share the first 8 months roughly. The teachers have been extremely helpful so far, and the students that I have interacted with so far all seem to have similar goals and are willing to help each other.",

            "comment": "Definitely ignore the internet but also be aware of your own conclusions. I did both online and campus for two different degrees. \n\nClassroom (entertainment business mstr) is awesome. Your schedule will change month to month and mostly in 3 times a week. I enjoyed being on campus for the benefits it had over online. Being close to aid, resources and having a physical location to be in over my computer in my room pushed me harder I think. \n\nOnline (music production) was still incredibly beneficial, I just wish I had more access to equipment but that\u2019s neither here nor there. You have to make sure you\u2019re ready to push yourself and be accountable. You get out what you put in.\n\nCourses can be re written but that\u2019s because the schools teachers are industry professionals. Industries change. I\u2019m sure some one was trained on recording tape and then after graduation this hot new digital process was the norm. It\u2019s an ever evolving industry. \n\nI wish you luck, the school has benefitted me in more ways than education. Experience, networking, connections, opportunities to work in the alumni relations. Giving sessions and talks about related industry stuff. It\u2019s good imho.\n\nThat\u2019s just me though.",

            "comment": "I'm an online student about to graduate with a game design bachelor's and the teachers ,for me at least, respond to questions and such, you just have to pay attention to the contact information area because some say they respond quicker to different forms of communication (fso,email,discord) I have two kids (3years and almost 2 years) and even with having a kid during college this school has been very accommodating and helpful. I've been able to stay on the honor roll and it's because of working hard and good communication. I believe Full Sail is worth it, but it is important to research and never stop learning new things just like when we are in the industry. Grab a head start with Brackeys and unreal engine tutorials to get a good edge on things and have fun!",

You'll save so much money. Full Sail also does not let you transfer credits so you're stuck there. Accordingly they are a for profit university and their programs are rushed. They want to get you through their program so you can start paying them that's their endgame.",

    "postText": "I finally made it through the admissions process and I start in January. I\u2019m working on the Masters in Instructional Design and Technology program. I teach high school, so this will help me out in the long run. The plan is to eventually be the instructional technology trainer on campus. I have twin toddlers, a boy and a girl. I have a feeling these classes are going to kick my butt, but from what I read, it\u2019s worth it. Has anyone else out there completed this program? ",

I have a background in graphic design so the assignments that call for photoshop and illustrator weren\u2019t too crazy but I can see if one is not familiar with that software how some assignments could be a challenge. Conversely, I find the learning theory based courses to be a bit more of a challenge for me. You might breeze through those, who knows. So far I\u2019ve enjoyed the professors and all have been helpful and very positive. Good luck",

I chose Full Sail over other traditional schools because I really like their hands-on approach. I\u2019m an outside of the box kind of person and I didn\u2019t want to drag myself through a traditional school\u2019s program. I was bored through most of my Bachelors degree classes. I\u2019m excited to get to use the knowledge I learn with my current and future students. I know the road will be a little rough, but I know it will make life much better. ",

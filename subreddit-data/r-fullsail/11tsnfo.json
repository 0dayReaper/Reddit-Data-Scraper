    "postText": "Campus is pretty cool!\n\nI got to meet some other students I met through clubs and student-run discord servers. Through them I met a handful of awesome students on campus and a few campus instructors.\n\nI was only able to meet with one of my past instructors, but it was an amazing experience to just get to chat with him for a few hours.\n\nI got to see the Virtual Studio (LED wall) and talk to Kyle, the manager of that stage. Incredible experience.\n\nAll-in-all, I'm really glad I had the chance and made the time to visit campus.",

That's including reading assignments, lectures, homework, all of it.\n\nOther months it's a lot of work. Basically any month you're actually shooting a film or doing preproduction (location scouting, getting paperwork signed, storyboarding, etc.) it's closer to a full-time workload.\n\nMaintaining a full time job might make some classes a bit challenging, but mostly because you'll need to schedule around your job to get filming and such done. As far as the workload for homework and stuff it's really not bad.",

Contact any instructors you'd like to meet up with a week or so before your trip to see if they'll be available.\n\nI found a reasonably priced Airbnb to stay in with my partner, was under $200 after taxes for 3 nights and was less than 10 minutes driving from campus.\n\nIf you fly in you will need to rent a car or pay for a lot of Lyft/Ubers. The entire area is car-centric.\n\nI would recommend reaching out to your instructors by phone/text once you're in the area to confirm when/where to meet.\n\nOnce you get to campus you'll have to go to the security office and get a student ID badge. This is supposed to cost $10 but they didn't charge me for mine. Luck of the draw, I think?\n\nDefinitely good to hop on a tour. You can do this by going to the main entrance (near security) and telling them you're a current student and want to hop on the next tour. They happen every hour starting at 10am on weekdays.\n\nI would also recommend (I wasn't able to do this, just bad timing) seeing if you can meet with your program director. You can find their contact info on your program page, or ask one of your instructors. They're just a good person to have know your name.\n\nMake some business cards and bring them. *Do not be shy about handing them out!* About half of the students I met handed me business cards. I wish I had some ready for this trip. A couple of campus instructors asked me if I had one to give them.\n\nThe real burden is going to be getting to Orlando/Winter Park from wherever you are. Whether you fly or drive (I drove from Texas, but I have family in a different part of Florida), it's going to take either time or money.",

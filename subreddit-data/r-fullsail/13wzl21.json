I graduated in Web Design in 2010. It was not worth it. Most of the labs and training are simply power points and videos you can easily find online. None of my employers cared that I went to Full Sail. If you are motivated you can teach yourself anything. Find mentors on LinkedIn. Full Sail doesn't have anything you can't learn for free. If you need a degree I would consider a standard university and focus on building a body of work",

Especially the graphic stuff which is all the basic things only. \n\nI was hoping if I narrowed down my major to something more focused like digital marketing it would be better. Or just changed my entire major because since I\u2019m military and using those benefits changing my school would be much more of a hassle rather than changing my major",

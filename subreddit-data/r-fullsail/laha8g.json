I know there's COVID and stuff going on, but is there any way I can connect with other students and meet up? I want to make friends asap.

And good luck finding other students on here, I've tried multiple times to contact alumni or make friends and this subreddit is pretty much empty. Good luck though dude, I hope you meet tons of friends soon!",

Right now, I'm doing the first week's work. Can't wait until I get later into the program! My only concern right now is that students are having a hard time meeting up with each other, it seems. The campus isn't open fully.\n\nI chose Full Sail because I heard it is one of the best schools in the U.S. for game development. Also, it has tons of clubs to get involved in, and with its intense schedule, it really forces you to commit to what you're learning.",

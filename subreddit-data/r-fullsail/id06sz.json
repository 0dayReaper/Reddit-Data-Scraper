I am close to paying off my car and am going to move in a few months but I would really love trying to find a way to get to my dream school. If anyone has any wisdom to bestow on me I would be so grateful.",

If you really apply yourself and truly want to get the most out of the classes it\u2019s totally worth it. They really push networking and give you all the help they can to get your career started. A lot of people don\u2019t take the help though, and those are typically the people that don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. \n\nResearch your anticipated degree and really look into jobs in that field. Make sure to look at how many require a degree to really see if it\u2019s a good choice for you. I\u2019m going for Graphic Design and although there are designers without a degree for corporate jobs it\u2019s usually a requirement.",

You have to put your effort tho, you get what you put, you need to strive for 110% to really squeeze out all the juice, you have to look around, become involved, and most importantly be yourself, only then will it truly matter. FullSail has the project launch box, you should check it out. Join clubs and engage with your peers. What is so amazing about it is that your degree program is inter correlated with other programs, so that means you\u2019ll get to work on a project together with someone with a completely different degree, it\u2019s this core element that makes FullSail so engaging.",

As great and modern as their program looked I couldn\u2019t justify the debt right now and am going with another school for the time being. \nWhen I applied I was told if I apply for fasfa and was rewarded the full amount I would most likely be eligible for the Momentum Schlorship which is 25k to a bachelors. What I didn\u2019t realize is your have to fully exhaust all awarded fasfa in order to quality for the 25k. Example I got awarded full pell grant and 9k in Stafford Loans. In order for me to qualify for the scholarship I would have to max out the Stafford loans. And even after that with the scholarship I\u2019d have to pull out an additional $8k+ in loans from else where. Obviously I don\u2019t know your finances so maybe it\u2019s not an issue for you but just incase that would be my only warning is prepare for 17k+ in debt (that was for a bachelors in graphic design btw) \nBest of luck!!",

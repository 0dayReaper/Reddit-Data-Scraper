    "postText": "Hello everyone. My name is Thomas Claiborne and I am a new student taking classes online studying Game Development. I was wondering when would I receive my launch box and what current gen MSI GE laptop am I receiving. I was speaking to someone in a discord who is a month ahead of me and is also taking game development online. He said that he got his launchbox on his 3rd week in creative presentation. He also mentioned that he got a MSI GE76 Raider instead of a 75, that also comes with a rtx 3080 gpu. I just wanted clarification for the ones who received their launch boxes recently and to know when to expect it. Thank you! Also looking for new friends!",

I heard Game Development is worth it at Full Sail so I wish you good luck.\nThey really seem to give you the best computer they can so it can handle any projects you may create. \nHowever if you run into any issues with your computer or any other technology you recieve, it's up to you to fix it. Full Sail will tell you once it ships, it's your problem and property. You can contact them or your instructors if you have issues with your programs though.",

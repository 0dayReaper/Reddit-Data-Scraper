    "postText": "Hey Everyone! I was looking for some more information about Full Sail Game Art program, preferably someone who is currently in or have graduated. I am currently in the process of attending the game art program but before I shell out the money to study there, I wanted to know if the game art program is primarily focused on 3-D art? Will I still be doing some digital painting ? My goal in the game industry is to become a concept artist so will this program help me archive that goal?",

            "comment": "The bulk of what you'll learn is 3D Art. With only a few classes that will let you have some fun with digital drawing or painting. If you want to experiment more with digital drawing and more broad paths just check out some other programs and options just in case. I had to drop out due to some personal issues and liked the program for a lot of aspects of it, but if I'd do it all over again, personally I would seek more options.",

Know that there is a ton of technical stuff production modellers/animators/etc need that will be completely useless to a concept artist. \n\nAll of this in mind, there are typically 4-5 production artists for every concept artist, concept is a very hard job to get, the skills taught in this course can get you hired, just not as a concept artist as it focuses mainly on technical skills rather than proficient design.",

Maya is probably the last one id suggest for concept art, having thousands of hours in it myself XD\n\nI went through uni so im a bit of a hypocrite but i dont recomend any artist go to college, just work on ur craft, join some concept art discords, make sone friends and make a ton of art, its the best, cheapest, most direct route to ur dream job.",

There are only 2-3 classes focused on transitional art and sketching and they\u2019re very remedial. These degrees are heavily focused on modeling and animation in Maya (Animation has less classes focused on game res models, with classes on rigging and animating). They\u2019re worth while skills for any artist in the industry, but other then completing a bachelors degree I\u2019m not sure the experience and skill set is what you\u2019re looking for.",

Many of my classes reiterated that this is no formal Photoshop class in the Game Art degree program, but we are provided access to LinkedIn learning, to learn it on our own time. If I am remembering my timeline correctly, we started working with Maya by month 3, there are core classes and a couple traditional art classes sprinkled in.\n\nI'm a little over a year in, with a couple breaks for a family emergency, and a tech emergency that I couldn't recover from for a four week class. We just started using Zbrush, last month.",

If that makes any sense.\n\n Traditional arts were always a struggle, and have increasingly come with physical pain attached which pushed me even further away. \n\n3d modeling has been like a puzzle for me though, it's had it's frustrations especially when tools don't work like they're supposed to. But I've come to enjoy the process. \n\nGood luck on your adventure, and don't dread the twists that come your way!",

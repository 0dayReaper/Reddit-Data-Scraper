    "postText": "I start full sail on Monday for the Creative Writing program. Anyone that is receiving BAH for attending the school how does it work? I\u2019m newly transitioned from the military and first time using this benefit. I used tuition assistance while I was active and do they take into account dependents for higher bah? Lastly, I\u2019m using Chapter 31 so if anyone can give me some insight it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit: will be attending via online",

They don\u2019t give extra for dependents. For that, you\u2019ll want to be sure you get a VA disability claim in and then you get compensation for dependents.",

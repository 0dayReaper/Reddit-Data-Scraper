    "postText": "   For the first time I made the decision of reporting a professor for unprofessional behavior. This man talks to us as his students as if we are idiots. He complains about us asking the same question even though I and several others have explained that he talks fast and if he were to turn on the transcript during zoom meetings we would not have this problem, but he refuses to do so. \n\n   If it had just been me feeling this way I would not have reported him. But it isn't. He says he's a tough grader because that's how the entertainment industry is. Well guess what, now I'm a tough grader because that's what the student industry is now. I will not accept any disrespect or allow my peers to be disrespected anymore. A student should not have apologize for asking the same question. \n\n   If several students are asking the same questions again, then it's not us, it's you. I don't feel bad about reporting him. He's made my peer cry and another almost relapsed because of his words. I know he will not be fired. But I hope he will learn from this experience.",

            "comment": "I actually quit with 2 classes left in my certificate (originally degree, but I dropped down due to the crappy experience) because of months and months of seeing professors treat their students like crap, borderline abuse. I reported each and every one in great detail. There's one person on the student advocate team who actually cares, but none of their bosses do so there's nothing they can really do. I met people online through my orientation who have had a wonderful experience start to finish, I think it really varies on the program. But mine was so horrible that I didn't even WANT a certificate/degree from them anymore, I would be embarrassed to accept it.\n\nAside from the 'professors' being inexperienced jackasses (the director of the Game Design program's shining jewel on his resume is a Disney Princess match-3 shovelware DS game), the classes themselves were a complete joke. It was not the 'tough' experience I was expecting, it was insultingly easy fluff and youtube tutorials. Awful.\n\nThe last thing I sent them was like a 5 page letter detailing the worst stuff, and how it was the exact opposite of the experience I was sold on-- and therefore was demanding they send me notice that I owed them nothing otherwise I absolutely would not be withdrawing. I never mentioned the 'lawyer' word but I think they knew- because they actually did wipe my debt and send me a '$0 owed' letter.\n\nedit: I know a couple of the kids who were in classes with me are still struggling through it, I've honestly had to mute them because I just can't help with that crap anymore. It was such a negative experience, it's shocking.",

    "postText": "Are there any additional resources available to students who are not in the best positions financially. I am currently on a few scholarships but cannot cover enough for the new academic year. I cannot attain a cosigner for another parent plus loan and private loans have interest rates that no one in my family wants to sign onto. I am currently a student and work two jobs to cover my rent and food. Could someone present options for students in my situation , and myself as well?",

Because that's where you'll need to start.\n\nIf FAFSA is an exhausted option due no one willing to co-sign additional funding, your remaining alternative is to pretty much start applying for every scholarship you're eligible for. Are you on-campus or online? This is another major factor, as there may or may not be local state assistance. \n\nDefinitely contact student financial aid if you haven't already, though.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am currently enrolled into the Game Design Bachelors program just starting my third \u201csemester.\u201d My question is, if you\u2019re following what\u2019s going on in the game design professional development discord could you explain it to me like I\u2019m 5? The chat seems to have been disabled and the overall thing of it is something to do with the game design track losing accreditation and them no longer offering a \u201cgame design degree\u201d now it\u2019s a \u201cinteractive tech, focus in game design\u201d bachelors and my issue is not only that of course, but there was no transparency, as I\u2019m not hearing about this from the school but from other students in the discord. I understand a lot of the students emotions are running hot, understandably so as they are paying a lot of money for this and we\u2019re no longer sure what\u2019s going on but I want to try and have someone explain to me cause I guess I don\u2019t fully understand and it\u2019s very important. I will also try to call the school this week and I\u2019ll keep you guys updated, if you\u2019d like.",

I just have an issue with the lack of information, transparency, follow-up, etc. and we\u2019re all left to discover things on our own. They sent out an email last year informing us all about the ACCSC situation but had zero follow-up afterwards. It\u2019s perplexing.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t support the school. Would just like some transparency.",

    "postText": "A little background information is needed, originally I was going to college to get my degree in painting and drawing At the University of North Florida. I had a bit of a health scare and I was in a coma in 2019 due to that my GPA was very low. The only other college I could get into after I fully recovered was fullsail originally I wanted to go to grad school to study animation after I got my bachelors in painting and drawing. So I thought that fullsail Would be fine to go to and just get my computer animation degree there. I\u2019m an older student 24 and due to my health scare it did set me back. I\u2019ve done pretty well in my other classes but just recently I\u2019ve started a class that I\u2019ve struggled with and failed already. No matter what I seem to do I cannot get the concept I\u2019ve gone to help sessions and ask for help and I was pretty discouraged after I was told that I shouldn\u2019t have a job and be at school at the same time, as well as insulted because that professor doesn\u2019t know my background history and how much I\u2019ve struggled with my health issues in the past and this job is the only way I can pay for school in the first place. I feel my mental health declining and I can\u2019t even really get my help from my advisor, they just tell me I should have had prior knowledge in the programs before applying to fullsail. Should I just stick it out and just try my hardest and finishing my degree that I am working on for 5+ years, and I don\u2019t even know when I\u2019m going to finish because I feel like I\u2019m gonna fail the same class again. Or should I just leave with my associates and struggle for the rest of my life because I don\u2019t have a bachelors degree and I\u2019m not good at anything else. Sorry this is so long I don\u2019t have any family or friends to help me and I truly feel so helpless",

The lab hours were always a huge help to me because it gave me an opportunity to ask questions to people that weren't my professor. It also sounds crazy bc you pay so much money to go there you should be taught what you need, but finding alternative online resources and tutorials can often bring a different perspective to the skill. \n\nI don't know if this is still a thing but when I was at fullsail we had a subscription to lynda.com (which is basically like a skillshare or masterclass website) that had tutorials with exercise files that you could follow along with that could help find what step in the process is causing you issues. \n\nKeep your head up and believe in yourself. Some of the professors are truly amazing with astounding credentials. Some have those credentials but have no business teaching.",

I just feel like I\u2019m so far behind from everyone else because I just learned Maya coming into fullsail. I\u2019m not on campus I I\u2019m the online track even though I live close to the area. My understanding was the online track was better for ppl who still wanted to work but I guess that\u2019s not the case? YouTube tutorials really helped me during 3D modeling and I felt like I was getting good at it but portfolio 2 is kicking my butt :/",

THere were absolutely people ahead of me but you can't compare yourself to others. Maya is a beast of a program and honestly the tutorials online were the only reason I made it through the first couple classes. You may be having some sleepless nights ahead of you, but if its something you want to do, don't get discouraged. \n\nIf you decide full sail isn't for you, there no shame it following a different path either. It's a lot of money to spend on an education, if your heart isn't fully into it then you need to evaluate if it's worth it. With this I would recommend talking to a mental health professional. No one else can determine these things but you. I wish you luck!",

Look at failing a class as an opportunity to learn that material twice as well. Rigging will probably be the hardest.",

Idk about now but when I was at full sail you could re take the class as many times as needed to pass as long as it was for grades and not attendance \n\nAlso, as someone who struggles with chronic illness, keep pushing. Stopping will only further your struggles with mental health. Keep pushing for answers, keep pushing for help. Keep telling your story. \n\nI struggled in one class in particular. I had an instructor give me a grade that I didn\u2019t deserve. My project met ALL the criteria for the grade I felt I deserved based on the instruction given. I was given a lesser grade. (Maybe due to personal issues between the instructor and myself having incompatible personalities or something \ud83e\udd14 I\u2019m still not exactly sure tho\u2026)I escalated the situation because my GPA and GPS was important to me and I put in extra work on the preproduction to get a 100%. I felt the effort was worth the grade I was owed. I cannot remember who I cc\u2019d in the email I sent but it got things moving and shaking and my grade was changed to reflect the work I put in because they could find NO REASON for him to have docked my grade. Point is - be the squeaky wheel! You owe it to yourself to have no regrets!! You are paying for this!!!!!",

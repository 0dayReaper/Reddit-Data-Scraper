    "postText": "I graduated back in 2009 with an Associates In Audio Production/Engineering. I called to ask what might transfer if I wanted to continue the program and got routed to admissions. Admissions said that they can't say what might transfer from my existing degree into the new Audio Production bachelor's program they have until I apply. But I was trying to see, does anyone know, even just a rough guess? Thanks!",

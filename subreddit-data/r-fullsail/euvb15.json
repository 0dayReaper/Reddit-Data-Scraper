I find that unlikely since a) I\u2019ve never heard of them and b) up until finding this sub, I was pretty sure they were nothing more than a scam.  \n\nSeriously, does anyone know how to get the hell off their spam list?? Their marketers are blowing up my voicemail.",

It wasn't me calling them of course, but the main number to the school shows up on their caller ID even when marketing/admissions reps call them, and then I got to take the brunt of it. \n\nAnyway, what we were told is that these people are being called because they filled out something somewhere at some point requesting information about colleges. So, if you ever did anything like that, it's possible your information was sold to Full Sail. \n\nIf someone actually calmed down enough to give me their information so I could find them in the system, I was able to switch their status to \"Do Not Contact.\" This was also over 10 years ago though. But, if you call and are nice to the poor person who answers, they should be able to change your status so that you don't get calls anymore.",

I understand a representative is doing their job but at the same time it should be illegal to do the types of hangup calls these places do and force you to have to try and find time to call back during business hours to make the harassment stop.",

For what it's worth, it can't hurt to try. Keep in mind some degrees stagger the launch box items, so you don't nesscarily get everything at once.",

No financial aid is taken, you can change your Major, etc. You get your iPad at or around the first month some time. Towards the end of it from my understanding, but it might be sooner. You get the rest of it at month 3. Some people say that you get more spread throughout the year; maybe so? It's not what I was told recently though.",

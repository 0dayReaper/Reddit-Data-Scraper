    "postText": "Recently I\u2019ve been talking back and forth with the admissions office. Someday I\u2019d love and have a passion for making environments characters can walk in, I\u2019ve done sone work on Unity, and when I was little Roblox Studio. Obviously that\u2019s nothing compared to Unity but it got my love for level designing started. I keep being directed to 3D Game Art but I\u2019m finding the whole drawing character aspects to be a bit.. mundane. I just like building environments. Is this the only path they offer for something like this?",

The curriculum is built to have you experience each role in a 3D pipeline at least once.",

But level design encompasses things like, what's the goal of the level, what objects are present in the level, how hard is it, how does the difficulty scale based on player level, etc, etc.\n\nEnvironment is whatever the level *looks like* when playing. It's the shapes of the buildings. The color of the sky. If it's a platformer like Super Mario Bros (I'm old) it's the bushes and the bricks and the clouds.",

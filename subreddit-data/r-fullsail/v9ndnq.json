            "comment": "If I may ask, how did your tour go? \n\nI can only speak for the online program. The online MP program is 29 months versus the 20 months on-campus program. This is because online students typically take 1 class per month vs the two or three classes campus students take. My program is going pretty well. It starts off with basic classes like Creative Presentations, Writing, etc. Music Production is a program with a lot of music theory. Classes like Fundamentals of Music, Musical Structure &amp; Analysis, and Musicianship really dive deep into music theory/composition and music scales. In classes like Project &amp; Portfolio, you'll begin building your music portfolio, which is fun and important. I am learning a lot and it has been very enjoyable, but very challenging. This is good because it lets me know I am learning. However, I am changing my major to Audio Production because I would like to learn more about mixing, mastering, and sound design than just music theory and composition. Nothing wrong with theory and composition, that's just not in my overall career goals as a musician.\n\nLike I have heard many times before, you get out of Full Sail what you put into it. I do believe that it is worth it if you commit yourself to the work and do your best. Keep writing and recording music. Do more than what is required. I am sure you've heard this before, but networking and making connections are key! One of Full Sail's sayings is \"If you're serious about your dream, we'll take your dream seriously.\" This is true! I believe you'll do well.",

            "comment": "This is pretty spot-on. What most people don't realize about Full Sail is that there are no academic or artistic standards for admission. So when people point to the 70-something-percent drop-out rate, what they don't take into account is that, frankly, most of those people *had no business being there in the first place*. They either don't have the drive, or the discipline, or, let's face it, the *talent* to succeed in that environment. They didn't take their studies seriously and thought that they could just skirt through school on auto-pilot and jump right into the industry afterwards. That's not how it works, and, contrary to this video, I honestly don't believe that Full Sail promises any of that.\n\nWhat Full Sail has done is put top-of-the-line gear in my hands that I could not afford otherwise and taught me how to use it. I didn't know a thing about cameras when I started at Full Sail, and now I own and know how to operate a Netflix-approved cinema camera. I'd never touched Adobe Premiere Pro in my life a year ago, and now I'm using it every day like it's nothing. These are the skills that you are going to learn at Full Sail, and it's up to each individual student to make their own opportunities with those skills and that gear.\n\nBut it's an intensive program. You're earning a Bachelor's Degree in either 20 (on campus) or 29 (online) months. It's a lot of work, and it takes full dedication and concentration to succeed in these classes. It isn't difficult, per se, but it's a *lot*. If you aren't prepared for that, you're gonna to burn out and drop out just like 70% of people who start these programs. Do your research. Know what you're getting into. Full Sail is not a \"golden ticket\" into the entertainment industry, it's a technical college. And a damn good one, at that. Just treat it accordingly.",

I guess I just mean that Full Sail heavily pours lots of money into marketing to as many people as possible to try and get as many students as possible. \n\nWhen I initially toured the campus, I was with a group of other kids who clearly had no business being there, but the rep was more than happy to tell them \u201cthis is where dreams happen\u201d with a smile. \n\nBut again, as I said in the video, it\u2019s not a scam. They do offer and provide what they claim to, but they have no problem at looking the other way when someone clearly has no idea what they\u2019re getting into.",

I did have to stay up late nights because something in the lab wasn\u2019t working correctly and I did have to spend time over the weekend on homework. But I learned so much things about using virtual machines and how to build a virtual environment that I never once knew about. If you take what they give you and apply it then you\u2019re getting everything full sail is offering.",

It all depends on how many hours you put in. Just like with everything in life, you have to put in the hours in order to make your dream come true.",

When people hear I go to full sail they act like \u201coh that\u2019s why your grade are good because it\u2019s so easy.\u201dWell I work 30+ hours a week on school and I work Monday-Sunday and I never get a real break but I have learned so much and a lot of that time is me doing my own work to advance in what I am learning in class. I was looking to transfer so I could have a break but the actual experience lacks at other schools",

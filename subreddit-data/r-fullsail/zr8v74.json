That should get you the terminology, and some technical skills to beat out your competition, and help networking (with *working* professionals). All for a measly $250 investment compared to college debt.",

I\u2019m in the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Masters of Science, and all of my instructors are active entrepreneurs who have dedicated time to me and my projects, as well as offered 10x the resources I hoped to find solo.\n\nSelf teaching really only works if you know what you\u2019re doing",

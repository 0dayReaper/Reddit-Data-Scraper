            "comment": "I am on my last week of my first month.  The online stuff is easy to use.  Very user friendly.  The first class is Creative Presentation and it\u2019s not too hard.  It\u2019s not a very fun class for me personally and I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s wrapping up.  It could be your thing.  There is like 1 semi large project each week and then you are graded on participating in the weekly discussion board.  But, the teacher is good and helpful.  I am still working more than full time along side and I have been able to maintain a mid 90s A throughout the class.  I certainly wouldn\u2019t overthink any of the projects. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be causing yourself extra work without much reward.",

And quite frankly, I\u2019d have no interest in living in Florida.  But, that\u2019s my personal preference.  However, I see no real benefits to taking online courses if you can do it in person.  Hands on learning is great and the Full Sail campus seems to be pretty equipped with all sorts of resources.  I also wouldn\u2019t take the negative reviews the other commenter wrote about the online program too seriously.  Most of the negative reports seem to come from people who didn\u2019t take their time seriously while not learning how to do their stuff properly and thinking that a job was just going to fall into their laps.  There is a huge movement in education that all you need is to just get that diploma and it doesn\u2019t matter if you just squeak by.  That is wrong.  If you take the proper time to develop the skills as intended, you should have no issue finding a well paying job in animation when you graduate from the online program.",

            "comment": "Finishing my final week in Creative Presentation.\n\nQuality: Top par. I transferred from a private University and believe I\u2019ve received more real-world value from this one class than I did an entire year at my private school.\n\nCurriculum: The content so far has been updated, relevant, and practical. Yes I enjoyed Creative Presentation but objectively the course is suited for the \u201cnow\u201d work force and professional preparation. \n\nThe textbooks were the latest in the field of study and that\u2019s when I knew I was learning what I needed to be learning. And yes, FullSail updates its curriculum more than other popular and established Universities.\n\nHowever many of the students gave shit effort. Honestly, it doesn\u2019t surprise me there are negative reviews because you don\u2019t get value from FullSail by GOING there you get value by applying yourself and doing more than you are asked to. If you are going to take negative reviews about the curriculum make sure it is from a CREDIBLE person who produces impressive content.\n\nWith many graduates on YouTube I noticed their content itself is mediocre and that is not so much a reflection of the education but the student. I mean they have 100% acceptance rate despite being a great school \u2014 and with that a lot of mediocre people who aren\u2019t very disciplined. \n\nAnyway \u2014 listen to credible people. If you buy their a opinion you buy their lifestyle and execution.",

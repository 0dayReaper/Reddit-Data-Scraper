I laughed it off man they weren\u2019t kidding. Model creation and shading and lighting put an handful of students on the fast track of dropping out.  Good times!",

I think like 1/3 of my classmates were taking it for the second, or even third time. The first character sculpting class was similar, but class sizes shrank dramatically at that point.",

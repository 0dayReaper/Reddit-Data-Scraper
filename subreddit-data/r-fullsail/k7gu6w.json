    "postText": "I\u2019ve been thinking about applying to the Disney college program next year and was wondering if someone can have a job and do online classes without it being overbearing. I know that by doing online you can have more flexibility in when you do your work. So I\u2019m kinda hopeful. I\u2019m going to contact my SL later but I just wanted to know your guys thoughts about it. Also I may not get in so it may not even be a problem.",

It\u2019s perfectly manageable for my degree, but I think it also comes down to your own time management. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s different in other degrees, but most of my work load is due on Thursdays and Sundays, so I try to do the work throughout the week so it\u2019s ready submit those days.",

You will have to be able to prioritize very well, be very well managed and organized, and commit fully to what you want to accomplish. Full Sail is not the school to fuck around with. They will take your money, and let you fail if you aren't holding up your end of the agreement. That said, there are many advantages to Full Sail Online. The lectures for every class I have had are recorded, so you can watch them later if you aren't free for the live session. The assignments are weekly, due on Sunday, so you don't have random things due at odd times during the week. The teachers and my classmates so far have been extremely helpful and supportive.\n\nAll in all, the answer is dependent upon you and the program you want to pursue. They can all be done while working, but they also all differ in the amount of work required each month. In the end, if you want it enough then you can make it happen.",

It helps knowing a thing or 2 about your degree path and having some experience in it already but it is totally manageable if you are good with time management.",

But, if you're not quite as familiar or savvy with development then most of the assignments are worth setting aside a few hours each day just to noddle away on them until the due date. The main thing is that most courses give you a lot of flexibility where you can start a test and save your progress then come back hours or even days later to finish it. Lectures are optional for the most part and you can always catch up on the recorded sessions if you need further guidance with things. Discord is essentially the lifeline when you need help.\n\nPersonally, my full-time job was super demanding where I'd travel a lot and work 10-15 hours per day. I still managed to get my assignments done on time or within a reasonable amount of time. I really can't stress enough how beneficial it is to be familiar and experienced with the materials of your degree ahead of time. YouTube tutorials and Udemy can do wonders to save you from sleepless nights.",

It is doable but it does take discipline, after I get off work every day I take a break for about an hour before logging in and looking over what I have to do for class that week.\n\nThis month my lectures happen to be on Tuesday's while I am working so I can catch a live lecture like I would like to. If I look over everything and decide that I can slack off a little bit, I will use Monday to do things unrelated to school... Perhaps the reading is long this week and if it is I could get started early or I could take a break from all of it.\n\nI never let work get in the way of my school work. In fact, after I clock out work is totally off my mind until the next morning when I wake up.",

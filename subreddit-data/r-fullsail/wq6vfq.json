Is that just if I\u2019m accepted or do I have to do the orientation no matter what? I just want to make sure I\u2019m not on the hook to do something if I decide not to do my certificate program with them.\n\nAlso, can I pay by the credit? If that\u2019s how I want to do it, can I arrange that with someone?",

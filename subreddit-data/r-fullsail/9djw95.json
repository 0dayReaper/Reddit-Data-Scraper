I have a wedding to attend on December 8th and I'm trying to plan ahead.",

I believe the only other time it would happen would be due to weather emergencies or something similar causing the school to be closed for an extended period of time. ",

When you get to your December just tell them that you have a wedding to go to and share them a photo of the Save The Date, they'll work out a plan with you so that you don't miss what they teach, since they also have it available online, either as a presentation or have it prerecorded for the Online students.",

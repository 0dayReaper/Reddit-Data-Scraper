I already try using blender like these people over at Full Sail ask me to use. I try to use it and it is not working out it is extremely hard to learn because I have worked in Maya for 15 years.",

They also use RenderMan which comes with a free personal license.\n\nI am a Computer Animation graduate and i regularly use the Educational version of Maya for personal needs. \n\nIf you're needing a full version of Maya for some reason, at some point you're going to just have to pay for it like everyone else. \n\nAlternatively, you can try auditing a class. This will enroll you as a student and MAY allow you to access certain student perks such as educational licenses. No promises, there.",

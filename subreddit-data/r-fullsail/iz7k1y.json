So far Full Sail has been the cheapest option (online). Is there cheaper schools for what I want to do. I don\u2019t live in Florida so UCF is out of the question because it\u2019s too much money.",

Try seeking out people in those two career fields and review their portfolios to see which area interests you more. \n\nAlso, since it seems that you're pretty dead-set on online classes.. And if animation interests you, I've seen a lot of great work come from here [https://www.animschool.com/](https://www.animschool.com/)",

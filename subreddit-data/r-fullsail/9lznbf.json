    "postText": "Hi guys, Im currently enrolling in Software development and im super happy about. Im from philly but I got my high school diploma in Puerto Rico, and they are asking for a translation. I don't know if its because the diploma is in Spanish or to check my credentials. They gave me a list of companies to call and see but I really don't understand what steps to take. Isn't a translation more if come from lets say Russia, Afghanistan. Doesn't it matter that Puerto rico is part of the United states? Or do they treat Puerto rico as another country?",

There is most likely a requirement for all documents to be in one standard language (english, as it's the majority), or have a question about one of your courses translation. It's more than likely something small like that.\n\nIf the process confuses you, I would try to reach out to your enrollment guide, or even the international department. They deal with transcripts in all kinds of different languages, and probably know the easiest way to get it done. ",

I find the weird because Puerto rico is part of the United states, and they follow the same standards. But yeah I will call Monday, I believe they are closed right now.",

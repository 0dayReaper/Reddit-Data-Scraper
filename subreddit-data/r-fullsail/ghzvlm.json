    "postText": "After searching online and on FS\u2019s website I\u2019ve decided to come to reddit for the answers since it knows everything. Here\u2019s my story, as short as possible.\n\nI\u2019m 32 year old father of 2 young kids. I have a bachelors degree in communication technology from a state college, graduated in 2009. I have done nothing with my degree. I\u2019ve worked as a chef since before I even graduated college. For years I\u2019ve thought about getting out of the kitchen and back to school for a better degree or maybe a masters. Since I\u2019ve been at home and laid off due to covid, I know that I want out of the restaurant industry, mainly because I miss my family. So I have been looking for online degrees in animation, which was my favorite course in college (only one animation course available at the time). Full Sail seems to be the right fit for me. Mainly because the \u201csemester\u201d starts every month (I believe) and it\u2019s accelerated, etc. \n\nSo a few questions:\n\nWould I be required to take all the general eduction courses like English and math, even though I have more than enough from my bachelors degree? Assuming transcripts are good and credits excepted, but I\u2019m concerned about the time that has past and the fact that I completed the other degree.\n\nDo you think It\u2019s possible to work full time (over time) and complete this program? I\u2019m not afraid of working and doing school but as a chef I work 15 hour days, sometime 6 or 7 days a week. On top of being a father. I\u2019m all about early morning and late night school but is it actually possible? I understand FS is pretty intense as it\u2019s accelerated.\n\nAlso I see a lot about the Launch Box. Is that included in tuition or bought separately? If so how crazy expensive is that?\n\nI\u2019ve basically decided I\u2019m going to go back to school for animation, any insight on Full Sail would help me get there sooner. Thanks everyone.",

            "comment": "I do not know about that particular degree program but I can add some insight on the Launchbox.  It contains all the software and hardware you'll need in every class of your chosen program.  Courses and departments try to maintain close ties with the shipping departments to make sure what students will need will be in the launchbox.  So it's not really optional.  AFAIK it is folded into your cost.  \n\n\nAs for the GE courses I would expect you can transfer credits, but don't quote me.  I'd ask an admissions person.    \n\n\nYou will sign a contract that states you will reserve 20 hours per week for coursework.  Some courses won't demand that time from you, but others will be monsters that don't even fit in that box.  So make sure the whole family is on board, because the programs go balls to the wall.",

I do have a meeting set up with the school later this week and they were the first to follow after filling out my fasfa but I kind of wanted to get a jump on things as I am just beginning to decide which school I want to go to.",

            "comment": "Hey there. \n\nSo I think you\u2019re making the right choice, congrats on taking the first steps!\n\nTo answer your question, it never hurts to have skill in cooking before you step in the kitchen. \n\nHowever, if you\u2019ve never cooked a day in your life, that\u2019s okay! They\u2019ll catch you up to speed. \n\nFull Sail does a great job at getting you going, QUICK. I don\u2019t believe they have any courses that assume you\u2019re already advanced (undergrad speaking). \n\nI knew absolutely nothing about code, and now I am on my way to becoming a full stack developer, no joke.  \n\nI made the decision to go back to school myself at the ripe age of 28. I hold a degree from Ohio State, and soon Full Sail. \n\nI can honestly say I\u2019m enjoying my experience here so much better than I did there. However, I\u2019m an adult now with much better time management and I like moving at a fast pace. \n\nAnyway! The cool thing about getting my degree is that I too will have more doors that open within the company I work for. Fortunately for me I work for one of the largest tech companies in the world. One day I hope to be a Web architect for them! \n\nSo if it\u2019s fulfillment you seek and ultimately getting ahead and bettering yourself then I believe you may be exactly where you need to be.\n\nJust do me a favor, if you were going to commit give it your all. Whether you go to Full Sail, or another university just don\u2019t forget the reason you started.  \n\nCheers",

You will be expected to draw throughout the curriculum and that will be one of the first disciplines they encourage you to strengthen. And quite honestly, the skill that separates you from other designers.",

            "comment": "I graduate this Friday from the online graphic design program! They definitely don\u2019t expect you to have graphic design skills going in, they start with basics in using illustrator, other things like how to choose colors and typography as well, and it all builds from there. I can\u2019t speak much for the on campus version of my degree, but the online version has been decently paced - it\u2019s been trying to be in school and working full time, but I\u2019m so glad to have been able to receive my bachelors after two years instead of four. I will say, unfortunately a lot of the graphic design work is things that you could teach yourself, and essentially do by watching videos, but by choosing to go through the school you obviously have access to resources and real-time feedback from professors and then you of course do end up with a degree vs. not having one if you were to teach yourself. I hope my advice helps and things work out for you! And congrats on choosing to pursue this, I seriously wish you the best of luck! If you have any more questions I\u2019d be happy to help.",

I wish I would have taken more advantage of the resources provided to me while I was in the online program, but it was quite hard for me to attempt to dedicate hours and hours to reading some parts of material while needing to complete assignments and working full time. Full sail also has a career development branch that is there to help while graduating and after - once you\u2019ve graduated you can come back to them and ask the career dev team anything, any time.\n\nUnfortunately I didn\u2019t attend on campus so I can\u2019t really speak to cost of living expenses. However, I will say the school was able to help me secure scholarship funds to help cover some of the tuition.\n\nIt was very difficult sometimes, I won\u2019t lie. There were some weeks where I would get incredibly frustrated and stressed out, but when I had people around to support me through it, it really helped.",

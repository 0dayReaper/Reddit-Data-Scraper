Don\u2019t do anything stupid and don\u2019t hang around the wrong people and you\u2019ll be fine. Never had any issues myself or with friends who were female. Outside of campus is not determined by the school or its area, central Florida in general is \u201cgood\u201d unless you are again hanging around the wrong people. There are definitely more males then females at fullsail and that may affect the way you see the school as safe but other than that perspective aspect it is just like any campus.",

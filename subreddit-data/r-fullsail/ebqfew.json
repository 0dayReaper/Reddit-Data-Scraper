    "postText": "Im having second thoughts on going to full sail because a. The credibility of the school could ruin my future education if i decide to go to a different school to further my education (ie. A masters in game design) and b. The accelerated program wont give me all the knowledge i need for my career in game design that an actual 4 year college would give me since they take out some courses normal colleges would give or just shortcut them. These 2 defining factors are causing me to rethink my decision, but i love everything else and really want to go to the school because of everything else. So i came here to ask anybody in the program or anybody who is now working in this field. Are you happy with where you are, and have no regrets going to this school for this degree?",

            "comment": "I didnt get a design degree but i know some very successful designers that did. \n\n Let me start by saying 4 year schools are a waste of time and almost certainly cost more that FS here in the US. You absolutely can learn design in 2 years, and never need a masters or another degree. \n\nThat being said most design students dont know what design really entails. Its mostly coding with a focus on features and game play systems.\n\nSo if you arent interested in coding then maybe creative writing would be a better path.",

            "comment": "Sorry this is late, but thought I'd add thoughts for anyone questioning this. I think Full Sail is a great choice if you are like me- you don't get much out of going to a physical class, you have a high drive, and you are self sufficient. They teach you the basics, but if you want to be good, you need to work hard at it outside of class. You need to intern, network, and practice a lot. I personally attended three different top 4 year schools (I don't mean Harvard, but I mean most who applied do not get in) and I hated every minute of it. I was learning nothing, crying most nights, sleeping very little. I recall sleeping about 3 hours over the course of finals, and driving the few hours home was so bad I had to pull over and collect  myself a few times to continue. \n\nSo, to sum up: I think 4 year colleges are crap and scams unless you plan to be a doctor, lawyer, anything like that. Otherwise, get the skills and degree you need to enter the workforce 2 years sooner than you originally would have, save some money and stress and time. \n\n\\*\\* Side notes: I am not blown away by Full Sail, but I think they do really cool stuff and it's the future of colleges. We learn the latest, most up to date information, the technology you receive is unreal compared to other schools (Hint- you get nothing!). Being able to return and take a new class for free is really cool and important for continuing education. But there are things I am confused about it often. I attended a year and a half of regular college, and decided I would finish at Full Sail. The transfer credits were near impossible to figure out, then I started school and forgot about it until I was notified about my second year starting. I have been trying to figure out where I am in the program and have not gotten an answer yet, but I think that may be my fault for directing the question to the wrong department. I hate phone calls and advising doesn't seem to have an email.",

            "comment": "Not game design related but I really want to write a long response with my Full Sail experience but I dont feel like it right now so I'll post the TLDR version:\n\n Graduated Computer Animation in 2010. Absolutely loved the school. Was the only character animator to be shown at graduation ( I had a really good demo reel, was a good animator) Applied to job postings and every studio I could find all over the U.S. for 2 years, went to a few, got zero responses. Became very depressed about it and haven't looked back. I now have a very good job in a completely unrelated industry. If I could change things, I would have never went. I have been paying $1,000 a month to student loans and I will be paying for at least another 20 years, for a degree I could have taught myself from the internet. Not worth it.\n\nThe industry is the problem, not the school.",

Also i questioned the credibility, but im past that one because if i can get through full sail and at keast start in the job market, ill broaden my skills and go somewhere else for cs and other things to make my portfolio look a lot better.",

There are tons of free sources online that teach any language you want and even beyond that that can help you learn theory. The biggest part of learning is that you are the one doing it not someone teaching it to you. Also build projects that interest you it helps keep focus.",

I will be working on side projects, studying, and working so ill barely have time to also teach myself some languages. I will be putting my all into this college if i do go, i will want to know every little thing to help me go further into my career, so learning some languages on my breaks may be a good idea. Overworking myself is also a thing i have to take into account though, but im glad im not one to give up easily. Overall it's a decision ill have to make once i get there, but thank you for the tip.",

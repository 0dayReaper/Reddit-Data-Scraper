Just landed a senior animator position at a AAA dev.\n\nOnly paid my loans off recently by selling my house (bought when the market was way down,  fixed it up over 4 years, sold when the market peaked). If it wasn't for that,  id still be making payments. Loans are outrageous. The industry is cut-throat. Shoot for the stars, but consider yourself lucky if you end up settling for the moon.  Most don't even get to launch.  \n\nNot sure if metaphor works. Good luck tho",

I quit but she didn't and now she owes 60,000$ and can't find a job with her BA I got a certificate for free and applied for about 40 jobs in the year I got it and only got one interview that I didn't land. So yeah don't do it I got lucky and left my friend however I feel so bad for her right now. For reference I knew I probably wasn't going to get a job with it, I just wanted to get a feel with it and I'm now back in school with a different college working to become a teacher. \n\nIf you truly want to go into a trade you're better off going to a local trade school or getting a BA at a community college and learning your trade on youtube. It's all they will do anyway.",

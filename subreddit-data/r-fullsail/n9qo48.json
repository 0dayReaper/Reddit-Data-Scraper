    "postText": "What's going on everyone who reads this post. My name is Gavin, and I'll be starting by August 30th or earlier at Full Sail University. I will be talking to the housing department tomorrow, but I'd prefer to have a house close to campus that isn't directly affiliated. I like my privacy, but good company too! This post isn't just for me. It's for anyone who needs help with housing with cool individuals who are ready to get this degree and make something of ourselves, and be individuals but be a family as well. There is a lot to learn in this new stretch of our lives. I'm moving from Pennsylvania without knowing anyone in Florida besides one person for advice about the area. I'd like to be within 5 miles of the college, and if anyone wants to add me we can exchange social media titles and chat stuff out! I've been looking on Zillow a bit today; I'll continue to do so and see what the housing department says in terms of a nice spot with decent rent. I'm a really good cook, and can food plan for the house if necessary! I do enjoy gaming quite a lot, and writing music / being creative and doing tons of research! If I can find a 3 bedroom, I'd be happy with two roommates! My major will be Game Design, and I am set on staying for my Bachelors. I will be posting certain listings from various sources in hopes that I get a response &amp; some roomies who like the crib! I want a decent place to live if I'll be in Florida for two years, maybe more or less. Let's find some together! \ud83e\udd13 \ud83c\udfae \u2764\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9c\nInstagram : dopesmoked420\nDM if your interested!\nFree Monday - Wednesday, Sunday too.",

    "postText": "I learned today after several weeks of research and speaking with staff. I was strongly mislead about the program I wanted to do. The program I was picking is literally filled with filler classes. A waste of time and you get no real education. Im upset for the amount of time the administration lied, was uneducated with certain questions and refused to let Me speak to certain departments of the school and said I had to be a student first. I found ways around that. They have very childish policies. Do not do their online programs. They are literally designed to take advantage of you and your money and offer nothing in return. I was lucky enough today to speak with the military department for the school and they corrected all the lies the education/administration side was feeding me. Be very careful on what path you choose with that school.",

I never even imagined writing for games or short stories and I learned them all. Were the courses short? Yes. I wish I knew what questions to ask and what I really needed to get done in my portfolio and not just to pass the course. \n\nHowever, the school is not a scam as a whole. I enjoyed my time learning. I work full time and had to go to school online. My only regret is that I wasn't more aggressive with getting work done post graduation. I'm sorry you had that experience, but hopefully you find what you need elsewhere.",

Was told that even online students would be given opportunities to network and work together on projects\u2014namely that cinematography students would get chances to work with writing students on scripts and music students on scores.\n\nI have managed to make that happen, but not through any official school channels. There has been zero institutional-level support or facilitation of collaboration for the digital cine program. Which is a real shame because one of the biggest benefits to attending school for any creative field is the networking opportunities it can provide.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve said this in previous posts, but my experience with full sail was a joke. I almost always discourage people from going there when they ask. I did online. Not in campus. So it might be different there but overall. I knew more about what I was going to school for before I went there and I learned nothing. Most of my teachers barely spoke in full sentences and were very lackluster. Some didn\u2019t even speak English. It was almost like they hired anyone. Granted this was 2012/2013. Half the stuff they asked for, within the course that would be assignment completion I did without even looking at the corse work. It was a total waste of money and I got nothing out of it. I did go for music production and at the time was already producing albums and recording on my own. Since a lot of it was basic questions stuff that is googleable. I basically spent thousands of dollars for a MacBook Pro and a bunch of community college/highschool classes that credits wouldn\u2019t even transfer to an actual community college. After graduating and printing my pdf of my degree, no one would hire me. When asking most people said a college degree in my field was a joke and you needed hands on experience working from the bottom up (as an intern). Which is true to an extent but the degree did me no favors at all. As others have mentioned the alumni portal is always empty. It\u2019s not a scam but it\u2019s a joke college. The only good thing is does is tell jobs I\u2019ve applied to that I went to college for the sake of needing a college experience to get hired but I can say now that literally everything they teach for the course work both basic classic and music related ones are available for free on google from various teachers and YouTube.",

                            "comment": "In a comment in another thread you said you went to two other film schools. What exactly are you looking to learn/gain from attending a third film program?\n\nThe information about recording codecs and color depth *is* in some of the course material. It's covered briefly, almost \"blink and you miss it\" kinda info. I have my own suspicions on why that kind of technical information isn't covered in depth, but they're mostly speculation and not kind towards other students, so I won't elaborate beyond that here.\n\nThe Digital Cinematography program is **not** a typical film program. It can't be. A typical film program gives students on-set experience, albeit in a limited and controlled way. That's impossible to do in an online program with students spread all over the world. Rather, the Digital Cinematography program is more focused on giving students the tools and information needed to start out as a freelance commercial cinematographer/videographer (people have strong opinions about which term counts in which situations, I do not). That means a student who has paid attention in their classes will graduate and find themselves ready to take on work shooting commercials, small-scale projects, and documentaries.\n\n**THAT** is where I think the strongest case for Full Sail lying comes from. The Digital Cine program is advertised and talked about as though it is \"film school.\" It is not. It is a different beast entirely. \n\nIs it good? For some people, sure. Personally, I've learned quite a bit and feel like I've gotten something out of attending (I graduate in a few months). The work I've produced as a student has gotten me hired to shoot a few short films.\n\nBut it's not for everyone\u2014for a lot of reasons. The school is doing themselves a huge disservice by promoting the Digital Cine program as though it is a film school. I know a number of students who enrolled thinking it would be more like a typical film school, then dropped out a few months later, disappointed with the program. In talking with the admissions person, and then later the program director, I was able to put the pieces together and figure out what the nature of the program really is, before I enrolled. Presenting the program for what it is: a freelance cinematography/videography program, would benefit the school quite a bit, imo.",

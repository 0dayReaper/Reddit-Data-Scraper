I have dabbled in C# but nothing advanced and I\u2019m scheduled for a game development class for my senior year. Are these things good enough? Or what should I seek out to learn before hand?\n\nThanks everyone!",

I\u2019d also try Amazon\u2019s Lumberyard so you\u2019re familiar with another major game engine. They\u2019re probably the most commercial and most like what you\u2019d use in a AAA studio. \n\nClass wise, I\u2019d brush up on Math and Physics. Most of the core subject classes are pretty easy.

I don\u2019t want to shit all over FS in this Reddit because it seems to be full of fans of the school and I was looking for a sub that was more filled with realism of the situation. Keep this in mind: my bachelors is basically worthless and I can\u2019t easily get a masters anywhere but FS. I also have been on sets where I hear the same joke when people found out what school I went to \u201cohhhh, your the one guy who actually got a job after graduation?\u201d ",

They do have great equipment and facilities but the staff is a joke, and you won\u2019t have time to work on non-FS productions during school. The staff had so many people who graduated and started \u201cteaching\u201d with no real experience. If you looked at it as a tech school and had the money to blow its good to use all the gear, but not worth it when you pretend it\u2019s a real degree. ",

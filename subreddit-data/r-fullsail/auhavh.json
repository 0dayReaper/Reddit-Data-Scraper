If I drop out to fix my life up can I come back? Also what should I expect? Will I need to send back the computer and stuff from school?",

You pay for school in increments. So if you drop out you may be paying for classes you haven't taken yet. I would figure out what date you are payed up until than drop out then. If you want to take one or two months off, that would be easier as you wouldn't be dropping out technically. \n\nHowever, you should know that there is a certain amount of time you have to complete the degree before you have to retake classes. You already had because of how often the curriculum changes. This is all stuff your Full Sail rep should be able to tell you in greater detail. But be aware that they makenit their mission to not let you drop out. ",

I took a leave of absence and was struggling after returning. I ended up failing out around 3/4 of the way through my program. I was forced to leave Full Sail for a year. After the year was up, I asked to return and wrote a letter to them explaining what happened and why I had failed out. They granted me permission, and after a rough start upon returning, I did eventually make it through to graduation and got my B.S. degree. Your specific situation I couldn't speak on, but that is my experience. I would speak to a student advisor as soon as possible if I were you. Good luck.",

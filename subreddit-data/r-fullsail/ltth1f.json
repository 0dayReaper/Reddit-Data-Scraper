Essentially, everything is backwards of Windows (and that\u2019s where it gets frustrating, but remembering that can help). \n\nThe buttons on open programs are x, -, and +. X = close, - = minimize, and + = fullscreen. Instead of right clicks, you control or command click on on things (also, just learned this week that command click on links automatically opens it in a new tab, extremely useful). \n\nOther things to try and figure out are how to make your iPad a sidecar (a second monitor, love this feature), and the file navigation system. It\u2019s just different on Mac vs Windows and I can\u2019t explain it. I\u2019m still not used to it, and it\u2019s been a few years. I\u2019d definitely use OneDrive for all your school files because then it sort of makes the file organization like Windows and that\u2019s just a lot better. Unless it\u2019s a huge project, I haven\u2019t tried uploading those files to OneDrive, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s recommended or not, I just use an external drive.",

Yeah, I haven't used the iPad much since I got it since I have an almost brand new laptop that I was hoping I could use and just opt out of the one from school, but they said I couldn't. \n\nI have however learned that if I use certain stringed instruments on the music app that on it, I can not only call my partially blind cat directly where I am, but get immediately nommed on when she finds me...",

I had a Mac Book Pro purchased one year before my program began, but it only had 8GB ram, not 16GB. I love the upgrade though, it\u2019s so fast, and so nice. I remember when I began video editing on a Windows computer years ago and over two hours were dedicated to just rendering and exporting files. Now? Barely a few minutes. It\u2019s so nice, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll grow to love it.",

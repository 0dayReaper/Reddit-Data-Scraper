I wanted to know if they have payment plans for tuition. I currently have a enrollment agreement which states 11,000 due first month. I don\u2019t want to sign it unless I know I can pay it in smaller increments. Does anyone know if that\u2019s possible?",

They have fantastic financial aid, as well as grant information. \n\nFull Sail has been a HUGE learning experience, not only professional, but personally. It takes a lot to become an expert in your field, it takes more to be a professional expert. Full Sail encourages and requires the tough work it takes.",

Currently living paycheck to paycheck and don't have the 500 a month they want from me, so I'm trying to figure out a way I can do income based while moving to a better paying job. They sent me a packet that has all the info in it. And there's a campus portal you can sign in and make payments on too.",

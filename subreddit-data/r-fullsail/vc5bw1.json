Like how different loans/bank accounts would have different interest types and how to calculate that.\n\nOne of my best online experiences, the class was way more organized than many of my degree classes and my professor made it a point to have open communication. I think she was also the one who gave out her personal phone number if we had any questions. But that was my class/teacher.",

If you have ANY struggle in math, take it on campus. The prerecorded lectures remove the ability to ask for further clarification on the topics being covered, and you will end up trying to teach yourself these concepts.",

It may be different for everyone, but the first two weeks were easiest, I'm on the third week and it's a little harder but still not completely horrible. I don't think it's so much math, as it is logic.",

    "postText": "So I recently wanted to get back into full sail after withdrawing last month. \n\nBut i\u2019m really stuck because originally i wanted to do art for gaming. I felt writing was more of my expertise, but i\u2019m still not sure on which degree or certificate to take that would even be a game writer if game writing even exists. \n\nI\u2019m just not the best at art anymore, even when I was a teen i\u2019ve always loved to write but wasn\u2019t sure on what to do with the skills without creating a novel that i don\u2019t really plan to do.\n\nWhat should I do? Film and Video? Game Design? or Creative writing? Thanks in advanced.",

            "comment": "Game writing/ storyboard leads is a profession that absolutely does exist in video games, much as it does in sitcom show, movies, anime, etc. If that is what you want to do as a career, all the more power to you, the creative writing is probably one of the most solid degrees for that specifically.\n\nHowever, if your not exactly sure what you want to do, I would strongly recommend that you take some time to figure out what you want, especially now that you've had a taste of what Full Sail has to offer when it comes to classes and student life.\n\nIf you have a community College near you, check around to see if they got any courses you think might be in that field of interest, spend a semester just burning through them to see if you even like this kind of stuff, for the most part you'll save a ton of money. Alternatively, spend that time working some random job, doesn't matter what (though it's better if you can manage to get one in your field of interest) and pursue the field you think you want to build a career in on your own, via YouTube and online tutorials and such. You would be surprised how far you can get on your own if you have the drive for it.\n\nLastly, if none of these options sound appealing to you, I would just say bite the bullet, take a certificate class here, talk with the admissions team to see which one you want specifically, and do it.\n\nDeciding College majors is a really confusing time for way too many people (hell me as well), I feel strongly that there should be more of an emphasis on what outcomes different majors have in life, but often times schools expect everyone to know exactly what the students are getting themselves into.\n\nHope this helps.",

    "postText": "I was just given a lousy grade on a project because I was unable to find a group to do it with and had to do it on my own. I emailed my classmates (only 5) prior to find a group to work with, none of them replied. This is the second time this happened this month, now i\u2019m ending the class with a low 60.\n\n\nMy main gripe with this school is the experience. While you can blame this on Covid, it\u2019s completely unfair that there\u2019s no way to compensate us for an unfulfilling learning experience. I\u2019ve heard other schools are at least trying new things to make distance learning way more intuitive. I\u2019m in the business program and I know I could be learning most of this stuff on YouTube. The tests are as easy as copy pasting the question on quizlet in another tab. Teachers are fine I guess, but we have only 1 month to know them and none of them get a chance to really get personal and make a bond or impact. \n\n\nI have no friends here. I\u2019ve been here half a year, and I\u2019m not kidding when I say these have been the loneliest months of my life. E-mails on the FSO platform go nowhere because apparently i\u2019m the only one in this school who reads them. I Don\u2019t want to seem picky, but I really don\u2019t want to be friends with people who only want to play video games and do unproductive things all day!\n\n\nHopefully I\u2019m not the only one who feels this way. I came here for a unique, hands on business internship that\u2019ll teach me the industry and fulfill a fun, memorable learning experience with likeminded creative people. So far, i\u2019ve gotten none of that. Being unmotivated, i\u2019m just gracing by getting 70s and low 80s in most of these classes. Do I know the significance of a Full Sail degree in the future work force? Do I want to know?\n\nThe only truly great thing about here is that i\u2019m living without my guardians for the first time and learning how to live a life on my own. I had nowhere else to vent about this to, so here I am.",

            "comment": "Did you try e-mailing your teacher, via e-mail or the online FSU portal, to tell them the group project issue?  You say that everything is super easy and then say you've only been there six months.  You are still in the general education classes.  Things do get harder, I assure you.  As far as the gracing by: That's on you.  The school is responsible for teaching you, you are responsible for your motivation and work ethic.  They were also super open about the fact that since it's essentially a speed school each class was 4 weeks, and then it was on to the next class.  \n\n\nI am really baffled by \"I really don\u2019t want to be friends with people who only want to play video games and do unproductive things all day\" statement.  You picked a school that centers their entire self around technology.  Their most popular programs involve video games, music, and web development.  Why are you shocked that the vast populous of FSU are gamers and that is what they do with most of their time? The school has video game tournaments advertised on their webpage, ffs lol.  \n\n\nI'm quite enjoying FSU, but I have my gripes as well.  Most of it centers around the fact that it takes ages to get graded, sometimes two weeks.  That's a problem when my current week's work is dependent on a grade for a project from the week prior.",

Of course this school isn\u2019t responsible for my motivation, but they can at least give me things to be motivated for and make an attempt to cater to my experience as a student. Dont get me wrong, there\u2019s a time and a place for video games, but there not something I spend time with 24/7. Especially since I only play sports games.",

I love video games as much as the next person so I'm not shitting on it but that has seemed to be the topic of discussion among students in all of the chats during my live lectures. I hope your experience gets better.",

            "comment": "Hmmmm.... I don\u2019t feel the same way. Maybe it depends on the program. My program was online before COVID. I have no idea why we would ever be assigned a group assignment though. I live on the West Coast and the 9pm deadlines are my only gripe (why would it matter if I turned something in 3 hours later?) A group project would suck mainly because 5pm is 2pm for me (I literally miss every single lecture because I\u2019m usually at work, in the middle of a shift). \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re struggling in classes though. I find that the deadlines are forcing me to get work done. I\u2019m in Digital Cinematography and they mainly have us watching LinkedIn Learning videos to learn programs so I get the \u201cI could YouTube all of this,\u201d stuff. It feels that way sometimes, but I also know that if I didn\u2019t have a grade to work towards, I\u2019d be putting off a lot of these projects and would be getting as much done in the same amount of time.",

My undergrad I didn\u2019t really make any close friends until about 5 months in so I was so lonely and unmotivated. And with covid, which honestly for a \u201ctech advanced\u201d or whatever school they kinda suck at online learning. I personally am a pretty outgoing person and had friends by the time covid hit but a lot of my classmates definitely felt that there was no connections to be made with online learning and that half the zoom events unless they were something with a popular speaker, we\u2019re empty. I will say that both my degrees did get me some good gigs and I now have a job in marketing and social media but tbh it was my camera skills (YouTube university) that got me that job. I really hope your experience gets better but it sucks that a lot of my friends who were in school during covid definitely felt they missed out on a lot and it\u2019s obvious a lot of people feel this way. And I totally get the \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be friends with people who play video games\u201d gripe lol I had to literally go out of my way to find friends at UCF and Rollins who were down to do creative stuff because I only had a few friends at full sail who actually wanted to do music biz and creative things. I hope stuff gets better and that you find a group of friends who can make you feel welcomed.",

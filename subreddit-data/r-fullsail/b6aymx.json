    "postText": "I'm a prospective FS applicant in my junior year of high school, primarily thinking of going for a game design degree. However, after reading reviews about the school I'm can't seem to get a straight answer as the community seems about half and half on whether or not FS is... good? I've seen and heard (even from people I know personally) that going to FS was the best decision they ever made, blah blah; then I see the complete opposite and that it's a waste of money and such. I just want to get as much information as possible, so this question is meant for anyone who is currently attending or has attended FS (it would be helpful if in your reply you stated which you were). Is FS the right choice?",

For the money that you'll be putting into it you have to be ready to grind the whole way through, both in school work and marketing. Owning your craft outside of what they tell you to do, marketing yourself so when you leave you to have someone who knows your name and face and can put a good word in for you when job hunting. You're not guaranteed a job when you leave or the job you want so you have to really decide if the risk worth the reward. \n\nFor me, I don't need to go as I'm a mobile dev and I can learn all I need for free far less off skillshare and things of the like but I want the experience, to be out of my small town, to be around people who like what I like, to learn in person and have this whole new look of the world. However, for the price it will cost for me I can't do it.  The work I can handle I love pressure but that what happens after is something out of my control and too costly.  \n\nIt's easy for me to say, ill go and grind my way to the end then pick up a job where I can pay off 80 grand over 10 years or something but life is so unpredictable.

Count up the grads since it started and that is a big pot of people. \n\nI would give this advice to anyone looking at any school. Figure out the job or family of jobs you want to do and work backwards from there. Reach out and find people doing that job you want to do. In addition to finding out the pay range (cause you need to know if you are going to make enough to afford any school, public or private) also find out what degrees (if any) they hire from and which schools have good reputation for those degrees.\n\nThat's going to tell you where you need to go and what you need to study. \n\nIn addition the Dept of Labor posts things like graduation rates and job placement numbers on schools and their degree programs so you can check out how successful students are at graduating a program and how well they are able to get a job in the industry. Google search should turn this up fairly quickly.",

You can get the same degrees at community/accredited colleges that won't leave you in debt for several dozen years if not a life time.",

You can get all the information from Full Sail from Reddit and tutorials online. If you need someone to light a fire under you to actually learn those things FS is an expensive way to do that. You also make contacts from FS but you can do that with Game Jams etc.\n\nGame companies care more about your skillset than a degree. A good Reddit sub is r/gamedesign and r/gamedev. Good luck with your choice.\n\nWent to FS online for Game design. Graduated five years ago. Need any other info feel free to comment or DM",

Hopefully if they happen to confiscate a bike while arresting somebody for another broken law, they will call you up.\n\nI had a classmate get mugged while walking to a 1pm class. He knew who the people were and the cops did nothing, so might want to look into getting an alternative.",

Also some of the pawn shops sell twenty dollar bikes, they are crappy and look bad, but at-least no one will steal it because it's crappy, and if they did, it's only twenty dollars.",

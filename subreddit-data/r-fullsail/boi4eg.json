    "postText": "So first of all I have about 4 years experience in 3d art as a hobby, I have experience in modeling, animation, composition, lighting, physics, material setups, etc. I spend a lot of time, at least 5 hours a day working on stuff and trying new things. This is something I have a passion for as something I want to do whether someone tells me to do it or not. When my friends are playing video games, I'm working on scenes or assets, etc.\n\nMy point is, I put a lot of time into this already and highly enjoy it, so I'm wondering what being in either the computer animation or game art course will be like for someone like me. I want to be better than my classmates. I am very competitive in this aspect. I want to take the class projects and go above and beyond what I am asked to do. What should I expect to find challenge in? \n\nI also work 12 hours a day on a Panama schedule 40hrs a week. Will this be a huge challenge for someone in my position?\n\nAlso if I take the classes one at a time as needed, do I still get the launch box?",

            "comment": "I think you would do great in the classes once you get past the slow paced stuff(core classes). I\u2019m in my 3rd class and haven\u2019t had an issue with keeping up with the course work (I work 54 hours a week and have 2 kids). \nIf you didn\u2019t already know how to do a lot of the stuff I\u2019d say your biggest challenge would be managing your time learning a new craft, but you seem to be in good shape there. They give you a pretty nice layout of your work week and balance it in a way you can get the easier stuff out the way first. \nYou would still get the launch box. I can\u2019t really speak to much on the computer animations degree because I\u2019m not in it and I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s challenging but I feel like with your experience you wouldn\u2019t have any issues what so ever. Good luck!",

So it\u2019s not hard, but can still be very time consuming. 3D Foundations was pretty easy, but Model Creation was super time consuming because of the workload. It\u2019s still definitely worth it, but you\u2019ll never really be able to just skate by.\n\n~ forgot to mention, I work full time in IT, so my experience comes with balancing work and assignments. If you\u2019re just a full time student, it\u2019s definitely much easier. It\u2019s certainly doable, but it\u2019ll take some will power.",

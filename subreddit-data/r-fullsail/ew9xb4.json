    "postText": "Hello, I am a vet looking to attend Full Sail in the near future. I was wondering if there were any vets/students/alumni with any opinions on the experience as a whole. I have taken the tour already, but that was two years ago. I am interested in the Music Production bachelor's. So I was wondering if there were any things (big or small, positive or negative) that stands out to you about the experience. For example: Best areas to live (staying in winter park or worth it to maybe live 10-15 min away downtown or more central to Orlando), cost of living, tempo of the school's curriculum, campus life (gym on campus?), student-instructor experience, is it realistic to not have a part time job while going through school, etc. Also, I'll be down this weekend to browse some apartments, is there anything going on this weekend at the university that would be cool to check out? I was hoping to get fellow vet's opinions regarding use of GI Bill and other things if possible. I went back a year through threads but haven't quite seen stuff that answers some of my questions. Thanks in advance.",

It\u2019s a good program (I do online) but honestly not worth the money. I\u2019m switching to music production in March actually and I\u2019ll be getting a second launch box which is pretty sweet. Luckily the post 9/11 GI bill covers all costs so tuition cost doesn\u2019t really matter. If I had to pay out of pocket, I would not attend this school tbh. \n\nBut with the post 9/11, you get free school and free gear when you get your launch box. And since they have accelerated programs, you can get your bachelors degree and still have some months left over on your GI Bill. I\u2019d recommend the school to fellow vets and there are actually a lot of vets attending the online courses. A couple active duty I\u2019ve seen as well. \n\nFeel free to ask me any questions you may have and I\u2019ll answer to the best of my ability. This sub is pretty dead but I\u2019ll help you out as much as I can!",

I was looking at both but they only offer Music Production on campus. And yea, only reason I'm willing to go is because it's covered by the GI Bill. Did you have any luck with other Scholarships or financial aid through either Full Sail or the VA?",

                            "comment": "I think the audio production is a little different than the music production. The audio one is geared more towards recording audio other than music and the music program has more courses geared specifically towards recording and mixing music. \n\nThey will have you apply for fafsa, as every school in the US does and since the GI bill will cover all costs of the school, you can use the money awarded through fafsa as a living expense. I received 4 different checks for $1600 from the pell grant if I remember correctly and you don\u2019t have to pay it back. Basically free money and that\u2019s on top of your MAH and book stipend. There are scholarships that the school offers too which can be seen on their website. I don\u2019t know much about them but it couldn\u2019t hurt to apply. More free money if you get approved \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

            "comment": "I went for film 10 years ago and my schedule would vary month to month, not really allowing me to find a part time job. I did have financial aid so I qualified for the work study program where you can intern for classes, work the old book store \u201cthe distro\u201d, or work in the labs for up to 30 hours a week. \n\nI signed up for a gym at the beginning but I got a gf(now wife), spent extra time doing projects or work study for the money, never really could go consistently(also fat at the time).\n\nI lived down the road a few miles, farther than a lot of kids lived when I went so I could live cheaply. Very ghetto neighborhood at the time in Casselberry. This methed out old white lady kept trying to get in my apartment once, this is bringing back memories haha.\n\nHonestly? The instructors were pretty cool but you could sense a lot of \u201csame shit, different month\u201d mentalities due to how fast the rotations are. Some of them really cared and would invite you to outside projects for experience. \n\nIf you\u2019re not paying very much or anything at all like that Vet in the thread, do it. If you need to take our massive student loans like I did? Don\u2019t. The school cuts a lot of corners with cranking the kids out every month that they make passing classes too easy. Sometimes it feels like you aren\u2019t being challenged in that aspect. But you truly do get what you put in. I worked my ass off there and still do, I\u2019m done with my loans and I\u2019m in a profession related to what I studied there. And I met my wife. So I would do it all over again.",

Yea, I'm a little worried about the \"diploma pipeline\" of just pushing folks through and collecting their money, but a common theme seems to be what you said that it'll only be as rewarding an experience you as you make by putting the time in and what not. Any yea, I come from section 8 housing so I am not very interested in returning to a ghetto area, but the average rent out there is expensive!!! Which I why I'm curious if it's worth it to just pay an additional 100-200 bucks to live in orlando or closer to it (more to do and more central to the area, assuming there isn't much to do in Winter Park that is) then some of the winter park apartments sponsored by the school. Plus, I'm up there in age and do not want a roommate at all lol. Thanks again for input!!! Glad to hear you were able to meet your Wife and make a career out of it!!!",

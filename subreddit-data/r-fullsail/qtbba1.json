    "postText": "   I think we've all been through discussions and absolutely hate them, but when it comes to creative writing it feels so much worse. I don't have a problem with reading others stories nor do I have a problem giving or receiving constructive criticism... but I hate it when someone skims through my work and responds. Basically our class theme is road trips and we had to choose which genre we wanted to write our story in I chose mystery. My peer, decided to give me a feedback and the feedback was just insulting because they clearly did not read my story. For example, they said my character was questioning the woman to solve a murder scene on the cliffs... there was no murder scene on the cliffs. I read back to see where they could have gotten this from and I made a friend and my mom read it and both said they didn't get that it was a murder scene either. Theres more to this, it's just irritating to see people skim through work in a creative writing class and then respond as if they knew what they were talking about. If they had said hey this part lacked over here so I would reccomend such and such that would've been better than, hey this was confusing, didn't make sense, (yes they did say that). I just want the professors to see this and call them out on it.",

I took computer science and am wanting to code, and I specifically chose Full Sail as a way to network with some of those people. i actually wish they had a chat instead of assignment discussions.",

Like if thats gonna be the case we minds well have a chat instead of a discussion so we can get more accurate information from our peers.",

I went to scad before I transferred and it was a ton of discussions and it's even worse if you're a weak drawer because everyone will take the easy route and go to you because to give constructive criticism/ advise to someonewho makes the most mistakes. My mother is in medical school (PIMA) and they have to do discussions for everything including math and sometimes politics and she has been attacked because of that discussion,  UT once again the professor did nothing. Like I get that it's another way to grade and help us in our careers, but I do not feel comfortable telling someone that what they did could have been better and I damn sure don't like it when someone tries to correct me on something they didn't even fully pay attention to. The instructors need to get a hold on that.",

I really really wish I had this drive to learn when I was younger, so yeah\u2026 it kinda bums me out when I see people half ass their post or clearly just not take enough time to read mine before responding lol. I will say this though, I get it. Some people are busy and discussions aren\u2019t everyone\u2019s main focus, you know? \n\nSo I guess at the end of the day it is what it is for me lol",

I've been wandering around the planet for a decent amount of time, and I know busy work when I see it, and the discussion posts are just that. The thing I think makes it so bad is the forced replies. I can't name how many times I've just not replied because I had absolutely nothing to say.\n\nNow with something like creative writing I can see how they could be more useful. However, I can also see how it could be a dumpster fire at a tire factory that also moonlights as a sh\\*t factroy. One of the things I've always told people about constructive criticism is to remember it's completely up to you what merits it holds in relation to your work. In short, don't like it? F\\*ck 'em, take your doctor bag, and move on.",

My unpopular opinion on the matter is that most see them as a waste of time to their own detriment. \n\nFor me, the discussion are an actual opportunity to exercise analyzing and finding problems to make solutions to (in visual design) so I put a great deal of effort to producing something that is worthy to critique. \n\nUnfortunately, people do the least amount of work expected of them and it shows both in the response and their projects. If I were you, I would not sweat it and move forward knowing you did the best you could. And whether or not they see it, it doesn\u2019t negate that fact.",

In the unfortunate event that they don\u2019t get reviewed by then I\u2019ll start March 29th. \nAside from all that, I\u2019m really looking to connect with other students who will be taking graphic design at Full Sail. Let me know when you are starting and what motivated you to do graphic design!",

I've noticed there are a lot of the negative reviews that are clickbait attached to the Coding Academies links.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would love to hear honest reviews about the program. Will, it set me up for success?",

In my experience, I had to take some classes twice (it is free to retake a class after failing unless you fail for attendance) but I didn't mind it because I learned the subject better. Also you will probably wanna do extra stuff, not just the class and labs to network.\n\nI went for GameDav/Sim-Vis by the way.",

I went to FS many years ago, but went back to college and got a bachelors in CS from a state university. Though I learned some coding and theory in my university, I really taught myself web development and was easily able to land a job in it (this was back in 1999 though). That said, a degree from FS doesn't make the difference here, especially when considering the price tag. I would recommend a BS in CS from a state school. Which, by the way, nothing wrong with taking four full years to complete college. Looking back, I'm happy I did that and really enjoyed my years at the university. Full Sail was a huge blur that went way too fast and covered things so quickly that most of that technology was obsolete in a couple of years. IMHO, not worth it.",

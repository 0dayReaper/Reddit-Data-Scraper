The thing is: as a producer you have to put money into your accreditation whether you like it or not. From a financial perspective that sucks, but from a knowledge perspective it makes sense. You have to pay (unfortunately) for what you learn. Point blank simple.",

            "comment": "I graduated Full Sail University in October of 2021. I attended FS for nearly 3 years doing online courses and received my Bachelors Degree in Game Art. I have 3 kids, worked a full-time job, and was the only working adult in my household\u2014food stamps, Medicaid, the whole 9 yards. I had to retake several classes (for personal reasons) and took a month off at the beginning of the pandemic to get my kids accustomed to virtual schooling. Those 3 years were nothing if not a struggle, and that\u2019s understating, if I\u2019m being honest. I thought about dropping out, I thought about saving money, I thought about quitting\u2026 but I powered through.\n\nFor me, Full Sail was a way to achieve my dreams. Now, I work for Ubisoft as an Art Integrator and I get to do what I love every single day, for a company I never imagined in my wildest dreams I\u2019d actually get the opportunity to have a career with, being part of a team of people who are just like me, and I couldn\u2019t be happier or more grateful.\n\nI never once felt like my interactions with anyone from Full Sail were anything akin to business transactions whatsoever. Is it a for profit college? Yep. And, in my personal opinion, they earned every single penny they got out of me, and every future penny I will be more than happy to pay in order to give my support to a college that fostered my dreams and taught me the skills I needed to succeed and that I hope will do the same for others for years to come. In 20+ years of wanting to know how to put my artistic skill to use in the games industry, and attending other notable colleges along the way (Berea College, for instance), Full Sail was the only school that put me on the right path.\n\nTL;DR Yes, Full Sail is a for profit college and absolutely worth every dime, in my experience.",

I gotta say that there are other options to get this kind of knowledge and with the amount of money you spend in Full Sail, you can literally start a professional music studio. That being said, I learned SO MUCH at full sail. I got to play around with high end gear and Grammy award winners professors. Some of the classes were bullshit to me tbh, but there were a few classes that took me up so many levels. It\u2019s amazing what you can learn in a month there. I would say that it might not be worth the money unless you are already a wealthy person (like most students there). Most stories of grads that make it big after full sail are people with a lot of resources and privileges, not all of them of course, but yeah the vast majority.\n\nPersonally, if I could travel back in time I would probably decline full sail and go to a different school, I don\u2019t completely regret it because I learned so much there, but I remember considering different schools back then that were cheaper and I bet I would have learned as much there as well.\n\nBtw OP if you are really down to learn, I work teaching workshops and tutoring people who wants to step their game on audio. Hit me up! I like to support newcomers.",

I\u2019m in CS but all the equipment is good either way. You can look up your program on FullSails page for exactly what you\u2019ll get. Most people online get their equipment after their 3rd or 4th class.",

Just be prepared to do a lot of voice recording memo type stuff in Creative Presentation. Psychology of Play is a lot of discussions and reading, but it\u2019s more \u201cstrict\u201c than my month one. Not strict as in the teacher but the content and coursework. You have to do the \u201cquests\u201d a certain way and your discussion post is 100 words for each question, usually 3. There\u2019s A LOT of reading and TED Talks to listen to but I just skip those since the reading is basically the exact thing the 20 minute video discussed. Hope this helps!",

            "comment": "So, I originally worked full time and did the online course for media communications. I have since switched majors to film and moved to Orlando to take classes on campus. This is my experience:\n\nWith the Online Courses, it is very very doable if you manage your time correctly. However, I personally did not get as much out of the online course as I am being in campus. Furthermore, I think there are better online colleges for base computer science than FS. Don\u2019t get my wrong, I love going here, but it\u2019s better for specialized fields such as video game development or creative fields like film. If you\u2019re just wanting to do comp sci, maybe look at a local college where you can get in state tuition or an online college like ASU that will probably offer a better computer science program.",

She begins working today actually, so we\u2019ll get to see how hard it really will be.\n\nLuckily we\u2019re web degree so our work stacked on top of being a lab tech isn\u2019t TOO much extra work, but she\u2019s still anxious x)\n\nGood luck today babe, rooting for you\n\nEdit because nobody else has said it: Full Sail is a 40 hour commitment weekly, as far as I know regardless of degree or level of difficulty. Instructors expect a full-time gig\u2019s worth of effort done in a week, for each of their courses.\n\nFull Sail is one of the most challenging tech schools out there, and not always for the best reasons. I told a friend the other night that my experience was like an anime fight where the hero dies twice and ends up beating the final boss with his own blood for a weapon.\nIt\u2019s that tough.",

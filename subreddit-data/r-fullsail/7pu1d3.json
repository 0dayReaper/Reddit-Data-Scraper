            "comment": "Hard question to answer because there's two outcomes of this.\n\nI'm a graduate of this program, and I will say that 90% of my class is employed in the field. The program when I attended was solid, and we had some great opportunities to get work experience. I've worked on some huge shows with some big bands that I will never forget. \n\nMy first job ever was working a Nightwish show and I remember being so nervous as it was my 3rd month in and I didn't yet get to any actual classes and felt like I'd screw something up because the bands crew was giving me stuff to do like I've been doing this my whole life.\n\nThe thing is, you'll study with a lot of people who think they're the shit and think that everything should be handed to them on a plate just because they go to Full Sail and had such and such experience and met so and so at the Hall of Fame and go out there and act that way towards employers, and future co-workers.\n\nAnd so, some of these people are opinionated about Full Sail graduates because most of these people didn't get a degree to do this, they just started their way up as a stagehand. \n\nEither option is fine, if you want a diploma and to learn in an environment like that, it's great. You get to use all the latest gear, and learn how it's done, I had a lot of fun. You'll get experience you can't get anywhere else.\n\nBut you will go out into the field and meet people who are opinionated about Full Sail and make fun of it and it's graduates so that's the only draw-back, dealing with that. \n\nThere's a great careers department that keeps in touch even years after graduation to make sure you're employed and see if you need assistance with that. Also you have a final show that you present and various employers come and check it out and find potential people to hire.\n\nWhen I graduated both Disney and Universal reps were there watching our show and had a huge hiring spree. \n\nThe other thing, I've heard there's been a lot of changes since I left. I had some friends at school that were far behind in classes so they told me they were changing the structuring of the classes and it wasn't necessarily better. But I didn't experience this first hand so I can't tell you for sure what it's like now. ",

    "postText": "I\u2019m just 2 months in for computer animation for context. \n\nI got a email saying I\u2019m getting a \u201ctechnology package\u201d  Wednesday. Their Launchbox FAQ says my degree is bachelors and I should get it after the four core classes. I got my student loan invoice and the degree is undergraduate according to that. Undergraduates get the whole thing after 2 months I believe. I\u2019m wondering what to expect in the package and if I\u2019m in the undergraduate or bachelors category. Seems like I fit into both!  Hope that made sense. Kind of hard to explain \ud83d\ude05",

If you have additional stuff beyond that for your program, it depends.\n\nBut I would expect you're getting the iPad at this point and nothing more.",

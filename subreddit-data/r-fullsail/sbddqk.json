If you are over that but under 70% then you take a Pre-Calc and Calculus course in months 2 and 3 respectively. \n\nHow comfortable are you in math? Because the math courses later in the program get substantially more difficult and 4 weeks is a short time to learn advance mathematics. \n\nFor perspective, I am a Month 15 CS Student at Full Sail.",

We get spurts of the \"is it worth it\" posts when Fullsail recruits and I'd like to be able to point people to a single space. I may put it in a wiki, or I may leave it in this post. I know I'll probably end up compiling most of it and linking to it automatically when asked.",

            "comment": "Hi there, I'd be happy to contribute. I graduated from the Computer Animation on-campus degree program recently. I made a lot of online student friends that have shared their opinions as well so hopefully I can offer a somewhat decent perspective of the program as a whole.\n\n**PROS:**\n\n* Utilization &amp; teaching of legitimate industry-standard software to prepare you for the industry, none of the taught software felt like unimportant fluff. \n* No artistic background required (but it absolutely helps).\n* The majority of the instructors are professionals with a long history of prior industry experience, several of the animation-specific instructors are Disney Animation veterans.\n* (Campus-specific) In-person project feedback extremely accessible.\n* The degree program teaches you each role within a standard 3D pipeline for both feature animation and games, allowing you the opportunity to explore what truly interests you before choosing your speciality/discipline.\n* The majority of the projects are all very rewarding to accomplish and you can feel tangible progress in your skill level as you continue through the program.\n* (Campus-specific) Strong networking opportunities; campus career fairs, \"Hall of Fame,\" and even the classroom. Make friends and help each other improve! \n\n**CONS:**\n\n* Lack of cross-discipline collaboration\n* Career Counseling services are not helpful in job acquisition, just resume/LinkedIn tips\n* A few \"bad apple\" instructors that do a poor job of communicating &amp; providing feedback. Sometimes online students would send instructors a question about a problem they were having and have literally received a reply saying \"Hey \\_\\_\\_, looks good.\" A more rare occurrence, but it does happen. \n* Once your 3D Animation discipline is chosen, you have 3 months/3 classes to whip together a demo reel with 3 brand new projects to showcase your skills. 1 month is not enough time to conceptualize, storyboard, animate and polish a shot... So most student work in the final showcases appears largely un-finished, most students end up continuing to polish their reel shots post-graduation. \n* If your chosen discipline is character animation, other online schools might be more cost-effective and provide significantly better preparation for the industry as they are completely animation-specific (i.e. AnimSchool, Animation Mentor) with a strong proven track-record of graduate employment.",

I am also currently enrolled in the Instructional Design and Technology Masters program. I *do not* currently work in the industry, but that is mainly by choice. Many of the people I graduated with do work in the industry, and those who worked extraordinarily hard work on AAA film projects.  \n\n\nI am confident I could join the industry at any time if I chose to due to the networking I was able to do as a campus student and the resources available as a graduate. I have many close friends who work at big studios and have been told, \"If you audit \\[the compositing class\\], you should be able to get an entry-level job where I am\" multiple times. It is incredibly valuable*incredibly valuable* to know someone in the industry and be up-to-date on current technology, and Full Sail, especially on campus, does a great job of building those relationships and maintaining those skills.",

So I\u2019ll add on additional context:\n\nPros:\n\nI had a decent understanding of a large variety of programming disciplines upon graduation. This allowed me to be a generalist in my first job, getting really well rounded experience. \n\nIDE choices were industry standard, and you learn how to use the debugger. This is not something every CS graduate comes away with. \n\n3D Math was exactly what I needed for work, and job interviews. \n\nI was well prepared for gameplay programmer programming tests. \n\nCons:\n\nI picked up a lot of bad habits that were fundamentally bad engineering practice. Something most CS students lose during internships. \n\nCompeting against kids with internships for jobs was harder. \n\nI lacked some core CS fundamentals that came up in early interviews.",

Support when you have issues.\n\nCons they tell you you can get a \"pass\" for some classes with a simple phone call but it's really a song and dance to get that handled. Networking while going online. There is no real networking after class classmate don't really respond if your not participating in things to network. The surprise two classes in one month lol. \n\nHad two bad teacher experiences when I was getting my bachelor's one seemed to not like men of color and the other was definitely going through some shit at home it got to the point I was about to tell them to go get laid lol And I don't really contact teachers but when those two gave their feedback for assignments it was very different and awkward.",

There was zero creativity involved in the class, it was basically following a tutorial step by step. Other than that a big thing is teachers don\u2019t give any meaningful feedback. It\u2019s just a generic copy and past txt they send to everyone. People may respond to that with:\u201d well professors have a hard job and have a bunch of assignments to get through\u201d but isn\u2019t that exactly what teachers who teach in person do?",

He is the second worst teacher for me.  He said in some feedback a threat basically saying he will not let me move forward due to how I did the work before.  I was very worried about that but luckily I am well passed that class and that guy now.

Nobody was able to figure that out for some bloody reason.\n\nThere is only one who to use adobe class there should be a lot more.\n\nThe lighting class should be before comp and vis\n\nThere is probably more but I can\u2019t remember any of it off my head.",

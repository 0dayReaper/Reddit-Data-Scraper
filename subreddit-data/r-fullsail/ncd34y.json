    "postText": "In the past year I discovered that what I want to do with my life is make movies. I enrolled in full sail and started classes in early May. I\u2019m taking classes online and working full time so it ain\u2019t easy but nothing will stop me from reaching my goals. I\u2019m looking to network and scope out other people with similar goals or even people taking the same classes. I live in NC and just recently made a (very) short film for a festival. What\u2019s up??",

And I didn\u2019t place but it was a really fun experience! They only gave us a weekend to make, edit and post the film so there wasn\u2019t a lot I could do but I\u2019m still glad I did it!",

I\u2019d say the hardest class was Scriptwriting Techniques, it\u2019s a lot more technical than the other classes, and the late policy quiz is weighted (I don\u2019t read that stuff since I don\u2019t turn things in late, so I answered questions wrong. Stupid thing to lose points on). Art History was also a bit challenging, but once I found the button to listen to  the book instead of just reading it, all that information was easier to digest!",

Also, I used to live one state below you (SC), but, my wife, son, and I moved back to Georgia. I have no friends with similar goals at all, so feel free to friend me up!",

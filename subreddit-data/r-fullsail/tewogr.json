I hope if you are in the future you get the M1, honestly i hope it changes in the next few weeks and I get the M1, there is documentation on the one.fullsail portal about windows via bootcamp maybe that is why.  \n\nHigh key disappointed at the amount of headroom performance being left off the table\n\nEdit: I messed up with the numerical date march is in fact not the 5th month",

Even at that I would rather send full sail money out of pocket for more storage and memory. the processor is fine, I\u2019m still rocking an 8700k on my personal machine with no substantial performance loss. When I get it I\u2019ll milk it for content with an unboxing and  a performance testing for video editing and blender renders vs my 5-7ish year old pc that could be built today for way under what you pay full sail.

Most of the ones today are garbage anyway outside of Bit defender/Malwarebytes. But even those are unnecessary if you're not downloading sketch stuff. I know windows defender is great for windows.

            "comment": "I enrolled in the DCBS program and have so far, completed 4/7 of the certificate courses listed. If you are interested in cinematography, I'd recommend you check out a [Maine Media workshop](https://www.mainemedia.edu/workshops/online-workshops/) or Vancouver Film School's offering instead: [https://vfs.edu/programs/online/film-production-certificate](https://vfs.edu/programs/online/film-production-certificate). That is if you need instructor-led training as (by its nature) Full Sail online is predominantly watching pre-recorded or YouTube video content. If the latter is more helpful due to scheduling, check out: [https://www.filmskills.com/online-courses/](https://www.filmskills.com/online-courses/).  Any one of these is more cost effective. If your lucky one of these will feature a known cinematographer. My VFS' one-minute film assignment has been in 9 festivals, so far with a 50% acceptance rate.\n\nI'd also recommend [FilmSkills screenwriting course](https://www.training.filmskills.com/fst/course/screenwriting) if that is of interest. To be fair, FSU's screenwriting course is more format versus story-centric. The Screenwriter's Bible is their textbook and available for purchase. \"Dr. Format Tells All\" is also a nice screenwriting resource.\n\nFrom a New Media Tools and post-production perspective, you can make do with YouTube tutorials. In fact, the course chair hosts his own [training materials online](https://visitpete.com/). Note that FSU focuses on Adobe's Creative Cloud products and its included with your tuition. Sans enrollment and if a monthly subscription is too much, you can use Davinci Resolve for free. Also, they have amazing walkthrough tutorials on their YouTube channel. I've used Adobe CC and Davinci for a few years, so assignments were easy. In fact, I completed all NMT's month lessons and assignments in the first four days.\n\nIf you are complete beginner, maybe check out [Raindance's 99 minute Film School](https://raindance.org/courses/99-minute-film-school/). It's only $30 and will give you a sampling of what you need to focus on. However, you'll have to get up early to attend online as its in London. If you've shot a few films, any [Neil Oseman Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/user/neil-oseman/) or [Shane Hurlbut's Filmmaker Academy](https://watch.filmmakersacademy.com/catalog) is where you should spend your cash.\n\nTo be clear, I am not speaking negatively about FSU or their DCBS program. My opinions are viewed from a cost perspective. I have also completed all the recommended trainings, so these are not blind recommendations. The DCBS program has helped me grow as a filmmaker, but I put a lot into my assignments. Yet, if I didn't have use or lose, expiring GI educational benefits covering this... I wouldn't go in debt to attend Full Sail.",

Funnily enough, most of the resources you mentioned I have been looking at myself the past few months and asking myself whether it was worth the money. The Maine Media workshops and VFS caught my attention most as I felt I would benefit from the live Zoom classes and they seemed to be the most organized. Did you take all of VFS\u2019s online programs (Cinematography, Directing, Producing)?\n\nI\u2019ll definitely look into Raindance and that Udemy course.\n\nI\u2019m on the cusp of actually traveling abroad and applying to film schools in Europe as I found some schools that would be more cost-effective \u2014 just trying to find the most cost-effective method of learning the craft.",

I was fortunate that DP Thomas Burstyn (Netflix Cowboy BeBop &amp; AMC Hell on Wheels) thought the VFS cinematography course, which was the only one I took. As such, I'd keep an eye out for those announcements versus blindly registering.   \n\n\nAttending a film school in Europe at least, softens the financial blow as you're getting more worldly experience. I lived in Germany for a few years and those are great memories for me. Best of luck!",

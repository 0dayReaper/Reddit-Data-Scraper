I worry about that, but I keep thinking about all the connections Full Sail has and where alumni have made it to, and just hope it'll carry over to the online programs. I don't see why not, right?",

The studios/companies I've spoken to personally have been very \"it's all the same\" in terms of when I specify I was an online student. A lot of companies, Disney included, are very familiar with the curriculum and are aware that the material is nearly identical. ",

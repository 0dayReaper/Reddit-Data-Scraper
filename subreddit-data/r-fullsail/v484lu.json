    "postText": "Hi I am talking to someone about applying for the online course for the bachelor's in audio engineering/production course. Some of my friends are saying it's not an accredited school and people hiring will just look at my degree like it's not even there. Is this true and is the course worth it? I'm already working full time and would be dedicating my evenings to the classes and schoolwork and if it's all a waste of time I don't know if I should try...",

It all comes down to the work in your portfolio &amp; your ambition/attitude... If you have stellar work (and a good personality), you'll get hired. The degree won't matter. \n\nSpeaking as a current on-campus animation student with a few months left 'till I graduate. The pandemic really messed up my mental health and I'm extremely introverted these days and suffering because of it. I'm running out of time to make those connections, etc etc.. \n\nBasically what I'm trying to say is you need to be a personable go-getter.",

I have a legit bachelors of science degree on my resume, I\u2019m a game Art grad btw.\n\nFull Sail is definitely worth it, even just for the networking and career center resources when you graduate. Education wise it\u2019s good, but you only get out of it what you put into it. I had plenty of classmates who just barely managed to skate by and graduate, and yet can\u2019t model a professional grade character or prop, you have to really do the work if you want to actually be employable and good at what you do.",

So far my impression is that it works for the people who actually go and try to learn. I would be an online only student so I'm sure I won't see much of the campus life but as for the classes I'm sure will get a similar experience just online",

(I'm show production so I have some classes that you'd take)",

You're better off learning via YouTube and other resources, if this is the case. Also, as the first person posted, it really does come down to being a go-getter and having a solid portfolio. Industry professionals, especially in this field, don't care about a degree, they care about the work you've done.",

No Gen Eds, No sucky essays, everything applies to the real world of Audio. It is full in person in Arizona, with 24 hour access to campus and free range of equipment. I is renowned around the country for being THE BEST Audio Engineering School in the Nation.  This place has such a great community on top of it all and the teachers really care. They teach Music Production, Live Sound, Video Game Audio, Movie Music/Foley, Applied Post Production, Broadcast, and General Audio Engineering.",

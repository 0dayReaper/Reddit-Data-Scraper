I have a degree from the Ohio State University, and I\u2019m working on my Web Development degree from Full Sail. I value both my degrees the same. Every employer I\u2019ve come across will value my degrees the same. Paper does not define you. Regardless of what some douche from UC Berkeley might tell you on /college. However, when it comes to higher learning, national accreditation sometimes isn\u2019t accepted as widely as a regional. As a result, you may find it challenging to find a program that will take FS\u2019s  credits/degree.\n\nIf pursuing higher learning past your bachelors is your goal, just take some time to research the end results you want. \n\nI\u2019m perfectly happy with what Full Sail has offered me so far. Skills are like tools, They won\u2019t build a house for you, but in your hands they can create anything you desire. If you\u2019re willing to work. \n\nNot a paid advertisement. Lol",

    "postText": "Can someone tell me the specs for the MacBook Pro we will receive? I have seen people say the hard drive size. It just seems not many people elaborate on the processor and graphics card.\n\nI am taking Computer Animation. Thinking about getting an external GPU to help in rendering later in the degree program. I have 2 classes taken off for transferring credits. So I think my launchbox comes towards the end of my second class. I will need the MacBook Pro for my third class 3d Foundations.\n\n[edit with new info]\nI forgot to mention I\u2019m taking classes online. So I receive my Macbook later than someone on campus. I was told normally it\u2019s after your first 4 classes. I should get mine after my first 2 since I transferred in credits.\n\nThese are the stats I was given over chat:\n2017 MacBook Pro 15 inch\n2.8GHz quad-core 7th-generation Intel Core i7 processor, Turbo Boost up to 3.8GHz\n16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory\n512GB SSD storage\nRadeon Pro 555 with 2GB memory\n\nThe default stats with the hard drive bumped up from 256GB to 512GB.",

An external GPU should be enough until the program ends. \n\nI will just keep putting money to the side and wait to see what Apple comes up with for the new Mac Pro next year. Supposedly they are making sure it\u2019s more modular and can be catered towards different job fields including Computer Animation. Only time will tell. ",

The MacBooks usually come with the i7 processor quad-core 8 gigs of RAM the first tier of dedicated graphics is usually what they pick. If they're not giving you an external GPU to use then you do not need it for the program. I am a Show Pro major however I did know many other computer animation majors.",

They are going for around 1800 or more on eBay. The lower price is to be expected since the 2018 MacBookPro just recently came out. I don\u2019t know what program you are in but mine came with Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro X.  Just those 2 pieces of software that came with the MacBook Pro add an extra $500. Final Cut Pro is $299.99 and Logic Pro X is $199.99.  Although I was mad that they did not send the 2018 MacBook Pro. This MacBook Pro is a lot better than the hp laptops that most other schools send you.\n\n",

The older models 2015 and before where an easy fix with firmware locks. Usually you can only go to the Apple store when it comes to the 2017 model. When they go there they definitely ask about the original receipt of purchase.\n\nI got over wanting the 2018 MBP because for Computer Animation there is no real need for 6 cores or ddr4 ram when making 3d models.  So far no issues with my keyboard. Then again I don\u2019t eat around mine. I have a few friends that have them and they haven\u2019t had any keyboard issues. The only thing I wouldn\u2019t trust a MacBook to do is serious 3d rendering. Then again no sane person would expect one to. Not even the 2018 model would be great for any kind of serious rendering. Which is why the school provides rendering farms because even they realize that. \n\nEven though I strictly only buy Apple products and have for years. I understand that the MacBook Pro is leagues behind other computers when it comes to 3d work.  Unless Apple pulls through hopefully next year. They are remaking the Mac Pro and making it into a modular system that we should be able to customize. They even called in people doing film and 3d work to help with testing. Just keeping my fingers crossed. \n\nWhen it comes to serious 3d work and even gaming Apple is just left in the dust and has been for years. I plan to build a desktop for rendering later when needed for actual work. Maybe one day Apple will start using Nvidia cards instead of sticking with AMD and alienating itself.",

            "comment": "Howdy! I\u2019m graduating from this program in October. It is a ton of knowledge. I don\u2019t remember what I expected going in, but it wasn\u2019t this. And I mean that in a good way. You\u2019ll learn the entire film production process from start to finish. Just have patience, it takes about six to eight months to really get into the nitty gritty of the program. \n\nSome of the teachers aren\u2019t that good, but don\u2019t be discouraged by them, because some of the teacher are excellent. You should have Randy Baker around month 9. He\u2019s an expert with a camera. You\u2019ll have Tommy Dennis around month 21ish and again a few months later. He won\u2019t stop talking about his experience directing and acting, and he love sharing that knowledge with you. \n\nThose are just two among a bunch of great teachers. And a lot of them are adamant about you staying in touch, and you should, so at the end of your degree you\u2019ll have a nice network of filmmakers to tap into. \n\nAs was already mentioned, it\u2019s a lot of work, and it can be overwhelming sometimes, especially if you\u2019re working full-time, but if you keep on schedule, do all of the tasks, and maintain an open dialogue with your teachers, it\u2019s not too difficult. \n\nMost of all, just breathe. And congratulations. Welcome to Full Sail, friend. My DMs are open if you ever need anything.",

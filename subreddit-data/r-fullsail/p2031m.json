    "postText": "Yesterday, I posted a picture of my conditional acceptance to full sail. I was excited about this for the obvious reasons but also because I am a convicted felon on probation and this seemed like my first step back into a fruitful life. Today I called to make sure they had received my FAFSA and to check what else I had to do. When I did the person who they connected me with asked if I had checked my email today, I said I had but didn\u2019t see anything from them. He then informed me that due to my situation, I would not be accepted. This is especially frustrating because I wasn\u2019t even going on campus, I was going online. \n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder what would have happened if I had just lied and said I didn\u2019t have a record. I have been told that being honest and vulnerable about my situation would help me in most situations, I guess not. \n\nLet me be clear, I\u2019m not saying that they should necessarily accept anyone for anything but I filled out the prior offense form (POF) and told them I was on probation and was then forced to pay for a background check. I called and spoke to two separate individuals and they both ensured me that if I had filled out the POF, and they had still sent the background check that they were doing so as a procedural thing and would almost certainly be accepted. \n\nI\u2019m beyond frustrated because I didn\u2019t really have that money, and it overall just adds to the setbacks I have faced.",

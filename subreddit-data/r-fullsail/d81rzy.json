    "postText": "Hello! I am currently a senior in high school and have been wanting to major in Game Art and/or Game Design for a while now. The state that I live in (AL) does not have any kind of university or community college that carries majors in these categories. And while I *have* seen minors, there isn't anything that I would rather take and waste money on to take it as just a minor. I would rather devote all of my time and money into something I'm interested or devoted to.\n\nI have seen a lot of comments and reviews about Full Sail (and how 'awful' it is) and I'm not interested in hearing about those things. I've done my research on both those topics and scoured the official website for any information that I am able to find on my own without contacting Admissions just yet. So please, don't tell me how awful it is. I would prefer if anyone who replies to this has good information that I can put to use while choosing between Game Art/Design. \n\nThere are a few things I'm a little confused on (and correct me on some things if I'm wrong) about the online courses and the degrees that go with them (as well as some other stuff that will be down below the important things). The website is fairly vague and while I am prepared to go to admissions for these questions, I would like some input from people who have attended or are attending the online courses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the sake of answering my questions, I will be using the idea that I will be attending for the Game Art bachelor's degree online course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Important Questions:***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Are classes (online) difficult to keep up with? If so, why? I'd also be pleased if you could add some examples to further my understanding of it.**\n\n*In terms of 'keeping up', I mean the weekly workload of assignments. Ergo: How many assignments may be given during a week for that month of coursework? And how much time should it take to complete those?*\n\n**2. How difficult are the classes to someone with no experience, granted that I attend online? Are the teachers particularly helpful (sometimes I may be a little dense on some topics)?** \n\n3. **How long should the Game Art bachelor's degree take me to complete? Is it the standard four years, like normal colleges, or due to the fast pace, two years? There were some inconsistencies on this and I'd like a solid answer.**\n\n4. **If prepared to go into the classes aware of the time needed to dedicate to this degree, how much free time would I have (given that I attend my classes and do my assignments on a strict time crunch that I give myself) for things like doctor's appointments and sicknesses (if they are severe enough that I cannot function at the time)?**\n\n5. **I do not intend to attend Full Sail until next fall. For scholarships, what are some key times before the term begins that I should submit them (if I am applicable) and the admissions form as well? (Advice on which scholarships to apply for would be helpful.)**\n\n6.  **Finally, the Project Launchbox. If I am attending online, how early should I apply to get the required equipment on time so that I can attend classes as they begin?** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\"Kind of stupid\" Questions:***\n\nI may be missing some things or just reading over an important piece of information, but there are some things I just don't understand or get about the coursework. \n\n1. *What kind of math is involved? I would like to know so that I can attend some classes ahead of time before the semester starts.*\n2. *What kind of programs do people attending the Game Art course use? Are they things I can take a look at and get a good understanding on before I begin attending?* \n3. *Last one, I think. Are the classes given through a webcam, or is it something like ACCESS, where you get the coursework and study for it yourself without any intervention from the teacher, and have a select time and date to submit it? (I didn't see anything detailing this information when I looked on the website).*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will ask these questions to admissions, when I decide to enroll, but for now, I think Reddit will do. Please be nice and/or honest to the point of bluntness, but don't be mean or rude; my school doesn't offer much in the way of help to apply to colleges except for going through FAFSA applications, and the counselor isn't available the majority of the time, so any answers to just one question or all of them would be appreciated. Thank you, and have a nice day or night!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \\*\\*If the formatting is messed up, I'm sorry, I've never used reddit before except to read AITA posts.",

            "comment": "Game art grad here. Now workin triple A games as a character artist.\n\n1)they are difficult to keep up with, you may have 10 plus parts to a project to complete per week and it could take 4-5 hours per piece to complete. In short it is a full time job and you wont have much time if any for a social life. Most of my time was 12+ hour days between classes, working on classes, and making work/ researching and watching tutorials outside the curriculum.\n\n2) i went in with 0 experience and got hired a week after grad. Its totally doable, if you treat it like a job to learn these skills.\n\n1) the acxelerated track is 2 years, the standard track is much longer maybe 3 years because you wont take as many classes at the same time\n\n2) you will have plenty of time to do life stuff like appointments etc but you will not have enough time to play games for 2 hours a day and go out with friends on a regular basis. The first few months are pretty easy and you will have plenty of time, but as you progree thing become very time and labor intensive.\n\n3) classes start every month, you can start whatever month you want, apply for stuff whenever you want, theres a portal for all of this stuff when you apply. Try to get all the scholarships, some require a short essay but its very easy to get.\n\n4) admissions will get you your gear well before you start.\n\nStupid questions\n\n1) math for game art is very basic algebra, math for game design is MUCH more difficult. Make sure you really want whichever degree you choose. Game art is for artists, game design is basically coding with some gameplay elements thrown in. You make 3d models in game art, and you make systems and code in game design.\n\n2) game art uses Maya, zbrush, substance painter, and unreal engine 4. You can get student versions or trials for most of these and i implore you to watch tutorials on the basics before you get to class. \n\n3) some classes are webcam, some are just audio with a screen share, some are videos you watch, some are text based but not many. You get the work at the beginning of the week and have to submit by the end of the week *usually*.\n\nI think thats it, if you have more questions or need clarification then feel free to pm me \ud83d\udc4c",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nThis may be my third time looking into Full Sail again for my Master's degree. Maybe it's a sign to finally apply and give it a go. I was wonder how their Master's degree online programs are. Would it work out with credit wise since I went to a different college for my BS? I also want to know if I would be able to look into getting a phD with FSU grad credits? \n\nHow was your experience there? (Those that have graduated or currently in a program) Is it worth it? Did you learn a lot or gain the knowledge/tools that you needed?",

            "comment": "Your credits aren't traditionally credited meaning they can't be transferred to other schools. Full Sail is a for profit school they mostly want your money. Other schools have better programs and their classes on networking and marketing aren't worth it. The tech package might also seem nice but you'd save money buying the gear yourself. \nYou'd have a better time just getting a job and learning as you go",

I have been seeking out the students that do the best work during discussion assignments and have been making myself known to my instructors.  Truth be told, becoming friends with others is not going to give you a career in your chosen field.  Learn what you can.  Be the best that you can be.  People aren\u2019t hiring people based upon what \u201cnew guy\u201d your friends with.  Networking is important and do it as much as you can.  But, focus on learning everything that you can to your best ability. Skill is what sets us aside.  Be skillful",

I started to get tired of waiting around, checking the website and finding out they were gonna be shut down for another month. So I eventually stopped checking and gave up on trying to move down there for in person classes. Currently in my 11th month online, was only supposed to do 2 online though lol it is what it is I guess.",

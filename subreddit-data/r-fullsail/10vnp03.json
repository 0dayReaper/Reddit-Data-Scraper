    "postText": "I went to another school for animation for 3.5 years. They pulled some funny stuff in regards to finacials, so only completed about 64 credits, 20 off from graduation. Then i found Fullsails Online Animation program. I hadnt been long out of school then, so i enrolled there, currently in my 3rd month.(Quite enjoying the experience so far, though ive been a traditional student for most of my tenure, online is okay.) Im familiar with my field already, and unfortunately, ive taken the classes already that im taking now(Because previous school wont release my official transcript unless i pay 4k). My counselor knew the situation but said itd be fine to enroll (kinda odd, but screw it) I just want the piece of paper that begins my legitimacy in the industry i guess. Long story short, i signed up for the Associates of computer animation program, because with the Bachelors, i think my Pell grant wouldve run out or something, because of my prev school attendance. Now my worry, is, jobs. Now i plan to continue on to get the bachelors since its so fast. But even after the associates program is done, im not seeing any prospects for employment. Mind you, im realistic. An associates degree isn\u2019t much in this field, but does anyone know what you CAN do with that. Ive looked into things like web design positions, Internships, etc etc. Ideally im thinking, if i have some sort of entry job, knowing it may just be the intern, or the light guy, i dunno. Then i could be working with experience while getting the bachelors and THEN shop to different places. As of now, i have a portfolio, but just for illustration and digital painting stuff, no true animation or 3d there (YET i can do 3d work too). I think, i just need some outside perspective, maybe something a bit hopeful? as ive been gauging everything in my head and, im not sure what itll amount to.",

Someone will hire you.\n\nFwiw, I was hired at a AAA studio half way through my degree program.",

I was getting very frustrated googling,\u201dCareer fields able to enter with a AA in Computer Animation\u201d. Ill start with that and something similar, im not one for complaining without working, the issue was ive gotten all this work done, and it seems like it\u2019s just, sitting there. Commissions cant be my end all be all. Much appreciated.",

You\u2019re going to have to apply a lot. And get rejected a lot. But hit every animation firm, every game studio. Just keep working it. There\u2019s not a ton of junior animator roles right now, so it\u2019s extra important your demo reel looks fantastic. (Even when played back at 2x-4x speed)",

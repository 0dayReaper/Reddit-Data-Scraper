    "postText": "Okay so i'm thinking about going to Full Sail for game design but I noticed they changed it from Game Design Bachelor to Interactive Technology with GD concentration and you need an associates degree/\n\nFirst off, did they replace the entire GD degree with the Interactive Technology one or am I still able to apply for GD. If it was replaced with Interactive Tech, why? That's just so much harder than what they had before. \n\nThird (mostly for current/past GD students), since I would need an associates degree to get into the GD concentration degree, should I start with game development and then switch?",

            "comment": "You don't need an associates prior. \n\nIt's a two part program. First half is the Game Development Associates, and the later half is the Information Technology Bachelors with a Concentration in Game Design.\n\nIt's kind of like how the Cybersecurity Bachelors works as of right now: First half is the Information Technology Associates and the latter half is the Cybersecurity Completion which nets you the Bachelors.\n\nIt did replace the original Game Design Program.\n\nAs far as content, I can't really speak to that but it seems to offer a more diverse take on tech than the original Game Design Bachelors did. I'll defer to others that are currently in the program on that.",

                    "comment": "The new degree absolutely does not (yet?) include associate level classes, they were all removed from the game design program. In fact, there\u2019s a sub-note on the page listing the classes that says they aren\u2019t allowing anyone to enroll without meeting the associates level prerequisites that don\u2019t exist anymore. IOW, only people who completed those classes previously or have transferring credits that cover those areas can enroll in the new program.\n\nFor those who aren\u2019t tracking this stuff, the classes that were removed and no longer available were all part of an ACCSC complaint over graduation rates and accreditation. The school likely removed them in response and renamed the bachelor program - just an assumption since the school has yet to provide an official response to this in the past year.\n\nWith regards to the classes still available, they are nearly all the same ones from the game design bachelors program except they renamed the project and portfolio classes - all of which were mostly pointless classes anyway.\n\nTo be clear, in the new program you need all core classes plus classes from ONE concentration group in addition to prerequisite credit hours not listed because they were removed.",

            "comment": "First off, yes. Game Design has had a name and course change. That long name is what it is now. From what I've been told and researched, FS has had an issue with low graduation percentages (people actually making it through and earning a degree) and graduates actually getting hired (mostly because FS doesn't adequately prepare you for Game Design). Back when I went through, which wasn't super long ago, people in the associates part of the Bachelors could barely read, let alone write properly. The majority of my fellow students couldn't even follow simple directions... and i mean simple instructions that an elementary school kid should be able to comprehend. So, from what I'm hearing, instead of adequately preparing people, they decided to say, \"Hey, no, you prepare yourself, and then try again. We will not waste our time actually teaching.  What, do you think we are, an institution of learning or something!?\" I hope they improved the rest of the course, but FS seems more focused on churning out fodder for companies like EA to crunch and then throw out instead of making competent and self-sufficient game designers But who knows, this course may have changed in the right direction. Are you willing to bet tens of thousands of dollars and several years of your life?",

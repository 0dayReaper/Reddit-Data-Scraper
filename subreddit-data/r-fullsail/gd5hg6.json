    "postText": "So I emailed tech support to see what the exact specs for the z book 17 g6 would be, and they responded and told me that it has a quad core i7 in it and a Quadro p5000, which didn't sound right to me since HP says the g6 has the rtx quadros. Would anybody currently in the program be able to confirm or deny what they told me?",

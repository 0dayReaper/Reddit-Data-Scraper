    "postText": "Does anyone have any information on whether or not Full Sail will be including the new 16\" MacBook Pro with the Launch Box instead of the older now replaced 15.4\" MacBook Pro? I will not be receiving the MacBook Pro until mid-late February so I would assume that they would be shipping the new models unless they bought them in bulk and ship from within their own inventory.\n\nI would assume since the Launch Box is stated to consist of the most up to date technology within the industry that we are studying that they would make the switch to the better hardware but I can't be 100% sure.  If you have any insight feel free to let me know!",

And looking through this sub reddit when I was about to recieve mine, they only started shipping the 2018 models Feb 2019. And I would guess that full sail will buy as many of the previous models as they can before they\u2019re no longer available.",

But I think I posted in this Subreddit before different specs I found. Surely that link I was sent is out of date.",

For the sake of not blowing this out of proportion, I'm going to keep details under wraps for safety reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi! The wife(30) and I (27M) were hoping to meet some friendly people to socialize with at the party. This Reddit account is for our shared business, so you won't find a lot about us other than the fact that we play Animal Crossing New Horizons. Assuming there is *ANY* interest at all, I will be more than happy to chat and plan via DM!",

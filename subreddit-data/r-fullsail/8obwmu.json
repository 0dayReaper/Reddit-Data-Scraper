You're doing 2 classes a month, which are usually a 2-day and a 3-day class, though sometimes you get 2x 3. So 5-6 days a week, IIRC. Though scheduling may have changed a bit since I went through a few years ago.\n\nYou do not have time for a full-time position while going through school on-campus.\n\nYou can also do a non-accelerated program which I think is just 1 class a month, so half what I mentioned.\n\nI spent some time doing the federal student work study program on campus as well, which is part-time.\n\nMostly I lived off my GI bill and some minimal student loans with some assistance from my wife and VA disability.",

I saw there was not much activity on this thread and was worried no one would get back to me!\n\nAlso was the course load overwhelming or did each class give you a pretty good understanding as to what to expect skills wise in the next class?",

So you have nothing to pay out of pocket. This covers books, your personal laptop, software, etc.\n\nAs for the classes being overwhelming, as long as you follow along, do the assigned reading and assignments, it should be smooth sailing. I did a different degree, so I can't speak to many specifics for what you'll be doing, though.",

Overall I have and will continue to recommend it as a school for people looking to get into the gaming and entertainment industries, ESPECIALLY on GI Bill.",

(using my GI bill, 40+ hour work week, husband and a father of one) It\u2019s important to remember that you have a family who will be supportive of your decision. There will be times where trying to maintain a work life, a social life, a family life, and school life (lots of different lives I know) But something that I\u2019ve had to do is sometimes when the things are starting to seem tough just back away and take a break spend time with your family or go outside. They teach you about workflow and what you can do to come up with your own to minimize stress. There will be late nights and cram sessions, but nothing is compared to having that diploma in your hand. Stay strong keep your family in the loop and continue mission.",

The online format definitely allows you to be flexible with your time but if you don\u2019t work on something each day then you\u2019ll need to work twice as hard the next day to keep on top of everything. It\u2019s doable, it\u2019s fun, and it\u2019s interesting. So if you really want to dive into the career then just take it as seriously as possible and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do just fine. ",

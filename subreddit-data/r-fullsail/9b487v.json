So I graduated last year. My roomate did the associate's in the online program and finished a few months ago. The courses are pretty similar but the online was a lot more DIY independant style. \n\nAs for the writing aspect, it's definitely less writing than a typical school. The hard part for me was there was so much to do in a short span. The assignments branch off of eachother too so if your a procrastinator (like me) it gets messy quick. If your on top of things it's really not too hard. \n\n",

I'll be honest, it's much more difficult to find jobs in film. It is possible ofcourse, but about 1/5th of my film class of 40 are working in the industry right now (they graduated 2016) and 10 out of 14 people in my show production class are working in the industry (graduated Sept of 2017). I mostly think that has a lot to do with attitude. The first few months you'll find a lot of people take film because they think its an easy career choice. It is not... Also almost everyone wants to be a director, which you may already know, is not an entry level position. So they focus on that the whole time and at the ebd wonder why they don't have the skills to be a camera PA. Full Sail is the kind of school where you get out of it what you put into it. ",

Which is perfect for me because I plan on milking every ounce of the school. But It baffles me why/how people would think film is an easy career choice.

Lol\n\nAnyway, when you get there volenteer every chance you get! As soon as you get access to the connect portal look up 'Student Event Crew.' That is the student run crew that man's all the productions the the on campus venue. It's an amazing place to learn about live production but also you'll learn so much about video, audio and lighting. It's all stuff that will benefit you in the industry. Something you can do now is join [The Crew](https://m.facebook.com/groups/285989104877184?group_view_referrer=unknown) on faceboom. That is an online Club that is run by a Full Sail instructor. She posts job leads and connects graduates with other industry professionals around the country. It has really become like a full blow network that she has created. ",

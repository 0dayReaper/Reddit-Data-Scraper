Battles have left some settlements in ruins. Others teem with refugees. Even away from the fighting, towns and villages suffer from having their fighting-age citizens lured away or conscripted by one faction or the other. Players control their armies and try to wipe out their opponents! Use terrain, abilities and pure cowardice if need be to achieve victory for your faction!",

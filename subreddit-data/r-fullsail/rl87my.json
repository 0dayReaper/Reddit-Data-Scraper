The videos I found were uploaded in 2020 so it seems Full Sail is purchasing equipment on an as-needed basis to stay up to date with current tech. Don't go Full Sail unless you know how to grind, the credits from your degree won't transfer to most traditional colleges because this is a for-profit institution. Go here strictly because it will provide you with suitable education and connections to further your career. A lot of folks fall for the free laptop, $5000 camera if your doing the cinematographer course like I am, and understand how much the odds are against you once you go to a for-profit school. You gotta hustle, just after you graduate your gonna hustle with some really profound knowledge.\n\np.s you did a great job by not choosing DeVry.",

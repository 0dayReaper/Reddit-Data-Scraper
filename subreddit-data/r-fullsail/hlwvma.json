I\u2019m half way in it and based from my experience I would tell you to watch all the lectures, take notes and practice, practice! Classes only get harder as you progress and if you do not put in your whole effort you will not learn much. Do side projects. Manage your time and use discord to your advantage. Always read everything.",

Full sail knows exactly what they\u2019re doing, praying on passionate kids to get degrees that aren\u2019t necessary to outside the industry you desire.",

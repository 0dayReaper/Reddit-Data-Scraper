    "postText": "So I attended a technical college a few years ago and earned my Associates degree in 3D modeling and animation. I've decided to go back to school to get my Bachelors and thought FSU seemed like a great option for online learning. Only thing is I can't draw at all. I'm used to scribbling out stuff that are basically stick figure type art and I learned that you actually have to do a portfolio submission of 5 artworks. Thoa is scaring me very bad because I've completed everything else but this. I'm currently trying to learn how to draw worth something so that I can submit some SL sketches since those seemed to be the easiest choice to choose from but I was hoping I could get an idea on what kind of submission art they might be looking for. I feel like of I see what kind of submissions are sent in and accepted, it might help me to know what kind of work I need to practice on learning before my deadline comes up. I have about three weeks to get some quality work done and I'm just now learning how to do circles and a little shading. I've always wanted to learn to draw but took no time to do so before amd now I wish I had actually taken lessons or something. \n\nI have a few questions as well:\n\n1. Is it worth it to go to Full Sail? \n2. Is it hard to get into? \n3. Is it tough to keep up with once enrolled?\n4. Do the teachers care a out you once you are enrolled and in class?\n5. What is the success rate of graduates finding work after graduation?\n6. Are the computer animation courses actually good?\n7. How hard are the computer animation classes?\n\nAny of this information would be great to know before I fully commit to join or pay anything. I dint have scholarships but the momentum one they possibly provide and the fafsa aid provided to cover most of the costs. I want to be sure this is a good school to commit to. I've been reading a lot of recent and old posts and I feel like they are giving me cold feet with their reviews and thoughts on their experience attending. I work a full time job but want something better for myself where I feel I am properly compensated for my hard work and switching fields is what I feel like is probably necessary, but a good school to teach you what is needed is really important too. Any information and advice you all have would be greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "1. **Is it worth**: Ugh, I hate being the guy that says it, but you'll get back what you put into it haha. In the past year I've been seeing progressively better results from student work, the curriculum has improved a lot. If you have the drive and are willing to go the extra mile instead of the bare minimum, it will absolutely be worth your while.\n2. **Is it hard to get into**: No. They'll accept anyone with a high school degree/GED &amp; the means to afford tuition. This school is not like Ringling/Gnomon/CalArts, you don't need a portfolio to apply. My drawing skills were abysmal.\n3. **Is it tough to keep up:** Yes. Sometimes. If you're doing the courses online, you'll have one per month (occasionally two, but it's rare). Online students tend to have an easier time juggling part time work and school work. Campus students not so much, unfortunately.\n4. **Do teachers care:** Of course. The wide majority of instructors I had were invested in our success and seemed to genuinely care. Sure, there were a couple 'less than pleasant' instructors, but that'll be in every college unfortunately.. At the end of the day, realize that each class is just one month long. The instructors sometimes may seem like they're going through the motions, but it's because they're constantly teaching the same thing and re-starting 30 days later lol. It gets updated of course, but the core teachings are still the same.\n5. **What is the success/employment rate**: They report on the employment rate annually, but it's meaningless IMO. It doesn't account for the folks that just went back home to work at Costco-- that's employment, so +%. I will be as blunt as possible: It's low. On the flip side, this is not unique to Full Sail. Many students from animation/art schools have a devastatingly difficult time breaking into the industry. You didn't miss the ship, but the industry as a whole is \"exhaling\" right now and experiencing tons of layoffs after the COVID-boom demand for animation on streaming platforms. As a result, the mid-senior folks losing their jobs are getting swept up by other studios, leaving nothing for entry-level artists. That's just how the industry goes, unfortunately. It will get better.\n6. **Are the animation courses actually good:** I'd say so, but I'm a bit biased because animation was my chosen focus. Animation in general is a very sink-or-swim discipline. Many folks that started the program thinking they wanted to be animators ended up switching their focus to something like environment art or rigging. I actually started thinking I was gonna be a character modeler, but fell in love w/ animating. The animation instructors are mostly all Disney veterans from the old studio that closed down in FL.\n7. **How hard are the computer animation classes:** Are we talking strictly animation? The reason I ask is because the degree program is designed to allow you to experience every part of a 3D production pipeline to get a feel for what you like. There's only a couple of animation classes unless you decide to make it your focus/discipline. The first few classes are solid at establishing the principles of animation, I'd say they were pretty good. Definitely requires a lot of studying on your own time.",

                    "comment": "Thank you so much for the detailed response and advice, I definitely appreciate it. I'm definitely going to give it my all as I really especially t a career in this. I'm not sure if it will specifically be for the animation portion as I do love attempting to design and create characters and would love to create environments as well. I also had an interest in animation itself and rigging, so I guess the more I learn, the easier it will help decide what is right for me. \n\nI think it may be a little hard keeping up for me as I do have a full-time job, so I work a lot, and my work days are long but I have worked a full-time job and completed my Associates degree so I will try to push through it. \n\nThank you again for your response, it definitely gave me better insight and helped me.",

            "comment": "Hey there, I just started classes and had a similar issue with the portfolio. I had plenty of 3d art I had done but zero traditional art. I could barely draw a stick person let alone a cube. I went out bought a sketch book and some pencils and just started practicing. Fullsail has a workshop online that helped a lot but you can find stuff online and on YouTube. Took me 2 weeks with work to learn the basics and submit the portfolio. My stuff is far from good but they did accept it, I did however also attach my 3d art as well so that may have helped. If you want to see what I sent them PM me and I'll send you over what I submitted as an example of what passed",

I did buy a sketchbook and have been trying to read through Betsy Edward's book and Mark Kidtlers' book that my younger brother loaned me. It's hard to get practice during my work week, but I'm about to power through some lessons and practice on my off days this weekend. I would love to see what you submitted as an example of what passed. It'll help me determine what kind of level of art I need to be at to submit my portfolio. I really appreciate your offering to help me in that way. Thank you so much.",

(I just graduated the graphic design program and am going straight into animation and had to submit the portfolio too) They\u2019re not going to kick you for it when they know you\u2019ve got $34k+ ready to hand them . \n\nI know a few solid animators that can\u2019t draw on paper to save their lives. With technology these days, the requirement of drawing is less.",

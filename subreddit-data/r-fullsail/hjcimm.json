The whole \u201cwe get it done quickly to save you money\u201d is criminal.  My ex went to film school and worked as she went for four years and paid off all of her tuition as she went. I went to fill sail in 12 months and borrowed the money and owe $57k is the initial $90k I borrowed in 2007!  $657 a month I pay. I earn nearly $175k a year at 34 year old and omg, I havent been able to have a savings account still.  Full sail is a scam.  Feel free to PM me if you have questions. \n\nThe only people that disagree with that sentiment are current or recently graduated students because they\u2019re not 4 years graduated and jobless. Please trust me and quit while you\u2019re ahead",

            "comment": "Maybe. It depends on how long  you are gone for. This is because the coursework changes. There's no guarantee they will take you again as well, and you may end up with all that debt with no degree. If you can finish and then do the other, you should weigh the opportunity cost against the possibility that you may not be able to come back.  \nIt's a possibility. I couldn't. I was hit by a car on semoran and university while on a bike. I needed therapy to move my arm. They didn't like that, and let me go. Couldn't go back if I wanted to because I have to tell them how I'm a better person who won't quit this time. (Real dick maneuver if you ask me).",

I have a 3.9 GPA (which is incredible since I usually hate school) in my Graphic Design degree, but I lost the motivation and took a couple months off to get that back. I'm just not sure it's the right career field for me, and I'm almost done with my second month off, and I'm still lost about what to do.",

            "comment": "For sure, but it depends on many factors, and more importantly, the metric by which you measure your success \n\nI graduated Valedictorian of my Recording Arts class. I originally wanted to work as a music producer with my own studio, but FS really opened my eyes to the wide range of work options with the skillsets I picked up while there, and it made me realize that there\u2019s a million different paths I could take and that the one that brought me there in the first place wasn\u2019t really for me. \n\nI currently work in a video production company, and while I did audio work exclusively for a little bit, I have become a swiss army knife of video work and now act as the head of the camera department, am one of the most pro efficient editors/colorists/sound mixers we have. Been working here for 4 years and I still have much to learn and grow, but I already feel like a very successful creative in both skillset and portfolio.\n\nI attribute a big portion of that to my time in FS, mostly because of the people I got to meet there. I hung out with film students consistently, and a lot of my friends are consistently working on big name productions making a really good living out of it. It\u2019s not for everyone, but FS was definitely a formative experience that made them graduate with a solid grasp of how to get into the industry and work their way up the ladder faster than most.\n\nAll that being said, it didn\u2019t just happen to them. At FS you really only get what you put in. People with enthusiasm and solid work ethic get compensated by virtue of getting more hands on experience, but coasting thru will get you very little in the way of applicable, real world skills. Your title will probably mean very little for most of the industries FS caters towards, having said that I\u2019ve only heard good things about FS graduates from many veterans in the industry who didn\u2019t go there and it always has to do with their profile and work ethic as well as how ready they are when it comes to coming into the industry.\n\nThe truth is, the bar to graduate and get ur title at FS is abysmally low. You can get thru with minimal effort, and passing your clases really just requires you to be there and pay attention sometimes. This is for my program, of course, and I\u2019m sure others like computer science and graphics might be different, but in general FS is not a **hard** school. The real value here is in **access**, to state of the art facilities, gear, and teachers (results may vary, but there are some badass people teaching here if you care to find them).\n\nI consider myself successful but I also know I\u2019m not even close to where I want to get, I think staying hungry is essential to making it any industry and FS is a place that can reward you if you have that mentality and follow thru with it. I also went to school with many people that are probably not doing much with what they learned there, but it\u2019s invariably the ones that were always dicking off in class, doing the bare minimum, and basically wasting their time for a place that doesn\u2019t really care about you if you don\u2019t care to put in any of that effort.\n\nFor me it was an amazing experience that I will always remember fondly as part of the solid foundation it helped me build before going into my professional &amp; all around creative life. Again, not for everyone, but if it is for you then you will most definitely get something valuable out of it!",

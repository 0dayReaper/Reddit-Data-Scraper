            "comment": "Work Study- not really, and holding a job while enrolled is hard, but doable. There are campus jobs for students, most people work off campus to my knowledge. \n\nInternships- Yes and no, this one is on you. You can get internships, due to how full sail\u2019s classes work, you\u2019ll basically end up effectively taking a pause, doing the internship (Full Saul puts you into a special class or state for this) then you come back and join whatever cohort is in the class you left off at. \n\nRent- sorry. No idea anymore. Lots of good sites out there to check out rental costs though. \n\nNo Dorms. \n\nFull Sail does do job fairs. I\u2019ve only attend one as an employer, but they seemed pretty great. \n\nJob Security - Same anywhere in tech right now. You\u2019re job safety is most tied to the financial health and funding of the company you join. It\u2019s not something I personally worry about in tech, once you\u2019re established and have 2+ years, you\u2019ll find another job.",

With just the first 13 months I can tell you , that you can get a programming job almost anywhere and you'll be just fine to pass all the technical interviews. No internships , there is a work study I believe.. I worked three part time jobs off campus near by while I went to Full Sail full time. Tons and tons of part time jobs available near campus. Especially when UCF lets out for summer. Rent is very expensive. My last year in Orlando ( 2021 )  I was paying 1,800 for a 2/2 right beside Full sail.. However in 2017 in downtown I was only paying $930 for  a 2/2 . Really depends how far away from Full Sail your willing to stay / commute.",

Having class 9am - 5pm so you\u2019d have to add two additional hours on there for commuting on top of juggling class work and having multiple classes . There was also an instance where we had a 5pm - 1 am class and then immediately had a 9am - 3 pm class just 8 hours later. Might be worth discussing the logistics with your advisor after you enroll on maybe being able to spread out classes liek that over multiple months .",

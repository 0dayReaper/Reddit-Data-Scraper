Each class is a month, but again, the first four are basics to pretty much weed out students before they send your equipment (laptop, tablet, programs, etc.). I was able to do a weeks worth of work in a night for 16 weeks. Then you get your stuff! Huzzah!\n\nThen, it gets rough. Like, seriously, prepare your testes. Work load increases from a couple hours one night a week into AT LEAST a couple a night. I generally do a couple hours a night and do school work almost all Saturdays to get Sunday off (M-F job). Expect even more than that sometimes with a couple of dual classes thrown in at about the year mark. Most live classes will be Monday or Tuesday evening (6-8pm is the usual times), but Full Sail is cool about missing them since they post up the recordings to view for people who can't attend. They're usually about an hour or two long. \n\nThe classes are very fun, though. Hard earlier on when learning the programs, but I have a sense of accomplishment with what I've learned in the year and a half I've done. \n\nFor reference, 95% of my grades are B. Put more time in for A's.\n\nTL;DR First few months is stupid easy, then be prepared to get kicked in the balls with time input. Put the work in, and it'll show, though. And it's totally fun. \n\nPS: You will more than likely have to move for a job, as most are in Cali, save up moving money.",

My portfolio has stuff from a lot of my classes, and you can blatantly see my progression (it was required to have an Artstation account about six months in or so, so it's from then until now).\n\nThe classes do have traditional art, 3D, 3D sculpting, and both 2D and 3D animation. The traditional art classes aren't hard, but Full Sail does want you to have a basic understand of proportion, anatomy, shading, and texture. But they they expect that you haven't drawn anything since you were a kid. I had some prior experience in art, like humans, but the animal anatomy tore me up. Again, nothing stupid hard. The 3D courses are all pretty easy at first, but the learning curve is steep if you don't do some self study as to how to use the programs. I'll give you a heads up and say start looking into Autodesk Maya, ZBrush, Unreal4, and Substance Painter.",

One thing to also consider ot internships, but those are still hard to get into, and Full Sail doesn't put up a lot of notifications for internships and job fairs.

It's gonna be pretty rough, but hopefully I'll figure it out. I guess.\n\nAnd yeah, literally every person is just like \"you get out what you put in\" which is totally not helpful. That applies to basically everything in life, honestly. I just worry it'll end up being too hard somehow, but it seems like as long as it's interesting it'll be fun so I'll actually enjoy doing the work rather than dreading it (I spent my freshman year of college at Pitt, *that* was a mistake.

Not going to lie, I Googled anything I needed to find out, and a lot of CGI forums and YouTube videos will teach you pretty well. Other students host Google Hangout sessions and are super helpful as well. It's how well you can search Google and get in touch with people sometimes, haha.\n\nThe school is definitely expensive, though. I think my total tuition is close to $70k or something, and that's with their scholarship as well. Their scholarship is nice, it covers $20k total after you maxed out loans. For example, a theoretical semester costs $7k or so. My loans cover $5.5k (I don't get Pell due to the fact that my wife and I have a combined income above Pell-worthy), Full Sail covers that $2.5k. I then still have $17.5k to dip into when I max out loans again. You just have to stay in the same degree major to keep the scholarship. Switch majors, and they drop that scholarship. That scholarship is the only way I can afford to go on top of maxing out loans.\n\nEdit: If you do start the Game Art degree, feel free to message me, or get in contact. I'd be willing to teach some stuff, especially if I'm currently doing school work, haha. \n\nAnd a lot of expense is the equipment and programs. The Macbook is about $3k (high end 2015 model, from what I got), and thousands of dollars worth of programs used by professionals.",

            "comment": "Great question. I did DAD on-campus but I think the rule of thumb is still the same, since the maxim of \"you get out what you put in\" definitely still applies.\n\nIf you're doing accelerated (21mo BS or half length for Assoc.) then at minimum you're looking at 40 hours a week. should break down to 20 hours of instruction and 20 hours of lab time, four of each eight hours a day. Non-accelerated brings you down for 20 hours a week, 10 of each.\n\nNon-accelerated was not an option when I started, and nobody wanted to give me a job when I said my schedule changed about every 30 days.\n\n\nNow don't get me wrong I still had time to socialize and have a personal life, but I definitely didn't get the same benefit as the students who doubled down on the work. I could've accomplished the same thing, and more, if I had done something like worked out a 1 day/week internship somewhere.\n\nI realize the above is not easy in a niche like GA, so alternate to finding an internship in games, I'd suggest instead to try and find something that could pay a little money, and keep you drawing/creating since that's going to be the focal point of at least the first 9-12 months on the accelerated program.\n\nOh- On campus goes to a zoo (maybe. maybe not. You'll see) in the first couple months for an animal drawing project. I recommend this if you've never done it- go to the zoo and draw some animals.\n\nI tried GA and ended up in DAD because lack of being a lifetime artist presented too large a challenge for me to continue.",

Just took a look and it's mostly greek to me at this point, but it looks like they don't do what I described anymore (offer a more drawn out program) but still ask your enrollment advisor about whether or not they still offer it as an option. \n\nNow again I don't recall clearly what we did for split months but I believe months where you have two classes the're 20 hour/week classes and the single class months are still 40 hour classes. Again I don't know specifically for sure anymore and you should ask someone in enrollment specifically. If they can't answer ask to speak with someone in the department that handles your course.\n\n/u/Hocata makes some excellent points.\n\nAll my tale of caution is, I did my degree on campus, and still tried to do the social life thing, and date, and honestly it's been an uphill walk, in the mud, in driving rain, working towards employment that will enable me to start a family and live the life I want to live. I'm suffering *now* because I didn't *then*\n\nFull sail is not a joke. You can't apply the same mentality as regular college as you'd apply to this. If this is the mentality you have, stop. Consider what you want out of this experience, and re-evaluate. You can't take a lackadaisic position with this school because if you fuck around and don't get a good job you're going to drown in what you'll owe. \n\nIf you can swing it all go for it, but consider the pace this program will move at and consider if you can put some of what you want on hold for now for the benefit of your career and the rest of your life.",

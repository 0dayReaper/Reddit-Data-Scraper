If it's word of mouth, that's not very reliable.\n\n*That said,* there is a &lt; 50% graduation rate for all post-secondary schools universities and colleges. Even lower for Master's and Doctor's (Like, single digits low). Full Sail *has to* maintain a certain graduation rate, as all schools do, in order to maintain accreditation. Accreditation boards are constantly auditing *every school,* top to bottom, to make sure they meet certain guidelines.\n\nFull Sail has also been playing with a gimped deck. At many colleges and universities degrees progressive. X amount of credit hours under a certain discipline affords you an Associates, X amount more and you have a Bachelors, etc.\n\nSo, for instance, let's say you graduate high school and you don't know what you want to do. You either go to a community college and go for an Asssociates of Arts, or a Univesity and go for some kind of Bachelor's *path*. Either way, somewhere along the lines you'll likely collect enough credits to have an Associates. Then, if you drop out near the end for whatever reason, you don't earn your Bachelor's, but you *do* get an Associates.\n\nPreviously, at Full Sail you pick a degree, and you finish it. You stop half way? Nothing to show for it. Only recently they implemented Associates and Certificiates.",

Keep in mind full sail is a full time fast track university and allot of work needs to be done. many people drop out because the teachers are just so anal about class time its insane, If you work and have a hard time keeping up with the classes the best thing to do is drop out before student loans stack. I recently had family trouble and was going to miss a deadline and simply asked for an extension to which the teach accepted but not before making me feel like I'm not trying hard enough to keep up (when in reality I really am, I'm literally working over the road and doing classes when I pull over for the night at rest stops), Yes I asked the extension late but it was because of things I couldn't control. I honestly feel the school needs to do a better job at allowing online students to be more flexible with deadlines and not punish us just because we don't actually attend the classes on campus.",

    "postText": "Hello! My name is Mike, and I'm an engineer at Breadboard, a small startup company of 7 employees based here in Orlando. We're making a location-based strategy game called Terra Mango, and we're looking for people to join our closed beta. We set out to build a game that we really wanted to play, and we think a lot of people are going to love it.\n\nTerra Mango is a Location Based Strategy game, meaning it lets you build virtual towers where real buildings exist. It's got real-world exploration like Pok\u00e9mon Go, the persistent game play of an MMO, and the strategic planning of an RTS! You explore the world to collect resources, claim land, and coordinate attacks to conquer territory for your species.\n\nWe're actively looking for beta testers so sign up at https://terramango.com if you're interested to help test! Sign up as well if you want to get updates and sneak peeks.\n\nIf you want to go the extra mile, spread the word! We would really appreciate it.\n\nThere will also be a Kickstarter in the coming weeks, so keep an eye out for that!\n\nThanks for the support and hope to see you out on the battlefield!\nMike and the Breadboard Team",

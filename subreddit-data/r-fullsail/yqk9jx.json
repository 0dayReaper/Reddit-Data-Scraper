            "comment": "I'm an on-campus student. Which degree program are you in? In Computer Animation/Game Art there is *usually* a different instructor that manages the online students and does a pretty good job of supporting. That being said, things have been different since the pandemic.. I've noticed that a lot of the on-campus instructors have been forced to handle both online **and** campus students because they're short-staffed.. And that's a lot of students to manage &amp; grade assignments for. \n\nThe point still stands that you're not getting the support that you and your peers want, though, which is why I've asked which degree program you're in. Some degree programs have pretty active Discord channels where even the instructors and program directors are present.\n\nHave you e-mailed your instructor and asked for additional support?",

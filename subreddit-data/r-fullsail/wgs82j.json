    "postText": "Doesn't matter who you complain to. Took a pass/fail class did all the work to get the passing grade but because the teacher didn't like me she failed me. Throughout the month she singles me out and when I tried to participate in class discussion she made fun and belittled everything I had to say. Nobody at full sails office cared to believe me. It was her word against mine, and full sail doesn't make mistakes so the immature teachers they hire can't be bullies. Still paying loans for these classes and I wasn't even given a real chance. Full sail is a scam. And I want to contest my student loans paying all that money just to get alienated bullied out of my own education. Schools in America just seem a haven for bullies, i just wanna keep to myself and be treated fairly. But that will never happen in bully obsessed America. Infact I'm sure the comment section on this post will be full of lovely support. I'm just telling my real story, and wanting justice and fairness and not to pay for classes I had pulled out from under me, and never got a chance to take. But do what everybody in my life does when I complain about the unfair ways society and our institutions treat me, and personally attack me as if I'm the bad guy. Does anybody else in this country have empathy. Doesn't seem like it, can't wait to read all your personal attacks in the comments, because people would rather be evil and vile paying forward their hate to one another like that bully teacher who failed me for her own pleasures. I hope helping to ruin someone's already crap life gave her the 5 seconds of pleasure she was seeking. Oh and full sail continues to do nothing... Why do you fail your students after taking so much money from them??",

Take a step back find out what is wrong before blaming someone else. If you did all the work and on time with passing grades and can prove it, then you should be good even if you and the teacher do not get along.",

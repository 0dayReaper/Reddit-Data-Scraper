    "postText": "Hello Fullsail reddit community. I am looking for talented freelance MGFX artists for paid work. I work for a small production company and we want to build our network of artists. I figured full sail would be a good place to look.\n\nI realize there is not many of you here, but maybe you also would know a more appropriate way to search. We have contacted the University directly before, however they didn't give us so many great options. So i figured I would try and connect directly. Any advice greatly appreciated.",

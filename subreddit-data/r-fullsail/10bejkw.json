There's a tendency in creatives to always be looking a few steps ahead of where they currently are.\n\nTake time to appreciate that you made it to the end of a project. It might not be perfect, but it's finished. Make notes of how you feel about it.\n\nEveryone's methods of dealing with imposter syndrome will be a bit different. For me it's helped a lot to reflect back on how I felt about my earliest projects vs these. I can actually point to things I think I did well, now. Before I didn't like anything about them.",

It's wondering if you stack up against others too. In the end, we chose a field that is essentially always going to be competition, but as long as you're creating stuff YOU'RE passionate about, nothing else matters.\n\nMy professor in my Master's told me that imposter syndrome is a part of any creative field and the best way to overcome it is working with like-minded individuals in similar or the same field because you'll find you're not alone and they may have tips to overcome it, be there to review what you've done and offer criticism.",

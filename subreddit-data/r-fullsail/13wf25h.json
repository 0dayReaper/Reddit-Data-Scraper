    "postText": "Hey everyone! So I officially started online classes at Full Sail on Monday. I\u2019m super excited and dove right into my coursework :) I just wanted to hop on here and give a little insight to how my first few days are going for anyone that may be interested in this program. \n\nMost programs are one class per month, with two possibly sprinkled in here and there. For CW, we are taking two courses right off the bat. While this is noted on their website in the program description, a lot of people don\u2019t realize that information is available so I figured I\u2019d mention it here. These first two courses in month 1 are Creative Presentation and Psychology of Play. \n\nIf you\u2019re jumping right into this after high school, I think you\u2019ll find the work super easy and quick to get through. I\u2019m 29 so I\u2019ve been out of school for quite some time, and while it\u2019s not really all that much work this week, it is a lot of reading so far for Creative Presentation. I opted to have Siri read out my chapters for me while driving and running errands, but even that took about two hours. Again, not a super long time but if that\u2019s an area you struggle to focus in, just be prepared for that. In addition to the reading, we have to analyze two TED talks this week. I haven\u2019t started that portion yet but it seems pretty straightforward. The instructor gave a specific outline for questions they want answered about your two chosen talks, so that\u2019s helpful. \nAs for Psychology of Play, I\u2019m actually having a lot of fun in this course so far! We were given four quests (assignments) and were told to choose two to complete. I chose to redesign my creative space and create a \u201cplay personalities\u201d crest. I found myself breezing through these and lost track of time :) there was a small bit of reading but it took hardly any time and the topic was really interesting so it kept my attention pretty well. All of my assignments for this week are completed in that class now.\n\n I\u2019ll be taking a break tomorrow so I don\u2019t get burnt out and then focusing the next couple days on that TED talk assignment for creative presentation. If anyone finds this kind of recap useful, I\u2019ll pop in here once in a while and give more updates to how things are going! For now, I\u2019m enjoying myself and I\u2019m happy to be back in school again :)",

It sounds like the teachers talk to each other in the two programs and if one program gets a cool lecture, they try their best to make sure the other program(s) that it\u2019s relevant to get the same experience. That being said, the online instructors are specifically online only, and the on campus instructors are on campus only. I like the set up and I\u2019ve learned so many things I\u2019ve never thought of as needing skill set wise. \n\nDo you have any specific questions?",

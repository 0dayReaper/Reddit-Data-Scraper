    "postText": "I've seen a lot so far looking into it, and everything everyone says contradicts itself. People say it's worth the money others say not at all. I'd be going into Game Design/Development (one of the two), which a lot of people can teach themselves. I can't. I almost failed most of my classes online last year so I'd be going on campus most likely, raising the price even more. I need someone to teach me new skills otherwise I either lose interest or it won't go through my head, which is why I'm even considering going. the networking opportunities seem amazing but then I see people claiming that it's bs. I really want to go into the gaming industry and this place seems like it can get me there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I want to go to Full Sail because I can't teach myself how to make a game but idk if it's worth the money.",

No easy answer here but hopefully what I said to them will be helpful to you as well:\n\n\u201cThe best advice I can give is you get out what you put in. I went through the Animation program and had an amazing time and learned a lot. That\u2019s only because I decided to focus all my efforts on the classes. You\u2019ll have some amazing and interesting classes and then you\u2019ll also have classes that you won\u2019t be so fond of.\nGetting value out of Full Sail is all about going the extra mile, and if you do you\u2019ll be highly rewarded. But I met lots of talented people that were my classmates that have struggled finding industry jobs post graduation because they simply didn\u2019t put in the effort. You\u2019ll be entering a highly competitive field and you\u2019ll need to do anything you can to stand out. And if you make good impressions on your professors many of them will go out of their way to help you.\nTake opportunities to start extra curricular projects with your friends and classmates. Start designing things outside of the curriculum and bring them to your teachers for guidance. Full Sail can be brutal sometimes due to time constraints on courses, but you\u2019ll find you have plenty of time outside of class to work. So in essence - give it your all and you\u2019ll reap the benefits.\u201d\n\nI graduated 4 years ago and have been moderately successful within my career post grad.  My success does not mean everyone who follows my path will be successful.  But if you\u2019re going to put down the money (a substantial amount to say the least) you better make it worth your while and get every single thing out of that school that you possibly can.",

I was sold a pipe dream in the music business program and almost 10 years later I am drowning in debt from this useless degree.",

            "comment": "It's a hard question to answer because it really depends on the degree you get, the current job opportunities for that degree and the effort you put into it. I went many, many years ago, and there were only two degree programs, Audio (which is what they were known for) and video/film. I made the mistake of doing video/film not actually knowing if that is what I wanted to do. Plus, it didn't help that I was fresh out of high school and still figuring out what I wanted to do when I grew up. If you were wishy-washy about what you truly want to do, then I would highly discourage going and waiting a couple years until you figure it out. A gap year between high school is not a bad thing, especially if you're not wasting money.",

    "postText": "I was wondering if there was any 2D animation courses at fullsail because when I tried to find one it would bring me to the computer animation course and it seems like it works mostly with 3D animation. Unless they are in the same course. Also how much would the tuition be. (Sorry if my question is confusing)",

The Computer Animation Bachelor's used to include a 2D animation course, but according to the [2021 course catalog](https://www.fullsail.edu/resources/brochure-file/full-sail-catalog.pdf) that no longer seems to be the case.\n\nThat said: If you're looking for a strictly 2D animation degree, you may find that difficult. I wouldn't imagine many places would offer a full degree in something like that since the jobs in the industry heavily favor 3D animation (Games, films, simulation, etc).\n\n*However,* the animation is animation. The principles do not change whether you're doing 3D, 2D, motion graphics, etc. Especially when it comes to character animations. If animation is truly something that interests you I would recommend that you don't bottleneck yourself into 1 particular discipline and do your best that finds a program that is well-rounded and meets your needs.\n\nYou can find tuition prices here: [https://www.fullsail.edu/admissions/tuition](https://www.fullsail.edu/admissions/tuition)",

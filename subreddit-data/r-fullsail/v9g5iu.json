Just be mindful of that. They're getting especially strict with attendance in the wake of the pandemic and pulling everyone off of online classes and back to classrooms. For example, if I were to miss one day of class (on my current schedule) and didn't have a doctor's note, I'd fail the entire class for the month. It wasn't always like this, but something's lit a fire under their rear ends in regards to 100% attendance.",

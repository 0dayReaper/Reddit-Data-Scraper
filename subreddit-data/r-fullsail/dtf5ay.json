    "postText": "Hello,\n\nCurrently enrolled in FSU online for DCBS I have been thinking about the camera I'll be receiving soon, the Sony FS5 Mark II. Technologically we have made a couple of leaps and bounds since the FS5 was released and I'm wondering if this is a camera we NEED to keep for course work. Is the FS5 required to use for projects or can I trade this thing in for another camera? say the BMPCC6K.\n\nMy enrollment in Full Sail aside, please. I'm perfectly happy buying my degree online\ud83e\udd23. Hoping someone out there has some experience. Thank you!",

The assignments we do require using the FS5 for at least 75% of the shots. Not saying they'd be able to tell, but I wouldn't take a chance personally.",

    "postText": "I'm enrolled to begin classes for the Music Business program in late August and I've recently been developing some concerns. All I really see online is Full Sail hate and people complaining about the classes and life after Full Sail. I can't find anyone with experience in the music business program though and that leaves me with unanswered questions. \n\nIs it worth it? Money aside, is the degree a worthwhile degree to get to follow a path you're passionate about?\n\nAre jobs as bountiful after graduation as Full Sail makes it out to be? \n\nI've heard you get out of Full Sail what you put into it, but that you'll have to put into it all of your time and effort for 20 straight months. I'm okay with that if it gets me where I want to be in life but will it?\n\nIs the school really not respected in the real world? It seems like people view Full Sail as a joke and a scam, saying the school is only in it for more money. \n\nAlso, anyone from a music/entertainment/business program at Full Sail, is there anything I need to know or do or prepare for before I go?",

I have learned so much since I started, and I was skeptical before I started because of the reviews I read.  But they really mean it if you put forth the effort, then opportunities are more likely to show up.  Also 3 months before you graduate, Career Development contacts you and starts preparing you for graduation in a sense that they help connect you to people in the field that you want to go in.  There are so many paths for me to take with my degree, live music, studio work, post-production, game audio, the list goes on.  \n\nI suggest talking to an advisor and asking their opinion as well.  Ask them for graduate job-rate stats for your degree and ask about all the different jobs you can do.",

    "postText": "I am currently enrolled. And I was told that I would get a MacBook four months in. I joined and started in September, working on getting a Creative Writing degree. I have already received my iPad. And I\u2019m just curious if I would receiving it in January or what? I\u2019m an online student if that means anything.\n\nI had a FedEx tracking link, and was under the assumption it was going to be the MacBook so I can use it to finish the final week of this months class. Just to get a book, called \u201cFlash Fiction\u201d. And it\u2019s a guide to writing, which probably should\u2019ve been sent in the beginning when I first applied and got accepted.\n\nEdit:\nLove how I post this and I get a tracking number a couple hours later. I didn\u2019t call tech or anything. I just got the thing and now I\u2019m sitting here like \u201c\ud83d\ude33\u201d they know I was asking about it!",

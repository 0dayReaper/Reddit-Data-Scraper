    "postText": "Hey guys, I just wanted to make a post because I have this question.. I am currently accepted to go learn and major in Show Production while on-campus. But the problem is, I greatly want to learn at least a basic level of music composition and using digital workstations to do it as well. Is it even possible to do a major, with a side class or two? or is it impossible at this university?",

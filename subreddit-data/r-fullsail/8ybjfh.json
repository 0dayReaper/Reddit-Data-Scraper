    "postText": "Hello everybody.\n\nPast month was a wild ride for me because countless self teaching and freelance work in my high school years paid off by landing me a well paid job as a video game programmer.\n\nI decided to do not leave for Breda University of Applied Sciences after all and apply for a local university with a CS degree. But Full Sail University caught my eye. I am aware it is not for the lazy, the high burnout rate and that you get back whatever effort you put into it.\n\nBut how about time wise? Would I be able to follow Full Sail University's online courses while maintaining a full time a job as a programmer?\n\nRight now I am looking into the next courses:\n\n\\-Game Design: Often working on my projects I had to take care of design too. I think it might fit nicely with my work as a programmer and would help me polish and extra set of skills that will prove useful.\n\n\\-Mobile Development: I have done a lot of work on mobile and I am a fan of serious mobile game development. The company that hired me as a programmer is also a respectable company with years of work in mobile game development. So mobile development comes as a possible choice on the list.\n\n\\-Software Development: I am a programmer after all and this is an obvious choice.\n\nWith this being said, I want to thank you in advance for answers, suggestions and tips!",

It's a struggle, I spend most mornings before going into work(shift starts at 2 PM) doing my studying/homework and then coming home and sleep. However, it is absolutely doable. It really is a situation where effort put in directly correlates to what you get out of it. \n\ntldr; if you're okay with the crunch, you can do it.",

Especially the last 4 months, you're expected to put in *at bare minimum* 20 hours of work a week on your project. It can be done though! Just make sure your friends and family know that they basically won't see you for large swaths of time due to your school load.",

Because with $450 for credited hour means that the first month course is $1350.\n\nI guess I have to keep paying 450 * hours each month, am I right? Or do I have to pay $54000 at the start of the course?",

From what she says it\u2019ll be rough and some sleepless nights but worth it in the end. She\u2019s who inspired me to go to full sail to begin with. I\u2019m in month 9 out if 29(extended) for show production and touring which is a campus only degree and I\u2019m also working 2 part time jobs and attempting to attend all the events and opportunities that fullsail has to offer while also being a tutor for full sail.  It is 100% do able. You just will have to prioritize. Full sail will also work with you. I got this months class changed to an easier one so I could pick up more hours to bring in money for my house hold while my fianc\u00e9 is on summer break( she\u2019s a teacher). ",

Along with doing online classes for the university, I am working 35-40 hours a week over night at a gas station. I usually go into work from  11pm-7am, so I break it down for myself to have enough time to do my classes, rest for a couple of hours, and then go to work. On my days off because my job usually give me Sunday and Monday off of work those are usually my days to strictly focus on my classwork for more than 2-4 hours because my mother and husband are off on those days and they can handle the 4 rambunctious children running around so I can work on my studies. I am entering my 4th month in the program.   \nI am only going on my 3rd month at my job.\n\nI know its going to be a bit challenging but I am sure you'll be able to do it. Keep up the great work.",

I watch my children and have time to finish my assignments is good time. One main reason I enrolled was that I can have it work around my schedule and family time. I use my own laptop and find time to go to a cafe for a few hours to finish at least one class. Then usually bust out 2 on one of my days off. I can already see it's going to take alot of work but it has helped me be more mentally active both with learning and my kids. My recommendation to everyone it to buy a kindle. I bought one and downloaded the books, it keeps me focused instead of playing around. Plus the battery lasts a week so you dont have to always worry about charging it.",

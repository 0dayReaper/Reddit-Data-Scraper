If I withdraw, will I still receive the laptop &amp; other contents of my Launchbox?\nThe equipment is already paid for, so I would assume so, but I was just curious if anyone knows protocol on this. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Unfortunately no, you will not be receiving any of your remaining LaunchBox items; while you've \"technically\" paid for it, it is included as part of your tuition and isn't refunded to you.   \nHOWEVER, you can totally keep the items you \\*did\\* receive!   \nI'm a former online student that had to drop out around the beginning of the pandemic, and I am returning for in-person courses shortly. I didn't receive the remaining items from my previous launchbox either; though I'm sure I was a bit further into my degree.   \n\n\nIf you do return to the school at a later date, you might be very heartened to know they will help you obtain your LaunchBox items upon speaking with an Academic ReLaunch advisor. Alternatively, contact your Student Advisor - they are available to you even after dropping out! They'd likely be pleased to answer any questions you have about the LaunchBox items you didn't get.  \n\n\nBest of luck in your endeavours!",

    "postText": "Hello, I am currently a senior attending highschool looking at colleges for game art and I'm considering applying to full sail for their game art program but I'm concerned with a few things I've heard about this school, I've looked through this reddit a good bit and seen some negative things concerning money and traps and whatnot but I've also seen some really in depth and passionate responses to others looking at attending, although I'm still worried about things like accreditation at this school and whether or not employers will actually accept a degree from this university, as well as whether or not the teachers actually give you in depth information and help you learn things that you would otherwise have a very hard time learning on your own, also whether or not I'd be able to maintain a job with the workload of the game art program, I would be extremely grateful if people who are graduates from the past 3 years or are currently enrolled in the game arts program could help me with these questions",

Theres just too much to know.\nHope it helps",

    "postText": "Hello all I am seriously looking at getting my Bachelors in Digital Cinematography online from Full Sail but I want to make sure it's the best fit before I make any financial commitment.\n\nI am highly dedicated to this field. I have tried to learn as much as I can on my own making several short films and writing screenplays. I also took as many film classes while I was working on my associates degree as I could.\n\nHow do people like this program? Did you learn a lot? Do you feel it prepared you for work in the industry?",

It helped me polish my portfolio and create some very good pieces. \n\nI think it\u2019s worth it! I chose the school mainly for learning to navigate the industry. After graduation you still have resources/access to counselors who will review your demo reel and resume. They check in every few months.",

In person I had problems with the program and couldn't get it working for a few months, he wouldn't give me a grade on that assignment because I couldn't do it, however he increased grades on other assignments so I could pass the class with a 90 since I couldn't do that.",

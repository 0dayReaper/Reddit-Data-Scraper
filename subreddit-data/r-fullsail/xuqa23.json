    "postText": "I was super excited until I started reading this sub and other reviews on the internet. Most of the negativity I've seen about the school does not seem to come from sportscasting students and the few reviews of that program I've seen have all been pretty positive. But how much should I heed all those other warnings? I'm incredibly passionate about sportscasting and don't doubt it's what I want to do. \n\nStill, one of the more consistent criticisms I've seen is how bad they are at communicating. Kind of already seeing this myself since they've had my FAFSA for nearly two full weeks but haven't called me to talk about aid yet (I've called back up multiple times and scheduled 3 callbacks that were never followed up on) Is this going to be a consistent experience for the next 29 months?\n\nI did do one year of college when I was 18 but had to drop out before my sophomore year because of my gpa being low. This seems my best chance to get back to school and do what I'm passionate about without all the nonsense of going to a community college to rebuild my gpa and then the hassle of going back to a four year.\n\nAny general advice, pointers, experiences (positive or negative) or anyone having been in my similar situation would be so helpful. Thanks :)",

The campus also sustained at least some damage. In addition, many work-from-home staff members are still without power or internet. Things are certainly moving a bit slower as a result.",

There\u2019s a vocal minority of unhappy and very happy people. \n\nThere\u2019s a wide middle ground of people who aren\u2019t complaining and singing praises. \n\nThe admissions side is overloaded. They\u2019re spending time on students who will never start or drop out immediately. But there\u2019s a ton of them. \n\nAll school is a you get out what you put in equation.",

Make sure to cc student support and student advocacy in emails, I also got the WhatsApp for my international advisor, which helped with response time. Classes are fast paced, keep up with assignments and contact your instructors if any issues, they are very helpful and seem to want you to succeed if you are making an effort, good luck and pm if any questions.",

Email your next instructor a couple days before the class starts. Just to let them know you're excited for the class. Don't lay it on think, just be brief, professional, and positive.\n\nEstablishing relationships with instructors will help smooth everything else out.",

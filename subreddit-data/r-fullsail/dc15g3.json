    "postText": "So I took the plunge and am serious about putting in the effort to get the most out of my degree and the experience shared through these courses. That being said I've seen semi answers on this searching through the threads here and am curious as far as someone with little to no experience coding. I am not worried about learning it through the courses, that said I never seen anyone confirm or deny that experience coding is or is not needed for design. Speaking to my admissions rep he said there is some C\\# and C++ that will be taught and all through Unity and Unreal.\n\nWhat I would like to know how at a disadvantage am I with not knowing much about coding and is there anything i can do while i wait this next month for my courses to start that i can do to get a head start? Is even a headstart even needed?",

            "comment": "Congrats on starting classes soon! As an FYI for the basis of my answer, I\u2019m a grad from the online Game Art program, but I know a few ppl in the design program, and overall my answer should work universally. \n\nFull Sail certainly doesn\u2019t require precious knowledge or experience to start classes. They\u2019re beginner friendly. However, the materials for class alone aren\u2019t enough to really master and excel at your work. You will definitely need to put in some extra time. For design, you\u2019re going to focus on coding, and the game engine you\u2019ll be learning is Unity. This is great as it\u2019s really beginner friendly and code focused, but I can also tell you from experience in the long term you likely won\u2019t use Unity unless you work for an indie studio that\u2019s still using it. I would dabble in UE4 on the side and learn some c++. This experience is much more likely to get you s job later on. \n\nAlso, the game artists you\u2019ll eventually work with only learn to use Unreal, so in the Game Production class where we make all your art assets for the game you\u2019ve been working on, just know we have no idea how to use Unity or how to really help import our models and build shaders. Experience with Unreal will help bridge that knowledge gap, so you can better relate to the artists.",

The admissions guidance person I was talking to had told me C\\# and C++ were curriculum now as well as unreal, I was slightly skeptical on C++ and Unreal since I have yet to find anything here or on their site that was evident of that.\n\n  \n\n\nThat said, I have been going though codecademy as of last night doing the C++ course and intended on figuring out a way to learn how to use unreal since the epic store I believe has the engine available for open use.",

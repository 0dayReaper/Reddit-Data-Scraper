Up until I went though both the first programming classes I had very little experience, it was incredibly difficult to get through them and I even failed my first Month of it, but I kept at it and now I'm much more confident in my ability to learn how to code and apply it to new school work. In my class right now, we are currently working on conways game of life, logic and all.",

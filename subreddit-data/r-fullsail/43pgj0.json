    "postText": "I'm just finishing up a dual bachelors degree in Gaming and Computer Science, and I'm curious about trying out Full Sail's Mobile Gaming Masters Degree program.\n\nI've been making mobile games for the last two-three years and have about twenty on the iTunes Store so far, but I'm not very technically proficient and think this might help. Has anyone had or knows of someone who has had experience with this or could recommend a better class.\n\n\nLinks to most of my apps are here:https://www.facebook.com/JustkingGames\n\n\n(A few aren't free. Message me if you want a promo code)\n\n\nAnd I'm recording my journey of making a game a week here:http://justkinggames.tumblr.com/",

I can answer any kind of specific question you have but (Disclaimer:) I am a course director at Full Sail so I will be unquestionably bias but I will try my best to be honest.\n",

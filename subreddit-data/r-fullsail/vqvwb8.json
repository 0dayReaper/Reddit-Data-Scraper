Is there anyway i can see the class time slots or any information on the class schedule before enrolling? Or is there an option to take the classes a-synchronously?  \nI\u2019m wanting to get my degree but MAN rent and car payments suck lol.\n\nEDIT: Im looking at online exclusively",

I've heard of such accommodations in the past, but that was pre-covid. Nowadays I imagine they'd steer you towards an online degree due to your schedule, but give them a call and see.",

Would you recommend it? Any advice?",

In recent months, however, things have improved and we're all back on campus again. Heck, some of the work that I see students posting on Discord for the 3D Fundamentals class is MILES better than what we were doing in 2020, so I think a lot of improvements have been made.\n\nIt's a great school and I've learned more than I ever could on my own. I'd recommend it but only if you're prepped to be personable &amp; motivated throughout the degree program, otherwise you may end up in that % of folks that feel that they wasted their money. You absolutely have to be willing to get in &amp; do the extra work so that you can have a portfolio that will get you hired.. Unfortunately a lot of folks think the piece of paper is a definite ticket into the industry and find out the hard way that no one wants to hire them because all they have in their demo reel are ball bounces, character idle animations, etc..\n\nThat being said, the campus offers lots of different opportunities for portfolio/demo-reel reviews from industry professionals &amp; talent scouts, for both online &amp; campus students. Not enough people take advantage of that, in my opinion.",

I'm half way through my second year of CABS and its pretty straight forward. There are somethings about the school that p*ss me off. But as far as what your concerned with online is easy to schedule around. Be warned though this can also make it more difficult. Some classes/projects are extremely time demanding. I've even had an instructor say he doesn't know how a person working full time can pass his class. \n\nAlso you are pretty much on your own. At least thats been my experience.",

Each class varies for due dates but I would say the bigger projects are due on Sunday at 11:59. I found it tiring to balance full time and the course load of the classes (but I do get tired pretty easily). I do love learning about this stuff though so it's worth it to me if you can find a balance.",

    "postText": "I'm starting the Computer Animation course on the third and was wondering if it was worth buying all of the 'required' reading sources the syllabus has listed out for us. Since classes only last a month and in total, the books will cost over $100 (for just renting), I wasn't sure if they will be necessary in getting good grades or extra education the instructors won't be providing. I would appreciate feedback from any alumni who have done the online course for Computer Animation, but also just in general.",

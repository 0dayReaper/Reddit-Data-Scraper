Now that I have left the school they have started coming after me trying to get more money even though I am NOT EVEN A STUDENT ANYMORE! Anyone else who has dealt with this can you please give me some advice? They have me by the throat and I feel completely trapped. It is impossible to get in touch with anyone at the school besides a representative. This is completely ridiculous and I need help ASAP!",

It makes complete sense why Full Sail University is Nationally accredited because the school is trying to keep current. \n\nAs far as Full Sail is a for-profit school, you are correct, but what school isn\u2019t for-profit? College football coaches make a ton of money, and universities make a ton of merchandise. The difference between Full Sail and a traditional school is Full Sail isn\u2019t getting government money to sustain its resources.

Some CEO is not getting rich from it all.  The state and government are making money, but they don't really need the cash, so money doesn't drive the educational decisions.  Not that the government can do things better, but it's the motivation behind a for profit that is scary.  Imagine going to a for profit hospital hmm...sounds like they'd accidentally add in some additional tests and courses of action to stay in business.  With the government backing college funding they could sit empty but paychecks would still be distributed because college isn't a business - it should be student-centric with lower tuition costs in mind.\n\nHistorically very shady practices have went on when you look at ITT and similar for profit colleges, and honestly it isn't the greatest feeling when you find out years later that your college basically went under for fraud, and their name has been run through the mud.",

Like any university, it had to match the curriculum (apples to apples). FS is already unique in its approach, so transfer credits are tougher to bring in. But the accreditation is what is best for the school. Full Sail is a technical/career university. Their accreditation matches what they are teaching. \n\nI went to a traditional university for my undergraduate degree. If you don\u2019t think higher-ups are making a ton of money, then I have no idea how to alter your perception. State-funded schools are far from \u201cnon-profit.\u201d I agree that education should be student-centric with lower tuition costs. Still, when I look at Full Sail vs. a traditional school (for the most part), their tuition isn\u2019t that much higher, and I also have no idea how a school can keep costs down with the way college tuition has been skyrocketing over the past two decades. \n\nFull Sail has given me a ton of opportunities and connections. My career is tremendous, and like any school, it is what you put into it. The only people I meet who think Full Sail\u2019s name has been \u201cdragged through the mud\u201d are people the school was not suitable for them.

My position is not that private schools are by default better than public schools. My position is that there is a well documented trend, even in public education, of more and more money being spent on board compensation, administrative salaries, and on campus amenities (new buildings with donors' names on them, sports complexes, etc.), while less money is spent on student support, faculty salaries (or hiring faculty at all), and various things that would categorically improve the quality of education. All this is happening while tuition rates continue to rise at an increasing rate, private banks reap in profits from federally-backed loans that students can never shed, and universities (public and private) court donors and investors whose relationships with curricula is becoming more and more questionable.\n\nIf you want my idealistic opinion on colleges (and education more broadly), I think it should all be entirely publicly funded and available for free to everyone. I think a broad range of options should be available to students, from technical/vocational schools to large research universities, community colleges to certificate academies. All for no \\[direct\\] cost to the students, funded entirely by the public (through taxes). Hopefully that clears up my position on for-profit education as a concept.\n\n&gt;How are public universities cheaper than private?\n\nThey are not all cheaper than all private universities. There is a range of costs in both categories. The reasons why one university (public or private) may be more expensive than another are numerous and vary from school to school.\n\n&gt;What is the benefit of a private college accepting C students with a questionable reputation versus a public college?\n\nI'm not sure I understand this question. By \"C students\" do you mean their grades in high school? Public universities don't categorically deny students who graduated high school with less than a 3.0 GPA. Some private universities have very strict academic requirements for applicants. So do some public schools. I'm also not sure what you mean by \"questionable reputation.\" Do you mean academic reputation? A criminal history? Or just non-traditional students (older adults, parents, etc.)? Public schools accept all of these students, yes, and some private schools do, as well. A 38-year-old ex-con *may* feel more comfortable at a private school that has a higher average student age, though, than they would at a public school with a bunch of people 20 years younger.\n\n&gt;What makes Full Sail better than a public college?\n\nThat will depend on which public college we're wanting to compare it to, what student we're talking to, and which degree program we're talking about. Trying to ask why **one** private school is \"better\" than, I guess, the concept of public school, is pretty wild. Full Sail isn't *better* for everyone, and whichever public school you want to compare it to won't be *better* for everyone, either.\n\nIf I wanted to go to film school, there are a variety of options. FSU (Florida State University) may have a higher rated film school than UT Austin, but I live in Texas and get in-state tutition at UT Austin, don't have to move (or move far), so that school may be the better choice for me, even if it doesn't measure as high as FSU on a handful of metrics. (I have no idea how good either of these film programs are, just using them as an example. Don't @ me.)\n\nI used two public schools there, but you could sub in any private school, and the calculations would still be the same. Why choose one school over another? Lots of reasons. \"Better\" is subjective, contextual, personal.\n\n&gt;Is it the reputation?\n\nFor some students in some programs, yes. For other students in other programs, maybe not. The reputation of the school was not a significant factor in my own decision-making process, but I cannot speak directly to anyone else's priorities.\n\n&gt;Is it the tuition being cheaper?\n\nDepends on the program and the public college we're comparing it to. When I was looking at schools, Full Sail came in a little cheaper than other schools (some public, some private) for a similar degree. The fact that my tuition, in part, paid for equipment that I would get to keep was a large factor in my choice.\n\n&gt;Is it guaranteed job placement?\n\nFull Sail isn't guaranteeing job placement. They can't. Or, rather, they know that even if they handed grads jobs, some number of those grads just wouldn't follow through. The school offers career services and counseling for grads, though I haven't graduated yet so I can't personally speak to the quality of those services.\n\n&gt;What about the quality of education, are people jumping out of Full Sail and landing excellent careers with outrageous benefits?\n\nThe quality of education is going to depend on the student, the instructor, and the program director (dean). Just like at any school. Again, this is a really uselessly broad comparison to look at Full Sail vs public schools overall.\n\nAnd the same for landing excellent careers. We've all read the hundreds of news stories about college grads from private and public schools who hold tens of thousands of dollars in debt and can't find work, or struggle to make more than minimum wage. Like with any school, Full Sail grads are entering a difficult labor market. Does Full Sail give students an edge over public schools? On that scale, probably not. Does it give a student an edge over the couple of public schools they were also considering? Maybe it does.",

But there's less of an issue if a private college does this because it is their business.  They run the school like a business (kind of scary).  Students pay them money for a product, and they use the money however they see fit.  The owner also makes a lot of cash.\n\n&gt;\"Better\" is subjective, contextual, personal.\n\nBetter is not always subjective or personal.  Logically, this is always the case:  1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3.  If I pick 2, but pay for 3, that's not quantitatively better unless 2 is has greater qualitative value than 3.  I'm trying to figure out how that is the case here, but no one can explain how Full Sail is a superior institution.\n\nWhat science you follow, or refuse to follow, determines what is better for you.  Scientifically, does it make sense to go to Full Sail instead of MIT, well maybe, if you can't get into MIT and would like to spend $25,000 per year on tuition, I'd say that's a resounding yes.\n\n&gt;The reputation of the school was not a significant factor in my own decision-making process\n\nThere is no regional accreditation, and tuition is outrageously expensive, so those are significant factors that should be taken into consideration, but if potential students refuse to look at that, then more money will be made (not by the students, of course).\n\n&gt;The fact that my tuition, in part, paid for equipment that I would get to keep\n\nFor students that pay their own tuition out of pocket, the student, not the tuition, pays for that equipment.  I'd much rather have $10,000 less tuition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Again, this is a really uselessly broad comparison to look at Full Sail vs public schools overall.\n\nI don't think it's useless.

However, being brainwashed is also an option until post-graduation:  $2,000 per month student loan payments while serving fast food for 30 years.",

Again, this will vary from school to school. Some public schools invest in good faculty, some in elaborate athletic facilities.

If you want to play college football, you'll pick a college with an exceptional football team.\n\n&gt;Logically, this is always the case: 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3.

MIT is also a private school, though. I'm not sure what your point is supposed to be, here? If you're comparing a program at Full Sail to a program at one of the top private colleges in the country, then yes, Full Sail is not going to measure up. But MIT doesn't have a film program, so anyone wanting to study film won't be looking at MIT. This is exactly what I mean when I say \"better\" is subjective and contextual.\n\nNot everyone at Full Sail had MIT on their radar. Not everyone at Full Sail could move to attend MIT, or wants to go to a program offered by MIT. MIT is an apt comparison for only a small number of Full Sail applicants. And yeah, you might be one of them, but it's weird to hold the two schools as a whole up to each other outside of their overlapping degrees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to tell you, man. It seems like you've made up your mind that Full Sail isn't right for you, and I'm not interested in convincing you otherwise. I think, as I said in my last post, that it's a personal, subjective decision. I have my reasons for choosing Full Sail, and for choosing the degree at Full Sail that I'm in. You have your reasons fro not choosing Full Sail. That's fine. But please don't pick a public university thinking they have some inherent interest in providing the best education. They don't. Pick a college, public or private, for profit or not for profit, that is the best fit for you and your career goals. That's all. If going to a public college is important to you, do that. If going to MIT is important to you, do that. If picking a college on the oppose side of the country from your parents is important to you, do that.",

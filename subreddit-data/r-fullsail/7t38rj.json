    "postText": "reveiws I've found and some reasearch I've done have told me that Full Saill has \"gone down the drain\", \"not worth the time\", \"wont be worth anything\" and so on. A family friend that was an alumni from the school, aswell as some siblings of mine currently attending (game design) say that its a great place. The Game Art program is looking like exactly what i think that i would want to do. Is it true that its gotten really bad or are people giving it a bad name, and attending is worth it*? Some people also say that when people hiring see full sail degrees, that it lowers your chances. Is this also true?\n\n*Extra info= small amount of time messing with Blender but nothing beyond basic shapes, no formal drawing lessons but ive gotten okish at 2d over time, transitiioning to computer drawings recently, will be attending the online not on campus.",

We also get a lynda.com account with no restrictions so you can even branch out. \n\nI think they give Fullsail hell because it is different than a four year college...or they flunked out.

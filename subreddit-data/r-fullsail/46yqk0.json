    "postText": "I try not to blame my problems on other people and I will admit that I have tended to slack off a few times while attending Full Sail but I have a huge dilemma with an instructor. I am an online student in the Audio Production program. As we all know we are given assignments weekly that we must allocate the right time to, complete, and submit by the due date. I am about to start the fourth week in my class and my instructor has only graded two assignments in the past months. She gives very vague instruction and will not respond to any of us when we ask her to help us or elaborate. I'll give an example. One assignment she gave us was to \"make a presentation talking about all of the various fields and subfields in the Audio Arts industry. We all asked her if she could help us to narrow that assignment and she never responded. We have sent her messages multiple times that she simply will not respond to. I have made two F's and one D and I have no feedback to improve my assignments and when I send messages I get no response. I feel that this is completely unfair to all of us students and it's setting us all back. What should I do? Who do I talk to about our instructor? Literally, the only piece of feedback she's given us was a huge message talking about how she will not respond on weekends and there was no excuse for late work. I am getting frustrated as I normally do very well in my classes...",

    "postText": "Hi /r/FullSail\n\nMy husband is halfway through his computer animation degree here. We are looking for ways to improve networking and his experience which he feels lacking since he is online and not in the industry yet (only doing school). We are based in South Florida. \n\nOnline Alumni: \n\nwhat would you have done differently? \n\nAre there professional organizations or conventions you wished you attended while in school? \n\nAny websites/networking events that you recommend? \n\nAnything would be helpful. He's worried he's going to graduate and not be competitive.",

            "comment": "I graduated from Computer Animation a few years ago. One of the things they pushed a lot was [CGSociety](http://www.cgsociety.org/). It's been a great community for computer animation since the beginning of time, and much of the most impressive 3D art gets posted there first. It's a very good place to meet people, get help, critiques, etc.\n\nIn addition, if you can afford it, [SIGGRAPH](http://www.siggraph.org/) is *the* convention for the discipline. All of the big announced in computer animation happen there. Students also get a discount, if I recall correctly.\n\nI haven't been on Orgsync in awhile, but if it's possible, look for game students looking for artist for projects, or see if you can't get involved in a 24 hour game jam remotely. Any opportunity to both network *and* expand your portfolio is good.\n\nFinally get to know your classmates, even if remotely. Make a private Facebook group, get connected on some kind of messenger, anything to keep in contact. Of the friends that I graduated with many went on to work on feature films and triple A games. I didn't any up doing anything that serious, but all of them are always willing to offer up help when I'm curious, and a few of them have given me guidelines to fast track getting hired at their respective studios if I were every interested. It's definitely a good connection to have.",

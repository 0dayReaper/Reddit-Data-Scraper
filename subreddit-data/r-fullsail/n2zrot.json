    "postText": " \n\nWent  to this college had a great time until one teacher who decided she  hated me and failed me after i did ALL the work required and gave 100%  attendance, and when i complained to the school they totally just took  her side and tried to make me re pay to take the class, which was pass/fail. Do the work required still get fuck, but according to y'all that was my fault.  Fuck this school  all they care about is money , greedy cock suckers like every other  organization in america. Bullies doing everything they can to fuck over  the poor. Nice guys who really do get fucked hard.\n\nI  failed the class once, tried to retake was force to re-pay i tried to  fight, they told me I owe more money I couldn't take on more loans,  nobody would listen... but still my fault for going where i needed doing  what I needed.... I deserve it I guess fuck me for existing...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClearly this community/school is full of bullies, just like when I went there, entitles bullies, I know your rich privilege makes you feel like you are better than everybody else, but clearly this is a school for of ignorant bully ass cunts. Y'all got a lot of hate to spread, but hate me for being mad for a reason... Easy to defend a school, that has all the defense it needs, where's the people who stick up for the defenseless people like me? Nobody? of course not why would we help our fellow man when we can belittle and destroy them even further.... all i get more bullies piling on, keep it coming cunts. I'll I've ever received is your hate anyways, bring it on.",

I'm sure the user is just venting because of a high-stress situation with no real recourse. \n\nI can imagine how they acted when they had actual stakes. This is not employable behavior.\n\nTake responsibility for yourself and what happens to you, even if it's not your fault. You can't blame the school if you do poorly, and you can turn in every assignment and still fail if the assignments are garbage. Your user history on this forum shows toxicity and hatefulness that isn't useful to the community, nor does it foster discussion on things that need improvement. It's just vitriol from an unhappy student who didn't know what they signed up for. \n\n\nAnd for the record:\n\n&gt;I know your rich privilege makes you feel like you are better than everybody else, but clearly this is a school for of ignorant bully ass cunts.    \n\nLol. The irony here is bittersweet.",

Now its onky down to 60k bc of scholarships and grants. Itll keep going down the more i look for them. This school isn\u2019t against the poor if they literally give you money and the resources to succeed. If you have a problem with this, next semester forward take it online. Its cheaper.",

I was hit by this when I didn't realize the policy had changed but my tuition covered the additional $500.  It's a huge change that was not well communicated.\n\nLife is a lot of playing stupid games by other people's rules until you find yourself in a position to change the rules.",

    "postText": "I've seen a lot of posts about Full Sail, is it good, bad is it a scam? As a (successfull?) FS Alumni i figured I'd share a bit of my experience. \n\nI'm going to hold off on personal details for now (I'm a tad paranoid); but maybe in the future i'll do a full writeup with more details.\n\nI started FullSail in 2008, graduated in 2010. I attended the Game Development (programming) course. I had a 50k job the day after graduation. It's been 5 years since graduating; i'm now making 120k.\n\nGoing back to the beginning, i was never NEVER any good at math.\nI almost failed Pre Calc twice! I passed by 3% the second time. This is where the first bit of advice i have about Fullsail comes in. NETWORK!\n\nI was bad at math, but pretty decent at coding. I found others who seemed to have a better grasp on the math side of things in my class and i invited them over to study. Usually we had a few Pizzas and a beer ball. We started studying and drinking at the same time. I think having fun and getting to know each other was just as important as the studying. \n\nWe kept this up troughout the rest of the schoolyear. Once or twice a month (sometimes once or twice a week!) We'd all get together, drink and study and talk about programming / math. If you want to do this, get a few whiteboards and hang them up. It helps! Being outgoing and talking to people can be a bit tough, but the booze helps!\n\nAfter about a year (During the structure of game production class?) i was approached by one of the teachers, he asked me if i wanted to be a student monitor for the open lab. Of course i said yes. That ate up an additional 4 hours of my day. Why me and not one of my other class mates? Because i demonstrated that i did more!\n\nThis is where my second tip comes in, WORK MORE! You get at least one book every month with each class. How many of them have you read cover to cover? How many questions have you tried to answer on stack overflow? How many times have you posted for help on GameDev.net? Shool is hard, and demanding. 8 hours a day is a lot, i know. But it's not enough!\n\nEveryone you go to school with will be there for 8 hours! That WILL NOT make you stand out! By the time SGP was finished i had made two full games! They where 2D and the code behind them makes me cringe today; but i had two more finished games than my classmates. I would spend anywhere from 4 to 8 hours after school reading books, being active online and trying to make my own games.\n\nThe time to start thinking about your carreer is the last few months of school. For me, it was the last month and a half of final projects. I NEVER met with Rob (Career advisor when i went to FS). I heard the feedback he gave on resumes and i HATED IT! You need a website, some business cards and a KICK ASS RESUME! Sadly when i attended FS was not equiped to help with ANY of these issues!\n\nThis leads me to my third tip, PRESENTATION! Learn how to present yourself to potential employers!\n\nNowdays i am involved in hiring new graduates. The biggest thing that annoys me on resumes? \"Git, Alienbrain, SVN\". If anything is on your resume, be prepared to talk about it for at least 20 minutes (Looking at you EVERYONE WHO PUTS ASM ON A RESUME) I don't care about what tools you use, nor will any other employers. We will teach you tools, you need to demonstrate that you can code! The key to a strong resume is PROJECTS! \n\nI could do a whole nother post about resumes, so i will end my rant there. Learn git, set up a github.io site (If you want to get fancy buy a domain name, you can do it trough google these days). Get on codecademy and learn to write some HTML. Now go and make yourself a website!\n\nAfter setting up a website and making a visually appealing resume i went ahead and wrote a professional sounding email template introducing myself and asking for a position at the company i was sending it to. I then went onto gamedevmap and sent out an email to EVERY STUDIO ON THERE! Then i sent out an email to everyone hiring on the gamasutra job board. All in all i sent out almost 600 emails. \n\nThe result of this time consuming herculian effort? 7 interviews! 3 of them didn't go so well. Of the 4 left two where phone only, and two flew me out for an on-site! I did my best and two weeks before graduation i had two offer letters. One for an unknown company offering 50k in South Carolina and one for a BIG Tripple-A studio in Massachusetts offering 42k.\n\nBeing money driven as i was, i took the 50K offer. IT WAS A GREAT DECISION! On this job i got to learn Unity. Unity3D is probably the most in demand skill on the job market today. LEARN UNITY! After about a year of working in South Carolina a friend of mine from school called me up (Remember, NETWORK!), they had a job opening and i applied.\n\nNailed the interview and got the job. Of all places it was in Massachusetts, for a small studio that specialized in game porting. This job paid 62k, which at the time i thought was a nice jump in salary. I worked at this place for 6 months, I WAS MISERABLE! To this day i don't know what had made me so miserable in that position, but after 6 months i couldn't take it!\n\nI started looking for other jobs, not knowing how else to do it i started shotgunning my resume again. This was CRAZY! I'd get an on site interview in another state, i'd take a sick day fly out in the morning, do an all day interview, fly back in the evening and be back at work the next day! I flew to a lot of places in a very short amount of time. It was during one of these trips that i fell in love with San Francisco.\n\nAfter about 4 weeks i found a job near SF, and i took it. I took two weeks off between the jobs, then moved across the country to live in SF. This new job was paying me 85k. I was once again working with Unity, and i liked my coworkers. But the project was DOOMED! After a year and a half we didn't ship (the game had been in development for MUCH LONGER) and i had lost faith in both the project and company.\n\nAt this point i updated my linked in, and to my surprise... RECRUITERS!!!! Apparently i had enough experience now that when my LinkedIn showed signs of life recruiters where after me. It took all of a week to lock down a new job in San Francisco. For the first time i was working for a SMALL startup. But at least i got another salary boost, i was now making 95k.\n\nI LOVED THIS PLACE! To date it was my favorite place to work, and i never wanted to quit. But startups in SF don't last long. After a year the place went bust. We where given 1 months notice; once again i was looking for a job. I didn't want to move away from SF, so i updated my linked in and shotgunned out my resume to all AF companies making games.\n\nI got a bite! Within two weeks of starting the search (with two weeks left on that 1 month notice) i had signed a contract at a MAJOR game studio in SF. I got a bump again, but a small one. I was now making 100k. I liked working for a large corporation, the work was good, the IP was good and the people where good. \n\nEven tough the people where good i didn't really have any friends. I guess i wasn't really a cultural fit for the company. But the job was OK so i kept doing it. One year after starting an old coworker from the company that went under called me up. Said he had a job for me if i wanted. I liked the idea of working with him again so i took the interview, got an offer and took the job.\n\nThis time i had a sizable pay bump. I'm once again working for an uncertain startup, but i'm now making 120k. And i'm happy! I can't wait to see what the future holds. This great opportunity came as a result of networking, i can't stress how important this is!\n\nWhen i moved to San Francisco i was making 85k. Living in the same area with the same cost of living i'm now making 120k. It's a LOT more comfortable. So, what does my future hold? Well i'm not sure. I think realistically i have a salary cap of 150k, and within the next 5 years i will probably hit it. I'll figure things out once i have hit that cap.\n\nSo, considering a degree at fullsail? Is it worth it? If you want to go to school, do what they tell you, get a degree and get a job then it's not worth it. If you can go to school, do what they tell you AND ON TOP OF THAT WORK YOUR FINGERS TO THE BONE WHILE IN SCHOOL; figure out a direction and go in it, then yes for you it is worth going!\n\nTo recap, what i would consider steps to success at FullSail:\n1) Network and make friends. No man is an island!\n2) All of your friends want your future job! Work more, work harder, work smarter!\n3) Presentation is EVERYTHING! Learn some web design, make a killer website and resume!\n\nI know this writeup was long, and a bit of a mess but it's my story... And my life, despite the awesome income is a bit of a mess. I'll try to answer any questions in the comments, but i'm new to reddit i might get lost in cat pictures first.",

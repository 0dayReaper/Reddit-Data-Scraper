Most major universities are regionally accredited. It creates some complications with transfer credits, but it's not \\_impossible\\_. \n\nTypically the accepting school will need to decide whether or not they accept the credits based on the curriculum. A lot of Full Sail's classes are specialized and don't necessarily equal 1:1 with what another university would consider acceptable. Psychology of Play, for example, may not meet the Psychology requirement of other universities.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, it really depends on the university. You'd need to sit down with the admissions department and almost bargain it. Someone I know graduated from game design and pursued a master's at UCF. He eventually did get them to accept him, but it took some letters of recommendation, negotiations, prerequisites, and things like that. \n\nIt just depends on who you're dealing with and what you're trying to do.",

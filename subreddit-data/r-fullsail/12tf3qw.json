I thought a book of some sort, but that wouldn't make sense. In my 5 years of schooling, I've not once had a physical textbook. I did get a course directors award for a course though, maybe its that? But it said 5 lbs, and the iPad when IT came said like 1.8 lbs or something. So it doesn't make much sense for it to be that. This is quite the mystery and I'm excited to see what it is. Itll be here in 4 days.",

This is a piece of full sail lore right here. Wish the platform was more informative and organized so we didn't have to come to reddit for info.

I've seen videos from people in music and some say they're happy for the people they met and some of their expenses but for the money, they wish they went to a different (more traditional) school and did business and networking. I want to go but the money is steep and I don't know if I'm better off learning on my own and trying my hand or taking the risk and hoping I come out in good financial standing. Gotten stressed just playing my options ",

Just being able to be out of where of where I am now and doing what I enjoy will be motivation on itself. I'm just scared of paying so much and life offering nothing back. I almost want to teach myself and fail as I won't need go pay loans back but I will hate to miss out on the experience, especially since I've been trying to trying to attend to a few years now. \n\nI'm on the verge of wanting to back out but I don't want to let another year go by and be no where close than I would if I went.

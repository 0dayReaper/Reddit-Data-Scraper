From a students perspective, would you recommend attending the full sail? Or should she look elsewhere?",

This school will have a large focus on writing for entertainment (movies and tv) and also using editing software. If she just wants to write novels it may not be the best place.",

Some of the stuff I knew, but there were perspectives and other aspects of the industry that really helped me pivot and find something I love; but I think i value the connections/networking more than the courses by far. \n\nHowever, I do echo the other people saying to try something smaller/locally first. if she decides she hates it or it isn't for her she isn't 40k in the hole.",

If her goal is becoming an author, there isn't a whole lot that having a degree will do to help with that.\n\nAbsolutely she would learn helpful things in her classes, but those things can also be learned from workshops and one-off classes that will help her develop connections and a network of support (and possibly editors, agents, and publishers) locally. Becoming a published author is about making the right connections and, most importantly, writing. A lot of writing.\n\nThere is no substitute for writing. So in the end, your mom should do what is most going to get her to write a lot.",

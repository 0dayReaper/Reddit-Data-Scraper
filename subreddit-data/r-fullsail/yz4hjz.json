    "postText": "so I have been looking for apartments near fullsail as i intend to learn there next year but looking at the prices of nearby areas worry me because they all seem to expensive for one person to pay off. the apartments fullsail lists of their website go from around 1.5k to 2.5k in price. I would need to make 3x this amount per month to be able to live there which would make me have to make a total of 54k-90k a year as a minimum. i dont know if im missing something but it feels like it would be nearly impossible for me to earn that much as a uni student. any help would be nice",

Hopefully things will calm down next year, but I won't count on it unless some actual legislation is passed. A lot of grads that were originally going to stick around for a bit after their degree program are now trying to get out of their lease and back home where the COL is cheaper. \n\nThis all being said, there's been a whisper around campus that their *might* be some sort of housing solution for Full Sail students coming in the near future. Not sure whether they're planning on buying one of the nearby apartment neighborhoods or just striking a deal with them. Currently just a rumor though... It'd be smart of them to do considering COL here is a major barrier of entry for students who want to enroll. \n\nNext year, if you still plan on enrolling, call and ask to speak to the student housing department to see how they can assist.",

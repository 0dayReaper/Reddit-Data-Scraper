    "postText": "If anyone on here has taken it, what was the 3D Arts certificate like? I got my BA in Game Design, but it was a very general degree so there were only a few relatively beginner classes (like 2 on maya, 1 on zbrush, and 1 vfx for unreal engine,) so I ended up having to teach myself a lot (such as propper retopo for characters, substance painter/designer, etc.)\n\nI want to further my 3D knowledge so the certificate sounds nice, especially since it's from full sail,  but if it's mostly stuff I know already I hesitate. I don't mind a little reinforcement, but if 80% of it is recap I'd be quite upset lol.\n\nOn the other hand, I could take a few courses at a time on CGMA that have (seemingly) more variety/specialization, longer courses, and end up being more cost effective (course price per month) \ud83e\udd14 \n\nWhatever I choose it'd have to be online as I can't afford to move and pay tuition \ud83d\ude14",

Paid classes like cgma are okay but you can be much cheaper and still find education. I recomend 3d fast track discord channel by Dennis porter, it's a dollar a month and the pros there will help you on anything ur trying to learn. I've seen several students go from nothing to AAA pro on that server alone",

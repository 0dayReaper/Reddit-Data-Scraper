And then my second questions. I don\u2019t really know anyone in my program and I was wondering how can I network with other with being online.",

            "comment": "I'm a year in on computer animation. I recommend jumping on l your projects for the week immediately. Get it done, and get it out of the way. For every class. I tend to procrastinate, but I'm really only in it for the quick degree since I already know what I'm doing.... For the most part. XD\n\nThe networking part is pretty lame I'm not gonna lie. There is a discord for most classes, but nothing for the student body in general. I'm kind of surprised at how lacking rhey are in this area considering how hard they shove it down your throat.\n\nThe best favor you can do for yourself is to practice as much as you can outside of the assignments. Don't be afraid to learn on your own outside of the class work. As matter of fact I highly suggest you do.\n\nPut in the work, build a portfolio beyond the stuff you do in school, and try to make friends where you can. Online is pretty limited for that I know but it opens up once you get to 3D foundations and get to discord.",

That doesn't include internet, electric or renters insurance. Living on your own is even more expensive.\n\nIf a student doesn't pay their share of rent, you will get a notice on your door stating to pay or you'll be evicted. So I suggest you talk with potential roommates, ask FBI like questions.\n\nDuring the housing process all the roommates that will be signing your lease will send in your paystubs to the leasing agent that will help you sign for the complex. She'll add the paystubs and see if you reach the minimum requirement to live at the complex.\n\nIt's expensive to live in Orlando, it's like California more or less. Traffic is horrendous in the mornings if you dont live close, so you have to leave earlier if you live farther away. But closer to the school means rent will cost more, just depends how much of a good deal you can get.\n\nSo note, I say ask FBI like questions because some roommates don't have manners and will eat your food also. Causing you to you have lesser money each month.",

To start, that's a mess. Someone at one point will be cock-blocking each other if or when someone brings a date over. And if that doesn't cause drama enough, one person will be waking the other person up in the mornings. There are times where you have to be in class early and some classes are very late at night (the previous night class) where you just want to sleep in and relax.\n\nThis isn't the brightest idea. \n\nDo a 3 bedroom 2 bath (without having a 4th). If you really want 4 people, I suggest you look at house rentals rather than apartments since they will offer more bedrooms.\n\nNote: If you can't afford the living, I suggest you save up until you do then move to Orlando. You'll be stressed out between the roommates, trust me. \n\n&gt; just to make sure they can pay rent and they wont just up and leave out of the blue.\n\nNormally if someone leaves, they have to pay a hefty fine to break the lease (I think that includes paying the last month's rent so more or less paying double, on top of any fees). If 4 people are living together, I doubt they'll break the lease since they also don't have that kind of money to just leave randomly.",

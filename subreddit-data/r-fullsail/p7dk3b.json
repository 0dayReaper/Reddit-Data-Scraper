It sounds like an amazing school with great people attending. \n\nHowever when things seem this good theres usually some skeletons in the closet. \n\nWhat are some things I should know/consider before applying after I graduate.",

            "comment": "Full Sail is definitely a \"get back what you put in\" type of school. A lot of people see there accelerated schedules and think that they are quick and easy. This is not the case.\n\nFull Sail asks a lot, but they give a lot back. Most of the teachers are professionals in their respective fields and offer a lot of inside perspective. The courses are fast, and require complete attention to come out on top. They will expect you to do just as much outside research compared to the information they give you.\n\nNetworking side of things, on campus is much better. I have made friends and contacts being an online student, but of the people I know who attended the school before me, it's a much better experience in person.",

My program is a Bachelor's program so I need to take a college mathematics class, a business accounting class and learn marketing, audio and video production. I've learned a lot. Classes are tough but they will work with you through tutors. The Launch Box you get is a techie's dream. Full Sail also has a long history of their students getting jobs in their field almost six months after graduating. They even help you put together a portfolio to showcase your skills.",

My instructors were awesome and gave me interview tips and are even looking at the things I produce at work and are giving me tips to get better.\n\nI think the only con I\u2019ve noticed is that, because everyone is accepted, you do have classmates that don\u2019t even follow instructions or put their best effort into assignments. But if you put in 110%, you\u2019ll definitely find the degrees are worthwhile. \n\nOne of my coworkers was impressed that I\u2019m a Fullsail student.

It will start off relatively slow but once you get into month 4 or 5 of your program the classes will start to get long and there will be a lot more work to do. It is definitely possible to do it but it takes a lot of your time to get everything done",

It's not that it's a bad school, but is is A LOT of debt to take on as an 18 year old not knowing exactly what you want to do. You say you know, but chances are high that you will likely change you mind. This happened to me. I was definitely one of the better students in my class and very driven and disciplined, but when I graduated and actually started working in the industry, I realized I made a huge mistake. Take some time to really define who you are and what you truly want to do. This can take years and that is why a four year state school is so great. Get the first two years of gen eds out of the way and use that time to cultivate yourself, research the field that you want to go into, and understand where your talents will take you.",

If you aren't personally driven to maintain your skills you will graduate knowing next to nothing. \n\nAt your age I would look into a 4 year program that you can cultivate skills and cement them as second nature. This will also allow you to actually enjoy college and have a social life without taking away from your studies.",

            "comment": "Don't buy into the hype. As a former game art student, I recommend taking the time to find a school that better fits your needs.\n\nFor starters, and this is one you've probably heard already, it's a for profit school which means all they're looking to do is churn out students as quickly as possible. Classes run at any hour of the night (which means you may have a class at 9am or a class at 9pm, whenever) and they spin it as a way to get you ready for the industry when in reality it's because they won't spend the money to build enough labs and classrooms to house their student body.\n\nEducation-wise, I had some good teachers and I had some not so good teachers (see: fired for voyeurism or sleeping with students for good grades) but 90% of the curriculum boils down to you teaching yourself through provided podcasts, which you can do for a fraction of the price with sites like Udemy or even for free with youtube. Classes are also only a month long - accelerated degree after all and expect you to absorb a whole lot of information in a very short amount of time. If you can do that, golden if not then have fun repeating courses once or twice.\n\nAdministration is basically worthless at their jobs and will offer as little support as possible to students. I could basically only get answers when I had my parents call. Every other month I was in for scheduling conflicts which required a 1-2 hour wait in their student office.\n\nI won't get into the bloated tuition costs because every college rakes you over the coals for things you don't need but also keep in mind that if you are going to be on campus that there is no housing so you'll need to budget in an additional 1-2k a month for rent and as someone who lived in multiple complexes around Winter Park, it's not so nice. (Looking at you Gun Key)\n\nPerhaps all this has gotten better in the last 10 years but somehow I doubt it. If I could offer a bit of advice that I wish someone had given me; Find a school that offers degrees in computer sciences (or anything else you're interested in) and do that while building up a solid understanding of art/animation on your own. Self practice will make you a far better artist than any 6 figure \"university\" will and if you can get a real degree in something else then you'll be setting yourself up for success down the road.",

I can't say I would recommend it. Esp to someone young and without experience. Campus may be different but the online stuff is highly disorganized most of the time, and always inconsistent. As well I have come across a lot of very lazy teaching habbits. Its very clear they prioritize industry \"experience\" over teaching ability. They have yet to realize, or maybe even don't care that knowing something doesn't mean you know how to teach it.\n\nFor me it works okay bc I already know what I'm doing. I've been doing CG stuff for a long time as a hobby, but COVID forced an career change and I need the quick degree to even get looked at.\n\nAgain it's different for everyone and you can say that for just about any school. However FS is very expensive, and you should shop around first. My friend started an animation mentor knowing nothing and now works for Sony. She's been in the industry for about 2 years...ish.\n\nTake your time, and make a clean well thought out decision. Just make sure if you do choose Full Sail you are ready to go at it 1000% because a 100 is not enough. You'll have to do a lot of your own work on the side to really get what you need.",

No help, and the field they told me was flooded and oversaturated and that it was hard to find placement in.  It took me 10 years to pay for a degree that taught me almost nothing I didn't already know. Which was music production and audio engineering. For me, it was better off interning with a professional in the field rather than spending $65k. The teachers were mostly bad, and a lot of them barely spoke full sentences that made sense. I can't speak for in person at the actual campus, or other degrees, but I regret it a lot.",

As long as you can keep up, you should be okay.\n\nHowever, some teachers don't really help you. Besides doing this online, you're watching a 2 hour lecture or searching tutorials online for an easier solution.\n\nI'd say being halfway though my classes, the only concept I can't seem to wrap my head around is the animation part itself. Modeling and lighting is pretty simple to me, I absolutely love doing it. \n\nI will say Full Sail does give you a ton of scholarships if you get consistent good grades so it knocks your debt down a bit along with any financial aid added.",

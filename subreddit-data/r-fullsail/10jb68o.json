    "postText": "I'm passionate about game development and was wondering if the tuition, the course, and the degree are worth it. I've gone to different places looking for answers, and many say that game design is not a good choice, as it pays awful, and it is not in demand, but that game programming/development was a better choice, since they get paid better and better work environments + programming experience.",

It took about a decade to pay off the loans, but was manageable. \n\nDirectly in terms of job opportunities, there are simply more entry engineering jobs accessible to external candidates than designers. I\u2019m there is also nothing stopping you from also pursing technical designer or designer roles with a programming degree. \n\nHappy to talk more about my personal journey here if it helps, but I don\u2019t regret attending and wouldn\u2019t change a thing.",

You'd have to test to get into game dev.\n\nThe issue I have with game design is there are way too many people studying it and to be competitive in the marketplace you're going to need to have strong technical ability, especially as someone right out of school.\n\nAlso game development skills will heavily apply to many jobs outside of game development.",

Meanwhile the entire company only hired   around 2 dozen junior designers last year.",

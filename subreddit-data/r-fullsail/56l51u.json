    "postText": "So I would love to attend Full Sail, Bachelors in Music Production. I understand its going to be expensive. But I will be receiving VA benefits while attending (if I do attend) as well as Financial Aid if it's available. Thats actually what I wanted to know is what Financial Aid options are there and what is the likelihood of my actual acceptance. I'm genuinely interested in attending and want music production or audio engineering to be my career. Music is my passion. But I want to know all the ins and outs of the admissions process beforehand.",

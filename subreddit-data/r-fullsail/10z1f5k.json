If you book a room it's yours for the timeslot, if nobody has booked it then of course they let people in there).\n\nYou can book many of the studios but good luck. I had to pull massive strings to get into a recording studio for an hour, simply because they're booked wall to wall. Technically speaking you're allowed to use any of the facilities except the medical research centres (for legal reasons), but it's an active campus with classes throughout most business hours so, it's tough to get in.",

    "postText": "Hello! Thank you for taking the time to help me and hopefully some others out!\n\nTo preface this, I have done my Reddit research and I\u2019m not finding a lot of information that pertains to my interest in FSU so I\u2019m looking to hopefully get some feedback from  anyone in the Web Dev degree and also from those that are current/recent students that have any useful input. \n\nIf you\u2019re a graduate in this degree or similar, I\u2019d also love to hear your feedback on how it\u2019s affected your career and what impact your degree at FSU has had wether it\u2019s the employer outlook on FSU when you\u2019ve applied, or the knowledge you took with you and applied. \n\nFor context: \n\nI have an AS from a community college that was basically all IT classes. \n\nI have a couple years at a university that I learned some programming languages and web design from. \n\nI moved back to my home state and there are no local colleges near me that offer anything I\u2019m interested in and I\u2019ve been looking into doing a fully online BS to finish my degree and school in general I hope. If I ever have to look at canvas or another college site again after this until I have kids old enough, it\u2019ll be too soon lmao. \n\nI\u2019m interested in Web Development, App Development, Full-Stack engineering in general (not sure if I want to do full-stack in the future or stick to niche areas) \n\nThe Questions:\n\n1. Is the Web Dev BS worth more than the paper it\u2019s printed on? I know they\u2019re accredited but do employers love or shun FSU on average since it\u2019s not (insert Ivy League here). \n\n2. Are the fully online degrees as good as they make it sound when talking with admissions? Are there any negatives to doing a fully online degree here? \n\n3. What makes FSU better than WGU or Kent State? I say these because when trying to find web dev and programming degrees fully online, these three are really the best ones I could find. If you think one of the others is better, let me know why!\n\n4. I was told there is a really good tutoring system at FSU and I\u2019m skeptical. The reason I\u2019m asking is because I\u2019m used to being at colleges that either didn\u2019t have tutoring, or they really only covered core subjects like math. \n\n5. How much time does someone with decent skill and work ethic typically dedicate per week in this degree online? I\u2019m willing to work hard and get it done to the best I can, I\u2019m just curious on if it\u2019s a ridiculous amount as I work a full time job m-f but I work from home so it shouldn\u2019t affect a ton as I can work on my assignments during work hours sometimes too. \n\n6. How are the professors you\u2019ve had in this degree program? I know it\u2019s different per professor but if this degree has a bunch of lazy unhelpful professors, that would obviously be a red flag lol. \n\n7. Am I limited by this degree in what I can do in my career? I\u2019ll always be learning externally about new things and will keep up to date throughout my career but I guess I\u2019m asking if this is strictly a Website creation and management degree or will a lot of this translate to any other development opportunities? \n\n8. How did it go for those that had transfer credits? Did you have a lot of issues transferring classes over or were they pretty good about it?\n\n9. What does a normal week look like with classes and assignments? I know it\u2019s typically one month of two classes each month boot camp style is pretty much all I know. \n\n10. How do you normally pass the class? Is it typically a project, exam, certification test, etc. \n\nAgain, thank you so much if you made it here and have any info that can help me with my decision! I\u2019m very grateful as I\u2019m stressing trying to decide where to go lol.",

            "comment": "To be blunt it is not better than WGU or Kent State. The school is terrible, the professors are clueless, and there is no tutoring system. Everything that you are told by the people that constantly call you before you go are lying to you. Once you get there you learn very quickly that you were lied to and are getting practically scammed. Please save yourself the time and money and stay FAR AWAY from Full Sail.",

You probably can\u2019t tell me what\u2019s on page one of your enrollment agreement. It\u2019s all there. \n\nTo the OP. Your questions have been asked a million times about FS. Here is the short answer. You get in what you put into it, and that goes for any school you go to. FS has been wonderful to me and my career, and I highly recommend the education.",

I guess I was looking for more information about the web dev degree in particular pertaining to the questions so it would be a bit more specific and not just FSU general or about the all great media production degrees that I know are solid from what I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019m just worried about the degree being more of a side note for the college and not be as well done and supported as the others that are",

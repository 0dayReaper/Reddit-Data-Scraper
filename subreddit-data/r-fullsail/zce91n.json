            "comment": "Copying my answer to this from a previous thread asking about the MacBook:\n\n&gt;No one is going to be able to tell you which exact model you'll receive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Full Sail has a contract with each of their equipment providers, the school receives a certain number of each item based on predicted enrollment numbers. How frequently they get shipments is the primary determination of the model is.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Are you going to receive a laptop that the school received 12 months ago, 6 months ago, or last week? None of us can tell you that. But there is a very good chance that your laptop and iPad will be either the current generation or the one prior.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It also depends on your degree program. Game design and I believe a couple other programs don't receive MacBooks, they get laptops running Windows. For a time, the film students got MacBooks with larger screens than the creative writing students.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If you're starting at the end of this month, you won't receive your MacBook until next year (around month 5 of your program), and it's impossible for anyone here to know which MacBooks will be in stock at the school's shipping center at that time.",

Someone who started more recently may be able to tell you if Full Sail is doing M2s yet.\n\nIf you are doing the Mobile specialization the Pixel will be for device testing applications in the Google Programming Language block. Android Studio has a built in emulator, but it can be pretty slow and nothing beats testing on an actual device.",

    "postText": "I am in Game Development currently at a community college, and I am about to start my last semester. I have core classes like algebra, statistics, trig, english 1, english 2, history 1, history 2, biology 1, speech, art, learning framework, and any more I may be forgetting completed and done with. I love game development, and I find myself wanting more work to do than what my professors currently assign, and I constantly work on personal projects. I love game development, and I am looking for somewhere to extend my associates to a bachelors, and I know FullSail is Nationally accredited, but I assume the vast majority of online schools are the same. For personal reason, attending in person classes are off the table for me, so it is either an online school with a \"half ass\" bachelors, like the stereotypes suggest, or I just stick with my associates. I am not really the type of learner to watch youtube videos and try to understand what is going on, I have always needed guidance from someone to help me completely understand. Also, my hour wise would be 100% all day everyday dedicated to full sail if I decide to attend.   \n\n\nfrom someone who may have been to FullSail or someone who may have any suggestive information, should I transfer, or just keep my associates, and why?",

            "comment": "Do not go to fullsail. please avoid it. I am currently at my midterm of Bach in game development online. Going off what you said not the type to watch YouTube videos. I can tell you 100 percent the teachers will not show or teach you anything of value that you would think. They mite do a online session but guess what its in the middle of the day when most people work and they don't record them. In short for midterm I have guys that don't even know how to use animator getting 90's for there midterm. Don't go to this school you are welcome to DM me any questions you have my only goal here is to share what you would not know until you are to far along. Full sail game development is a joke I've taught my self more in a month about game development then almost a years of being at this school. Please just don't look at the stupid commercial or wonderful webpage and expect it to be the same its meant to draw you in. My first degree cost me 26k and full sail is costing me 56k and my first school at least did a decent job for 26k but for 56k lol its so sad how bad it is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorst thing Ive seen so far is I had a guy do nothing for midterm and pass with high 90 because others did the work. If you want the easiest school that will not challenge you at all then full sail is great but if you want teachers teaching you then this school is not it you will live on YouTube and end up getting your degree because of YouTube. Trying to keep this short DM me if you have specific questions. If I knew then what I know now 100 percent not worth it and would of never started.",

However, I will say after talking to other game developers from naughty dog and no moon they both really care about your talents and history, like it looks good to have a bachelor's and internships but really its your talents that matters so if you have the history and the talent  requirements they need from you stick with your associates and apply. If anything if you don't like full sail go to laguna beach of art and design online they are pretty good, you will have to submit a portfolio though and I believe it's 12 submissions. If I were you, I would stick with your associates and keep practicing it'll save you money and give you more opportunities to build up your resume.",

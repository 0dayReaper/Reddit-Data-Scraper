Because it\u2019s online school they know they can\u2019t expect you to be able to attend video calls when they give them because everyone has work schedules and some people are in different time zones. Most of the video calls are saved online after the live session for you to watch when it\u2019s convenient for you! Log in as soon as possible so you don\u2019t miss any assignments due soon though! Check those due dates!",

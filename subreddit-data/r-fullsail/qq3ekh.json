I've always been interested in the school and its program but the tuition is a bit overwhelming. Is it worth the money or are there better alternatives elsewhere?",

I am talking to a few students 15+ months in and they are scraping by it\u2019s so hard. Full Sail gives you the tools you need to succeed. It\u2019s not going to babysit you and try to make sure you do your work. It expects you to try things at yourself and fail so you can understand. A lot of trial by fire.",

As someone who's been to community College in school and online, then went to scad, im telling you right now full sail is pretty good and ten times better than scad. They give you the tools to succeed and like most universities you will start off with easier classes and proceed to get harder. However, even though it gets harder, they will give you opportunities to get ahead of the game, for example as a creative writer each class give us magazines to submit our work in and hopefully we'll get accepted. Amd if you're a military brat or veteran your benefits will not go to waste. If anything If you don't like full sail I say go to laguna beach of art and design that college is amazing , however you will have to submit a portfolio.",

Can't speak for the coding aspect cause I was never really good at that and it wasn't my chosen specialty, but I can tell you for what I went for it was a tremendous waste of time and money. The school preaches that they care about your future but I can promise you all they care about is your money so they can spread their campus like a virus.",

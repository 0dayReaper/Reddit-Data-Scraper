    "postText": "I wish Full Sail had some tradition. I talk to my friends at other colleges they seem to have a lot more history to them than Full Sail. I know it's a young school, but i feel there has been enough time to get something for students to do together other then networking events. I feel like there is just no camaraderie between degree programs in the school and no way for older students to relate to newer students. Is there possibly something I am missing? Is there a part of campus life that I have yet to be told about? Any alumni who have recomendations for new students?",

            "comment": "Universities have a history for three reasons:\nA) Location- the area in which they abide is historically rich/their campuses have been around for quite some time\nB) Research: This is what makes a University, a University. Yknow all those articles you see like \"So-and so university blah blah...\" Yep. Thats history right there, and it's also why a place is called a University in the first place.\nC) Organizations: Like clubs, but more beneficial to the surrounding area(volunteer work). Your friends probably have Orgs at their Uni's. This too makes a University a University.\nAs was said earlier I think(?) Full Sail has a history as a vocational school(FS Real World Education/Workshop), It wont be like a University' history.",

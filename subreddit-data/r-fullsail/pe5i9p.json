    "postText": "Hi, new here. I was hoping for some input or some advice on retaking classes. I'm online and I'm doing the Mobile Development degree. I'm a little bit over a year in. For some of the easier classes I crush them and move on quickly however once in a while there's been a class that kicks my ass and I'm forced to retake it. Currently going to have to retake Interface Programming for the 3rd time next month since it feels like there's too much content for a single month to learn.\n\nI was wondering if having to retake classes is a common thing or am I just doing really bad in some of my classes. I guess I'm wondering if I'm not alone.",

Especially when you're in the later classes in a degree it's common to not grasp all of the content on the first go, and that's fine.\n\nBe sure to utilize the resources you have in front of you *and* reach out to your instructor and lab instructors whenever something isn't clear. Make the most of your time, don't sit around and spiral on the same issue without asking for help or doing some more research. So long as you are doing your best, *truly*, then you're fine.\n\nWhat you *don't* want to do is repeat a class and make the same mistakes, have the same hangups, etc. The resubmission policy is really forgiving nowadays as well so that helps, certainly.",

I  had some people drop after finding the first couple of classes in game dev to be challenging. . I cant find the your current class on the website so I am not sure where you are exactly in your degree.",

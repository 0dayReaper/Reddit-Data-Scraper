    "postText": "Hey all. Just had some questions regarding the Sportscasting degree at Full Sail. I\u2019ve left the golf and sales industry to pursue radio broadcasting and I\u2019m curious as to anyone else\u2019s experience in the program, especially how it compares to the BS in media communications. While I\u2019m not necessarily as passionate on the sports side of the industry it seems as though the sportscasting degree might be more relevant to radio broadcasting training than the media communications degree. However I can definitely see the benefits of understanding the marketing side of broadcasting on a deeper level. My goal is to make the right choice to put me on a path to a career I enjoy so any experienced full sail student feedback in this area would be greatly appreciated! Thanks :)",

            "comment": "Hey! So I'm currently in the 16th months of the sportscasting degree. I'd say the program is what you make of it, and if you put in a lot of effort you will learn a lot from the program. I was supposed to be on campus but COVID ruined those plans and at this point I continued to stay online. The project launchbox you get as a student really helps you complete assignments more professionally at home, however I will say that there are a lot of resources for on campus sportscasting students that you miss out on if you are online. I also was more interested in the broadcasting aspects when I applied vs. the sports side (while I am a sports fan so it doesn't bother me), and I will say a lot of the classes you will take for the program are very sports oriented. From my understanding of the media communications degree, you do a decent amount of audio and video production stuff, but the sportscasting degree goes a lot more in depth and you work on this stuff a lot more frequently. And you have other classes like \"Vocal Training for Sportscasting\" that would probably be up your alley being that you want to get into radio broadcasting. \n\nTo sum things up, if you know for certain you want to be a radio broadcaster, and are committed to putting in a lot of effort in school, I'd say go for it. But if you aren't 100 percent sure, I would probably do more research and make sure this is an avenue you want to go down. Full Sail is expensive, and from my understanding the classes you take wont transfer over to other colleges and/or programs. Once you get past like month two or three at Full Sail, the classes you start to take won't even transfer over to other degree programs they offer being that your curriculum very specific to your program(at least for sportscasting). Hope this helped!",

I know you might not be there yet but I\u2019m just wondering how the career readiness aspect of the program is looking from your point of view. Bummer about Covid! That has to be frustrating especially in a hands on type of major like this one seems to be. If you don\u2019t mind me asking are you working as well during your time at Full Sail and if so is it a manageable schedule? Thanks again!",

                            "comment": "Of course! So from my experience so far with job placement, they have some whole department at Full Sail where career advisors are supposed to help you find a job. I'll be honest, I haven't worked with my advisor a whole lot. They put you in some sort of job searching device like indeed and you'll get emails periodically with job/internship programs related to what you are studying. So from my assessment, full sail career advising is similar to any other universities career advising office. \n\nHowever, Full Sail is really big on networking. All of my teachers I've got have a lot of industry experience. I am sure if you work hard and build a relationship with your professor, they will be able to point you in the right direction or even put in a good word for you at a job. I've had teachers sometimes tell us about job opportunities they've heard about too which is pretty neat. At the end of the day, getting a job in sportscasting is all about experience and Full Sail will give you that. So kind of going off what I said earlier, Full Sail definitely does help with finding a job but it wont fall on your lap you gotta put in effort and do stuff outside of class like networking and such to get an opportunity. My teachers have told me before that ESPN loves to hire Full Sail students but idk how true that is or if they were just hyping stuff up.\n\nSo I've been working on and off since I got to Full Sail. In regards to being an online student, having a job and school is definitely do able. Most of the time I have one assignment due wednesday and one sunday. Sometimes you may have one or two more assignments in a week but normally its just two. And you don't have to go to the live lectures, you can just watch the recording and write like a 4 sentence paragraph on what you learned. They make it really flexible(at least online), and there are a lot of adults in my classes with full time jobs and other responsibilities like children. There have been even some active duty military members in my classes too. As for on campus, I can't answer in that regard but I am sure it's a little more time consuming than being online. I've heard through the grapevine that some employers near Winter Park don't hire Full Sail Students campus because their schedules are so time consuming and constantly changing. But idk how true that is. So I guess it depends if you do online or on campus.",

However I know a handful of my on campus classmates have gotten jobs since they graduated. One of my friends/classmates that is still in the program actually got a paid internship through one of the sportscasting staff members at school and he has done some pretty cool production stuff through that. I actually moved down to Winter Park 6 months ago and took some on campus courses. If you really want to do sports broadcasting this is the place to be but it is a HUGE commitment, you have to put in work outside of school/homework to succeed and stand out to employers.",

Could you explain a bit in detail the type of effort you have to put in outside of school/hw? Im all for putting in the most I can to get the most out of it I was just curious on how you really \u201cget yourself out there\u201d especially someones whos just entering a new area. Thanks for taking the time to share your experience w this program btw it helps out a ton more than any college article explaining the programs details",

I could go on for days, but needless to say Full Sail and this program exceeded my expectations and then some. You don't even need to know entirely what you want to do. If you know 100% you want to be in this field, this is the right place for you. But this is not a school to come to if you are not full committed to putting the work in, because it is expensive and I believe credits from here won't transfer to many other schools (could be wrong about the last part)\n\nI see a lot of people hate on this school. And it definitely is not like the normal university. So keep that in mind especially if you are straight out of high school. For me I didn't care cause I was a transfer student and already had the big school/party experience. But if you are willing to put in the work, you will be in a great position to succeed upon graduation. A lot of people come here and think this place is going to hand them a job-that is not the case-put in the work and you will be happy with the investment you made!\n\nI am 2 weeks away from graduation, and looking back on it I am so glad I attended Full Sail. I do not want to get into too much personal information, but to summarize Full Sail has helped me achieve professional goals I never thought I could achieve.",

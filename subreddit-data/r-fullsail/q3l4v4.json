I'd prefer to know some people outside my course that I wouldn't have met otherwise, if that sounds good to anyone just leave a comment cause I'm down to hang w people from Reddit; not too scared of that kinda stuff. \nI turned 20 not too long ago but I'm not too bothered about peoples ages either.",

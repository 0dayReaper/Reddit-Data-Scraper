You won\u2019t be going crazy with coding but you do learn about scripting mechanics and engine basics with Unity. Game development is more focused on creating Coding and could be almost considered a Software Engineer lots of coding and building engines from the ground up.",

If not, what is it you want as a career?\n\nIf so, it doesn\u2019t really matter which you pick, but you\u2019re going to need to learn some coding outside of game design. \n\nGame Development will turn you out as a programmer. Design, won\u2019t. The scripting you in design is not focused on C#. It\u2019s visual scripting as I understand.",

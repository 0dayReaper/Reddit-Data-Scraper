    "postText": "Hello everyone. I have a question but wanted to ask here before I apply for any classes basically I was homeschooled when I was younger and ended up getting my ged back in 2013.\n\nI have wanted to start college for a while now for game design and have been wondering how all of this works I know I should probably know all this but as I said I was homeschooled and they dident go over anything related to college.\n\nIv been trying to find start dates but everything I seen on the site are for this year I\u2019m assuming it has a start date for most of the classes but I\u2019m honestly probably just missing it .\n\nAlso I\u2019m curious about how online classes actually work is it like login to you pc and whatever time and do the classes that way or is it like pre recorded videos I prefer to be able to talk with the instructors and such helps me understand. Iv tried online classes like the free havard stuff on the internet and can\u2019t stand the pre recorded videos\u2026\n\nI will most likely have more questions btw lol.",

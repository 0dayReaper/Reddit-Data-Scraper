            "comment": "Unfortunately, Full Sail is not regionally accredited, which is universally accepted when transferring to other schools and employers. Yeah, I went back to school at a state university and got my computer science degree from there. Life was much better after that, but no, none of my credits transferred from Full Sail. Had to get my bachelors from the state university instead.",

    "postText": "So when I started, the website still showed the MacBook Pro, but said some programs would be getting the HP. Now the website has updated to HP Zbook. I'm scheduled to have my Launchbox shipped next week, and was just curious what to expect. Also, what are the basic specs of the computer? Processor, storage, RAM, etc? Thanks!",

They told me that I would be getting the MacBook and that the HP is only going to people that enrolled after March. But the interesting thing imo is that the listing that said MacBook also said iPad Mini and I received a standard iPad which is in the HP listing. So tbh I still have no clue what I\u2019m getting.

And I would be more comfortable with the ZBook but I\u2019m kinda hoping for the MacBook because I\u2019d like to have access to that platform in a better fashion than mobile. But yeah we just gotta wait and see. ",

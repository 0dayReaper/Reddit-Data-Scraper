    "postText": "So, I believe I\u2019m ready to go to college for graphic design next year, but I\u2019m not sure where to start...\n\nFirstly, I have no money saved up, so I\u2019m not even sure if Full Sail is an option, but I\u2019ve applied and looked at the school and it seems legit. However, I\u2019ve seen some people mention some negative things about it and it\u2019s debt. Is there a better, more affordable school I can go to for Graphic design? I live in Kansas City, Missouri if that helps.",

            "comment": "I started my first class in GD and it\u2019s pretty straightforward. For financial aid, I have no money at all for school and I got approved for Pell grant, Federal loans because of low income and the Momentum Scholarship paid for anything else. I chose the Launchbox so my total for tuition is about 55k but the momentum pays for what my loans won\u2019t, up to 25k during my enrollment. \nI love that I can be done with a class in a month. My first class is going swell and I have an A. Project was due immediately but nothing too crazy. Just keep up with your messages and notifications. The software isn\u2019t the most intuitive but it\u2019s not the worst. I was at a traditional 4 year and I hated how the class dragged and the student login pages were outdated. Good luck!",

Kinda wack but the classes are pretty interesting and entertaining so I'm not totally hating it so far. Professors have been lots of help too. Not sure when I'll get my launchbox now since I started later but I know I should get my MacBook by my next class.",

You will accumulate TONS of debt unnecessarily. If you live in KC, you should check Fort Hays State University, in Hays, KS. They have an EXCELLENT, well-respected program. I have many friends who went there and now work at top Ad agencies around the country. It'll cost a fraction of Full Sail, even if it is out of state. Do yourself a favor and check it out. I made the mistake of going to Full Sail and never wish I had.",

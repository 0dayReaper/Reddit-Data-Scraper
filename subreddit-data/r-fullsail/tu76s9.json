    "postText": "Hey, so I wrote a short film last month that I actually really loved writing and though it fits the submission guidelines for the Film department, it feels more like it should be animated. So I was wondering if anyone in the Computer Animation program or graduates would be interested in doing it as a potential side project or for their portfolio. \n\nLet me know! I'd love to work with someone outside of just my degree fields.",

It's kind of mind blowing. I'll never forget the Project and Portfolio instructor who said \"it doesn't matter cus this none of this stuff will be in your portfolio anyway\". I  wanted to loose my sh*t when he said that.",

    "postText": "I love drawing and creating characters and places(concept art). I'm a gamer and been looking for a future in that industry. I get very exited over the idea of actually being taught how to draw certain things with certain styles. I heard FullSail is an amazing university that has graduated many game Devs as well as game designers. In fact, six graduates from FullSail were game Devs for the awesome viral game Destiny. I then realized its $80,000 to go to school there... I know they probably have scholarships for portfolios and stuff like that( which I have been working on my portfolio), and they also want 3D modeling such as sculptures. I would be able to do such things with software but I don't have a functioning computer nor an acceptable way of physically make a sculpture from clay and kiln. I don't know what I should work on, and I don't know what I am supposed to do to get accepted or even apply. Can I get some help? I want this.",

            "comment": "Hey there! I'm currently enrolled in the Online Game Art program and am 8 months in. For the first few months it's all pre-requisite courses, so all you need is a computer with stable internet to get the work done. The great thing about this program (and a vast majority of other programs offered by this school) is their Project Launchbox benefit. You are sent (and tacked on to tuition) a Macbook Pro with all of the programs you'll need to succeed while in school. For the amount of software, hardware, and art supplies you're sent, you're actually saving money by going this route.\n\nAs far as Finances go, APPLY FOR THE FAFSA. My Fafsa covered my first \"year\" and a vast majority of the second \"year\" (a 'year' by Full Sail standards is 8 months. It's a 32 month program, so it's still a '4 year' program). While it may cover it completely or partially, they do still offer scholarships and urge you to seek funding elsewhere (State grants, research other scholarships out there, too!). They are on top of every aspect of making sure you succeed there.\n\nIf you don't happen to have a working computer to complete the first few months, you may be in trouble. If you have one that you could use from a family member or friend, they still don't consider that as a \"reliable\" form of connecting to the school's browser, but if that's what you need to do then do it! \n\n8 months in, I still think it's worth it. There are some assignments that seem redundant and some teachers that seem a little removed from the situation, but if you just speak up and ask for help or advice they're more than willing to lend a hand. They don't want you to fail and have to retake the course. They want you to move forward and get one step closer to graduation and moving on to a career. \n\nIf it's something you really want to do, then commit to it. Go on to their website, request information about whatever program you're interested in, and then you'll be connected with someone from Admissions. They'll walk you through what you need to do to full apply and get accepted. \n\nSorry if this is super long, I just want to give you as much info as possible! Good luck!",

Which can also allow me to get scholarships... Also, I'd rather have a new stationary computer than MacBook. I have never tried actual computer art,as I like a pencil. I actually want to be able to get a job at a video game company to help assist in making or creating concept art(characters, environments, weapons, ect. ",

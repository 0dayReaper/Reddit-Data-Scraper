I've recently completed formal VO training in NYC and was hoping to work on some student projects.  Is there a bulletin board at the school or is talent primarily in house there?\n\nThanks",

Only due to the fact it's free and the school, if your game does well through out the classes, holds ALL rights to it. Outside of school, I could not tell you. Most I went to school with here are not anywhere close to their degree job.",

I'm assuming they will arrive just before the course on those particular coding languages.  After the courses are over, are these devices also for keeps?",

It's just really tiring having to do the reading that I actually skip a lot of it.",

I have a 4.0 right now mainly because the classes have been pretty easy for me so far. *knock on wood* \nAll you really have to do is read the instructions and complete them to the best of your ability and learn from your mistakes.\n\nWhen I've actually had to message an instructor, they're pretty reasonable about getting back to me within 24 hours. \n\nAs far as instruction, you'll have a list of assignments for the whole course that unlock as the weeks go by. It's usually either reading assignments or a test. There's some discussion posts in almost every class except for College Math. Due dates start out every Sunday (Week starts on Monday) and then a couple months in they have some assignments due Wednesday (like your initial discussion post about XYZ) and then you have until Sunday to respond to something like 3 of your peers.\n\nThere are usually weekly Webinars (in Math there were 2 or 3 a week) which are usually optional in that you don't have to attend live if you can't make it, but there's usually a recording. I highly recommend making time if possible to attend the webinar because you can ask whatever questions you need.\n\nPersonally, I'm getting a lot out of my courses. But again, I'm only in Month 7. Even with maxing out federal loans, I may have to pay out of pocket for another couple grand. I've already started though and I'll be damned if I quit school again. ",

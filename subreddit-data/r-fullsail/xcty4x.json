    "postText": "Hi, I am interested in tge Music production program at FS but I don't have the money to apy for it on my own. I spoke with admissions and they sent told me I could get up to $21,000 on scholarships since I am an international student. I also have a college insurance that will provide about $5,000 dollars a year, and the total price of the degree is at $92,000 right now. Does anyone in a similar situation have any helpful advice?",

            "comment": "You need to consider the fact as an International Student you are not allowed to work AT ALL unless it\u2019s with the school, and as far as I am aware the only opportunity is as a BTS tour guide which happens once per month. With the exception of the occasional need for extra hands at events. You won\u2019t get housing as they don\u2019t offer it, or a meal plan. So the degree itself isn\u2019t the only cost. \n\nYou\u2019d be better served either pursuing their online degree, (I got my BS in music production online, and did my MS on-campus), or find an alternative. \n\nI work in the industry and have for some time, but I can say with certainty that while I enjoyed both of my degrees and learned a lot. I did more with my own connections and efforts than what I got from Full Sail.",

            "comment": "There are other schools that offer this degree. Full Sail is a for profit school and they really only care about the money. I suggest that you apply to a regionally accredited school. You will have a longer time frame to work and learn. Full sail seems fast but you still have to digest the same amount of information as a 4year. Also, you would save money if you went to a regionally accredited school. Not to mention, all of your credits would transfer in the future. I\u2019m in that program currently, I have  a few months to go. I promise, it\u2019s smokes and mirrors, don\u2019t go. A wise person learns from the mistake of others, a fool repeats them. You\u2019ve been warned.",

My state college is very close in price to what my degree will cost throigh Full Sail. My state college is about 19k per year including books and all, and this doesn't include summer, this is based in 3 terms. If you include summer, it would be probably 3k to 4k more, as they are short and accurate classes. So if ypu truly compare, it's probably closer to 22k to be full time, like st Full Sail. \n\nNow, x that by 3, assuming 3 years of summer is enough to cut a year off. 66k is still more then my degree will cost, and it's slower. This is all kn campus too, so you have to factor in travel costs and time. Doing it online saves you gas, and travel time. Your difficulty will be worh financial aid I think. You can always apply and see what you qualify for. It never hurts to try.",

            "comment": "You should definitely apply to a different school. Or maybe an associates degree instead. If you go to full sail to study this degree you gotta know that the first few classes and months aren\u2019t important or helpful. By the time you start getting into real stuff you will be out of money and they will take you out of classes to say \u201chey we need you to pay or otherwise we are kicking you out next week\u201d. To be honest, I think there\u2019s many other ways to spend money and learn. The scholarships at full sail are truth, but they don\u2019t cover shit you still have to pay so much. Also, the vast majority of students are rich kids specially the international ones. It\u2019s hard to adapt if you don\u2019t come from a wealthy family.",

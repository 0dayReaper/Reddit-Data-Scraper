    "postText": "Hello guys, \n\nI am interested in doing the computer science program with hopes of moving into software engineering. I am already employed but I want to make a career change so I will be studying online.\n\nI wanted to ask what people\u2019s experience was with this course. Any regrets? Weak areas? Is this better than a coding bootcamp? Have employers respected your degree? Etc.\n\nAlso, for fullsail online, how time friendly are the courses? Like weekly hour input required.",

            "comment": "I'll start this by saying that I am currently a Computer Science student at Full Sail and I am attending Online.\n\nFull Sail is a good school. The knowledge and resources available here are designed to get you immediately into the workforce. The content is constantly updated to conform with the newest standards in the industry. \n\nThat being said, it is damn near a full time job. You need to commit to this 100%. The first 4 months are designed to get you used to how the school operates its Online format. After that, they expect a fair amount from you. I am currently at the end of Month 7, Programming 2, and they expect anywhere from 15-25 hours A WEEK from you. It is possible to accomplish this while working a full time job, I am doing it, but you have to have solid time management and study habits. They will provide the resources and tools you need to succeed, but it is up to you to use them. The instructors are amazing, however their time is limited for Online students, and if you miss the scheduled Lab time the only thing you can do is watch the recording and hope somebody asked the same question you had. \n\nHope this helps, and good luck making your decision! Feel free to ask any other questions and I'll do my best to answer them.",

I was debating CS and Web Dev. Mainly my interest are geared toward programming and development so ultimately I went Web Dev. (I still get my fix of code love languages :p) \n\nI firmly believe that Full Sail will help me further develop key attributes that I will be able to use in my day to day operations. This will lead to countless new opportunities in and out of my work space. Lastly, the personal achievement of obtaining a degree in my field paired with the prospect of sustainable growth for my family is priceless.\n\nFSU is NOT for everyone. This is a year round school dedicated to giving you the tools and resources you need... and nothing you don\u2019t. so you can get into the field and start prospering. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve noticed is that those who give the school the most hate are those who cannot apply themselves to an fast pace format. They are more traditional four year \u201cslower paced\u201d folks and there is nothing wrong with that. \n\nWhat you have to understand is this is a \u201cfor profit\u201d school, and you\u2019ll hear that quite often in your research. Does that make them bad? Not at all. Does that make them more expensive? Well that depends on who you compare them against. Often this is peoples biggest issue.. \u201cthey are expensive\u201d. \n\nFor me, the price was right. The timeframe was right. The framework on how they address the curriculum was right.  \n\nIt\u2019s fully accredited (nationally ) so if you want to start here, finish here. Unless you go to another nationally accredited school. \n\n(Both national and regional are the biggest standards, this is what employers look for from the school.. not just the name) (but they break things down a bit different, so do your research is this is important to you). \n\nThe difference between Full sail, and places like The university of Phoenix / DeVry is that FSU really puts their money where their mouth is. There is a reason they hype up their alumni and make damn sure you know that they\u2019ll empower you just the same. \n\nPhoenix and DeVry have horrible reviews on Niche (a respectable college forum/site) as where you can compare FSU to colleges like BGSU, OSU with a similar rating and review. My local universities. It\u2019s important to know that FSU is far from a \u201cdiploma mill\u201d. If you don\u2019t do well, you will fail. The support and communication thus far has been exceptional. Others will say the same. However with every situation there comes uniqueness. Just keep in mind... that generally speaking people are more likely to leave a bad review and complain... rather than a good review if they are satisfied. This applies to literally everything. \n\nLook, all of this is meaningless unless you find the value for YOU. I think you\u2019ll enjoy how things are broken down. I can\u2019t speak too much further than what I\u2019ve said now because I just started classes myself. I\u2019m rather enjoying everything and that\u2019s just my opinion. \n\nBest wishes!",

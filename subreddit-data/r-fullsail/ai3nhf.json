    "postText": "I am considering attending online for the Digital Cinematography program. I am just curious about the workload as I am active duty, married, and I have a small child. I'm not too concerned about doing class work every night, especially in the beginning, but I am wondering about the core classes that require things like casting. Is the work difficult to complete with only a certain amount of time in the week? What happens if I can't find people to cast or there are scheduling conflicts?  I appreciate any feedback about the program.",

            "comment": "Former full sail student and former active duty here.\n\nI attended Full Sail in person. If you are doing it in person, your leadership needs to basically kiss you goodbye. When I went through the program, some classes were at 2am, some were at 4pm. The schedule changed every month.\n\nI was hit by a car on the corner of university and Semoran. I had police reports, medical records, etc. The school dropped me because I went to physical therapy.\n\nThat's the kind of school you're dealing with. A hundred k of debt and homeless for 2 years because they don't care about their students. Now i can't get security clearance and my military life was made worse on their account. \n\nI know you'll go online, so imagine if I had that situation how forgiving they'll be for a random deployment or extended field exercise because some good idea fairy wants more bullets on their OER. You'll be screwed. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the info is exceptional in some programs like yours, but going online for cinematography is not a wise path. The bake for them is when you are local. When you have access to the sets and the lights and the rigs and the cameras.\n\nI'll echo what everyone else said. Reconsider.\nDon't ever go to a school that isn't regionally accredited unless it's the final stop for you. There are film majors at nearly every school across the country. Save your TA and get something transferable in case you can't finish.\n\nIf you really want to go, save your GI Bill for it. You won't have debt out the asshole, you'll be able to afford it without debt and will be able to really get experience with the program and get yourself a nice reel (which is much more valuable than a sheet of paper from them).\n\nI'm not saying run, just reevaluate.\nPM if you have any q's.",

Let's all remember a few things here:\n\na) Full Sail is a FOR PROFT school \n\nb) It is not accredited\n\nc) Full Sail is a diploma Mill\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went here years ago and could seriously unload some insider knowledge, but I'll make it simple...AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS!",

This literally just means that not all schools will accept credits for the classes you take... but literally any school can choose to reject credits from another school for any reason. \n\nI went to community college at Victor Valley, and my credits were rejected everywhere EXCEPT FULL SAIL, because I only took technical programs.",

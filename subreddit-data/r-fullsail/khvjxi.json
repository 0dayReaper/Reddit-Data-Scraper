    "postText": "Hi! I am thinking about enrolling on the online program for computer animation. I had a couple of questions for those who are taking the same career online. But if not any advice would really help.\n\n1. How good is the networking? As an international student a thing that greatly attracts me its the ability to network with other proffesionals and fellow students. Will taking the course online help me with this? Is there a strong online community inside this college career? \n\nI understand \"real-life\" networking instead of online is probably much better. But at the time going to study in campus is not really an option. I guess my question would be, is only networking good enough?\n\n2. A common complaint Ive hear on forums online is that proffesors in the online degree take too long to respond to questions one migth have to the point it can damage ones grades. How true is this? Of course I understand some teachers will be more willing to help than others, but how common is this?\n\nAny other tips or experiences from people who are doing courses online will be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "I was on campus for game art ( the sister degree to computer animation ) networking is definitely better on campus, from what ive heard from online students it can be really hard to make connections and friends when you only interact online in your class forums. There are a few online communities built in our field but they arent super lively so you cant expect to make too many connections there. \n\nMy recommendation is not to worry about networking too much if you really want to go to the school. It happens naturally and you cant force or plan for it. If your work is awesome then you can still find work/ connections/ friends elsewhere.\n\nGood luck!",

    "postText": "Hey Everyone I'm seeking info on Full Sail before I dedicate my time and money to this university, I have seen posts good and bad about it but I'm still on the fence about going, I'm looking into doing Game Art Bachelor Degree or the Computer Animation Bachelor Degree. I love Gaming and have always wanted to peruse a job in this field but never knew where to start, but if anyone has taken these courses or went to this college online i would like a bit of feed back with your experience and if jobs look at full sail university degrees as a joke or not because I don't want to try to get a job and people laugh at me for going to full sail for my college. So any info will help thanks in advance.",

            "comment": "Broadly speaking, in the game industry no one really cares where you graduated from. It\u2019s far more about the skill set and the portfolio when it comes to Art. \n\nEntry level art jobs are quite competitive. There are a ton of applicants to each position. It\u2019s a bit less competitive in Animation, but your reel is even more important there. \n\nFull Sail will provide you with the knowledge and toolset to use the software necessary to succeed. You\u2019re going to be responsible for actually making a reel/portfolio outside of course work. (A demo/portfolio full of class work, is not going to cut it)\n\nLastly, it\u2019s a get out what you put in deal. The more you network and make effort to be the top of your class, the more likely you will find success. You\u2019re going to have to hustle for that first gig or two. Networking with industry and peers is key.",

The counselors are quite knowledgeable and great to chat with- I called and talked to them for over an hour regarding my son\u2019s possible enrollment in the music production dept. For him, the idea that everything is in his wheelhouse interest wise, and he\u2019s not taking things he won\u2019t use like organic chem or ELA Comp, or History to 1865, is a bonus. Is it expensive? 100%. But we\u2019re trying out a certificate program first to see if he can hang/if it\u2019s worth the investment, and the courses he takes in the certification will be credited back to him educationally and monetarily. I love that.",

            "comment": "Most things today don't really care about your degrre. My first degree is in cybersecurity, not from FSU, and it's largely the same. Regardless of your paper, they have questions they ask you, and often times they want to see a portfolio and some of the time you have to prove your worth. \n\nThe value from a degree is 1. What you learn, 2. The networking, 3. Friendships made, and 4. The experience. So first, what you learn. Do you need college for this? No, you don't. You could look up a class syllabus and mirror it, but I can almost promise you it won't be as insane. For example, your first course on 3D modeling is a Maya course, where they touch on unreal engine, and substance painter. \n\nThe courses prior to this are quite easy, but then this course comes around and it's something like 3 to 5 hours a night, not including the 9 hours of lecture time per month. So 3x5=15 + 9 = 24 hours a week, and any people retreat this course. Why? It's a LOT of information, and a lot of courses are like this. You could do it on your own, but will you set yourself deadlines like this? You do learn a lot at FSU. If it's worth it to you, that's up to you. You still have to take things further to really make if worth it. I'm in the Game Art degree. And have probably purchased a few hundred dollars in additional refferene and book material to help. You don't have to, but this will take you as far as you want it to.\n\n2. Networking is less common in the online courses, so I wouldn't use this as a reason to go. MYbe if you're in person, but the online course isn't worth it for just networking. \n\n3. Peers and Friendship - you can make some good friends, which is a type of networking. But these people end up being your support circle too, and ypu build off of each other. Keep in mind, this only exists if you make it happen, you have to put the effort out. \n\n4. The experience - FSU isn't a traditional college, and I think you actually learn more. It's 4 years of classes consolidated to 29 months, with the vast majority of fluff classes removed (though some classes still feel like a filler). Thexexperience is far different then traditional college. If you want to party and have a fun time, don't go to FSU. If you want to learn a lot, go to FSU. I went to OSU for my first degree and like FSU way more. \n\nIf you can put anywhere for 10 to 30 hours a week towards class work and skill development, go for it. FSU grad a bad rep mainly because of the low graduation rate. This rate is low because of the amount of people that start the school and don't understand that it's actually quite difficult.",

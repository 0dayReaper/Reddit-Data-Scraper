    "postText": "My entire household makes less than 25k a year. (5 people!)\n\nMy mom works as a cashier/saleswoman at a small boutique. She literally make 98% of the income. My little bro and I attend college full time and we can't manage a job at the same time. My grandma obviously doesn't work, and my aunt is disabled and is cared for by my grandmother. \n\nAnyways, sometimes I made $20 here and there freelancing, but no more than $500 a year. I'm absolutely terrified of defaulting on any loan I plan on taking out to attend full sail. I'm worried I won't find a job straight out of school, and I'm worried I'll run out of money halfway through and need to drop out. (I'm otherwise an excellent student, with a 3.5 GPA at my current local college)\n\nAnyone have any advice? I'd like to major in Game Art first, and then go back for Game Dev. A MFA in creative writing would be amazing, but I'll cross that bridge if it still stands in due time. I'll be taking the online versions of the degrees. ",

There are thousands out there, and many involve being low income.\nFinally, you can work and go to Full Sail. It\u2019s hard, but possible. Things like retail, or food service are good places to start. You\u2019re going to be tired, but I did it and so did many others.",

Why can't it just cover X amount of credits no matter how many you've attempted before? Ugh.",

They cannot enroll me in ANY BA/MA program unless I complete my AA.\n\nSince I hit 90 credit hours, 150% over the maximum attempted hours for an AA degree, my FAFSA refuses to pay out unless I graduate with the reaiming courses I need for my AA. I cannot afford to pay out of pocket for those courses, so that means I'm stuck.\n\nIf I transfer to Full Sail, my thinking is that they'll enroll me for a BA program, which will change my maximum attempted hours from 90, to 180. That means I'll easily be able to take 90 more credit hours worth of courses at full sail before my FAFSA goes f*** you, again.\n\nAm I wrong? ",

My husband was in a similar situation, and when he switched to FS for his BA his pell grant kicked back in along with loans. I'd assume they'd be the same for you, but you never know. I'd call FA and ask.\n\nWorst case, and it really sucks, you can always look at private loans. I had to do this because my parents didn't plan for my college at all, and UCF's estimate of 33K is a joke. My interest rate is STUPID high, but once my loans went over 38K, and I was no longer able to take out government loans, I took out private to finish. I paid those loans off the quickest due to their interest rate. \n\nYou will have the 6 month grace period after graduating to being payment on your loans, and your payment plan will be based on your income as long as they're government loans. You will never have to pay Pell back obviously. My income was so low up until the year before last that I wasn't actually required to make any payment. I did, because interest will ruin you, but I wasn't required to. Every February you will submit the previous year's taxes to show your income, and they will build you a repayment plan off of that income number.",

In the end, this industry cares more about your work and experience. Also since you have ambitions to get a masters... FSU is a real bad idea. National Accreditation is not the same as your current school. It's much less stringent than regional and as such your credits earned at Full Sail would be useless. You would need to completed a regional level bachelors before moving on to your masters. While your credits will likely transfer TO Full Sail, they will not count coming from there. The degree is pointless, people go here to learn the craft. Better off staying at your current school to earn your bachelors and move on to creative writing in the future. But personally I would do something else. Who's going to hire a creative writer? Words have gotten cheaper and cheaper these days. Going down this path as someone who's already poor is a death sentence in debt. As for what chain you could work at? If all physical labor is out the window your options are limited to the point where I can't think of a good suggestion. A game art degree is useless, and game dev is just a fancy name for expensive programming degree. Consider Full Sail's structure. Each class is set out in months. So each month there's ~30 people STARTING the degree and FINISHING the degree looking for work. Over two years, at just your school, you'd be fighting potentially 200+ people for the same job. Go make a fake resume with a fake name and send it out to all the jobs you can find right now for game art and put that you have a full sail degree on there just to see how often you're contacted back. They have piles of resumes from people like us!",

It depends on the institution accepting the credits to match their currently offered/required classes to classes on the transcript. My husband went from public to FSU, with a good portion his relevant credits transferring. My BA transferred to FSU for my masters just fine. When my husband wanted to go get his masters, his FSU BS transferred with no problems. Credit transfer is an issue with the entire industry, not just FSU. \n\n2) FSU degrees are not \"useless\". We have strong programs and weaker programs, sure, but to write it off as a useless decision is biased and you know it. FSU is able to accept things like Bright Futures, as well as pass audits because our job placement and other numbers over preform what is expected of us (unlike other private schools who don't.) \n\nFSU posts all of this out in the open. You don't have to go hunting for it. You just don't want to cite information that is against your bias. The degree he's going after has [80% employment rate] (https://go.fullsail.edu/2016-employment-statistics). Are there degrees with lower? Sure. FSU posts those too. Anybody capable of doing research is capable of picking the best Uni for their degree (FSU or other, doesn't really matter to me.)\n\nStop trying to dissuade young people from getting into industries we **NEED**. IDRC if he goes to FSU, UCF, whatever. He should pursue art if thats what he wants to do. Industries like creative writing, art, etc. are just as needed as others. Not everyone is cut out for STEM. Leave the kid alone. Go yell at the kids on your lawn or something.\n\n\nLove, \n\nSomeone with a \"useless\" degree from a useless Uni, married to someone with an \"expensive computer programing degree\" from a useless uni, who is able to afford *almost* anything she wants and lives very comfortably.

If you do decide to work full time before going back to school, there is nothing wrong with that! My husband graduated with his BS at 27. Theres no rush. I would look at big chains like Publix because they have positions like customer service and cashier which may require a lot of standing, but not a lot of lifting/walking. Also, maybe movie theaters, again, lots of standing, but no heavy lifting or lots of walking if you're in the ticket booth/taking tickets. You've got other places like restaurants that may require some walking, but not lifting if you're doing something like Host. You could try to find a place thats looking for a front desk person/administrative assistant - that will require almost no physical effort because you'll be sitting at a desk all day. ",

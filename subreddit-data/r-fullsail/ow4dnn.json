I\u2019ve read on here that (at least a couple years ago) you had to complete a few classes before you get the launch box. Anyone know if they grant any waivers or send you some items early? Just trying to see if I need to buy a cheap laptop until I get the box or not.\n\n-side note- I\u2019ve went to school a few years ago and completed some classes but not very many, I\u2019m not sure if that matters. Lol also, if anyone has any tips/warning about the program?",

I got the Logitech keyboard case and crayon (Logitech version of the pencil). Much cheaper. The crayon has better writing sensitivity than the pencil. I use One Note and Word to take notes, which you get in the Office 365 that comes in launch box. You can access that Day 1 of classes. \n\nI got Logitech because of my old boss at Best Buy. He said \u201cWhy would you buy a keyboard from Apple? Apple makes phones. Logitech makes keyboards.\u201d Made enough sense to me and I have zero complaints, especially since it\u2019s one third of the price of Apple accessories. \n\nMy computer died literally the week before class started so I feel your pain!",

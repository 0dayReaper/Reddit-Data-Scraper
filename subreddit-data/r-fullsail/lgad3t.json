Any for-profit school will literally spam the hell out of you once you provide the slightest amount of interest and they have your contact info.\n\nNot in any way knocking FS, I've been on campus for over a year. I just don't agree with their advertising approach.",

I love the program and I'm learning tons every day, but having someone 'interview me' on the phone about my 'dream job' just felt incredibly corny and honestly made me think twice about attending the school.",

    "postText": "Seeking some opinions here on this particular one, ended up having issues due to my BA not being regionally accredited but Full Sail seems like a good option to pursue a degree in Business/Marketing.   \n\n\nTrying to leave the Games Industry due to lack of job safety and it's still in line with what I do for the most part. Likewise, less important, but how friendly is this school to transwomen and men?   \n\n\nSeeking information not just for myself but for someone else with a very similar mindset to mine also stuck in the same boat. Any insight is beyond heavily appreciated, thank you!",

I'm mostly trying to gather information before I take the plunge. I know of a person with a successful career after undergoing the same thing, but I also know of another person that was not super successful, but they weren't in FS.  \n\n\nEither ways, believe me, your response is very appreciated. I just don't think there's a lot I can do from my current position seeing as how all the jobs in this field are already hard locked to requiring a degree in this particular field.",

            "comment": "How much is the program with loan interest? I'm guessing around 50k+? Is it online or in person? In person could easily add to the costs. Do you currently have any college debt? I went to Fullsail and while I am doing well I don't attribute much of it to my schooling. I mainly was self taught prior to going. I don't believe it helped me get any jobs, employers never asked me about it. My portfolio was the difference for me. I freelanced on some projects to get experience and offered discounts to get my first clients. This made a big difference for me and it will help you gain experience and connections which leads to better, high paying jobs. I just feel like getting any experience (even freelance) has more value. Obviously up to you! But I have seen a lot of people go into major debt at Fullsail and then are stuck paying a huge loan for 20 plus years (it's the interest that really hurts people). If I were to do it all again I wouldn't have gone. It was a fun experience and everyone was nice but it was not worth the 65k I paid at the time (I think it costs more now) would maybe calculate how much you are expecting to make and what your payments would be. There might be online training and certifications that are cheaper. The information that Fullsail teaches is available on Udemy and other places for far less money. You could do that, get certifications and maybe work on some freelance work to see where that takes you. Also maybe send out some bogos resume with Fullsail on there to see if you get any interest. I know that sounds nuts but it will give you an idea on how much a difference the degree will make with your current experience.",

Score atm (774) so that could always help some.   \n\n\nCurrently do not have any debt outside the random Credit Card usage here or there and of course, rent. Believe me, I've tried looking through a lot of the online courses and stuff and a lot of these seem like a waste of time as, again a lot of these places require degrees and/or heavy handed experience already in said field which I do not have.   \n\n\nYes, the financial straits are my concern as well, but at this point, I'm pretty much hard stuck where I'm at, and where I'm at, due to the nature of it, does not come with job safety/permanency.",

Not trying to discourage you just want to give you realistic expectations. You said you have a Bachelor's already with no debt which is great. You're in a good spot compared to most people on that alone. Would you consider an entry level role?",

A lot of times I see a degree or equivalent experience. You already have a bachelors so I would think that would satisfy that requirement and experience in social media marketing. Maybe reach out to some recruiters on linkedin and other people in the field and see if they can give you feedback or point you in the right direction. Sometimes it helps to talk to people who are doing the same job you are trying to get. Good luck!",

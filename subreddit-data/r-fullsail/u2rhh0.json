After the intro classes (which are super easy going), the workflow will vary greatly from class to class. \n\nSome classes will take up all your free time, where as others will only require 1 day of work. The courses that involve 3D modeling/animation will be the most time consuming. \n\nI believe 3D Foundations will be your first challenging class. It\u2019s not too demanding but it\u2019s very easy to fall behind on assignments and hard to catch up afterwards. \nThe hardest class I took so far (I\u2019m in my 12th month) was project and portfolio. In it you have to fully model, and texture/light/render a scene from a Pinterest image. Even with all my time I only finished 80% of it. This is also a class CA students have so just a heads up. \n\nI think if you have good time management skills, you will succeed. I definitely didn\u2019t manage my time well when I started, but they\u2019ve improved quite a bit since then. It may also be helpful to look at your course catalogue to see all the classes you will take.",

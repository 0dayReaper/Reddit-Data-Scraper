    "postText": "hey all, Im currently enrolled in the BSAP online program. Im at the end of my 5th month and I realized my current interests and goals for the future would be much better met by switching my major to BS of Digital Cine. Im going to switching all my current audio specific courses back to more foundational core classes that are shared among the two majors (art hist., pop culture, and fundamentals of phys. science, then in july Ill begin DS specific course work. But I digress... my question is, along with the full frame Sony cine cam, what is the lens thats issued with it? it just lists it as \"camera lens\" in the launchbox section of the FS website. thanks in advance",

    "postText": "hello i just started attending full sail this week online for recording arts and i will be moving to on campus in 6 months. i really want to have a career in the music industry but full sail is so expensive. i got the pathway scholarship but still i don\u2019t know if i\u2019ll have enough for an apartment even with roommates and the government loans i have to pay back after i graduate. i will have about 24k saved up by the time i move to full sail but i\u2019m just wondering if it worth it to go to this school or should i look for a cheaper option? i want to do music for my career but idk if i can afford this college.",

            "comment": "I've noticed a common denominator with the people posting negative reviews, posts, and videos.\n\n1.   Nearly half my classes cannot follow a rubric and syllabus to save their lives.\n\n2.   A lot or people do the bare minimum thinking the instructors will magically teach them; that's every university and college.    You have to perform and actually take what you're learning to the next level. \nYou are wasting money if you are just going through the motions.\n\n\n3.  Attitude.    Everybody wants to be a Rockstar and talk the talk but a lot of students I've seen have had a bad attitude and immature work ethic.    I see students getting literally hostle and combative to instructors more than willing to help them but they show up honestly not remotely prepared for college level work\n\n\nLiterally every single discussion board instructor asks for 200 words about something,  and a third of the class will write 5 words or 2 sentences saying somethinglike \"I hope you achieve your goals\" adding no value or demonstrating any genuine will to actually be there.\n\n\nIt's honestly the only frustrating part I've noticed about full sail so far.   \n\n\nFS is not meant to be the skim thru party school.   Your experience at fullsail will ultimately be up to you.",

There was no stopping me and I\u2019ve worked my ass off the entire time I\u2019ve been in the program. It\u2019s totally worth it to me. My portfolio is stacked and I\u2019m about to graduate with a 3.9 GPA. There\u2019s no way I don\u2019t acquire a solid job in my field once I move out west this spring. I already have an in at Epic Games as a writer should I choose to go that route.\n\nOn the other hand, more than half of my class should have saved their money because they\u2019re not good writers or creative thinkers. They\u2019ve continuously put in the minimum effort (if even that) and they do not care. They even complain about writing and still have no grasp on grammar or spelling. In their cases, it is *not* worth it and they\u2019ve wasted a ton of money. They will not get jobs in the industry and will probably blame the school for the rest of their lives\u2014stupidity is complaining of misfortune when the fault is your own.",

Now I *actually* want this so badly. I've thought about it and I'm willing to take the loans out in exchange for the networking opportunities at full sail, plus a stacked portfolio is immeasurably useful. I'm not going to just put in minimal effort, I'm planning on this being my full time job for the next two years.\n\nIdk what my point is lol I just have heard this same thing, and people who have complained seem to have expected a guaranteed job after graduation. The odds of getting a job increase with effort, no?",

Knowing basic office software for pretty much anything ( power-point, word, excel) is important.  Knowing what to ask and where to look for answers is very important.",

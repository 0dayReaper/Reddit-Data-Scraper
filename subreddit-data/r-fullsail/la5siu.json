    "postText": "Hello all! I have been thinking of ways to connect with other students to share experiences, advice, or collaborate with each other. I begin my term today, and I would love to chat with other people that recently started. Are there any group chats or discord available or should I make one? \n\nLet me know if you would be interested to be a part of this or if you know any chat with new students (preferably non-affiliated to fullsail)\n\nEdit: I made a discord!! Join here: https://discord.gg/yAUT4EjrzB\n\nThis chat is for current and upcoming students only. No alumni\u2019s or faculty.",

I made some good connections the first few months of my program, but alas, things change, friends fade, and time goes on.\n\nAnywho, count me in!\n\nEdit: typo",

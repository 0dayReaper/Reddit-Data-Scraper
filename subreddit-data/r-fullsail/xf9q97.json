    "postText": "This might be just a petty rant but I'm in one of my classes, and the assignment wants me to make a 3D art using glue, or tape. But at the same time I'm over here panicking because I'm a full time student who isn't working I can't afford glue. \\[These classes require you 40 hours, and I'm over here doing this I don't have time to look for a job\\].\n\nSo you're telling me you gave all this art supplies, but didn't even give me glue when one of the project require it? This doesn't make any sense.",

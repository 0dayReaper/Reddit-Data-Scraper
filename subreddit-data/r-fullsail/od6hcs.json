That being said, much of what you experience at Full Sail depends on YOUR drive and determination; nothing about Full Sail is an easy ride, especially for online students. Your success will more or less solely rely on your ambition and motivation to succeed. There are plenty of resources and instructors are always willing to help, but if you\u2019re the kinda person who loses interest or gets burnt out easily, Full Sail will be a tough go fo you.\n\nEdit: typo",

I'm having a great time with the classes. But they get harder after the first year. The first year are all easy straight A courses. My plan is to become a music producer so audio production was a good pick for me.",

            "comment": "If you're looking at going for Audio/Music or film production, I would definitely say NO. First off, the industry has changed so much. Much of the audio stuff you can actually learn on your own, but the reality of it is, to be a good producer, you really need to know music, really, really well...and it helps to have an inside track. That said, start off in the industry doing internships at audio production studios, even it means just simply taking out the trash. That will get you a better in than going to Full Sail. Brown nose the hell outta people there and spend ALL the extra you have at the studio learning from the pros. Show them that you can work hard and that you are willing to learn. Take some musical theory classes...actually, take a lot of musical theory classes. Learn the basics of as many instruments as possible. Going into audio production takes a lot of luck in this day and age, but with hard work, it can be done. But don't expect anything from Full Sail that you can't already learning working at a studio. Plus, you won't acquire a bunch of debt in the process.",

    "postText": "I went to Full Sail and graduated n 2012. I did not bust my butt and I didn't study hard but quite frankly the school doesn't challenge you to study hard or bust your butt. I passed all my classes without any resistance. The teachers were inept and uninterested and how could they be they see you for at most 2 months of there lives. I made friends had good times and did like some of my teachers because some are interested in you if only for a moment. I even got a job as a head producer at a local station in Miami, Fl (not exactly a small market). I've since left my old position and went on to work as a bond trader. Having said all this my conclusion of my time in FullSail is that is was the biggest mistake of my life. The students attending are entitled, stupid and lazy. The entire time I was there I was told things like \"most people don't have what it takes to complete the program\" essentially only the weak drop out, words eerily similar to those propagated most cults. I'd like to hit the hardest misconception and dispel the schools biggest mantra among faculty and students alike, the notion that you get out what you put in because its a manipulation so heinous as to make my blood boil, but before I do I'd like to highlight that all these advanced marketing techniques are aimed at 17, 18, yr olds mostly kids and young adults and for good reason. Let me take this time to be as articulate as possible as I don't want my words to be misconstrued as coming from a place of anger, although I personally and livid at the entire organization and hold nothing but the highest level of disdain toward their practices as its modern day hucksterism in full effect. So, back to \"you get what you put in\". Let's do some math (albeit, I know, not the average FullSail students strong suit), the cost of attending FS is around 100k (it was about 80 when I enrolled in 2010) so lets break that down, if you were to buy yourself a c500, top line audio gear, an Arri lighting kit and a monster processing computer with all the video and audio editing bells and whistles you'd be about 50k in the hole compared to 80k that you'd spend on 2 yrs at FullSail. The difference of course being that if you went to FullSail you'd leave with no equipment to call your own, except maybe a computer 5 years away from being obsolete, and that's not all, if you go to FullSail you better have wealthy parents willing to shill out 2 yrs of rent and living expenses at about 1k a month (a conservative estimate) so you can go ahead and tag another 24k to tuition costs. So your options here are buying yourself a mini studio's worth of equipment and learning as much as you can with the gear you now own or you can plunk twice that to hang out with a bunch of cool guys for a couple of years. Oh and don't forget these are student loans we're talking about, the operative word being loans, meaning interest, meaning 7% interest rates and at an average graduating loan looking to be around 60k that means you'll be indebted for the next 25 years of your life. So if your planning on going to FullSail also make sure your not planning on saving money or investing in your future like purchasing a home because the two are mathematically improbable. Now, I know that it's also highly improbable for a teenager or someone in their 20's with little to no capital to find someone willing to loan them 50k, so forget that but remember you get out what you put in, so why not get a job at your local starbucks save up and buy books on cinematography, audio, editing, graphics, and maybe after a while get yourself a computer that can process editing videos and do it that way because in total you'll have spent around 2k on books and a competent computer and don't forget you get out what you put in. OF COURSE YOU GET OUT WHAT YOU PUT IN!!!!! That's a basic economic tenant, what kind of organization could exist if you didn't get out what you put in!!! How dare you explain you get out what you put in to anyone over the age of 6??!! Moreover that's not whats sold to you when your about to enroll. You could go to the local library and get out what you put in, this logic applies to everything viable in existence and is therefore a manipulative line used to justify a stupid lazy and uninterested faculty. And if you think those words are harsh then ask yourself why is a competent person not in the field making a better living as a professional, at least with regional accredited schools there's a reason for a prof to want to teach, most profs at regionally accredited schools are retired from their field or find more satisfaction in teaching not to mention the research afforded at a regionally accredited program. (By the way educate yourself about the difference between regional and nationally accredited schools, fyi FullSail's accrediting body ACCSC changed its name after being successfully sued by irate graduates upset that they had been told their credits were transferable to regional schools, they weren't) The FACT is that those with interest and access to equipment used in film and tv are going to learn their craft. The real rub is that the students aren't the ones with access to this equipment, the teachers are, and that is the ultimate betrayal of trust, as it is you the student who is paying for your teachers to educate themselves. The fact of the matter is each potential student is putting their name, future, and a significant amount of debt forward when they enroll to FullSail \"University\" I think they deserve more than being told, \"well thanks for your cash now remember your on your own, hope you got out what you put in\", its twists my stomach just thinking about it. But lets forget all of what I've written so far and lets say your still head strong stubborn and won't let a long winded post from a faceless stranger stop you from following your dreams. Well to you I'd like to share my first job coming out of school, FullSail was nice enough to connect me with touchline video, my first taste of real world film and tv action. The job was in Orlando and I was living in Dania at the time so I had to drive up and back not to mention the commute to disney (where the job was) and back and the job consisted of three days 12 hr days standing in one spot in blistering heat, no exaggeration I got blisters on the tops of my ears from standing in the sun all day all for the princely sum of 500$, calculating expenses I was paid less than minimum wage and that's the same kind of job you can expect FullSail to hook you up with when you graduate. Just think about the economics of it all, how many people work in the film industry and compare that number to FullSail graduates, a class of about 100 every month. I've talked to my friends even the smartest ones the most diligent and well meaning the ones's who directed and wrote their final projects in 35 mm and 16 mm boast jobs like film editor for a local business or tech director and even working electric for one of the most popular shows on television at the moment and I KNOW FOR A FACT that YOU DO NOT NEED A DEGREE IN FILM to get these jobs, all you need is work experience and or a reel. Guys, Full Sail is not technically a scam but it is a waste of your time and money and not just 20 dollars or 200 or even 2k its about 100 thousand dollars, to a kid without a strong concept of money that may not have much of an effect but as an adult in his late 20's with unshakable student loans, (not even bankruptcy can eliminate student loans) I can assure you its nothing to take lightly. It's a crying shame to see what's being done in the name of \"education\". Full Sail is fleecing students one graduating class at a time. They're overcharging you for a shoddy education, and quite frankly the film world isn't that complicated to begin with, so no, don't go, don't get trapped and don't let them take advantage of your naivet\u00e9. I'm just one person and this is my opinion, however I'm not alone in my thinking and everything I've just shared is honest and done with the intent to help out young naive kids passionate about their dreams, also the numbers aren't made up or exaggerated and my conclusions are objective and rational. If you got this far I'd like to thank you and implore you to not stop reading, fact check me, do your own research, make your own conclusions!",

            "comment": "Writing this on my phone, so expect typos. I graduated in 2010 from the film program, and most of what you said is totally true. My starting class was 140 students..so big they split us into two sections. Most of these kids were spoiled, their parents would pay for everything, and most of the time they'd show up stoned out of their minds. When we finished the math class(basic college algebra) over half of the class failed. Half!! There was outrage towards the school from all the failing kids. They ended up dumbing down the math class 2 times after I passed it just to get the kids out of there. My class had 2 DPs, both asshole rich kids who didn't give a shit. I ended up using a camp op to DP my final project and it is really showed. Most of the kids would just show up to class, turn on their computer and surf Facebook until the 4 hours were up. I stayed late and become close with a lot of teachers who would help me with personal shoots and they would also let me help on their projects.\n\nI put a lot of work into that school, I got to write/direct most of the big projects like HD, 16mm, and 35mm. A lot of the class hated me for this, didn't really make as many friends as most people. I was 20 when I started the school and noticed a lot of lab instructors are just failed students who didn't leave Orlando after graduation. I left right away and moved to LA. I got a shit job that paid 10 bucks an hour and worked at Starbucks 30 hours a week just to pay my student loans. I thought I was fucked for a good 9 months of my life. After applying and applying I finally got a good job offer. Been with the same company now over 3 years and things are going great. I run their commercial post department, write creative for spots, and occasionally shoot a web video for them when they need extra hands. I worked my ass off to get where I needed to be and never gave up, but full sail didn't really help. I learned a lot more in the real world and would have loved to talk to my younger self before going to the school.\n\nI maybe have 20-30 class mates on Facebook out of the original 140. A lot are surprisingly doing alright! The few friends I kept in touch with all work out here and are killing it. Again, these are people who bust their asses and aren't socially awkward. I do see the occasional depressed Facebook status from old classmates but they didn't take their education as seriously as I did, so I feel no pity. \n\nSide note, if anyone is at the school right now and you have student loans. Sign up for work study ASAP. You can make some money by basically interning for classes during your off time. I think you can do up to 30 hours a week. I didn't take out any living expenses because of this. ",

I'm not bitter, FullSail gave me a chance to follow my dream and then wake up from a nightmare, without it I wouldn't have the life experience that has brought me to where I am today. I'm trying to reach out to someone whose considering the school as an option for their future but hasn't yet fleshed out the ramifications or given full and appropriate thought to what student loans really mean and help them by giving them first hand information, information the FullSail marketing machine does their best to keep potential students away from. You've made your choice and drank the kool aid, and its yours to make but if you're going to engage in an argument the best way to not show yourself to be foolish is to avoid sweeping statements like \"No college anywhere guarantees you an amazing job after you graduate!\" and \"This school isn't perfect, but no school is.\" Most people aren't stupid and these kinds of statements alert an active mind that bullshit is approaching. Also if you want people to take you seriously avoid writing words in all caps. And zeek, this may shock you but you'd be surprised by how much you don't know. I'd bet you're like most FullSailors, living life in a bubble, \"I know that no one will give a shit where I got my degree from...\" And don't short sell your imagination I'm sure with enough thought you could come up with at least a dozen different mistakes you would have made on a real set. But don't worry because if you're lucky enough to land film work after graduation you won't need to image it you'll make them every single day, at least for the first month, that is if you're lucky. You're having a fun time with friends and I get I've been there, but let me clue you in right now, they won't be there for you when you graduate. And lastly kid, save your pity for someone whose earned it, and you don't have to look too far down the FullSail alumni line to find one. I'm doing just fine whereas most FullSail graduates are still pulling at daddies wallet and sucking on mommies tits. But that won't be you right? You won't be asking for money or looking for handouts when you graduate after all you've got the FullSail Network! ",

Nobody has ever asked me if I have a degree. It's never come up. \n\nThere are a lot of Full Sailers working in the business, but there are even more Full Sailers who are not. Out of my ~80 person graduating class, maybe 10 or 12 are actually working; and that's a higher than average percentage. \n\nTheir \"Career Development\" department WILL NOT get you a job. I've been working for money for 3 years, and all they've ever called me for (and only twice in 3 years at that) is protracted *unpaid* internships. They DO NOT have the \"industry connections\" that they claim they do. \n\nHere's the kicker: Not only are your credits not transferable (which they tell you); **YOUR COMPLETED DEGREE from Full Sail WILL NOT BE RECOGNIZED as legitimate** by a majority of schools (they *do not* disclose this and may even lie to you about it). So if you want to get a Master's in the future; you'll need to start over from scratch as a freshman and get another bachelor's degree (unless of course, you want to get another Fisher-Price degree from Full Sail).\n\nTL;DR\n\n- You can learn it all for free (and get a paycheck)\n\n- You don't need a degree\n\n- Nobody cares if you have a degree\n\n- Having a degree will not assist you in getting a job in the industry\n\n- Full Sail will not assist you in getting a job.\n\n- Their degrees might as well come on a roll so you can save on TP; they will not increase your income potential, and they will leave you in crippling debt.",

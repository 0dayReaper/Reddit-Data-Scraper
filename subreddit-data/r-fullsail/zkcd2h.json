    "postText": "Looking at enrolling in the cyber security bachelor's and I haven't seen much info on here from the current. as I understand it is a relatively new program I am looking for any insight on the level of difficulty something like this may be for someone who does have 2 kids and a full-time job I also have been out of school for \\~8yrs. I can see that it is expensive but no one has told me exactly how much it will cost yet. Start date Jan 2nd. any insights at all would be helpful, anything I should brush up on in the meantime?",

The only programming you need though is python(thank fuck) but other than that you work with a lot of VMs and IT shit for the first half of the program. The way it is broken down is the first half is an IT associates degree and then a cyber security bachelors the last half. You have until you get the associates to switch programs.",

I am still interested in the school and feel like I will pursue it again in \\~18 months or so. Hopefully they will still offer the degree completion program at that time and you can let us know what the second half starts to look like.",

Once I am able to relieve some of my financial burdens and transfer enough credit for the degree to not hurt so bad I do think I will be enrolling in the program. Good luck to you. In the meantime, I have been supplementing as many certs as I can.",

My personal opinion- look more into schools such as WGU or UMGC as opposed to full sail. I believe they will offer more bang for your buck, and have long standing programs that are known to be good. Both of those schools are also tailored to working professionals.",

You can finish 5 classes one month, two classes in a week, take two months off and come back and finish a few more before your 6 month \u201cterm\u201d is up. \n\nOr you can just take all 6 months to finish your standard 4 classes for 12 credit hours over 6 months routine.",

Mainly just need the degrees to check off boxes for promotions at work.",

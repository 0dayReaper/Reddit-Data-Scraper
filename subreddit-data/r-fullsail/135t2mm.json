    "postText": "Hey guys and gals, today is the first day of my new class (MONTH 2: Week 1) the first class I was creative presentation (which I landed an A in for my final overall grade. The second class I\u2019m beginning today  is (Psychology Of Play)..\n\nThe question I have is I\u2019ve seen on YouTube people get these boxes and usually they receive one by itself which is usually an iPad and then a little later they get the bulk package ( the computer and keyboard etc) \n\n\nI\u2019m going for audio production, I wanted to know for those who did get the iPad .. how long did it take for you to get it ? So I can judge around when I\u2019ll be getting mine. \n\n\nAnd also when did you receive the bulk portion ?? ( the laptop and what have you)\n\nThanks guys/gals and or whatever else is out there l",

    "postText": "So, as the title says, I'm contemplating going to Full Sail for my masters. From what I've seen online, most people have experience with full sail in game dev, or film. It also looks like a lot of people did a bachelors degree, though that's an assumption. \n\nHas anyone here done this masters? how did it go? do you find it useful? What do you do now? And most importantly, has anyone ever rejected you at a job because of where you graduated from?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance",

I feel like you\u2019d need to meet some animators and have someone create a web show or something while there and that be your portfolio. You meet ppl and do stuff while there that\u2019s the idea behind this school you don\u2019t just go there you gotta do something while there.",

    "postText": "Hey all, \n\nI'm an international student and I've just completed my online application for an MFA in Film Production - starting date November 22nd. Though I'm not sure what the next step is supposed to be since I'm only getting a page that says \"Your Application Has Been Successfully Completed!\" From what I've experienced with other schools, they usually provide information on the next steps (an admission advisor will contact you, where to submit the required documents, etc.) but with Fullsail, I've gotten nothing so far. I would appreciate if any experienced folk could share some insight. Thanks in advance for your help!",

Your schedule is too sporadic every month, no employer would bend over backwards for someone who can work 1-2 says a week and change their hours every 4 weeks.\n\nWhen I went in 08 I did workstudy at the school, worked at the book center and random class labs as I progressed through classes. You could max out 30 hours a week at minimum wage. There\u2019s also school tours they do every month and they hire students for that day, it\u2019s easy but hot as hell and you have to be there at 5am.",

I went so RA so I made most my extra cash by recording first month RA fat beats kids before they dropped out around month 4. I was also at FS when they began transitioning certain classes to online. So it might be easier to get a part time job now that they have moved more classes online. Still pisses me off that I moved to fucking Florida and they switched some classes to online. If you live near campus you should have the option to take a class in a real fucking classroom. Still pisses me off how shitty the music history class was. I was the first class to take it online. Anyway it might be easier to work now seeing as they keep moving classes online.",

I remember half my class failed basic college algebra and they lowered the difficulty the following month so they could get these kids out. The actual math instructor vented to us about how they were making it too easy just to crank kids out. I find that you really got what you put into it. The instructors weren\u2019t incredible, but they def would give you as much attention and appreciation you would give to them.",

Just manage your time well.\n\nI'm in the Game Art program, it helps to work a night shift and instead of doing 8hrs a day 5 days a week, try and get 10hrs a day for 4 days a week. That way you get 3 full days off for school, and you still get 80 hour pay checks. If you can and it works with your schedule, work weekends.",

Most of it is designed for helping people who were taken advantage of by for profit schools.\n\nSorry to hear and good luck!",

That said, Full Sail does not force you to attend their school. This can be said for any other education institution. It's a tough pill to swallow, but it is what it is.",

I will however say that I have also been in this school a little over a year, month 16, and it is completely what you make of it. I hear just as many great stories, as I do negative, and while I do not completely agree with their methodology, they do allow for your own creativeness. This is a great school, and I am sorry you had a bad experience.\n\nEdit: got informed of downloading a new program this week. Instructions to do so are outdated, this school gives no fucks. I must have gotten a good grade when I wrote this earlier.",

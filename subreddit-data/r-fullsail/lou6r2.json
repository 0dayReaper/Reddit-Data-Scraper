I have received 100 on every assignment since started and I\u2019m worried about struggling in English comp. Can anyone tell me what it\u2019s like? What should I expect? And what are some suggestions on preparation before the class starts?",

I took the class a couple of months ago and it was actually really enjoyable because the first week we summarized an article, the next week we summarized an article with an opposing view on the same topic, and by the end we were combining both authors opinions and adding our own.",

I took AP English classes in high school and struggled with the class because it wasn\u2019t asking for as much as I was used to in an English class (for instance, I went back and took out passives, but it wasn\u2019t required). Either way, still got an A+ overall.",

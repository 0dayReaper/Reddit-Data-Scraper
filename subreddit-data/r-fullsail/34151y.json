    "postText": "I started in September of last year and since then my car broke down, my bike tire is blown, and I have no other option except to walk.  I rarely am able to find a ride to and from class and I even have to hoof it late at night around 1 a.m.  I used to love this school, but now I fear for my life every time I walk..especially late at night.  Many people have suggested free shuttles to and from school and better security but I'm not sure Full Sail will even do anything about that.  Also, we are informed during orientation that we cannot arm ourselves, even with pepper spray, which makes us easy targets for all the passerby that plan on taking our $3000 worth of belongings.  We are huge targets walking around with our badges and bags so my advice to everyone is to put your badge away when you leave class, walk home aware of your surroundings and with no headphones on.  Don't text and walk, but keep your phone in an easy access place so you can call the police if something looks suspicious to you.  Travel in pairs and stay safe everyone. ",

            "comment": "Did they actually specify you can't have pepper spray? That's stupid. I've heard that some people 'carry' on campus. So I don't know...\nI don't have a car anymore due to an accident and don't bike anymore and can somehow never save up for another one, and riding the bus is a pain as it stops running after midnight and only starts up again at 4am! \n\nThe 'bomb threat' was someone leaving their backpack behind, which is stupid. but the robberies are what we should be worried about, and frankly, Full Sail needs to step up it's game and do something about those issues.

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm looking into the online Music Production degree here. It seemed to be a program that had a lot of really good opportunities, but I have some concerns. I keep seeing posts and articles questioning the legitimacy and quality of the degree you receive here. It appears to me that the credits will not transfer to another school, but that isn't really a concern for me, because my goal is to work in the music production industry. My main question is whether or not a Full Sail degree has the weight that they claim it does. I had a tour recently, and they were constantly mentioning that a full sail degree was basically an automatic job in the entertainment industry. I feel like they might be trying to sell me on something, and not giving me a realistic idea of what happens following graduation. I'd like to hear from some of the graduates that aren't in the 0.1% of \"hall of fame\" inductees, and what opportunities a Full Sail degree realistically affords you. Thanks to anyone who can help me out!",

Any school who tells you their degree somehow guarantees you a job is lying.",

The networking of in-person education is worth it if you're a top 10% kind of student. But online there's no chance to make friends.",

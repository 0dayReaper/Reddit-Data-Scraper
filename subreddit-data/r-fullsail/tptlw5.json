I\u2019ll be starting the beginning of May and don\u2019t really need it since I already have a great desktop and laptop. But was also wondering if it would be better than what I currently have. Also is anyone else in the Computer Science degree?",

The fact they started shipping out 80 series equipped laptops shortly after just p*sses me off to no end. I couldn't even flip it because the value tanked with the announcement of the M1. \n\nSorry. OT. I know. But it hurts. Congrats on the 80's cards. Ima go cry now. Lol.",

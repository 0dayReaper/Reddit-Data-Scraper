    "postText": "Went to this college had a great time until one teacher who decided she hated me and failed me after i did ALL the work required and gave 100% attendance, and when i complained to the school they totally just took her side and tried to make me re pay to take the class. Fuck this school all they care about is money , greedy cock suckers like every other organization in america. Bullies doing everything they can to fuck over the poor. Nice guys who really do get fucked hard out here.\n\nI failed the class once, tried to retake was force to re-pay i tried to fight, they told me I owe more money I couldn't take on more loans, nobody would listen... but still my fault for going where i needed doing what I needed.... I deserve it I guess fuck me for existing...",

I had literally NO recourse. Pay 1/2 of the tuition i already payed or I'm fucked.

Everything worked out for you, that means everything always works out for everybody else's the same way.... Hate to break it to you but not everybody's life is sunshine and happiness. But yeah I'm a piece of shit who failed once and doesn't get those same chances as everybody else, again I FAILED ONCE! but you get 3 times to fail, and im the piece of shit for complaining... How far up your ass is your head? Also, fuck you entitled rich people whom get handed everything, and then tell me i have to worked harder than you for the same shit... Educate yourself before you go talking about shit you clearly know nothing about. It's not about having my hand held, it's about not getting fucked over.\n\nStill can't believe this guy \"everything worked out for me, therefore it must work out for everybody\" you could use some empathy, I'd lend you mine, but I'm, fresh out...",

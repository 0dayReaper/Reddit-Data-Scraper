    "postText": "Hey, so I had to retake a class for 3D fundamentals and I was doing really well with turning in assignments up until the last assignment. I had gotten a 90% on most every other assignment but the last one, because the last one ended up late  and there was a misunderstanding on my end about turn in policy so my homework was 4 days late. I don't know if I'll get the actual grade at this point because of how things worked out and this puts me down to 60% since the final two assignments were a huge chunk of the grade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was wondering if there was any chance that I might be able to retake this class for a second time or if this ruins my chances of completing the bachelors for computer animation since this would be my second time repeating the class.",

My biggest pitfall this class was trying to cram classes with work during the holidays. It ended up in me missing due dates and not understanding the late turn in policy. Thanks for the response!",

I remember losing a lot of classmates in 3DF, that and Model Creation have a lot of repeating students so I wouldn\u2019t worry. \n\nYou can take a class up to 3 times I believe (I\u2019m not positive, I haven\u2019t looked into it). It can very easily sneak up on you, doesn\u2019t take too many late or missing assignments. I set reminders on my phone and stuff, if something is even a day late you\u2019ll get marked down a lot. It\u2019ll have it\u2019s really rough moments, just stick with it and you\u2019ll get through. ",

Online students are only checked based on academics, so I think there is a distinct possibility that I can try for a 3rd time. I'll probably have to call the school and ask. Thanks for the response!

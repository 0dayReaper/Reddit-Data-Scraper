That's not to say it's a bad program, but it's very important to understand that they are different.\n\nHowever, I am friends with a handful of campus students who are in the film bachelor program and they are loving it. Lots of hands on experience, great instructors, and you're surrounded by a bunch of other students who are very serious and dedicated to making films.",

Hands-on set experience - A lot of the classes in person take place on soundstages. Students work on set with designated roles starting pretty early on. You have experienced instructors teaching you the on set etiquette, the terms, the equipment, all of it. Yes, there will be more to learn on a big set, but you've got a solid foundation. Online we're making our own sets. Our instructors aren't there to correct us if we use sandbags wrong or don't tape down wires, etc.\n2. The people we're surrounded by - in person, all your classmates are trying to make it in the film industry, just like you. And that means that you have a couple dozen people who all want to make films all the time. It's not just a pool of people to draw from when assembling crews for your student films, but also when making personal projects outside of school. And it means you have a lot of opportunity to work on other people's work, too. Online we're asking our friends to act, hold a boom pole, etc. Maybe we can find other people who want to make films nearby, but it's hard to gauge how serious they are about it, unless they're already working in film, but then it feels weird asking them to work for free.\n\nTo a lesser degree, which makes a difference when you graduate, in-person students are going to have a leg up in being remembered and recommended for work by their instructors. This is just because face-to-face meetings always stick in people's minds better. I'm actually taking a trip to Orlando soon primarily to meet with some of the instructors and help my connection with them stick a bit better.\n\nA smaller point is that I feel like a handful of the instructors just don't really have time for their online students. Some clearly do and that's amazing. But quite a bit of feedback I've gotten back on submitted footage has been generic and feels like the instructor barely looked at my work. Which is a shame because I have tried to push myself hard through the program and *I* can see a big difference in what I'm able to do now vs when I started.\n\n&gt;I\u2019m over halfway through dcbs and don\u2019t really feel like I know how to make much\n\nSend me a DM, we can talk about where you're at and where you feel like your strengths and weaknesses are. I'd be more than happy to see if I can help in any way. I also have Discord if that's an easier way for you to chat.",

I have a friend who is now a screenwriter in LA (no, she did not go to Full Sail, she went to UT in the College of Fine Arts, the department of Theater and Dance). But I will tell you, she was always writing. She wrote editorials in the college newspaper, which got her a writing gig for the Austin Statesman. She wrote and performed improv acts, she started a blog before there was ever a thing called a blog. She was ALWAYS writing. I thought she was crazy for leaving her cush job in Austin for LaLa Land, but she did. She worked hard...very hard, for many years. But over time she chipped away and landed writing gigs. She was one of the writers for Moana and Wreck it Ralph, among others. Her animated short is now up for an Oscar this week. It wasn't school that taught her to write, it was herself and many, many years of doing it.",

Look at how screenwriters make their work get seen, and consider if FS is going to set you up to do that. Their film program is really useful if you want a taste of everything and aren\u2019t sure where you would like to land but you know you want it to be somewhere film-related. \n\nNumber 1 skill for screenwriters: storytelling, including story structure. That\u2019s a specific, really detailed field that will need your full blast focus. Grazing simply will not take you all the way. To be a screenwriter after Full Sail\u2019s film program, expect to do more school or intensive self-study on the field.",

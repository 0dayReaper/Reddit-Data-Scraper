So I got it a month earlier than most that started with me I guess?\n\nAnyways I'm not sure why they sent this tablet too. \nComputer science with Ai",

They send them when they have them, and they also don't send exactly what it says they'll send either, the pages are outdated.\n\nDoesn't matter though, you'll get an email when it ships, just be round to pick it up. If you're local, head to the distribution centre in building 4 and get your stuff there, much easier than waiting for them to ship expensive shit to your nearby apartment.",

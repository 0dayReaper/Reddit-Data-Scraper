            "comment": "The admission interview is nothing more than a brief discussion to see if the program you applied for is right for you.  For example, if you applied to the game design program they will want to be sure that the demanding schedule of the program is something you'll be interested in and able to keep up with.  In that example if you didn't know how to use a computer or didn't care for video games then they'd probably not recommend that you proceed with taking those classes.",

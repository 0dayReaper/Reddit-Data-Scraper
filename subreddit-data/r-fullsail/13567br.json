    "postText": "I'm going through enrollment but I feel like I'm going in circles. I've called a few times but I keep getting the run around I feel. I'm supposed to start this month (my start date was actually supposed to be today 5/1). My high school took forever to send me a transcript and enrollment wouldn't talk to me about my next steps until they had it. I had everything else sent it and filled out. I have yet to talk to someone about costs and it's giving me serious anxiety. \n\nNo one I've emailed ever emails back and I can never seem to get ahold of financial aid. I'm looking for some advice since I'm not even registered for classes. I've been calling once or twice a week and they either tell me I should be hearing  from someone soon or I wait on hold until I get routed back to enrollment. Did anyone else have this experience or is it just me? Any advice or pointers would be greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "Hey Lizcos! \nThe wait on your high school transcripts definitely helped with that delay, but don\u2019t worry :) \nFrom sound of it, you might have to start on 5/29, but I promise that enrollment will walk you through tuition and what that will all look like before you start, and that you even have a whole 3-week trial once you do start. Hang in there!\n\nTry calling today and ask if your transcripts are on file with us! If they are, and your FAFSA is up too, then enrollment should hopefully be able to at least give you some insight.\n\nSorry that this is all I can do \ud83d\ude2a I hope it works out~",

They have all my stuff on file and have for about a month now but no one has gotten in contact with me about my next steps and no one when I call ever tries to help without me talking to financial aid. I'm getting really frustrated. I waited on hold for financial aid for two hours on Friday. This was after speaking to someone in enrollment who said if they didn't get someone on the line before transferring me she would set up a call back. Then at 7:59 the call hung up because they were closing. When I called back the general number they told me it shouldn't have hung up and that they would be in Saturday until 8pm again but I called yesterday and no one is in that office on Saturdays.\n\nI am beyond frustrated and upset and with what my experience has been trying to simply enroll I'm nervous about how things will be when I start. I honestly don't know what to do. I'm sure some people think I'm just trying to complain about something but I'm genuinely looking for some advice and help because I'm not sure what else to do...",

I did notice a couple times I got a newer or inexperienced person on the phone, having to repeat myself a bit. But overall they called me back often. I did start the process 2 months before my start date, so we had plenty of time to get ducks in a row. They already had my transcripts &amp; documents from the first time I applied about 8 years ago, so I\u2019m sure that helped.\n\nBut I wonder if it\u2019s the time of day you are calling? Everyone in the early/midday shifts seem pretty competent. I didn\u2019t really talk to anyone after 4pm &amp; honestly didn\u2019t even know they were open that late, til 8. So maybe try earlier, if possible. I never waited on hold for more than 15 mins. \n\nI\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019ve had a bad enrollment experience tho! :/ don\u2019t give up! Hopefully you get some of the good folks on the phone soon!",

I think it may have just been I was getting inexperienced people to be honest... I did finally talk to someone and unfortunately it's not in the cards for me right now. I don't qualify for any financial aid or the momentum scholarship. I also can't take out enough in student loans. I'm not 24 yet so I have to file everything under a parent even though I've been independent for almost 5 years now. They both do well for themselves and have good credit. So I guess I'm waiting another year \ud83d\ude43. I'm really bummed since I was super excited to do something with my life finally but oh well.",

I remember having to get all this stuff from my parents &amp; my dad\u2019s taxes were messed up, which caused financial aid issues. I ended up attending a full month before FS had told me I need to pay $3k per month to continue. I was heart broken, but got married shortly after &amp; started FS again. Then a month later, my financial aid was declined &amp; had to stop again. I gave up.\n\nUntil recently my wife suggested I try again. Now that I have three kids, I think that helped my financial aid lol. I\u2019m essentially going for free now.",

I think the whole financial aid thing is stupid like I'm on my own and I'm paying for school. I'm honestly heartbroken not to be dramatic, but it's whatever. I was a little disappointed that I don't qualify for any scholarships from FS until I've had someone apply for the parent plus loan. They really should say that on the website. \n\nI'll be able to file independently next year so I'll just have to wait. By then I'll probably give up though \ud83d\ude02",

Of course people at the school I've been talking to are always going to have something positive to say so I figured I'd ask a student opinion.

I keep in contact with my financial advisor weekly...sending followup emails with almost the same response every week: something like \"we are working on it and we'll let you know\" \nAm I overreacting to think this is taking too long? It's been 67 days since fullsail received my FAFSA renewal",

Just be sure to keep bugging them, and keep in mind that this is a weird time of the year (what with all the holidays and most FAFSA being submitted at the start of the year).",

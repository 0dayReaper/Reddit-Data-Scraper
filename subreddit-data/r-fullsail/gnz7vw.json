    "postText": "I\u2019m an online student in the graphic design program. I\u2019ve been in school since September, and my first six months were great. Flash forward to me starting my actual graphic design classes and all of the sudden my professors didn\u2019t seem to care, and even got defensive with me when I politely inquired about grades. Since then I\u2019ve lost most of my motivation to do my work. I still make sure everything\u2019s done and am a 4.0 student. However, my reason in making this post is because I\u2019m wondering if anyone else has experienced this or if this is \u201cjust how it is\u201d from here out. I never receive any personal feedback about my work and if I do it\u2019s something like \u201cgreat job.\u201d I understand and am grateful to still be doing so well, however again...this has cause me to lose almost all of my motivation. I was homeschooled for ten years and I thought Full Sail was going to be different, but quite frankly it\u2019s become homeschooling. I seriously am starting to feel that online students aren\u2019t respected at all - especially by campus/online professors. I\u2019m sick of receiving copy and paste feedback. How am I supposed to know what I\u2019m doing right with my work and what could be better? I guess I\u2019ll find out after I\u2019m $50,000 in debt. I guess for now I\u2019ll just keep filling out the course evaluations even though they\u2019re probably meaningless.",

            "comment": "Yes!! I\u2019m also a student in graphic design, and I\u2019ve had a couple professors who made me want to quit on the spot. I\u2019ve gotten angry over the simple and short comments or when they just grade your projects, but don\u2019t critique anything. I\u2019ve had a few great teachers who worked with me on improving my work, gave helpful feedback, and who I loved learning from, but I\u2019ve lost my passion for this career at this point. The last teacher I had was rude, and would just say he didn\u2019t like what I did or would give me a mediocre grade just because. My GPA has been 3.9 since the beginning, and I\u2019ve been great about turning in work on time, keeping up with discussion boards, working hard, etc, but I\u2019m kind of over it. Just knowing how much money I\u2019ll owe at the end of this, and knowing how I feel now...it just doesn\u2019t seem worth it. I\u2019ve also heard from other alumni\u2019s while searching the internet and they seem to recommend not going to full sail online for graphic design because you\u2019re better off learning everything from tutorials and hands on learning in an internship. I\u2019m a hands on learner so I think they are correct in my case, and I\u2019d rather withdraw now then graduate in 2021 and regret it while having to pay back so much debt.\n\nAlso, the evaluations are 100% meaningless and so is reporting a teacher. I reported one for unfair grading after I had accidentally submitted the wrong file on something as part of my final project. He took two and a half weeks to get back to me, and as soon as he told me I only submitted half, I screenshot the finished work to show it was actually done, and I submitted the other file with an apology, and instead of him grading it, he ignored me and left my grade for it at 50%. I was furious. I had worked sooo long on that assignment, and was so proud with what I had accomplished. Every teacher before that one was good about simple mistakes and as long as I could prove I had done the work, I was fine. This one was just rude and procrastinated every grading assignment. I tried reaching out to complain and they had me fill out something about it, but that was it. I never got the grade for it, and never heard anything else about the incident.",

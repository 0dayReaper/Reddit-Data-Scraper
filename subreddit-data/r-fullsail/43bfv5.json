    "postText": "I'm a new Full Sail student working on a degree for creative writing. In my spare time, I've been working on a free form script for a horror movie and I've shown it to a few people already. There are some visual effects that I have in mind that would somewhat push the envelope when I write them down, but that's not the question. What I really want to know if anyone would be interested in seeing the script and if so, do you have any ideas on how certain effects can be pulled off?\n\nThe bulk of it, since it is a pet project without a future yet, is based off of the SCP (Secure, Contain, Protect) Wiki and lore. So far, with the 33 pages invested, the real horror or fear aspect has been subtle. Dashes of foreshadowing, setting up devices, rising action - rising action - rising action.\n\nMessage me if you're interested! Thank you and have a wonderful day!",

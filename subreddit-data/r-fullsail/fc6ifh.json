    "postText": "So I\u2019m from Michigan State Uni (sophomore) and I\u2019m trying to transfer colleges to learn more about 3D animation. While doing my research I\u2019ve found Full Sail and I\u2019m seeing a lot of reviews either saying it trash/scam or it\u2019s a great university. I know that Full Sail courses is rigorous but is it rigorous because it\u2019s good or is it rigorous becasue it\u2019s program is on a tight schedule? How successful is their 3D animation program? Are their professors and networking good? Am I better off going to a different University? The more I read about Full Sail the more I\u2019m conflicted about whether or not I should attend here. Any advice or input would help. Thank you!",

They provide everything that you're going to need in your endeavor. From my understanding, a lot of the controversy around the university is based on the fact it's a private school that doesn't completely adhere to the standards of the state, and it's expensive. It's rigorous because it's both (IMO) good at teaching course curriculum and that it's on a tight timeline. The industry expects exacting deadlines and specifications to be met. FSU prepares you for this reality by testing your commitment and resolve by pushing your predisposed expectations. I look at it like this, how many alumni are pursuing their passion because of this university? How many names are in the credits of projects? So far, for me, I see the benefit of the cost, and it's worth it. The main question you need to ask yourself is, are you willing to give your everything to succeed?\n\nEdit: After your content with your research, and after you compile some specific questions, call the advisors. They'll help you determine whether or not FSU will be the right fit for your future.\n\nEdit 2: I remembered this post from a few months ago that inspired me. Hopefully, it will give you some insight. [Inspiration](https://www.reddit.com/r/fullsail/comments/dlnklf/should_i_really_enroll/f4t2xh0?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)",

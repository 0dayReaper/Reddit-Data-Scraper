Dont need crazy info but perhaps just the software and ideal of what we actually will be doing in this class. Any info is appreciate thank you in advance.",

The proper answer to this question is it depends on when you will be taking it. We update the curriculum for that class often. However, at the current time Maya is not part of the curriculum, although it once was. The focus is on DirectX currently. It has a companion class later in the curriculum where we teach Unreal for programmers and depending on when you take 3DCC some of that content may have moved into it.\"",

They told me the same 25-30, but I've not encountered a class that I couldn't do the homework for the week in a single day.  One class so far took me 12 hours for the weeks work, but the rest have been under 8.  My biggest frustration is that most classes so far don't allow me to work ahead.",

I would say the work is less than 25-30 but being that we\u2019re only doing \u2018busy work\u2019 I can finish most work before the Deadline (I\u2019m doing Online and our deadline is Sunday at 11:59pm) \n\nSo I\u2019m hoping that once I get past the probation month I\u2019ll see more interesting classes.",

Once you get into the real course material it will vary class to class and on your personal comfort level with the material.\n\nFor instance, for somebody who has never coded before, Programming One would require a lot of effort even tho the material is really easy for those who are already familiar with C#. Like wise for Software Engineering. The difficulty ramps up as you get deeper, and they expect you to be putting in equivalent time to stay current.",

When applying did you come into any issues? I have heard that employers put full sail degrees on the bottom of the stack. Thanks for any help!\n",

            "comment": "So this kind of goes for every degree program. Full Sail Has been around a while, and is obviously pretty expensive, there for a TON of people that go to Full Sail are pretty wealthy and are just going to school to appease there parents (or whatever), ans theres also a lot of students who go there because it looks fun (it is) and easy (It isnt). You can totally go through school doing the bare minimum and not really absorb all the information and pass with some Cs. Then, those C people start going after jobs, they get the job with an impressive portfolio or maybe a connection. Then they walk around like their in charge of the place and expect to be working above the line jobs when they can barely hold the entry level one. It happens, but is not the majority. Because of years of this and the school being well known it gets a bad rep, but I have never met anyone who has gotten passed over for a job because of it. As long as your modest and know what you are doing this shouldn't effect your career at all. In the world of entertainment people will hire you for two reasons 1. They like you 2. Their friend likes you. Your connections will get you in, your knowledge will keep you there. ",

            "comment": "Its really about connections, you have to be making a lot while at school. Some people just coast thru and that's fine, but they are the ones not working in this industry out of school. You have to work on other projects become friends with the teachers, help out and network when you can. If this isn't a true passion I wouldn't recommend. Also tuition if you can afford and it wont put you in a lot of debt go for it if its your dream. I don't think its worth it if you will be taking out loan after loan. So many of my classmates were in serious debt and the film career path isn't a get rich quick path.\n\nFrom my class of about 40 I think 4 are actually working in the industry. Those 4 were the ones who had the personality for this industry and went above and beyond. ",

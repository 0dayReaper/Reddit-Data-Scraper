            "comment": "I graduated from the Software Development program (now Computer Science) and attended from Oct 2017 - Dec 2019 **in person**.\n\nThe program was amazing, with a few caveats. I had prior programming experience but not much. \n\nI learned an incredible amount from relational databases, low level systems programming, TCP/UDP socket programming, a variety of programming languages, and a lot more.\n\nIt is very important to make it clear: CS/SWE is a field where, especially at the entry level, you have to grind and put forth a large effort to land your first job.\n\nI put in way more effort than needed in all of my project classes. A lot of the people I worked with did not. Most of them don't seem to be doing as well as I am. \"You can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink\". Full Sail provides the framework for success. If you do the bare minimum you will still probably graduate, but you will have a hell of a time breaking into the industry.\n\nAs for me, in the past 3 years since graduating, I have had 2 great jobs as a Software Engineer. In 2023 I should break 200k w2 wage. I live in Texas (medium-ish cost of living) and just bought a house.\n\nThe curriculum was light on web based technologies. So while I learned about TCP and UDP socket programming in C++, they didn't really cover HTTP nor any real backend technologies. I work with distributed systems primarily, so I would recommend learning Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, AWS (ECS/EC2/ALB/S3/Dynamo) if that piques your interest.\n\nPay attention in your classes.  The instructors are there to help you reach your goal, which is to graduate and have a successful career. I have heard some of the staff retired.  If Rodney still teaches DSA you are golden. A lot of the instructors like Justin and Chuck are one of a kind. I was super lucky that many of my classes were just me or me and a couple of other students.\n\nI would recommend if you attend that you focus on projects and interview preparation (leetcode).  I had a few good projects that I could discuss in length about technical challenges and solutions and I think that helped me get my first job out of school.",

Rodney\u2019s class is one of your most critical. \n\nI\u2019ll add a few more: \n\nPurchase a copy of \u201cCracking the coding Interview\u201d.  \n\nPractice out of class, I\u2019d add learning about distributed systems and popular container tech to the list. \n\nGet exposure to multiple languages. Go, Rust, JavaScript, etc are handy to have as they\u2019re often resume filters",

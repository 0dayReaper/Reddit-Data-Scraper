    "postText": "Intro:\n\nI signed up to the game development course, starting june 28, or aug 2nd of 2021. That gives me 9 to 10 months time to prepare basic skills knowledge. I have outlined the focus of my prep but still have some questions.\n\nFirst, i need to do the math evaluation. Is the math test a like a pre drop out test, or just a placement test to sign me up for the classes they think i need?\n\n\nConcerns\n\nProgramming, proficiency at a program language before school isn\u2019t a concern of mine. Creating code to achieve a desired output is just a logic problem thats easy to address.\n\nThe thing for me that trips me up is addressing software, IDEs, API, connecting all the stuff that goes into making an App, because its not a problem that can be solved with logic, its just knowing what button to click and getting used to things. For example, how am i supposed to know that creating a blank c++ project will need the project linker changed from console setting to a window app setting to make a WinApi window. Not know simple thing like that is going to crush my cram times.\n\n\nPrep strategy\n\nMy preparation will involve creating a basic window app, that can run c# sharp code, executes, xmal interface, access data in a spreadsheet. Just exploring how all this stuff can connect, and certainly familiarizing myself with the nuances of software functionality.\n\nWith that said, what languages and systems does the game development course use.\n\nC#\nC++\n.NET framework?\nWinApi?\nDirectx Or Opengl?\nMaybe DLL\nWhat spreadsheets are used?\nAny more?\n\nWhat can i expect to use when i begin developing at full sail?",

Surely my life situation will impede my commitment to my studies, especially for a school, from what I\u2019ve read, has a 75% drop out rate.\n\nI would prefer to go in with as much prior knowledge as possible because i know exactly how wild the ride is going to be, being that my wife and I are both full time students.",

The course load takes a fair amount of commitment from you, and support from your family. I get home at 6pm on days I work, and I usually will spend 3-4 hours on classwork. This means I either eat dinner at my desk, or scarf down a quick meal with the family before I get back to it. On my off days, i do my best to wake up early and get school out of the way so I have time for the family. The first 4 months are kind of general courses, one a month unless they put you in the math prep courses then you will have 2 courses for months 2 and 3. \n\nAll in all, they don't expect much from prior knowledge, but it helps alot if you have some. From what I have seen, Game Dev works in C# using Unity for the game engine and Visual Studio for the code editor. Math, if you have at least an understanding of Calculus you will be fine, but if you can learn quick then the math prep courses are good enough to get you up to speed.",

Their courses are not free, but they have them on sale perpetually and you can find them on Udemy for even cheaper sometimes. They also have a math for programming course that runs from basic addition/subtraction all the way to basic calculus. Very helpful. If you score below a 70(I think, it could be 75) on the math evaluation, they will put you in a Pre-Calculus and Calculus course during your first 3 months to prepare you for Discrete Mathmatics in month 4.",

I wonder if thats accurate. Career wise its not major dream of mine to work at some major company on someone else\u2019s game. But if i did, i think working on the engine would be the most challenging, satisfying and rewarding part. Which is why im not in game design.\n\nIt would be interesting to compare the full sail comp. science degree to the game development degree to see how they differ.\n\nIll keep the ball unity project in mind.",

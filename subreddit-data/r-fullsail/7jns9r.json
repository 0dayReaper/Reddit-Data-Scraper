I still use it and have 7 now. \n\nbut even after 12 years Reason still stymies me in its editing sequencer. \n\nin protools i can do anything in seconds. \n\njust curious, thanks. ",

I would much rather spend some dough to have reason totally mastred back and forth in a few onths than stumble around for two years. \n\nreason is such an indepth program, i have been using it as an instrument with rap musicians as a rewire in PT since 2.5 and PT 5.3. \n\nthanks for your input, i feel like im rambling.

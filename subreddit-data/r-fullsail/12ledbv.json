All information, thus, is private. No student login? No directory. Those of us with logins can see it perfectly fine.   \n2) Using a *state-funded school* as a reference when talking about a *private school* is not how one properly cites a source. You should have learned that in High School. \n\nAs a full-time campus student, *Full Sail may not be the school for you.*",

I graduated....well, probably before you were born.\n\nI did not provide a \"reference.\" I showed you the directory from my University, where I work.  A real University.\n\nI am accustomed to being able to locate offices and staff in any University, and any faculty member from any University (or any member of the public) can easily find my contact information.\n\nThe idea is that a University wants to facilitate communication between its offices and professional staff with offices and professional staff from other Universities.\n\nSometimes professionals like me want to be able to contact other professionals at other institutions.  The idea that one would need to log in to see a directory is bizarre.\n\nMany things about Full Sail seem bizarre.",

However, I\u2019m also a transfer student and it\u2019s definitely worth noting that they accept almost no transfer credits as a for profit school. I think that with my 2 years of school outside of FS, they accepted only 2 classes as transfer credit. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend testing out of some classes in your first two weeks of school. They don\u2019t tell you about this, I only found out about it months into my schooling and they said it has to be done in your first two weeks. There\u2019s a lot of basic classes that you should be able to test out of easily.",

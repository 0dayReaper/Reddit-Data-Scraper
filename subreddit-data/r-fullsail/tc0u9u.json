    "postText": "I know its provided but is it essential to use adobe final cut pro from when I have used it vs Davnci Resolve has been miles ahead with ease of use. so I'm wondering if assignments require you to specifically do certain things in adobe creative cloud that i couldn't just do in final cut and only really use after effects",

I would certainly prefer using my Aputure gear and own set of lenses. I also have an Adobe CC subscription and Resolve Studio. Although I do use Premiere for some things, I still prefer to grade in Resolve.",

I also used my LED panels because their lights kept blowing the bulbs and I bought the same exact ones they provided so I got fed up. But you probably will get away with it more once you're further into the program.",

DaVinci was highly referenced as being especially useful in color correction so they definitely said if you won't use it for anything else, color correction is what you should do with it.",

Early assignments have you use premiere and upload a screenshot of the timeline, but that\u2019s really to make sure that people in the program know how to use any editing software. They want you to use the provided camera but I\u2019ve had classmates ask about other cameras they own of similar quality or better and the answer has always been yes. They don\u2019t tell you that you have to buy better gear but if you decide to invest in stuff they are fine with it. \n\nMost of the time they are grading for specific things like shot types and did you get enough coverage.  I bought a DJI Air S2 drone and used it for my latest school project, and my professor really loved the shot I got out of it. I\u2019ve also bought lights because they are easier to use than the launch box kit but it\u2019s more about the final look more than it is how you got it.",

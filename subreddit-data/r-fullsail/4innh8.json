    "postText": "I have a bachelors degree but I'm looking to further my education at Full Sail, likely with the Internet Marketing certificate and then the Entertainment Business masters. \n\nI was hoping to not only get some insight on those two programs, but also just people's experience with online programs in general. I work nearly full time at Disney which is why the online degree appealed to me, but at the same time I'm nervous because I've never done anything like it. \n\nAny information would be super helpful! Thank you!",

Their website for online classes is top notch and all of my instructors have been helpful/easy to get ahold of. The only limiting factor is my own willpower. It's very easy to get behind if I let myself get off track.",

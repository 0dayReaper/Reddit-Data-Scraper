At the end of next week, my project Launchbox is expected to arrive. I'll try to post a general summary at the end of each month detailing my experience in this course.",

The launch box now gives you an MSI Raider GE instead of a MacBook. I don\u2019t know the specs but I\u2019m curious to see what you guys get. I don\u2019t start until the end of June because my work is sending me to take some classes for our machines.",

I have a HUGE passion for teaching the mass children via 3-D Arts and hope to gain a career doing such... I am curious as to how this certificate program is going for you. Best Regards from a fellow newb classmate!",

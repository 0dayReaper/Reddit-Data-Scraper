I really just want to learn everything i can about mixing and mastering music, with all the effects and leveling and EQ\u2019s balance. all of that and one day hopefully have my own studio",

It should be pretty obvious that the Audio Production is better if you want to do mixing and mastering. I think there's only one mixing and mastering course in Music Production.\n\nNot familiar with the Recording Arts degree.",

Im a musician and i know about recording and writing music a little, just all of ky tracks sound like crap cause i dont know how to lix it right. I definitely want to be surrounded by music as a job, and want to help produce, and mix for other musicians including myself.\n\nAn advisor told me that the music production would be better but im so confused on what a \u201cProducer\u201d is vs \u201cEngineer\u201d. I don\u2019t necessarily want to MAKE music but i do want a better understanding of music to help write and create a perfectly balanced mix for albums and songs",

A Producer role has a bit more going on, in terms of input in the creation of the music and overseeing the process. I am not familiar with Full Sail\u2019s particular curriculum for either programs and I don\u2019t want to sway you either way, but I do think that having experience mixing (audio engineering) would be beneficial for either route.",

I\u2019m currently in Music Production and it\u2019s a lot of theory and learning major scales and music composition. There aren\u2019t a lot of mixing and mastering classes, which is why I\u2019m thinking about changing programs to Audio Production so I can have a more well-rounded education of recording music. Audio Production is more focused on mixing and mastering, with elements of sound design for games, film, and tv. Based on your goals, it sounds like the way to go! Good luck on your journey.\n\nBy the way, Recording Arts and Audio Production are basically the same degrees; Recording Arts is on campus only and Audio Production is online only.",

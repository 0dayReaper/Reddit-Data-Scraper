    "postText": "Hey guys! I am looking for masters programs and earned my BS from LA Film. I recently applied to ASU(Arizona State University) and was denied due to LA Film bring nationally accredited but not regionally     Which basically means my degree is useless unless I go to a technical school for my masters or start over with a different college for a new BS/BA. \n\nAnyone a graduate of Full Sail\u2019s Masters programs? I\u2019m considering their marketing masters program however after this whole fiasco with LA Film I want to play the field and research both sides and find what would work best for me. \n\nI appreciate all honesty thanks!",

            "comment": "I did my masters in Entertainment Biz after getting a BS in Music Biz at full sail. I would say it goes by fast and I got thrown into online classes only about 4 months into my program and we just resumed partial in class classes towards the end (graduated in November). I will say if you can get involved in clubs and other full sail things (there\u2019s always a project that could need help if you know how to network) then the masters is a great step for getting an education and getting some good experience under your belt. The online classes though, eh. Some professors just talked for 3-4 hours without any breaks and a lot of my classmates (I had about 6 or 7) didn\u2019t really talk in our zoom classes. Once our in class stuff resumed though it was a lot better and easier to pay attention and get some conversation started. Post graduation side, in Orlando, FL where the school is based they have a good reputation and I got a job about 2 months after my graduation. Granted it\u2019s in social media and content production so not my exact entertainment job I was looking for but a great start for my career. If you are looking to go into the entertainment biz then full sail does hold weight but make SURE you\u2019re getting experience while in full sail to back up the degree when it comes to job searches. Hope this helps!",

I haven\u2019t had much luck with the degree out here in the Bay Area (San Francisco). However when I was earning the degree I was living in Los Angeles and worked for Cirque Du Soliel, CBS Radio, Illusion Industries and a ton of different film productions. I\u2019m considering getting my masters at Full Sail in Digital Marketing but I\u2019m skeptical.",

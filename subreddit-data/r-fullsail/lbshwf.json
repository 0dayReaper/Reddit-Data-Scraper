            "comment": "I think for the most part it\u2019s just kind of an estimate system.  For a normal college workload which is like 8 weeks, 1 credit hour would be the equivalent of around 5 hours of class time per week.  Our courses are only 4 weeks.  So for a 4 credit course it may be an expectation of 20 hours of study per week.  But, like I said, I think it\u2019s just an estimate system. \nAnd then it depends on your familiarity with the subject.  For example, in the Computer Animation Online Bachelor program, I\u2019ve completed the first 5 courses so far.  The first 4, or the \u201ccore 4\u201d I heard them refer to it as, were all subjects that I had a good familiarity with in my past schooling and with the lectures, personal study time and the assignments I probably spent 8-12 hours a week working on my schooling.  Then month 5 was a course I had no previous experience in, 3D Foundations, and I spent 30-50 hours each week working on everything.  It was a big jump.  \nSo, going forward, I aim to reserve 30-50 hours per week to work on everything.  Month 6, my new course, Fundamentals of Art I, looks to be relatively easy subject manner, however, there are a ton of assignments each week.  I expect to spend a similar amount of time working on stuff throughout the month.  \nI just recommend expecting a lot of schooling hours if you take any of the Full Sail programs.  And consider it a good thing.  If you\u2019re really trying to learn and develop skills, it takes a lot of time.  If you\u2019re just interested in earning a paper that says you went to school, then I recommend finding an easier program elsewhere.  But, if you find something easier, you\u2019re likely not gaining the necessary skills and knowledge that will make you successful in your chosen career path.",

            "comment": "So, at a normal college, 1 credit hour means 1-3 hours of work a week. Depending anyway (that\u2019s how it is where I live). I am not sure as to how it is with full sail yet. Expect it to be at least 3-5 or more hours a week. If you\u2019re an online student like me, it might be more as we only do one class for my program each month.",

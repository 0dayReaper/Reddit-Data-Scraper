            "comment": "Apologies that is is late, but I am currently a senior student in comp animation online. \n\nIn case you haven't commited yet: This degree is not easy. It is by no means impossible though, especially if you love computer animation in itself. I find my motivation challenged a LOT, but I'm finally getting into classes where they teach the really fun stuff. For the record, I have a full-time job along with this full-time schedule, and I've easily been able to maintain a 3.2 GPA even with a couple of motivational collapses at times. \n\nAgain, I love this stuff. You will be given your own macbook, scanner, wacom tablet (and a quite large one, too), as well included softwares of Zbrush, Autodesk Master Suite, and Adobe Master Collection. I've had a few complaints, but overall they dwarf other colleges at preparing you professionally for the job market than any both the other two colleges (UAH and Calhoun Community College) I've gone to for similar degrees by far.\n\nWarning: Don't attend if you feel you might want to take your degree elsewhere, as this is a specialized program with no semesters off, and practically zero of the classes are transferable. However, you get your bachelor's in just 2.5 years, and many large corporations like SAIC love looking for Full Sail Students, as they are produced in quality.\n\nGood luck, and let me know if you have any additional questions.",

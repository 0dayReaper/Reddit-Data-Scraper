            "comment": "Full Sail's housing department has a roommate list. Its not too great because you get put on it by default so there's a lot of people not actually looking for rooms. But if your willing to but in the time you can find someone starting soom. The nice part is they also give you a list of people already there who have rooms available and other students starting at the same time. \n\nHonestly the best tool I have found is Facebook. [FS Trade Center](https://m.facebook.com/groups/152880714916076?group_view_referrer=profile_browser) and [UCF subleasing page](https://m.facebook.com/groups/564117110587539?ref=bookmarks) are good places for finding roommates.

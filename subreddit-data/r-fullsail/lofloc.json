While I was doing on campus at schools in my area prior to coming to full sail I found flexible hour jobs. That\u2019s mainly retail, fast food and the like in my area. Sometimes companies will offer a position to students needing a flexible schedule that\u2019s in their area of study. So I\u2019d start looking around to see if any companies will do that.",

            "comment": "Most people that choose to find work while attending on-campus lectures tend to look for jobs with really flexible work hours. The minimum wage in FL is only (as of last month) $8.65/hour, with a plan in motion to increase it by $1.00 each year until 2026. You'll see a decent handful of folks that *know what they want* and can manage a full-time job while also juggling Full Sail classes (takes a lot of cooperation between student advisor and you), but they're a pretty rare breed.\n\nI'm in the majority, though. Military vet, tuition &amp; living expenses covered. The majority of students on campus are either veterans, immediate family members of veterans who passed down their Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits, or the occasional student with well-off parents. Depending on your degree program, it gets pretty brutal at closer to the end of your first year. I definitely would have struggled to even work part time during that amount of coursework.\n\nEDIT: I don't mean to say this to discourage you, I hope it didn't.. I'm just saying, if you're planning on really giving it your all and networking/making friends, then it's going to be really disheartening that you'll likely miss out on a lot of those opportunities due to cramming homework inbetween lectures and your job.",

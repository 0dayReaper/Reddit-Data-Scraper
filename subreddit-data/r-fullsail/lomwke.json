The way 3DF is presented has a lot of gaps so people who are absolutely new to the equipment and softwares will struggle. I remember watching the lectures and going \"Wait how did he just do that?\" and then rewinding over and over again until I realized it was never fully explained and I needed to go to the Lab. 2 hour assignments were becoming 8-10 hour assignments easy. It gets a little better going forward as different instructors have different teaching styles and Foundations is a lot to take in at once. Good luck.",

I feel that was my issue. Talk to your classmates as well! If worst comes to worse, talk to an adviser about grade forgiveness",

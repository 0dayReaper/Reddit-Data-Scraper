    "postText": "I'm a Online comp science student at full sail and im scheduled to receive my laptop next month. I've spoken to 2 different Full sail technical support specialists about what specific model I would be receiving. I was told by 1 of them that it was the MSI GE76 11UH with a 3080 and was told by another specialist that I would be recieving the MSI GE78 with a 4070 both via the online support tickets. Any current comp sci students know what model they are receiving? This is really confusing\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5hhcbj8z635b1.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=80fbec19efc600f35136ee2ca45fecf5ec064af8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sa0fmk8z635b1.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2640a926571cedb4b6caaaed9172cba7555eca71",

Technical support is not really the most helpful unless you\u2019re talking to them about apple products, so just keep that in mind. But I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re receiving the first option. I\u2019m MS in game design new graduate from BFA creative writing.",

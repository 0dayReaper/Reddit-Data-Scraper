    "postText": "I've been going to full sail since July of last year. I'm an Audio Production BS student and I get straight A's but the class I'm in now has gotten a little harder and I feel like its just gonna continue to get harder as I progress through the program. But I want to work that way I can get my own place before I graduate. I have an interview with a work from home company next week and just want to know if I should cancel the interview. Has anyone here worked full time while attending full sail online? If so what was your experience?",

            "comment": "I am a Computer Science Online student, and I work around 50 hours, sometimes more a week. It is incredibly hard. I have a wife and 2 kids, and there are many days that I barely see them. My family is asleep when I go to work at 5:30am, and I don't get home until around 6:30pm. When I get home, it is straight to the desk and I am doing school work. I often eat dinner alone at my desk. \n\nI am currently in Month 9. It requires a level of dedication that is not easy to maintain. Any sort of slacking can result in falling behind very quickly.",

It\u2019s a lot of dedication, and since you go for two years straight without really getting full breaks (one week in the spring, one week in the summer, and two weeks at Christmas), the burnout is very real. \n\nI found myself 15 and 16 months in and nearly ready to drop out, but I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. The connections and mentors you\u2019ll find along the way are worth it.",

The first bit was around 40 hours, halfway through I had to get two jobs and so I worked 65 hours, and then the last 6 months of school I dropped down to 50 hours. It's definitely doable but I'd recommend putting time aside for your health (both physical and mental) as much as possible. I pushed through but it was incredibly hard and I definitely felt burnt out for a few months after I graduated to be completely honest\n\nEdit to add it REALLY sucked on the months that I had two classes or a major film project. It was difficult to fit everything in and was incredibly stressful",

I did this and am continuing to do this whilst working 50+ hours a week and I have a wife and kid as well. It\u2019s possible. It just boils down to time management!

I\u2019ve talked to admissions and they make it sound wonderful, but I want to know the students perspective. I\u2019ve seen people shit on full sail, but I want to know others opinions first before making a decision. Does the programs prepare you for a job? Is the tuition worth it for what they offer? Are there scholarship opportunities that make this school affordable? And how is their financial aid packages? I appreciate anyone who replies and gives me their opinion.",

            "comment": "I'm currently attending on-line for the computer animation bachelors, and it all depends. For me it fits because I'm making a drastic career change and need the degree. As well I don't have 4 years+ to do it. Also, I have already been doing it as an on and off hobby for a very long time. So, it works for me. I get a degree, and time to build my demo.  \n\n\nBasically everything you hear from people, and the school is true. The good and the bad.  EXCEPT no one will laugh at you, or not respect you for having gone to Full Sail, and if they do they're idiots. No one actually cares where you went to school, or if your grades were good. All anyone really cares about is your demo/portfolio, and some require a degree. No matter what school you go to you will have to put in the work to get the job. I know some people in the industry and they all say these same things.   \n\n\nIf you're just coming out of high school, or in your early 20's I would say go to a more traditional school. Reason being is there you will have professors, and teachers. Not instructors. My biggest complaint is the presentation of the material makes it clearly obvious that much of the time your instructor knows little about teaching. This is not to say they don't know what they are doing. Everyone I have had has been very knowledgeable in the subject at hand. However, there is a huge difference between knowing something and being able to teach it. I can't speak for on campus so I don't know if it is any different in that regard.  \n\n\nI think Full Sail is better suited to those that already have some chops. For example the first class where we used photoshop they flat out say \"This is not a class on how to use photoshop. Here's a link\" then direct you to the tutorials on Full Sails website, or LinkedIn Learning. Sorry I can't recall exactly I've been using photoshop since the early 90's so I never clicked the link. Sounds a bit cold, and raw, but I kind of get it. There is ZERO hand holding. Doesn't mean I agree with it. To me that is bad teaching, but I do understand the position.  \n\n\nIf you have the time don't rush, and DON'T FEEL PRESURED. Look at all your options, and pick the one that best suits the life you want to have. Above all, going to school should be a boon not a hindrance to your future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck!  \n\n\n  \nP.s. As far as scholarships all the info I have is on their website. Any specific questions you need to talk to an advisor, or whatever. I'm just an idiot on the internet like everyone else.",

I will definitely take some more time looking at other colleges, it\u2019s just been a bit difficult as I\u2019ve been bad at researching colleges that have a 3D modeling program and not just 3D animation. I have spoken to their admission and asked them questions, but I wanted to know the view of the students who went there. Thank you again! It was nice to hear what professors were like for online classes and I was thinking of taking online. I want to know what I\u2019m getting myself into before dedicating my money and time into it.",

You might have to work on your specialization, modeling in your case, on your own. This is not to say it's not taught I just don't know any programs that specifically focus on only modeling.\n\nIt's a tough feild to pick a school for. Esp when the schools don't really know anything about it. You tell someone in enrollment \"I want to be a marine biologist!\" and off you go. But if you tell them \"I want to be a character rigger for ILM\" All you get are blank stares.",

It was the first time I was actually excited about school every day and I still use all of the skills I learned in 1999 as a foundation for my current careers in music and photography. \nI was driven to learn as much as I could and that's what made the difference between me and my classmates that struggled with the classload, financial commitment, personal pet peeves, or whatever. It's always what you make of it and you'll get hired on your personality and skill level... with the degree just representing that you are somewhat knowledgeable and that you follow though on long term goals. \n\nI'm not sure how the school is structured anymore but I'm guessing they still use all the best industry equipment, you make amazingly creative friends, potentially build a great network, and you learn a ton of cool new stuff. It's sounds way more expensive then it was back then but it only went up to associates degrees in '99 and was still super pricey. Best of luck choosing....you get what you make of it and the hustle always falls back on ourselves.",

It seemed like they had a good program for it when I talked to admissions, but I kind of took it with a grain of salt as they\u2019re basically a marketing team lol. I\u2019m also glad to hear this one positive. It\u2019s hard to make a decision on this school as I hear two sides of it, some ppl say it\u2019s bad and other say it\u2019s good, and you just have to grinds. Second one makes sense cuz everything needs hard work to work towards one goals and make the best out of a situation. By the way, thank you very much for sharing your experience!",

To start I'd say that financially it's a bit scary and it's a lot of work, so unless you know that you are passionate about what you're going there for I wouldn't go. \nHowever if you are passionate about your course and ready to bust your ass putting out work it can pay off really well and lead to some great opportunities.",

            "comment": "I would say the most frustrating thing about this school in the past 16 months, are the few \u201cprofessors\u201d who take no time to help, but instead say \u201cgoogle it\u201d. Full Sail University is a For Profit, Private school. So when I enrolled, I imagined I was getting industry professionals to teach me. When instead, most professors are students who graduated a few years prior, and now teach.\n\nMy issue with \u201cgoogle it\u201d is that fits the narrative perfectly for a typical school with no direct degree plan. This is a For Profit, and the teachers are supposed to be very knowledgeable, so I am paying for that knowledge. Everyone here wants to know what the professionals know, and if \u201cgoogle it\u201d is how these professors teach, than the school has no merit to exist. They preach about a book, Animators Survival Guide, in that book, Richard Williams talks about his lack of education in Animating. Did he just \u201cgoogle it\u201d? Or in his day, sit at a library and read through books and newspapers? NO! He HIRED he industry geniuses, and while they \u201cworked for him\u201d he studied UNDER them. Maybe that is why they say it is an under-standing to know something.\n\nThis is a good school, I would not say great, there are in fact a lot of lazy teachers. Like when they give you files, but they are labeled for campus students. Minor thing, but with the cost of the school, you would expect disciplined professionals. Not clowns who say \u201cgoogle it\u201d, but it is okay, write their names down as industry clowns and move forward with your degree plan! There are more great teachers who spend countless hours in after hour zoom classes to assist you than there are industry clowns!\n\nCheers friend and good luck!\nThis was simply my perspective of the school, and remember we all have varying opinions!",

I\u2019d hate it if a professor told me to google something tho, but if there\u2019s more professors who will take their time to help after class then it sounds worth it to me.

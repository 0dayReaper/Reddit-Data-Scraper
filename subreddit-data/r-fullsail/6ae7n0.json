    "postText": "Hi all. So I recently found out that my friend is going to attend Full Sail for her MFA in Film this fall. As someone who is going to a two year MA program in History, I don't mean to be rude but I seem skeptical about the one year for an MFA in Film thing. \n\nDoes anyone have anymore information about the program or school itself? I just want to be able to talk to her about it and the transition to graduate school, but I'd like to hear some people's opinions on the matter. ",

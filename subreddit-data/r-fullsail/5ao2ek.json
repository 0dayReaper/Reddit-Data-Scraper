            "comment": "FAFSA. Get any sort of grants/financial aid you can, as it will help with tuition. You'll probably need your parent's income/tax returns/monetary info for it as well. Most colleges will run you through this on campus, but if you're going online, you'll have to do this on your own. \nhttps://fafsa.ed.gov/\n\nYou'll probably have to get a loan as well. There are federal loans done by the government, and private loans. I've only dealt with fed loans, personally. A buddy of mine got a loan from Sally Mae, a private loan company, and I know he had to start paying the loan immediately when school started. Fed loans will not make you pay until six months post-graduation. (Though they will always recommend paying earlier so your interest doesn't increase on it.)\n\nI knew a couple people who did payment plans for colleges other than FSU, and they said it was horrible (paying $100+ a month for classes). I would try and avoid that, as I don't know what your monetary standing is, and it is easier to just go to school without paying out of pocket.\n\nLastly, just call FSU for help if you really need it. Being a current student, I've only had the greatest of help when I ask for it from them. Everything from financial, curriculum, and general questions have been answered pretty well. ",

Also one thing I already like about Full Sail is how interactive they are with students, so I will definitely give them a call. But just one more question, do you know if they will get back to you on the application? Like will they send some confirmation back? ",

Sadly, you will have to go back and forth between Admissions and Financial Aid about a few things, since they don't have each other's info (Admissions can't see much more than FAFSA status, Financial doesn't really know if you're missing anything for the application).

(I believe the Business students had to go to a certain number of workshops a month for class credit.)\n\nThere were always workshops, events, and opportunities available if you want to spend more time on campus, which I highly recommend. Get the most out of the experience with the time that you have.",

I\u2019m only 3 months in so I\u2019m just getting started but that\u2019s been my experience so far",

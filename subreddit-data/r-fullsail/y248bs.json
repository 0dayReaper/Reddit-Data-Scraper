    "postText": "Context: I am a Recording Arts BA student and Im a year in to my program.   \n\n\nWhen I decided to come down here to Full Sail a year ago, I have also been a guitar player and rock/metal artist for a few years  at this point. I believed that I would be coming to a thriving hub of creativity and music. In fact, one of my goals when coming down here was to join a band within the first few months.\n\nIts year two and I still haven't joined a band. In fact, I haven't been able to find any of the creativity or musical renaissance I was looking for and was even promised to the recruiters I talked to. Quite literally EVERYONE down here is a rapper/hip hop artist, or just not interested in music in general. Granted, I did find a lot of talent outside of FS in the Orange County area, but almost none of that I found in Full Sail, and this has made me feel nothing more than anger, or at the very least, utter contempt for the school community as a whole.   \n\n\nAm I in the wrong place? Is there something else I need to be doing? I know its technically not a performing arts/music school but I thought I would find a ton of more musicians to play with and potentially start a gigging band with: and yes, I have been looking. Now I feel just as alone as I did when I left home. Laugh at me all you want, but I cant help feeling what I feel.",

            "comment": "It does sound like your expectations were not aligned with the school. I don\u2019t know what you were sold, but Full Sail is ultimately a vocational school, teaching technical trades. Not a music school. I think your anger and contempt are misplaced, and could also be barriers to your goals. You say you have found other musicians in the area, this is the path you need to follow. \n\nHave you reached out to Artist Relations at all? They used to be the group that schedules all the bands and solo musicians for labs. Dale used to run the department, and is/was a gigging drummer. Find a couple more local players and start doing labs together. Even if you\u2019re just doing some covers, maybe that will help get your creative juices flowing again.",

I know friends outside of school who have booked some time.\n\nI guess I didn't go for music school because 1. I cant really get a job with it and 2. I know I can just work on music theory on my own, no degree needed. The only thing I would want from that is the ability to network with other musicians, which I thought I could find here. \n\nI just cant help but feel I've gone absolutely nowhere during the year. I feel alone.",

If you're already 1 year into the program, my suggestion is make the best of it and maybe shift your short term goals just a bit to help your long term. Perhaps you can just try networking with your professors and other students. Even if their genre doesn't align with you, perhaps their story will and they can help you along to achieve your long term goal. Why are you at Full Sail? What do you aim to achieve with your degree? Odds are another student or even professor shares your same goals. Just don't give up! Learn as much as you can then apply it!",

I have gotten quite a bit of experience with both at Full Sail, as I have been interning at a studio and I've been playing almost 3-5 open mics a week, with paid gigs sprinkled in. Its not much money, but its a start.",

It's a wildly successful genre in music and rightly so has inspired a lot of people to pursue careers in it. It also has a lot of benefits to solo artists with little formal training or education in instruments or musical theory. The tools available to create all forms of electronic music are incredibly accessible, many even for free. And unlike something like a traditional rock band, coordination and creative cohesion with other musicians is not a requirement.",

I don\u2019t think your missing anything, I think your expectations are just too high.  We know nothing is ever delivered to our doorstep, you have to grind and work and think outside the box.  If things were that easy, everyone would be thriving.  Network, get to know the area, and people who can assist you in what you are trying to achieve.  Frustration just causes doubt and delay, so remain positive and get out there and get what you want.  Yes, that area or Florida does have a high number of rapper/hip hop artists, but that\u2019s not the only music that gets work there.",

I do agree that everyone wants to be the next mainstream rapper and it can make what you\u2019re looking for feel quite impossible, but these ppl do exist. Maybe advertise yourself like they do and you\u2019ll find them.",

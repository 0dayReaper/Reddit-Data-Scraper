    "postText": "I recently started the graphic design bachelor's degree program with Full Sail in August. I have some questions that haven't directly been answered and since it's the holiday weekend I won't be able to get answered until Tuesday. \n\nI'm attending Full Sail online and I'm qualified for the momentum scholarship, do you have to pay that back or is that a free money situation??\n\nAre there any graduates of the graphic design program who struggled to get jobs? And what's your opinion of the program in general?\n\nI've been burned by a for profit school before and I'm really not willing to make a $60,000 mistake. The graduation rates I've found are conflicting and there's that accsc issue. I'm just really hoping for some honest opinions and advice. Thank you!",

I've been able to get in contact on weekends throughout my degree, I called a few hours ago for help with something, *and* had class at 9 AM this (Saturday) morning.\n2. Every scholarship is free money, that's what \"scholarship\" means.\n3. I'm not in your program but there's a weird misconception that a degree from Fullsail and good grades will guarantee you a job. You'll struggle just as much as everyone else to get a job, but if you have good grades, Fullsail is a generally respected organisation in many industries.\n4. There is no accreditation issue, this is a misconception that's going around because people can't read. Graduation rates are very low, but that's pretty normal for a competitive university environment. Throughout my degree every one of my classes has been being divided by two each month, people drop out.\n\nAre you gonna make it? Only you know that. If you have what it takes to succeed then yeah, you'll probably have a long and successful career after graduation. If you try to just get by, you won't.",

I'm doing this for me and I want to succeed. \nI got spooked this afternoon when a friend asked me about the scholarship specifically and I didn't have the answer. \n\nI think people get scared off by the low graduation rate because people try the school thinking that it'll be easy and it's definitely not. I looked at the school 10 years ago for game design and opted out of it because it looked too challenging. Especially with its accelerated design.\n\nThank you! I appreciate your honest opinion.",

It only impacts some degree programs at the accreditation level but it is 100% a concern University wide  considering it would impact Full Sail\u2019s ability to receive Federal funding if the accreditors pull the accreditation (unlikely but possible). Here is the warning letter the school has recently received from the accrediting body https://www.accsc.org/UploadedDocuments/2022/Public-Notice/Redacted-Letters/Full-Sail-University-055214-SAL-Warning-Letter.pdf",

Don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll help but oh well. Once you get into the actual design classes it\u2019s gets better in my opinion. You\u2019ll join slack and have almost direct access to teachers and other students on there and a lot of the teachers will give you their number to reach them and will specify if they\u2019re okay with calls or texts or both. \n\nI do believe there was an accreditation issue but it\u2019s for the game art and design degree programs and it\u2019s over the graduation rates for those courses.

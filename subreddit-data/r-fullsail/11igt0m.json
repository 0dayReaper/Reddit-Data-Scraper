I like taking my time to learn the concepts but from the sounds of it I'm gonna have stuff pounded in my head faster than I'd like. Not to mention if you tell someone you have a web development degree I've heard it's nothing more than a joke",

I flew through my IT certs I took last year so pacing can somewhat be handled for me. I just want to make sure that 65k is something I'll be able to justify in the end",

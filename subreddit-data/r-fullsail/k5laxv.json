    "postText": "Hey everyone. I'm thinking about going to Full Sail in order to get my Bachelors in Game DESIGN. I have been in contact with the school and am getting some things in order but I am not currently set in stone going there.\n\nI want to know if it's right for me, because everything sounds great so far. But I know that's kinda the point is for schools to make themselves look good so you spend your money there. I don't want to be deceived.\n\nI have a huge passion for gaming and I want to be the director and \"overseer\" of projects in the future. I am currently making my own game with a small group of friends of mine who I'm going to CC with currently, (but that's for Graphic Arts, and I'm graduating in 2 weeks) but I want to dive deeper into what it means to really design a game and make sure everything makes sense and ends up doing well. So I would have people doing development and I have someone doing Music already and people doing art and story writing. (We're using a different program already.) So basically I want to start my own studio.\n\nBut yeah, so this is more about me having the drive and wondering if going to Full Sail will help me put this drive into a more professional perspective to go along with my passion perspective.\n\nI don't have money to throw around, however I am eligible for financial aid and I will be asking them questions before I make the final decision.\n\nEdit: You guys are wonderful, thank you so much for your advice and replies. I really am thankful for it.",

I love my producer, he makes sure we talk to other departments, schedules our work out months in advance, makes sure we all are pushing toward a common goal.\n\nDesigning levels is a level designer, help story is a writer, and come up with ideas is kind of a director or designer, but there isnt really an idea guy, thats a made up position. There are designers that implement ideas with coding/engine work and come up with systems, but no body is just coming up with ideas.\n\nI recomend narrowing ur vision, just levels, or just writing, or just design, almost no one does all of these, MAYBE one person per game if that where as there are 6 writers and 4 level designers and 25 designers and 6 producers.",

Full Sail is crazy expensive, and I would not dish out that kind of money for an online version of it. I would 100% do in person, if you were to go. I went many years ago, so my perspective is vastly different. That said, I will say that Full Sail graduates default on their school loans almost four times that of a traditional college, so definitely make sure you are making the right decision. Also, in hindsight, I absolutely hated that the class schedule was accelerated. I much preferred going back to college and actually digesting my knowledge over the course of four years rather than having it rammed down my throat in one. I feel like I gained so much more. Ultimately, the career I have today is 100% attributed o my state university I attended and not Full Sail.",

People will share a lot more information and allow themselves to connect to a student or potential student than they would with a person looking for a job, right? \nFind individuals in the part of the field you want to do. Identify the sector, game is HUGE. Are you looking at producers, developers, or art? Find people in those positions. Many game studios will post their staff online and even emails on their site, or their emails are easy to suss out. Don't go for AAA crazy huge places like Blizzard. Find the medium sized outfits because they will be far more accessible. I've been able to walk on studio lots (film, not game) with this strategy, and it didn't take long. It just took some clever ideas to get past the receptionist/gate keepers to the person who can answer the questions I need. If you can say you are \"doing this for school\" or \"are very interested in learning more about the industry\"... whatever you need so they know you aren't asking for a job right now... the better.\nKey questions to ask: \nWhat does a &lt;&lt;job position&gt;&gt; do on the day-to-day?\nWhat degree do &lt;&lt;job position&gt;&gt; usually have?\nWhat repository/portfolio is needed for &lt;&lt; job position&gt;&gt;? \nDo you hire entry level or hire internal for that track of positions? \nWhat should I do to get started as a student?\n\nOnce you have reached a personable person who is willing to answer this... keep in touch with them occasionally as you go through whatever school.. and tah-dah.. you have a professional contact in a legit studio who could recommend you to be hired there or wherever they work when they change jobs.",

That is, sit in and go over the material again, and if something new has happened in the meantime in the industry, you can learn about it.\n\nI had a former classmate come in for some of my classes and she just wanted a refresher.\n\nI'd definitely make sure you have enough money for the course. It is accelerated meaning you're doing twice the work of a normal university and won't have time to work and study.\n\nI know people who tried, and it was very difficult to get jobs to work around their schedules and with classes being round the clock (yup, I had labs at 4am before) it's complicated organizing yourself.",

For one, I can learn on my own but I do need some instructions on the way. That is why I wanted to be in a class for Game design instead of learning on my own. Also having the accountability of test and project due dates also help me. The second reason was that I don\u2019t know anything about game design so idk where to start. I\u2019ve always loved playing games and also coming up with ideas that would make them better but I never knew how to actually do it. I am a person who can\u2019t make up there mind easily and reading every comment about the school doesn\u2019t help but I can\u2019t argue that there have been successful people from this school including several people that worked on borderlands 3 and credit their success to full sail.

            "comment": " \n\nCurrently in capstone for GD bachelors. What you probably want is either business management, or GDesign masters where they usually go over stuff for producers.  \n\n\nHere I\u2019ll go over my experience as GDB. I\u2019ll rant a bit, but that\u2019s just because of the \\~16-straight months of school is making me go insane. And I\u2019m prepping myself to spend another 11-hour day working on this project that hopefully the teacher will approve of.  \n\n\nIf you do the accelerated GD bachelors without breaks, it\u2019ll be like 6 months of easy, 6 months of a rollercoaster of difficulty since it\u2019s a range of skills they\u2019ll try to put you through, and the remaining 8 months I will recommend you actively try to not have any distractions outside of school (except for a month with a theory and a history course ezmoney). I can\u2019t stress how often I get classmates that get frustrated at their grade because they didn\u2019t spend enough time on it because of work, friends, family, relationship bs, etc.  \n\n\nAlthough, you can probably take my roadmap of difficulty with a grain of salt because apparently they changed every degree-specific class like the month after I took them to focus more on Unreal while still stuck with primarily Unity knowledge. Guess who\u2019ll have to audit a class or watch a ton of Unreal tutorials.  \n\n\nThe teachers don\u2019t give a flying fuck if you have work, the school warns you that you\u2019ll be doing a full-time job\u2019s worth of work. A part-time job will often not fully understand FS\u2019s scheduling and will easily fire you for having to attend all of your lectures.  \n\n\nTwo scenarios I came across:  \n\u201cI got a 60 on the project, I think I might actually fail.\u201d  \n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d  \n\u201cThey wanted it due the same day as my girlfriend\u2019s birthday.\u201d  \n\u201cDid you finish it before then so you could have time to celebrate?\u201d  \n\u201cWell, I was also working double shifts every day there wasn\u2019t a lecture. So I didn\u2019t really have time to do it.\u201d  \n\n\n\u201cYou got a 90?\u201d  \n\u201cYeah, I just did what the teacher asked. If I went above and beyond I could probably get a 95. Why did you get a 65?\u201d  \n\u201cI was bingeing League to practice for Armada tryouts.\u201d  \n\n\n(Armada is like high school football, except for nerds that are decent at competitive video games. I\u2019ve seen so many friends get held back by months because they\u2019re more caught up in Armada than the fucking degree they\u2019re paying for.)  \n\n\nI can only talk about my personal experience in GDesign bachelors. Yours may be VERY different depending on how many friends you make (and keep up with) and how often you brown-nose to alumni and staff. The teachers are people too, I hate to have a Karen-mentality of \u201cdeserving a grade\u201d, but some teachers have a hard-on for never giving people 100s because \u201cnothing\u2019s perfect\u201d. Others will say \u201cwe\u2019re here for a good time, not a long one\u201d and straight up give you minimal description of what they want from your work but a 3-page pdf of how to turn the shit in.  \n\n\nThe fact that the teachers work in the industry at the same time as teaching can be cool in theory, but anecdotally in practice it feels bad. Some physical classes you may find your teacher focusing heavily on their personal project instead of focusing on helping the students that didn\u2019t know they\u2019d be learning how to code.  \n\n\nIf you thought this program was just going to be theory, learning how to document and developing skills to work together with teammates. You\u2019re partially right.  \n\n\nDesigners need to know a fuck-ton of code or visual coding in order to know what they\u2019re talking about with Developers. Barely fucking touched communicating with Artists, but apparently that\u2019s common knowledge /s. I recommend making friends in both departments and keeping up with what their assignments are like.  \n\n\nYou won\u2019t be interacting with any Developers in projects that actually have coding in them unless you\u2019re doing stuff separate from school. You\u2019ll be in groups of just designers, some with a decent grasp of coding and a lot of people that don\u2019t and would require a traditional school\u2019s semester worth of time training to perform what is being asked of them in the later classes. I am not a teacher, but fuck me because in order to garner better friendships apparently you have to be 4 different types of character archetypes IRL for people to stop playing video games and take you seriously enough to work on the project.  \n\n\nIf all you care about in a class is a grade, get ready to be a pack-mule on steroids. Carrying a project where the expecting work of 6 students is actually coming from 2 is the most stressful bullshit I\u2019ve done. While it can help with actually becoming more proficient in coding, it makes school feel like a battle royale. I would have thought that by paying a fuck ton of money to enter a private university, I would get classmates that actually have a drive to learn and create something. As it turns out, people really only want a Game Design degree because it sounds cool. People don\u2019t want to do the work required to be good at what they\u2019re going to school for.\u00a0 If you start coming across this, notify the teacher that you\u2019re group isn\u2019t working out well and that whatever you\u2019re doing or try and motivate people is overbearing and making complications with your assignments progress. They\u2019ll probably do some bullshit where we\u2019d confront each other with these grievances, but honestly those people probably won\u2019t make it far into the industry and forming bubbling positive relationships with them shouldn\u2019t take priority.  \n\n\nRandomized teams are going to be the shittiest experience of your time at this school. Whenever you can, find like-minded people and request to leave whatever POS group you\u2019re in to form a new one with the people you know will actually work for their A like it\u2019s a paycheck. Something I finally figured out in Prototyping.  \n\n\nSwear to god, dedicated extroverts will shine in this degree. I\u2019m introverted, but my passion and work ethic will put me in a leadership position. I tried to be a second-in-command type, but every time the leaders will become fuck-all in quality by the second week. Be ready to actually have to lead, because while the school encourages everyone to be a leader, it\u2019s much more common that people want to be followers. I hate this mentality that you\u2019re either a leader or follower, but honestly that\u2019s just kinda how it be.  \n\n\nThe school\u2019s biggest draw is connecting with fellow students and alumni that are in the industry, although for the entire time I\u2019ve been here I haven\u2019t seen a physical panel with a GDesign alumni only GDevelopment. There can still be some cool people, but connecting with people that are already out there and constantly sharing your work via on social media could help.  \n\n\nIf you\u2019re deciding to do this on-campus, you better wish a fucking pandemic or an act of god doesn\u2019t hit the US or the campus while you\u2019re attending.  \n\n\nEveryone was transferred to using only the tools the online students had (Zoom, Discord, FSO, and Perforce), but in order to \u201cmake the on-campus experience worth it\u201d, teachers would attempt to make some assignments more difficult. So not only would you get MORE assignments, you get more complex instructions. While we were working on figuring out how to even tackle assignment 6, the online students were asking in discord for more clarification on the EXAMPLE of assignment 2.  \nFinally, to end off my rant.  \nThe school is only worth as much as you put into it. If you\u2019re wanting to make yourself stand out, you\u2019ll have to be the most charismatic, confident, and hardest working person in the room at almost all times.  \n\n\nAs an introvert that entered just wanting to follow people and make some friends that could help me in the future, I learned that you have to be the one that others will hope you help them into the industry. I\u2019ve had too many people only be confident and charismatic, but not have the work ethic or drive to better themselves and ending up failing.  \n\n\nAlso, hope you like Wendy\u2019s, McDonald\u2019s or FireHouse. Those\u2019ll be the places you\u2019ll be eating lunch or dinner from for the next 20-ish months.",

(mental disorders) So I already do full time school. But even still this was very very helpful and I really appreciate it! Thank you so much.",

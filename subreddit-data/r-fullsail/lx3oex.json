    "postText": "I'm currently contemplating attending FSU online for my bachelors in game dev. It's my passion, always has been but I've been out of school for a while now (I'm 25 currently) and as I've been doing a ton of research into FSU I looked at the curriculum and although I have been taking going back to school as seriously as possible (I've started to learn to code in C++ for about a week just in preparation for FSU's game dev course) my biggest concern is getting my brain used to things like discrete mathematics, linear algebra and physics. I am willing to push myself 110% but I guess my nerves are getting the best of me seeing as I've never touched those subjects in high school and now as an adult wanting to pursue higher education for my dream job it's just a bit nerve racking seeing and reading all the stories of people who have attended in the past and drop out because they don't take the work seriously enough or they have a hard time understanding the material being taught because of how fast they expect you to learn things. Feel as though I'm psyching myself out of what seems to be a great program for exactly what I want to learn. Also it's hard to get a good out of pocket cost for FSU if anyone wants to let me know feel free to him me in the pm's because I'm not sure how much financial aid will cover.",

            "comment": "So, for the math portion of your concern. I had the same exact issue. I got to Pre-Calc in High School, but I graduated back in 2011 and hadn't touched a math book since. I grabbed a few algebra books from Barnes and Noble, found a few free websites, and started studying. The great part here is, you don't HAVE to be ready for those classes to start this program. Here is how it works: \n\nYou are going to take a math assessment as part of your admission process. The test covers everything from basic algebra, geometry, Trigonometry, and college Calculus. YOU DO NOT NEED TO ACE THIS TEST. \n\nScores:\n\n70 and above: you will be accepted into the program with no changes to your schedule. \n\n30 to 69: you will be accepted into the program, and will take two Math Prep courses during Months 2 and 3. These will be in addition to the courses you are already scheduled for those Months. They are Pre-Calc and Calculus. \n\n0 to 29: you will not be accepted into the program. You will speak to an advisor about potentially taking the test again, or looking into another program. Most people who can't make the Math requirement go into Game Design.\n\nThese Prep classes are absolutely amazing. I took them, I got a 58 on my assessment going into the Comp Sci Online Program. The instructors are really good and they cover everything you need to know. The obvious catch, is that they are only 4 weeks long each. It will be a ton of information being passed to you very quickly, however every lecture is recorded and you can go back and rewatch them as many times as you need. Additionally, and they stress this, you are NOT TRYING TO BE A MATH MAJOR. They are only going to teach you what you need to know for Game Dev/Whatever Program you are going into. \n\nMy advice, is to study and take the test to see where you are. It doesn't hurt to see where you are before you make this decision final.\n\nHope this helps ya!",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve found that Full Sail caters all the classes to creative learning systems, and the Online programs were developed with full time working students in mind. Every core class I\u2019ve taken has had tutoring sessions available several times a day, a plethora of additional resources for struggling students, and readily available instructors who want to work with you if you want to. Also, my program (which is admittedly more creative than technical) ramped up the work. The core classes were simple with time requirement and concepts, and have steadily gotten more difficult. \n\nTypically, it\u2019s 3-4 credit hours a month which isn\u2019t to bad. During the later part of your degree, you might be taking up to 8 credit hours at once. Taking my first 7 credit hour block this month (two classes). We\u2019ll see how it goes!",

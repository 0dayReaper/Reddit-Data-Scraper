    "postText": "I already have degree on animation and want to study game art, i have thoughts about it like i am only taking the game art degree for some subjects like environment Art and game engines and all and many people said to me that taking another Bachler's is kinda waste.\nSo i only know python and i have no clue about game design like the coding part of it, i have few knowledge about game art and creating props and environment and using unreal engine.\nSo if i take game design will i able to grasp all the things? Or is it very unrelated to game art?\n\nAny advice will really help\nThank you",

            "comment": "The skills between computer animation and game art are very compatible and interchangeable. A lot of the fundamentals transfer and while there are differences in workflows, it should be pretty easy to pick up and understand. I personally would not go for another bachelors in game art if you have done computer animation. I would look into shorter courses in environment art if that\u2019s your interest. A lot of great ones out there. The game design course seems like the better option if you are set on going back to school. It will broaden your skill set and look better to employers, as opposed to having 2 very similar degrees.",

            "comment": "Apologies in advance for my long-winded response!I transferred out of Game Design BSC to Game Art BSC and I will say this- the entire learning experience here is catered towards someone that has *never touched* any of the programs that we use in our courses- there shouldn't be much concern for skill issue when completing assignments.I suspect that might be a different case for the Master's students- but that program in particular has changed a LOT in the last two years alone- and I'm just a tiny baby BSC student so idk about that stuff.\n\n1. Game Design focuses on the core elements of designing a game itself; not the *visual* elements, but the underlying systems that go into making the game... well, *a game.* Requires much more extensive math.\n2. Game *Art* is a different, more visual, beast- we focus very hard on \\*all\\* aspects of Game Art in the beginning. Hard surface modeling and sculpting. 2D Art is also an important part of our work. We're the guys that give a *face* so to speak to a Game Designer and Game Dev's work. You'll likely see some coding, but nowhere near as much as what you'll see in GDes and GDev. We also only have basic math requirements- they're far more worried about your work's visual quality than your ability to Math Real Gud.  \n\n\nSince you're already a 3D Animation graduate, you CAN transfer credits from a previous degree and finish the odd courses out and get your Game Art BSC quicker that way- but for most people it isn't that worth it. \n\nI would be more focused on asking yourself; *Am I more visually creative, or do I really like building underlying systems for games?* \\- i've known plenty of folks who've done both. One of the studio artists in the Modeling Dept. actually has a 3d Anim AND a Game Art degree, so it DOES have its benefits.",

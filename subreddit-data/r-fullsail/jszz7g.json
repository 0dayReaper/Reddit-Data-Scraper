Is anyone else in this program? \n\nWith the Cyber Security program you also get an associate degree in Information Technology. How is the Information Technology degree program? Does it prepare you well?",

Considering FullSail is know for Theater I\u2019m really interested on how known they will be in the CybSec community. Please keep this post active. You have gained my upvote.",

I already have an Associate's in Computer Information Systems so I wondered how this would apply to the Bachelor's. I'm in the early stages but I know InfoSec is what I want to do, so if you have any updates that'd be great. Thanks!",

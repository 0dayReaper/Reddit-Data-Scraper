    "postText": "Can anyone answer what feels like a naive question but I can\u2019t seem to find/get some basic information about it?\n\nIf during attending in-person, the program I am looking at has two classes per month. My questions are -\n\n#1. What is a typical time of day and days per week is each class is in session?\n\n#2. Do the two classes happen each day for the month? Or do they stagger/alternate the classes each week somehow or what exactly?\n\n#3. Is each class typically offered just once a day or are there often a couple from which to choose and assemble a more customized class grid for myself?\n\nI\u2019m trying to get an idea of when I would be expected to be attending on-campus classes so I can schedule anything/everything else that is not attendance related.",

Each week has its own tasks and assignments with their own due dates. I am in the Sportscasting Bachelor's program. Most classes so far have a live Zoom lecture once a week, at varying times. Being on the West coast and working full time, I am not able to join every live lecture, but they are recorded to allow viewing at your convenience. From my experience, viewing them live provides almost no benefit over viewing the recording. Otherwise, no real issue being on the west coast.\nAbout 6 months in and there isn't a ton of collaboration with peers, but there have been some opportunities and I believe that will develop as we get deeper into our program. There are Discord servers that have been good at facilitating some collab and discussion between students.",

            "comment": "1. It varies greatly. One month you could have a 9am-1pm class with a 1pm-5pm lab Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays (30 min lunchbreak between) , then the 2nd class would be M,W,F, etc etc..  Being on campus, they want you to treat it pretty much like a full-time job with a little overtime. If that sounds like too much, then there's an 'extended' on-campus option where it's one class per month. This is what I do because I live an hour and a half from campus and for the sake of my sanity I can't drive on I-4 every day. I know people like to say the drivers in their state are bad, but FL is getting worse every day. There's a reason every billboard you see 99% of the time is for a personal injury lawyer. My car was totaled in January from a hit &amp; run. :/ Lots of people out here are driving w/o a valid license and even more drive without insurance. ANYways.. I digress..\n2. Answered above, but they're typically staggered. You can contact 'Student Support' and work with them to figure out time slots that work best. In all honesty, though, the faculty are spread a bit thin at the moment so I'm not sure if they'd be able to accommodate.\n3. One to two classes per month and they all 'need' to be completed in sequential order (with a few exceptions here &amp; there depending on the situation). Most classes depend on the previous class's foundational knowledge (in my own experience.). \n\nI'm an on-campus Computer Animation student, graduating later this year. Let me know if you've got any other questions.",

Each day is typically devoted to one class and a lab for that class. Did I read that correctly?\n\nIn any case, what is NOT happening would be a schedule where you are taking one class for two weeks and then a new class starts for the other two weeks. They are taken concurrently for four weeks.\n\nThank you.",

One month we had a Monday and wednesday class/lab 5pm-1am and then right away had a Tuesday/Thursday class/lab 9am-5pm. Was not a fun month at all. Film students  have even crazier schedules. But you can not choose/assemble your class times. You might have some sway in the earlier months to do this as those are classes everyone takes so there are multiple classes for it. But for degree specific classes normally there is only 1 class a month for.",

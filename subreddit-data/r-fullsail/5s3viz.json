Are there any students currently in that program that could offer any opinions about it?  Also, would it be possible to do the online courses while having a job that eats up 30-40 hours a week? Thanks!",

Perhaps you should try and pursue a marketing degree from your state university(if it has strengths in business management &amp; marketing)? If not you could find a school that does assuming your GPA/Test scores meet the requirements?. Most firms are doing majority or solely online for their marketing dept. anyway so getting a degree in 'Internet Marketing' is redundant.",

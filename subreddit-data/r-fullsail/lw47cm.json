Recently, within the last 4 months, they switched the PC option to an MSI Raider GE. Even more recently, within the last month, they swapped Game Design to getting the PC option instead of the Mac. \n\nAs far as specs, the MSI laptop I received in Dec when I hit Month 4 Online, came with the following:\nIntel Core i7, not sure exactly which model because I never cared to look\nNvidia RTX 2080 Super\n16 gigs of RAM, not sure the speed\n2 SSDs, a 250gb boot drive and a 1tb storage drive.",

It's been a year, though, so the specs have most likely changed since then. When we were fully on-campus, though, they were quite nice. Much better than the MacBooks given to most others.",

Considering the VRAM, I'm surprised they haven't made this more standard over the MSI gaming laptop.",

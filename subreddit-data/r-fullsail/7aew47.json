    "postText": "Hi. I'm a nondriver (due to a disability) and live near the campus. I've been shelling out almost 400 dollars a month in Uber fare to get back and forth to class but I was hoping to see if I couldn't find someone nearby to either carpool to campus with me or to help me get back and forth. \n\nI intend to pay for gas and any inconvenience (I'm just attempting to save some money though, as I'm low income). \n\nWould anyone be interested or willing to assist? Is there a better place I should look for this sort of thing, as opposed to this subreddit? \n\n(Note: Before anyone says, yes I've tried public transportation options and they're horrible)",

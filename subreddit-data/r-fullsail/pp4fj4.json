I unfortunately don't have the direct extension for the academic advisors, but that number will work.\n\nEDIT: If you were hoping to e-mail them instead, most of the time I typically just send my concern to [studentsupport@fullsail.com](mailto:studentsupport@fullsail.com) and if it is a matter handled by a different department, they forward it to the best party.",

Please take this seriously and try to keep to it. \n\nIt's only as stressful and challenging as you let it be. If you're struggling to understand a concept or workflow,  then ask your classmates and proctor for more assistance. \n\nTake the time to do independent studies of whatever you're learning after completing the required work. \n\nThe school models its pace and communication methods after your chosen industry. So, follow the guidelines as set forth, be vigilant in your studies, and if you're beginning to struggle, speak out. Let someone know, and you'll receive help. Also, make sure to eat and sleep properly. The most significant cause of burnout is going all in without any pacing. \n\n\nI wish you the best of luck on your journey!",

The degree is designed for beginner programmers, but you are still choosing to learn a difficult subject in an accelerated degree program. It requires a lot of time and dedication, and any advantage you can give yourself will improve your chances for success.\n\nInstall Visual Studio Community Edition. Watch some YouTube videos. Get familiar with basic coding logic. Right now, the CSBS relies on C# and C++, which are good places to start, but really anything would be helpful. \n\nIf you have a library card, see if they offer LinkedIn Learning for free. If you don't have a library card, get one. Most of them do offer LinkedIn Learning and there are TONS of courses on there to learn everything from programming to video editing. They're not a replacement for a degree and hands-on training, but they are an excellent place to start.",

    "postText": "Initially when I was deciding about going to full sail I was told you get an iPad after month 1 and the rest of your launch box after completing month 4. I completed month 4 and only received a MacBook when I was supposed to receive a camera, tripod etc. After calling they then told me I won\u2019t receive the rest until after month 16. Which is next year\u2026 \n\nNormally I wouldn\u2019t care but I feel like I was lied to. \n\nMy degree program is Sports Media and Marketing.",

            "comment": "So what happens is they send you the supplies when it is fit for your course studies, meaning you won\u2019t be doing anything involving the camera until month 16.  I am half of a year in of my music production degree and have received all of my supplies and software.  It\u2019s always better to ask ahead of time. They won\u2019t lie to you.  I have never had an issue with communication with the school, they have been up front about everything including cost of school.  You can always switch degrees if you want to work more hands on, but being upset about not getting what is coming eventually seems like you just want the stuff to have for yourself.  I wish you the best of luck with your degree and hopefully we can work together at something!",

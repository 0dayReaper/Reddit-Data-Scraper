For example the M1 stuff brings compatibility into question with software like Autodesk Maya. Which is a non-starter for computer animation. So I could see them switching to Windows based laptop for that program. Though a lot could change in those 5 months and Autodesk could release a M1 native version and bobs your uncle.\n\nHowever I'm just an idiot on the internet making guesses. So I basically don't known sh*t. \n\nCall the school and ask. If you're doing game art or computer animation and you dont get a MBPro then consider yourself lucky.",

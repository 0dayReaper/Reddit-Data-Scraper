    "postText": "### If you think 80k+ is a lot then you'd hate to hear how much a public school costs where anyone can get into. A public school in the US for 1 year, including tuition and books comes to about 21,370 for in-state students (and that depends on if they provide the material the professor wants you to get, usually it's the newest edition that costs the most), 4 years of tuition and books, maybe possible room and board can total anywhere between 84k-90k+. The video game program is one of the most expensive program you can take at Full Sail, or any college at that. For Full Sail to be a for-profit school and still have tuition that is cheaper than going to a public college, this is actually pretty good. Because not only do they provide you with a tuition and books, they also provide you with essentials that most schools would not give you, basically handing you an extra leg to lean on while you study. The launchbox alone provides you with a laptop, ebooks, tutorial guides and many other material depending on the degree that you'd like to achieve. That launchbox is always improving, it never stays the same; as Full Sail tries their best to stay up to date with current changes in technology. The school is meant for hard working individuals. If you aren't willing to put in the work and effort in and out of school, then just like any other university that is high in demand. you're bound to fail. Which is the issue with many Full Sail attendees who end up dropping out. The main reason why there's a big drop out rate is because most people come in to the program thinking that it's going to be easy and simple. They take it as a walk in the park until they realize that there's more work into the career than they expected. Other reasons are due to financial and health related issues (This was me, as I attended and had to withdraw due to health related issues and finances, but even through all of that, I'm still willing to go back.)\n\n### In New York, the most expensive 4-year nonprofit university for 1 year is Columbia University in the City of New York with a bit of a breakdown of their academic year: \n\n### FEE\tCOST \n\n### Tuition\t$62,570 \n\n### Mandatory Fees\t$2,954 \n\n### Average Room and Board Cost\t$16,156 \n\n### Books and Personal Expenses\t$3,672 \n\n### Travel\tvaries \n\n### Total\t$85,352 + Travel \n\n### This is just their 2022\u20132023 academic year of nine months. For 9 months you're paying 85k+ and that does not include other expenses and fees, like their meal plan or orientation fees. Bringing the total up to about 100k+ to attend.  Considering that the highest degree at Full Sail is only 80-85k, this is nothing compared to what other colleges try to scrape out of your financial aid and other loans. If finances are an issue for you, if you aren't willing to put in the hard work, I would recommend you to reconsider going to any college or university. Because this is going to be the same scenario. Financial aid will help you of course, but that's to a certain extent. Some financial aid will be able to cover full tuition depending on the university/college that you attend, but that isn't for everyone. There are still living expenses and many other things that you need to get in order to have a good educational experience. Most people have to rely on getting loans, but most people who have graduated from these Universities and Colleges have also put in the hard work, because they are paying for these classes and they want that higher education. If you're only attending college because you're parents want you to go or you think that it's going to be all fun and games with beautiful rainbows and a pot of gold, I would sit back and think about if it's truly for you. If you enjoy that minimum wage job that overworks you, then by all means, more power to you. But achieving a higher education is costly, as much as it's costly, it's damn sure worth it to follow in that career path. Take this into account, make sure this is truly what you want to do. If it is, then move one foot forward at a time, plan accordingly and don't delay in your studies. By the time you graduate, you'll be on a successful career path. Don't let bad reviews of the school waiver in your decision making. The more you look into bad reviews, the more it's going to bring you down and make you reconsider. So take your time when choosing the college/ university. Because a lot of schools have a similar drop out rates and a mix of good/bad reviews.",

            "comment": "Okay, I'm not disagreeing with the broader point that the cost of Full Sail isn't significantly worse than other universities, but to include room &amp; board in the costs of attending Columbia but not include rent in the cost of attending Full Sail seems pretty unfair.\n\nVery few Full Sail students will be living for free (presumably with their parents). Some students will move to the Orlando area to attend, others will attend online but still need to pay rent/mortgages.\n\nThat's not counting the cost of groceries, transportation, etc. If a student isn't able to hold a job while attending Full Sail (which is more difficult to do given the accelerated programs), then we can assume they're taking student loans for the cost of tuition ($85k), rent ($700/mo = $17k for two years), and various other expenses, (say that's another $5k over two years on a frugal student budget). So you're looking at just shy of $110k. And those calculations are leaving of the last 8-ish months of the program.\n\nBad reviews should absolutely be a factor in deciding. Not saying they should weigh more heavily on decision-making than positive reviews, just that it's not advisable to ignore bad reviews entirely.\n\nFull Sail has pursued a very specific approach to teaching and that approach is **not** going to work for everyone. People should be considering a lot of factors as they're deciding on whether to attend college and which college to attend.",

                    "comment": "To be fair, you're right, I should have added the cost of living considering that room and board was included in their tuition but my post wasn't to consider cost of living but just tuition expenses alone. So I should have taken that part out of the costs for Columbia.  Rounding the budget and the cost of the meal plan provided from Columbia, you're averaging a 21k addition for the meal plan alone. Bringing the costs to a total of 100k+, or averaging 80-85k if you don't count cost of room and board, unless you opt out of the meal plan, which still tallies it up to 60-65k in tuition alone. Which ranges the costs to be about the same. But to be fair, I also didn't consider the cost of living expenses to the cost for public schools either, which would also amount to something similar, still depending on where you live. \n\nI didn't count most living expenses due to the fact that it would be different for everyone. Considering where you live, how frugal you are with your money and expenses needed over wanted. The cost of living in Orlando isn't cheap though, by far. For anyone trying to live close to the school as possible, the cost of living is a good 1200-1500 a month, most places don't include utilities either, which accumulates to about 200-250 a month. All of these are of course factors to take in, but again, I was merely accounting for the tuition base. \n\nYes, bad reviews should be considered, never meant for it to be taken as to disregard them entirely but taken with a grain of salt. Most reviews I've read about the school are just blatant resemblances of \"Don't attend this school.\", or \"Get out while you can.\", without getting into any detail about why. If you run across a review that goes into detail as to why you shouldn't attend, than yes, take that into account for your decision making, as you would with most reviews for other schools. \n\nFull Sail's approach to learning, if you take a good look at it, isn't that different from other schools. By far, it's pretty similar in academic studies. Review the material given, learn from the professors (if possible, really depends on the professor and how they teach.) and do more self learning on certain topics through resources you find on the internet or provided by the school. Most schools follow this curriculum, which begs me to question, what really makes Full Sail different than other colleges? The only thing I can truly think of is that they provide you with a launchbox which is by far, not cheap.",

                            "comment": "The primary difference in Full Sail's approach is that it is based on two key aspects:\n\nSpeed and Job Prep.\n\nThere's no arguing with the pace. This comes from, as I said in another comment, Full Sail being more akin to a technical/vocational school than a university. But unlike many vocational schools, Full Sail offers accredited degrees, which means students have to demonstrate competency in a handful of core subjects. Not everyone is going to be able to keep up with the pace. That's not to pass judgement on anyone, but simply to state a truth. Some students perform better under a more typical class pacing. Some students (like myself) perform better under a rigorous pace (this is what I get for spending 10 years working in a high-pace industry before attending college).\n\nAs for Job Prep, many traditional university degrees offer students the room and time to experiment, explore, and fuck around. Full Sail does not. Full Sail programs are here to teach you the industry tried-and-true methods, to get you prepared for what your employers will expect of you. You don't go to Full Sail to learn a wide variety of story structures. You learn the Hero's Journey and the 3 Act Structure because that's what has sold consistently for 50 years in the entertainment industry. Just one example. This isn't to say you can't learn unconventional things while you're at Full Sail, but you're doing that of your own initiative. That isn't a criticism. Full Sail is very clear about this approach. It is different than a typical university approach that offers (sometimes meager) challenges to convention at certain points in your studies.",

                    "comment": "I used 80k+ as a base of tuition, the highest tuition for a degree at Full Sail ranges to about 85k. Not jumping another 20k just because you believe it would. Most degrees don't even reach that high in Full Sail and average a range of 60-65k, still making it more affordable for a DEGREE total and not just based on a TUITION total. A degree takes on average 4 years, most schools have an average base tuition rate of 21k and that just for non-profit public schools that are on the cheap end. Making the total for a non-profit school without living expenses still at 80k+ for four years. So on average, Full Sail is just as cheap as it would be to get into a non-profit 4 year public college. Also remember that most public colleges don't provide you with the material needed for your classes, that means you have to pay for your books, a laptop if need be and any other materials. For most people who are attending a public college, 1 - 2 classes is the most they can muster as they also have to get a part time job to be able to pay the rest of their tuition off that isn't covered by financial aid. Full Sail has recently been noticed and recognized as a good academic school that you can get most of your tuition covered by financial aid. This was the scenario for me when I first started attending. The only thing I needed to pay for was the launchbox, that provided all of the resources, materials and equipment that most schools don't provide and isn't covered by financial aid.",

And the programs are designed to have you ready to plop into a career at the end. How effective they are at that is... Mostly up to the individual student, which is true for any technical college and traditional university.",

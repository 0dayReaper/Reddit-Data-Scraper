Pointers, vtables, etc take study and learning. There\u2019s a bunch of resources available. \n\nWhat part are you struggling with? Feel free to DM me, I can help.

No one knows code right away, I forget coding a lot of the time but the benefits of using it are tenfold the struggle of learning it. Imagine being able to make any kind of video game you want!",

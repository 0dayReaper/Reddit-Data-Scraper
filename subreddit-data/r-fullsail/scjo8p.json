There are discord servers set up for all the classes once you get to them, at least in the program I'm in, I can't speak for others but I have a feeling it's similar everywhere else. I started at the beginning of the pandemic so ALL students were online, and because of that I figured out by snooping around discord they are covering far more material with campus students in SOME classes, not all. I've had a couple where it's all the same stuff respectively.\n\nOver all it really depends. For me it's fine, I just wish there was more of an online community centered around it. I could however see how some might not like it at all.",

(Depending on your time zone this is a nightmare) or 2. Using poor links to a youtube playlist that has ALL of the classes past lecures on it. All I got was 15k in debt and shitty apple products.",

I deployed to Afghanistan for like 2 months...told everyone I wouldn't be able to attend cclasses. I come home and have been unenrolled from the school.

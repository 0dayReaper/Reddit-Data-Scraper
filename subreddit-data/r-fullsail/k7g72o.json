I went, got a degree, more importantly, more than $70k in debt, with no follow up, no help after graduation, and if you consider taking those classes again that they talk about? good luck. they changed the names of the classes and are trying to make you pay for it again. \n\nIf you want to do graphic design, do it yourself. find the work. watch more youtube videos than you're comfortable with. The information you need is found through experience, and full sail will not give it to you. They'll remind you that you'll be serving coffee as an intern while the instructors(that failed in the industry and came to full sail for a job) teach you everything but the tricks of the trade. \n\nToday, i still love audio/video/art/design, and i own and operate my own post production studio to moderate success(i make a comfortable living but i'm far from rolling in dough) \n\nI literally use so little of the information i learned at full sail i can't sit idly by while other people sign their finances away to a \"school\" like this.",

            "comment": "My two cents. Find one a state university that has a good graphic design program. For instance, in my hometown there is a university called Fort Hays State University. It has always had a very high reputable program for many years and many of my friends have went on to work at top ad agencies after graduating from there. It is a fraction of the cost you'd spend at Full Sail. It's not worth acquiring that kind of debt for a school that has a program that no one really knows about. Full Sail has a notorious reputation for being a diploma mill that accepts all applicants who apply. Unfortunately, I have found that they are not taken too seriously by employers. I dropped it from my resume years ago.",

If you are on a time contraint but want to give it everything you got whenevwr you can spare the chance to do so. Then boy-o this the place for you. But i fyou dont care for fasst pace and need to be able to work on your own time then a more traditional university might be your best bet, and if that is the case I honestly whole-heartidly recommend exploring community college options first and foremost. Its cheaper and generally all around more well rounded than popculture would have you believe.",

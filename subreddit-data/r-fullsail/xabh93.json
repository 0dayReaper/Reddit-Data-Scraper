    "postText": "I started the Game Development course awhile back, and was informed that I'd receive an iPad first and then the Launchbox shortly before my course-specific classes started. I got the iPad.\n\nWell, I was enrolled into Programming 1 and no laptop showed up, and I ended up having to drop out of the class because I had no computer that could handle the class (Visual Studio might not be a heavy program, but you'd be overestimating the capabilities of my laptop). I was reenrolled into it the next month, but still had no laptop, so failed it this time around because I tried to do the class instead of withdrawing for the month again.\n\nIs there a reason the Launchbox never arrived? I called a few times about it in late July but upon calling again, they showed no history that I had called about it. Now I've failed Programming 1 once and withdrawn once and am on the verge of withdrawing from the school because I have no way to do the coursework.\n\nAny advice is appreciated - I've been calling them fairly often, trying to figure out what to do, and I began enrolling in another school that offered a laptop for coursework, but I'd very much rather stay in Fullsail if possible - the accelerated rate of the school is ideal for me and the current job offers I have, which require me to finish a program ASAP for proper pay and benefits.",

The main thing is that I also just have no idea as to *when* I'm supposed to have gotten the Launchbox - there's so little information available about it other than \"You'll get this at some point,\" that I wasn't sure if I just wasn't far enough along in the course to qualify for it.  \n\n\nBut Programming 1 seems like a class that they would have sent it for, so it's definitely frustrating me because I do genuinely like the school and it could take me far, but the lack of a laptop or anything else is certainly getting on my nerves.",

It's not completely on you, but if you are noticing you haven't received contact or emails about it, you should be bugging the hell out of technical support. Technical Support has hours that are much later than most, if I recall. I'm not blaming you, but in life if you don't make sure it gets done, who will? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, always send a ticket through prior to calling too. You can do so from the FSO ticketing portal. I believe they use Zendesk, and it's setup automatically message you, letting you know that a ticket has been generated. When you can, screenshot all call records as proof of communication. They document everything, you need to do so too. I don't want to sound like a broken record here, but CYA \\~ Cover Your Ass. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you are able to get back into class soon, if that's what you want to do. Submit a ticket, and then call them. Wait 3 days. Respond to the ticket, it will add it back to the top of their queue. Then call them again for an update. Take a screen capture of each call, the number dialed, and the length of the convo, along with who you talked to, and when. Not having a computer is capable of doing the course is a fair reason to have failed it, honestly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA heads up of something you can use on your laptop you currently have; look into Shadow Gaming. They offer a virtualized computer for about 20.00 a month, that is as good or better then the laptop you will get. I used it when I was rebuilding my desktop, and it's fantastic. From my understanding they use a custom, in house made Hypervisor to bring you a high quality, low latency VM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I hope something in here was helpful.",

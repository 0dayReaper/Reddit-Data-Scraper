    "postText": "Hi, Prospective future student here. Looking for real thoughts and advice from people who went to or are currently going to the Game Design On Campus 20 Month Bachelor program at Full Sail. I am currently going through the admissions process and am planning on attending the On-Campus program in June 2021.  I just have a couple lingering questions and also would LOVE for some thoughts on the program itself.\n\nBackground on myself, I am 26 going on 27 year old male with a passion for gaming and technology. I have a beautiful wife and a child that just turned 1 a few months ago! Having worked in a sales job for years that I excelled in but made me feel unsatisfied made me finally take the plunge on doing something that I am actually very passionate about. Like I said, I am looking to start in June of 2021, and I am quitting my Full-Time job to fully focus on gaining the most out of the degree and HOPEFULLY getting a job right when the 20 months are up. \n\nI just would love some REAL thoughts on the Game Design program from current and past students.\n\nAlso a couple questions,\n\nHow hard was it to find a job after graduation? Also how was Full Sail in helping out with making connections for you?\n\nHonestly, what type of entry level job did you have after graduation?\n\nWhat are some skills that you learn within the course that can be applied to potential other jobs after graduation?(Have a child so would like to find a job soon after graduation)\n\nWould really love some thoughts from anybody with any insight. Thank you so much!",

            "comment": "I am currently enrolled in full sail and I would really advise against game design as a course when compared to the game development program. The extra courses you get in game design that you dont get in game dev are things like level design, progression systems, balance, etc but these are all things you learn through making games and can learn through watching the GDC VoDs as well.\n\nWhile game design gets you ready to design games, the game dev track more readily prepares you to actively make your own games, and the advanced focus in programming means you can make often more complex games to showcase more than your design colleagues can so even if you had more design knowledge theoretically, it doesn't do much if you can't program your complex designs when were talking about indie projects for your portfolio.\n\nAdditionally, many jobs treat game dev and game design degrees the same when hiring a game designer, however, if you try to enter a programming position at a studio, they will want a programming background most times. so if you get a game design degree you are kind of pigeon-holed into just game design while with game dev you have more options.\n\nLastly, game design has fierce competition. It may be easier to get a development position then transfer into design afteer. I know so many of my friends who went game design now out of luck because they cant find an opening and since there degree doesn't allow for many options finding other jobs is rough for them.",

The only skill that transferable that they received was programming but it\u2019s so basic programming that it doesn\u2019t meet a lot of requirements to get a software engineering position somewhere so getting other jobs outside of game design is rough.",

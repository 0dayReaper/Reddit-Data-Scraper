But if you\u2019re an alumni, unfortunately, Adobe stopped granting graduates an additional year\u2019s subscription last summer. It\u2019s annoying and inconvenient, but it\u2019s out of our hands \u2639\ufe0f",

But the system is set up so it\u2019ll only allow you to renew your subscription once your current one has expired. \n\nThat being said, we see a lot of students who got kicked out of the Adobe CC app after an automatic update and they sign back in under an Adobe ID other than the one they redeemed their code with, which will give them the impression their subscription has expired. \n\nIf you\u2019re unsure which of these situations you fall under, we can look up the exact date your subscription (current and past) is set to expire.

Based on the fact that you\u2019re about to graduate, your OTH was set up under your old student email address and apparently it can\u2019t be adjusted. This has been a huge source of confusion for everyone. ",

Took a few months break before looking for a job. Started looking at the beginning of 2020 and was employed by March. So took about 2 months of applying and interviewing. They definitely give you the knowledge you need to become successful. I will admit everything taught you can learn online uour self. But if you can\u2019t learn like that and need some form of organization or structure to your learning I would 100% recommend full sail . Your in and out in 20 months .",

            "comment": "I would strongly recommend against going to full sail for a relatively generic degree like that. Full Sail's strength is specialization and networking with industry professionals where it is hard to get in.\nComputer science jobs are widely available and going to a community college or state university would save tens of thousands of dollars and years of loan payments.",

Broad degrees can be had for cheaper anywhere. Unless the fast pace is what you absolutely need, I'd search elsewhere unless you're going for something specific that's hard to break into.",

They have some really good courses with WGU, and it's more aimed at what you're trying to do. I love Full Sail's concept and approach, but I don't feel it would be your best move for this. \n\nCheck if WGU, look at their Cybersecurity and Information Assurance course. It also offers a lot of certs through it. People knock the Comptia certs, but the government basically demands them if you want to get into that kind of work. No school can teach you to program, you don't have enough time in a class. I've taken classes on Java, Python, C++, and x86. \n\nYou can get a basic idea and understanding but it's like learning an alphabet. Just because you know some of the alphabet doesn't make you fluent. Take the course, abd learn a handful if the easier languages to learn, I would recommend starting with Python. Code academy helped me, I recommend it. Once you finish, pick something you want to make. \n\nI started making security tools, which is kind of common wolith Python. You learn a lot just by finding a tool that's already made and remaking it. Aiming to understand what ever line does, calls to, and imports. Once you have a basic understanding of a language and have played with it, take a look at project Odin. It goes through a variety of different languages and lessons to basically help you develop a portfolio to prove your ability. \n\nEventually you'll have to figure out what you want really focus on, and gear your learning to that. Database design? SQL. Security tools? Python, possibly some Pearl. Malewarw Anaylisis? You'll need to learn x86, and x86_64. \n\nJust dome ideas. My .02 cents anyway.",

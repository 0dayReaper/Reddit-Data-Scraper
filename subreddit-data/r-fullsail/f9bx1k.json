Make sure you dont talk to people JUST to make connections because then you arent being genuine. \n\nGo to any and all talks from grads and hall of famers you can so that you can get that real world knowledge. Experiences are what make and break careers so learn from other peoples mistakes and dont make them your own as much as you can.\n\nBe a decent human being. You know the term blackballed? Well if that happens to you at school you are SCREWED later on. Best thing you can do is be yourself and treat people like people.\n\nAs obvious as some of this sounds you'd be surprised how much some people just dont get it",

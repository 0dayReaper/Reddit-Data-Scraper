I really enjoyed the fullsail platform and format but the classes left a lot to be desired a lot of the stuff you have to teach yourself without a single mention of it in the class material.",

I would be doing the computer science program they offer and currently major in comp sci (concentration in software engineering) and I\u2019m about 40(ish) credits into the program at SNHU. Hearing that makes me feel like maybe sticking with what I\u2019m already doing would be more ideal though. Honestly, I haven\u2019t been able to find a lot of information on fullsail\u2019s computer science program so that\u2019s concerning. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to SNHU for anything tech there\u2019s actually a slack workspace (snhucoders.slack.com) that\u2019s super awesome, you just have to use your SNHU email to join. There\u2019s also one for cyber security and mathematics if you (or anyone else reading this) are interested.",

Yea I actually originally wanted to major in Game development, which is very similar to computer science but they didn\u2019t offer it online....The computer science is actually a new online program they just start two months ago...I tried to transfer into but out of my 64 credits they only wanted to let me transfer 16...so I laughed in there faces and transferred lol...",

So far I\u2019ve changed my major three times at SNHU (IT- web development, CS-Cyber security, CS- software engineering) as new degree programs were added and finally found my happy spot lol. Ive never had issues with the credits transferring.\n\nI honestly love SNHU, but there have been classes that either felt really easy, like there was little support from the instructor, or like the instructor had no idea what the hell was going on.. But maybe that\u2019s due to the online environment more than the program itself. Also, I can honestly say the longer the track is available the better it gets. Anyway, thanks for the info, hope you enjoy SNHU when classes get started!",

I had a balance still on my account so I wasn\u2019t able to immediately transfer my credits but when I did I was able to skip two classes, but one I had already taken by that point. I\u2019m in school for graphic design and it was a fairly easy process, and since I only had around 20 credits from SNHU, most being in liberal arts and writing, there wasn\u2019t a lot to transfer. It helped me get my MacBook faster though since I got to skip my last Core class so I\u2019m happy with the change. Feel free to message me with any questions!",

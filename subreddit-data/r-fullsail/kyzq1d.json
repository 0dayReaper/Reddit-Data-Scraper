    "postText": "Re learning math, getting ready for the entrance testing. I had to start over from basic arithmetic math (i.e. multiplication, division, etc.) If I understand a concept but still get a question wrong every now and then should I stay with the sub discipline until I 100% perfect it or just move on knowing that I understand how something needs to be done. I have ALOT of ground to cover so take that into consideration?",

If you score under 30% you should consider if you will enjoy the field, which is a valid question for Game Dev or Sim Viz.",

I start freaking out about 90 to 95 percents just because its basic stuff like adding fractions with uncommon denominators, but I'm sure if I push forward to something new that will get easier over time. Thanks!",

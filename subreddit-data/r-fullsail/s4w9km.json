    "postText": "So I recently changed from game art to game design due to how bad my art skills are. I\u2019ve been stressing on one day being a game artist for a gaming company for my future career with lack of art skills. So my question was do they also teach you art? Or do you jump right into things if you have art skills or knowledge ?",

I went through the game art program with many non artists, some of which are now happily employed aaa pro game artists. All you need is the drive to succeed and learn and you can make it work.",

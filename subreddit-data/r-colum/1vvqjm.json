    "postText": "I'm a transfer student starting for the spring semester and was wondering if anyone has attended any of Colum's social events.  They don't advertise many (besides Manfiest) and was wondering if anyone has gone to them.  Specifically I'm talking about events discreetly listed like ChicaGlow Party, Colum Block Party, Blood Ball, etc.\nThanks!",

I usually just look at the advertisements in the elevators, they're is a whole bunch of stuff. But being that it's winter there probably won't be anything till it starts warming up. \n\nBut like what mockingbird said, it won't hurt to go to parties that aren't affiliated with the school. It's Chicago, plenty of things to go to. \n\nI would definitely suggest the free Movie screenings though. If you get an email for a good one, go to it. I heard those are good events and the Q&amp;A's afterwords are usually good depending on who is doing it. ",

I've gone to quite a few, and it's a great way to meet other students who you might not meet otherwise. And if it turns out to be lame to you, then you can always leave - but I would recommend checking them out before completely writing them off, especially as an incoming student. \n\nWhen I transferred to Columbia, I went to a bunch of the social events and met most of my friends through them. Through that, you make the connections to find out about other parties unaffiliated with the school..so I say it ain't gonna hurt ya to check 'em out!",

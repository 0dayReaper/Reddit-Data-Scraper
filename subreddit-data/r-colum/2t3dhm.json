    "postText": "Hey fellow redditors, after slow painful grind of community college I'll be transferring for spring semester. and it feels good! I move in to the Dwight tomorrow, anyone know how it is? my housing contract is private bedroom-shared apartment but I have 4 roommates, including myself that's 5, the biggest layouts they have are 4 rooms so I hope were not all paying for private bedroom when 2 of us are going to be sharing. Anything I should do or sign up for (other than orientation and related stuff) after I'm moved in? Any advice for transfers (GD major BTW) looking for on-campus employment?\n\nDespite all my questions I just wanted to say Hi, Excited to spend my next two years in Chicago!",

I'm at the dwight now for the second year, but as an older student (read:not 18 and fresh out of HS) you're going to be frustrated quickly. It's a dry dorm and there's nothing really to do in terms of night life, so like after 11PM if you're not at a party wayyyy up north you're in bed.\n\nThe dwight is difficult to make friends in compared to the University Center or Plymouth, simply because everyone has private bedrooms and kitchens. You're more likely to meet people hanging out at the on campus placed to chill, 1104 as well as there's an underground cafe beneath 600 S Michigan that nobody knows about.\n\nHit me up if you're bored and want to play pool or something, have fun at Columbia.",

Ill use columbiaworks when I'm able to log in, the school seems to be taking their time setting my accounts up, good to know its a service that gets used. No not 18, actually 23 not expecting to meet many people my age in the dorms but you never know, thanks for your advice Ill take you up on a game of pool sometime or see you around in the secret basement cafe",

There are a lot of free events at the Conway center (first floor of the 1104 building) with free food.  Make the most of your upass.\n\nEdit: I became good friends with two of my roommates from the Dwight and we lived together off campus for two years after, so don't rule it out! If you need to toke inside, if that's your thing, make sure the shower is very steamy before you start. Got in a Lil trouble once ;)",

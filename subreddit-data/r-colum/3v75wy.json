How is the college experience? How are the schools connections to the industries? And how is Chicago, I've never been... \n",

Get a room to yourself and get it early. Nothing's worse than finding out the person you share a room with has a sleep schedule that's damn near the opposite of yours.",

It can be easy to coast depending on your major but if you push yourself to excel, people will notice and come to you with job/portfolio opportunities. \n\nMake sure to take advantage of the services Columbia offers like resume builders, tutors, and the portfolio/writing center. \n\nOne last thing. Back in 2010 when I was a senior in high school, the rep for Columbia came to my school and when I was talking to the dude he said \"if you can see yourself doing anything else, don't come to school here. Columbia is a place for people who know what field they want to study in.\" \nThat being said, pleanty of my friends have switched majors and are doing fine. ",

Otherwise, if u smoke cogs just hang out in front of the dorms smoking or classes smoking and strike up conversations. I am very open with my drug use (even in class, most teachers for my major don't give a fuck. Kids have weed stickers on their laptops and shit)  and ppl have approached me after or during class to smoke on break or if I needed a connect. \n\nAlso, grant Park after the sun goes down is filled with huddles of stoners. Mostly near the Metra tracks or by the big tree with the peace sign tagged on it just over the bridge on Harrison. \n\nTL:DR it won't be difficult. Don't be afraid to assume someone is a stoner based on how they dress or talk. It's so prevalent at Columbia that ppl generally won't get offended. ",

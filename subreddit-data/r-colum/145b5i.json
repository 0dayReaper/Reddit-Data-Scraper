    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm planning on transferring to Columbia from a community college. I'll have an associates degree, so basically 2 years worth of geneds. My question is - Most universities have gened/major classes split pretty equally so i'd be able to get a bachelors 2 years after transferring. Is that true of Columbia or is the requirement for GenEds smaller?",

            "comment": "I did something similar so the tl;dr answer is yes, you can probably get a bachelor's in two years.\n\nColumbia's college-wide program is pretty similar to other schools I've been to. One big exception is that instead of a foreign language they want you to take an elective that gives you an alternate perspective on the world. Most people take an American Studies-type class; I took Deaf Culture. (Highly recommended.) You can't really transfer credits into this requirement but you can always try if you think you've taken a class that qualifies. They have faculty to teach STEM and history but there's not a lot of emphasis on that stuff. It's the Arts/Film/TV/Journalism departments that seem to have all the students and money.\n\nSo as long as you've taken science+history+college math+speech and are bringing 50-60 credits with you, you're probably good. What level of classes you start in your major depends on your prior experience and your program of course. Welcome aboard. \n",

            "comment": "I transferred to Columbia from a community college as well. If all of your credits transfer, your AA degree will probably cover almost all of the GenEd requirements. I'd estimate that you might have to take maybe two GenEd classes. The rest depends on your major. If you're expecting to enroll 15 credit hours a semester, it's reasonable to plan on two years for a bachelor's degree. ",

I enjoy the class and we basically watch two episodes of the Simpsons (sometimes family guy and south park) each class session. There is some reading and paper work involved but overall its a great class to try sometime while at Columbia.",

I still took it and it really helped me see colors and the way they interact with each other much differently. There were photographers, graphic designers, illustrators and maybe a few other majors taking that class. It was pretty relaxed and the teacher (Jay Wolke) encouraged us to work in our respective mediums or try different styles. A good art oriented elective I'd say.\n\n* Also on a side note, freshman year I signed up late and ended up having to pick from scraps for classes. Ended up taking an Intro to Dj class that was a good time. One of those electives that won't teach you anything important but it was a good break from the normal classes in the middle of the week. Not that the kids weren't completely douchey or anything but it was fun.\n\nDoing my best to contribute. ",

Not sure if what's there now is his work or not, but I assume so. He lets you explore deeper into your prefered medium, but also introduces you to ones you may have never tried before. As someone who mainly uses Adobe programs, working with ink was something I never thought I'd like.",

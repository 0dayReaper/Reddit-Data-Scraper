Just wondering, If I do my two years at a CC, will I still be able to get the networking experience and social aspects of Columbia? Or are those 2 years too crucial? I really want to go here for the full four yrs but I don't think I can afford it. Thank you for your time.",

            "comment": "It's really a hard question to answer without knowing more about what you want. I'm from Dallas, I attended Colum all four years originally as an acting major, and switched to directing. I spent a lot of money. I met a lot of people. The people that have helped me the most since graduating and are my best networking peers and educators are those I worked with in my last two years. \n\n\nThe reasons why I would suggest go all four year. It allows you time to tailor your elective theatre classes to what you want, they offer a lot, like Stage Combat (which I was big into), make-up, technical classes (especially if your going into that side and don't know exactly what focus you want), accents/dialects, body, etc. You meet a lot of people early on, and you will grow with the peers, and learn and gain the trust from the educators early on so you can start doing more in and out of school sooner. It gives you a buffer to learn how much out side of class your willing to do. Because make no mistake. If you go to Columbia and want to learn and network and really develop your craft, 90% of that will be out side of the class room. And frankly the more you do, the more you know and learn. With all of the shows they do every year, it's stupid to not utilize that experience. The people I know that will be success are the people that put countless hours into the shows they were directing, or acting, or designing for, outside of class. Columbia doesn't spoon feed you. \n\n\nThat being said, I met a LOT of transfers, and almost all of the transfers I personally know, are just as amazing, and hardworking, and talented as those I started with in my first year. In fact Columbia is such an enormous school, with a very open admissions policy that 80% of the people I met freshman and sophomore year went to do something else, dropped out, or didn't work hard and graduated but didn't learn anything or keep relationships with anybody. This is especially for acting majors, but I think in rings true for the rest of the theatre majors.\n\n\nSo what it comes down to is you, will you be ready and confident in two years to work hard meet people quickly and throw yourself in full steam ahead when you decide to attend Colum. Because if you do, absolutely wait two years, it's a whole lot of money and a whole lot of bullshit. For me I needed the four years to figure out what I wanted, especially from Colum. Because, again, at least in the theatre classes, their isn't really school spirit, I don't give two shits about the school, it's the teachers that I met that gave a shit about me, and allowed me to work hard and push myself. \n\n\nI apologize for the rant, but I think it's a bigger decision to make, than to just hear two or three opinions, from people who are probably totally different than you and had and will have totally different experiences than you. \nBest of Luck.",

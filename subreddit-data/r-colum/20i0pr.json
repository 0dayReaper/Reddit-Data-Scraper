    "postText": "Hey folks,\n\nI will be starting classes in the Summer for my ASL - English Interpreting degree and am in need of a place to live.\n\nIdeally, I'm looking for somewhere to live before April 1st.\n\nI am a weird dude, but courteous and socially conscious. I have a collection of mustards that may or may not take up a little bit of the fridge.\n\nI am learning how to play a shaker instrument called the [asalatos (or kashakas w/e you like)] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq1GT0OHuqg).\n\nI'm a gamer and have dumped some money into my pc to play things like starcraft, counterstrike, hearthstone, and the ever infamous and unreleased goat simulator.\n\nI'm also an alien from another world.\n\n(only 3 of these 4 facts are indeed facts).\n\nI work at the GrubHub international call center and sometimes have pretty strange hours. The schedules change frequently though. My current schedule has me getting home at 2:30am. My next one will have me getting home at Midnight or so.\n\nAbove all, I'm a chill guy and would like to meet some columbia people. I'll even share my mustards with you. Dijon? Honey Mustard? Horseradish? Pick your poison.",

I cant help with the apartment hunting, but wanted to say \"hi!\" Good luck with the hunt!\n\nEdit: check out the sidebar on /r/chicago, there should be an apartment hunting resource there, or do a search in the sub!",

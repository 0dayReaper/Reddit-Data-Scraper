    "postText": "Hi folks! \n\nI signed up for a History of Chicago class in spring 2006, and the professor was supposed to be Bob (Robert) Arnoldt. He never showed, and we eventually got a new professor. At the time it seemed like he did a runner, and I can find no mention of him since. \n\nIt's been a constant source of curiosity. Any news? Was he found? Any details would be welcome.",

    "postText": "My first choice was Barnard College but I've been put on the waiting list there, and I need to look into some other choices. There aren't really many colleges that have such late admissions (I applied only to Barnard because of financial reasons) and even fewer that have playwriting, or even theater. Would you guys consider it to be a good school? Do any of you have experience with the playwriting program or theater? Is Chicago a good city to live and study in?",

            "comment": "I do think it's a good school. There are upsides and downsides, but at the end of the day, I think the non-selective admissions and a faculty of people who are mostly not career academics makes it a great environment to invent yourself. That said I don't rub shoulders with the art-school side of Columbia much. All I can tell you is what I was told when I was considering coming here, and found out the hard way: make sure they have your shit together. The administration can be a little hard to deal with. The upside is nobody will ignore you like at a bigger school.\n\nChicago is a great city to go to school in. Give up all hope of having a 'typical college experience.' What you get in Chicago is better. You were already going to go to school in Manhattan so it can't be too different. Columbia will give you a U-Pass, so use it. If you're not from here you'll have to work for rent, which is expensive, but definitely doable. Eventually you're not gonna want to live on campus anyway. I don't know how it compares to Barnard but I stayed at the other Columbia once, and it's not like that. Take it from me, the more control you have over your living situation the better your studies will be too. \n\nAnd I know it's New York that gets all the attention for Broadway but Chicago's theatre scene is pretty great, so you'd have that to go out to.",

I'm already working with a director now working on a play together.  All I could take when I was at CCC were a few play writing courses, no major available.  But yes, it's a great school for that.  And lots of fun.  Would do it again in a heartbeat.  Oh, did I mention the city is a blast (of cold air)?  Do it.",

The strong side of the writing programs at Columbia is that the biggest amount of emphasis is on actually *writing*. You'll talk about theory and character development and all of that, but it's a school that firmly believes in learning by doing. \n\nAs far as Chicago goes - I love this city. It isn't a cheap place to live, and Columbia isn't a cheap school to attend, but I absolutely love it here. It's a beautiful city, with hundreds of things to do and such a rich variety of cultures in the various neighborhoods.",

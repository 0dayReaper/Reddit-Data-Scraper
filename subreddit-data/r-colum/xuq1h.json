    "postText": "I'm a transfer student going into my sophomore year. I was at a community college for my first year and got 18 credit hours (over the mark of requirement to transfer) I applied two weeks ago for the Fall 2012 semester. Both my Columbia and Housing apps are in and they've confirmed they have my transcripts. I'm pretty confidant about my essay as well. It has been four times revised by one of my older sisters (a recent graduate of Michigan University with unbelievable academic prowess) and it has a great deal of subtext and ideas that perfectly reflect the values of Columbia (and of myself. I feel Columbia is the perfect school for me) Despite all of this, everyone I've talked to about having only just applied is giving me a lot of skepticism. I'm worried I might be denied or at least have trouble acquiring housing or setting up my classes with so little time before the fall semester starts. Even though its a rolling admission, should I be worried? What can I expect?\n\nDL;DR: I applied a couple weeks ago for the fall. I have all the requirements. Should I still be concerned?",

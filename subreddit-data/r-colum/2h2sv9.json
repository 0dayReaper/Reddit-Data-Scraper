    "postText": "Hello r/colum, we are a band called From Colors Beyond, a rock/prog/psychedelic rock band. We are based in Chicago. Our drummer left and we are currently searching for a committed, as well as skilled drummer that has their own equipment (drums on hand). \n\nIdeally between the ages of 19-30. Gender does not matter. Talent and ability required. Previous band experience not mandatory but preferred. Must be able to practice at least weekly, and be comfortable performing on stage. We would like to perform as often as possible. \n\nIf interested, please send us a message. Below are links to our bandcamp and soundcloud pages.\n\nhttp://fromcolorsbeyond.bandcamp.com/album/from-colors-beyond\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/fromcolorsbeyond\n\nThanks!\n",

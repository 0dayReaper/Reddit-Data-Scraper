    "postText": "The Center for Gender, Sex, and HIV Prevention at Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago is doing an online research assessing the experiences and attitudes of young Latino men who have sex with men and trans* Latinas when it comes to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a once a day pill that helps prevent HIV. The goal of this study is to understand and improve PrEP access in Latinx communities. \n\nYou will be compensated $30 in the form of a money order if you complete the survey, and you will have the opportunity to earn an additional $20 if you refer two eligible friends to the study.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n**WHAT IS VOCES LATINX?**\n\nVoces Latinx: The Chicago PrEP Opinions Survey is an online survey study that we think can help improve PrEP access for Latinx MSM and trans* Latinas here in Chicago. Participants are asked to share their thoughts about PrEP and also experiences with health care providers. The study is run by psychologist, Dr. Marco Hidalgo, and funded by Emory University\u2019s Center for AIDS Research (CFAR).\n\n**WHAT WILL STUDY PARTICIPANTS BE ASKED TO DO?**\n\nIt\u2019s a 25-30 minute online questionnaire surveying their attitudes about HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). They will also be asked about their experiences with healthcare providers. We\u2019re collecting this information because we think it can help improve PrEP access in Latinx communities here in Chicago.\n\n**IN WHAT LANGUAGES IS THE SURVEY AVAILABLE?**\n\nThe survey is available in both English and Spanish.\n\n**WILL RESPONDENTS BE PAID FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION?**\n\nYes, up to $50. Here\u2019s how: Participants will be compensated $30 cash if they complete the survey, and they will have the opportunity to earn an additional $20 if someone they referred also completes the survey.\n\n**HOW MANY RESPONDENTS ARE NEEDED FOR THIS STUDY AND BY WHEN?**\n\nWe're looking to enroll 100 participants by July 31, 2017!\n\nPlease go to www.voceslatinx.org to get started, or message us for more information.\n\nYou may also contact us at info@voceslatinx.org or call 773-796-3016.

    "postText": "Hey guys, i was admitted back in december but i havent accepted yet because of my financial situation. Im an out of state student with an EFC (estimated family contribution) of 0. Meaning i need to figure out how to afford 42k. I was accepted to undertake a film major and was wondering what scholarships/grants people have gotten off of their work (creative submissions).  Now im not assuming this, but im guessing ill be getting a larger financial aid package than most (less than 40k a year family income with 3 expected to be in college next year). I would rather be safe than sorry. \n\nAny info i can gather from previous students? \n\nThanks in advance, i seriously hope to attent ccc.\n",

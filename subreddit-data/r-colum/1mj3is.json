I am in Talent Management this semester and I need to find one band or two actors to manage for a project. I can facilitate bookings/auditions as well as help you with a portolio, headshots, etc. I am a former actor and I work in the theatre industry, so that is where my expertise lies.\n\nIf you've never had a manager before, now is the time. It's free, it'll help me out and I can help you out. It is a mutually beneficial deal. Send me a PM and we can meet on campus sometime.\n\nEDIT: I ended up joining a group with another girl who knew someone. So if you're reading this now, you missed the boat. Sorry. ",

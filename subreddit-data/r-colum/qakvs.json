    "postText": "Hi there...\n\nThese seems like a perfect subreddit to repost this at the moment.\n\nWe're a post-production house in Chicago focused mainly on commercial spot work. And we're looking for the perfect intern to work with our engineering/IT department.\n\nWe fix things when they break. We install and make everything work together perfectly. Our projects include planning and installing new equipment, computer hardware and software support, maintenance of video and audio gear, IT networking, and general troubleshooting alongside our editors and artists.\n\nIf you're interested, you should already have some background in video production and post-production. Knowledge about editing and graphics, and the software and hardware behind it would be nice. Knowledge about video and audio cables...how to make them, crimp, solder, troubleshoot, etc. Ethernet? Yes. Troubleshooting Mac, Windows? Yes. Linux? Oh, that'd be real nice.\n\nIf you're dreams are to become an editor, graphics artist, audio engineer, or some other awesome person who sits in the chair and runs the gear...that's great. But don't apply to this internship.\nIf instead...you think you've got a great mix of potential talent, interests, and desire to rebuild computers, wire networks, climb around ceilings digging in cable trays, and help support a video post-house...well...we should talk. \n\nWe're located in downtown Chicago. Send me a PM with a non-form-letter introduction, and I'll be in touch.\n",

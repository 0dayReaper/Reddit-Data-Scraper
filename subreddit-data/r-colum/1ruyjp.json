Or any current students studying in the ASL program have any wisdom to share?\n\n* What were your experiences? Could you leave with your degree and get a job straight from school? Did you get a job straight from school?\n\n* How are the faculty?\n\n* Are there many opportunities within the school to help you grow as an interpreter? (events to attend, etc. How did you have to go about connecting with these opportunities?)\n\n* What is the course load like? Could I have a part time job while studying full time? \n\n* What is it like being an interpreter in Chicago? How do benefits work? How does the school help to prepare you for interpreting in the workforce?\n\nMaybe you can tell I'm a little nervous. I just want this to be the right decision for me!

            "comment": "I'm currently in the program. It's a great program, and currently I don't see them discontinuing it for now. What happened last spring is that our department was moved from the education dept to the social sciences dept, and funding was cut. It's still there, but now there's a strict schedule you have to follow. Some classes are only offered in the fall, and the other classes are offered in the spring. You can't take a fall class in the spring, because it's not offered then. Make sense? One of the pluses for this is that now 2 sections are being offered for a class, but the problem arises when a student doesn't make the grade, or is stalled because of their Panel results. It's not \"oh I have to do this next semester\", it's \"shit I have to wait a whole year to retake this class\". I have dealt with being held back (because of a grade), and it's really frustrating, not to mention expensive.\n\nPanel is an assessment of your skills. There are 2 panels that students go through. The first is language based. Can you formulate complete sentences in ASL? How about in English? The second is interpreting skills based. I haven't done the second panel yet, but I will in April.\n\nFaculty are really great. The ASL teachers and tutors are all Deaf. The interpreting teachers are all interpreters active in their work and up to date on their certifications. I've found the interpreting teachers to be more accommodating due to my personal life being crazy (I have a child). They're all really cool people and you'll learn a lot from them.\n\nI've heard most students take the NIC and earn a 3.5 (out of 4.0) and are fairly prepared for the job. A few of the teachers were actually once students of the program and have successful careers. My Theory teacher said that her phone is constantly blowing up with work (she keeps it on the table during class, it doesn't stop blinking).\n\nDepending on the classes you're taking, you may find you have more, or less, time for work and leisure. Theory of Interpretation is intense, with papers due almost every week, a midterm, a final, and a research paper. Depending on the teacher you have will depend on how much time you have to devote to it. I withdrew from the class last fall because I was spending 15 hours/week on papers for Theory alone. With an infant and 3 other classes, I couldn't handle it. This semester I'm taking 2 classes, including Theory with a different instructor, and it's much easier. Either way, though, you have to dedicate the time to reading the assignments and writing the papers. I've heard that the interpreting classes I take next semester are fairly laid back with homework as well, so it shouldn't be a problem. There's definitely some time to have a part-time job, but being diligent about your homework is important.\n\nBeing an interpreter is different from most other careers. Most interpreters are freelance, therefore you must provide your own \"benefits package\", and no paid vacation or sick time, but you do make more money. If you do go into a job with benefits, your pay will be much lower, but you'll have the benefits package and a stable job (and you can freelance in your spare time). My one big complaint about the program is that, so far, I haven't really learned much about how to build my business, but I'm hoping in the 3 semesters (what I have left til graduation) to come I'll get all of this. \n\nAlso: if you're going into this field, your wardrobe will all be perfect for funerals. Always. Lots of black. Lots and lots of black. It's great because you don't have to coordinate clothing, but you also sort of lose that individuality that Columbia bleeds out its ears.",

Especially about class scheduling not being horizontally structured. I realized that the progression was linear in the sense of ASL 1, 2, 3, 4, but I had no idea you wouldnt be able to catch up in the way youre describing.\n\nWhat do you mean about not learning how to \"build your business?\" Do you mean getting in touch with agencies for interpreting? Or do you mean building a private practice?\n\nAlso, do you have any input on how the school helps you prepare for medical or legal interpretation? I'm thinking about going into medical interpretation (for the extra cash really...)\n\nHow intense is Language assessment? Do the interpreting classes help you form the proper english translations? I am most worried about my sentence structure in trying to re-explain a concept in english from ASL.\n\nThe all black clothing does make me a little sad. I have developed quite the polka dotted tie collection. But Just because you only have one color, doesn't mean you can't make it look good! (I suppose).",

                            "comment": "The language classes are offered every semester, at least 1-4, I'm not sure about advanced ASL. Many students will take ASL classes for other credits, and there are ASL minors as well, so those classes are plentiful. Advanced ASL is mostly only taken by the interpreting students, so I'm not sure the scheduling for that. You'll only be able to take one ASL class at a time, so you can't take ASL 2 and ASL 3 during the same semester. Sorry, I should have clarified that the interpreting classes are set by semester.\n\n&gt; What do you mean about not learning how to \"build your business?\" Do you mean getting in touch with agencies for interpreting? Or do you mean building a private practice?\n\nFreelance interpreters work with agencies, but they are not employed by them. Agencies are like a job board, people and businesses go to the agency about their needs, and the agency sends the job information out to the interpreters. You are your own business, so all your taxes and whatnot are your responsibility, not the agency's. \n\n&gt; Also, do you have any input on how the school helps you prepare for medical or legal interpretation?\n\nIt doesn't. There is a separate certification for those fields, and you'll have to check out RID's website to find out how to get that certification. \n\n&gt; How intense is Language assessment? Do the interpreting classes help you form the proper english translations?\n\nYou will have tons of practice with this. Consecutive interpreting is the first interpreting class terp majors take, and there's an emphasis on learning how to analyze yourself and word choice. It's an intense class, overwhelming and will make you rethink your major at least once, but it's totally worth it. You'll get a lot of skills based help. I think this is one of the strengths of the program.\n\nTo help you figure out where you're at, [*here's a link*](http://catalog.colum.edu/mime/media/5/1234/ba-asl-englishinterpretation-transfer-plan.pdf) to the course outline by semester. Now, since you already have a bachelors, you can cram some of these early semesters together, bonus if you have some of your ASL classes taken care of already and test high enough to skip some. For example. If you are assessed into ASL 3, you can take ASL 3, Deaf Culture, Intro to Interp., and Interp. Tech, so long as they're all offered in the same semester. Then, you could take ASL 4, Linguistics and Lang. &amp; Trans. Before you can enroll into Consecutive Interpretation (in their \"Semester 5\"), you'll have to take first Panel, which is the language assessment. Consecutive Interp. and Theory of Interp. are ONLY offered in the fall. \"Semester 6\" classes are ONLY offered in the spring. \"Semester 7\" classes ONLY in the fall, and \"Semester 8\" (Practicum 2) ONLY in the spring. You'll do 2nd Panel during the 6th semester, before Practicum classes.",

The profession is still small enough, and the need so high, that there are all kinds of jobs up for grabs. I think freelance takes more self motivation and ambition, but you can easily find work being in contact with more than one agency. My Theory teacher says that the pay is better, too. \n\nSince I already have a family, and my SO is planning to return to school once I graduate, I'm going to go for the set job and do some freelance on the side. My 5 year plan after graduating is getting my SO through school, only working if he *wants* to work. Once he's done with that, we're hoping he can find a salaried job with a decent benefits package and then I can do freelance full time. Our family can then be on his benefits, so I wouldn't need a company to provide them. Plus, then I could alter my work schedule to fit around my family time.\n\nAs far as getting more info about connecting with agencies, maybe call some local ones in your area and talk to them. When you attend Orientation here, you can ask then, too.",

The program includes more than just learning the language, but you'll really only be able to test out of the language courses.\n\nIf you can, I recommend starting in ASL III being that ASL I is mostly introductory and ASL II is what you'd learn after knowing ASL for a couple years without schooling.\n\nI'm afraid I can't tell you the book we use because I can't remember the name of it. Honestly, we rarely use the actual book, but we often use the CD that comes with it (which I also don't have the name of).\n\nIf you have any questions, I'm on reddit all the time.

    "postText": "So, I am curious what grads are doing now. My name is Luke, I graduated from Columbia College Chicago with a BA in Magazine Journalism in 2007. I worked for the school newspaper during my senior year (2007) then went out to New York, worked for a small newspaper out there, moved to Kansas to live near my best friend, worked for a small newspaper out there, recently moved back home (central IL) and now work for a small newspaper around here. I loved my time at Columbia.",

Going to move to LA to rejoin some past classmates in a month or so.\n\nI adore Columbia. My years there were the best ever. Spending all my time on film sets with my pals, cracking jokes, learning a ton. Undoubtedly I wouldn't be nearly as awesome as I am. ",

I'm also going to grad school in the fall (the Studio Art MFA program at SAIC). \n\nI loved my time at Columbia, but my life was such that I never really got to engage with the student community in a meaningful way. But it was definitely a life-changing experience.",

No regrets though, Columbia was a great time and I'm glad I went. I can still take bad ass photos, i just don't feel like weathering the stress of trying to make money off them. ",

My creativity doesnt really extend past the art world, and that was my hindrance. In the changing market, you'll need to be creative in selling yourself/your work to get by and stand out. I was able to do that somewhat but it was stressful to me doing so. It doesn't bother some people I know, who just keep on trucking and working but I prefer hourly work with steady paychecks every week ya know. ",

Reading what you guys are doing, and how you all enjoyed your time here really makes me happy c: I'm majoring in Film with a concentration in Documentary.. But honestly, that could change, which I'm okay with. ",

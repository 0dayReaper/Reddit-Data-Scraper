    "postText": "Hello Columbia redditors. I am looking into transferring BACK to Columbia for the fall semester. I was enrolled in the Television Production major last year, but dropped out and went with one of my original degree choices. Turns out that I still have very little interest in it. \n\nI was looking into going back to Television Production, as I was looking at the Majors and Programs page this one caught my eye. It must be pretty new, I don't recall seeing it last year. \n\nBut to cut to the chase, is anyone in this program? How do you like it? Does it seem like it would be worthwhile when looking into development jobs for mobile platforms? ",

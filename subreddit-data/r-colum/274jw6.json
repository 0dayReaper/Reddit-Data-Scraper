    "postText": "Hello! I've posted this elsewhere too, so I'll copy and paste. If you're an interested fan of MLP, or know one, please get in touch! :)\n\nThank you, and happy summer!\n\n_________\nHello!\nWe are three student filmmakers studying at Columbia College taking a production 2 class this summer. The director of this project spent an entire semester writing a paper about Brony culture, and would like to extend this into a 6-8 minute documentary/character study. We can meet over Skype to get acquainted before shooting begins, and we assure you that this project is intended to be uplifting and positive. This documentary may be entered into film festivals, and you can be credited with a pseudonym. Stylistically, the vision of this documentary is to be similar to \"Bronies: The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans of My Little Pony\", except shorter and focused on one Brony.\n\n\nWe do have a few specifications (if possible):\n\n-Please be 18+\n\n-Ideally located in/near Chicago (we live downtown and don't have cars :/) Even better if you're accessible by CTA!\n\n-We would love this doc to feature your MLP collections, posters, etc..\n\n-It would be great if your family/friends are willing to be interviewed. We found that the family interviews in Bronies: The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans of My Little Pony gave good context/insight to people that may not be familiar with Brony culture. (Anyone appearing on camera can decline to use their full/legal name in crediting.)\n\n-We would love to attend/film a Brony meetup. If you attend a big or small one, and attendants are willing to be filmed, this would be a big plus! (We don't have to credit attendants at all, or with a legal name, but they would have to sign a release.)\n\n-In terms of scheduling, things will move pretty quickly as this is a condensed summer class - we would like to conduct a preliminary interview (to be filmed - just you) Friday June 6th - Monday June 9th, depending on your availability. After that initial interview, shooting would take 2 weekends maximum, and would be Friday June 13 - Monday June 16, and/or Friday June 20 - Monday June 23.\n\n-Before the preliminary filmed interview, we would love to meet for coffee and chat, if possible. We understand and appreciate your openness to this project, and want to make sure our intentions and direction are clear. We talk about scheduling this over Skype. :) Interview questions and discussion topics will also be provided.\n\nThank you so much for reading all of this! If you're interested, you can respond here, PM me, or email us at mylittledocumentary@gmail.com\n\nBest wishes, and happy summer!\n",

Here's what you could say:\n\n\"Columbia college film students seek Chicago Bronies for short documentary! Looking to shoot a 6-8 minute positive and uplifting documentary over the next few weeks - if you're a big fan of My Little Pony, or know someone that is, please be in touch! We can be contacted at mylittledocumentary@gmail.com\"\n\nThank you again /u/Recr3tional!!",

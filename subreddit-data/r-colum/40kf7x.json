    "postText": "Hey! \n\nWe play indie pop and we need a new drummer (male age 21-27) who's ready to tour and put out records. Below is our soundcloud with some tracks. If you or someone you know is interested, send us an email with your name, musical background and some samples of your work. We've already got a lot planned for 2016, so this is definitely a big opportunity to jump on.\n\nThanks for your time!\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/2OGFGJol0pO9xyLEGACQn9",

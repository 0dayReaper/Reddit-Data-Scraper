I have a high school GPA of 2.6, ACT score of 22, and my recommendation letters were written by a teacher and my boss. I submitted three pages of nonfiction writing as a part of my portfolio. I applied as a potential nonfiction major. Should I be worried? ",

I'm from out of state, shitty town, shitty family, went to Chicago and loved it, all those happy feelings, and I'd like to leave my current situation as soon as possible. My job is an unpaid internship so I couldn't afford to move to Chicago to attend community college so I'd be living at home and going in my current city which I'd honestly like to avoid more than spending money. \n\nCollege things are foreign to me; are the core classes at Columbia not recommended because they're shit or because they're expensive? Or both? ",

I don't recommend them because the classes are about ten times more expensive than they are at a community college. Have you considered going to Roosevelt or another CC in Chicago and working part time for pay? There are a lot of options for living situations, so you could probably find something within your means.",

I felt like my highschool completely over prepared me for Columbia's gen ed classes. My advice would be to try to take ur gen eds during the summer at either Harold Washington college or Columbia. ",

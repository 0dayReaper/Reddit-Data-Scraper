    "postText": "I'm looking to transfer to Columbia for the spring 2018 semester, but I'm worried if I'll be able to go and keep my full time job. I work monday-thursday 2pm-1030pm and fridays 9am-630pm, so would it be possible to have a schedule that allows me to do both?\n\nAs for the photography program, how is it overall? Is it worth pursuing, and will it pay off? I'm not quite sure what I want to focus on in photography, maybe sports and fine arts.",

Theres some exceptions, but most are like that. The earliest classes start at 9 am, so in theory you could make a 12 credit hour schedule work if you took a once a week class monday thru thursday mornings.  \n Personally, id cut back a bit on the job hours, if possible, so you aren't completely run ragged, but thats just me",

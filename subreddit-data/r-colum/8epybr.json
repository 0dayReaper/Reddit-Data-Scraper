    "postText": "Hey guys. I'm about to get my Associates Degree in Graphic Design here in Kentucky, and Columbia is the college I've got my eye on for the fall. For awhile I've gone back and forth between getting my BFA in Graphic Design, but what is really calling me is taking the Comedy Writing &amp; Performance program. Is anyone else taking the program? If so, what do you think of it? Anyone else just maybe reading and knows anyone who's taken it, is it a good program to get into or should I stick with what I know? I figure and Associate's Degree in Design isn't the best way to find a design job, but I figure having that and a BA in this major may not be the worst idea in the world. Thanks!",

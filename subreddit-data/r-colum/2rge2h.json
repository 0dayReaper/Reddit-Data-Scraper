Ive been working a few extra shifts lately and havent had much reddit time BUT here are a few things I would like to offer you: \n\nThe cost. For what Columbia College costs, you can go to ANY other \"business school\" and get a better bargain. Hell, go to community college first and get as much as you can, then transfer. In Chicago alone, there are many more real colleges that offer business. \n\nColumbia College credits might not transfer once you do realize that you are in over your head. That would mean mega $$$$ down the drain. \n\nI work in medicine. Some of my coworkers that are in the business end literally tell me any application that has CC on it gets eye rolls, tossed in the shredder. \n\n\"general college information websites\" are often just fancy looking advertisements paid for my colleges. They can pay to have negative things taken down about them, etc. \n\nOverall, go to a more established, reputable school. A state school, a university, anything. You can be in big debt looking for any work to scrape by on. \n\nIn my building, there is a coffee shop ran by baristas that went to CC. They are all saddled with debt working in food service making low wages. You can have that same exact life. Hell, you can be a barista without the debt. Just walk into starbucks with or without a columbia college degree. ",

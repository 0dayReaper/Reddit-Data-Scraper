    "postText": "So I'm a 32 year old freshman.. First time in college, though I'm pretty well educated already. Having some trouble relating to peeps that are 10+ years younger... I mean, I'm getting along with people generally, but they seem to be a bit weirded out once I tell them how old I am, so I've stopped saying it.. Plus the first thing I automatically think when I'm talking to someone is \"hey let's go get a beer\" then catch myself, because shit, they're not 21! I'm also pretty surprised at how many students either straight up don't do their work or never come to class... What a waste of money!\nSorry this was more of a rant, my apologies.\nAnyway, are there any other older students out there? Any tips for us old people? LOL",

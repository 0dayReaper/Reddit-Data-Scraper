            "comment": "Using financial aid for an apartment has a pretty bad ring to it. Tuition at Columbia is expensive enough to where you won't be escaping without some sizable loans. Rent in Chicago isn't low and bundling that up with your financial aid and adding interest to your cost of living? Well, you'll be in a world of hurt once you graduate. \n\nBest advice? Find a roommate situation that you can afford. Easy enough on /r/chicagoroommates. Then find a part-time job that'll help you pay the rent. I'd advise something in serving because tips help offset the balance of time worked and money earned.\n\nThen, when you graduate Columbia you won't be staring down the barrel of a $80,000 debt-loaded gun. Hopefully.",

I mean, they have pizza available for weekend brunch, omelet bar is good, rotisserie chicken now, sandwich bar was actually better than Subway, etc. Just curious, what were some stuff you didn't like of the UC cafe besides the pricing?",

Pretty much exclusively wet pizza, dry hamburgers, and another Frankensteined third option usually made from yesterdays leftovers.   The sandwich bar was only installed for my last quarter, but their options weren't anything that I couldn't have made in my dorm. Primarily, it was the pricing which bothered me. Almost $3,500 for five meals per week? Give me a break.",

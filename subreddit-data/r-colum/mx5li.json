I'm not a film major, but I've seen great stuff produced by students here as well as not-so-great stuff in the film department and other departments. The program can only give you the resources you need to succeed. You have to supply your own creativity and direction.\n\nA lot of people wrinkle up their noses when they find out I decided to go to art school. I'm a fashion design major who flirted with being a biology major for a long time and I could have done it, but I picked what I was passionate about and I think of it this way, I'm learning a recession proof craft that can take me in any number of directions, that I actually enjoy. If you go into it with that kind of attitude and focus on producing work that will make you a great portfolio, you won't go wrong. Demand that you get the most out of your education. Don't just show up. Go to networking events. Go to the lectures by outside people they have on campus. Just this year, they've held lectures by a mathematician, a video game designer, a comic book developer, and numerous others I couldn't go to. \n\nI think a lot of people have this attitude that they don't want to be in school. They want to get it over with and be done. They're ready to be in the real world. I think of it this way: I'm never going to be truly ready to be in the real world, so I try to focus on gathering as much material, experience, and resources as possible. It's the attitude that you go in with that will make or break your experience here. A degree in the arts is not easily applied. It's you that has to make a way for yourself.\n\nI hope you enjoy your time here. My SO started out as a journalism major here and dropped out his sophomore year. I'm a junior and I love it here. :]\n\n",

Earning a degree after four years was never my goal; it was about my work and my craft, and what I could gain from those around me, the resources available, and the environment. It's certainly more true in the arts that a degree matters less and less if what you actually have to show for it is repulsive. You have a wonderful insight.\n\nHope to see you around. ",

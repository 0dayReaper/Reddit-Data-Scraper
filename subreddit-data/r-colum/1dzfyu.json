    "postText": "I'm pretty much talking about the marketing department.  I'm looking to transfer there some time.  I initially was looking to major in something like animation or graphic design...but I'm interested in their marketing major as well.  Anyone hear anything about it or currently in it?  Other non-art majors are welcome too.\n\nI don't need anyone telling me I should go to Depaul or UIC...I've already heard that so many times when telling people about possibly  doing marketing at Columbia.  I'm just interested on how the program is and have no notion of comparing it to other schools.\n\nThanks.",

Columbia is known for its art majors yeah but the student body of the school of media is more like what you'd expect from any other university.",

Columbia is an art school.. you need to go to another school for marketing",

That distinction is getting lost in the uproar.\n\nI really wish I'd gone to this; can't fault them for failing to promote it, only myself for not caring enough. I think the controversy over Carter's pay is like a conduit for frustration at the tuition increase in general. It lets activists illustrate the issue better.",

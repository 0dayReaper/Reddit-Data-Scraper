I do not play a marching or orchestral instrument and cannot read sheet music also. Is this school the type I'm looking for? I'm having a hard time telling if this school is more orientated to orchestra players or people with my goals, or both even. If you go here, how do you like the school? Thanks!",

You're teachers probably won't push you too hard though.\n\nI'm graduating this year and am very happy I came to Columbia but a large portion of my learning has been outside of the classroom.",

I know this is an old question, but you're still in high school probably, so whatever, I'll answer it. It's a good school for that sort of thing, but I second what everyone is saying. Just get your Gen-Ed's done somewhere else. It'll be like $500 at harold washington and it'll transfer as the course you took. The academics at columbia generally suck, but their specific majors like music production, fashion, film are all really good. It's incredibly easy, but truth be told, your columbia degree won't mean much around chicago past music production, so if you're not 100% sure on that being your major, keep that in mind. \n\nI went to Columbia for two years and transferred to Depaul because it wasn't rigorous at all. If you want good grades with no effort, Columbia's awesome. Here's the trick: Mid-terms and finals are all that matter. Everything else can be forgotten about if you participate in class.",

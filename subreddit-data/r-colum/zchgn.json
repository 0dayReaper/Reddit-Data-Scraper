I know I can't be the only one at Columbia that enjoys a few beers and a good game of DnD!\nIf we had to we could probably play in the basement of 600. Though we probably can't drink there.\n\n\nSo- Who's in?",

I've only done the 3.5 \"dungeon delves\" at my former game store, but had a blast and want to get into a more \"full\" experience. I'm a noob, but I tend to catch on pretty quickly, so shouldn't be too big of a detriment to the group. Is there a DM already? Because I definitely can't help in that regard.. :(",

I know some people in the suburbs wanted to play so I'm going to talk with them and see if they'd be willing to either commute to Columbia or if you guys wanted to take the blue line up there I could pick people up. PM me your Facebook and I'll add you to the group.",

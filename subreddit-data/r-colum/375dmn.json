    "postText": "Hello, I'll be an incoming freshman in the fall, staying at the honors college (does that even matter?) dorms in the student center thing.  Are there any bike lockers in the area? Or does the school care if I keep my bike in my dorm?  I work in a bike shop now and while I'm obviously not bringing my speedy fast road bike, I've invested a few hundred dollars into my commuter over the years and would really like to not just lock it up outside if there's any alternative.  Thanks!",

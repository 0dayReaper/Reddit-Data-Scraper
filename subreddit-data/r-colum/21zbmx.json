Obviously, it's tough to gauge what your student peers will be like, but take a look at the faculty listings and see if there are teachers here you want to connect with. That could be the thing that gets your dream career started, which I'd consider worth your time and money.\n\nHonestly, most of what I've done as an AEMM major could have been covered in two semesters, tops. But thanks to being at Columbia, I had a teacher who works at the exact place I want to work and set me up with an internship. That specific foot in the door is what I came here for, so I feel that I'm getting value from being a student here.",

They're great resources for real-world opportunities, and for real-world experience and expertise. Who would you want to learn from more, the guy who's spent 20 years working with major artists/brands or the guy who got his graduate degree 20 years ago and has been teaching since? \n\nThe city itself is a great place for things to happen, but it's also a double-edged sword. While it's huge and is full of opportunities for both established careers and independent work, that also means it's oversaturated in a lot of aspects, as well. \n\nWhat it all comes down to is whether you think the ratio of Tuition:Opportunity is going to be worth it with the effort you're willing to put in during your time spent at school.",

            "comment": "TheLAriver has it right - for me, personally, it was worth the debt. You can't put a price on the connections you'll end up making and hopefully landing that dream job where you want to be. dhporter articulated it perfectly, and I echo both posts above. I came here for radio, and while in a production class, my instructor was so impressed with my work that he referred me to the Chicago Architecture Foundation for an audio project for one of their exhibits - I've been freelancing for them whenever a project comes up since. \n\nDon't look at it as paying for classes, look at it as paying for the networking opportunities to bring you closer to your career goals.",

Transferred from community college into the Audio for Visual Media program. \n\nMy advice, is if you took any film classes previously try to contact the head of the Cinema Arts department and see if you can place out of some early classes.\n\nOther than that, super easy process. You'll have to jump through a few hoops to verify your transcripts and the like but it's no big deal. I spent a lot of time in the film department since I'm in audio post. Lots of great teachers and fun projects. Good luck! ",

(I found this out the hard way this week, now I'm stuck in a class that I don't need or want to be in.)\n",

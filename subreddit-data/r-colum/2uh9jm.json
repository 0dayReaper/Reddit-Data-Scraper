They assume most students live on campus and the commuters get shafted. (can you tell I'm bitter? oh well~) 10 AM classes getting cancelled is pretty rare, though professors can cancel their individual classes and if it gets bad out tonight Columbia is known to call of those late classes as well. \n\nIt literally just depends, but man. I wish they would get their heads on straight when it comes down to decisions like this. Most students are going to class anyways, and being that we only have 3 'sick' days allowed it's bull.",

I've seen teachers throw out \"Of 51% of students show up we have class\" and even my theory teacher is saying \"25% show up, we will have a review next week of this we cover today\" so if that scenario happens then we only need to come one day? \n\nso confused",

Professor's understand and if you ask them they'll give you a rundown of what's going to happen that day anyways. ",

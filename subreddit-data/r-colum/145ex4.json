    "postText": "I'm a professional international filmmaker looking to set up non-traditional internships.\n\nIts mostly corporate work (sorry, no car chases, explosions or nude scenes in my work), but its taken very seriously, often times gets international exposure (in various business to business market spaces), and is always working on projects for major international brands.\n\nI'm looking for men and women who demonstrate a passion, not only for the art of motion picture, but also a dedication to working hard and a drive to create great work.\n\nFrom PA's to AD's, camera assistants and operators to digital media assistants and editors, I am hoping to develop valuable relationships with good folks (with positive attitudes) coming out of my alma mater, Columbia College.\n\nInterested?\n\n",

    "postText": "Hey guys. Just wanted to ask whether or not i would still be eligible for this scholarship (deadline: January 15, aka yesterday) if i sent my creative samples and requirements (via slideroom..) on January 12th without sending the common app yet...\n\nI know i should have but my university counselor still has not uploaded my report card onto common app and i'm very irritated right now and anxious and wondering what will happen and if i'm no longer eligible. Thanks \n",

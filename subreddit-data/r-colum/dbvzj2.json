    "postText": "I am the program director for UIC's MA program in Applied Economics. Keep reading if you are exploring graduate programs here in Chicago for next year!\n\nThe program is designed for individuals who have not studied economics as an undergraduate or who do not have the math preparation to enter a PhD program in Economics but are interested in a career using economic concepts to analyze data. Through required coursework and electives you will have the opportunity to learn to conduct data analyses using software packages such as Stata, R, Python, and GIS.\n\nBy allowing the program to be completed within 10 months (July-May) we can minimize your time out of the labor force and get back to earning money sooner than a traditional 2 year MA.\n\nIn the first two years of the program, our graduates have found work at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, BMO Harris, Bank of America, and Nielsen Ratings just to name a few.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more, you can see our [website](https://econ.uic.edu/graduate/master-of-arts-in-applied-economics/) or message me if you have questions about required qualifications and potential career opportunities after completing the degree.\n\nPatrick Baude",

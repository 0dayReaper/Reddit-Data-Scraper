I haven't decided exactly what I want to major in yet, but I am a drummer and I love music, so I put down Contemporary Music. Do you recommend I go to community college for a semester/year first to knock out gen ed classes?",

Columbia is a great school with amazing teachers and staff, but it's very expensive and you don't need to pay 5x more for the same class you can take at community college.",

I've solely been taking courses pertaining to my major here at Columbia and getting rid of my gen-ed courses at community college over the summer. You can check online to see what credits are transferable. ",

It was awesome because for 2 years I took classes focusing on my major only, but networking was a bit tougher since most kids had already formed their networks and groups.\n\nI graduated with a great group of friends and a few internships under my belt, but finding a career has been tough so far, on that note I'm glad I only owe 2 years of school loans rather than 4!\n\nPerhaps commuting for a year or two from home is an option? A lot kids I know didn't like the commute, but it'd sure as hell save a lot of money.\n\nIf you're looking to knock out some boring/required classes for a far better price I'd go the CC or commuting route.\n\nGood luck!",

It's a little bit of an inconvenience but sure as hell cheaper than on campus housing. My dad also works in the city so I may be able to mooch rides off of him as well. That could definitely be a possibility.",

You're going to have a guiding hand in your artistic progression. That guidance isn't as effective in two years as it is four.",

Drive to midway, orange line to the loop.\n \nI didn't start college, again, until I was 23. If I could go back and do gen eds at community college I might have to save money but when I did that the first time I hated it and withdrew from all classes. \n\nYou meet a lot of people at Columbia your freshman/sophomore year but a lot of those people you might not stay connected with because different majors start branching off into their focus classes and you lose touch.   Or at least that was my experience. \n\nHalf of my sophomore and junior is really where I knew which friends were actual friends. \n\nDorming would have been cool but expensive, but there is a lot connections and friends to be made there too. \n\nPretty much what I'm saying is if you can afford it, do it, do it all. College is an experience and Columbia is what you make of it. I know a missed a lot by commuting but I'm still happy. \n\nPhoto major if that matters. ",

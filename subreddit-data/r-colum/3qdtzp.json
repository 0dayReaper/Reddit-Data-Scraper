    "postText": "I'm a prospective Cinema Art + Science, BA and I always hear from every film school how easy it is to get a job in the industry out of college or some kind of internship in college. So I'm asking film students straight up, what kind of internships and jobs are you getting in Chicago? Any big names? Or just smaller set stuff? I'm mainly a cinematographer but I'm also super into doing anything on set or in post including editing and Color Grading!",

You really need to push yourself to find them though, and when you do get the chance, be sure to prove yourself to the people you're interning/working for. Definitely try to focus your interest though, it's good to know a bit of everything, but it's better to be a badass at something specific. Feel free to PM me and we can chat further if you want some guidance.",

    "postText": "Hello, Columbia College! Please join Team Run for HD on January 30th as we host a movie screening at your very own Film Row Cinema theater. \n\n*The Lion's Mouth Opens* is a documentary that focuses on Marianna Palka (actress, writer, and director of *Good Dick*) as she bravely faces a life-defining moment as she finds out her results of genetic testing for Huntington's disease. It\u2019s a film about courage, fear, friendship, family, adapting, hope, and knowing something profound about your fate that cannot then be unknown. Two-time Academy Award nominated Lucy Walker (The Crash Reel, Wasteland) captures what unfolds in a way that is raw, honest, and without pretense. This film is especially relevant for those interested in medicine, biology, cinema, psychology, or sociology, as well as those affected by HD, documentary lovers, and the general public. Run-time is 28 minutes.\n\nDoors will open at 6pm for hors d'oeuvres, mingling, and a raffle. Screening begins at 7pm, followed by a discussion with a panel of experts from the HD and medical community. \n\nPlease reserve your general-admission tickets [here](http://eventbrite.com/e/the-lions-mouth-opens-documentary-screening-discussion-tickets-15214355547). Although this is a free event, there is a $12 suggested donation that benefits the Huntington's Disease Society of America (HDSA).\n\n[Facebook event](http://facebook.com/events/404170356413662/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular)\n\n",

I'm considering moving back with my family for the remaining weeks of the semester in the event I can't find a decent place or a roommate or two by then.  If I do move back with my family, I'm definitely will be looking to move into a place by August.\n\nOh, I'm a 25 year-old male photo major if that helps.",

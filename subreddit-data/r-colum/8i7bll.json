    "postText": "I\u2019m a junior in high school. A few weeks ago I visited Columbia and it was the first college I really clicked with. I really want to go there. I\u2019m looking at a major in illustration and minor in game art. I wanna do concept art or storyboarding. The problem is, I have a C average, and I live in a single income household. My mom\u2019s already sending my older brother to U of I, and my dad refuses to contribute if I choose to study art. My test scores are fairly good, which is really the only thing I have going for me. (1300 SAT, 31 ACT) I\u2019m concerned I may not be able to go, and just be stuck in community college learning business and other thing that will make me wanna die. \n",

            "comment": "You can get in. CCC has kind of created a niche for people who struggle within the more strictly-structured education system. Thus it's a sort of \"open acceptance\" policy that allows anyone to go, but once you're there you have to do the work or you'll get bounced out.\n\nThat said, it's not cheap. If I had advice to offer it's to take 2 years of classes at a JuCo, especially if you're going to be getting loans to pay for your education. I know at your age that's probably the absolute last thing you feel like doing, but you'll be amazed how much of a difference it makes to your future.",

Granted that was 7 years ago but the school's only shrunk and gotten worse at raising money; I imagine it's probably easier than ever before.\n\nThat said if you want to major in illustration, maybe don't go to college, especially if you'd have to go in debt to do it. Classes alone won't give you the education you need, especially for the games aspect. You'll still have to learn more on your own time. I didn't get a full-time games industry job until two years after graduating, and I was one of the better students coming out of the IAM department.",

Learn something that will pay your bills one day THEN go back to learn illustration at a much cheaper rate (or learn on your own, don't give bullshit schools like CC your money). ",

Having those skills more companies would find appealing. Illustration while cool is tough to get a job. I ended up going into construction and now work in corporate building websites for clients. \nCCC is a great school and you can learn a ton there. Price for tuition is way more then when I was there early 2000's. Get some loan assistance which helps. Ask questions be engaged and figure out what you want to do. Once you get out you have to make money. ",

    "postText": "Hi! This is my second semester at Columbia and I'm loving it, but I've kind of been having a hard time making friends. I'm a Cinema major with a minor in Journalism and I feel like majority of the people in all my film classes don't really talk to each other. I'm a commuter so I feel like that's kind of hindering me from actually making some friends who stay on campus. Anyway, if you're in the same boat, or just looking to meet new people leave a comment (: besides film, some things I enjoy are video games, tech, and music. ",

I'm a new transfer at Columbia and an Animation major, so I'm willing to make friends if this offer is still up! I'm a commuter as well, so I'm also down to talk about the new horror stories I've gotten just commuting to the city! I hope you're doing well so far!",

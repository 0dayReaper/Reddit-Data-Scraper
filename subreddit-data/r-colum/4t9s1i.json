I stayed in Plymouth, but visited both the Buckingham and the UC and have to say, /u/lkmeq is right, the Buck was so much nicer than the UC. UC does have a bit of a strict feel to it when the Buck has a condo feel.\n\n/u/DeePope is also very right, the food at the UC was raaaank.\n\nI only stayed in the dorms for a year tho, there's tons of alternatives out there and I ended up in a one-room studio for cheaper than most dorms.\n\nGood luck buddy!",

    "postText": "Hi Photogs, \n\nI'm looking for a wedding photographer for 10/24 from approx. 4-pm to Midnight. \n\nPosition pays handsomely, and I'm reaching out to students at Columbia because I'm excited to see a fresh perspective on our wedding night from an art point of view, and am excited about the talent at Columbia. \n\nAlso- I'm interested in having photos taken that evening, and receiving the full batch of photos for payment. I'm partial to a family member who edits photos but don't want them taking the photos at the ceremony/reception. If you really want to be involved in the editing or think it's a strong suit of yours I'm very open to the conversation. \n\nIf you, or anyone you know, has a knack for taking pretty sweet photos please help me get in touch with you/them- seeing a portfolio of photos would be great too. \n\nLet me know if there's a better place to post this- but I'm excited to speak with anyone who might have an interest. \n\nThanks,\n",

    "postText": "Hi everybody, I'm John, an incoming freshman majoring in Comedy Writing and Performance. I'm really looking forward to it but I have a few questions about what to expect:\n\n1) I've been doing stand up and theater for a year and a half already. How much experience do most of the comedy freshman have?\n\n2) How *IS* the major? Are the classes disapointing? Are the professors helpful? \n\n3) Do the professors work in comedy at all? Specifically standup?\n\n4) What's your favorite class so far (of the major, or in general?)\n\n5) I have my schedule with Fridays and Saturdays free, and no classes at night so that I can hit up clubs. I will be 18 upon arrival. Do you find that it's hard to get to clubs? or with my schedule should it be easy? (I'd imagine it'd be pretty damn easy).\n\n6) Do the clubs/open mics out there have deals for the college students? I'm gonna be very broke and won't have the money to pay for multiple door fees per night for open mics.\n\nThanks all, I look forward to getting to know you and making people laugh with you. ",

            "comment": "Hey John, I'm a junior in the major, great to have you coming. That's a lot of questions, here goes:\n1) it's hit or miss, I had quite a bit of experience and soon realized that what I was doing was very subpar. Not saying that'll be the same case with you, but tracking growth is huge. Some students have a ton of experience, some have none, the major puts everyone at the same playing field pretty well though. \n2) the first year focuses on the Theater aspect, so be ready to cut the jokes and get serious real quick. The sooner you take things seriously and drop the comedy act at first, the more you'll learn over all. Everyone has to take theater foundation classes, there is no comedy included for at least the first semester, so hopefully that doesn't turn you away. You'll grow as a performer I promise. It's totally worth it. You will learn to love Will Casey, I promise.\n3) All teachers that have improv or comedy classes work in the field. My two teachers for comedy theory/writing and performance have both directed shows at Second City. Stand up is great, but Chicago is the improv capital of the world. The focus is mainly on sketches/videos/improv and not so much on stand up.\n4) taking classes outside of Columbia isn't required but I've loved being a part of the iO training center. Depending on your funds, do some research on the city, find out what you're interested in, and do it. \n5) like I said, improv is the name of the game here. Brown line to Sedgwick will be a common practice for ya. The new iO just opened up, Annoyance finally opened. The train is gonna be your best friend. The more shows you go to the better. UP comedy club has an email service where if shows don't sell out they'll send emails out giving aqay free tickets. I got to see/meet quite a few cool comedians through that, Tom Papa, Chris D'Elia, Brent Morin, some other less known guys. \n6) there are some open mics for college kids. Columbia isn't the biggest on stand up, like I've said, so stand up is more kinda on your own. I'd recommend looking into improv and sketch comedy and learning that first. Stand up will come naturally once you get your comedy basics down. But that's just my own two cents.\n\nHopefully that clears a little bit up. Get excited, it's a lot of fun, the first year is gonna go quick, just hang on and try to learn as much as you can. See you in August.\n\nJonathan Klinger",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the detailed reply, Jonathan, much appreciated. \nI always figured that stand up was more of the typical starting point and then a lot of comics branched into sketch/theater, that's pretty interesting to find out it's done differently at Columbia.\n\nI was hoping stand up would play a bit of a bigger role, but honestly, I do have my schedule clear to do it on my own time, as I forsaw this possibility - glad I thought ahead! \n\nAnd I love dramatic theater too, so the theater foundation classes won't be a bore. I've always played comedic roles in plays and musicals, but I really appreciate actors who can do both and hope to try out drama more.\n\n:D I am excited. Thanks again for the reply. ",

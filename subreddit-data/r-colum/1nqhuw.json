    "postText": "Hey there, \n\nMy name is Charlie, and I\u2019m a recent film school graduate that\u2019s just moved back to the city after being at The Savannah College of Art and Design for four years.   I\u2019m really interested in building relationships with like minded collaborators to work on side projects and freelance film work that comes my way. \n\n In the past I\u2019ve freelanced in the city, and would love to build the relationships to take on work demanding larger crews.  So if you\u2019re a PA,  AC, AD, Editor, Sound Designer, Production Designer, Costume Designer, Motionographer, or whatever flavor filmmaker you like to go by \u2013 I\u2019d love to talk to you.  Check out my work to gauge my seriousness about all this, and drop me a line.  If I think we\u2019d be a good fit we\u2019ll chat and make some magic.  \n\nwww.charliecurran.com\n\nLooking forward to it, \n- C \n",

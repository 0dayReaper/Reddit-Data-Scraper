Know what classes really matter, and work hard at them, because the real strength of this school isn't the classes, it's that you've got 4 years to practice and refine whatever you do in a very constructive environment before you have to try to make money off of it.\n\nOn the flip side, be sure what you're doing is something you're going to keep wanting to do. If doing it is a chore, or a bore, or anything like that, you should reconsider. This place is too expensive to spend a couple years trying it out, and then decide \"Nah, actually I don't like it that much.\"\n\nOh, and take Lisa DiFranza for New Millenium Studies, or First Year Seminar, or whatever they're calling it these days. She's awesome.",

I was rather late to a few classes my first year due to not enough time and then getting on the wrong elevator....\n\nDon't exit the red line Harrison stop on the polk side at night. There's only one way out and, not to scare you, but that's a very common place to get mugged.\n\nCollege Math(the course) is a joke. You start off with basic 4+x=9 equations.\n\nMake sure you stay on top of all of your admissions/finacial/paperwork because no one else will.\n\nGet out and explore the city. Good rule is to go to two new places every week. Lincoln Hall is pretty bitchen. \n\nMake at least one friend in every class. Makes the boring classes more interesting and someone's always there to give you notes when your absent or even sign your name on the attendance sheet in the larger classes.\n\nTip for registering for classes- Figure out what you need to take, with who and what classes are open before registration opens. Write it all down, the second registration opens sign up for everything. I've never had any issues doing my classes this way- always get what I want.\n\nWelcome to Columbia. It's a hell of a time here.",

I mean it, they will ruin your life.  I think they only hire people whose only qualification is inhaling formaldehyde.  Make copies of everything you give them - they will lose it.  Do not trust anything they ever tell you - get them to either solve your issue right there and then, or put it in writing, or take video of them on your phone whenever they tell you something so you have proof, if you're calling them ask to record the call and do so.

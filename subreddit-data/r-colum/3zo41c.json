    "postText": "We play music along the lines of the 1975, Two Door Cinema Club and Vampire Weekend, and we're currently looking for a drummer to complete our line-up. We have released a few EPs, most recently one called \u201cOh Boy\u201d which you can check out on Spotify (link below) or YouTube (search \"look out love never know\").\n\nWe have big plans - an album release, rebranding, a new music video, amongst other things - in just a couple of months, but we need to finalize our line-up before we can proceed. Would you or someone you know be interested in this project? If so, please message me or comment on this post!\n\nThanks for your time!\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/2OGFGJol0pO9xyLEGACQn9",

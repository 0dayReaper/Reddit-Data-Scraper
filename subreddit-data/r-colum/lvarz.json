    "postText": "Hey, my name is Kirill Mazor and I am a Senior Columbia College student. At the start of this next year I have a gallery going into exhibition called Empathic Evolution. The space is on Michigan Ave just south of Harrison. Currently, I am looking for artists or individuals to get on board for a wide range of collaborations. This is open to all people, student/professor or not. The gallery itself is based upon the idea that collaborative artwork helps cultivate empathy, and that as a byproduct, this artwork actually has the ability to expand our capacity for empathy. The work within the gallery will be a wide range of all different types of collaborations; across many different mediums and as well as artists of different backgrounds. My overall goal is to put a gallery together that illustrates the overall theme of empathic involvement between artists.\n\nIf you or someone you know would be interested in learning more, please feel free to contact me. Thanks for your time.",

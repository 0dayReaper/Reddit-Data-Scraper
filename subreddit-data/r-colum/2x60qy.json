To be honest I couldn't stand the other students, no movie was ever good enough, every director major was just a douche, everyone thought they were above you. this was just my experience though. Looking back the only thing Columbia was good for was getting me a job. I learned literally everything on the job, not in the classroom. Columbia basically took a 80 grand finders fee. ",

People keep mentioning the egos of certain students, and it's true there's a lot of obnoxious kids here that think they're God's gift to the art world. But I've made a lot of great friends and connections here I don't think I would have gotten elsewhere. Teacher are hit-and-miss, which I think is the case at many schools, but Columbia usually has another staff member willing to teach you what you need to know if a professor is lacking.",

            "comment": "Comedy/Theater major here: Okay, some points I've noticed that could be good or bad depending on your personality and preferences.\n\n1. The classes here all start very slow. We have a wide-open admissions and there really are a lot of dummies. So there are no really serious academic classes. The academic classes they do have are very easy. Most classes seem to start very slow. In order to speed people up (as there're only a few honors classes, and other then that they don't sort class groupings by skill - for example: a person who's been doing photography for 10 years might be in Photo 101 with a first year photographer still). So sometimes it seems like the classes are very very basic and slow for the first half of the semester. \n\n2. There are some odd teaching methods, especially in te theater department. They're VERY different from high school theater, at least from my old high school. This could be good or bad for you. Obviously the more experience you get - the better - but I'm letting you know now, the classes WILL seem pointless for a while you'll probably want to resist.\n\n3. In general the intro/Gen-Ed classes are kind of bullshit. ake as many AP/College-level courses you can before coming here. The most beneficial way to spend your time is to do well in class, but then to find other studens and maybe some independent artsts/an internship to do YOUR thing at. The college itself is... kind of meh. If you must stay with just the college please audition/try-out for many activities here. If you JUST take acting classes but don't go do one of the shows here, it's going to seem pretty pointless.\n\n4. SFS will fuck you over. There will be a \"miscommunication\" that will not favor you. This has happened to everyone I know. They're monkeys on abacuses in there.\n\n5. If you have a meal plan at the UC: I'm not ENCOURAGING stealing, I'm just saying that if you DON'T steal, you're gonna ru out of money quickly and have a bad time. \n\nI'm leaving this school. I'm classified as a sophomore, but it's my first year. I want to be a standup comedian, and I still do, but I don't think this school is actually the best pick for me because of the rasons listed above. I want to be able to do my art at my own pace, so I think I will pursue an academic degree in something I'm interested in like philosophy or history, but if you do an art degree know this: You may have to pick between the art you really want to do and the art the school is commissioning you/requiring you to do. Being in that position is a soul killer because you really don't want art school to make you hate art, but if you thrive well under commission/taking-orders environment, then go for i. As a solo-comedian and writer... it's not really working for me. \n\nFirst Year Seminar, Writing and Rhetoric... these classes are so easy. You can get an A just for showing up, so if you don't want to be bored it really does come down to putting an unbalanced amount of effort into it that wopn't be rewarded except for intrinsically, which is kind of goofy since they're required classes that nobody wants to take. \n\nIF You are interested in playwriting: DO IT. THe one program I've had experience with here that is absolutely amazing is the playwriting program. Mickle Maher is a fuckingenius, take his classes. \n\nThere is a LOT of opportunity at this school, butit's expensive, and I'd highly advise gtting gen-eds out of the way first, and understanding exactly HOW you'll be using your creative abilities. Be a time-management master before applying to an art school, especially one this expensive where you may need to get a job.  (Which, by the way, don't get a job. The jobs near campus mostly suck, the jobs on campus are... well I guess thy're fine, utmy point is: You wantas much free time here as possible to fill up wit doing your art, otherwise the school-required art takes over). \n\n\n*EDIT: Formatting",

For years after I graduated, they attempted to get me to pay $12K in tuition I did not owe. It was insane, frustrating, stupid and ridiculous all in one.\n\nThankfully, that is pretty much the worst I can say about my experience at Columbia. Do not back down and assume the worst when dealing with those offices.\n\nThere's a lot of idiots that go to college. Columbia is no exception. It's up to you to decide if you're going to screw around because Columbia is an 'easy' school, or if you're going to take advantage of going to school in a major world metropolis with teachers who are professionals in their fields. You can bad-mouth the admissions policy, but discipline comes down to an individual.\n\nOn to the good. I started my college career at a state school. The \"regular\" general education courses at Columbia where much, much better than my time at NIU. They were taught by professional people, not dead-eyed TA's that I had at NIU. The class sizes were smaller for the most part. I spent nearly the same amount of time at Columbia than I did at NIU, and the education I received at Columbia is superior to what I was getting at NIU.",

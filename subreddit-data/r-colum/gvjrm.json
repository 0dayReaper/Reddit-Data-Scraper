In any and all categories. What the classes are like, what the area's like, the people. Anything you wanna share.",

            "comment": "I'm in the creative writing--poetry program, about to enter my senior year, and I've gotten a lot out of it.  The main thing I hear people say, and I agree with it completely is that you get out of it what you put into it.  There are a whole lot of people here just looking for an easy way to coast through college, and they come out with a degree in a super competitive field without much talent.  But if you apply yourself--get to know your teachers, get involved in the local scene for whatever it is you do--it can be a really good experience.\n\nThe other thing about it, though, is you sacrifice the majority of a \"typical\" college experience.  It advertises itself as an \"urban campus,\" which means there is no campus at all.  Just a few buildings downtown.  No real sports, no frats or sororities [those points are actually positives for me], just over all not much in what you think of as \"college life.\"  Very few people that I know even stayed in the dorms past their first year.   Going to Columbia means that you live in Chicago, learning how to do what you want to do with your life.  So if you know what that is, and it's more important to you than typical college life, go for it.  If you're not sure what you want to do, maybe consider somewhere else.  You don't need to cement yourself to this idea forever--I started as a photo student--but you need to have something you're driving towards.",

    "postText": "I'm just reaching out to any veterans for just an insight on the school, I get out this April and plan on applying for the fall term 2014. I'm hoping to enroll in the Arts and Design program and major in Advertising Art Direction with a minor in Photography.\n\n I have never taken the ACT's and didn't do too well in high school. I plan on taking the ACT's before this new year rolls around and apply to Columbia shortly after. Also, I am stationed in Korea so that, in its own, is very difficult with keep contact other than email. \n\nI guess my biggest question is, what can I do to transition easier? I will be eligible for full Post 9/11 benefits with honorable discharge. \n\nI also will be moving back to northeast Iowa after I get discharged. \n",

            "comment": "Woahcody: I work for Columbia. First, thank you for your service. Columbia has an Office of Veterans Affairs led by E.J. Talbot, also a veteran. E.J. is great and I'm sure would be happy to answer any questions you have, as well as assisting you in helping prepare for applying to Columbia. To get his contact information, visit this URL: http://www.colum.edu/Admissions/Veterans.php. It's true that we are on break right now, but E.J. may be still answering emails. \n\nAlso, let me correct something that was said above. Columbia is not an open enrollment institution. Our acceptance rate is far from 100 percent.  \n\nThe Department of Art + Design has some amazing faculty members, and I'm very familiar with our Photography faculty. You'll be involved in two amazing communities. Best of luck. ",

There isn't an attendant, and once you pass the ticket barrier there's only one way out. It's a trap. But it's safe during the day.",

            "comment": "It's easy to get the perception that Chicago's a dangerous place to live if you aren't familiar with it or living in a big city in general. But it's more complicated than that.\n\nSo first of all, you do not have to fear for your life. The South Loop is a reasonably wealthy area, in the heart of the city, with a lot of businesses and plenty of cops. A random college student getting violently killed right in the middle of downtown Chicago would be incredibly rare. (I hasten to suggest it never happens at all.) You're hardly likely to be victim of a crime worse than robbery if any at all....don't stay out too late alone, don't visit parts of the city you don't know much about without a friend who knows what they're doing, and you'll be pretty safe. Just exercise good judgment regarding yourself and your valuables.\n\nThere are some parts of the city that seem to have been abandoned by normal governance (and much of the population.) Particularly at either end of Green Line. You are unlikely ever to need a reason to go to these areas anyway.\n\nColumbia is well insulated from the areas afflicted by this terrible violence. From afar it's easy to believe Chicago as a whole is crime-ridden, but I can say in my own experience I've never been a victim of or witnessed a crime in many years of taking the Red Line in and out of the city.\n\n(I did have a girlfriend who lived off the Cicero El stop and that was always an adventure. I avoided anything bad, though.)",

Don't give a thief a reason to target you, and they won't. Spend some time exploring your neighborhood during the daytime. Figure out where you'll buy your groceries, places you're going to frequent, bus/train lines, and routes to these places and to school. If you have night classes, keep to well lit streets, and with crowds of people. \n\nDon't be afraid of Chicago. I've lived here for 4 years now and the worst I've encountered is drunks and crazies on the redline, and catcalls from the \"brothas\" when I lived near the Howard redline stop. Never been mugged, molested, raped or murdered, and don't know anyone who has, either. Keep an eye on your surroundings, don't flash your smartphone or laptop, and most people will leave you alone.",

And if you don't go south of about I-55 (the Stevenson) it's even less likely.\n\nSecond, don't look like a victim.  If you're confident and have your wits about you (not on your phone or wearing bigass headphones) bad people will tend to leave you alone.  \n\nNext, if you feel unsafe, do something about it.  It's infinitely better to be embarrassed because you yelled for a cop or out a few bucks worth of cab fare than to get robbed or stabbed or whatever.\n\nAside from that stick with friends, especially the ones who have lived in the city for a little bit and know their way around.  It'll help you get comfortable.\n\nThe other advice in this thread is pretty good.",

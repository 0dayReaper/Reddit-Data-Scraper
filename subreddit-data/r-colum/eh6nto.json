I was wondering if anyone here is in the film program or has any knowledge of it and if they think it\u2019s good or worth the money?",

            "comment": "Specifically what part of filmmaking are you interested in? If you do a BA rather than a BFA you\u2019ll get to pick most of your classes to fit your specific interests which has been an awesome thing for me. I\u2019m mostly focusing on editing but I also do stop-motion and I get to mix my interests together this way.\n\nLike others have said, it is largely what you make of it. That\u2019s what film school is supposed to be. The classes are a jumping off point to get you thinking for yourself both creatively and practically. Whatever classes you take it\u2019s going to be pretty easy to be a C student by just doing the work or you could be an A student by making something that\u2019s \u201cyours.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t believe the \u201cyour resume will be tossed out immediately if they see Columbia\u201d bullshit. It\u2019s just not that black and white. I know plenty of people who have found the jobs they were looking for after graduating. It\u2019s because they pushed themselves creatively and/or used skills outside of filmmaking to elevate their work. But I also know people who dropped out because they couldn\u2019t take any criticism, constructive or otherwise. It really is all about your attitude and how much responsibility you take for your school and career path.\n\nColumbia has its ups and downs like any other school. But for the most part I\u2019ve been surrounded by creative and supportive people both students and teachers. There\u2019s a good mix of backgrounds and attitudes and concentrations which I think is beneficial for learning to deal with people in general.\n\nSorry for the chunk of text. Feel free to ask me questions. I\u2019m open to talking about more specific things.",

Do you think that BA is more rewarding at Columbia or it depends on the person? Also from your experience and knowledge of the program is the 1st year like most traditional film schools where you don\u2019t really get your hands on the equipment and do a lot of film theory etc?",

If you just mean getting a job that\u2019s relevant to your degree, then it ultimately depends on the person and how much thought and effort they put in.\n\nThe first core classes you have to take as a film major(for BA and BFA) are Cinema Notebooks, and Image and Process. They basically get blended together so that you have a chance to talk about practical stuff and theory while also executing those ideas by splitting into groups and making your own short films - this includes a short doc where you interview a classmate, a short fiction with other classmates from writing the script to post production and a final project that\u2019s anything of your choosing. You are able to check out equipment from \u201cThe Cage\u201d but you have a limited selection. Basically the kinda shitty stuff because, rightfully, they don\u2019t trust first year students to take care of the equipment properly. \nYou also have to take World Cinema where you watch foreign films and write about them. They\u2019ve added another requirement since I started called Script Analysis for Cinema. I didn\u2019t take it, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like.\n\nThis breaks down the requirements for the major.\n[Filmmaking BA](http://catalog.colum.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=17&amp;poid=3224&amp;returnto=6301) \nIt\u2019s a little more structured than when I started. And in my opinion isn\u2019t as good as it could be. There are a ton of other courses offered that are not on these lists but seem likely to fit in with certain categories. But talking to teachers and advisors will ensure that you get the most out of the classes that you choose.\n\nIf you choose a [BFA](http://catalog.colum.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=17&amp;poid=3171&amp;returnto=6301)  in directing you have a little less to choose from in terms of classes but the required courses include directing and script writing. After that you can dabble in lighting, cinematography, editing, etc.\n\nI hope I answered your questions. I know it\u2019s a lot, but you pretty much have to take your education in your own hands and decide what you want from this degree and how to get there. In my opinion you might get more out of the BA rather than the BFA but I don\u2019t know what specific goals you have in mind for your career. It\u2019s all up to how much you\u2019re willing to do for your degree.",

Also a good idea to round out your education and take things that are interesting instead of shoehorning yourself (and I say this as someone who knew exactly what he wanted to do going in)\n\nAlso plus one to it is what you make of it. Chat with people, make friends, get on some shoots or post work depending on what you wanna do (and don't be afraid to chat with people and work in departments that aren't yours). Making friends and working on projects is what it's all about IMO, you may even end up hearing from people that heard from someone you worked with on something else, which in my experience so far is how a lot of film works to begin with. \n\nI dunno if it's different for non-post-production work, but I doubt anyone will see Columbia and toss your resume. So far in my experience, in my field (VFX), your reel is your proof that you can do the work, not so much your resume. And the rest is production hearing from other people that know you and can go \"yeah they're not an asshat to work with, they're a team player,\" that sort of thing.",

If you want to get into that kind of industry, or the arts in general, this is a good school with (from my experience) professors that can give good advice on getting a foot in the door if you seek it out. \n\nMost classes will give you the basic knowledge and skills, but to be successful right out of school you need to bust your ass to be competitive. I've seen people (like some in this thread) become bitter that they weren't able to get a job with the degree alone. But so much of making yourself employable will be having a good set of abilities that show well in a portfolio. So the key is going to inevitability be learning a lot on your own along the way and taking the initiative on challenges. Id be glad to talk about more if you have questions.",

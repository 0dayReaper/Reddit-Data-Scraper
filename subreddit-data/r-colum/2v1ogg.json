I am very peculiar when it comes to my sleeping habits so I was wondering if there are any dorms you can choose where you are alone in the room. I would love to have roommates, just not sleeping 2 feet from me.",

Check Craigslist and stop on by the sidebar of /r/Chicago. Trust me, you're much better off.",

I stayed in the dorms my freshman year, hated it, they're super strict and its a dry campus. If you comfortable with city living,  finding a studio a bit further north is the way to go. You'll discover almost everybody after their freshman year move out of the dorms and up north anyway. The only reason I would give you to live in the dorms freshman year is that it can be really tough to meet people at Columbia especially because there's not real campus and dorms definitely help. Other than that, there's literally no reason. \n\nBut yes, you can request the apartment style dorms, Dwight does that, that's where I stayed, and I requested having my own room. University center has them too, but they also have regular dorms.",

Then there's the private bedroom apartments, which are the most expensive, but you get a private bedroom typically with a nice view. The last one is a private suite, but those are really hard to get as there's only like 40 on campus",

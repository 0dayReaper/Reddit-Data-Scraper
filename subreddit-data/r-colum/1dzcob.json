Bob Bruno, one of the leading individuals in labor in Chicago, regularly attends P-fac's negotiations and is amazed by the amount of regressive proposals and straight disrespect the union is experiencing from the college. The teachers are trying to fight back against the corporatization of Columbia in the interests of the students, meanwhile the school continually refers to students as consumers and sources of income. \n\nIt's summer now, but the college and the teachers are still negotiating. Thanks to the student involvement and the recent protests and media attention the college is intent on getting this contract settled before the fall semester, but if the teachers don't get what they feel they deserve we could very well open next semester with a strike from 77% of our faculty.

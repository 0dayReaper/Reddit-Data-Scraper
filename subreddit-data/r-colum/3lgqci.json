    "postText": "Hello Columbia students there is a film screening for a film titled A Clearer Picture today and tomorrow located at 623 South Wabash in room 109 Hokin Hall. Again if you bring your student ID the price for the film will be $5 instead of the regular attendance charge of $10 \n\nThe Film screening time today will be at 5:30 PM\nFor tomorrow it will be at 3:00 PM \nI am hoping many of you will come and watch this film about a young woman who lost her passion in the arts and later rediscovers it after going through a few tribulations. There will also be a Q &amp; A for both of these days so if you have any questions you want to ask in person you can ask them there. \n\nEdit - Here is the link to the event on Facebook for those of you who have a FB account. https://www.facebook.com/events/904219546299381/",

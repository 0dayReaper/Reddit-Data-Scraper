    "postText": "Hey so I'm getting married July 14th out in Mt Prospect(so chicago residents would be better). I need someone I can trust behind a video camera for my wedding. I have a cheap Canon SD DV cam that can be used and I'd provide all the film and HW. If you have better Hardware and would like to use your own stuff. Please say so I can pay 200(negotiable) if just my HW is used. and we'd figure out better pricing if your HW is prefferable on both parties. This would be a 4-5 hour shoot.\nPost production will be my responsibility. \n\n\nPM or post below with any questions or offers.",

The thing about directing at this level is that very few people are going to come to you and ask you to direct their project; they typically are looking to direct it themselves, and as such it comes down to you to, essentially, do the same. Last year I switched over to screenwriting, though, and since then I've written quite a bit - I have a full season of a webseries, a bucketload of shorts, several TV pilots and specs, plus my first feature. \n\nEssentially, in screenwriting and directing particularly, you have to make your work in the industry, as opposed to finding work. The trick is to realize that any work you're doing is in \"the industry\", even if you aren't getting paid. ",

The program is good but everyone that I talk to who has been successful emphasizes that it is what you make it. Don't expect to just waltz through, get a degree, and land your dream job. You will have to work hard and build relationships, take advantage of every opportunity and build your portfolio and name while you have the chance. But there is tons of opportunity at Columbia that you definitely won't get at any CC. ",

At my college, there are many students who think that they'll just begin their career after college. Its so frustrating to be in classes with people like that. You aren't studying film and video, but do you see many people like that in your department? Or in other departments? ",

I haven't been to other film schools, but I'd be willing to pit Columbia up against most any other school. However, it's very possible for it to be very, very bad. As someone else said - it is what you make of it. If you work hard, get your portfolio built up, and build up connections while you're here, you'll have every chance of coming out of it with a job or the first steps at getting a job. However, it's entirely possible, and easy, to breeze through the film program here without learning anything majorly noteworthy while still getting your diploma. \n\nA big thing is what you're concentrating in. We're a fantastic cinematography school, and there's a lot of opportunities here for screenwriters. I started out concentrating in directing, however, and I'd recommend that you very carefully consider that if that's the way you're going. It's not that our directing program is bad, per se, it's just too small for the amount of people in it, and unless you're very lucky you'll be hard-pressed to get through it in 4 years - or at least, that's how it worked for me. This isn't really a bad thing; there aren't a lot of jobs for directors, and it's incredibly beneficial for someone who wants to direct to learn other aspects.\n\nOverall, yes, it's a good program. I've learned a lot here, and I've made some really good connections with people in the industry or who used to be. But you have to work hard in order to come out of it in any kind of position to work on a film set. ",

Any other dance majors on here who would like to give me advice? how's the department? what style is the main focus? If anyone else who would like to give me some good information, it would be greatly appreciated!",

They were all very nice and we generally got along. I didn't like that you could only check in 2 guests at a time either. Thats a bit annoying but I understand because safety shit. Most of my classes are in 618 &amp; 624 s. Michigan the elevators in 624 suck so get to class early if you have class there. ",

I can only speak for the area the on-campus housing is in.\n\nMy girlfriend lives close to the plymouth ct. residence hall. That area is quite nice. Plenty of public transit close by. It is safe for the most part aside from strange isolated incidents [like this one](http://www.myfoxchicago.com/story/20579236/conductor-found-dismembered-body-near-lasalle-blue-line-tracks). But they don't occur often.\n\nThe restaurants around the area are good, there are 3/4 grocery stores close by (within walking distance) and a target within walking distance as well.\n\nThe on campus housing buildings themselves seem like nice buildings, although I've never been inside. The lobbies are nice and seem to have doormen at each entrance, at least for the state street residence. ",

What else... talk to people in your classes that's a major thing because networking at Columbia will help you out a lot in the long run. Do you need to take the basic classes here too or are you transferring a lot of credits?",

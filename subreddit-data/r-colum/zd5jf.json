    "postText": "SO! Got any ideas of what we should do? I've never organized a reddit meetup, or even been to one.  Voice your opinions and it shall not suck!\n\nEdit: My only idea right now is to meet up at a Colum. building, go get some chinese food from China Town, and if it's a small enough number chill in someones dorm/apartment. maybe throw a mini party. I'd volunteer my house but...I live in the northwest suburbs. However, once I move I will have no problem holding future events at my apartment.",

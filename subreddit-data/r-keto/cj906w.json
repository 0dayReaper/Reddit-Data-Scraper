But now after being keto since May 2018, I dropped 125 pounds and conquered a mountain. \n\nDon\u2019t let anyone tell you Keto doesn\u2019t work. It does. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you your metabolism is bad and you can\u2019t lose weight anymore. You can. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you you can eat all the bacon. You can\u2019t. CICO still matters. \n\n125 pounds!\n\nI\u2019m now a size 8 and too skinny. Figuring this maintenance thing out. Want to get back up to 145 lbs.\n\nNever give up on you. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/3f6lrkd",

Have a Ketomojo blood ketone tester to verify.\n\nSuggest you also get one, to find out how much fruit you can tolerate without kicking yourself out of ketosis. You may find you are pleasantly surprised.\n\nAnd you are not too old for ketogenic diet!!!!\nI am much older than you, and achieve the state of ketosis just fine - *and* with fruit!",

It\u2019s not like I\u2019d never dieted before, because I literally tried everything (even hypnoses). But nothing worked, or lasted, because it wasn\u2019t real, they were diets and fads. KETO is not a diet and don\u2019t start it if you plan to stop some day. It is truly a way of eating that allows everything to come together for your body to begin burning fuel and repairing your body. \n\nAnd don\u2019t kid yourself your sugar addiction is real. In order to get rid of it, just like with any addiction you have to go cold turkey. No sugar. No sugar substitutes. No prepackaged foods. One month of purifying your body of sugar will make it easier to do another month and then another and so on. Only when you think you have it under control, then add a diet soda or artificial sweetener to your coffee or whatever. But beware too much could trigger you, so only add it occasionally and take it from there.\n\nBest of luck. And thank you for posting",

                    "comment": "When I was doing KETO (before maintenance which I\u2019m doing now). I was very strict. In the first month I didn\u2019t count net carbs, I. Counted the carbs and ignored any fiber subtracting. I also gave up all sugar, no substitutes, therefore the only thing I drank was water. After the first month, when I saw how good it was going, but I wanted more carbs, I started going with net carbs. I also learned that three meals sucked, because I didn\u2019t have to hit my macros for carbs and fat, as long as I always hit my protein even if it meant drinking the protein drinks which while the chocolate is awful, it\u2019s not a milkshake. But I knew I had to hit my protein. So if I wanted a good steak (ribeye is my favorite), I\u2019d have to plan supper first and work backwards. If I was having a salad with Ranch with my steak and if I was frying up onions and mushrooms to go with the steak, I would go to MyFitnessPal and put all that in,  whatever was left, is anything that what I could have for either breakfast or lunch. If nothing was left, then it would be fasting until supper. \n\nI used MyFitnessPal every day, still do, and I check Reddit every day. I lean on all the good people who post because they really helped me. \n\nAbout 6 months in, I started adding in diet sodas. Water is great BUT!  Then I found out if I added rum to the diet drink it didn\u2019t taste too bad, so if I had 65 calories or more to throw away, I\u2019d have one. Never stopped me from losing so why not, and with KETO it\u2019s really like having three, at least it is to me, so one is great  \n\nSo yeah, by the end it was pretty close to one meal a day plus my evening drink and maybe a snack of Parmesan cheese crisps if I have any fat left. Almost no carbs and I don\u2019t care if I go over on my protein. \n\nNot sure if this will help you, but that\u2019s what I did.",

I'm not getting any younger. I used to do a lot of hill walking and miss it so much. At 150kgs, hillwalking is a distant memory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTried the Keto diet 3 times and each time I got to a stage a couple of weeks in that really scared me. I felt like I was dying. Not trying to be over dramatic but it was horrible. Like i've never felt before. Reading posts like this rekindles my interest in Keto.",

The only way to lose weight (if that is your goal) is to take in fewer calories than you expend.  Eating fat is a way to keep you feeling satisfied/satiated.  Even on Keto, if your caloric intake is too high, you will gain weight.  \n\nI'm fairly new to it myself, but I generally try to go over my protein goal, limit carbs to less than 20g and eat far less fat than the calculator tells me.  No fat bombs, or wrapping everything in bacon (as much as that sounds delicious).  Best of luck!",

He didn\u2019t give up cigarettes when I quit and he didn\u2019t give up his nad eating habits either. Luckily my daughter and her husband were doing KETO and having Grey success with it and I asked for info on it. They directed me to download two apps: MyFitnessPal and Reddit. Best thing I ever did and I still do it every day.  \n\nBut it is difficult living in the same house with people who aren\u2019t doing KETO but it is possible, I\u2019m proof. Just make yourself a priority to you. So many times we do things for others instead of ourselves. This is something you have to do by yourself. I still had to cook meals he liked while doing mine, but as he saw the results, even though he didn\u2019t want to eat my way, he did start supporting me. He\u2019d even make my salad and weighed each item (my salads were easy: 100 grams lettuce, 50 grams each of tomato and cucumber). He never complained when he\u2019d have his favorites and I\u2019d have a ribeye or KC Strip.  \n\nTwo weeks in is a difficult time, keep going. I promise you by the end of the 4th week it\u2019s become a real habit and it does get easier. Do it for yourself.",

But there were people policing them if they saw anyone doing it, and the trails has occasional pieces of trash, but not bad, because people were watching. A tissue I had in my pocket fell out and before I could bend over to get it the person behind me did and handed it back to me.  There was very little on the way down\u2014probably because it\u2019s so difficult no one thinks to try and eat then.",

I actually caved this morning \ud83d\ude1e\nIs there something else out there that I don\u2019t know about that\u2019s similar and would satisfy my craving? I\u2019m really struggling lately and feeling bored of all the restrictions \ud83d\ude14",

I shall certainly be trying this.\n\nIs it very sweet?\n\nI'm often alarmed by the quantity of sweeteners in recipes and find it rather off-putting.  I'd very much like to minimise the amount of sweetener, do you think that's reasonable or would it taste like the bottom of a bin?",

Put 10g ground flax and 20g mixed nuts in a blender, I find Brazil nuts and pecans give the best taste. Put in a pan with 20g hemp hearts and a small amount of milk alternative and heat gently. Add some salt and maybe cinnamon m. The flax causes it to gel like oats do when it is hot, it doesn\u2019t take much cooking. Add topping of choice.",

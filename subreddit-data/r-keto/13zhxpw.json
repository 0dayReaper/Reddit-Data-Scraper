    "postText": "Goin through something here.  Divorce, custody, finances, unemployment.  Crawling out of all of those things.  Straightening my life out creating good habits and lifestyle.  Diet is a central element.  I've been on keto for 3 months, and I've dropped 30 pounds. Have a tendency to relapse every few weeks when something comes up.  Frankly eating a bag of candy is better than alcohol or other behaviors, so that's what Ive done.  But not this time.\n\n\nReally the cravings started yesterday when I took up a social offer to go to dinner.  Ended up having a taco salad.  I did have some chips and salsa, and I know that the carbs in the meal triggered some strong cravings later last night and this morning.  Went to the grocery store, and it was really hard, but I was able to find a little something new that helped me get over the cravings.  I think part of it certainly had to do with just getting something different, even keto friendly.\n\n\nReally glad now that I held strong.  One relapse day for me can put me back 4 days of progress.   Not magnificent story, but a big victory for me.",

But I also agree with you: sounds like you are going through a lot and although perfection in all areas sounds nice, it isn\u2019t always possible. carbs are less dangerous than an alcohol bender.  Be gentle with yourself and just start again.",

Many things taste horrible after brushing, so it is more of a deterrent than anything. Typically the feeling passes before the post brushing effects have vanished.\n\nOne of the veggie trays my refrigerator occupied by keto snacks now.  Some combination of hard boiled (or deviled with avocado) eggs, yogurt, pepperoni, pre-cooked hamburger, assorted cheese, fat bombs, olives (because I like them cold), dil pickles, etc.  Even though I know I don't HAVE to eat, since I am just craving something, I would rather eat something out of the drawer (or the cupboard) than give in a cheat.\n\nGood luck to you!",

Just like something that certainly is food, certainly is keto, but isn't all that rewarding in and of itself. That way if I'm actually hungry, I'll eat some, but it works to help gauge whether I'm actually hungry or just craving.",

And you aren't alone - I also find there are surprisingly strong sugar cravings even after a couple of months and 20 lost lbs.  \n\nUpdated to say - understanding in the moment the emotional distress is the culprit is half the battle.  \n\nIt's best /easiest / fewest cravings for me to do when I\n\n* IF 23.5/.5 (OMAD), \n* stick with mainly whole foods, \n* keep up with electrolytes,  \n* and stay under 1k calories \n\nI say that like it's a thing, but honestly, I am HARD PRESSED to get more than 700 Calories per day in, and my one meal a day is SO good. \n\nYesterday's included steak, smoked salmon, cherry tomato salad, broccoli, and yogurt with strawberries, blackberries, and a little keto cinnamon muffin  &lt;= a mug cake I made with nut and coconut flours, not a \"whole food\" but at least homemade.",

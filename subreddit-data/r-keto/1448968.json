I walk my dog every day for 30-45 minutes and during summer months do random manual labor type yard work. I have back problems which always seems to get very bad with sit-ups and running, thus am reluctant to have an exercise regime.",

I'm kind of flat lining on WEIGHT, but my body fat % continues to slowly drop and my pants continue to get looser and looser.  Started as a 36 loose, 34 TIGHT, and now am 34 loose, 32 tight sizes.\n\nSo, it helps weight loss no matter what, I often found MyFitnessPal yelling at me that I didn't eat enough and giving me the anorexia hotline number 4/7 days a week.  I just wasn't hungry, so I didn't eat.  I wasn't TRYING to only eat 1000 calories, it just came out that way.  The extra fat was satiating for longer.  Even forcing myself to do a snack after dinner, like a Keto Ice Cream Bar (Kirkland) usually only got me to 1,200 cal.\n\nSo yeah, Keto for weight loss.  Exercise for health and strength of body.\n\nNote: I went to Chicago for a concert this week, ate Donuts (Stan's) for breakfast, Tacos (Flacco's) for lunch and full burger and fries (Kuma's Corner) for dinner.  Had a slice of deep dish (Gino's) for lunch before driving home last night.  Today, my weight is only .25 lbs more than  Monday before I left for the concert.

The biggest stimulus for our brains is movement, and thus the age old proverb of \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d applies here - keep active and keep your brain!\nSo no, you don\u2019t need to be worrying about exercise for weight/fat loss - however it is still important for holistic good health. Maybe consult a chiropractor if you can? If you\u2019re overweight, you may find some of the symptoms subside as you progress with the fat loss too. \nIn summary though:\n\n1. Yes keto will absolutely get you burning fat whether you are exercising or not.\n2. Walking for 30mins a day is good stimulus for the brain actually, so if you\u2019re not worried about building muscle or getting super fit, this is probably sufficient.\n3. If it\u2019s your first time going keto, do a little research on electrolytes and avoiding keto flu. I never experienced this myself, but I know some have and it\u2019s put them off keto. It can be avoided though!\n4. Try it for a month and let us know how you\u2019re getting on! Keto has completely changed my life for the better - I hope you have the same experience :)",

I lost even more on carnivore (zero carbs) and on carnivore I could not eat enough steak, eggs, meat, fish, butter to stop loosing weight, so I reintroduced carbs. I recommend that for the first 6 months your exercise stays in a fat burning zone (zone 2 you can talk without gasping for a breath). So walking would be perfect. I would advise against strenuous exercise until your metabolism is well adjusted to flexing between ketones and glucose. As an example, one morning before a bicycle race, my fasting glucose was 78. I rode a 70 minute race at high intensity in a fasted state. My glucose at the end of the race was in the 130\u2019s even though I ate nothing. My body released stored glycogen. When you are new to keto, if you burn your glycogen and raise your glucose, your going to have more cravings. After your are metabolically reset, you won\u2019t.",

But, when you exercise (lift weights) your body won\u2019t sacrifice muscle for energy nearly as much because it is preserving that source of energy knowing it\u2019s needed. \n\nWhen you lose weight without being generally healthy with your maintenance like others have commented on, you\u2019ll end up looking unhealthy and skinny.",

If you do intermittent fasting as well, you may lose some weight without exercising, but in any case, you can expect some muscle loss when doing any diet without exercising.",

            "comment": "A common misconception. Humans evolved to be persistence predators. There aren't many animals that we eat that can't take us in a sprint. Our bodies are designed to chase a gazelle for 10s of miles across the savannah and being able to do so very efficiently was our ancestors survival advantage. So, we're very good at not burning calories to do activities. \n\nNow, I'm not disparaging exercise here. It plays a vital role in keeping us healthy. However, for the vast majority of us, 70-80 percent (or more) of the calories we burn in a day are burned for maintenance and to fuel our basic metabolic processes. So, in essence you'll never be fit through exercise alone and if you get your intake under control, you'll have won 80% or more of the battle. \n\nIn my case I haven't really changed my activity level much and I've dropped 32 pounds in 6 weeks from 368 to 336 through diet and some fasting alone. Don't get me wrong, I'll start increasing my activity level sooner than later, but it's a lot less stressful on my joints (also have PsA) to ramp up the exercise when I'm not throwing as much weight around.\n\nHope this helps! Good luck!",

I'm eating pre-cooked keto meals and keto protein bars as snacks but probably don't get into caloric deficit. \n\nThen I did high intensity cardio for 1.5 hours one day and immediately saw 2lb weight loss and ketosis. No cardio the day after and my weight is exactly the same again. So I guess for me cardio is mandatory for weight loss.",

    "postText": "I wanted to make this post for anyone that's looking to start, has started but has fallen off or stalled or for anyone that's in the tail end of their journey to show that if you put your mind to it, you can achieve anything. I'm just an ordinary guy and I was able to hit my goals. Not always with ease but I was able to get through them.\n\nThis is a day that until recently I thought I wouldn't never see. I'm officially under 200 lbs.\n\nI started at 545 lbs in January 2016 and today, in June 2019, I'm 199.8. If you would have told me 3 and a half years ago that I would be here, I would have laughed in your face but here I am. I went from a 7XL to wearing this nifty Medium Tall jacket. \n\nIt wasn't always the easiest of things to do but instead of letting any setbacks or obstacles slow down or ruin my progress, I chose to use those as motivation to get through those times. \n\nI think I can honestly say that I've gained a life. I went from having trouble fitting into an airline seats,to as of recently being able to jump out of one to skydive. Im grateful for all the support along the way and for those that have supported be since the beginning.\n\nAfter going through all this, I'm a firm believer that there isn't anything that can't be achieved by myself or anyone else as long as you put in some time, dedication and have a little determination (or stubbornness). Whether it's losing weight, finishing school, jumping out of a plane, getting that promotion, finding your dream job, asking that cute girl out, wrestling a bear, or climbing Everest. If you want something, go after it! \"God placed the best things in life on the other side of fear\" \n\nAt 6'3 and 199 lbs, I think I'm finally at my stopping point. Now the challenge of maintaining. But for the mean time, to quote Jon Snow, \"My watch has ended\". #keto #weightloss #lowcarb #atkins #bacon\n\nUnder 200 lbs! https://imgur.com/gallery/jXfAOAM",

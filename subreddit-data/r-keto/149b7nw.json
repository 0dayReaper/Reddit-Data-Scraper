    "postText": "Tomorrow will officially be 9 weeks that I\u2019ve been on keto and I\u2019ve noticed a trend with my body.   \n\nLast month, I gained two pounds before my period and by the following week, I was down 3. This time, I lost weight like normal before my period but now I\u2019m up two pounds after ending my period before yesterday. I know body fluctuations are normal but I just wanna make sure that it\u2019s nothing I should be worried over. I track every single thing that goes inside my mouth and have been staying under my calories and the only macro I often hit is protein. \n\nI guess I just need reassurance.\n\nI was very excited for finally be 188 (I haven\u2019t been that weight in years) but now I\u2019m back to 190 :/",

You\u2019re a human and it\u2019s normal to have weight fluctuations, that doesn\u2019t mean you actually gained body fat. You didn\u2019t. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nIf it\u2019s stressing you out, I recommend staying away from the scale for awhile. Weigh yourself once a month or so instead.",

            "comment": "Our weight normally fluctuates as much as 6 lbs on a given day, so what you report is meaningless, and why daily weighing can be deceiving.  You want to look at weekly or, even better, monthly results to get a better picture of your progress.",

            "comment": "It's very important not to micromanage the scale.  It can be every bit as demotivating as it can be motivating.  I say this as a person who tracks everything I can on this diet.\n\nSome weeks you eat super clean, exercise like a maniac and the scale doesn't budge.  This expectation of a reward can be very deflating when it doesn't happen.\n\nSimilarly you can have a week on the sofa, eating non whole foods and dreading the scale...and your a kilo lighter.\n\nI've found great benefit in measuring a number of factors.  Various body dimesions, blood pressure, blood glucose, exercise progress.  I may not have lost weight this week, but the pants fit better and I can now swim a mile without pause.\n\nYou will see references to plateaus (a very overused term here by the way) and whooshes.  For a lot of people, me included, the weight loss is linear, then it pauses and the body fat seems to move around.  This can be seen in the \"no weight lost, but I'm putting holes I my belt\".  Then one day you wake up and whoosh your significantly lighter.  It's weird to experience, but it is quite normal.\n\nTake the longer view and keep an eye on progress outside of just weight loss.",

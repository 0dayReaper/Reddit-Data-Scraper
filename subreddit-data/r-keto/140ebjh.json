    "postText": "Hi all\n\nBeen at Keto now for about 5 months. Quick history. I did AIP diet before this to help with mental health issues and weight loss issues. They both went down on the diet, so I thought maybe Keto is the next step.\n\nKeto was an adjustment even though my carbs were already fairly low at about 50-70 per day. It was a real mixed bag. I had some real hard times sleeping when adapting. Learning  new recipes was tricky. I also found for some reason over the beginning I was not getting the energy I had heard about. However my mental health anxiety symptoms were remaining low. Over about 3 months of keto my weight stayed still. So it felt like a holding pattern. I was considering quitting, but I also had read sometimes these improvements can take 6 months - year.\n\nA nice boost was my bloodwork, which looked much better than my last test. Especially testosterone, which was low normal before and now is high normal! Best result in 3 years. Even my cholesterol levels were fine.  That was encouraging. So I began to tinker a bit more.\n\nBiggest thing I tried, and this is a god given gift, was to reintroduce coffee. When my anxiety began 4 years ago, Coffee was a no-no. I could not handle it, my symptoms would go too high. I haven't really drank coffee in years. So i tried a keto coffee with coconut oil (Bulletproof style). The last two weeks my energy has gone way up in a good way. I'm drinking coffee every morning, just a cup or 2.  My mood has improved, libido is better, and less hunger! I went almost 18 hours without even thinking of food. And now my weight loss has continued again, about 3 pounds lost this last month. My fat mass is decreasing and muscle mass is going up. I think 6 more months of this will create a real solid improvement.\n\nI can't say how happy I am about this small thing, I love coffee. I have missed it so much, now I'm drinking it again. And my weight is dropping. I haven't been this light in 5 years. I feel I've got over a big plateau. I think Keto may have helped me enough to handle it again. \n\nMy biggest mental health improvement in the last 5 months is less nightmares. I used to have them every night about a year ago. Now they seem to have stopped.(?) Now if only I could get rid of the mild brain fog I have.\n\nI am an N=1. But for me, I've tried alot of stuff these past 4 years to improve my health. Is keto helping? I'm pretty close to giving it an official stamp of approval for me. I'm going to do another set of blood tests end of the month. But right now I'm encouraged again! Another small improvement have come from adding shirataki noodles (low cal easy snack).  Probably at least 3-6 months more before I consider changing anything.\n\nYou know, there's always some hope out there somewhere, I've come real far from a real dark place. Diet has helped me when a lot of things did not. Glad to be here right now.",

You did so well getting through that plateau, I might have cracked at that - keep doing what you're doing it's working wonders by the sound of it \ud83d\ude0a and what wonderful mental health benefits.\n\nI really feel there is such a strong link between carbs and dysregulated hormones. Keto has hugely helped with stabilisation of my binge tendencies (hormone related) and general perimenopausal issues.",

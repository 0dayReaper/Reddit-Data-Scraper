I'm currently living in isolated squalor with minimal functionality after gaining 35 lbs post-trauma. It's hard to witness. I'd really like to respect myself again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI intend to be diligently ketogenic for the rest of my life beginning tomorrow as I think I'm an individual that has no choice. I don't care, food has honestly ruined my life. I don't have a lot of faith that I can permit myself to succeed but I need to find a way--\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation/come to terms with this and been able to succeed? Or been able to succeed via any particular methods in general? How do you detach from the junk food dopamine? Lots and lots of love for this community, so grateful for the stories I've been able to read. &lt;3",

For most people the cravings will gradually go away. But just note, especially for those of us with BED, one slip and it all comes flooding back and can send us into a hard to break out of downward spiral.",

Lillys makes low sugar, chocolate, and stuff and there are a lot of sugar free options at Walmart. Just make sure you check the serving sizes and sugar alcohol because you will be farting or pooping for days if you overdo those. One of my favorites to keep at the house is raspberries and I will cover walnuts in sugar-free chocolate and then sprinkle on Chia seeds. Failure to plan is planning to fail. \n\nEdited to add : I would say my approach to keto is more no sugar, no starches because I don\u2019t track my carbs in most vegetables or dairy, and the first month or two I would say no to the artificial because my body thought it was getting sugar. If you can stick to it long enough, a lot of those intense craving subside, you just have to find a way to make it not miserable for you. Otherwise it can be too restrictive and we know how that ends.",

Both of which are considered ok for zerocarb and carnivore diets. Though cheese in moderation, and some leave off dairy entirely. \n\nKeep in mind that protien still has an insulin response. So eating a gram or two of carbs in a sitting more than likely won't affect many of the benefits of keto/carnivore unless you are sensitive to certain foods.\n\nI strongly advocate for a ketogenic carnivore diet with general keto being a fallback for people I know wouldn't give carnivore a chance. It may not be a bad idea to do strict carnivores (beef, butter, salt, water) for a few months, then add other foods slowly to see how you feel. Example, some people feel bad eating pork or have reactions to eggs or cheese, for some, even fiber can aggrivate symptoms. Either way, stick to whole foods and ditch the ultraprocessed junk.",

I\u2019m not sure how much carbs they get per day but I\u2019ve lost 30 pounds in four months in my mental health has improved dramatically.\n\nI struggle specifically with binge eating, and by cutting out sugars and starches, most of my binge foods were eliminated naturally. My best advice for sticking to it is to think about the pain it causes in your body due to inflammation. When I was doing it for weight loss, everything sucks but when I was doing it to feel better and be happy the weight just fell off. \n\nIt\u2019s also easier to just say no than to say I can have a little bit. One, because that little bit sets off all my cravings all over again and two it\u2019s hard to keep track of all those little bits and all of a sudden it\u2019s a lot of bits.",

For some trigger foods can include dairy so tgey nix rhat ad well. \n\nCarnivore usually focuses on rumenant animal meat, but doesnt have to exclusivly use it. In fact in some cases its unwise. There are cases of side effects of lyme disease causing a allwrgic reaction to mammal meat of any kind. People doing carnivore with that issue need to stick with poultry, fish, anphibians like frog, reptiles like allegator or snake, etc as their protien. Im mentioning frod and snake/allegator because i live in tx and deslite having a acersion to some of these myself or having never eaten them i do know they are good sources of protien amd some people love it. Im not a fan of eating insects or arachnids either despite the benefits that can have, but that also is carnivore if u want to get technical . \n\nThough with that, some people have a alletgic reaction to the chiton in their exoskelotons, which also is the leading cause of shellfish allergies . So yeah, not aleays the bezt option depemding on individual needs/preferances.\n\nIm nkt against game meat, i ate squirrel once while visiting relatives in west virginia ad a kid, ive been willing to try rattle snake, rabbit, possom, or raccoon and ive eaten deer a lot in my life . I have a eww factor avetsion to frog, like with arachnids and insects/worms, etc. Id only go that route if not doibg it risked starvation and i was out of options. But never wpukd it be remotly a go to option. \n\nMy area, we dont have allegator, except in select restraints that havr it shipped in. They do not exist locally at all. And while i am a city gal, i will not say im overly picky food wise. I have few aversions based on the eww factor, and some i simply do noy like or tolerate well.\n\nAnywho, i think doing bbbe to start with is ur best bet unless u have some sort of allergy to any of those foods. If that is a issue add something else thats animal protirn amd fits ur needs/goals/preferances. Expiriment to find what foods work best for u. \n\nBut i will say while carnivore is a offshoot of keto, its not keto while being keto. Its tge best eay to define it, part of the proper human diet spectrum but not really keto.\n\nI do agred with commentors suggesting u check carnivore subs or youtube channels. That way u are mlre informed on this subject.\n\nI lurk some in those circles deslite not doing catnivore because i have had nutrient deficiency issues and most of the nutrients i have issues absorbing are found in animal products and am trying to learn best from thay community how to balamce things to optimize my iwn health while balancing the roaf blocks from my mefical conditions causing the issue.\n\nAs a result, ive learned a lot of other intersting info on the subject and retained it simply out of facination.

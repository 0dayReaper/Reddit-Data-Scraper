    "postText": "Man, I am so thankful that I found the DIY ketochow recipe. I have wanted to try ketochow for a while, but due to where I live, shipping costs were quite prohibitive. \n\nOrdered up all the supplies I need and mixed up 2 weeks of powder. Been drinking it for 1 week now.  Doing well. I was already keto for about a month, but wanted to get a bit more serious with more control over numbers.\n\nSince I started keto about 5 weeks ago, I am down 9kgs and feeling pretty good. This is my 2nd run at keto, previously I did keto for a year and lost 30 or 35kgs. Then some crap happened and life got in the way. I decided to start again because of the benefits.\n\nNot only do I feel better, but while keto my asthma goes away. I have been on steroidal inhalers since 2013 and regular inhalers since elementary school. But while keto, I can stop my meds and have no breathing problems. It's such a life changer.\n\nMy plan is to continue exclusively drinking ketochow for at least another week and reevaluate. After that, if I decide to reintroduce food, it will be mostly on weekends. I am quite busy at work so ketochow for lunch and dinners on work days is just a lifesend. \n\nI do want to reintroduce food on the weekends mostly because I do love cooking. So I want to get back into cooking healthy keto friendly foods as well as fermentation. \n\nAnyways, glad to see such a wonderful community here and a huge thanks to the Ketochow company for posting up the diy version for us international people. \ud83d\ude0a",

This is why enriched products deliver only a usable fraction of what is on the label, and why the research on supplementation has shown it to be so disappointing.  So I personally would only use such products as a small part of my diet if I were going to use them, not for most of my nutrition.",

Both times happened with in a month of going keto. So there must be some allergen or reaction to sugars that increase inflammation or something. Honestly I don't care why, im just happy to not need daily meds. I do have a flare up from time to time, but I recover usually in under 5 minutes with no meds now. Pretty cool",

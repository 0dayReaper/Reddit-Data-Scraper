    "postText": "I\u2019ve been on keto for about 3 weeks now. The first 2 weeks I felt energized, have been going on 30-45 mins walk 5 days a week plus my home gym equipment same for 5 days a week. I\u2019m currently eating about 1500 calories a day with no more then 50carbs a day. I\u2019m 300+ lbs and have been losing weight fast but felt like I hit a wall now. I do struggle with sleep as well. Is this normal? What should I do? Any recommendations would be much appreciated.",

You don\u2019t need any fancy products or pills for sodium and potassium. Magnesium glycinate is very cheap on amazon to boot.\n\nThe keto flu is nothing more than electrolyte deficiency. It can happen anytime you are deficient, not just at the start. Google \u201cketoade recipes\u201d and start feeling better. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nThere\u2019s more info in the FAQ if you\u2019d like to know more:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq",

            "comment": "I think your problem is just too much carbs, too little electrolytes and too little calories.\n\nStarting with carbs 50gm of carbs is way too much for us, anyone over 300lbs has no business going near the limit because if we knew how to limit carbs we wouldn't have gone over. \nStart by lowering your carbs to 20 ignoring carbs inside meats and green veggies.\n(You should know the FDA allows a leeway of 20% error in product information reporting so you should assume that 8g carbs in a choco bar might very well be 10g and now you might be over the carb limit )\n\nGoing over the 50gm carb limit will knock you out of ketosis, so the only energy you'll get will be your blood sugar and since that will be low cause you're not consuming much carbs hence low energy.\nThe carbs are a limit not an allowance...\n\nAlso salt... Increase your consumption of it, specially along with your proteins sprinkle on every bite until you no longer feel like you need salt then stop (salt is regulated by your body and if you feel you need salt always get some) \n\n\nLastly you're way going under your calorie target deficit you can eat at 2500 calories and still lose weight at the recommended (1% of total weight per week).",

I've been meticulously tracking that and eat zero fruit because I choose the net carbs in broccoli, zucchini, etc. I assume with meats you mean just natural meat products and that I sadly have to count the 3 carbs in the chicken apple sausages I love so much. \ud83d\ude04",

            "comment": "300+ lbs person at only 1500 cals a day, means you are not getting enough fat for energy. The lack of energy you feel is from the cal restriction. The \"wall\" you hit is likely your body resisting the weight lost out of fear of starvation, If you persist with your current cal count, you will break through that wall. Offhand guess with what little information you gave, you are probably at a 3500 cal maint (with the walking and home gym equipment) and have been doing a 2000 cal deficit for an extended time. You would probably feel a lot better adding 500 or so cals back in your diet. Also 50 carbs feels like a lot, so I would double check total caloric intake. I would also lower carbs and increase fat/protein. 1500 cal with 50 carbs, i would be curious to see how much protein you are actually getting.",

I am 33 days in and had a 5 day stall, but now going down again.  Make sure you are getting enough salt and other minerals.  That can make you tired it you  aren't getting enough.  You got. this!",

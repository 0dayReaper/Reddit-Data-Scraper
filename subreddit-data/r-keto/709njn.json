    "postText": "Actually, it took me 8 months and a week to lose 127 pounds ... but who's counting?\n\n\nIn Jan, doc said my only hope was bariatric surgery - thank god I found Diet Doctor and this sub before I had a portion of a vital organ removed permanently.  \n\n\n235 has been a marker in my head for a while because in January it seemed like such a dream weight - an impossible thing to achieve.  And yet, here I am, 8 months (and one week) later standing **IN** the pants I wore to that doctor's appointment ... \n\nThanks Keto!\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BY_Wqe2BKKI/?taken-by=eatbaconloseweight",

I think comparing before and after photos side by side made the biggest difference. The rest was just time, I think.   It's strange because when I look at my original \"before\" photos, I don't think I ever realized quite how heavy I was. I suppose it was because I gained weight so gradually over the years. I barely recognize the person I see in my before photos, especially the face. I feel like I never really saw that person in the mirror at the time, maybe denial or something.\n\nI think day to day things helped as well, like needing to buy new clothes because the old ones were starting to look comical, or realizing that I could fit better in a restaurant booth. My partner would make comments like \"there's no way you could have walked this long before, you would have had to sit down a bunch of times by now\". I guess just small things over time",

That cuts out a lot of the junk if you can stick to it. Ego depletion and decision fatigue can make it hard for many to do so and the surgeries available make it less of a struggle.",

Her doctor basically told her the same thing.\n\nThe hard part for her is that she already believed it was impossible for her to get there on her own. I get the feeling. I can't concentrate when I'm hungry. I have done keto before and I like it, but I am often uncomfortable because I'm craving carbs. I've eaten two pork chops and six servings of vegetables and felt a strange combination of full and famished at the same time, because my body wanted something else.\n\nOur modern world works against our instincts and biology in almost every way. It's even been shown in a study that merely thinking about being \"poor\" is enough to make people crave empty calories. Probably an adaptive trait for our ancestors - thinking about a lean winter led to trying to put on more weight while you can.\n\nSo now we have food EVERYWHERE and most of it is TERRIBLE from a health perspective, but our bodies think it's great - fat, sugar, salt, ENERGY. But we don't need it. There won't be a lean winter, there won't be a famine, in all likelihood. The worst most of us will face is possibly being so broke we can't get 50 cent tacos.\n\nThat's what the sleeve would offer her - freedom from her body telling her she's hungry at inappropriate times and for unhealthy things.",

And I'm not trying to ketoevangelize, I'm really not, but keto 10000% gave me the freedom from not being hungry AND not having any cravings.  \n\nNow ... there hasn't been enough research done on the ghrelin hormone (the way I understand it) when it comes to weight loss surgery.  Do post-surgery patients experience the loss of hunger because of ghrelin OR because they are essentially on a very low carb diet?  And it's been said that the hunger DOES come back ... is that because those same patients re-introduce carbs at a later date?\n\nI don't profess to know all the answers - or even 1% of them - but it's something to think about.",

For many many many people, Surgery *is* the right way.\n\n\nI've done Keto before and after Bariatric Surgery and without my surgery, I wouldn't have been able to 1) keep the weight off long term, 2) been able to control my portion sizes, 3) avoid the massive cravings I'd develop and 4)  I've been able to greatly exceed the results of my surgery with my diet and exercise.\n\nI failed to keep the weight off twice using Keto diets. Not because Keto didn't work, but because my body fought me until I couldn't fight back. It was part of a larger issue with my body, and diet (and exercise) alone wasn't the answer for me.\n\nBariatric Surgery was the *only* way to allow my body to work with me, not against me, and together I've been successful. \n\n\nIn the 7 months since my surgery (I did a newer procedure called the [Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty ](http://www.houstonweightlossuthealth.com/bariatric-surgery/endosleeve.html) yes, nothing was removed from me, but my stomach has been sewn from the inside to make a sleeve.) and I've lost 142 pounds and counting. 50 pounds is the average amount of weight loss for the surgery. \n\n \nI've done this with exercise and a great Keto diet. My Doctor has told me that I am one of the top weight losers *in the world* for this procedure and I credit that partly to my diet, which is effectively Keto. \n\nI am now training for a 50mile walk through the NZ wilderness on a famous walk, I will hit the 150 pound lost mark very soon. That procedure saved my life.\n\nSurgery is not for everyone, I get that. But please don't say that surgery is bad, or wrong, or say things that make people feel ashamed because they may need the surgery to help them. Bariatric Surgery is an amazing tool and we shouldn't feed a stereotype that surgery is wrong or incorrect or a negative thing to agree to.\n\n\nIf anyone is contemplating Surgery,  there is no shame in pursuing  Surgery as an option. And please reach out if you need support. Please feel free to message me if you need to talk. \n\nYour weight loss is awesome, and I'm so proud of you all, just remember there are many valid and positive paths to a healthy, and happy weight loss and weight maintenance. Keto is one, Bariatric Surgery is another. Using both is yet still another. \n\nThanks for listening. \n\n\n\n( edit: That moment when you realise you need to change your flair)",

I just wanted to be that voice of support for those who feel ashamed of their Surgery, or the thought of having one to help them. \n\n*The* biggest topic I talk about with Sleevers when it's comes to the social aspect of Bariatric Surgery is effectively \"Coming out.\" There is so much shame and fear surrounding surgery and the snarky comments cut deep. There are people scared to tell their spouses. \n\nIt's funny, I feel like being an out gay man helped me with coming out and being an advocate about Bariatric Surgery people. I just hope that talking openly about it takes away the negative stereotypes people have about it and encourages others to see it as an option. ",

My procedure had me as an overnight patient, and I was back to work in 3 days. \n\n[current stats put survival rates for Bariatric Surgery at 99.8%](http://www.bariatric-surgery-source.com/gastric-bypass-surgery-deaths.html) \n\nYour chances of obesity related death is much higher. \n\n\nGenerally the order of \"Risk\" is ESG -&gt; Keyhole Sleeve -&gt; Gastric Bypass. \n\nI personally went with the least risky option that did not remove any of the stomach, only internally sewed into a sleeve. That option also had the \"least effectiveness\" but I kinda destroyed that thought with my results. \n\nAlso there are Bariatric surgeries they no longer do. The Lap band for example is no longer done in most places because it's not a good tool for almost anyone. \n\nThis doesn't diminish your loss, I'm so sorry for that. \n\nSurgery is a big decision and shouldn't be taken lightly. Always do your research and talk/consult with your doctor. And decide what risk is comfortable for you. I'm not going to lie. I was nervous. I was worried at moments before the surgery. But for me (and the vast majority of people), the surgery and the after effects will not be fatal. ",

Surgery is not an easy path to weight loss. \n\nAgain, Just like a Hammer is not the best tool in every situation, neither is Keto, ( orSurgery) the best tool for everyone.\n\nPeople look at Keto negatively and say things like it's a fad diet or a lazy way to lose weight. Let's not be like like that towards others. We should all support each other in their weight loss journey no matter what tools they use. \n\nLet's build each other up, not tear others down to make our achievements seem better. \n\nThanks for listening.

It's about cutting out carbs that some people are not genetically evolved to process. Instead of having 15 copies of the AMY1 gene, they may have only one. Therefore, their body does not produce amylase in their saliva to break down starch, so the body can't digest it to provide energy, so stashes it away as body fat instead. \n\nUnfortunately the low fat diet started by Ancel Keys encourages people to eat more carbs instead. Hence the obesity epidemic.\n\nAncel Keys has been responsible for more deaths that Hitler. He was paid by the sugar industry to blame Something Else other than sugar for the rising rate of heart disease, in order to exonerate sugar. So he picked saturated fat instead. Then persuaded the government and entire medical profession to believe him, leading a smear campaign against the doctors and scientists who said that it was sugar that was causing all the trouble, not fat.

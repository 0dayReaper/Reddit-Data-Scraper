    "postText": "So, my life was kind of at a rock bottom. I had a spouse who regularly threatened me, controlled me, and manipulated me. So, I ate. \n\nNow, I'd always been a big guy all my adult life (over 300 lbs), but when I was eating to cope, I ate so much, that one day when I stepped on a scale, I realized I had ballooned up to almost 350 lbs. \n\nI had done Keto once before, very successfully, so I wanted to start again. The last time I only stopped because my spouse demanded it. \n\nWell, this time I stopped listening. Not just about the food. I took my life back, filed for divorce, and ate what I chose to eat. \n\nI didn't even buy a scale. After moving out, I had very little. I slept on a folded up blanket on the floor for the first month. I had to make sure my child had everything he needed, first. A scale just wasn't a priority. I was eating Keto because it made me feel better. The number didn't matter. \n\nI don't track my carbs or my calories. I just stick to low carb foods and I eat when I'm hungry. That's it. \n\nSo, in an effort to get some sort of furniture together, I went down to the Salvation Army store. And on the shelf there, there was a bathroom scale. \n\nI thought, \"I've never been under 300 lbs, in my adult life. It would be awesome if I was down to 299 by now.\" \n\nSo I got on the scale, just to see, with clothes and shoes and everything. \n\nI was convinced it was broken. I ended up having to ask someone else to stand on it (someone who knew what they weighed) to make sure it worked. \n\nI'm 279 lbs. I don't even know how to process that. \n\nI'm getting my life back, slowly, and it is hard to think about all the time I wasted not doing the things I needed to for myself. But this is one I will stick to.\n\nEdit: Omg, gold? Thank you. The outpouring of support from this community has been heart-warming. Thank you all. I'm replying to everyone I can. It might take a while but I'll get to you all!",

Keto really is helping me through a dark time in my life, and it's helped me turn the worst thing that could happen to me (so I thought)  into a way to overcome fear and feel good about myself again.

Where I live you have to be separated for a year to get a divorce. That's where I'm at now. I would say it took about 3 months to realize what I had to do. But technically I haven't done it yet. But man I feel better just being away. I left her our farm and everything in it. She hadn't had a job in years and I had taken care of everything... and I just walked away from everything except our daughter. \nThings are good now. I have my little girl half the time. I just got done making us our sausage and scrambled eggs with cheese, were watching scooby doo and I am happy. Hope you are too friend!",

That's exactly what I did. \n\nI actually served her with papers right after she threatened to kill me, in front of my son (Where he's at an age now that he understands that stuff. His grandmother's dog had just passed away, and we'd discussed death and such with him, so he gets it). So he was understandably upset. And I didn't stand up to her at the time, I just backed away and apologized as if I did something wrong, because I didn't want to upset her more. \n\nBut that was the line I couldn't come back from. I'll never let him see his father be treated that way again. I don't want him growing up thinking it is okay for someone to treat him that way, or worse, for him to treat someone else that way. I served her with papers and moved out a few days later.",

Heck, large swaths of society will cheer on the woman and blame the man when *he* is the victim.  The legal system: Police, judges, social workers, sometimes the written law itself... Many are predisposed to believe the woman is the victim and the man a liar.\n\nI found this out the hard way five years ago.\n\nBut.... \n\nLike your weight, it gets better.  Slowly, perhaps at times imperceptibly; but it gets better.\n\nI don't know what all you're going through, but I have a couple of bits of advice, worth every penny you've paid for them.\n\nFirst... Try some counseling.  It sounds like you've been through some mental and emotional trauma, and it's no more a weakness to get help with it than it would be to get help moving a 300 lb sleeper sofa up two flights of stairs. \n\nSecond, try to avoid the worst of the corners of the internet that focus on men's rights.  Some have good information, but many of them go right off the deep end and assume all women are crazy, abusive manipulators, instead of helping deal with the fallout from the rare *one* that is.  The kind of advice they give might *feel* good, but it's never gonna help you heal and eventually develop healthy relationships.\n\nAnd, if you just wanna chat, hit me up. My head was twisted for a bit, but I have come out the other side.",

Hopefully this will help us remain amicable with regard to co-parenting my son. And who knows, maybe she will actually be able to change herself. I don't know. \n\nIn my one-on-one meeting with the counselor she brought up something very similar, because I'd mentioned how I felt guilty for leaving, how I felt like sometimes I questioned if I was doing the right thing or not, when people would start asking me questions. \n\nShe just flat out said it was a double standard. How if I was the woman and I'd said my spouse threatened me and abused me, and I left them, no one would be pressuring me to 'work it out' with them. \n\nAs for the men's right's groups... lord, you aren't wrong. That sort of toxic hatred doesn't help anyone. I don't hate my spouse. I never have, maybe that's weird. I just feel sad I didn't leave sooner, and I don't wish her ill, I just hope she finds a way to get control of her anger and anxiety. (Her fits of rage are, in my opinion, caused by really bad anxiety).",

I decided one day to see if it still worked, I was curious since I had been doing keto with IF for over a month. I thought it wouldn't even matter since it only goes up to 400 lbs, I was so sure I was over that since I had been for years (peak 440 in 2017). I stepped on and it said 379. Surely it must be broken or maybe it's my bathroom floor that is messed up. So, I took the scale outside and put it on the concrete. Same result. Still didn't buy it, must not be zeroed correctly. I had a physical scheduled in a few weeks, so I decided I would find out for sure then. Kept periodically seeing what the scale read, number kept getting lower. I knew I was losing weight but I didn't trust the scale. Went to my physical and, lo and behold, my scale was right. I was down to 369 at the office.",

            "comment": "I had a relationship end after 10 years last summer. My ex was totally against diet and exercise, but would still comment on my weight even though I wanted to explore those things, including keto. She'd hate on vegans, dieters, etc. She then cheated on me and i broke it off. Now she's with a coke dealer who her family hates &amp; I was recently a groomsman at her brother's wedding because her family loves me. She looks terrible and I'm 80 lb lighter and have an incredible, big hearted, smart girlfriend now.\n\nI know my story is different from yours, but I really identified with your post. Im now the fittest and happiest I've ever been in my life. Keep at it, brother and hit me up if you ever want to talk or gloat, I understand what you're going through and would love another keto buddy!",

I'll admit, though, I don't know if I'll ever really 'date' again. At least I'm not in a place where that is something I can really think about realistically at the moment. Maybe some day. Right now I'm just happy living a good healthy life and spending time with my son.",

One day, I met a woman and we became friends, but eventually were really attracted to one another. Yes, this community is wonderful... i love the information and encouragement i get here and I know i wouldn't be where im at now without it. Best of luck, bud, you deserve all the good things, but most importantly you're out there actively getting them for yourself and your son. &lt;3",

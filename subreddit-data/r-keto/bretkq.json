    "postText": "So I'm fat.  So are mom, dad, brothers, sister, cousins and grandparents.  And then there is the diabetes.  Diagnosed, grandma, dad, mom, 3 uncles, and both brothers.  Dead from diabetes, grandma and oldest brother. Incapacitated from stroke dad and uncle. \n\nOk so knowing this history you'd think we would as a group change the way we eat.  Research, read, study, try something so we all don't die.  But no it's just pills and doctor visits and death.  \n\nAbout a year ago I started eating Keto.  I've been to the doctor.  I've lowered my  blood pressure, cholesterol, and my a1c is a 5.  I feel better mentally than I have my entire life.  The constant pain and depression is gone.  I only lost 35 pounds.  I'm still fat, but I feel so damn healthy.  I sleep better, when I'm awake I'm actually awake.  I get stuff done.  Being alive feels good. \n\nSo to continue with my family story, I went to a wedding shower for my niece.  They had a \"pasta bar\" and a \"dessert bar\"  Holy shit, it was carbs as far as they eye could see.  Being the rude bitch I am (according to people who think it's rude not to accept the hospitality) I didn't eat anything.  I drank black coffee and watched my mother eat. And eat she did, penne Alfredo, lasagna, breadsticks, and cake.  20 min later she was in my car literally crying.  Sweaty, cold, red, nauseous, dizzy.  I probably should have taken her to the hospital.  She was crying \"my body has betrayed me!\"  It was horrible.  And I was angry.  Why does she do this to herself? Why do my family think this is ok? She texted me a day later and said \"for some reason my blood sugar spiked\"  Really mom?? For some reason?\n\nShe's 28 years older than me.  I'm going to eat low carb for the next 30 years and enjoy the next 30  years of my life.  I fucking refuse to do that to myself.  I am NOT going to die like that.  I'm going to change my family.  My son is not going to be fat and diabetic.  Hes not going to have to watch me suffer in 30 years.  I am going to break this cycle.  Watch me.",

My parents (particularly my mom) saw her future if she wasn\u2019t careful. Already losing her parents to diabetes she became a health freak. So much so, that she influenced my dad too. So what\u2019s the story here? Well, my parents both are diabetes free &amp; raised three kids who are also diabetes free. She was able to influenced her sisters to jump on bored too. It all starts with one person &amp; I believe your lifestyle change will be contagious and overtime will help your family.",

Even though the changes they have made are tiny and probably not helping. Mostly I wanted to say thanks because I too am fat. Most of the past 3 years I have eaten very low carb and Keto. I tend to beat myself up because the outside of me isn\u2019t a good example to anyone. You reminded me that it\u2019s ok. I\u2019m doing good for myself and , while I may not be the best ambassador for the Keto lifestyle, I am sooo much healthier...for me.",

It's best to increase veggie intake, eat smaller portions, and work out. The Mediterranean diet + exercise has had huge successs at our clinic. Just a thought. Keep up the good work!! I'm so happy to see your improvement!!!",

We switched their food for the first time in YEARS b/c their old food was discontinued. One of the cats started losing weight. He was eating, drinking, BMing, and behaving normally. Still, after he shed probably 5 lb, we started to worry he was sick.\n\nSo we took him to the vet. The vet showed us a chart of feline weight. Our cat was at the IDEAL weight. Perfect weight. She said, \"nine out of ten household cats are overweight. Nobody knows what a healthy cat looks like anymore.\"\n\nWhen I still had ~10lb to lose to get to my current weight, my mom said \"You're not going to lose any more weight, are you?\" She was worried I was taking things to extremes. She'd never seen me at this weight before, because I'd never been this skinny in my entire adult life. She didn't know what a healthy ME looked like. She wants me as happy and as healthy as I can be. But just b/c she wants that doesn't mean she knows what it looks like. Bless her, she's making the effort to learn, once I reassured her my body is doing well at this weight (blood markers &amp; symptoms are all great).",

He had lost almost 30-40 lbs! WTH, I was feeling like shit and had a very stressful project I was working in Brazil. So I said fuck it, what better place to try this crazy FAD diet than Brazil. \n\nSo off I went on my Keto journey. Started at 300 and got down to 208. Put some back on, but I lift constantly. Here is the cool thing, all of my immediate family started to lose the weight. For the boys, it was just limited the Carbs overall, but not strictly Keto. We have turned around as a family and made huge strides on our health. Keep on trucking, your family may or may not follow. But it\u2019s worth it in the end.",

I hate to say this but part of me feels embarrassed and the other part is sad because it\u2019s like she\u2019s hurting herself just to be reactionary and oppositional against our healthy changes. She also has pretty severe mobility problems due to bad hips and obesity, and doctors have all told her it would be easier for her to walk if she loses some weight. Instead she\u2019s 62 with a handicap placard and barely gets around with a cane. I think I\u2019m also kinda mad that she\u2019s doing this to herself instead of trying to get healthy for her grandkids.",

I remember that he had so many people that wanted him to lose weight, so many people that gave him chances to put in the effort and he refused.I remembered when he would want to do stuff with us but couldn't because he wasn't mobile. He would reminisce about the good old days when he could do shit, then feel bad that he took his mobility for granted. \n\nI will never take my mobility for granted, I want to take care of my body and stay mobile for as long as possible\n\nBut even more importantly, you can't change people, you can only learn from their mistakes. Also leading by example is more effective than lecturing. Monkey see Monkey do. They are more likely to change if they see you doing the same thing and can copy you.

Some people get fat when they eat crap - for me, its mental instability - depression, thoughts of suicide. I already lost a sister to suicide, and another sister is constantly in and out of psych wards; my father is clinically depressed, 3/4 of my uncles are bipolar, and I have several cousins who are schizophrenic and several other cousins who have attempted suicide. Mental illness is rampant in my family but I will do EVERYTHING in my power to give myself an advantage. This means eating CLEAN always! No \"cheat days\", no \"its only once in a while, it won't kill me\" type mentality. Healthy eating (and DAILY exercise) is like a religion for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think of this as a war with drugs.... very tasty drugs. I always make my own food, or I go to the supermarket and just eat a bunch of fruit and raw leaves if I have to - I never eat at restaurants or at events, and trust me, people DO get offended. Oh well, you have to make sacrifices in life and this is one is a pretty good one to make, in my opinion.",

Yesterday it was Taco Bell. Usually it\u2019s Wendy\u2019s. Mom and brother are the only ones with truly concerning problems, but dad is prediabetic. They. Will. Not. Change. My mom has been reduced to tears at me offering her a piece of buttered broccoli. It\u2019s ruined a lot of things, mostly because I\u2019m probably an asshole. I just feel like it\u2019s my duty to save my family. They know how great my numbers are,  BP: 116/64, alc 4.9, triglycerides: 32, and yet none of them even want to talk about it, they\u2019re not interested in the least in adopting a diet similar to mine, and they viciously argue with me at every mention of  it . It breaks my heart, but I\u2019m not stopping anything I\u2019ve done. You shouldn\u2019t either, just keep it up!! It sounds like we have a similar mindset, I refuse to live the way my family does, the way I did in the past.  Don\u2019t lose focus and just know that the best thing you can do is to live life well, like you seem to be, best of luck!",

If they press me I let them know that I cook all my own meals. \n\nI use now liquid Stevia for when I need to eat something that tastes sweet.

Turns out my \"athletic build\" is actually classic hourglass and my body shaming female relatives are salty af about it. Now I am \"too thin\" and anorexic apparently. My mother had a temper tantrum because I bought an XS dress and she bought a S. The whole time she was scoffing at me and giving me side eye. We try on our dresses and mine fits perfectly. Hers does not and she's too embarrassed to take it back and tries to palm it off on me. \n\n\nThey're all pre-diabetic as well. I get told I'm going to the because I eat too many eggs.\n\n\nSorry for the rant, your post reminded me of the rage I feel towards my salty sabotaging and shaming family.\n\n\nI'm glad you are breaking the cycle.

We've been blessed with good metabolism and being born in a country where most meals are cooked at home, and fast food was prohibitively expensive. \n\nBut still, I was raised with sugar and carbs. Specially being raised in a very poor family, we eat bread rolls with eggs regularly. Often a lot more bread than eggs, since an egg cost $1 while a bread roll costs $0.30\n\nOne of my favorite breakfasts growing up was a bread roll with margarine and sugar. You read that right.\n\nAnd I was fine with it all because I'd look at the food pyramid and think that I was supposed to be eating all those carbs. Even more carbs than vegetables!!\n\nAnd when I decided to get healthier two years ago, I got healthier with whole foods... Mostly carbs still, though!!\n\nAnd I was getting fatter and fatter (peaking at 140 lbs at 5'4\"). Until I randomly came across a channel on YouTube called \"What I've learned\", that explained how the food pyramid is wrong. I was so mad! How dare they spread misinformation like that!",

            "comment": "By far the biggest problem is that people don't understand the relationship between diet and health.\n\n What people think that means is \"eat more of this and less of this and you have a better chance of avoiding long-term diseases\". What it *actually* means is your food choices drastically impact how tired/sick or energetic/healthy you feel, and those two states in turn are predictors of long-term health.\n\nCompounding the problem is a lack of diet knowledge in general. Outside of keto, it's not well-known that sugar will spike insulin and make you tired. People don't know that starchy foods like bread and pasta will turn into sugar. People definitely don't know that condiments are full of sugar and processed meats are full of starch. People don't understand the relationship between protein and satiety / blood-sugar control, they may not even recognize what foods actually have significant protein (cheese for example is a much denser source than peanut butter, eggs are pretty low in the grand scheme of things, beans are ridiculously low). There's also a huge amount of misinformation surrounding nutrition -- everyone \"knows\" that vegetables are high in nutrition, but they don't realize that it's mostly vitamin k and c (sometimes vitamin a). Meanwhile they don't realize that meat is packed with minerals like iron, b vitamins, potassium, etc. Cheese is high in calcium, vitamin a, phosphorus, etc. Seeds and nuts are considered \"snacks\" but their nutritional profile *dwarfs* the contribution of whole grains. People don't realize that cereal nutrients are sprayed on and so a lot less bioavailable. And so on. \n\nAdd all of this together and *of course* people just assume it's their bodies that are betraying them. There's just not enough knowledge there to put the pieces together. People might get a sense that fast food and soda are \"bad\" but not really understand why, or what that even means. I feel like it's our duty as ketoers to at least explain it -- we don't have to proselytize our way of life, but we can at least give people the information that we've learned. We can maybe contribute in some way to their own self-realizations and their own lifestyle changes.",

I\u2019ve been able to keep at or near a healthy weight most of my life, but it\u2019s been hard work fighting the habits that we all grew up with. Recently I lost about 20lbs fast (divorce stress) and my brother started calling me Karen Carpenter (an anorexic actress) even though I\u2019m 5\u20197 and 160lbs. I lift weights and have a lot of muscle so this is a great weight for me, and I look damn good, but not at all scrawny. It was frustrating because he\u2019s put on a lot of weight over the last few years and I worry about his health, but then he\u2019s kind of a jerk, too.",

Coming from a Latino background we were also taught it\u2019s rude to not eat all the food you\u2019re given. \n\nAfter I moved out of my parents home, I found keto not too long after that. To this day I\u2019ve lost 42 lbs and feel great! My parents? Still stuck in the same cycle of eating way too much, especially food that\u2019s bad for you all the time. I worry for them but I\u2019ve tried so many times to get them to change that it\u2019s basically not worth it at this point. Good on you for finding your own path! We are all on similar journeys and we\u2019ll enjoy the ride.",

We of all people know what that struggle is like. We can guide with the empathy and compassion they will get from no where else.\n\nHave you watched any of nurse Cindy\u2019s YouTube vids? She helped a bunch of her family do Keto, and they have lost hundreds upon hundreds of pounds together as a family. But I think her example spurred the change in them. Maybe she can help you find a way to connect to your dear family about how to change their lives, so you keep them around a bit longer.\n\nI get the rage. I now want to hug every obese person on the street I see. They are not the problem, the system and the government endorsed way of eating in our county is the problem. It has failed them, it failed us. I am hoping to do my best for my overweight friends and loved ones, once I lose enough weight and they believe this crazy Keto thing works, to lead by quiet example and support. Even if they find another WOE, I want to be that desperately needed cheerleader in their lives to know they can do it, they are worth it.",

Not to say she's blameless. No one deliberately hurts themselves. Theres a reason so many sad people are also overweight. Sometimes food is the only thing that makes you feel better. Hopefully you can encourage her to eat better \u2661 congrats on your weight loss too.",

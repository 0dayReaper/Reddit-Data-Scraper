    "postText": "Yesterday I had 1 low carb meal salad olive oil and vinegar dressing with ground beef on side at 8pm.  Drank low carb protein shake at 9 am this morning and nothing else so far today (7:30 PM) except a glass of water with ACV, a twist of fresh lemon and a Tablespoon of MCT oil.  Tested with keto mojo right after and was at 80 glucose and .8 ketones.  Went for a 7 mile bike ride and worked out with weights for about 25 min.  As soon as I got home from that I tested again and I was at 93 glucose and .4 ketones.  I am new to this but that seems to go against everything I have learned so far.  Any insight is welcomed.  Thank you all in advance.",

I noticed eating drinking pretty much anything that isn't pure fat and water knocks me out of ketosis for a time but really depends on goals. autophagy may not be your goal but seems like that is what you may be after.   \n\n\nFrom what I understand if you reach a point of huffing and puffing for air you are going to get low on ketones, high intensity burst training is what advice I have seen to minimize this.  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYNDfEMM-Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYNDfEMM-Q)  \n\n\nI think though as long as you are burning ketones at all you are doing great! we are metabolically flexible creatures, and we make glucose just by waking up so don't fret about the numbers to much. Just avoiding grains and sugar and its sweet substitutes is a huge boost to your body's natural healing functions.",

Occasionally I will have something small that is less that 5g of carbs in the morning if needed.  \n\nI am not so much fretting about the numbers because I am losing weight consistently and I am keeping carbs very low around 20g a day, no grains, no sugar etc.  I am more fascinated by the process and trying to understand how it works... the mechanics of it.  That is how my brain works I guess lol.  I found some info that made sense and matched my results.  I think because I had just stopped working out my body was using up the ketones faster than they were being produced.  About 1.5 hrs after that first test I was up to a 1.6 reading.  Thanks again!",

It has something to do with how fine the powder is processed and how the body reacts to it. This is because there is no amount of chewing that could recreate a powder consistency.

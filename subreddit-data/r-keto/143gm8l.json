    "postText": "Hey there. I lost 6lb my first week of Keto. I\u2019m a 24 yr old female, my height is 5\u20193 and my current weight is 213lb.  I eat at most 1600 kcal a day and I typically try following 75-20-5 method for my keto diet. I\u2019m on week 3 and I havent lost really anything since then. Week 2 had me gaining almost all the weight I lost back, these past couple of days I lost the weight I re-gained but now it feels like my weight has stopped. I can\u2019t go past 212 (I started at 218). Everytime I get down to 212 it jumps back up. Im not seeing new progress. Does anyone have advice?",

Smaller ladies have it rough, we\u2019ve got to be stricter with our calories to see progress. \n\nAlso, throw those percentages out because they\u2019re only relevant for those doing keto for medical purposes (like controlling epilepsy). Here are where your macros should be in grams calculated at a 20% deficit:\n\n1587kcal Daily Calorie Intake\n\n20g Carbs (80 kcal)\n\n120g Protein (480 kcal)\n\n114g Fat (1027 kcal)\n\nMeet/exceed 120g protein every day because protein is your only goal. Fat is a limit, not a goal, so once you\u2019ve hit your protein goal you simply fill the rest of your calories in with fat *only as needed* to satiety. \n\nAnd definitely invest in a food scale, use it for everything. A tracking app may be more efficient and convenient than writing things down, I always recommend Cronometer as it lets you set your own macros in grams AND it tracks important micronutrients like sodium, potassium, etc.",

So for example, breakfast I\u2019ll eat 4-6 cuts of bacon and a Keto Bagel (7g net carbs) and I\u2019ll regularly drink my water with 2 tbsp of chia seeds (about 2.1g net carbs). I dont really snack throughout the day cuz it keeps me full til dinner around 7:30ish. I\u2019ll eat Salmon (no sauce just seasoning) and some Cauliflower Rice (about 1/2 to a cup). If I do eat a snack or dessert, it\u2019d be 1 serving of Rebel Keto Ice Cream. 1 serving is 1.4 net carbs and 210 kcal. So pretty much thats one example of how I eat for the day.",

I recommend a Salad to replace them, preferably one with a wide range of veggies including the cruciferous vegetables.    \nYou can actually season your salmon with like butter, lemon juice, parsley, stuff like that.      \nSince you're already eating 2 meals a day, I recommend you eat within a 8 hour interval to feel the lasting effects of Intermittent Fasting.     \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qifg5hxnlJE",

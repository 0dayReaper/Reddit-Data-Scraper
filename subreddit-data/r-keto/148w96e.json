I am new to keto and have been advised that it is the best diet to reverse insulin resistance. \n\nHow long does it take to reverse insulin resistance with keto and a low calorie diet? I am specifically asking about getting fasting insulin levels down.  Please help",

            "comment": "Insulin can lower pretty quickly, but insulin resistance is multi-factorial, driven primarily by the standard western diet high in ultra-processed foods. Depending on how long you\u2019ve had high insulin levels, it will probably take at least that long to reverse it, in a real sense. But go back to the standard western diet and it will come back. It\u2019s not a one and done thing to reverse the metabolic damage.",

In ketosis, the excess glucose is no longer excess and that reduces the hyperinsulinemia fairly quickly for most people.\n\nFixing the underlying issue - the fatty liver - takes longer, and there isn't good research on how long that takes nor even how possible it is to do that.\n\nWhat does seem to be quite certain is that if people go back to eating the way they did before they will become insulin resistant pretty quickly.",

It\u2019s an adjustment and you need to give your body the calories it needs while making that transition.",

If you lose enough weight to burn off all that visceral fat theoretically things will go back to normal but the fat loss is the key, as for how much time it takes after the fat is lost I\u2019m not 100% sure.\n\nYou can add insulin sensitivity to the body overall by exercising more and at least that will make your muscle tissue more sensitive, although not sure how effective that is in ketosis since I know ketosis causes peripheral insulin resistance in skeletal muscle tissue.",

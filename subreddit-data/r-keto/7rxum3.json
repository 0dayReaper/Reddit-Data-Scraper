    "postText": "Hey keto friends! I wanted to share over here what I shared in another similar diet subreddit, because it was just as much your community and support system here that got me to where I am today!\n\n**TLDR: Picture album at the bottom.**\n\nThings start pretty fast if you are scheduled for a morning run. You get to the hospital and into the surgical pre-op staging room. Here you get to meet all the wonderful people like your nurses, assistant anesthesiologist, anesthesiologist, surgeon and more. Each of which you will end up forgetting. They ended up putting the IV in my foot, which I hear is rare, as they would be flipping me around like a short order cook making pancakes through the procedure. One of the final things that happened is my surgeon came along with his purple crayons and did some impressionistic art on me. Anyways, shortly after this I was wheeled away and honestly taken to what I assume was the surgical theater, after this photo was taken, I don't remember a thing that happened to me.\n\nIt's one of the most jarring things I can think of in life, coming out of a fog where you just feel lost and cheated of your time on earth. Before you open your eyes you can think of nothing but a void, no dreams or thoughts happened. To me, I just ceased to exist at this time. I was pretty out of it, but I remember my mom telling me that things didn't exactly go as planned. The surgeon said he wanted to do a perfect job, and to do so required him making the planned surgery go from 3.5 hours to 7. And in this time he took away 10lbs of skin, repaired my abdominal muscle wall (OWE), relocated my nipples, and gave me a brand new belly button. I later found out that scheduling was pretty upset at him because there was another procedure lined up after me. He ended up buying the nurses for me and the patient after a bunch of pizza to make up for the long hours!\n\nDue to the time I had been out and under anesthesia, and the amount of work he did on me and took away from me, the doctor ordered that I remain overnight. Normally it's a same day surgery, unfortunately not for me. He was worried I'd have some severe pain as well as a lot of recovering to do from the trauma I incurred (thankfully, I only lost 1/2 unit of blood. How do they measure that by the way?). Next thing I remember from my brief moment of existence in the surgical recovery room was waking up in the main hospital. It was here I spent the next 20 or so hours where I thankfully had some of the best nurses looking after me. Here actually my main pain was from the gas that was building up inside my gut, and my inability of being able to use my abdominal muscles. I didn't care about the pain, they just plain would not respond to me! Also, after countless IV's and cups of water with out output on my end, they gave me an ultimatum. Pee in this hand held urinal sometime soon, or we are going to have to catheterize you. That got my body working it's #1 pipes again at least.\n\nAs nice as it is to be waited on and taken care of by professionals, I wanted out of that place. I despise IV's and the burning they leave in your hand, and the thought of the infection found there just gives me nightmares. Though, they did prepare a pretty solid clam chowder. While my blood pressure kept dropping on each vitals readings, it finally stabilized as long as I kept my compression binder on (within those first 24 hours I would very nearly pass out, get clammy, go def/blind if it got taken off). Walking a bit with the nurses and getting a brief checkup from the surgeon though I was finally discharged! The ride home was full of cursing each bump and pothole my wonderful city takes pains to maintain. But I made it, and into what ended up being the most wonderful recovery bed/recliner that I lived in for about three days.\n\nSince then I've thankfully progressed enough to consider myself more or less independent and moved bad at my own apartment, just needing assistance here and there from my roommate. I'm surprised by the pain to be honest, if I'm not up and about I'm really quite comfortable if not for the er, well severe (medically worrying constipation), I'd be quite content. I thank my surgeon so much for his expertise and the techniques he says he uses to minimize the pain the patient feels after the ordeal. On my first week appointment with him my JP drains on three of my sites had discharge low enough for a removal, and I was ordered to get milk of magnesia and if that does not work, magnesium citrate for the constipation, they seemed worried about that (Thankfully MoM got stuff flowing again). I wanted to try out ibphrophin, and that actually seems to be doing the job instead of my hydro's and tramadol. After just one week of recovery, I feel like I might actually be able to make it through a day at my desk IT job!\n\nI still feel like I am pulling my skin tight when I stand up straight, like I am wearing a bodysuit a size too small for me. But it'll stretch in time. Pain is there yes, but it's something I'm fighting through. And my compression binder is helping out. From what I understand, the scars themselves will be ugly and weak for up to six weeks, and the swelling and final body shape might take up to four-six moths to come together. But it made me cry. Finally, I am seeing a body of a person who I feel like was on the inside, and not some costume on the outside. There is a long way to go, and this does not mean I'm done, this journey is life long. But for now, it's a bit check in the win column.\n\nI'd love to answer questions people might have about this whole process! It's a side of the story that not all choose to take, but those that do don't seem to see much support for.\n\nPhotos: https://imgur.com/a/CBOk0",

But my surgeon actually injected pain medicine in my cuts that lasted for days that made me surprisingly comfortable.\n\nIt's still no cake walk. My pain for the first 3/4 days was in the 6-8 range all the time with peaks of 9. Only a few times can I say I hit a 10, and that was due to some movement or something on my part in the first 72 hours.",

They then reinserted the fat into my chest creating fat breasts but with no nipples bc those had cancer in the ducts. I couldn't move well for a while and had 3 drains when I came home. My surgery was 14.5 hours 5 days in hospital bc they transplanted abdominal skin to where my nipples had been and that can die if not carefully monitored. Anyway, there you are looking like me 3 years ago. God Bless you you will look great when this is over. May I ask how much you had to pay for this ? ",

I'm quite curious about feeling and sensation. Does it feel like you're touching a different part of your skin in some places? It occurred to that could be quite an odd thing to get used to seeing as though the nerves maybe be situated are in different places now. \n\nCongrats on everything though man!

Also, you pull off the bald-head look very well. It works for you.\n\nI do have a few questions about your weight loss, if you don't mind. First - what inspired you to go keto? Have you tried other diets before? And, if yes, what was different about keto for you? What made it stick? Second - did you do any fasting, intermittent or longer fasts? Third - did you start working out at some point? And, if yes, what did you do? And lastly - on mindset - If you could go back in time, what would you tell your self? What you know now that you wish you knew before you started losing weight? And what kept you motivated throughout those years?\n\nSorry, I know it's a lot of questions, but it's not every day that I see someone who had done what you've done, even here on reddit. And, if you have a long detailed post somewhere where you answer some of these things, please link it in.",

It's something I still struggle with.\n\n\nAnd finally, I'd go back and tell myself to chill it on the race once I got nearer to the end.

If refrigerator available: various cheeses, cucumber, smoked salmon, pre-mixed tuna salad. Eating out: omelets, eggs &amp; bacon, sashimi, Cobb and Caesar salad, tacos with extra cabbage (toss the tortillas), bunless/lettuce-wrapped burgers, &amp; steaks and veggies are all fairly ubiquitous dining out options. Hard liquor and soda/seltzer/diet soda, of course, for cocktail hour. Lots of keto travel options! \n\nKeep snacks with you so hunger doesn't derail your diet. Walk places as much as possible or stick with whatever travel exercise routine you prefer to cover any extra carbs you may consume.\n\nMost importantly, enjoy your travels and keto on!",

Maybe more than once. Sounds gross and you probably don't want to let anyone see you do it, but it's saved my keto ass more than once when the carb demon comes calling.",

I have the impression that this was a minor issue with older samplers.  It may have been alleviated with newer models.\n\nAs far as a I recall acetone alone would never put you over the limit, rather it could bump up your score and if you had been drinking, on some circumstances it could push you over the line.\n\nFailure of a breathalyser in a law enforcement scenario, if that is what you are concerned about would result in a second test at the station.  In the UK I believe that's blood which is what the law is formulated around Blood Alcohol Content (BAC).",

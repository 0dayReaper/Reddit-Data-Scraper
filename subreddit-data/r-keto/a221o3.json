    "postText": "Me and my girlfriend have been doing Keto together for the past 10 months and even though we occasionally stray we both keep each other honest and keep each other going. We had a friends wedding last night and its honestly the first time in a long time I absolutely love us in pictures and didn't mind her insisting we took \"selfies\".\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/WZdH6GW](https://imgur.com/a/WZdH6GW) \\- Love this gorgeous girl so much. Thank you Keto (and this sub) for changing our lives.\n\nEdit: you guys are amazing. Thank you so much for all the kind words this absolutely blew up. I've shown my gf a lot of the comments to because she's not on reddit. A few people have asked some questions I'll get around to answering sometime today. Thank you again everyone.. you are all so lovely.  \n\n\nSecond Edit:  \nEven though 99% of the replies have been super positive and supportive I thought I'd come address the ones that think this is fake or demanding a body shot. Look I never claimed that we are super skinny models now because we 100% aren't I'm still not happy with my body and I've got some more to lose, probably 10-15 kgs more I'm still reasonably big but no where near what I used to be. My gf still wants to lose weight as well so our journey continues. Yes the after picture is a great angle and it capturing all the right things, literally every single person that takes a picture of themselves does this, its still us... that's still what we look like... its not fake. Also people saying my hair colour changed need to find out what sun light is... so to address the \"show us your body\" and \"but the hair\" here is another recent selfie [https://imgur.com/a/8o6kex4](https://imgur.com/a/8o6kex4) I thought I'd do another comparison though just to show how far I've come with my body as well as my face. I'm not comfortable putting my gf's body and stuff on here because I haven't asked her and I just won't any way, but she looks great!",

I don't want to hear about your fancy keto meals like fathead pizza, I like hearing about the day to day regular stuff, like do you live on eggs and turkey lunchmeat rollups? Is one of you a fantastic cook and makes interesting meals every day or do you just cook up 2lbs of hamburger and broccoli and munch that for a few days? Do you use ketochow? Fasting?",

My kids noticed the wieght loss and i told them i was losing weight so i could go on the rides with them at disneyland. Now they watch out for me. I figure its what you do the 99% of the time that matters and just enjoy yourself as normal the other 1% of the time. You guys look amazing congratulations.",

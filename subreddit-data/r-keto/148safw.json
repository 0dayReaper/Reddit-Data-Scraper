I will probably need to have a small memorial service to let them go. Do they have to go away completely?\nMost common (I keep these in my fridge pretty constantly and snack on them. I don't add sugar or anything like that):\nRaspberries \nBlueberries\nBackberries \n\nFairly common but only when they are in season and not the cost of a midsized sedan:\nCherries\n\n\nReasonably common when they are first in season and not fully ripe (I like the crunchy! But I also think that probably makes them a little nicer to blood sugar):\nPeaches\n\nNot sure what these are considered for keto purposes but please don't take them away from me!:\ntomatoes\ncucumber \n\nHow bad is it? Do they all have to go? can I use sparingly? what does sparingly actually mean?!",

I personally like crunchy tart fruit so fruit that is slightly less than ripe is good for me. I have also noticed that for me, personally, it does not seem to lead to the same feelings that things like very ripe fruit and juice give me. That led to me doing some research and discovering that it is widely believed that eating fruit when it is slightly less ripe will have less of an impact on blood sugar (for the average person. I do not know your situation, nor do I know the specifics of the studies I read. It was purely personal research at the time). I don't eat a lot of bananas so I have no personal information about their ripe/unripe situation. I just know that personally eating fruit the way I naturally prefer it has always been a benefit for myself and my health. You will, of course, need to do whatever is best for your own personal circumstances.",

Eat what you like, but don\u2019t believe it\u2019s better for you because you\u2019re getting less sugar, when ketogenic diets focus on minimizing all carbs, not just sugar. One could consume 20g of sugar and still be within the bounds of what makes a ketogenic diet for most people. If you have a higher carb budget to maintain ketosis, like I have done, you could consume that amount as sugar and still be in ketosis. \n\nA medium peach has 12g of carbs.",

Berries tend to be better so long as they're not sweetened with sugar. Tomatoes are okay in moderation, and cucumber is pretty keto-friendly.\n\nIn general, it's useful to look up nutrition info and get an idea of how much of your carb budget something will take up, even if you're not meticulously tracking. For example, a regular-sized tomato or a cup of cherry tomatoes has 4-5 carbs, so if you're cutting up a few cherry tomatoes to eat in a salad or eating a slice on a burger, you're probably only getting a couple carbs from that, but something like spaghetti sauce will give you a lot more.",

I couldn\u2019t imagine not having cake or cookies and watermelon daily, in season or not.\n\nI went cold-turkey on sugar, and while the first bit was miserable, when I did start to reintroduce fruit, blueberries and strawberries were amazing!!\n\nI think also fructose metabolizes differently in the liver than straight sucrose, but the fiber helps- so whole fruit is better for you than juices. \n\nGrapes. I love grapes, but they are so high in sugar and 5-6 of them to fit in a carb limit is just sad to me. So I only eat them if I don\u2019t care about my carb count that day. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nFruit isn\u2019t verboten, it\u2019s just really high in carbs so hard to fit a ton of them daily. If you are constantly snacking though the day on fruit, that may be a habit you need to change because the carbs add up quickly. Instead of constant snacking, portion the fruit so you know how much fits into your macros that day. It\u2019s tough to get in veggies and fruit both but can be done if you plan.",

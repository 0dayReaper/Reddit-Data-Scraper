    "postText": "I realized after doing a ton of research that I\u2019m lacking salt. I\u2019m now looking for a high quality salt. I\u2019m torn between Pink Himalayan salt, Redmonds Real Salt, and basic Sea Salt.\n\nSea salt worries me because of micro plastics, and both Pink salt and Real salt concern me when it comes to heavy metals.\n\nI asked Redmonds if their salt contains lead and other heavy metals, and this is the response I got.\n\n\u201cThe heavy metals that are found in our salt are not added metals. So they are naturally occurring in our salt. This means that it is compounded with other minerals as well and will not stay in your system. They will pass through your system and your body will get rid of it.\u201d\n\nIs there any truth to this? Do I need to worry? My intake of salt is about to go up a good bit as I\u2019m an athlete and I\u2019m definitely lacking, so I don\u2019t want to put anything in my body that can cause a health scare and accumulate heavy metals in my body.\n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019m using Diamond Crystal salt. Is this good enough? I\u2019m guessing any minerals it is lacking I will pick up in my diet.",

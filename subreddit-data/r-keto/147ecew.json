    "postText": "Im still a newbie at this, I started on May 25. My starting weight was 272, Im also a 6'2 male. By week one I dropped to 264, in ten days I dropped to 260 and then had a party night and woke up at 265. at the end of this week im at 258. I know alot of that is water weight but it is still pretty cool to see, and I have had compliments about how Im looking better from people that dont know im doing this. Another neat thing is my blood pressure has dropped to great levels. At week one I was sitting at 135/85 and staying constant. Then 12 days later it has dropped to 118/74 and has stayed there every time I check it ( same time every morning same as my weight check) . My appetite is none existent anymore, I buy what I use to eat in a day or two and stretch it a whole week and feel good, saving money as well! but I really am not starving. Im also doing some IF during the work week eating in between 10am-1pm and bone broth when I get home + some pickle juice. Its exciting times my energy is up, I can confidently turn down carbs and not be peer pressured into them and im very excited for the future! ",

A diversion from Keto for one meal does not mean it is ok to go off for a whole day (or weekend, week, month).",

Decided on doing meal prep for the week so I do not have to worry about what I'm going to cook and used Google sheets to graph my weight and blood pressure. Now I find it fun to see how different things affect my weight loss. Not enough sleep ....not much in weight loss, if I drink....everything haults for a day or two. Hard day at work.....lots of weight loss. It's fun tracking it",

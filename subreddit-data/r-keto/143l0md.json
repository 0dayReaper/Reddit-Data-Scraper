    "postText": "I was wondering if exceeding protein requirements could be problematic for keto? I\u2019m brand new to this. I weight 160lbs, and have been eating 200g of protein for a long time now. It\u2019s roughly 25% of my caloric intake, so I\u2019d assume it\u2019s ok? I know it\u2019s beyond what\u2019s necessary by most standards, I just really like meat and cheese.",

                            "comment": "In some forms of Keto (there are a few forms), we use MUCH less protein. For example 0.5 g per pound of adjusted body weight. So if my ideal weight is 160 and I currently weigh 185, my adjusted body weight is 168 pounds and I would consume about 84g of protein. With 20-30g of carbs, the rest is all fat. The objective with this form of keto is not primarily to build muscle, but to maintain what you have while losing fat and deriving therapeutic benefits of ketosis above and beyond weight loss. The higher levels of ketones generated come from both body fat and dietary fat. Ketones themselves have an effect of suppressing appetite a bit. The other benefit of keto is that it regulates your blood sugar, insulin, and ghrelin so that you have a more regular appetite and avoid ravenous episodes. This works very well once you get over the carb/sugar addictions most of us had (might take a couple of weeks). Good luck.",

It\u2019s what had me questioning my intake, since obviously it\u2019s much higher than what I assume is standard. I\u2019m not gonna complain if I eat less and lose a few pounds, but it\u2019s not the intention.",

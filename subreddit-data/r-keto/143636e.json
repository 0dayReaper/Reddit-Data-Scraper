    "postText": "Been on keto for almost 2 and a half months now. Starting weight is 305 CW is probably around 265. 5\u201910 M\n\nI\u2019m just worried I\u2019m maybe not eating enough? I usually fast for 72 during the week then OMAD the rest. So I started off limiting my calories to 1200, then I found myself getting full around 1000. Now I can barely eat all my food when I make around 800 calories worth.\n \n I\u2019m just wondering is this too strict? I\u2019ve been reading stuff saying if you don\u2019t eat enough it\u2019s bad..but I\u2019m literally not hungry. I\u2019ve had a couple cheat days as well but even then I find myself getting so full easily. Is this a bad sign?",

The whole idea of keto is to allow your body to access and burn the stored fat you have, and that's what you seem to be utilizing for fuel.  \n\nGet your protein and Keep calm and keto on.",

Your appetite will eventually rear its ugly head again and it'll be tougher later on to get it back under control.\n\nBump your calories up to 1,600-1,700 per day and sustain that.\n\nHopefully you'll avoid the issue I'm having.",

            "comment": "Even though you are eating 800 calories, your body will burn 2,000 calories (if that is the amount your body needs). Keto give you access to the fat stored on your body. This is why your metabolism do not slow down during ketosis. Monitor how you are doing: Perhaps keep a notebook on it.\n\nYou are in your second month and fat adapted. Hopefully, you won't have a serious cheat to ruin things. That is one of the benefits of keto, it will access fat on your body. You should still eat some fat. But if you are feeling great at 800 calories, you are doing great. My only caution is to get nutrients. Some nutrients do not carry to the next day. Another benefit is testosterone increases for men when fasting. But do eat more keto foods on the days you feel it is needed. No seed oil, stay hydrated and salty. KCKO",

No matter how little I ate, i have remained at 185. \n\nOne thing to note is, now that i have little carbs in my blood, i notice a very distinct difference in my workout intensity if i don't have some carbs that day. However other than that, I feel great.",

Another thank-you to my two running buddies (pictured)\n\nI wanted to share some of my favorite foods with y'all (because Keto is all about the delicious food, right?) \n\n**My favorite recipes - Entrees**\n\n- [Meatsa](Http://www.cavemanketo.com/meatza) - I change the \"crust\" recipe by adding 1/4 to 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan to the meat.  Also .. Pro tip for making the crust flat is to put the meat in a pan, cover it in plastic wrap so you can smoosh it all over evenly.\n- [Cheesy Ranch Chicken](http://www.ourtableforseven.com/2013/02/cheesy-ranch-chicken.html) - very quick and easy to make. Extra-delicious if you use Trader Joe's bacon cheese\n- [Slow Cooker Whole Chicken](http://eezyrecipes.com/crock-pot-chicken-okay-yall-this-was-the-best-chicken-that-i-have-ever-made-it-was-so-moist-and-delicious-best-part-easy/)\n\n\n**My favorite recipes - Sides**\n\n- [Broccoli Cheddar Soup](http://kellythekitchenkop.com/low-carb-broccoli-cheese-soup)- I steam frozen broccoli because I'm lazy\n- Mashed cauliflower\n\n\n**My favorite recipes - Beverages**\n\nI make a famous \"Keto cappuccino\" and a \"Keto Chai Latte\". I'll have to post those some other time :)\n",

I'm pretty sure most of the female minis I met were more around 17-20 pounds, your girl sure is lanky! She looks so tall! Biggest in her litter sure makes sense. :) So much the better for a fast running buddy!",

I bet yours keep you on your toes too, eh? I wish you the best for the uppity teenager/\"terrible twos\" phase with the young'un! (Assuming the pibble is already over being a stubborn teen by now.)",

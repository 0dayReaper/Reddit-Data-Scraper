    "postText": "I\u2019m a male, 5\u2019 9\u201d, weigh around 180 lbs, and am trying to lose about 20 pounds and as much body fat as possible while trying to at least maintain if not gain muscle. I\u2019m active and workout Monday through Friday, and I\u2019m using an app to log food. With regard to macros and calories, my daily allotments are the following:\n\nCalories: less than 1,776\nFat: 70% - 80% of calories\nCarbs: 8% or less of calories (less than 30 NET grams of carbs)\nProtein: 18% - 22% of calories (95-125 grams)\n\nBased on these metrics, is this an effective way to lose weight and fat while maintaining if not GAINING muscle? (Probably not relevant, but I am allergic to dairy, egg YOLKS [eggwhites are fine], and pork).\n\nAny advice, suggestions, and opinions are welcome. Thank you.\nEdit: I\u2019m 37 years old",

It sounds like you\u2019re a little confused about how to measure your macros.\n\nPercentages and macronutrient ratios are **only** relevant if you are doing Keto to manage an epileptic disorder.

Carbs under 30, all from veg sources.\n\nI absolutely did not gain muscle during any of these cuts, but I've never been able to gain appreciable muscle mass in a deficit. Under any circumstance, even while using PEDs. Your experience may vary, especially if you're new to training, I've heard this is anecdotally possible, but it's never been true for me. Strength is another story. Lots of people can gain strength with proper overload during a cut.\n\nI've lost fat quite rapidly while doing this.",

Also not sure why types of workouts you do but if it\u2019s resistance training and weight lifting that will suffice. As for retaining muscle too I\u2019d say you wanna cut a slow as possible, personally I think 1800 calories might be a bit too low. If you\u2019re decently active your TDEE at your stats should be like at least 2700-2800. So I\u2019d say start around 2300-2400 calories a day and see how that trends for a few weeks then if needed slowly lower from there. Too many people drastically reduce calories lower than they need to right off the bat",

I\u2019m not that overweight, but am trying to lose some body fat before hitting gym hard and gaining muscle (stats 5\u201910, 81kg, walk b/w 12-15k steps and gym 5-6 days a week).\n\nNow what\u2019s confusing me is how much I should be eating. I\u2019ve used the keto calculator that\u2019s been referenced over and over again on this subreddit. Inputted my details and it\u2019s recommended I eat under 1700 kcals for a 20% deficit. I\u2019ve also read that you should be eating around 2g/kg of lean body mass of protein which would equal (my bf is approx 25%) 120g. There\u2019s a comment above of this 5\u20195 sedentary woman who\u2019s eating 160g! Am I eating too little (protein and overall)?",

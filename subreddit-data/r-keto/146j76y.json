Anxiety decreases dramatically, and I generally just feel well.\n\nHave we figured out what's the reason behind this? Does it have to do with ketones affecting the brain? Insulin sensitivity?",

In a nutshell, malnourishment and eating too much trash from the standard American diet causes mitochondria dysfunction.  If the cells can not deliver energy, organs will not have the needed nutrients and our brain is just another organ that needs healthy nutrients from a healthy diet.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JVl1X0fb1uA\n\n\nSo mental illnesses, from brain fog, to clarity, to not be overly stressed out over menial things in life, to all kinds of issues was caused by a terrible diet and all said issues will naturally go away with the right diet.\n\nHe and most researchers also explains having a trash diet leads to the disruption of your gut biome which leads to depression and other kinds of mental illnesses.  Our gut is our second brain.  This is heavily studied and has proven there is a neuro link between the gut and the brain.\n\nIt is very interesting and compelling.  What you are experiencing, from merely changing your diet and affect your mental capacity is already a good proof Dr. Christopher Palmer is on the right path. \n\nHope that answers your questions",

    "postText": "Hi all, I posted a few weeks ago asking if anyone had any experience with keto and benzo withdrawal (was prescribed a high dose and then left on it for about 18 months despite trying to get help reducing). Have flagged this nsfw because drugs I guess? \n\nWell, I\u2019m now nearly 4 weeks into keto and wanted to report the findings of my n=1 experiment. \n\nFirstly, keto has greatly improved how I feel when I reduce my benzo dose. Rather than feeling terrible for 5-6 days after a reduction, I just feel a bit \u2018off\u2019 for 3-4 days. This was the main thing I wanted to try keto for, with the thinking that it seems keto can increase GABA production in the gut, and benzo use makes GABA receptors \u2018lazy\u2019. So far so good with the reductions! Only 3 more months to go\u2026\n\nGenerally speaking my mood is a bit more level, but not massively improved. However I have an \u2018interesting\u2019 psychiatric history so definitely didn\u2019t expect it to fix all my problems!!!\n\nI\u2019ve lost weight, roughly 14lbs/6.5kg. I thought this might happen but it\u2019s not really a goal for me as I felt \u2018ok ish\u2019 where I was. I know a lot of this is water weight. BUT I am now back where I was before taking an antipsychotic regularly last year. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll monitor and probably up the fat, this wasn\u2019t really my goal for keto. \n\nDidn\u2019t experience keto flu, but was very mindful of electrolytes from the start. \n\nMy rock climbing has improved, I seem to have more stamina and power but this may also be because of weight loss so better power/weight ratio? Haven\u2019t been training like a demon so I\u2019m assuming this is what it is. But fuelling big climbing days feels a lot easier, and the further I get towards keto adaptation, the easier it is to top up the energy levels with cheese or macadamias if I\u2019m feeling fancy! \n\nWay less brain fog, actually starting to be able to work again. Only odd days but that\u2019s a massive improvement. \n\nCost wise, I\u2019m surprised that I\u2019m saving money, so that\u2019s awesome. \n\nSo yeah, so far so dreamy! Caveat of sample size of 1\u2026would recommend giving keto a go if you\u2019re trying to withdraw from benzos. My GP also knows and approves (in a \u2018if it\u2019s working for you, then that\u2019s fine\u2019 kind of way) which is cool\u2026although I think he knows that I\u2019d probably just do it anyway.",

Felt amazing by the end of it. Exercise really helped me with the psychological aspect, which is 70% of the battle. Good luck, mate!",

I am extremely well aware of the links between epilepsy and the keto diet. I don't need a lesson. I have a disease called gluten ataxia (and also gluten psychosis). It can cause bipolar, schizophrenia and, yes, also epilepsy... And it is uncommon, but it is *my personal experience* that it helps with seizures, so I offered it to you. \n\nYour response was garbage. I'm not trying to fix you. I'm just offering a piece of information.\n\nAnd believe me, I've been just as (if not way more) fucking ill, and on the brink of death several times, but I'd still NEVER turn down a lead on getting better, even if it was silly advice (mine absolutely isn't). I would (and do) throw the kitchen sink at my health problems. So I wasn't pushing anything on you, and definitely wasn't offering advice I wouldn't be more than willing to receive.\n\n What is *actually* infantilizing is your assumption that I'm healthy and I \"just don't get it\". I was suicidally depressed for a decade, suffered paranoia, have had seizures, have had muscle wasting, neurodegeneration, chronic joint inflammation, I've had blood coming out both ends of my digestive system, insane rashes that don't go away, eczema, severe ataxia (no sense of balance), and have almost died from malabsorption. I have MCAS, severe asthma, extreme food allergies... Severe fatigue.... All of it. I'm chronic disease walking. The idea that I don't understand your plight is fucking laughable. You couldn't walk a day in my shoes.\n\nYou trying to \"teach\" me anything is worthless. I know all about chronic illness I'm just not a bitter jerk about it.\n\nSorry I mentioned anything... Continue wallowing and being as self-righteous as possible.",

That's not going to fly here. \"Microaggressions\" don't exist, especially since I've experienced seizures. How am I meant to be aggressive towards someone for something I have also experienced? But, if you were looking for actual aggression, and you wanted to be psychologically abusive towards someone so you could elicit it, you got what you wanted. Here, I won't be accidentally subtly aggressive towards you. That's not my style. I prefer to be direct.\n\nAnd the severity of my illness has a great deal of bearing on this matter because you spoke to me as though I was stupid and I'd never had anyone make a suggestion about managing my health. That you have seizures isn't some special category of illness that warrants its own special treatment. It makes no difference. People making suggestions about others' illness is a universal experience, and it isn't specific to you. And you're not a victim for it, either. You aren't a victim. \n\nYou're not specially or specifically disadvantaged in a way others aren't and I'm not going to walk on eggshells around you while you act like a crybully. At least people pretty much universally empathize with your condition. When I tell people I can't eat gluten, they flat out fucking ignore me. I've had people intentionally gluten me because they don't \"believe in all of that junk\". And I get to throw up blood for five days and have blisters all over my body, and feel suicidal for several months after.\n\nDon't talk to me about people being aggressive to you about your condition-- until you get people flippantly making fun of your condition (as in: not pretending to have a seizure for effect, but actually mocking and gaslighting you, and calling you a liar) and intentionally poisoning you, I don't care about your feelings on that front.",

My sleep is also way better which really helps with anxiety. \n\n I think weirdly although chemically clonazepam has a long half life, it\u2019s actual physical effects last shorter than diazepam. Following the [Ashton manual](https://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/), I transitioned over to the equivalent diazepam dose which stays in your system for longer, so makes for smoother withdrawal. It\u2019s also a lot easier to reduce in small increments. Trying to half then quarter those tablets is really hard to get a consistent dose.",

Folks are reporting that their addictive and compulsive behaviors have diminished or disappeared? I wonder if the drug has a similar effect to ketosis, in that it eases the need to get that \"bump\" of drugs or hair pulling give a sufferer?\n\nI would not want to take the drug for weight loss or T2D control, since I've already done that via keto, but I also have a compulsive behavior issue (picking at my skin). I may consider the use of the med for that. I've been trying to control that all of my life, and the thought of relief from that need makes me hopeful.\n\nIf you already use semiglutide or another GLP-1 antagonist, have you noticed this effect? I think some of the researchers mentioned in the article might want to hear from you.\n\nI do not have a financial interest in these meds.",

She's microtapering right now and it's really hard for her. She isn't doing keto, but has left many other foods and is kinda in a \"keto light\" so to speak (I know it isn't a thing). According to her research on the subject, she shouldn't eat dairy or many processed meats, so I was wondering if you did the same and what do you eat then? (I know I eat a lot of cheese under keto).\n\nAny help would be appreciate. Benzo withdrawal is hell.",

Never felt better too. \n\nI /think/ the main benefits for me have come through simply being in ketosis, rather than what I eat in particular? \n\nWhich variety of benzo is she tapering off out of interest? \n\nFeel free to DM btw",

Benzos should have a black box warning put on them and patients should need to sign a waiver. I NEVER would have agreed to take one if I had known what I was getting into.",

            "comment": "Back in my bodybuilding and powerlifting days I was badly addicted to benzos for a while. As in, I was getting it extra-legally and taking ungodly doses.\n\nI don't want to scare you, but the issue for me was seizures from withdrawal, maybe this might be interesting to you since keto since is known to help with epilepsy that doesn't respond to other medications.\n\nAs I said, I don't want to scare you, I doubt you'll get seizures if you've been taking the recommended doses. But since I was so heavily addicted to benzos, I would get seizures if I came off it for a couple of days due to the rebound GABA suppression. At first it was a heavy xanax addiction, 20 to 30 bars per day. The seizures obviously scared the shit out of me, and it's what made me get help. I went to a rehab that doubled as a psych hospital with professional medical staff and managed to come off it under constant medical supervision. \n\nI relapsed during the lockdowns (because who would have thought, locking someone in their house will make their anxiety disorder way worse). During that time I was also in complete keto and it was working great for fat loss. The benzos I was buying during that time were stronger than xanax even, they were pills that had a mix of designer benzos, and I was having long benders on huge amounts of these pills. \n\nSomewhat surprisingly in my relapse period, I only had one minor seizure even though the benzos were far stronger than xanax. That might be because of being in keto, I'm not sure.\n\nEither way, all the best with benzo withdrawal, it's an extremely rough road and you're not alone in what you're going through, and it seems like you're doing great so far!",

Good on you for keeping at it.\n\n Honestly I think I was starting to get seizures on the original reduction protocol I got put on. It was one of the things that made me do a bit more research on how I should be withdrawing, and then coming across keto as a possibility to make it a little easier.",

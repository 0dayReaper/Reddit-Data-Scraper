    "postText": "Hello, sw:95kg cw:90kg h:167cm age:21\nIve been on keto most of the days in 4 weeks, some days i ate a little more carbs but still in caloric deficit. I lost 5kg by eating in a calorie deficit, eating keto and fasting 20:4 and currently im doing omad. I feel very good i slowly moved from 16:8 to omad and now I'm used to it. I can tell you that i have more mental clarity in the mornig and also my skin cleared up. Last few days i ve been fasting for more than 24 hrs but nothing extreme. I eat keto bcs it makes me stay full longer but also i allow myself to have carbs sometimes bcs if i go strict keto i always get keto rash(one of unlucky ones). When i eat carbs its around 40 grams with fiber. Very proud of myself, 5kg is not much and not that noticable but im so motivated to continue this!!",

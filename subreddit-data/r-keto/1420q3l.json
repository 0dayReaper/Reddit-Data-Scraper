Unfortunately some medications have adverse effects of lowering TDEE and it becomes easier to gain, so you could try keto in the hopes it helps you eat less or you can just eat less of whatever you\u2019re eating now",

            "comment": "Spironolactone should not be affecting weight in any direction (apart from diuretic effect).\n\nOne thing to watch when combining keto and / or fasting with spironolactone is potassium levels. Spironolactone is potassium sparing but flushes away other electrolytes very efficiently. So, you need to adjust all standard electrolyte supplementation regimes and recipes to take that into account, or you can easily end up in heart issues, even in a failure.\n\nIt is a situation where you need to really seek medical advice for your specific situation as to how to adjust intake, ideally with blood test control until you find your sweet spot.",

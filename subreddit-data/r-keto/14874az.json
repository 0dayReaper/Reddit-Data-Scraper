    "postText": "  Hello! I'm on day three of Keto for the first time ever.  I'm 41f, 5'11\" and weigh 299lbs. I'm using the Carb Manager tracker and mostly utilizing recipes and ideas from there until I get comfortable.  After inputting my data and setting my target carbs to 20g (based on the recommendation in the intro here) my macros came to 101g protein,  154g fat,  1868 calories. My primary goal is weight loss.  Do these seem like appropriate numbers? I don't want to get started on the wrong foot. (AND, I really wasn't sure what to input for daily calories deficit,  so it's at -26%, if that makes sense?) \n    Thanks for taking the time!",

            "comment": "When I put your stats into the keto calculator into the sidebar and hold carbs to 20g and a 26% deficit I get this:\n\nCal: 1723\nProtein: 110g\nFat: 134g\nCarb: 20g\n\nFor a loss of approx 1.21 lbs/wk\n\nHealthy weight loss is 1-2lbs per week or no more than 1% of your body weight. You can reasonably do 2-3lbs at your current weight and still be okay for a while. However, I think I wouldn\u2019t go into a super steep deficit until you get more used to this way of eating. \n\nAssuming your insulin resistance is high due to your current high weight, I would say it\u2019s okay to keep the fat dialed up fairly high to help you get control of your insulin levels. Once you are well into fat adaptation (can be anywhere from 8-12 weeks) then you can lower the fat grams and increase protein. \n\nRecalculate macros after every 10-20lbs of loss. Smaller bodies need fewer calories. \n\nPrioritize protein by planning your meals around your protein choice first, then fill in fat if needed. Protein is the goal, keep carbs as low as possible, fat is a lever for satiety so don\u2019t feel like you have to eat a tablespoon of butter to \u201cmeet\u201d your fat goal. Eat when hungry, stop when full, read the FAQ in the sidebar. \n\nYou got this!",

I also realized after posting that my stated deficit was off because that was what I ended the day with according to the app,  rather than my initial calculation. My overall deficit is closer to -20%. It helps to know the healthy parameters of loss weekly,  as well as when to recalculate.  So far I'm finding I don't feel like I need to utilize all the fat macros... but it's only beginning of day four so we'll see.",

            "comment": "Keto can be a big lifestyle adjustment especially if you live and eat with others.  You have to relearn much of what you do out of habit and cravings.\n\nFor many people that are either confused or overwhelmed it's easier to ease into it learning along the way.\n\nFor example, this is how I started:\n\n**Week 1** \\- Start tracking what you eat - Just eat as much as you want as often as you want.  Prioritize protein and minimize carbs below 20g. Use fats for satiety. Don't worry about a calorie deficit. You should still start to lose some water weight. \n\n**Week 2** \\- Review last weeks data and look for insights - Start eating to macro goals\n\n**Week 3** \\- Review last weeks data and look for insights - Calculate BMR and start eating to calorie deficit\n\n**Week 4** \\- Start growing your recipe book and pantry staples - you must be getting bored of the same foods\n\n**Week 5** \\- Add exercise and track it- even adding a 10 minute 3x walk is helpful. \n\n**Week 6** \\- You've lost weight by now so recalculate your calorie and macro goals.\n\nYou got this!\n\nEDIT:  Typos, formatting and added up to week 6",

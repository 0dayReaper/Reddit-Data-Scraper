This week I'm doing quite well, so far I've;\n- Made almond bread,\n- Roasted &amp; salted macadamia nuts,\n- Butter roasted pecans\n\nAnd now I'm trying a keto ketchup recepie, hopefully it doesn't take much longer for this bread to cool off as I'm gasping for some cheese on toast to try this ketchup with!",

You do see then sneaking things in there like aspartame and or sucralose where I'm personally using a stevia/ erythitol blend with my own added spices (I'm not using onion/onion powder to keep the carbs lower)\n\nChicken thighs are always good, im just waiting for some new vac seal bags to turn up so I can sort my lunches out for the week, however my ketchup is done so time to make me a slice of cheese on toast to dip it into \ud83e\udd29",

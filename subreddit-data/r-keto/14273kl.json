I've found some shredded salads, (sauceless) grilled meats, but I feel like I'm missing out on most of the food.\n\nHow do you manage?",

They r usually hard boiled after 15mins.",

I manage by realizing that how I feel by eating that dessert or bread or bowl of pasta is not worth breaking the diet I've worked so hard for.  I try to remember how I felt and looked before I went on keto and I don't want to go back to that. That's what motivates me personally.  \n\nBut I do think people put too much pressure on themselves.  It's okay if you want cheat days while on vacation. If you're doing keto to lose weight, then just eat in moderation.  Instead of an entire bowl of rice, eat half of that.  Life is too short to not enjoy a delicious treat on occasion.  Then when you go back home, start up keto again.  As long as you have the discipline to continue after your vacation, I don't think cheat days matter.",

They are not gonna miss out on some of the best food just to stay on keto on vacation. \n\nThat being said, make a plan, understand your carb tolerance and track your weight so you have an idea about how much off the wagon you can fall.

I might weigh 10lb more when I get back, but 7lb of that is most likely water, and a nice 24+ hour fast plus a strict day or two (&lt;10g carbs) once I get back should knock that right back off.",

Now I actually enjoy keto lifestyle on vacations too because I chase the best steak or Mexican food or famous burger place where ever I go. It's like any other food experience when I vacation I find what fresh meats or seafood I can get to enjoy where ever I am! I also try to plan and indulge in something carby if the place is known for it towards the end of the vacation... the only reason being I want my ketosis energy while exploring a new place... I double down on high fat and it ends up making vacations so much fun because I never need breaks! It's always go go go... I've redirected my brain and it has taken a bit of time. Think about what you want to enjoy on a vacation and plan accordingly. Don't plan it around being keto necessarily- think about what to do, what will require energy, what days can you eat some carbs and enjoy a slower day. I find it works for me to just enjoy planning how to make the best of my vacation more than anything else! And it has taken a few tries to perfect and now I look forward to planning my vacation because I've embraced this lifestyle",

Noodles and rice are everywhere and usually a component of cuisines the world over.  That being said I find Asian food the most challenging to eat keto style.  Probably because I\u2019m not so familiar with all the ingredients.  I make it work though. Best of luck.",

If you want to eat something that you consider a real treat, eat it and then carry on with low carb options as much as you\u2019re able. \n\nAvoid overeating the high carb foods you treat yourself to; there is no sense in eating like you\u2019re never going to get another chance to eat rice or cake again. If you have the opportunity to eat something truly special, then just enjoy it. The trade off is that you\u2019re going to have to fast or whatever it takes to get yourself quickly into keto again. The food you want to eat is either worth the trouble or it\u2019s not. \n\nAs for myself, I\u2019ve come to the realization that I\u2019m going to eat low carb for the rest of my life or else I\u2019ll end up adding another layer of jiggling fat to my belly and I\u2019ll suffer the pain that excess sugar does to my body. It\u2019s as simple as that. I know that no food is truly off limits if it\u2019s something I will really enjoy, but I have to weigh the consequences before I take a bite. I can\u2019t look at it as a special occasion every time I eat in a restaurant or look for reasons to make exceptions to my lifestyle too often or I\u2019ll go right back to where I was before keto.",

Return to keto when you get back. \n\nIf it's for epilepsy or whatever, then just go carnivore if you need to. Every country I've been to has an equivalent to steak and salad.\nMight be roasted pangolin , but hey, it'll work.\nSouth East asia was tricky ish to do keto, but I just got 5 fried eggs for brunch everyday, and ordered meat in the night. Simple enough.\n\nLast and best choice... Its a holiday, it's a n event that'll last a short time. Splurge, enjoy, return to keto after.",

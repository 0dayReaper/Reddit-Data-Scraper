            "comment": "Just a little background:  The first picture was taken just before I started Keto in August of 2014.  I have PCOS and I was at my highest weight, just over 300lbs.  I didn't ever see that on the scale myself, but it did register at a doctor's office around that time.  \nI started Keto 8/15/14, after years of failed IVF treatments and nearly 10 years of infertility.  \n\nKeto immediately changed how I looked and felt.  It was and still is unlike anything I've ever tried.  And I feel like I've tried it all.  After 6 months of lazy keto I became pregnant naturally, but suffered an early miscarriage.  It took a hit on my weight loss but after a few weeks of mourning I got back on it.  \n\nWeight loss was rocky after that point but I tried to be as dedicated as possible, because regardless of the scale I just feel so much better on Keto.\nAbout 7 months later I became pregnant again.  But this time it was a cornual ectopic, which proved dangerous and scary.  It was devastating but my husband and I got back into Keto fully after the holidays.  \n\nSo I basically lost 40lbs in a year and maintained it for another year.  I lurked and debated starting Keto for a year before actually diving in and doing it.  If you're in the same position and wondering if you should do it, I am begging you to give it a try.  After seeing how well it has treated me 6 family members have started it and are all in the best health of their lives.  I am so grateful to this sub for all of the anecdotes, advice and information.  \n\nEdit:  I don't post only Keto things, but if you're on Instagram my username is carisagilman.",

                                    "comment": "Who diagnosed you with PCOS? I mean, what sort of doctor? I ask because, after telling my mother about Keto, she said something along the lines of \"LCHF is exactly what the endo who diagnosed you with PCOS reccomended, but you refused to try it.\" and that was 14 years ago. Sadly, I was 14 and crazy and picky and only wanted to eat potatoes and bread, so I didn't take the advice until much later (clearly, as I had completely forgotten it). However, I was diagnosed by a reproductive endocrinologist because I was so young and my amenorrhea was so bad, and I'm assuming that's probably out of the norm. I have to assume she had more experience with PCOS than a non-women's-health specialist would, but even so, it just baffles me as the solution has clearly been around for at least half my life but it took me years of struggling and  blaming myself, as well as a metric ton of research to figure it out.  Edit: You look amazing, and I'm insanely jealous of your eyebrows.",

She hasn't gone to the doctor for her pregnancy issues (she knows she should) and she assumes it's most likely her weight. \n\nShe has tried keto before and it worked great but she fell off of it after a few months each time. Her husband has made many attempts to eat healthy/ exercise with her but she goes into her bad habits when she is alone. With all her failed attempts over the past 2 years she has lost hope and in result has become lazy/depressed and buries herself in video games (WoW) which is causing her husband to lose hope. \n\nIt kills me inside to see her this way because I love her so much but, it is something she to realize and do herself. When that day comes I'll be there to cheer her on and help in any way I can. Success stories like yours gives me hope and I also like to show her these to let her know that she isn't alone and maybe inspire her. I just wish she would Reddit because I feel the supportive and positive attitude from r/keto would really help. Regardless thank you for sharing this! You are truly an inspiration and you can see that by how you have made a difference in your family's lives. Thank you.",

In so many ways I'm sure she feels like she has so far to go it's not worth starting.  \nI know that the truth is that she wouldn't want to be pregnant at that weight, putting herself and her baby at risk.  But I always blocked that thought out while I was trying, because doctors had told me \"women bigger than you get pregnant every single day\".\n\nI used to live my life in this strange circular pattern, of shame and eating to punish myself for eating too much.  And then there were years where I spent time trying to force diets on my body that just didn't work.  \nI have a couple of YouTube channels where I discuss all of this, including my fertility problems and weight issues.  (Under the same as my username.)  I am by no means assuming I can help or change her mind.  But I put my most private struggles into the world in hopes they can help other women in my position.\n\nI know your sister doesn't use Reddit, but I would be willing to talk to her at any point and help her if she needs it.  Or just encourage her along the way.  I wish you both the best and thank you for your kind words.\n",

And I wish I hadn't been dumb enough to believe it.  Even though I have PCOS, it seems I am more affected by the side effects than actual cystic ovaries.  So I have weight gain, hirsutism, skin tags, etc. and never had the \"string of pearls\" that most women have during ultrasounds.  So with that fact combined with a doctor basically encouraging me to stay fat, it was a dangerous combination.  Congratulations on your babies!  I am hoping a family is in my future, but if it is not I at least know that health will be.  ",

There's no logical way to explain human behavior it seems.\n\n My take is that it's the most familiar way of coping that we tend to fall back into, fo self soothing-dopamine fix, etc... then feeling worthless and shame contributes. Ends up in a viscious cycle..feel bad, eat more junk, realize (on some level) how stupid that is, feel worse due to feeling stupid engaging in self sabotage, feel incapable ,feel as if one doesn't deserve to feel or get any better than that, punishing oneself by reinforcing that one is unable to do the right thing,etc.  Various scenarios which defy logic, but who's saying humans act on logic , right?",

People who turn to food for emotional support tend to use it for a range of emotion.  So you can eat badly in a celebratory way but also find strange comfort in it when things are bad.  \nIn my case there were times when I had found out my pregnancy was not viable, and I had to wait 4-6 weeks for it to resolve itself.  When the only thing that will help a problem is time, often the only thing that can comfort you in those long hours is food.  At least, if you are an emotional eater.  But knowing that the food you're eating (or even just the quantity of it) is detrimental, it still happens anyway.  And it happens in a sort of odd punishment/comfort cycle where I know that the food has caused the problems, but if I'm hurting, what else is there?\n\nThe answer is that there is so much more.  There is life, the world, and the people you love.  But pain and depression can be such solitary issues, and rather than burden others with it I would eat.  \n\nBut in addition to that, sometimes I found myself eating things I didn't even want just to comfort others.  Upon knowing that I had a failed IVF cycle or a miscarriage, people don't know how to treat you.  So they feed you.  Including my husband, who sees my struggle from the inside.  Loved ones don't know what to say or do, so \"let's go out for ice cream!\" or \"I baked you some cookies!\" or \"Come over and visit, I've ordered a pizza!\".  And in a way I knew that if I refused that food I was refusing the only comfort that they knew how to provide.  I know that's true, because I can't tell you how many times I'd try to refuse things and I'd see the pain rising on their faces.  As if it were a desperate act to prove they loved and supported me.\n\nIt can sound so easy when you say it. \"Just do the right thing\". \"Just don't eat badly\".  \"Just stop eating when you've had enough\".  \"Just eat only organic seeds and water forever, you disgusting jerk\".   But it truly is an addictive behavior that needs to be addressed properly.\n\nAre my food issues gone because I've found a diet that works for me?  Not even a little bit.  But I am learning about myself and what my bad habits used to be, even the ones I didn't even know I was doing.  I have a long road ahead of me and I'll likely need professional assistance at some point.  But until then I'm trying to \"just do the right thing\" as often as possible.",

I know that you were doing what you thought was best, and I'm sure it was textbook health at the time.  I'm so happy to have the information that I do now.

Keto is technically really only any diet causing you to go into a ketogenic metabolism; as such its perfectly possible to make a really unhealthy diet that would be considered keto, if you wanted. Atkins was constructed by a doctor of the same name with specific instructions, food groups allowed, and periods, so its a specific form of ketogenic diet.\n\nFor most people just following a healthy keto diet will get them losing weight, without having to follow something as specific as Atkins'.",

    "postText": "[It's the non scale victories](https://imgur.com/gallery/dIHAjjj) that hit me the hardest. Yeah, it's nice to see the numbers on the scale drop, but moments like this are far more valuable.\n\nI'm flying for the first time in a long time. I've hated flying. I've always been incredibly uncomfortable and never fit in the seats. Buckling my seatbelt has always been a struggle and they usually have to offer me an extension.\n\nBut not so today! Not only do I fit in the seat without worry that I'm encroaching on my fellow passenger's space, I can buckle and have some belt left over!\n\nAs you can see from the photos, when I had this realization I couldn't help but to start crying. Right as my seat neighbor came to sit down.\n\n**Update:**\n\nI've landed in California, and, thanks to free WiFi, all of your comments had me smiling all the way here! Thank you all for the support, and especially for the Reddit Gold and Platinum! (My first Platinum!!)\n\nI'll get a snazzy photo in my suit at the wedding on Saturday and I will definitely post it here for you all! \n\n**Update 2:**\n\nI'm home from the wedding and had a great time! It was requested that I share a photo of me in my suit, so [here it is!]( \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/8zcbh3I)",

It wasn't till last month when I really had to go it got into my head that I'm not that wide anymore and while airline toilets are still disgusting.... I fit just fine.\n\nSo congrats, I know how it feels.  I cried yesterday on a hike that I had loads of trouble on in march last year that was a breeze this time.  ;-)",

At my largest (397), I even stole one of those demo-seatbelt extensions so I wouldn't have to ask for one.\n\nUnfortunately, \\~70 of that 125 came back and now Keto has helped remove 30lbs of that backslide. Good momentum in the right direction now albeit much slower. Still nowhere near my personal worst and don't need the extension (although I still have it).\n\nI savor every skinny flight now and so should you - Congrats &amp; Enjoy.",

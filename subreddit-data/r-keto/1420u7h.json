Besides losing 70 pounds in less than a year, my skin/hair got better. No more oily skin, acne, and even my sweat was cleaner.\n\nIf you are truly on keto (like no carbs, and full ketosis), first of all, congratulations for changing your metabolism successfully.\n\nI'd recommend increase the water intake, or, as others suggested, reduce the dairy slightly.\n\nI personally would just stick with the diet and see what happens.\n\nRemember, your body's main fuel source &amp; metabolism has switched for the first time (most likely) in your life.\n\nYou can always try eliminating (for example) dairy, or (for example) all nuts and see what happens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck",

I also had for yeard ussues with chronic yeast infections  both femilnine and in creases like where my lega attach to my pelivis or under my boobs or in skin folds. \n\nThis tratment helpex that a lot too. though dont do the soak more than once a week if ur doing it tegilarly for acne only. If u have yeast infections, especially ones bad enougb to create sores like i sometimes got, thrn by all means do daily for a bit.\n\nAlso, ive heard intolerancez to dairy can cause this, zo maybe sub ur cheese with alvacado, bacon, prpperoni, or animal fat like what drains off baked chicken, ground beef, etc. Basically use different fats. If dairy is a issue, butter may not be despite bring dairy depending o  ur sensitivity level. Even if butter is ghee usually is safe for those with lactose issues unless a more extreme case. In thay case avoid any fkrm of dairy including butter and ghee and stick with other non dairy fats which are both plant or animal based including eggs.",

My thought was that maybe your body is detoxing and cleansing itself and keto has somehow triggered that and you just need to push through and eventually it will go back to normal.  Or, it could be bad and there is something in the diet causing you to react or break out.  If done right keto is a high fat diet but I don't think that necessarily translates to aggravated acne.",

Manage your detox/adjustment symptoms the best you can and hang in there.\n\nThree weeks isn't a long enough time to get through any dietary adjustment period. I'd say 60 days is adequate for an adjustment period. It's worth it! \n\nIf you cut dairy out for a 2-3 months, try adding it in again, in small amounts and see how your body reacts.",

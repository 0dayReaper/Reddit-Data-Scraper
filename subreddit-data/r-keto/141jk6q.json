I make us keto sandwich for lunch (keto bread from costco, mayo, turkey lunchmeat, cheese, lettuce, avocado)  and then the Green Chef for dinner.  Usually right after our lunch or dinnner, i'm still hungry and then go to town on some sort of a snack (pork rinds....some sort of keto dessert), and i dont think that really helps the weight loss.  \n\nAny recommendations?",

    "postText": "According to the nurse.  Who sat across from me at two dinners last weekend.  Most people who were at the dinners hadn\u2019t seen me in years and didn\u2019t know I lost 110lb from 2018 to 2019.  So they were a little shocked.  She asked how because she and her husband have been unsuccessful.\n\nShe immediately told me I was going to die from liver failure.  I couldn\u2019t help but let out an immediate laugh and then catch myself (thanks bourbon).  She told me she sees young people go into liver failure and die from keto all the time her hospital.   \n\nShe really didn\u2019t like when I told her my doctor has been taking advanced labs every time I see him and is scratching his head.  All measurements have improved.  Everything related to heart, liver and kidneys.  She said the lab must be wrong.  I just smiled and said \u201cThe proof is not in the pudding. Pudding is what the labs say was killing me.\u201d\n\nSo, the Reddit keto saying proves true again.  No one worries if you eat cake for every meal,  but eat clean and people freak out.",

He said that if you don't eat fat, you will die. If you don't eat protein you will die. If you don't eat carbs, you will not die. Your body will get what it needs from the fat and proteins. \n\nSo two out of three doctors agree, Keto is cool. \ud83d\ude1c",

Unfortunately I have familial hypercholesterolemia so keto didn't drop my LDL very much. I take a self injection called repatha that got that dialed in. Cholesterol went from 393 to 192, LDL went from 302 to 115, HDL went from 36 to 54, triglycerides from 281 to 116 ( a low of 86 on keto). I would like to get my triglycerides down into the 60's so I am about to go keto again.  My family had horrible rates of heart disease that killed almost every male on my fathers side and he has had stints put in every major artery and nearly died himself. Keto is fantastic at reducing inflammation and I respond really well to it. It drives me nuts when people tell me keto will kill me or give me a heart attack. That's the freaking sugar, starch, and highly inflammatory refined vegetable oils that do that, not meat and butter.",

She\u2019s right about ketoacidosis, it makes your blood very acidic and has consequences on liver, kidneys and other organs if left untreated. Ironically, you get ketoacidosis from overindulgence in carbohydrates in those who are predisposed or have diabetes. (It\u2019s more common in younger people who have type I diabetes, essentially their pancreas doesn\u2019t make insulin, and all the sugar they eat cannot be used well by the body, so body starts burning fat fast causing high ketones to build up. If you have even a bit of insulin, you will not build up ketones fast enough in the blood to enter ketoacidosis. Ketones=acidic). \n\nEdit: it\u2019s good to memorize the word \u201cketoacidosis\u201d to diffuse the situation. Some people are legitimately concerned for your health. When I first started doing it I just called it \u201cAtkins\u201d diet, cause essentially that. Older people seem to understand that better. \n\nOf course, then you get \u201cwell didn\u2019t Dr Atkins die\u201d response.. you just can\u2019t win I guess\n\nEdit 2: I don\u2019t think the nurse is ignorant or uneducated, I personally would trust my life to a hospital nurse, especially an older that\u2019s been around, any day. Keto is not a medical condition, it\u2019s a diet label just like \u201csouth beach diet\u201d or others. She works with people who have serious chronic diseases, not likely to be familiar with a diet relatively healthy people follow.  Yes you enter a state called ketosis, but you really would have to explain the biochemistry. She understand it if someone sat her down and talked to her about it I\u2019d assume.",

Someone doing low carb with a functioning pancreas isn't going to go into DKA because they won't have high blood sugar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKetosis is not the same as ketoacidosis.",

Because a person in ketosis does not experience high glucose levels at the same time as they do with ketoacidosis, the condition is not dangerous. The worst thing that may happen is you develop\u00a0bad breath.\" The reasons we wouldn't have high blood glucose as well as ketones is because we aren't eating a sugary diet.",

The body then has a overwhelming response to the lack of energy so it breaks down fat at a very high rate, far higher than we will ever achieve in ketosis. This makes your ketones and your blood sugar very very high which make your blood ph very low, or acidic. Your blood ph has to be within 7.35-7.45 to be conducive with enzyme functioning, and life. So it is a life threatening condition. I remember reading that it was one of the biggest causes of death in young people that are type one diabetic.

            "comment": "I would make 3 points to the nurse:\n1. \u201cIt is virtually impossible for a person with a functioning pancreas to have ketoacidosis, where ketone levels are 3 to 10 times higher than nutritional ketosis. \u201c\n2. \u201cI am in far more danger of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease than ketoacidosis. How do you make fois gras (fatty liver)? You force feed the bird grain. \u201c\n3. Ketosis is a natural state that most people enter after 8-12 hours of eating. Children are born in ketosis and stay in for most of the time they nurse. Do you really think people die of liver failure after missions a meal or three, which was common for most of human history? Inuit, Massai and other groups are constantly in ketosis. Most Northern Europeans were in ketosis most of the winter hundreds of years ago in the absence of fresh fruit and vegetables, eating meat and cheese.",

As long as you are drinking enough water, which is part of keto anyway, what would be the issue? I lost 30lbs, my blood pressure dropped from prehypertension to well within normal. I have more energy than I ever had and I'm sleeping better. I would love for that nurse to explain how any of that is a bad thing.",

Since I started Keto last October, several of the other nurses have started too. I started my Keto journey with the help of a weight loss doctor and I\u2019m now maintaining my weight ( a few pounds under my goal weight). One of the nurses sat and asked me about Keto today.  I encouraged her to do some research and call with any questions. It\u2019s funny that a bunch of nurses are on the diet or they are considering it. My sister in law who puts down everything, even Keto at Christmas time ( she gave me the whole speech on how I was destroying my liver) is now on Keto. She said she did her research and is now a firm believer in the diet. I love the nay-sayers. I\u2019m 37 with 2 kids and I can fit into some clothes from high school and college. I know the hard part will be maintaining it, but I have a pretty big reward if I keep the weight off for a year.",

I straight up don't understand where this person is coming from on the liver failure thing.\n\nLike even being charitable and assuming they got confused between ketosis and ketoacidosis... [ketoacidosis is only barely linked to liver dysfunction](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jdr/2013/967097/). As you see from the study, only really prealbumin was massively affected and even then only in severe DKA.\n\nEssentially what I'm saying is you don't die of liver failure from DKA. There are much more pressing concerns in that state. You generally die of cerebral oedema (brain too big for skull) or hypokalaemia when you go to fix it (heartbeat goes screwy).",

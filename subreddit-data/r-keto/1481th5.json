Fresh grated parmesan mixed in works well in most situations. \n\n\nForm into balls or patties. Cook any way you see fit. I like doing them as a batch in the oven for meal prep. Also good in the cast iron. Make a sauce from the drippings.",

I'd be smash burgering I reckon. Just meat, hot cast iron, a crack of salt and pepper and a sturdy spatula to mash it down flat on entry. Delicious.",

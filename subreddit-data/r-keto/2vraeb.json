Keto makes it so much easier...those psycho cravings where you feel like you'd sell your mom for a bag of chips just don't exist, right?  \n\nI have a close friend who is a night nurse and should probably lose about 80 lbs (guessing).  She won't try keto - I convinced her once and she couldn't even make it through a day - she says she needs chocolate, Mexican, and carbs.  I just think she'd FEEL so much better and physically stable if she could get through the first few days :-(.  \n\nI'm so glad it is helping your depression, too. Thanks for posting; you are very inspirational.  :-) ",

I honestly just forget to eat sometimes because I'm never hungry and it is definitely nothing like how hungry I'd get before keto. \n\nI've been trying to get my brother to do keto because I worry about him. He's started it a few times but then always ends up eating something that he shouldn't. I remember thinking that I could never live without bread/pasta/carbs but I really don't miss them... as long as I don't cheat. \n\nThe depression/anxiety thing is so weird, I never in a million years would have thought a WOE could solve so many problems! =) ",

I don't crave those carbs too much, unless I \"cheat\" and eat some. Then it takes a couple days to shake it. I hate to say \"cheat\" - because it's just life. I don't totally forbid them in my life. For Thanksgiving I had a bunch of family over and made the traditional carb loaded spread and I had some. And then I paid for it by feeling crappy. I know I won't always be able to eat Keto. Life happens. But I know I feel better and consistently lose weight when I do. ",

You are so correct about tone and being preachy - I think she tunes me out because I've always, since we were kids, been into running/nutrition and she sees me as having issues.

When you get really excited and passionate about something you just wanna scream it from the top of the world! Problem is most ppl don't wanna hear it no matter how awesome it is. \n\nAlso, another huge issue is ppl won't change until THEY want to. You can bring all the science and evidence and B&amp;As and recipes to them, but until they make the decision to better themselves, it won't really happen. And even if you do convince them to do it, they might not stick with it. Just try to lead by example and maybe show them pics of all the food you can eat (uhh... bacon cheeseburgers everyday w/ mayo and low sugar ketchup? yes please.) ",

But I've converted a few people by doing exactly what keeeunjung suggested. Start cooking for her! \"I lost 30 lbs eating stuff like this!\" \n\nThe way I hooked my boyfriend was to give him a day of keto foods I know he loves. For breakfast 3 strips of bacon, 2 scrambled eggs with red peppers, serranos and spinach in bacon grease with cheese,  half an avocado and a slice of smoked swiss, brought him lunch of 20+ wings and celery with bluecheese from wingstop and made pork laab lettuce wraps and tom kha gai for dinner and asked, \"Think you can eat like this every day?\"  The answer was \"Of course\" so now he's down at least 6 lbs in the 2.5/3 weeks we've been on strict keto and he flung his ring off accidentally, pants feel a bit looser already and naturally eating less calories without feeling restricted! I remind him \"and you did that eating steak, bacon, butter, wings, chili, cheese and eggs every day\" :D  He's sold now!   Actually taking initiative to show him what he could eat is the thing that convinced him.  \n\nI'd also send him a lot of progress photos from here, which tend to be really impressive and say \"either they are lying or this works.\" ",

Very few people can pull that off.\n\nInstead, lose as much as possible. Might be 80, might be 120! Be realistic. If you set a goal you damn well make sure it's realistic. Otherwise you're simply setting up a disappointment some time in the future.\n\nOf course you need goals but make them week to week in the beginning and slowly find out what your body can do. Then month goals later.\n\nAlso, avoid only focusing on weight. Why not say: I want to remove one X from my shirt size. That's a goal that's  directly related to how good you look and that can turn into a huge motivator when people start commenting. \n\nBest of luck!",

    "postText": "Alright keto family, I'm going to keep this one as short as possible. I started out at 545 lbs in January 2016 and as of this morning, I am 220 lbs. That's 325 lbs in a little over 3 yrs and it's all thanks to low carb /atkins /keto. My goal is to lose 10 more lbs and settle at 210 lbs. \n\nI'm a firm believer that anyone can lose weight, you just need to find something that works for you and stick to it. Sometimes it just takes a little determination and a little stubbornness because I'm just an ordinary guy that wanted to make a change, nothing special.\n\nCommonly asked questions:\n\n\u2022 SW: 545 at 25 yrs old, now I'm 220 at 28\n\u2022 I'm 6'3\n\u2022 I did atkins for about a year and a half, keto the rest\n\u2022 I really don't go to the gym. I'll go for like a week, every 6 months but I need to in order to bulk up\n\u2022 Yes there is loose skins. It's not the prettiest but it's there. Maybe one day I'll get it taken care of but paying and finishing school take priority \n\u2022 Yes my health was super shitty, it's much better now. Don't know of any permeate damage, but hopefully not. \n\nI really hope this post helps encourage someone that is wanting to start, has started and is having issues, or is a vet but had stalled. I can't tell you how many times I've stalled but I kept it going because I refused to give up. *Que stubbornness*. Like I've said, I'm just an ordinary guy. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/oWnSukv\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold and silver kind strangers! I'm trying to reply to questions as quickly as I can, I didn't really expect such an awesome response. This sub continues to amaze me. ",

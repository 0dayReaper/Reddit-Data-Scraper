Now I get NO grief at all, no pain, no aggro. All this fixed itself after I started keto.\n\nI have a second inflammatory condition as well where the pain for that has stopped, i was told it was incurable. Mental stuff!!!",

Shits a miracle diet man I swear.",

Keto has been at least anecdotally proven to reduce inflammation and I'm certain there's scientific studies as well.\n\nBut man the mental effects are insane too, I'm so clear nowadays, no anxiety, awake without being tired, best sleep I've ever got \n\nThe only negative is that I can no longer lift as much as I could before but I was mega bulking back then, now I'm 2 stone down from there so it's expected. Really toned tho l, can still bench 80kg for reps, swings and roundabouts",

I always lose about 15-20% while cutting, bulk will bring it back I\u2019m sure, but don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna be able to do a dirty bulk again if it means fucking my knee up. As long as I can train I\u2019m sound.",

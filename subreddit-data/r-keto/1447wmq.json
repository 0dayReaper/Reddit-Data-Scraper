    "postText": "What type of magnesium do you guys use and when during the day to help you supplement? My goal is looking to stay regular (pooping). I have Doctors Best Mag Glycinate but I haven\u2019t noticed any improvement with digestion or regulations (maybe i\u2019m not using enough or using it at the wrong time?). Also which foods should I eat more of to get magnesium naturally as well?\n\nI\u2019m also looking into Calm\u2019s mag citrate. Thinking of doing citrate in the morning and glycinate at night.",

I did not, and a couple of years later it's quite easy to end up where you started.  It starts small (\"Oh, I'll ease up on the 'no bread' thing....\") and pretty soon you're eating poorly again, and it seems (at least for me) much harder to get back on track.  Don't make that same mistake!! \n\nBut most of all, congrats!  ",

What works a treat for me is the Atkin's five pound rule: if you gain back more than 5 pounds, you go straight back on the diet. It's kept my weight off for 15 years now; I used to be over 200 pounds and have no intention of ever going back there.  The five pound regain allowance allows for the water weight to return, but little more. I finished keto on April 30th, then regained three pounds, and am still sitting there three months later. \n\n\nIf you do go off on a vacation and regain weight, make sure you try to lose it again as soon as you are back. My goal is to lose it in the same number of days it took to gain it. Did that - just - last month. Gained 3.5 pounds in six days, then lost it again by the sixth day home exactly! The trick is to do it **immediately** after you return; don't leave it for a while, or it will be harder to do. Keto is **such** a useful tool for this! We are so lucky to have it. In the bad old days of low fat dieting I couldn't lose even a pound. \n\n\nI also belong to a small maintenance group. There are six of us, and we report back to each other on the last day of every month. Being accountable to others really works for me, especially with the friendly rivalry! \n \nWhen I reintroduce carbs, I find for me they vary a lot. Eating fruit, I don't gain weight, (and don't lose it either). Eating the occasional potato, and my weight stays the same. But bread? Guaranteed my weight will go up without fail. I weigh myself every day so have a pretty good idea now of what carbs cause the most damage and what don't. Wheat is out, for sure. ",

For me, a carb is like crack - it doesn't make me feel full for very long, and it gives me serious cravings for more carbs.  Proteins don't do that to me, and quite the opposite - eating protein makes me feel more full and give me less cravings.  Those carb cravings lead to more caloric intake, so even though \"a calorie is a calorie\", in practice the result is very different. \n\nI used to think I didn't know what it felt like to have an addiction, but after doing keto for a while and then not, I can very much relate to people who have an addiction.

I've tried a few diets, none very seriously as I wasn't way overweight. \n\nAs soon as I announced (to myself-- never in public lest ye be judged harshly) I was dieting, two things happened: I felt hungry &amp; I thought mostly of what my next meal was going to be. I had varying levels of success-- mostly related to increased activity. \n\nDifferent with keto. Caveat though: I started the diet upon entering a 'Biggest Loser' contest at work. But I had also been lurking on this sub for some time, reading the info. \n\nWell, the diet worked. I finished second place in both the back-to-back contests we had. They've been done for a bit, &amp; I'm sticking with the diet. I'm not hungry. I'm enjoying the benefits of much improved sleep plus the anti inflammatory effect this diet gives me. \n\nCICO is part of this. I keep under my calories. I am doing more activity &amp; not eating those calories. I'm pretty strict &amp; add in the odd bit of fresh fruit only-- which I don't count as a cheat-- I fit it in. \n\nBut keto is the only one that's helped me feel better &amp; healthier than any other diet plan. The reading I've done here &amp; elsewhere has helped me understand it's not just the calories, but what else you're eating/or *not eating* that's worked for so many of us. \n\nGood discussion I think.

Over 3,000 people have now congratulated you by means of an up vote, yet this miserable specimen of humanity doesn't have the good grace to express his admiration of your remarkable achievement, but instead chooses to make a derogatory comment about your hair, which is absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with your weight loss - which is why you posted in the first place! And since we are all strangers to each other, none of us know who might get upset by such a snide comment. \n",

You're trying to be nice, but you're being dishonest, and that's not nice.\n\nWhen you lose 70 pounds, you're gonna need a different haircut.  The shape of your face changes, your features are more prominent, and when those things happen, you need to get a different cut to fit your face and features.  Ask any stylist, and they'll tell you the same thing.",

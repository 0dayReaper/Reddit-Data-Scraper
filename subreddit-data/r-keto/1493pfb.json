    "postText": "Have you ever got out of ketosis by eating vegetables?In my last time eating keto, I ate more vegetables (tomatoes, onions, sometimes carrots) than I could fit in my macros, and I still lost weight every day and felt the benefits of ketosis.\n\nDo you think that eating more carbohydrates from vegetables is not the same as from flour and sugar, or that it doesn't matter where they come from for ketosis?\n\nEDIT: I have posted a question in other subs to get opinions on vegetable and fruit consumption and weight loss from different points of view:\n\n[Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/14941ki/vegetables_and_fruit_do_they_make_you_fat/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n[Insulin Resistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/InsulinResistance/comments/14942fl/vegetables_and_fruit_do_they_make_you_fat/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n[PCOS](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOSloseit/comments/1494253/vegetables_and_fruit_do_they_make_you_fat/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)[loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOSloseit/comments/1494253/vegetables_and_fruit_do_they_make_you_fat/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)",

With this branded one, I was surprised how much it still tastes like salsa more than pickles, and the pickles really work well with the salsa texture. I'm sure you could make an even better one on your own but I'm going to work through the jars I got and then take my favorite pickles and try making my own.",

            "comment": "There is a qualitative aspect to carbs from broccoli compares to a refined flour.\n\nIt correlates with the GI index mostly.\n\n10g of carbs from broccoli come with fibre and this lowers the absorption rate and therefore the insulin spike is smaller.\n\nYou might get the same total insulin response but it will be a lower response over a longer duration.\n\nThen there's the associative benefits from the food choice.  Broccoli has more nutrients than refines flour or sugar.\n\nCarbs are the same, how they are delivered can make a difference.  Fundamentally it's still a volume issue, both will kick you out of ketosis if you eat enough of them.",

It's not ketosis unless you are not eating starch, and it can be confirmed with test strips. Some of us get too hungry and need an actual state of ketosis to make the process work efficiently.\n\nLong term weight loss is largely a state of mind. If it feels good and is working, you're likely to succeed. When people are feeling hungry all the time, they don't succeed as easily. This is why filling up on green, leafy veggies helps; they are low calorie, high fiber, and low starch.",

I eat a lot of vegetables that aren't considered keto (acorn and butternut squash are my favorites), but I stay under 50 carbs and never have trouble.\n\nSomeone using keto to treat epilepsy isn't going to need the same kind of food as someone who has PCOS or someone who's trying to do a bulk and gain weight. For your average person, a carb is a carb is a carb and it's the total that's important and not which ones. Sure the vegetables have more vitamins and fiber, but when you're barely eating any carbs, you're not going to eat enough, say sugar, to cause the health issues you see with the Standard American Diet, so any carbs go. Now, for some people with ibs, vegetables can cause a lot of GI pain and they might do better using their carbs for different food. However, if you're just trying to manage PCOS, eating mostly meat and vegetables with some berries will prevent a lot of the insulin problems associated with PCOS. I could save all my carbs for 1/2 cup of rice (about 22 carbs) but I'm going to get wicked hungry after eating that, but salmon, acorn squash, and roasted kale will keep me full (even though a cup of cubed acorn squash also had about 20 carbs).\n\nAgain, it just depends on your goals, what you're trying to accomplish with low carb, and what health issues you're dealing with.

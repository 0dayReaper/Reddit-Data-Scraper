    "postText": "And I'm finding it super frustrating, I feel like this is usually the cause behind my eventual relapse to eating junk carbs that occurs after every 3/4 weeks.\n\nI hit 2500 cals per day easy, usually nearly 200g of protein, 160g of fat and carbs I hit around 30 and I try to finish eating around 5pm latest but by the time 7pm rolls around I feel like I could eat anothet whole meal. \n\nI am pretty active as I'll do an hour of weight lifting per day with at least 5k steps of walking, days were I don't lift I'll still go for a long walk for an hour. Apps say my tdee is around 2500 so I'm hitting maintenance cals which is really what I want, I'm aiming for slow body recomposition. \n\nAnyone else experience this and how do you deal with it? All the tricks of things like drinking lots of water, or eating more fats and protein just doesn't apply to me cos I do all those things already.",

That's why you are not full.\n\nFat makes you feel full, but depending on your weight I would up the protein for adequate repair.  u/shiplesp is also right.  200g of protein is not the same as 200g of meat.\n\nFor instance, a 200g ribeye steak is 40-50g of protein.   Essentially, whatever the weight of the item is (meat) then consider protein to be 1/4 to 1/3 of it.\n\nSo to hit 200g of protein daily you need to be looking at a little under a kilo of protein sources per day.\n\nWe would really need your height and weight and goals to be able to say more, but as a wild guess, your body is telling you something.  You are not maintaining, you are in deficit.\n\nRemember this though (and you can check the wiki)  **Keto** is defined **purely** by low/no carbohydrate.  The mix of protein and fat is completely up to you and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nIf you want an 80% protein 20% fat mix, that is up to you.  Same as 50/50 or the reverse.  I eat far more of calories from protein than most on this sub but I am 120KG and lifting weights every day.  The mix can be whatever you want.\n\n**My routine**\n\n* 2 eggs scrambled with double cream, butter, italian seasoning and pepper, 1/2 avocado or 1/2 mozzarella some rocket\n* Rocket/dark green lettuce, spinach salad with 1/2 tomato, 100g of Red Leicester cheese, couple of radishes, some mayo, some oil\n* Konjac noodles with beef and broccoli or a steak and salad\n* Greek yoghurt with cinnamon and a handful of berries and a portion of chopped nuts\n* 150g pork steak and 50g of cheese before bed\n* A litre of hibiscus tea or other tea\n\nSimply switch out the proteins for others (salmon/lamb/cheddar,cottage cheese etc) but the salad and eggs and cream and avocado is daily).",

This happened to me (hence why I tried \nketo 4x before without success because I kept being hungry around the same time you are right now), the 5th and last time I tried keto (now) I made a bit more of research and understood that the reason I was ravenous all the time was because it wasn\u2019t going to take me 2 weeks to get fat adapted but rather longer, so I was eating too many carbs, I wasn\u2019t take my electrolytes and I wasn\u2019t eating enough fat because if I did I wouldn\u2019t be in a caloric deficit\u2026\n\nSo after knowing this, I made these changes and felt better and within no time I stopped being hungry \n\n* reduced carbs to max 15gr net (no guesstimating, simply weighing everything)\n* took electrolytes everyday (make sure they have no glucose!!) \n* focused on eating fat till I felt satiated. Which was difficult at first but with time and perseverance it started working. \n* dropped all \u201cketo\u201d labeled substitute and ate real food \n* Patience and time \n\nAfter you are fat-adapted you can worry about caloric deficit, until then, take it easy you are just making sure the engine starts running and this takes a bit of time :)",

            "comment": "First, double check your macros. They look sus.  Too much protein.  Are you weightlifting?\n\nSecond, increase your fat intake.  Try the whole Ghee and Coconut oil coffee instead of breakfast.  Really try to up the fat.\n\nThird, eat lunch at 12pm, dinner at 5-6pm, and save 100-200 calories throughout the day for an evening snack.  Pork Rinds if you want crunchy, Chocolate Fat Bombs if you want creamy, Kirkland Keto Ice Cream Bars if you want dessert, a London Fog if you want a nice hot drink (lots of heavy cream), Hell, a PB sandwich (keto bread, no sugar PB) if you're looking for savory.  Whatever floats your boat.  Hell, eat a Haas Avocado!\n\nIt sounds like you're trying to quit eating by 5pm.  WHY?  I don't quit eating until like 8pm (sleep at 10).  What's the importance of no food in the afternoon?  I.F.?  If it's I.F., then your dinner needs to be FATTY to keep you satiated.  None of this grilled chicken salad nonsense.  Chuck Roast Beef Kabobs or fatty pork chops are the way to go.  Pulled pork will do you good there too.  Pot roast springs to mind, eating big blubbers of fat, that's the  best part anyhow, will also keep you full longer.\n\nI'd love to see what you're eating that's making you  hungry 2 hours after eating dinner.  It's not enough fat to keep you full.\n\nI'm 5'9\" weigh 195, and I eat sometimes WAY too little with my keto diet.  MyFitnessPal yells at me at least once a week that 1100 calories isn't enough.  I agree, but I'm stuffed with my dinner choices.  Whole roasted chicken on the bbq grill, skin, fat, and all with some mixed grilled veggies done in olive oil ends up being only 600 cal or so (I usually get full on one leg+thigh).  A Cobb salad with blue cheese is HUGE and I'm stuffed to the breaking point at the end....500 calories or so.  I actually have to force myself to eat more sometimes.  Like 2-3 hours after lunch I sometimes have to have a keto bar (Advance makes these) just to get another 150 calories.  I'm still full from my asian-style salmon and spinach salad from lunch.  A big day for me is like 2500 calories.  That's a Burger (no bun) from the greasy bar across the street for lunch after Keto Coffee breakfast and a 10 oz T-Bone with veg for dinner.  \n\nThat's why Keto works for me, I'm already too full to snack.",

Some people need the lower carbs to start producing ketones.\n\nAlso, you say you make it to 3/4 weeks before giving up. You probably should try and stick it out a week or two more because around the 30 day mark of being in ketosis, your body becomes adapted to using fat for fuel and you'll really start to feel the therapeutic benefits of the ketogenic way of life.\n\nAlso if you're weightlifting, I'd recommend eating a couple hundred more calories a day as lifting requires HELLA tons energy.",

            "comment": "&gt; I am pretty active as I'll do an hour of weight lifting per day\n\n&gt; Apps say my tdee is around 2500\n\nThe apps are likely wrong at your level. TDEE estimation is fine if you fit the model they're targetting. The more active and athletic you are, the less \"average\" you are and the more you'll skew outside of that. Strength training even more so as apps don't generally account for the higher energy cost of maintaining 1lb of muscle vs 1lb of fat.\n\nWhen I'm more active (1hr weights and 30+mins of cardio per day), my TDEE gets to ~3500kcal / day to maintain weight. When I'm more sedentary, it drops much closer to 2000kcal/day.\n\nAre you tracking your weight and body composition right now? Are you consistently gaining, losing, or maintaining weight?\n\nPersonally I'd bump the calories up. 250-500 kcal / day would be a good starting point. Keep tracking your weight and if you notice it consistently trends upwards after a month, you can make some adjustments. But that'll give you a lot more room to hit satiety.\n\nI'd also say you'll be better off finding some foods that mimic the junk carbs you end up craving. For me, Rebel ice cream is enough to sate my sweet tooth whenever I get a craving, but not carby/bad enough to lead to a full binge or kick me out of keto. Halo Top ice cream is another good option. Find what works for you.\n\nLastly, check out /r/ketogains and looking into more lifting-oriented advice. Kinda like how the TDEE apps are great for the average Joe, but not so great for regular lifters, /r/keto is great for the average person, less so for the athlete.",

This is important because when you break keto (it happens to everyone) it takes less time to get back into fat adaptation because your cells mitochondria have it INGRAINED into the DNA to adapt quicker.\n\nOh, btw, I forgot to mention that becoming fat adapted literally changes your DNA. How cool is that?\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8836029/",

You can also just take a 3 days break from it and see if you're causing your problem by burnout....",

But 2k calories is a reasonable basal metabolic rate and it looks to me like you are doing more than 500 cKals of exercise.\n\nI did my own TDEE the other week and it was over 3k\n\nLastly, if you are hungry eat something.

I love that he mentions in his videos that what he used to think was right he no longer believes in... I guess being on the bleeding edge of keto can have it's pros and cons. \n\nAnyway, a few things I would like to add (you probably already know all this as I can tell you try to stay informed) maybe you're not drinking enough water? Maybe you have a deficiency in vitamins or minerals and your body is trying to tell you that? Fats are the most calorie dense so I would expect them to be the most satiating. But, I'm not a scientist or doctor so take it with a grain of salt.. like your water (\u2060\u2022\u2060\u203f\u2060\u2022\u2060)",

But I think that feeling full isn\u2019t necessarily a must, like being satiated and being satisfied from eating are 2 different things. If I hit my macros and I get enough water and I feel a bit peckish at times I hope it\u2019s just giving my body a chance to metabolize some of my stored fat",

I used to track every single thing and it led me down this obsessive rabbit hole that would then lead to binges as I was not only stressed out by all these extra numbers &amp; checking, but I was also feeling in a chokehold by this too. \n\nNow I don\u2019t even look at calories. I\u2019ve lost 78lbs. I\u2019ve been doing this for 7 months (the longest run I\u2019ve had without breaking &amp; binging). I figure if I\u2019m eating low carb and clean anyhow the calories will be low. And I feed into my cravings in a healthy way, not suppress them so they volcano out of control. (Ie: keto ice cream, keto chips, whatever)",

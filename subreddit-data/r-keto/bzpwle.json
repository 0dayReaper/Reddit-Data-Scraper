Maybe your drinking is problematic, maybe not.  Either way, this book will inform you thoroughly on the subject so you can decide for yourself whether you're getting more out of it than it costs you financially, personally, etc.",

With that said, front biased and rear biased core workouts (ab and low back) are probably the most important areas to keep strong for injury reduction.  \n\nMy point is: ab workouts are important for health reasons, but ab workouts generally give you larger abs that could almost look like a gut on some people, which is good for health and strength, but can be discouraging for people trying to gain a certain look.",

My belly looks flaccid, not because of skin, but weak abs.\n\nCould you give some hints about exercise routines (frequency, exercises), diet (calories counting? What eat? When?), Sleeping patterns, etc? Anything that you think made real difference for you.\n\nThank a Lot",

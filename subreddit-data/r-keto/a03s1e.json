    "postText": "I went to buy Christmas gifts for my 2 girlfriends. As I was getting ready to go to the register,  my dear husband says, \"You'd look great in that top.\" I rolled my eyes because I haven't bought anything off the rack in a store in over 15 years. I have been wearing 5X-6X and buying online. So I quietly said to him that even though the Keto lifestyle has been working on us for the past 7 months, I doubted that anything there would fit me, especially a pretty fancy fitted party top. He picked up the biggest size on the rack... a very small looking 2X and handed it to me.\nI reluctantly tried it on... O.M.G. Yup... I fit into a 2X &amp; it looked good!!!\nNow, my butt still demands a 3-4X... but it's progress!\nI showed him.\nHe smiled and gave a thumbs up. \nI broke down in tears in the aisle.\nOver 15 years......... and he bought &amp; picked my 1st new wardrobe item off the rack.\nI'm 90# down in 18 months but 73 of them are Keto in 7 months. I've skulked around here for months.\nYall make me laugh.\nAnd hope.\nAnd believe in myself after decades of failures.  I've learned that my PCOS and cancer background, etc hindered my success.\nOh and today my hubby saw his Dr.\nHis numbers were all in normal range. His A1C for T2D showed 6.8 -- under the Dr. Target of 7.\nHe was taken off Lantus/insulin. In a few months the doc is considering removing the metformin too.\nGod is great. \nKeto is good.\nAnd yall are crazy....\nTo paraphrase the country song.\nPeace, yall.... only another 170 to my goal of 160... I'm 335 down from 425.\nShooting for 100+ for my 35th Anniversary in April 2019.\nIt'll happen...\n\n",

They believe it is because glucose cannot get in to damaged brain cells to provide fuel for the mitochondria, so the cells die. However, ketones can 'get in through the back door' and provide fuel for the cell so it can reverse damage. \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18625458/\n\n\nKetones can also act as signaling metabolites - will hunt for paper on it, hang on.....\n\n\nhttps://www.cell.com/trends/endocrinology-metabolism/fulltext/S1043-2760(13)00156-2\n\nNewman works at the Buck Institute of research on Aging, and it doing some exciting stuff in the fields of Alzheimer's. \n",

I weigh myself everyday. Some days I rejoice and other days I get gloomy. But then I consider how far I have come... 1 lb... 5 lb... The next 10 lbs... And I begin to see I have lost 1 Jack Russell at 20 lb! Then I lost two Jack Russells at 40 lb and 60 pounds was three Jack Russells... And 70 lb was three Jack Russells and my pet duck! I actually have 3 rescue Jacks and a duck. Now I'm beginning to see things in terms of buckling my seatbelt without the extender or zipping up my coat all the way top the bottom and being able to sit in it! It's the little things that make me smile now. Life is a journey. And we are already farther along than those who is chosen to sit on the couch and do nothing. For the record I don't exercise because I have severe arthritis in my knees. But I lift weights for my upper body and to take care of the turkey wings under my arms LOL! You've got this... Just do it for you and the best you you're going to be is yet to come.",

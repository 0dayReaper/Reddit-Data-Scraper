Keto has honestly saved my life and while I know it's not for everyone for me it has worked wonders on my physical and mental health and has allowed me to stay consistent with my new eating habits and my exercise regime.",

I'm looking forward to getting there and staying there for the rest of my life.\n\nIt's totally possible for you to get under 200 lbs, just be patient, and be kind to yourself. Sometimes it feels like you're not advancing, but remember weight loss is not linear, and everyone loses weight at different rates. In the first few months I was losing weight at a rate of like 10+ lbs a month, now I'm more like 6 lbs a month. You'll get there in due time with persistence and some self-love. Don't give up, and good luck.",

But smelling it? Oh damn. My advice is always try to keep the stuff you don't want to eat out of the house to keep temptation away. When you're out with friends yo eat and you just really want that beer, or that slice of pie, or those fries just ask yourself... is it worth it? There are always thing you can drink and eat when you're out with friends and family so you don't just sit there and stare at them. No reason to not enjoy yourself.\n\nLearn and make recipes that will take the place of the things you miss. Me for example, I missed bread a lot so I eat chaffles--I make mine with mozzarella, egg, almond flour, and baking powder. Made myself a burger and fries with chaffles as the buns since I was craving a burger and fries. I made jicama fries instead of potatoes fries, had some sugar free ketchup and it was delicious.\n\nI posted about the burger so you can see.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/11oylkc/wanted_a_burger/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button",

    "postText": "Hey guys!\n\nI have really weird problem. I am on keto since 20.5 so its been almost one month -23 days. At the beggining a was more low carb now i am totally 0 carbs. I get carbs only from tomato or smth like that.  First 2-3 weeks i was feeling really good i lose weight and body fat. I can also see my ribs for a little\ud83d\ude2d. With keto i also do intermittent fastin sometimes even for 20 hours. I also walk almost every day for 7-9 km ( about 5-6 miles). The problem is - last couple of days i feel really fat ( i didnt gained weight ) but like when i come from walking i just feel so fat in face, neck and my stomach, that i cant even sit normally. Like my stomach is swollen. Also my face. I dont know hy this happen to me is this in my head or what? I feel like i was better looking when i was eating junk food etc. Should i trust the process and just dont give up? Maybe i am too obsessed with losing weight cuz i constantly everyday takimg pictures of me etc\n\nThanks for your answers :)",

    "postText": "Okay, I've been around Reddit for a decade. Finally joined 7 years ago- have so much anxiety about posting that I only have 70 karma. I'd promise I'm not a troll, but isn't that what trolls do? Anxiety be damned the results I'm seeing from keto are so life changing that I feel compelled to post if it helps another person in my position. (This is not medical advice, I'm not a doctor, common sense rules and of course you should be in charge of your medical care and work with your medical team.)\n\n\nI'm a 39 year old mom of 4- 2 of my children have special needs. I have narcolepsy, EDS, POTS, IBS, Lipedema, MCAS, and a slew of other autoimmune issues. My energy is so low- my cortisol sky high, I was getting insulin resistent. After trying traditional meds to \"fix\" problems and not having success, but having more health problems develop I turned to more natural methods over the years. I have a lot of supplements, tried all organic, plant based, AIP, so many different diets. My BMR was so low. I was eating 1100 calories a day and gaining weight- I got up to 205 lbs on a 5'6\" frame. I still go to my primary care doctor who has been supportive of more natural remedies. I haven't bridged the keto subject with him, but I think the results will speak for themselves. \n\n\nWith all the reading I did on my health problems there were signs pointing to keto. They didn't come from mainstream medicine, but keto kept coming up. I tried once about 5 years ago, but didn't make it through the \"keto flu\" period.  I couldn't function and had too many demands on my time to keep up with my kids/work etc... This time before trying I found the group here and did a lot of reading. I learned that \"keto flu\" is an electrolyte imbalance. Due to POTS I have tons of electrolyte options and salt tablets on hand. Reading so many experiences and tips from real people gave me the motivation to try again.  \n\n\nI bought the \"pee sticks\" even though I know they're not the end all be all, they let me know my body was doing something besides feeling worse. After a few days I learned to manage my electrolytes better. Now I can address it before it gets bad.  \n\n\nIn the 7 weeks that I've been in ketosis I've lost nearly 20 lbs. That is a huge win for me. I know a lot of it was water weight because I'd always go up and down the same 6-8 lbs. every couple of days. It's staying off now, and I can see the swelling, inflammation, and now fat starting to melt away. As a vain person that is a huge win, but the increases in my health are the real story.\n\n\n\nAfter the first couple of weeks I have been able to go through most days without laying down to rest. I haven't thrown up once from chronic pain. The pain levels are down 40%. I'm hoping to see an improvement in sleep soon. The brain fog is lighter. I'm still not a \"normal healthy\" person, but I can't expect to undo nearly 4 decades in a few weeks.  \n\n\nPossible TMI, but for the first time in a decade I haven't been dealing with IBS issues. Having regular solid stools is something I never expected. There have been a couple of days where I've eaten something that's thrown me back into it- now I'm learning things to avoid, as opposed to that being my norm.  \n\n\nIt is amazing to not be hungry all of the time. My sleep doctor told me that due to narcolepsy, and because the part of the brain that craves sleep and the part that craves food are so close together, it's normal to constantly feel hungry with my disorder. It was somewhat true- I'd feel hungry, but also nauseated most of the time, and a lot of the time I felt worse after eating. Now eating is in the background. There is no panic feeling about finding something to eat and hoping it doesn't make me feel worse.  \n\n\nI'm probably still doing \"dirty keto.\" I haven't tracked everything and am using allulose, and monkfruit sweetener in things I bake. I still have a hard time eating a lot of meat, but for now nuts, cheese, and when I feel like eating meat, are doing a great job providing satiation. I'll often have a homemade creme brul\u00e9e for breakfast- with berries for the topping. So it's heavy cream, egg yolk, a little allulose, and the berries. I eat until I'm full- sometimes it's just a few bites, sometimes all of it. I make almond flour/peanut butter/dutch pressed cocoa powder cookies, and almond flour cheese crackers for a quick snack. Lunch is often a salad with cheese, and a full fat dressing. I add meat in if it sounds good. It's amazing how little sweetener it takes for things to taste \"sweet\" now. I aim for 20-25 net carbs a day. Most days I'm not hungry for dinner. If I am I eat something that fits. I pretty much grain free at this point, but it wasn't even a goal when I started. I can tell if something I eat makes me feel yucky now, and it's easy to avoid it without feeling like I'm depriving myself.  \n\n\nIf/when I plateau or feel poorly I'll track and adapt. The beautiful thing is that I feel my energy and mental clarity getting to place where I'm capable of doing that.   \n\n\nFood is beyond secondary to living now. When I feel hunger- real hunger I'll eat something. There is no need to clean my plate, my body tells me when it is full.   \n\n\n I thought I'd never feel well again. I have hope now. I also am excited to see the changes that this diet can have for my kids. The brain and body need fat and protein.  \n\n\nI was so scared of eating fat. I always thought, \"I am fat, I can't eat fat! Everyone says how bad fat is!\" Don't let the fear hold you back. I know it is so hard to look at changing your diet when you have no energy and constant brain fog- you don't have to make it too complicated. You deserve to feel better.  \n\n\nThank you so much to everyone in this group who has taken time to share, and help others like me get their life back.",

And yeah, mainstream hates it because it works!\n\nI'm 5 years in, 90lbs down, and although I break keto when I travel, that's not often! I always come back because of how it feels.\n\nGlad you're part of our group and best of luck on your continued journey!",

I gained weight no matter what so at one point I said fuck it and stopped worrying. Then all the sudden I was big big. Keto took me down 190lbs in two to three years or so. Then I was happier and started to eat normal again. Slowly over like three years I ballooned back up to 280lbs. Que last week. I decide I\u2019m doing keto again. Here we are. Already loving that I\u2019m not hungry 24/7. I forgot how good it felt to eat this way. Good luck in your journey you\u2019re doing wonderful!!!",

I tried keto a few years ago and it worked really well- the most I remember feeling was tired. I never got the energy boost or other health benefits, but I did lose weight, and that made everything better. Unfortunately new job= new stress= stress eating= two years of bingeing on carbs, so here I am, starting over. \n\nI was diagnosed as prediabetic, and even though diabetes terrifies me, stress eating and just trying to make it from one day to the next felt necessary. I have the kind of job where I *cannot* be sick. \n\nI\u2019m really worried I won\u2019t make it though keto flu. Reading your post gave me the courage to keep going, even as my joints are aching, my head is killing me, my stomach is a mess and I keep alternating between chills and sweats.",

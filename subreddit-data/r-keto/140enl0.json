Add ice. Then take it to work. I don't add any sweeteners or cream, it does not taste like it should be allowed! Also, it does not feel like a forced \"healthy smoothie or shake\" instead I am getting a delicious iced coffee!",

It's good to make informed decisions, however.\n\nI second, third, or fourth Keto Chow. It really is delicious. Lately, I've taken to using Fairlife Vanilla or chocolate shakes as the mixer in addition to water. Really, really good. I love the Fairlife shakes, but they are protein only and don't have the additional nutritional content. Adding them to the keto chow ups the protein. I only add 1/4 or 1/3 cup.\n\nYou can make waffles/chaffles with the keto chow, too. That is so handy.",

I mix 1 scoop with 16 oz of Fairlife whole milk and that is an incredible meal replacement at 51g of protein and 14g of carbs, plus the very good vitamin and mineral profile of the milk itself. It tastes like a pure, delicious creamy milkshake and if you throw in 2 tbsp of raw organic cacao powder, you got yourself the best damn chocolate milk on the planet.",

They are constantly innovating and developing new flavors so there are always at least 25+ to choose from, and seasonal offerings as well. Go directly to their website for the best deals. Some of the top keto influencers on YouTube also offer links to the KetoChow website for 10% off, and if you find you can\u2019t live without it (like me), they have a 15% off subscription offer, and a 20% off SURPRISE subscription. I switch between regular and surprise to get the great deals. Before keto, I had issues with absorbing enough nutrients. Now I get what I need and more. They also have hundreds of recipes on their website that you can make if you get tired of drinking shakes.",

I use their vanilla ice cream flavored protein powder (sounds bad for you, but it's not) blended with peanut butter, almond milk, and crushed ice and it makes a great smoothie that is filling and excellent on a hot summer day!  You can also add some sugar free syrup if you wanted to, I do not. Don't waste your money on pre-made shakes, you get much more bang for your buck with the powder.  You can get a five-pound container of the Rule 1 for 46.99 on Amazon and they come in a variety of flavors. I limit myself to two protein shakes per week, usually on the weekends as lunch replacements when I'm busy.",

It makes a pretty good, non chalky shake but I don't love the flavor, it's too fake-sweet.   \n\nSomeone on here the other day suggested buying Ghirardelli Majestic premium cocoa powder and adding some to shakes rather than tolerating whatever flavor they have, or searching for the ultimate chocolate flavor that may not exist.  \n\nI did that, and it is so good.  So if you have a prehistoric can of Hershey's cocoa powder in your pantry, ditch that thing or save it for other uses, and get some good cocoa powder for your shakes.",

I had a sample of the isopure and it wasn't to bad either.  They also have collagen peptides that are highly rated but I haven't tried the Costco ones but the collagens I've tried are pretty tasteless but do have a chalky after feel but honestly it wasn't too bad in my coffee at least",

At one point in my life I was working full time with overtime and going to school full time, and I always ate real food, mostly made by me. Fine if people want to take shortcuts and eat processed food, but frankly, THAT'S the route that is unsustainable because people inevitably become miserable because what they are eating is not satisfying. Then they wonder why they're miserable and are hungry all the time and then they quit. Just sayin'.",

It's okay if what's working now doesn't work later and then adjusting when it comes time. It doesn't doom one to failure. People have great success with keto in many different ways. Try not to use yourself as a yard stick.",

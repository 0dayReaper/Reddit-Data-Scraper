Its just been much more depressing than my pizza and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s diet. And before the weight comes off, it feels like at times it isn\u2019t worth it. \n\nAnyone feel like sharing their overcome/success stories with the mental aspect of this diet change? I swear the lethargy right now just feels unsustainable. When can I expect a turnaround?",

            "comment": "The thing that really helped me was watching a lot of youtube videos/podcasts about how blood glucose and insulin affect not only our body but also our minds. It really clicked for me that being on the glucose rollercoaster was giving me anxiety, mood swings and at times even feelings of depression. It was such a feeling of relief to realise that it wasn't that I just couldn't cope with life but that I was experiencing an actual chemical reaction to what I was eating. \n\nI know we all say it over and over but electrolytes were essential and for me. Also at first I didn't bother even thinking about calories, I just wanted to get off the carbs and feel normal again. To be honest I still am kind of in that phase, I have lost about 20 pounds with 10 more to go and I am only now thinking about tracking my calories to ramp up the wieght loss. \n\nI really wanted to make this a lifestyle rather than an end goal so I refused to suffer or restrict myself. I definitely eat less than I used to but it kind of happened naturally because I am not on the constant prowl for carbs. I guess I have put food in its rightful place of a fuel source rather than an emotional crutch.\n\nOh And keto chocolate, my literal angel \ud83d\ude05\n\nGood luck to you, better days are ahead!!",

My main goal is weight loss, and I try not to weigh myself every single day because I know that as long as I do what I intend to, it will work out. Currently, I'm down 60+ lbs since March and just use that as motivation to fight through the basic keto food group cycle I've found myself in. I think the feeling of accomplishment is what I am enjoying about the process. I notice shirts fitting looser. The belt has to be tightened a bit more and it's just a good feeling overall.",

What did the trick for me was, I kicked off with a 36 hour fast, to get rid of all the carbs and water and then switched to Keto diet. I lost 10lbs during the 36 hour fast, so hat was a massive boost. I was in ketosis on day 3 and starting losing weight. I signed up for a service called Keto Cycle, comes with an app that allows you to plan your meals and calorie deficit. It has been a massive help for me, and the diversity of food you can eat is very motivating. I am losing 4lbs per week now. The only thing for me is that I never had the Keto flu. I adjusted without issues, but my body has always been strong in that regard. It is important to take electrolytes from day 1 and make sure you get enough fat and proteins. Oh and at least drink 3 liters of water per day. That is very important too. Good luck on your journey, hope you can ride it out and feel the true benefits of Keto.",

Though still working on perfecting making breaf since buykng it isnt cist efrective at all.\n\nFor ur ben and jerrys ice cream issue , whats ur fave flavor combo? i might have a suggedtion for a more keto fteindly sub since there are loads of ways to make really good keto ice cream . \n\nAs for ur pizza addiction, ive got 3 really good suggestions to try, some more clean keto than others.\n\nOne, use a low carb tortilla for ur crust. Bake in over for 5-10 min at 300 f. Put a couole tbsp sugar free crap ingredient free spaghetti sauce of ur choice. Add either sliced cheese or shredded of choice, meat or pepperoni and toppings of choice . Pop back in the oven for 10 min more. Uve got a nice singke serve pizza. Do a sude of salad or a crao ton of protien to make it a full satisfying meal.\n\nTwo, take a full package ground italian sausage. Doesnt matter if hot or mild. Mash into a pie pan to mold. Bake at 300 f for 30 min.\n\nTake out and drain off fat bit save for later. Its a very good cooking fat.\n\nAdd sauce, cheese, toppings of choice . Bake at 300 f until cheese melts.\n\nMakes 4 servings. I usually eat 2 for a full meal.\n\n\n3, Go look at the youtube channel calked keto twins. They recently did a 2 ingredient carnivore pizza crust video. It mostly uses egg whites whipped into a merangue. Use that for ur crust and add sauce, cheese, toppings of choice and uve got a soft crust pizza. \n\nThe italian sausage crust makes more of a deep dish pizza btw, or soft crust because its not very deep in shape.\n\nIm only giving these keyo sub options because u specifically mentioned those addictions/cravings. So i figured addressing those as a immediate cincern eas a good idea. And since pizza and ice crwam are some of my junk food addiction , well lets say ive akready addressed those a long time ago and tend ti have multiple sub options",

Figured it couldn't be worse than being miserable every day anyway. So I persevered. Everyone in my life supported me in my dietary journey, even if they don't totally understand. And now I do feel better, on average. I'm not cured or anything but I feel less fearful, less like the world is caving in on me. And I've also lost over 10 lbs, so that's a plus.",

I still think about them just because it\u2019s annoying as hell to find food without them, but that\u2019s been mildly alleviated by using keto chow meal replacement shakes to satisfy some level of sweet tooth and give more variety without all the effort",

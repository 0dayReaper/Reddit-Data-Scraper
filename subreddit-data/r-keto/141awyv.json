    "postText": "I love a can of yellowfin tuna in olive oil and salt as my lunch. Looking for some low mercury alternatives to yellowfin. I heard skipjack is a good one, but I cannot seem to find skipjack in olive oil with salt. I find the tuna in water unappealing and lower in fat content. I live in the USA, happy o shop on Amazon or some online shop. Within reason, I\u2019m not extremely price sensitive.\n\nAny suggestions?",

I had never had sardines before eating them and always in my mind apparently confused them with anchovies. However when I gave them a try they are great - slightly stronger than regular canned tuna in flavor but not absurdly so and can be substituted anywhere in lieu of tuna. What bones remain are not a 'bone' texture, they just sort of fade away and absolutely aren't hard enough/crunchy enough to notice, maybe like hair-thin strands of just before al-dente pasta if trying to determine if you could get past the thought enough to try. (EDIT - if you were to sprinkle flakes of salt on top or mix them with anything a la tuna salad, they are so inconspicuous you would not notice they were there)\n\nThe mercury content is amazingly low. (Knew I had it in an old comment so copying from there):\n\nYou could have at least 7 servings of sardines for every one serving of tuna, so you could have it every day for the same impact.\n\nBenefits - Low on the food chain so [environmentally better and] dramatically lower in mercury than the various tunas, https://www.fda.gov/food/metals-and-your-food/mercury-levels-commercial-fish-and-shellfish-1990-2012, going with median ppm Sardines are 0.010, canned light tuna is 0.077, skipjack tuna 0.15, albacore tuna 0.338 or 0.36, yellowfin tuna 0.311, \"all\" fresh/frozen tuna 0.34 or 0.334, bigeye tuna 0.56.",

I can have one can a week on our budget, it runs around 2.50 for a 5 ounce can though i got it for 2.30 a can when we went to costco last week. \n\nIt is not water packed or oil packed exactly, it is packed in its own oil. Just tuna and sea salt. \n\nHands down the best dang tuna ever other than catching it myself (which is mot happening these days with the price of party boats lol).",

Really found this subreddit by chance when I was trying to motivate myself, found a few amazing progress photos and the detailed information in FAQ sold me. \n\nSo bit of random info:\n\n**favorite breakfasts** cream cheese pancakes, eggs with spinach and bacon, omelets with ham, spinach and cheese, breakfast keto eggnog on ice, eggs poached in spicy bacon and tomato, anything in homemade hollandaise.\n\n**lunch** chicken thighs cooked in ghee with cheesy spinach, lettuce wraps with bacon and avocado, ceasar salad, deviled eggs with everything. \n\n**dinner** swedish meatballs in a beef juice and sour cream gravy. burgers in a lettuce wrap, wings in 1/2 butter and 1/2 franks hot sauce, ribeye with buttery mushrooms and spinach, cream cheese pancake made as massive dutch pancake with ham, bacon, cheese and spinach embedded inside. \n\n\nHaven't really fasted as I love to eat big meals 3 times a day. Macros have always been about 70% plus fat, deficit about 15-18%. Have a lovely weekend everyone. \n",

I personally like it in a belgian waffle iron (which has a broken latch, these puff up a lot and cook much better without the latch honestly.)  The waffles are awesome cold too, they taste like sponge cake, sometimes I make chocolate mousse and slather it on a cold keto waffle with some raspberries or blackberries...so damn good.  Also great with some peanut butter cream (use peanut butter powder and whip with cream, I don't think peanuts are great for you so I only do this every so often.)  Also awesome if you take the waffles, cut a hole and fry it up with an egg bird nest/egg in a frame style!  Make sure the yolk is nice and runny ;) ",

This batch makes about 4-5 belgian waffles.\nBlend until completely smooth.  Pour in waffle iron when the light says its hot.  I use a $25 belgian iron from amazon with the latch broken off.  I didn't do this on purpose but it works better because this batter puffs up and if you keep it latched down it starts squirting out the sides as it heats up instead of rising.  I also have a thin waffle maker and the thicker belgian comes out much better.  Cook until it just start to brown, it should still be fairly yellow, overcooking makes it loose it's custardy-ness.  Eat them hot with bacon and a fried egg on top or dip them in coffee.  Eat them cold for a quick breakfast or put whipped cream on top.  You can flavor the cream with cocoa or peanut powder or make chocolate whipped cream and dust with peanut powder and make a cream sandwich, holy shit it's like better than a peanut butter cup.\n",

I don't think I've found any recipes I really like with coconut flour, it really doesn't bake/cook as well as almond flour.  The cream cheese gives the pancakes/waffles more structure than if you don't use it.  I've made them without and it works fine just has more of a crepe-like texture, a little more custardy.  I like thinking of keto batter as more of a custard, the coconut does not lend itself to custard-ness.  Honestly you barely need any almond flour either, at least if you like things being more custardy which I do.\n",

Then add in bone broth/stock til the balls are nearly covered. Keep on a light simmer for about 20 mins. Add in the cream of choice (about 1/2-1 cup) and crack in some pepper. Going to try it over cauliflower puree this weekend. If you want a thicker sauce like ikea you will need to add a small amount of xan gum although I never have as I prefer the way I had them in Sweden. ",

I've had strep and colds and flu more times than I can even begin to count.\n\nI started eating paleo and it settled down a bit, but I was still getting sick multiple times per year. After several years I added keto (January last year) and I've been sick once, and it was just a cold for a few days. :D\n\nI used to be scrambling to try and figure out how to get a tonsillectomy covered under my formerly shitty health insurance because I was getting strep numerous times per year and I was SO DONE with it but I can't even remember the last time I had strep at this point.\n\nIt's amazing how sick I was, constantly, on the SAD diet and yet everyone was always telling me how HEALTHY I was eating. Now people give me crazy eyes that I'm downing the heavy whipping cream straight from the container (OMFG so gooooooood *drools*) and buy cheese in the multi-packs, they are convinced I'm going to kill myself, and yet here I am, healthier than I've ever been since I was a wee infant (if even that, I had pneumonia at age two!)

Started weighing monthly then. \n\nDo you drink mio? Do artificial sweeteners affect your progress? \n- I like sparkling water. Rarely have sweeteners aside from sf pancake syrup or the occasional quest bar.\n\nHow can I be awesome like you?\n-it's all about finding that eating plan that works for you. \n\n",

I struggled with so many \"diets\" thinking I am missing out on life because I wasn't taking a evening off, eating cake when offered at work, having a pint instead of a sparkling water/diet coke/red wine (keto friendly). In all honesty it was 255lbs that was making me miss out. I felt uncomfortable everywhere. I was out of breath with my baby daughter trying to carry her around. I wasn't going out, I buy biscuits or a cake just for me and my husband.. that was a treat. Now I enjoy my job so much more, travel all over with my new job that I had the confidence to apply for. I go out to the pub on weekends after a 1-2 hour walk around a new town. I enjoy feeling better about myself. \n\nIts hard at first to just say no to rewarding yourself with food but then you get to a point where you question why you were ever that way. ",

                            "comment": "I love how people just jump in with advice without knowing my situation.  Thanks internet psychic armchair obesity doctors! I have used mfp all three months, second time on keto in two years.   Thanks but no thanks for the unsolicited advice.  I have been trying to lose weight for ten years now with three different obesity doctor's help and no cheating on what they prescribe me, and this might just be the comment that pushes me over the goddamned edge today.  \n\nWhat I HAVE found with the help of my various doctors the last ten years is that it's looking like fifteen years of sleep apnea and chronic insomnia left untreated created metabolic changes in me that are going to be very hard to undo.  Insomniacs are notorious for not being able to lose weight and being deficient in magnesium, which yes, I supplement with.  \n\nCombined with 25 years of drinking diet coke multiple times a day, my metabolism is stuck.  Diet Coke is not a diet food at all, it is a big fat lie and some experiments showed me that my body processes aspartame like it does sugar, so chugging this crap has fucked my weight losing ability and actually PUT weight on me, especially around my middle.  I was not eating extra calories to replace the empty ones.  The articles I have read say if you are a chronic Diet Coke drinker like I was, you can exercise all you want and it won't make a difference- I have noticed that as well the past few years.  There was a time I was bike commuting 125 miles a week for two years and I never lost a lb!  I wasn't eating Big Macs to replace the lost calories, either.\n\nI drink tons of water, I supplement with potassium, my protein never goes much above twenty percent of my calories, and I don't use any artificial sweeteners, barely even use Stevia now.  Ketostix, as helpful or unhelpful as they are, almost always show a little pink on the stix.  I just don't lose weight for all my effort.  \n\nThree months of no sugar or wheat or goodies at Christmas and eating at a caloric deficit and not losing a lb makes me want to kill myself after ten years.  All this fat around my middle that I gained especially in the last three years during a very stressful period (a steady flood of stress hormones stall weight loss too and packs lbs around your middle, look it up) make life harder to live- it's uncomfortable to try to move around the world in a body this big, with hurting feet and knees from the newer lbs creeping on, and according to the research the docs and I have done together, fucking Diet Coke is making me fat over the years and I havn't even had the pleasure of the delicious foods most people eat to get fat making me fat!  It's like getting pregnant without ever having an orgasm.\n\nSo this isn't just the typical Keto plateau cry for help.  I've read those posts for two years now and have done everything they say, and I try to avoid commenting.  Because then I get all the typical advice I've already read.  Like hey, \"Use My Fitness Pal!  Maybe your calories are too high?\"  I didn't even ask for help on this post.  \n\nWhen my insurance starts back up again, I'll ask a doc, not reddit, for advice.  I only wrote this out because maybe someone else out there is beating their head against a wall over not losing weight, and has not considered the role proper sleep can play in your metabolism, or aspartame, or that cortisol flooding your brain from a stressful life can stall your efforts.  Thanks anyways?  \n\n",

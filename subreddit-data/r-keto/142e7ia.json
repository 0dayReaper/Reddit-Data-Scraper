    "postText": "I have been doing keto for 5 weeks and recently have been feeling very fatigued starting in the early evening. I upped my calories a bit, but I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m not getting enough salt or magnesium. I took some electrolytes yesterday and felt much better. Any thoughts on this? Does low magnesium cause fatigue? How about salt?",

            "comment": "\u201cWelcome to r/keto! It sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms associated with the so-called \"Keto Flu.\" Please be advised that Keto Flu can happen at any time but the good news is that it can be avoided with proper electrolyte management.\n\n\nAre you getting 5000mg sodium, 1000-3000mg potassium, and 500mg bioavailable magnesium daily?\n\n\nIf the answer is \"I don't know,\" start tracking that intake and supplementing. Electrolyte needs are different for everyone, but these are good guidelines to follow. More information can be found in the FAQ section [Adapting to a Low Carb Lifestyle](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#wiki_adapting_to_a_low_carb_lifestyle).\n\n\nr/keto is not a replacement for your doctor- please seek medical attention if you are concerned about anything you're experiencing.\n\n\nAs a reminder, please read our FAQ before posting.

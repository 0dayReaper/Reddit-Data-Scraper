    "postText": "This is the best damn dessert I have ever made/have, and its to die for, especially if you've been keto a long time and prefer mildly sweet things:\n\n1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream\n\n1/4 cup unsweetened Ghirardelli Majestic 100% cocoa powder (Guittard ok too)\n\n1/4 cup powdered allulose\n\n1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract\n\n1/4 tsp espresso powder\n\nBeat with hand mixer until stiff. Gradually work up from medium to high or it will splatter. Don't  beat on low bc it will take longer and turn into butter!\n\nChill and serve later.\n\n(Note: I tried posting this to r/ketobaking only to find they only allow trusted members to post. Their loss =your gain!)",

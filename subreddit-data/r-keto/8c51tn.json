I asked for a McDouble with bacon, no bun, no ketchup, and some lettuce. I thought they'd just throw some lettuce in there for me, and she asked if I wanted it lettuce wrapped. I was stoked!",

They'll lettuce wrap it nice and put it in a bowl for you! \n\nAlso available through skip the dishes and uber eats if I'm not mistaken. They have such good tasting burgers there too. Highly recommend it! ",

I can order the same thing, the same way at the same location and get it different every time.\n\nTwo double stacks, no ketchup, no bun, all in one container.  Extra banter from the confusion, clarifying yes no bun and no ketchup and sometimes extra veggies.\n\nOne day there's lots of ketchup.  The next day there's mayo and mustard on the side.  Next day they're both on it.  Next day there's no sauce at all.  Next day there's no cheese.  Next day there's ketchup, but no mayo or mustard.  Next day no veggies.  Next day it's cheese side down.\n\nIt's maddening, because I shouldn't have to specify I want everything that comes on it except the things I'm specifying to remove.  In the last few orders I think they gave me ketchup (the thing I asked not to have) twice and mayo and mustard only once.\n\nOrdering sausage patties, round eggs and cheese at McD's a la carte (was cheaper than minus bun) is a game of what imaginative ways are they going to assemble today.\n\nIn a breakfast meal container, all there, cheese on top.  In a big mac box.  Three big mac boxes, one for each ingredient (yes, cheese in its own box).  Cheese on the bottom so it melts to container.  In a salad bowl on top of lettuce.  All those are acceptable, it's just funny to watch how many different ways the same order comes out.\n\nI'd specify more, but I'm afraid it's just going to confuse them more.  Minus two things and all in one container should be enough.\n\n",

It's a common tactic and you just don't know who you are dealing with until it happens. Suddenly your automatic scripting is interrupted and you have to think \"Is this person trying to scam me or do they just want not want coins?\". This immediately turns your brain off and suddenly simple and easy things become ten times harder to do as you get more and more flustered. You can't really survive being fake friendly and doing an extremely monotonous task if your brain is always on. I had a couple friends who never had this problem; but they usually didn't need to work there and didn't hate their job.",

I\u2019ve been tracking the past week and for some reason I cannot get above 1200 calories. I would comfortably like to be around 1400 a day, as this is still a deficit to me. \nI\u2019m doing \u201cclean keto\u201d so no dairy or eggs (this is for health reasons as both are inflammatory to me) and I\u2019m finding it extremely hard to get my calories up. Is it okay to eat 1-2 large avocados a day? Idk what else I can eat that is nutrient dense aside from peanut butter. Any suggestions?",

You can indicate which foods you like and don't like, what weight you are, your goal weight, and they will spit out a meal plan with a calorie deficit and macronutrients balance. You can customise the selection of meals at will or create your own. It will keep track of whatever you log for the day and show you if you are hitting your calorie and nutrient goals. It is a paid service, but if you lose 5kg in the first 30 days of signing up, you get your money back. I was sceptical at first, but it has been very good to be honest. I never ate this much vegetables and fruit each day, including all \"evil\" fatty foods like cream and cheese, butter, avocado, etc. If you decide to use the service, just sign up for the app, ignore all the other stuff they are trying to sell. Their support has also been quick in answering questions. So overall I can recommend this service. I know I sound like a salesman or a shill, but hand on my heart, I am genuinely not.",

    "postText": "I've posted on here before about my progress, but I'll retread my history and context. I've grown up big. I've been a fat guy my whole life. I've dealt with it, been depressed about it, and cried about it. I'm a 29 year old man, and I've cried because of being fat. I've tried to lose weight many times in the past, unsuccessfully. I went to the hospital last May, and I wasn't really weighing myself because I knew the grim reality. Mentally, I had accepted I was huge and I'd probably be dead before I reached 60 as my family's genes are known for heart issues. The nurse told me I had **weighed 350 lbs**. *Yikes.* As the summer went on, I realized how lonely I was. I saw someone I looked up to lose some weight and it really inspired me to TRY to lose weight (shouts out to Rocco from Mega64 for that one). I tried to get out more but I just was never happy. And then I started to exercise a little and saw no change. Then WoW Classic came out and I wasn't leaving my room and eating Zebra Cakes all day. I was watching a streamer who began to talk about their experience with weight loss and they truly motivated me to get to work and change my damn life around (shouts out to GreekGodX). \n\nSo on Sept 2nd, 2019, I got rid of the Zebra Cakes. I dumped out the carb-filled drinks. I began anew. I had some bumps in the road to start, and realized I was eating WAY more strict than I had to, counting TOTAL CARBS instead of net carbs. But the ball was rolling. I learned a lot and lost quite a bit in a small amount of time. My coworkers were constantly telling me I had looked great. But I wasn't seeing it myself. I don't know what it is about the human brain, but I can't see it when I look in a mirror. It's like a phantom that haunts me, I can't unsee myself as huge. I was wearing 4XL shirts and now I'm wearing a XL shirt. From size 52 waist jeans to 40 waist jeans. But I can't see it still. I have a jawline now. But unless I see a photo side by side, it's almost like it doesn't matter. It's the worst feeling. But I know I'm succeeding. **I now weigh 250 lbs.** I have been stagnant for about four weeks total now, despite meeting my macros. But, that comes with the territory. I'm still very pleased with my progress. I can RUN again. I go for jogs sometimes now! \n\n---\n\nProgress Photos:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ExUZmpU.jpg\n\n\nOn the left, was May 2019 at 350 lbs. On the right, was March 2020 at around 270 lbs. I currently don't have a better one at 250 lbs, but this was one of the first photos where I truly saw change, so I'm sticking with it here. Coronaszn has made it so I haven't really had much interaction with others, so no opportunities to take a photo! \n\nFor anyone thinking about starting keto, do it. I loved pizza more than anything, but fat head dough and chicken crust pizza have been saviors. There are so many delicious things (and I don't even mean just vegetables, despite loving asparagus now) you can have! 250 lbs, or 100 pounds lost, in 12 months was my original goal but here I am 3 months ahead of schedule. Now I'm aiming for 200 lbs by January. I hope to make it! \n\nI've had two really eye opening, revealing moments that got me emotional: \n\n1. I take an annual photo at a gaming convention with my friends, and with a group I follow online. These were my first \"comparison\" photos to last year. It wasn't until I saw these photos side by side with last year's photos that I could see a drastic change. I told my friends how incredible it felt to me, but I don't know that it was understood. People may think I'm exaggerating when I say I can't see the difference, but when I saw the photo...I had such joy I cried in the bathroom for a bit. I felt so accomplished finally...\n\n2. I've been wearing 4XL shirts forever. They've gotten really loose on me so I started wearing my 3XL shirts from back in the day...and then I bought a single 2XL shirt and it fit pretty well. That felt nice! And then, there was this T-Shirt I REALLY wanted, but was only available in an XL size. I took a chance, thinking, at least maybe in 6 more months it would fit. It arrived, and damn it, it fit well. It's a little SNUG but it FITS. I haven't worn an XL ANYTHING since I was in 6th grade. This felt AMAZING. But now it's time to start replacing my wardrobe and make my pockets hurt. \n\nI hope if nothing else, perhaps someone can get some inspiration or motivation from this. Keto will help. And I feel like it's saved my life.",

Still, pictures were just a source of misery for me. I spent YEARS avoiding the camera at all costs.\n\nLast October at a halloween carnival I wore a new XL t-shirt that I treated myself to (fusion of Monty Python and Holy Grail), a pair of skinny jeans (ME???? In Skinny Jeans...and LIKING it? Get TF out of here!), and a pair of regular width Vans (Hawaiian Yoda theme). Looking back at my loss spreadsheet I would have been 265 - down 80lb from 345 in about 4.5 months.\n\nI had a couple epiphanies that night:\n\n1: I felt...normal. I no longer felt like the FATTEST person in the room.\n\n2: I felt good about myself. I hadn't worn cool or trendy clothes in a LOOOOONNNNNG time. As a 4XL, I tried to be as neutral as possible. Colors - HELL no!\n\n3: There was a picture taken of me with my family. I felt good taking the photo, but dreaded looking at it because I just knew I'd look like an absurd fatty. Then afterwards I sucked it up and looked at the photo. I looked pretty darn good! For the first time in pretty much forever I saw a picture of myself and didn't feel like I was looking at an imposter (I've always felt like a normal sized person trapped in a big persons body - like reverse dismorphia). I looked at that picture ALOT. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've lost 110lbs so far and now I can't wait to look at photos taken of me. Being happy to be photographed is a HUGE NSV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo back to you - You keep on keepin on brother. It only gets better as you keep going!",

It\u2019s posts like this that inspire me to do my best. \n\nCan you share your daily routine (macros and exercise) when you started at 350 and how you progressively adjusted that routine now that you are at 250? \n\nThanks again! You rock! Keep on keeping on!",

When I started back in September, *I would limit myself to 2000 calories a day, 20g of carbs a day, 150g of Fat, and get as much protein as I could making sure I got at least 120g or close to it*. I'd drink at least 120 fl oz of water a day. For exercise, I wasn't doing anything really, BUT my job required me to walk around a lot so I'd typically get *10,000 steps in on 4 of the 7 days in the week*. I introduced Intermittent Fasting into my routines around November, where I'd allow myself to eat between 10 AM and 7 PM. \n\nThose numbers changed a lot over the nine months, but that was where I started! I didn't adjust my macros until I reached 300 lbs, and at that point I used the keto calculator featured in the FAQ (https://calculo.io/keto-calculator) to recalculate for 300 pounds. And then I did it again at 275, and now again at 250. \n\nIn terms of exercise, as I said I didn't really do much at first. 10,000 steps on 4 of the 7 days of the week do to my job. However, since January I've been going for daily walks on my days off from work, and I've even started to run now and then. I'm not calling myself a jogger, but I've jogged down my street! It felt dope. I've also implemented DDPYoga into my days when I have multiple days off in a row, as I don't want to stay stagnant.",

I've not only experienced it myself (28F, lost 150lbs total, went from 354 to 203 in spurts over a few years, and now gained 65 back, so only 85lbs net loss), but it's been documented for many other weight loss patients as well. Most of what's written in research articles and blogs has focused on women and bariatric surgery patients, but the general idea is that your brain is still operating on the old ways of perceiving itself up to a few years after the weight loss, and with time it can pass. If it gets in the way of your confidence or relationships, though, it's totally valid to seek counseling for it :)",

Congratulations!   \nAlso a wow player, although not classic... and I have often found myself sitting for way too long playing without realising how much time has passed, usually snacking ofc.   \n\n\nI am just at the start of this attempt to lose weight/get healthy having slipped off track several times in the past (emotional eating) Feeling pretty confident about things this time though tbh, and seeing success stories like yours definitely help the motivation!",

It's amazing how we can't see ourselves how others see us sometimes. \n\nI have a suggestion for exercise - get a bike and start building up distance. I've been riding for a year now and am able to burn 1000 calories per ride (25 miles) with no beating on my knees and joints. You might have to start at a mile or two at first but it's worth it. I did the running thing for a couple of years but I hated it",

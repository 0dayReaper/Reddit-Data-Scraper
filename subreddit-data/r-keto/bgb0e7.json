I\u2019ve had so many challenges and stalls in my weight loss journey thus far but I have overcome so many of those obstacles &amp;amp; I\u2019m proud. But I want anyone out there that is struggling with weight loss to know they can do it too.

That\u2019s what did it for me! If you haven\u2019t watched it, go watch The Magic Pill on Netflix. It changed my life! You are absolutely NOT a failure until you let some disease like diabetes or heart failure kill you! You can stop it and change it before it even gets to you though. Looking better will be a welcomed side effect. Feeling better is everything!! I believe in you and your will to do it. Depression is an ugly beast that pulls us all in and chews us slowly sometime in our life. I\u2019ve been there, hell I fight it every day. That\u2019s how I know you can too! Sometimes the only way out of the fire is through. I KNOW you\u2019ve got this you just have to see it!",

I think all depends on where you carry your weight mine was mostly upper half so loose skin on my thighs isn\u2019t a huge problem. It\u2019s a little loose on the inside thighs more than anything. But I suggest weight lifting throughout. You don\u2019t have to go crazy but just maintaining tone would help.",

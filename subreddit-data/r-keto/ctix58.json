    "postText": "I have been doing Keto and lifting weights for about two months. I lost about 30 pounds (50 overall) in those two months (SW:270 KSW: 252 CW: 222). It\u2019s all been a really great experience. One experience stands out from the rest though. \n\nMy wife and I were arguing. It was my fault and I was just letting her vent (if you make a mistake you have to take the punishment). She was really passionate about what she was talking about. I was standing there shirtless and in the middle of her talking I crossed my arms across my chest. She immediately got red, a little flustered and kind of just stopped talking.  I asked her what was wrong? She said \u201cyou can\u2019t just stand there shirtless with your chest and big arms, I can\u2019t concentrate on being mad at you.\u201d  \n\nI have never felt so good about myself as I did in that moment. My wife thought I was hot to the point of getting flustered. What an amazing feeling.\n\nTLDR: I have been working out and doing Keto. My wife was \u201cyelling\u201d at me, I crossed my arms across my chest and she got flustered, saying I can\u2019t do that because she can\u2019t concentrate on being mad at me.",

He suggested that we would have better relations when we lost weight.  THAT WAS THE BEST REASON EVER for us.  That was our motivator.  He dropped from approx 465 to around 230 and I dropped from approx 295 to around 180.  And now we have healthy lives and healthy relations.  Kudos OP - that\u2019s definitely a win!!!",

Depressed people who feel they have no value generally don\u2019t find the will power to make positive improvements.\n\nFat people know they\u2019re fat and that it\u2019s not healthy.  People who shame them and try to \u201ceducate\u201d them about their fatness as if they\u2019re not already well aware are just obnoxious concern trolls imo.",

I was well aware that I was I was HUGE and didn't need to be preach at.     \n\nThe second side of the coin is that I should not of allowed myself to get into that position.  I \"gave\" people permission via my size.   The fat is beautiful is not a motivator for change.  Frankly, it is a justification for being fat.           \n\nThe fat is beautiful movement is nice mental masturbation.  It's wrong because it allows people to rationalize things in their minds even if it's not true.         \n\nUnderstand, I was the \"jolly fat man\" for about 25 years.  Call me fat, and I can cut you down to the quick.  Even today, I can cut you down to the quick.  The difference is that now when someone calls me fat, it fires me up to get smaller.  It fuels my fire.  I am not beautiful.  I am just a sexy bitch :)       \n\nWe must stop giving people excuses to be unhealthy.  We must put personal responsibility back on the person.  I am not advocating treating fat people like shit.  That is plain stupid.  I am saying that we must address the lack of discipline that allows them to get fat.  I can give you 10 very damn good reasons for why I got up to the luxurious weight of 593 pounds.  Hell, you would probably agree with at least half of those reasons.  But the fact of the matter is that I was eating myself to death.  I was not beautiful but I was damn near bedridden.          \n\nNo matter the reasons, they were not reasons to justify where I got to in life.  Ultimately, the reason I got so big is because I chose to keep shoveling food down my throat.  No different than the person who says, \"I cannot give up bread\" as they gobble french toast.  They don't realize they are saying that bread is more important to them than being healthy.          \n\nIf I sound like I disagree with what you wrote, I don't.  I am really just remembering my situation.  Remembering how hopeless I felt.  Remembering how pathetic I was.  Being fat is not beautiful.  It's a shitty life.     \n\nI would not wish that on anyone.",

He keeps on saying he wants my help, though what I\u2019ve realised recently is that him saying that is really him saying he wishes I could lose the weight for him and he doesn\u2019t want to put in the time and effort to do it himself. He has bad eating habits that he learned from his family and I can\u2019t fix those for him. Plus, that\u2019s not my place as his wife; that\u2019s up to him. Every time he seems to rediscover motivation and self-control, it\u2019s always gone in less than a week. I\u2019m sure he could do it if he wanted it badly enough, but even after some minor health scares (that won\u2019t be so minor if he keeps down the road he\u2019s on), he\u2019s still not internally motivated. He doesn\u2019t want it badly enough and after 10 years with him, I\u2019m beginning to wonder if he ever will. I haven\u2019t given up hope on him fully, but if I were a betting woman, I wouldn\u2019t put money on him changing his ways anytime soon. I share so many of the inspiring stories from this subreddit with him, and he says that encourages him, but apparently not enough for him to actually enact lasting change in his life.",

She sees these things as negatives and wonders how I can love her/be attracted to her with stretch marks and a c-section scar. I see those things as physical manifestations of her love for me and my son and there is nothing more beautiful than sacrificing herself for the love of her family. I will always think she is the most beautiful person and I will always be attracted to her.

The last one I married because she wanted to get away from home. It never dawned on me that any woman would ever consider marrying me. After two years I realized it was a mistake. Happily there were no children involved. Got a job at a federal agency with GI preference. Moved to my home state and started to work. My cousin lived nearby in a mobile home and was having a party one weekend. She called me and asked to borrow $20. I walked into the loud party, handed her the money and walked out. The next week, when she repaid me, I asked her about a woman I saw across the room. Turned out to be her boss at work. I asked my cousin to see if the young woman would be willing to go out with me to a drive in movie. Three months later we were married. That was 37 years ago this Dec. I have a grown son and daughter. The point is, don't give up, you never know when or where you can discover the one for you. But you matter and you have worth regardless because you are you.

There were times when I would just sit and cry. But I had to go through those tough times. I needed to be kicked in the teeth to be in a place to fall in love with my wife. If only someone or something would have told me that I was going to go through all this stuff but at the end I would meet my future wife, it would have been so much easier to bear. But I didn\u2019t have that. I kept grinding anyway and never gave up. I reached out to friends, family, pastors, and even a therapist. I never gave up. I have been with my wife for almost ten years and we have a 1 year old son. Life is good right now. But it wasn\u2019t always like this, but I never gave up and kept on grinding. \n\nDon\u2019t give up and don\u2019t despair. You are just finding the type of guy that isn\u2019t for you. There are a bunch of flavors of guys out there, keep \u201ctasting\u201d until you find your flavor. The good news is you are that much closer to meeting mr. right because you have already eliminated some guys as mr. wrong.",

It's slowly working, and I'm lifting hard as well. It's kind of disheartening though, for some reason I have more subcutaneous fat than visceral fat for a guy which makes me look fatter than I really am for my weight. I see other guys my height and weight and they look a lot better. And I don't think I have less muscle, as my lifting numbers are pretty good for a beginner lifter. But eventually I'll get to my goal and look nice.",

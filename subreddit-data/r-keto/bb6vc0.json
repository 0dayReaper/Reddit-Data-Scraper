    "postText": "[https://i.imgur.com/FcPXHAv.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/FcPXHAv.jpg)\n\nHello! I updated the flawed previous image!Sadly, as i am not a graphic designer in any shape or form, i could not foresee the many problems i encountered. This lead to the final image being a bit hard to read, but oh well. I sank 15 hours into it, and redoing everything would take the same amount so, this is it for now.\n\nI like to believe that i took the advice from the previous thread and fixed the problems that it had. It became a more informational and more correct image, but then again i am repeating myself, it became hard on the eyes and a bit complex. Also, with the introduction of categories, the text became harder to read (yet still readable on modern displays). During the making of this, i noticed that the site i used for the nutritional information probably isn't the best choice, but i hope and believe that it is close enough for it to not matter.\n\nAnyways, its resolution is 12,000 x 7,000 so zooming shouldn't be a problem. I will provide a link to the full image (40mb) in the comments as posts get tagged as \"spam\" if they have more than 1 link in them.\n\nI hope that you like it and find it useful despite its flaws!\n\nEdit : :OOOOOO I forgot to rearrange the chinese cabbage. Since there are like 3 different types, i summed them up between raw and cooked and i got a new value. Then i forgot to move it and now the carbs go from 2,1 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2,7 . Ooft.\n\nEdit 2 : The grams of carbs are \\*net carbs\\*.Edit 3 : I should've added a flame symbol next to the meat category + possibly consider making a version with grams of protein/fat instead of %.Also, obligatory thank you for the silver and gold. Not really sure what they do but hey! Thanks again!\n\nEdit 4 : This is not an \"eat only these\" guide. Its purpose is to cover the basics. I might have missed a thing or two but i will never be able to fit every food in it. You can always check the nutritional values of items you like but are not in this image.\n\nAlso, the values are not per serving size, they are per 100 grams across all items. Yes, for example, you arent supposed to eat 100g of nuts, but you can always calculate from the numbers i have provided. 100 grams are 0.220lbs.\n\nEdit 5: Thank you to all for the kind words! I try and respond to the more interactive comments but upvoting really isnt enogh for the people who are thankful. Thanks to you for taking the time to check this out and write me a comment! Cheers!  \n\n\nEdit 6 : The eggs' values for protein and fats % are reversed. There is a possibility that there are 1-2 more items that have the same issue. It is not a gigantic problem, but i will fix them and post an updated picture with other small tweaks needed to be done. Sorry for the inconvenience!",

In the image, i have listed the values for 100gr. and 13g of carbs for a 10 minute snack is a lot. I put the \"warning\" sign as it was above 10g ( i don't know why i chose exactly 10g ).",

Cheese definitely has carbs - it's just a low amount that is lost in rounding depending on the serving size and how you slice it.  It probably won't be enough to mess with your diet unless you eat a lot.\n\nMany types of cheese have ~2.2g of carbs per 100g (this includes whole milk mozzarella, provolone, gouda, blue cheese.) Cheddar has less, ~1.3g, monterey jack has 0.7g. Other cheeses (parmesan, american, swiss) have 4-5 grams.",

    "postText": "Since January, I weighed 200 lbs at 6'0. Everyone at uni and work noticed me gaining weight, and it was so embarrassing. The most embarrassing moment was when one of my female co-workers told me that she used to have a crush on me when I started  working there a year ago at 18 when I was \"slim &amp; cute\", but now since I gained weight, she lost feelings for me. So I tried the keto diet, but working at fast food.. I broke it so many times since January. However, I started talking to this girl from U of T who I really had a huge crush on immediately. I was so excited to meet her in 3 months back in late May. I told her I was out of Canada and had to post pone until August. This gave me enough time to lose some weight, so I was determined to go back to my old weight of 170 lbs by the time I met her. I used her as motivation for weight loss &amp; I decided to stick with the diet and fight the temptation of eating sugar/carbs. I was losing weight for her, and not entirely my self. Unfortunately things don't always turn out the way you want them to in life. I was supposed to meet her last week, but she stopped replying after she met someone else. This was heartbreaking, but the weight loss is what cheers me up a bit.",

This is 100% the person that I'm meant to be with, who is always kind and supportive of me even when I'm not kind to myself. \nThis is the type of relationship I hope you find. So sorry someone brushed you off because of your weight. They showed their true colours.  \nSo happy that you have found success with keto this time round. \nThere's a book called 'The Kindness Method' that may be helpful, it's about just trying to do better next time rather than self sabotage with negative talk. You may not need it now you've found what clicks for you, but it could help someone else here. \nAll the best and awesome work!",

My little brother has been helping keep us solid (he's been keto since January, for enlistment reasons, and has had the ups and downs), but it's still disheartening every time I have a good ramen meal, but feel like shit bc carbs. But I have an anniversary vacay in October, and I'm determined to lose (hopefully) at least 20lbs by then. I want to feel good and feel like I look good next to my wife when we go out together.   \n\n\nKeep up the plan.

I remember that age (I'm only 29 now) when the only thing that mattered was attention from girls. I urge you however to alter your mindset a bit, and focus on becoming who you want to be, not what girls will find attractive. Worst thing to do is become someone you're unhappy with, have someone fall for you, and then have to keep being someone you don't want to be because you've found love. \n\nMy wife found me just as attractive at 200 lbs (I'm 6ft also) as she did at 290 lbs.

It's great that you got some motivation to actually stick it out and get over that first hump, 30 pounds is nothing to scoff at. Keep it up!! You got this.\n\nEdit: scrolling through the comments, wow, people really cannot stand women being honest, can they? \"Garbage person\", \"violent\", \"passing judgment\" and all sorts of derision for her opinion of his weight gain. Look - to sit and watch someone pack on 30 pounds is usually unattractive to people because it indicates a person who does not value themselves, and often when you gain that kind of weight, you may also change your personality/how you interact with people. But even then - she's entitled to her preferences and her attractions, no matter how shallow or superficial people here think it to be. Some people just are not attracted to brunettes. Oh well. Be blonde and love yourself anyway.\n\nI didn't see anywhere in OP's post that she called him a fat pig, or pointed and laughed, or otherwise made him feel like shit. THAT would be cruel and uncalled for. She gave him her honest opinion, probably upon being asked. And honest opinions, if given nicely, may be seen as superficial but they are hers to have. I might love and adore a 400 pound man but I'm not dating him as long as he makes it clear through his body and eating habits that he hates himself. And that 400 pound dude doesn't have to give a shit what I think.\n\nHence why OP - and the rest of us - should make changes in our lives for ourselves, even if they are motivated by loved ones (and especially if our coping mechanisms in life affect them).",

On behalf of females, I apologize.\n\nHaving said that, excuse and forgive me but, bitch who told you she had a crush on you was superficial so ignore her - even if she starts noticing you in that way again since you lost weight.\n\nAs for the ghosting crush... Use it as a \"mirror motivation\" for lack of a term. You stuck to this diet because you wanted to look good for her. But now you can do it to look and feel good about yourself! You have gone a long way to get where you are. Keep going at it! Congratulations on such a big progress! You just proved to yourself that you can do this, you just had someone as inspiration. You are your inspiration now! You can do it! Stay strong and keep going!",

That\u2019s awesome that you finally saw some progress.\n\nAll those failed attempts led to your eventual success, and you have strengthened your willpower and mind in that endavour.\n\nI do have a bit of important info for you though: there is  nothing magical about the keto diet. It is simply a creative way to reduce calorie intake. That being said, it works wonders for some people. But the whole point is that it is a sustainable, simple way to lose weight that some people find relatively easy compared to more conventional diet methods.\n\nThe fact that you failed this diet so many times indicates to me that maybe keto is not for you. It\u2019s great that you managed to push through and lose so much weight from it, but I suspect you may have way more success on a more flexible sort of diet.\n\nMaybe try more of an IIFYM diet (calories in calories out) and see if that is more comfortable/easier to sustain for you! Generally people prefer one or the other, so if you havent tried to before I highly reccomend you giving it a shot!\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to DM",

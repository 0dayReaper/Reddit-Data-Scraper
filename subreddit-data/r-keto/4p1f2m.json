    "postText": "So I've never been able to wear a tool belt at work (I'm an electrician). My boss has told me numerous times that if I got one, I'd get a raise. I told him I would eventually... 3.5 years ago. I've always been way too big to wear one.\n\nWell today's the day. I found a tool belt at home depot that actually fit me.\n\n[Before and After](http://imgur.com/a/56xfX)\n\nEdit: Wow, thanks to whoever gave me gold. This is amazing, and very motivational. You're too kind.\n\nEdit 2: Shit guys, another gold. The amount of support you guys are showing me is amazing. I've never had this kind of support in my life. A genuine thank you.\n\nEdit 3: Another little story brought up from the comments. I like weird shirts. My daughter loves them. Since most of my shirts are starting to fit like bedsheets on me, I decided to purchase new shirts 2 sizes smaller as something to work toward. They came in the mail Saturday afternoon, [and the shirts fit me perfectly](http://imgur.com/n3nGiJN). \n\nEdit 4: Another gold. This community really warms my heart. Thank you, stranger. Thank you all for your kind words. ",

If so, it truly shows. \n\nDid you also become more goofy (from your photos that I love) become more often when you started to lose the weight?\n\nI've noticed that I'm much happier a thinner me. I'm goofy, my SO and I play more childish games (play tag), and so on. \n\nNot a question, a statement: from your photos, you seem very happy with yourself. Very confident. That is sexy in everyone.

I\u2019m so proud of myself, no cheat days or accidents. \n\nSo I\u2019ve been pretty much avoiding any kind of fast food because I\u2019ve learned that carbs are hidden in things you\u2019d never think they would be. I\u2019m still mad about hotdogs and frozen meatballs. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m going on a three day trip soon and my hotel will not have any kind of cooking available, not even a microwave. just a mini fridge. I planned on packing some hams and cheese to snack on that I can keep in the mini fridge. But I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to rely on fast food for those days. \n\nThe specific places around my hotel are chipotle, Wendy\u2019s, McDonald\u2019s, subway. So your basics. What if any can you order from these places that\u2019s keto safe. \n\nI try to keep it less than 10 carbs per meal. Thanks!",

This supposedly comes out to around 1 gram net carbs. \n\nAnother option for McDonald's breakfast that might be cheaper is that they will let you order the sausage patties and round or scrambled eggs (aka \"folded eggs\") A La Carte, so you aren't paying for the biscuit that you don't get. I don't remember the exact price, but I've ordered four sausage patties and four round eggs before when i was hungry for more than just a biscuit-less biscuit. The online info says the sausage patty is 0.6 carbs, the round eggs are 0 carbs, and the folded eggs say anywhere from 0.5 to 2 carbs (not sure why these vary so much, maybe they mix in milk?)",

So go for the burgers, chicken, fish, etc. (without the bun of course). Keep sauce like ketchup or \"special sauce\" off the food as it may have sugars. Stick with mustard, ranch, blue cheese, oil, and vinegar. When I started, I ate fast food at least once a day, and I had great progress just getting the proteins and lettuce without sauce. The other thing to be mindful of is tomatoes, because the carb grams can count up fast.\n\nIt is actually fun going on a road trip and not have to starve!

When traveling for work I grew so sick of these two that I can\u2019t go back.\n\nTaco Bell: chicken power bowl, add beef, no beans or rice. Skip the sour cream and sauce if you\u2019re really cutting calories.\n\nKFC, Popeyes, etc: dark meat chicken pull the fried batter off. 100% of the protein, 90% of the flavor, almost no carbs, good calorie:protein:dollar ratio.\n\nRoom: Jalepeno Smoked Sausages with Mustard and/or low carb ketchup. Atleast it\u2019s a different flavor and not cold cuts.  Charcuterie sorta thing.  \n\nAlso, Sometimes there is a microwave in the common area of the hotel.",

Bread includes cookies/crackers.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Remember: keto = high-fat, moderate protein, no carbs.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**McDonalds:** you can order any of the burgers, just without the buns. When you remove the buns, each of the McDonalds burgers has a 50-50% protein/fat ratio, sometimes slightly higher fat. Ex: Big Mac sandwich without the bun = 350 calories (26g of fat, 18g of protein)\n\n**Order:** extra mayo (McChicken sauce) if you want more flavour.\n\n**Avoid:** fries/buns/hash browns\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Wendy's:** Same as above. Just order the burgers without the buns.\n\n**Order:** extra sour cream on the side if you want more flavour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chipotle:** pretty much anything from here is ok as long as you avoid the rice &amp; tortilla wraps. I'd suggest ordering a bowl:\n\na) your favorite protein:\n\nb) low-carb veggies (Ex: peppers, lettuce, onions)\n\nc) as much guacamole as you want (remember it's made from avocados which are the best fruit for keto)\n\nd) choose your dressings wisely (some are carb-based, some are fat-based)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ham/cheese is a good idea.\n\nAlso look into Quest bars or other \"keto\" friendly snack bars.\n\nAlso all nuts are good (as long as you're not allergic).\n\nGood luck &amp; DM me if you have more questions.",

I haven't looked at their website for a while, but their nutritional info is there, and it's also supposed to be publicly available inside every store (you may have to ask, but they do have it).  They do salads of course, but as I recall the dressings were unsuitably high in sugar.",

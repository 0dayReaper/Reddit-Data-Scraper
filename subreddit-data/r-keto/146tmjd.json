    "postText": "Was on keto for 4-5 years, lost 70 pounds and maintained it.  My son is now 2 and eating pretty much the same food as us, and I just stopped doing keto. Making two different meals all together is pretty much impossible with work/daycare/time. I know there's a lot of useless Keto bashing around (my doc still thinks i'm doing wrong), but I still strongly believe that developping brains need a lot of carbs. \n\nGaining weight slowly :/... Any tips?",

Then I add whatever carb makes sense for my family, or just make a family meal, then substitute or skip the carb for me. It doesn't always work, and sometimes I just eat leftover turkey breast and some vegetables, while my family eats spaghetti.\n\nExamples\nI'll make chicken, I'll separate my portion and chop their's up and add to noodles or rice \nThey have hamburgers, I'll have a bunless burger.\nTacos/nachos, I have a burrito bowl.\nWe like to make our own pizza, I use a keto tortilla as the \"crust\"\n\nI won't lie, it is hard to smell some of my old favorite foods, and resist. But I remind myself of the mental benefits and weight loss after struggling with my weight for so long",

I too believe a well rounded diet including carbs is best for kiddos.\n\nAs for meals, I make the exact same foods I always made. Pasta and meatballs? I skip the pasta and eat more salad. Burgers? No bun please. Steak and baked potatoes? I make extra veggies for myself. Sunday roast? Mashed cauliflower instead of mashed potatoes for me. It\u2019s honestly super easy to do. Even pizza night is fine, I just order dry rub wings and indulge in the few extra calories.

Then I\u2019m only ever really cooking for my toddler and everyone else (including me) is just assembling food.\n\nFor toddler I try to switch up the whole grains and I mostly make a pizza for him every day from scratch which I know sounds insane but literally takes 12 total minutes of mostly baking/inactive time.  Toddler eats the entire thing, veggies included every night so it is a win.  Let me know if you want the quick recipe, I actually enjoy doing this every night even after my work day, run/lift, and the insanity of being a toddler parent.",

A few grams will work.\n\nAnyway, I think it is kind of complicated to put kids on keto (if their health is not already complicated). Plus, their active bodies will burn the carbs better. Most young kids are running even if they are only going 30 feet. Still they should not be on very high carbs. Weight gain is a sign of having too much (or maybe insulin resistance), especially if they already had their pre-teen growth spurt. But can they do keto, yes... but maybe it complicates things for them. It's not totally necessary for all kids. Going a day or two without carbs weekly, could probably fix insulin resistance for most kids (assuming their blood sugars do not go up to 300 for the rest of the week).\n\nEdit:\n\nThere are some carnivores whose kids do great on meat and fat 99%. But those kids may want the diet for different reasons, or they just have not had opportunity to get hooked on processed foods or junk foods.",

The thing is, if u dont u make it where the carb sub isnt noticeable ad keto so u dont have to alter, or u do it where tge carbs are seperatly cooked then topped.\n\nExamples of keto kid fteindlt family meals.\n\nHot dogs/burgers. I recently foubd keto hot dog buns. I eat one hot dog with a keto bun, add shredded cheese and micriwavr the bun with cjeese to mt while i heat the dog on stove. \n\nU can use those keto buns foe the kid with say home made air fryer veggie chips, add kimchi or saurkraut to ur hot dog, sigar free keychup to kiddos. Throw in extra meat as a side for satiety since the hot dog is mlre fat than protien. Even a couole boiked eggs woukd do.\n\nWith burger , add alvacado, air fried veggie fries, cheese, tomato, greens or lettoce, etc to urs. Without a bun or use a low carb bun sub. Put ketchup and maybe cheese on kiddos. Serve them the veggie chips or fries, but nix the kimchi and toppings they likely wont like. \n\n\nTacos. Use fresh onion and peppers with eggs or otger protien, or do frozen bell pepper and onion blend. Cook in keto safe fat. Add to low carb tortilla or lettice wrap for u with toppings , use liw carb tortilla and likely no toppings for kiddo. \n\n\nLow carb pizza. Ive gor three options for crusys, one being using a low carb tortilla, one ising italian sausage, and one using egg whites whipped into aerangue and a bit of coconut flour added in then baked. Any of these u would not have to alter at all for kiddo unless they dont like veggies on their pizza and u do. But if ur not into veg on pizza as toppings, just do any of these as a pepperoni pizza with a good old side salad for ur veg and just let kid eat pizza. \n\nThen there are options where u do carbs seperate so u have ur keto iption, kiddo does non keto. Fried rice for example. U do stir fry. Do fried rice separate or do cauli fried rice for u and normal fried rice for kiddo. \n\nSpaghetti/alfredo/pesto. U make kelp or shiritake noodkez for u, normal noidles for kiddo. Or do kelp/shiritake/veg noodkes for everyone. \n\n\nSouos and stews, u dont have to make a keto and non keto optuon at all. Same with yogurt or cottage cheese bowls. Tuna salad/chicken salad sandwhiches, even ehg salad, use a couple slices of home maxe carnivore bread. U can use that for the whole family inuding kiddo and nobody would know. \n\n\nHeck even ham and cheese sandwhich on varnivore bread is a option for kuddo, but add toppings like lettuce, tomato, mayo, etc tp urs. Do a salad or home mafe veggie chips ad ur side, veggie chips for kid. Throw in some strwaberries for dessert maybe with lillys choc chips. Easy keto picniv lunch or gamily dinner. No fuss, no muss, no seperate meal or side effort needed .\n\nEgg, meat and veg frittatas, scrambled eggs and bacon with pancakes made if egg, protien powder, and a bit of mashed banana and baking powder and topped with berries cooked in ghee with stevia and cinnimon and nuts and or hwc /sugar free whipoed cream is a everubody breakfast /breakfast for lunch or dinner option. Stuff kids wont fuss over, and are as keyo fteindky as it gets. \n\nHeck, potato pancakes are something i learned about with my ex. kids like them too. But if u use egg, coconut flour, and grated eggplant u can make a keto version and pair with good old eggs and bacon. Both kid and u eont tell the difference it u seadon and cook right.",

            "comment": "Why is cooking two different meals impossible? I am used to cooking 3 different meals for me, my kids and my wife and if you plan it smartly you can do it all at the same time. If you cook for example meat, with potatoes and vegetables, you just cook the chicken, cook spinach and cook potatoes. You can eat the meat and the spinach is for all of you and you mash up the potatoes for your kids and leave a few hole for your partner. There are plenty more tricks, you can cook keto Bolognese sauce and throw it on spaghetti for your kids and on spiralled courgette for yourself. And there are lot of meals you can cook and freeze. Cook 3 beef burgers, put two on buns for your partner and your kid, and yours between two lettuce leaves. And you have only 1 kid it seems, which is quite a breeze compared to having twins, or triplets. So see it from the positive side. \n\nAnd brains run on glucose or ketones, not carbs",

Easy to air fry potato wedges ( or baked potato) for the child.  You can also add those microwaved pasta cups ( but don\u2019t use the nuclear cheese powder, add shredded cheese and butter.). Takes three minutes.  Carbs are cheap so if he doesn\u2019t eat the toast it\u2019s not a big time or money investment.  Also fruit!  Add a serving of fruit\u2026 instant carbs.",

Easier than eating a traditional American diet. Saved time, not the reverse. \n\nI cook all my meat and veggies on Sunday. That\u2019s what i eat all week.

Most of our household meals are meat with a lower carb veggie. The 2 year old is a big fan of green beans which we tend to have frequently. \n\nMy husband does most of the cooking (woohoo!!) so he has to deal with it more than I do from that perspective, but recently we signed up for a meal service to mix things up for him and the 11 year old. Most of the meals we pick aren't keto-friendly so I usually have leftovers. We usually make extra meat for most of our basic dinners so that helps when we have things I won't eat. \n\nI do cook breakfast on the weekends sometimes, like pancakes or French toast for the family, but I'll just make eggs for myself. Sometimes we do eggs and bacon and throw biscuits in the oven or they'll make toast. \n\nWith spaghetti, they'll have regular noodles and I'll have frozen noodles. For taco night, I make a salad while they use taco shells. For burgers, I just skip the bun. We have a great keto meatloaf recipe that we all like that we haven't had in a while. \n\nMy diet is my choice, but I don't have to have a carb-free house to stick with it. We have plenty of things with carbs for the kids or my husband that I wouldn't eat under other circumstances anyway.",

            "comment": "From what I have learned, any glucose your body needs (this includes babies and children), your liver will supply via gluconeogenisis. There isn't really any reason to take in carbs from your diet, besides just \"liking\" to eat them, or if there is a food shortage and all there is to supplement the protein and fat are rice, beans, grain, or vegetables. Otherwise, there is really no need.\n\nI've had six children within a 10 year window. For four of those pregnancies, I was not living a ketogenic lifestyle. My first two, I was actually more on a plant based diet, nutritarian way of eating (with fish and turkey meat occasionally), vegan at times (not good for me or babies). The next two pregnancies, I was more of a standard American diet, or you could say standard Filipino/Asian diet. My last two pregnancies, I was low carb/keto. I am currently more ketovore and possibly going to be on my seventh pregnancy. Which I will more than likely keep the ketovore way of eating, because I feel best this way.\n\nI can say that living a ketogenic lifestyle has fared much better than any lifestyle I've lived. I was incredibly inflamed before, living with chronic pain and obesity, even when doing plant based whole foods (since there was fruit, whole grain, etc, you get it).\n\nMy children and my husband are not keto, but I encourage them daily to make informed choices about what they put into their bodies and on their bodies. \n\nI'm not sure if any of this information is helpful, but long story short, yes, living a ketogenic lifestyle is sustainable and doable with family members who are keto or not. Cooking separate meals and preparing ahead (like a prep day for your meals) is just a reality if one wants to live the ketogenic lifestyle with or without the family following it.\n\nMany have already shared useful tips in preparing your personal meals and your family's meals. Like many, I simply cook a separate (usually uncomplicated) meal for myself and just cook the usual somewhat healthy, balanced whole food  meals for my family. It isn't always easy, but worth it to stay on the path and even show my loved ones they can do it too.\n\nI hope you can find a way to sustain the ketogenic lifestyle. You know from many years of living it how great it is for your health and general well being. \n\nBest of luck!",

            "comment": "My roommates (keto) have 5 kids (who aren't). It basically comes down to a couple different strategies:\n\n* They have \"dinner\" and \"kid dinner\" when making two meals makes more sense. Things like pizza or frozen breaded meats or whatever don't make sense as an input into keto, so they'll just cook that and then also make an adult keto dinner. \n\n* They'll make food which is keto and then the kids will have that in addition to bread / fruit / whatever. \n\n* Sometimes the meals are straight keto, and snacks throughout the day are carby instead. So like they'll make a giant pile of eggs and bacon as a meal and then the kids can have bread / fruit then or later.\n\n* The kids will also make their own meals or snacks or each other's meals or snacks when that isn't physically possible, which seems to work well.\n\nIn addition to these strategies, it's important to remember that making meals of *any* kind doesn't have to be a giant ordeal. You can meal prep, buy precooked stuff, opt for food that doesn't require a lot of prep work, grill or smoke stuff in batch, eat veggies semi-raw, turn snacks into meals, etc.\n\n&gt; but I still strongly believe that developping brains need a lot of carbs.\n\nWhatever amount they need can be provided through GNG. Not saying you should make your kid keto, but you don't have to load them down with carbs either. It's also worth pointing out that the keto diet was originally formulated for kids.",

When I'm cooking for wider family I make 3 different meals! A veggie version, meat version and keto version. So learned a few things on the way. Basically you add the carbs in last, so for instance; \n\nSpaghetti Bolognese: just make the sauce and cook the pasta and your \"pasta\" separate. I use shredded cabbage personally. My son actually likes this one so he'll often have that aswell! \n\nPizza: make a bunch of bases and keep them in the freezer, that way when it's pizza night you can throw one together as quick as a regular one.\n\nTapas: Often I'll cut up lots of raw veg and we'll have meats and cheeses with it. My son likes to have chicken nuggets on the side, I season steak + chicken and cook them in cubes in air fryer. I serve the whole thing as a platter basically so you just pick what you want. \n\nBBQ Brisket: Same method just use erythritol instead  of regular sugar. Also don't put potatoes on your plate ofc just have more brisket instead! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nPicnics: I make a salad \ud83e\udd57 so a portable salad bowl would be good to get! And for my son + friends I make regular sandwiches. \n\nMovie nights: I cut up cucumber, celery and cheese into bitesize pieces then put in a big bowl with some tiny tomatoes. My son actually prefers this to popcorn!\n\nI think bottom line is cook the carbs separate and you can all eat the same thing \ud83d\udc4d",

What's weird is that intuitively I'd like to eat more, but since I've developed bad habits with my dieting, I have to be very conscious of what desires I have and what aspects I choose to satisfy and which ones I choose to inhibit.   \n\n\nIt's not easy, but so far this approach of just simply eating less whether I feel like eating more or not seems to work for me.

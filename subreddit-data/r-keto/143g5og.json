    "postText": "Hey all,  \nI have some great tasting cinnamon roll flavored casein powder. I'm trying to figure out how to make it thick enough to be a 'dough', so I can roll it in on itself like a cinnamon roll. Does anyone have any suggestions?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCinnamon rolls are the one desert I cannot recreate on keto in a satisfying way and they are my favorite desert. This casein powder used in mug cakes, or just microwaved with some water and brown sugar swerve is better than \\*any\\* complex recipe I've followed using almond flour and/or coconut flower. So I really need to find a way to turn this into a dough, please! That way I can roll it in on itself with brown sugar swerve and cinnamon.  \nThank you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\np.s. I'm using Dymatize Elite Casein Protein Powder",

I\u2019ve yet to be able to turn it into a \u201cmoldable\u201d dough but if you play around with amounts I\u2019m sure you make something at least kind of resembling cinnamon rolls",

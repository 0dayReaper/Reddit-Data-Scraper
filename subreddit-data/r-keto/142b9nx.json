You don\u2019t need any fancy products or pills for sodium and potassium. Magnesium glycinate is very cheap on amazon to boot.\n\nThe keto flu is nothing more than electrolyte deficiency. It can happen anytime you are deficient, not just at the start.

Plants are for fun, not nutrition. Meat heals. \n\nNow that I got that out of they way, the way that I kept my electrolytes up was that I drank a glass of water with potassium and magnesium in the morning and at night. The one at night seemed to be the most important. I salt my food to taste during the day. \n\nAfter a few years of keto, and now carnivore, I only need electrolytes on very active sweaty days. Pre low-carb, I had horrible leg cramps at night and restless leg syndrome. When I started taking the electrolytes and doing low carb, my symptoms almost completely disappeared.",

Even if you're thinking, you can still be insulin resistant, which can cause these hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) migraines.\nBuy a glucose meter from the store. They're cheap. Start of just going low carb. If you get hypoglycemic, take in the recommended 15g of sugar, eat a low carb meal, and move on. Adjust your day around it to stay under your daily target. As you lose weight, this will get better.",

When i first started keto and id a year and a half ago i originally tried tge 20 g net carb lomit standard. \n\nU know what hapoened? i got migrains bad enough to cause er trips. Kinda like what ur dealing witb now except it wasnt just nausea, i often vomited from the pain and it woukd last anuwhere from 12-72 hours. I couldnt even keep water down so the effrcts of the migrains caused dehydration baf enough that i had the er trip. Especially with tge psych meds i was taking at rhe time. Not staying hydrated could cause those meds to shut down my liver and kidneys. \n\nNow, with that in mind i gave up the standard 20 g net caeb limit and opted for a 50g net as my start point. I adjusted my macros and cals accordingly. \n\nOver time ive slowly weaned down. My current carb limit is 30g net. And fir now i feel that is safe for me.\n\nOp, hypoglycemia will not show on bloodwork. Every time they run tests ur bloodsugar will look normal because what happens is u eat, ur glucose spikes, then ur insulin spikes higher to push it down but sometimes pushes it from high to low, as in too low. Then u get headaches, migrains, etc because the carbs and sugar cause essentialky a severe hangover from hell. Its also why i still crave carbs and sugar. My body simply ia addicted, but now at least i can hit tge cravings with lots of protien and lower carb options. \n\nIf im craving sweet, my morning yogurt bowl with berrues, vanilla protuen powder in a pinch but mostly choc protien powder, maybe some mct oil powder and nuts, along with meat or fish, etc, really knocks it out.\n\nIf im craving more of the davory stuff, tgen things like jerky , boiled egg with sakt, bacon, pumpkin seeds, air fried veggie fries/chips made from turnips or rutabgea, cheese all tend to knock those out as do mashed potato subs or a good old stir fry.\n\nOp, i really hope this hekos some. I personally am all too familiar wuth this issue and electrolytes were not tge answer in my case. Weaning down the carbs and baby stepping was",

I switched to a keto electrolyte mix called keppi I found on Amazon and use 2 scoops a day, which provides calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium. If I skip a day I start to get leg cramps and migraines. Make sure to sip on it though, too much potassium at once can be dangerous.",

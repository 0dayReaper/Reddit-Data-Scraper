That's why i hate Italian coffee beans. They roast the fk out of their beans. \n\nBut with that out of the picture - try adding a small pinch of salt to coffee when you brew it. Brings out more flavour and reduces the acidity",

It is much thicker than what I can buy at my local grocery. \n\nTip:  If you can\u2019t get through that much cream, before it goes bad, whip it and freeze it.  If you freeze liquid cream the texture will be affected, but if you whip it before freezing, the texture will be fine. Freeze in smaller quantities and thaw in the refrigerator overnight. Add vanilla and sweetener if you want it for dessert or sweet coffee. Leave it unflavored if you want to be able to use it in savory cooking.",

But I discovered that adding a pinch of baking soda to the grounds before adding the water made all the difference.   \n\n\nI always use HWC, but before I used baking soda in the grounds, the HWC didn't make the flavor difference I was expecting. Now, it does (unless for some reason it's gone slightly off - since I keep a pint in my work fridge for purpose, sometimes I can't quite use it all before it begins to sour, but if I suspect, I always pour it into a spoon first to check. Nothing like ruining a cup of good coffee with off cream.)",

Try having a meal without drinking water.\n\nIt's likely that you just need time to adjust. Increase your fat slowly and take digestive enzymes for the short term if it's really bad.",

My husband and I drink a Gatorade zero at least every other day to prevent leg cramps. We don't go over 20 carbs a day and usually have our veggies with dinner. I have an Atkins shake with my coffee in the morning and keep an Atkins bar in my car to go with a lunch of hard boiled eggs, cheese sticks and or SF jerkey sometimes I will have some porkrinds with lunch.

If you're nauseous after eating more fat and possibly notice changes in stool color and consistency, you should definitely followup with your doctor. You could also try eating some kale and drinking a glass of grapefruit juice if you're not on any medications that are contraindicated. Those will encourage fresh bile production. Additionally, you could try incorporating a bile acid supplement. But talk it all over with your medical team.",

Also kale and grapefruit juice (4oz Knudsen just grapefruit) barring any contraindications, increase soluble fiber maybe from chia seeds. If you get checked out by a doctor and it is gallbladder related and you don't want to get your gall bladder removed you can ask for Ursodiol to break down any gallstones or gall sludge more quickly. That coupled with the above diet changes should be sufficient, although you may want to switch to low carb and not keto for a while, depending on your goals.\n\nAdditional advice for overall wellness support would be: take a multivitamin, take vitamin c tablet before a meal with a lot of meat in it, get your electrolytes and trace minerals(I like miracles of health liquid chelated minerals, you can get them from Walmart delivery), track your nutrition with cronometer, and try to get at least 3L of water a day. That would be a good start",

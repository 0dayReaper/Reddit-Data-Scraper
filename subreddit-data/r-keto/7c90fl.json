    "postText": " So, I woke up this morning and thought that I might weigh myself and see how things are going.  I did my normal step on the scale three times to make sure that what I was seeing was correct.  This is the highest of the three:         \n          \nhttps://imgur.com/996x4BM         \n    \n200 POUNDS IN ONE YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      \n      \nI am proud of what I have done over the past 363 days.     \nI am happy about what I done over the past 363 days.    \nI am...a little \"misty\" about all of this right now.    \n        \nI promise everyone here I have worked hard for this.  I promise everyone that I have earned this.  I promise everyone that YOU are as responsible for this as I am!  I promise you that YOU made me work harder.  YOU made me want this even more.  I thank each and every one of you for your kind words, for just being nice to me, and even your words of admonishment.  I honestly feel like I can conquer the world.  I know I have a bunch more work to do, but right now, I just feel good.  I feel powerful.  I feel AWESOME!!!!  \n   \nBefore and so far:     https://imgur.com/hEdJ7wK       \n   \nI will take a few days off--not from keto, but from being so focused.  Maybe a little vacation from the intensity.  Maybe just enjoy this for a few days.  I have many many many more goals.  I now have one year to get to 270 pounds.  One year to lose 123 pounds.  I will make a post about what I will accomplish over the next year some day next week.  But right now, I just want to enjoy my win!!!     \n      \nNow for the best part of this:  I try my best to show my gratitude to all of you keto friends, and I am afraid I fall short.  NOTHING I say can properly convey to you just how grateful I am to each and every one of you.  And I know I have said this twice already this week, but I AM THE LUCKIEST MAN ALIVE!      \n\nThank you so much my friends.    \n   \nBrian       \n",

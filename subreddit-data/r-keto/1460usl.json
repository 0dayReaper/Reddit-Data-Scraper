Having had a serious serious tooth and general ill disciple to diet, I\u2019ve always struggled.\n\nI cannot believe I have no craving for sugar 3 weeks into Keto, literally don\u2019t even think about it anymore. I\u2019ve dropped 10 lbs last 3 weeks even though I have not increased physical activity, just stuck to Keto.\n\nI also came out of ketosis 2x due to a wedding &amp; 1 weekend where I accidentally forgot to stay Keto, and still dropped the pounds.\n\nThose that are new to the diet, keep going it only gets easier.",

At this point you are essentially balanced and efficient at utilising ketones and that physical desire for glucose is absent.\n\nThe psychological aspects of sugar craving I think is more dependant on an individual.  How bad your sugar use was prior to the diet, how clean your keto diet has been and frankly your willpower which most of us need at some point.\n\nSugar is gasoline on a fire, if you keep adding a bit here and there it reignites the flames.  Be good and let the fire die.",

Now if I have the urge to over eat i always look at what I'm eating.  I had a 3 day craving after deep fried costco wings just salivating at the thought and fantasizing about bringing 2 buckets home and eating them all in secret.  When is as eating i had to pace myself with the rest of the group and i stopped at 10!  \n\nWhen I tried to reduce sat fat and increase avocado oil consumption I wasnt binging but I started snacking a lot more.",

Other things (like hunger and satiety) have nothing to do with discipline. \n\nDiscipline is when you go grocery shopping and don\u2019t buy Oreos. \n\nBinge eaters don\u2019t buy the Oreos at the store, but then it\u2019s midnight and they sneak out to the all night grocery and get a big package of Oreos and eat them all in the car and throw away the package so no one knows. Ask me how I know this. \n\nPeople who have a healthy relationship to food and hunger don\u2019t do that, and it\u2019s not because of willpower or discipline. It\u2019s because they aren\u2019t fighting with insane cravings 24/7. For many people with binge eating disorders, keto still requires them to use discipline at the store, but getting up and doing crazy food things at midnight just doesn\u2019t happen, because they don\u2019t have the same kind of food cravings.",

Rinse and repeat. This has caused me relatively few ill effects in my life, so I'm at peace with my personality... But...\n\nBut the key to success is discipline, and personal accountability. These are practiced skills.\n\nAnd it's perfectly possible that, after your body adjusts to a keto diet, to binge on keto foods. I know I've eaten 3 pints of rebel ice cream in 1 sitting just because they were in the house.\n\nCouldn't fathom doing that 16 years ago when I started keto, but gradually, I got used to the neurochemical changes, and I'm back to relying on discipline and other healthy coping mechanisms again.\n\nOP needs to use this time of temporary reprieve from their binge eating, to develop a whole host of healthy coping strategies to combat future binges. And that, again, comes down to having the discipline to do so.",

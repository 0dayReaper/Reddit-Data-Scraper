    "postText": "Hey, there my beloved and lovely community. I once remarked that I was going through a difficult phase in my life and that everything had gone wrong, from my food to the way I live, as a result of my spending up to 14 hours per day at my desk.\u00a0Now I can say \"War is over\". I completed preparing for that horrific test. I'm allowed to live and carry on with my life as I did a year ago. I can get back to eating\u00a0stress-free, brisk walking,\u00a0and exercising, as well as consuming real food. It's hard for me to realize I'm genuinely free!\n\nthen, my lovely people. I want to return to keto, but I think I blew it\u00a0up last time, so could you kindly educate me on how to do it correctly?   \n\u00a0I 19F, 138 kg (304 lbs), 169 cm (5ft5 ), 1600 calories: 105 g protein, 20 g carb, 100 g fat.  \nI'll be exercising/walking for at least 30 to 60 minutes.",

That fills me for the day. Later on I can be reasonable and avoid sugar/carbs. Following day: no blood sugar spikes and I\u2019m off on my keto journey.",

            "comment": "Wonderful News!! \n\nFrom the macros you stipulated, I would increase the amount of fat and reduce the protein and I would set net carbs at a max of 15gr. The reasoning is to get you adapted asap and in order to do that, the less carbs you consume, the better. Once you are fully fat adapted, then the macros you wrote in the post are great (as the FAQ says: the more fat you have to lose, the more you should focus on protein so you give your body the possibility to burn through your fat reserves). \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is the calorie deficit, for the first 2-4 weeks I would not care for the calories as you want to get your adapted quickly and fat are calorie dense (1gr of fat = 9 calories), once you are fully adapted, then start the calorie deficit. \n\nYou need to find what makes you less stressed in terms of lifestyle changes, as a change is already stressful on the body you don\u2019t want to put more stress on it.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t forget your electrolytes!!! \n\nGood luck and keep us posted! :)",

            "comment": "Try your best to stay away from prepackaged \u201cketo\u201d foods.  A lot of them have hidden sugars and carbs, try to eat as much real foods not processed as you can stand.\n\nTry to wean yourself off of fried foods, and if you fry at home try to use a better oil like tallow, butter, ghee or olive oils(check label to ensure no canola oil). Vegetable oils help to drive some of the carb cravings. \n\nNo one else seemed to mention it, but make sure you supplement.  Especially when starting to go into ketosis. It helps minimize keto flu. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s info in the sidebar, but potassium, magnesium and a few others are recommended. Or make sure you have a no sugar electrolyte drink available. \n\nDrink plenty of water, tea and coffee. Even Diet soda still causes a insulin response in some. \n\nI\u2019d suggest NOT drinking your calories. Stay away from Keto labeled shakes etc unless it\u2019s the only way you can stay on your macros. I\u2019m sure some will disagree, but that\u2019s an easy way to add to many calories. \n\nGood luck! And don\u2019t let setbacks discourage you. Just jump back in, and get rolling again it gets easier with every iteration as you learn more and discover how your body responds.",

Though standard keyo is high fat adequate protien.\n\nAlso with women especially, they tend to need at least 90 g complete protien daily. Though if they pair incinplete with a complete protien it gets absorbed like a complete protien.\n\nIm 5'2 and currently doing 148 g of protien, 67g fat limit, and a 30g net carb limit. My cals are 1315 and im 36, almost 37, wright atound 140 pounds . Current goal is 130 pounds . \n\nI personally started with standard high fat keto and did that all last year. This year i switched to higher protuen because with high fat i wasnt meeting my goals and i was far too hungry. Going high protien solved that\n\nThough its a lot easier starting off with high fat and adjusting later.",

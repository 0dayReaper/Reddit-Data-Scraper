    "postText": "Frappuccinos CANNOT be made keto. If you swap whole milk for heavy cream and sweetener for sugar free vanilla, all you've done is consume half a cup of heavy cream and ~40g+ carbs from our emulsifying frappuccinos base, which is a thick sugary syrup. (Yesterday I clocked in and someone managed to gulp down a large frappuccino like this and tell the person at register she was on a LCHF diet and it was delicious and wanted a second. I was busy taking orders in the drive thru and couldn't help the poor woman.) ALSO please do not try to drink a grande heavy cream latte. Even a tall, has 10 oz of milk (2 oz espresso and the rest milk for 12 oz). If you would like an espresso drink, order a hot or iced americano with heavy cream, which would be espresso + water + milk, and you can add any of the sugar free syrups if you like. \n\nIf you are unsure if we put heavy cream in your coffee (you can usually tell because heavy cream can leave small undisolved particles in your drink which go away when stirred, or if the color seems too dark) then ask us. We understand dietary restrictions and want to make sure you get what you are paying for!\n\nOur ice coffee and ice tea come sweetened, as instructed by our recipes. Our cold brew ice coffee does not, but ask for all of these unsweetened anyways, then substitute whatever you like, out of sugar free vanilla or sugar free cinnamon dolce (mixing them together is heaven for me). Our skinny mocha sauce contains few carbs depending on the size, if it fits in your macros it can help curb a mean chocolate craving. Our hot coffee and hot tea do not come pre-sweetened and you have the same syrup options as above, or your own. These are the safest options for getting what you want, esp. a nice dark roast pour over... \ud83e\udd24 anyways.. We use Kerry gold butter squares you can ask for on the side if you like as well. \n\nLastly, if you have any questions AT ALL, do not be afraid to ask your register person or a barista that doesn't look too busy. We also have a designated person that can help customer needs, they can usually be found wearing a timer attached to their apron, restocking and cleaning things, if your register person is busy. Whether it's for how to order a drink, or what have you, don't be afraid! It took me at least a month to be able to remember even most of the menu, it can be daunting.  The only thing we wouldn't know, is the nutrition info for your drink, because most of these require some math. \n\nI know for most people Starbucks is unnessecary, but for those who regularly get their energy fix here, I thought this would help as these are some of the things I notice LCHF customers seem to have confusion with. I'm open to any questions you guys might have! KCKO!\n\nEdit for clarification: The recipes for our ice teas and ice coffees, by default, say to add pumps of sweetener. However, they are brewed with plain tea leaves/plain coffee grinds. :)\n\nEdit 2: it's also worth noting our egg bites have 9g carbs for bacon ones and 11g carbs for egg white ones, they have added rice starch sadly. On frappucinnos; you can ask to get your drink blended without base emulsifier, but the flavor and texture will be no where near the same and some stores will say no. On drink recommendations; everyone's taste is different so I recommend googling some Starbucks keto recipes and trying what you think might be good :)\n\nEdit 3, the edit to end all edits: if you guys are unsure if you're drink is ok, the safest thing you can do is log it, and that goes for any food or drink you might have going past your lips. Nutrition info for half and half, 2%, most almond milks, etc. are all online, again I don't know for your specific drink, so it's safer to look it up! Second, *frappuccinos are not keto.* you can attempt at a keto \"frappuccino\" but by standards it's not a frappuccino, the baristas *can and might* say no, the consistency is not the same, and they might put in the emulsifier base anyways. Third, I'm not gonna tell you not to drink a whole cup of heavy whipping cream, I'm just warning everyone that it's not smart to drink 6, 10, 14, or 18 oz. of heavy whipping cream in one go (short, tall, grande, and Venti respectively). If you can't live without your grande heavy cream flat white then don't. Lastly, thanks for the gold!! \ud83d\udc95",

Our standard recipe is: pour double brewed tea into shaker (brewed to be twice as strong so we're not making new tea every 5 min), cut with filtered water, add liquid cane sugar, add ice, shake to bring out flavor of tea, pour into cup.\n\nHowever, since most people in this area (I'm in orange county.) would rather have ice tea unsweetened, we ask when you are ordering if it is sweetened or not.\n\nNow when I was in Nashville, where sweet tea is popular, it was different.\n\nif most people get it sweetened you would rather not ask, have to remake a drink occasionally, and train your customer to ask for it unsweetened next time; than to ask every customer.\n\nTL;DR Although standard recipe has sweetener, if you're in a market that sells mostly unsweetened tea, we generally ask at the register.",

You can of course add more shots or more syrup if you want to customize it. \n\nSyrup is of choice, but vanilla is the standard go-to. \nYou are then supposed to chug the undertow and it's hot and strong at first but very quickly becomes cold and sweet.\n\nMost new people won't know how to make it, so ask if anyone in the store knows how. (Syrup-&gt;Cream-&gt;Backside spoon on top-&gt;pull shots on top of backside of spoon-&gt;remove spoon-&gt;Undertow)",

You pour a hot shot gently over the back of a spoon so it layers on top and doesn't mix. \n\nYou drink it right away in one or two gulps, and the hot bitter/cold sweet contrast is tasty. \n\nCustomers almost never order these, it's mostly a barista drink, since it's gone in 10 seconds.",

Now I just drink it black. My preferred method is pour over, but there are other ways, too, to extract the super delicious taste from those coffee beans. Different beans have their own taste profiles, too. Some are very sweet and bright, others have a darker, more chocolate profile, and there's a whole range in between.\n\nI didn't think I'd ever get used to black coffee. Now, it is, without a doubt, my #1 favorite drink. The thought of drinking coffee with anything else in it just doesn't even occur to me anymore.\n\nAgain, I know everyone has their own preferences, so I'm not saying, \"This is the only way!\" Not trying to be a coffee snob or anything. :-) Just saying, I highly recommend giving it a try. And black coffee definitely = keto friendly!",

Prior to that, I was boiling water, pouring it into a tea kettle, and then trying do pour over with that. I got more decent with it than I thought I would, lol. And it definitely tasted better than drip coffee. But the gooseneck kettle - SO much easier!\n\nIf you have an iOS device, the app Filtru is *fantastic*, too, for timing your brews.

When I can afford it, I decide in advance and prepare by putting one serving of whatever non-dairy creamer I personally I have on hand in a water bottle before leaving the house (because HWC would get gross without refrigeration) + 1 tsp of MCT oil. Then I take that shit with me and always just get a tall iced Americano or a tall black/unsweetened iced coffee, which I add my own little creamy concoction to! It works out nicely, and I know exactly what I'm having. \n\nI can't handle not knowing exact amounts and stuff if I were to just ask for splash of HWC or whatever lol, and I hate that all of the non-dairy milks at Starbucks have added sugar, drives me nuts! Anyway. I'm sure this is gonna help some people out. Thanks for posting! c:",

This is totally a calorie + fat bomb of a drink but since I don't usually do this I'm up for it.\n\nGrande Espresso Frap\nNo Base\nAdd shot (It's only 2, probably best to do Triple)\nHeavy Cream\nAdd Protein\n\nIt blended mostly well. It's a bit choppy --a splash of water would help. Some of the protein isn't completely blended so it almost feels like a caramel swirl except without the flavor. Flavor wise it has a strong coffee flavor almost like a Peet's Freddo. I think subbing a shot of the Frap Roast with espresso would make the flavor smoother. \n\nI'll be honest -- I went with some whipped cream. I know it has sugar but I think it really helps the flavor a bit after it starts to melt into the drink.\n\nBtw, the cashier / barista was very helpful. I'm sure they hear it all so there's never a 'weird drink' for them.",

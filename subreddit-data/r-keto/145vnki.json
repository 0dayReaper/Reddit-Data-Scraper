    "postText": "Been doing keto for a month now, but some days when I\u2019ve been going pretty strict, especially in the evening, I often find myself waking up with a pretty intense hangover, to the extent that I need a painkiller to get out of bed.\nAlso it\u2019s not uncommon to wake up a couple of hours of sleep with the typical keto symptoms, super dry mouth and general feeling of being a bit ill, very similar to when I\u2019m out drinking and going to bed, where I usually wake up after a few hours when the alcohol is starting to leave the body.\n\nUsually it\u2019s so uncomfortable that I end up eating carbs and drinking loads of water just before bed, or when I wake up in the night, just to get me out of this state and to not be hungover, but this is less then optimal because it means I need to get into ketosis again every morning. This is getting pretty irritating and I\u2019m starting to get frustrated about it. \n\nAnyone experiencing the same things that have any tips how to reduce this?\nIm taking vitamin c, and a multivitamin with zink/magnesium etc every morning, drinking at least 4 liters of water every morning, eating a decent dose of veggies every day, etc.\n\nThanks for any tips! Been googling a bit but I only find similarities from when people actually are drinking on keto, while I have this almost daily without drinking.\n\nThanks for any tips!",

You don\u2019t need any fancy products or pills for sodium and potassium. Magnesium glycinate is very cheap on amazon to boot.\n\nThe keto flu is nothing more than electrolyte deficiency. It can happen anytime you are deficient, not just at the start. Google \u201cketoade recipes\u201d and start feeling better. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nThere\u2019s more info in the FAQ if you\u2019d like to know more:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq",

            "comment": "Carbs before bed is really destructive.  You have the negative effect of digestion, they will pull you out of ketosis just as you are about to sleep through a decent period of it.  The carbs will also restore glycogen, your body stores 2.7g of water for every 1g of glycogen and so that might be why you feel like crap in the morning.\n\nYou're dehydrated, probably electrolyte depleted as you will store more on exiting ketosis.\n\nCut out the carbs completely, hydrate at a steadier pace (4 ltr in the am is too much), ensure you're getting good electrolyte quantities.",

    "postText": "https://imgur.com/gallery/sewBzNl (NSFW - Fat dude in swimming trunks).\n\nI'm finally less than 100 kg, for the first time since early 2017. This has been accomplished by roughly one month of Keto - I got back on the wagon May 1, had a few stumbles, was hospitalised for four and a half day in the middle of everything and obviously I wasn't keto during those days, but since May 16 I've been on a streak. This is Day 22 since I was discharged and I haven't had a single cheat day. \n\nWhen the before pictures were taken I was at 109.8 kg, or 242.1 lbs. I was actually a little bit heavier right before my keto journey resumed in May, but I didn't take any new pics before I started and the difference was only like a kilogram or something so whatever.",

I never took pictures of myself so I didn\u2019t see the weight loss for while, but it really hit me and was very satisfying when I was able to wear a certain sweater that literally squeezed me when I put it on. The sweater fit perfectly lol. Definitely can see the improvement, I swear I look at my old fat self and I looked like shit. I look like a complete different human.",

I actually did keto the first time a really long time ago (I mean, my first keto run was in 2013-14, I lost over 30 kg but regained after serious illness). I have done it several times since then but never with this much success. \n\nI had a hospital stay recently which sort of \"scared me straight\" I guess. I can't afford to live like this if I want to see my kids grow up and be able to be an active dad. \n\nWhen I first got on the keto wagon in 2013, it was about looking better and, let's be honest, it was partially because I wanted girls to notice me. Ten years later I got a wife and two kids, and now more than anything else, it's for thme.",

    "postText": "Hey there! I have lost 45lbs over the last year on keto and I\u2019m now overweight rather than obese per the not-so-helpful BMI chart - which is great!  5\u20194\u201d female, 31yo\n\nI was excited to see my bloodwork improve, but my cholesterol numbers are a little concerning after receiving the results. \n\nTotal cholesterol: 290\nLDL: 212\nHDL: 61\nTriglycerides: 85\n\nHDL and triglycerides seem good to me, but I\u2019m not a doctor. Do good HDL and triglycerides numbers ever outweigh poor ldl numbers? \n\nAny suggestions to maintain this lifestyle and manage cholesterol?\n\nThanks all!",

You can have high lipid count if the individual size is 1/10th of the normal. This is why its important to tell your doc that you are on keto, and finding a doc that knows about keto.",

There are lots of ambulances at accidents, but that didn't mean they caused the accidents.  In fact quite the opposite... they're there to help with the accidents.\n\nSecond, within \"LDL,\" to really understand LDL you need to know your LDL-P numbers, which can segregate by size ... \"a\" is small and \"b\" is big.  Even the people who refuse to believe my first point concede that it's the small LDL that is problematic, while the large LDL is actually \"good\" for you.  Yes, \"good\" LDL exists.  My LDL alarms some people at 190.  But both my small LDL is in the top 5% of those treated (&lt;700-1000 is considered good, I'm &lt;90... an excellent score).  Similarly, my large LDL is excellent (&gt;20.5 is good, I'm 22.5).  I definitely credit six years of keto for these results.\n\nMy point here is that my overall cholesterol is deemed high.  My LDL is deemed high.  My doctor wanted me off keto and on statins.  But after some investigation... NO WAY!\n\nYour numbers are good.  You're doing a great job.  Keep working at it... see if you can get your HDL/ triglyceride ratio above 1!    Keep on keto-ing!",

If so, it\u2019s normal for triglycerides/HDL to see huge improvements and LDL to go up for awhile during that time. Same thing happened to me and after I hit my goal weight and started eating keto at maintenance calories everything normalized. Now my blood work comes back perfect, and I\u2019m 5.5 years into keto.",

There are several newer, better designed studies that include women where the data suggests that higher cholesterol may be protective in women.  And at least does not seem to increase risk.  I would not take that as gospel, but simply use it to point out how much we really don't understand even though certain things are held as absolute truths in medicine.  And therefore you really should not panic.",

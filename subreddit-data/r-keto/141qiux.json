    "postText": "I've started my Blood Glucose testing after picking up a $30 tester/harpoons/test strips kit. Inspired by Steve @ Serious Keto, I thought I would add to the body of knowledge a bit with a Blood Glucose impact test on the Inked Keto - Timber Wolf Keto Seeds bread that our Costco now offers. No affiliation or financial gain from either in my future. \n\n\\- Blood Glucose: **87 mmol/liter** \\- morning test after 12 hour fast and several days of 20-30 gram Carbs\n\n\\- After eating 2 slices of the Inked Keto bread, with a small amount of butter:\n\n\\- Blood Glucose: **87 mmol/liter after 2 hours 15 minutes**\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n\\- Inked Keto bread doesn't tastes more like saw dust (Psyllium husks) than bread, but it does have a decent texture. \n\n\\- 14 hour overnight fast before test\n\n\\- Past week of 20-30 gm carbs/day\n\n\\- Not diabetic, no diagnosed psychological 'isms (my wife isn't a professional psychologist)\n\n\\- Was Pre-Hypertension, now in optimal blood pressure range. \n\n\\- Doing keto for physical health (mental/physical/energy) and weight loss. And I love eating meat. \n\nThanks to u/Distinct-Dish3096 for the reminder to post results!",

            "comment": "Thanks for posting this! This is by far my favorite keto bread, and I eat it a couple times a week with no ketosis issues. I test my blood for ketones and glucose daily - never did a test specific to eating this bread though, so it\u2019s nice to see your results. \n\nWhen I crave something sweet, I toast this bread and put sugar free peanut butter and hazelnut spread on it, and it tastes like a giant Ferraro Rocher. \ud83e\udd0c",

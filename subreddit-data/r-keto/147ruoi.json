I don't imagine that's a keto thing, since I've been keto for years and this is starting just recently. 56m, exercise a lot, have been upping my protein levels and lowering my fat a bit recently, but other than that same old keto that I've been doing for over five years.

The changed factors are essentially 1) getting older (56m), and possible thermogenic effect of bumping my protein up to minimum 180 grams daily since I've been strength training more regularly. The other consideration is that, while keto is not new to me, neither is anything else. I'm a creature of habit, and everything else is as dialed in and consistent as my keto omad 3:00 p.m. diet. Really just protein uptick and getting older.",

Even with the AC set to 65\u00b0 the mattress beneath me still seems warm, even if the air is cool. I'll check it out. I seem to recall that they are around $600? Easy enough to Google.",

I've gotten very systematic, and I try not to go overboard with anything or to take unnecessary risks because if I get an injury it'll take a little longer to heal, and I don't want it to keep me out of the gym for too long, so I don't go as crazy as I used to. But use it or lose it!",

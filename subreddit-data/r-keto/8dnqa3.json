    "postText": "I'm 73, female, Atkins since the first book came out in 1972. For the past 3 years I've been strict LCHF + IF.\nHave no diseases, take no prescription drugs and have been walking 3 miles before dawn every morning for 4 years. Do yoga and swim laps. I have basically the same body shape as in '72 when I was 28 years old. \n\nNot only the body benefits from Keto and Intermittent Fasting, but the BRAIN health as well. I encourage you to take care of yourself, even while the people around you are busily scolding you and telling you your WOE will kill you. I'm still alive and running around all healthy while others my age are riding scooters in the super market.\n\nWe are the next wave of good health. Read the works of Drs. Dale Bredesen, Jason Fung, and others who are doing all they can to overcome the obesity/diabesity epidemic.\n[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/X0O6izn.jpg)\n\n",

Get low carb peanut butter and sit and eat it with hubby. \n\nFirst make sweetened condensed milk\n\n2 cups heavy whipping cream\n\n2 tb unsalted butter\n\n1/3 cup sweetener (I used confectioners swerve)\n\nPut it all in a saucepan, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer about 20 minutes until big bubbles are visible.\n\nThis makes about 1 and 1/3 cup of condensed milk.\n\nNext make the fudge:\n\n1/2 cup of the condensed milk \n\n\u00a01 3 oz bar of lilys dark chocolate (or 1/2 cup of lilys chocolate chips)\n\nPut both in a microwave safe bowl and microwave in 10 second increments and stir until smooth. (I made mine directly after making the condensed milk so it was warm enough to melt the chocolate without microwaving) \n\nI poured mine into a wax paper lined loaf pan. Put it in the freezer and it was set in less than 20 minutes. I cut it into 14 pieces. \n\nUsing cronometer the nutrition info turns out to be per square:\n\n97 kcal\n\n.4 protein\n\n1.9 carbs\n\n9.5 fat\n\nRecipe gotten from:\n\nhttps://mymontanakitchen.com/2016/11/11/2-ingredient-fudge-low-carb-sugar-free-thm-s/\n\n",

My only regret is that I didn't start it sooner... and , since I live in NY, I miss bagels and pizza lol. But Overall, it's been great. I started about 5 weeks ago or so, and I'm down about 15lbs. 6'3\" male, 180lbs starting, 165 now. I was never FAT, I was more skinny-fat, but now I'm definitely on the lean side and I just keep on going. Soon, I may increase my calorie intake and try to build some muscle. And honestly, even with the pizza cravings, they're not that bad. I mean, I kinda miss it, but I really don't because I don't crave food as much anymore. Like, I was at an event a few weeks ago at a brewery where pizza was served. It was hard turning down beer and pizza, but it was definitely much more doable than previous diets I've tried. For some reason, the strict-ness of the diet seems to work in my favor. Like other diets that encourage a cheat meal usually don't work for me because then \"cheat meal\" becomes \"cheat weekend\" and it just snowballs. Granted, I don't deprive myself, I will cheat, in the sense that I'll go out with friends or my boyfriend to eat, but I'll just keep it keto when I do (burger, no bun).  ",

When I started researching keto, one thing that struck me was the epilepsy connection, as the medicine I had been prescribed for bipolar was originally developed for seizure disorders. \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udca1\n\nWithin months of starting keto, I  was not only losing weight. I was able to stop the following: 2 prescriptions for high blood pressure, 2 meds for bipolar and depression, and halved my prescription for thyroid. No longer borderline diabetic. No longer exhausted. My body does not constantly ache.\n\n My mind is my own again. \n\nI'm not a medical professional, but holy crap I'm absolutely a believer and devout follower of this lifestyle.

First, it burns what you ate, and after that it goes for the stored fat.\n\nThe Fung blog has all the info from years ago, and is free and searchable. Very good search engine.",

I had a myriad of health problems in 2005-2007 and once I found keto by accident- within 30 days my body started changing. \n\nKeto was a lifestyle and I don\u2019t remember a lot of how I ate or what I did- except my meals were mostly lean meats, veggies, sugar free and low carb. It was second nature. Somehow I deviated and it escalated and I\u2019ve seen the return to poor health and symptoms with it! \n\nThis last year I had symptoms return that had been gone since 2007!!! That\u2019s when I knew I needed to go back to keto. But it\u2019s like learning to ride a bike all over again, but I can\u2019t wait to get back sailing along and have it be my lifestyle. I was beyond energetic and bright and focused the years I was on keto. I\u2019ve become a couch potato with no focus since deviating back to a SAD diet. \n\nLesson learned. Keto made me feel alive. And my health was spectacular. I never took a sick day. I slept great. I earned four college degrees and ran marathons and did so much that requires so much energy and stamina. And then POW. \n\nNight and day. \n\nBlessed to see your decades of eating this way. That\u2019s what I yearn for again! ",

Fought a crippling sugar addiction my whole like until I stumbled across a mention of keto about 10 years ago, and have not looked back.  Those bastard lobbyists and George McGovern all deserve to roast in the lowest circle of hell for the mis-service they performed society by promoting carbs and demonizing fats.  Wandering around any city in North and Central America the obvious effects of carbohydrate consumption, and in particular HFCS, makes one want to weep.  And that's just what we can see, as OP points out there are far reaching effects on the body in general.\n\nPictures of of people from the 50s and 60s tell such a different story of normal life back then, even the so-called fat kid at school was skinny by today's standards.  And black girls were slim, none of that big booty that today is *considered* to be attractive.\n\nKeto isn't for everyone -- for example I find it too hard to maintain -- but even just following a low carb diet (approx 30 grams of carb/day, vs. &lt; 10g for keto) has a host of benefits the least of which is weight control that is literally a no brainer, as in I have to remind myself consume enough calories sometimes.  Unfortunately the medical community is not on board at all.\n\nEven if you do nothing but remove HFCS from your diet you will have benefits, but cutting way down on carbs is a whole other level of goodness.  Dr. Lustig's lecture on why HFCS is NOT the same as sugar (glucose) is eye opening https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM -- don't let the length put you off, you can skip to about 1:10 and he summarizes his findings, but if you have the time the whole lecture is fascinating and informative.",

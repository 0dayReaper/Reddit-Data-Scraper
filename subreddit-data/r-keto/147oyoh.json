    "postText": "I was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia a few years ago, which basically means I\u2019m constantly tired and they don\u2019t know why. I was on stimulants for that and ADHD. My first week of keto, the stimulants were too much. After the third night of not sleeping, I went off them and I\u2019ve been off them for 5 weeks. My excessive daytime sleepiness is almost gone. I still get tired but nothing like before, and I don\u2019t have a lot of trouble concentrating. \n\nI told my sleep doc and he was receptive to me going off the stimulants. I still have what they call sleep inertia, meaning it\u2019s extremely hard to wake and get going, and I can sleep for 12+ hours if I\u2019m not careful. But losing the daytime sleepiness is great. \n\nI was tested for food intolerances, allergies, hormones, thyroid, vitamin deficiencies, etc. to find the cause of the fatigue, with no real answers. My diet before this wasn\u2019t good, but I wasn\u2019t prediabetic (had blood sugar tested). I do have CPTSD so I\u2019m sure lifelong stress contributes, but I have that largely managed after years of therapy. \n\nAnyway I just wanted to put this out there if anyone is in a similar situation. I saw a post about IH from a few years ago but nothing recent and it didn\u2019t mention sleep inertia. I started keto for weight loss and this isn\u2019t my first time on the diet, but it\u2019s the first time since my diagnosis/stimulants so I\u2019m paying better attention. I find it very interesting and I wonder what the science behind it is, but seems like keto hasn\u2019t been studied enough for an answer.\n\nAlso if anyone has sleep inertia and has any keto related advice that helped them, I\u2019d appreciate it!",

I try to go for 3 mile walks every morning when I wake up. The combination of getting some vitamin d and your brain getting lots of sunlight and activity helps with your circadian rhythm. \n\nIf I sit inside all day and do nothing, I won't fall asleep till 2 or 3 am, then I will just be a zombie the next day. \n\nIt sucks at first, but once you get into the habit you will sleep better and wake up more alert.",

I find I have a lot less EDS and sleep attacks and can manage my narcolepsy with a nap a day/good sleep hygiene vs insane amounts of sleep. I also have almost zero sleep inertia now which is a fucking miracle. No idea why it works either but I feel you.",

I was popping up out of bed without issue for a while and went, oh, wow, I actually feel good? I\u2019ve been strict keto since February and I\u2019ve been good for about 2 months so I\u2019d say about 2-3 months in? It used to be really bad in the mornings, I would wake up feeling drunk but now I\u2019m consistently getting up at 6 with very little issue. I do still have it sometimes if I nap for too long so I have to set a few timers to make sure I get up but otherwise it\u2019s a big difference. \n\nA while ago someone posted about a link about gluten being a big narcolepsy trigger so I also went gluten free. Apparently in some people in can exacerbate EDS symptoms? Idk, it\u2019s mostly trial and error at this point but keto is working for me. I have a big chunk of my life back.",

I just went down a rabbit hole of histamines and gluten and carbs and it seems like the science is maybe getting there about how everything is connected. It\u2019s hard for me to say what is causing my symptoms. I also have IBS and I haven\u2019t tried low-FODMAP, though what I eat in keto mostly is (that wasn\u2019t planned). So it could be gluten, could be some other carb, could be a histamine reaction to said carbs. I see what you mean about trial and error.",

            "comment": "Not keto related, but have you tried sleeping during the day and being awake at night? You may just have a different sleep schedule.\n\nAs a night owl myself, I feel out of phase with my body if I have to conform to a \"normal\" schedule (such as if I'm on a trip). My normal sleep is to go to bed around sunrise and wake up about 6 hours later in the midafternoon. I'm at my best from midnight to 4am, I can handle the most complex tasks then.\n\nI am extremely familiar with sleep inertia. The only time I don't experience it is when I'm doing the night owl schedule. Some friends came to visit over the Memorial Day weekend holiday and I was basically jetlagged like a zombie. It's still screwing with me although they've been gone over a week now. \n\nA statistically significant number of people are just hardwired to be up at night. This isn't a disorder, it's how humans have evolved to be able to survive through the night when predators would have been lurking. Someone's gotta watch the flocks and tend the fires. That would have been my job back then. \n\nI also have ADHD. I use coffee to manage it, and have made habits to help (always put my keys in the same place, for example). So far the coffee has been enough. Weirdly, caffeine from sodas has a different effect, maybe there's something else in coffee that works together as a more holistic \"medicine\". \n\nI'm currently not on keto (trying low carb, it's not working for me, I need to get back to it). When I was doing the keto diet I noticed a huge difference in my ability to focus and think. \n\nI had been suffering from Long Covid for a couple years and keto really helped with the inflammation and I was feeling more like myself and had way more energy than before. I am also a middle aged (53) woman with some thyroid issues so it was hard to say what menopause and thyroid brought to the table. \n\nI started keto in October of 2021 and tried to keep it clean, and not eating a ton of dietary fat other than EVOO, avocados, and nuts. Some heavy cream and some cheese, but keeping the dairy fats in check. I definitely noticed a difference when I took my vitamins too, especially vitamin D, which I was deficient in. Viruses will strip you of your fat stored vitamins really quickly, so if you've been sick, check your vitamins with a blood test and suppliment anything you need to. \n\nGot Covid again about this time last year, which wrecked my eating habits. Then for the past year I just haven't been able to stick with keto. (Maybe today is the day to try again?) It's messed up my sleep and left me with this low level fatigue/almost depression that just sucks. My partner isn't that interested in doing keto again so it's hard to stay on it. \n\nSo this doesn't really answer your question but it's possibly tangental. On keto things just fell in line and I felt way better, had more brain cells firing together, slept much better. Some of it was probably due to inflammation and insulin/thyroid issues that keto is great at managing. I've gained some of the weight back and it's starting to really affect my life, so I am going to do keto again. \n\nI hope you are able to get your sleep sorted out. It really affects your whole body. Best wishes.",

I quit my 9-5 career, took the 60% pay cut, and got a job that finishes around 3am. Life changing.\n\nYep, the pay sucks, but being fired for being late, forcing myself to sleep with benzos, antihistamines. Falling asleep on public transit and waking up somewhere random etc.  Just wasn't worth it.\n\nI manage my ADHD with ephedrine, btw. Amphetamines give me too many side effects as well.",

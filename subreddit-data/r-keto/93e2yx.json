    "postText": "Today is my 1 year Keto anniversary! 111 lbs gone total (lost 60 previously through low cal diet and exercise. [pics](https://imgur.com/gallery/PRFFTUu)\n\nI can\u2019t even begin to explain the ways in which Keto has changed my life over the past year. I was fat and miserable and working at a job I hated.  I had also been struggling with IBS for over 15 years and was borderline high BP and diabetic. I have two boys who were 3 and 8 months when I decided to give Keto a try for health reasons in addition to weightloss. \n\nJust a year later and I\u2019m \u201cnormal\u201d weight range for the first time since I was about 14 years old. My IBS is almost entirely resolved (still some issues related to gallbladder removal). Last month I reapplied for life insurance and qualified for top tier. I\u2019m in perfect health! I\u2019m 6 weeks out from running my first half-marathon. I quit my day job and make a living weightloss coaching people with my program and website. Can\u2019t wait to see what the next year brings! \n\nBecause I know you\u2019ll ask, I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d and yes I have a ton of extra skin. \n\nFollow my story in detail on Instagram @losermentality\n\nSW:260/CW:149/GW:?\n ",

Keep up the hard work and best of luck on the half marathon! \n\nIf loose skin is a concern, check out autophagy, which literally means self-eating. When fasting for certain periods of time, the body/cells can eat away the bad stuff (excess skin). \n\nThere's a great post on it autophagy as it specifically relates to loose skin [here:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1727118407578508/permalink/1797358973887784/) Not sure if links are allowed, the group is private so you might have to ask to join. \n\nAnother good post on autophagy in general can be found [here:] (https://besynchro.com/blogs/blog/the-profound-benefits-of-fasting-and-autophagy)",

For a while it made it worse. I started keto mainly for its anti-inflammatory response in the body, hoping that would help and it has! It was an adjustment at first and I experienced a lot of diarrhea when others would be having constipation.  I also wrongly was taking in too much fat in the beginning.  I now eat high protein, as low of fat as possible and under 20 carbs a day.  There are a few items like alcohol that still cause IBS issues but other than that I feel amazing!",

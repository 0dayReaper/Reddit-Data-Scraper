    "postText": "Stats:\n\n29M, 5\u201910, 81kg, approx 24% bf. I walk between 12-15k steps a day and go to the gym 5-6 times a week (no heavy lifting as recovering from an injury atm)\n\nI\u2019ve been doing keto for a few months now and have lost around 3-4kgs. I\u2019m not massively overweight, but wouldn\u2019t mind shedding a few kgs. However, I\u2019m mainly doing keto for other benefits.\n\nCurrently I\u2019m eating on average 1700 kcals a day (120g protein, less than 20g net carbs and fat to satiety). According to the keto calculator referenced in this subreddit a number of times (ankerl), for a 20% deficit, I should be eating less than 1550 kcals which seems like awfully too little.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m making this post is because I recently came across a post where a 5\u20198 male was being told that they weren\u2019t eating enough protein and should get in at least 170g! Now I\u2019m basing my splits off of the widely accepted 1.8-2.2g/kg of lean body mass which would mean I should eat between 110-135g of protein. Am I getting in enough calories and protein a day?",

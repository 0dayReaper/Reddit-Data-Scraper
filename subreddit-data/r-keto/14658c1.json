    "postText": "My current keto diet consists of no dairy, gluten, soy, peanuts, beef, eggs or stevia yet my skin is breaking out quite a bit. I have no idea why this could be happening given that i am trying to avoid processed meats as well. \n\nMy drinks and meals usually consist of matcha latte with coconut cream or stir fry with spinach, low carb vegetables and pork, chicken or seafood using lard or duck fat, maybe one slice of Keto bread and keto clusters as a snack.\n\nI l feel like the moment I go back to carbs my skin gets better but it makes no sense to me and would rather stay on keto for cognitive enhancement. \n\nI even stopped eating Pork rinds thinking it could be the culprit but still breaking out. \n\nDid anybody experience the same and managed to fix it? What was the cause?",

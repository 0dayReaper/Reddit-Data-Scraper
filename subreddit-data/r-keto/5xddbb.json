You cut out sugar in fruits as well, but you subtract the fiber. An apple isn't very keto friendly at 25g of carbs, but has 4.4 g of fiber, so net carbs are 20. If you go below 20 g of carbs you'll hit ketosis in about 1 to 3 days.\n\nSome people will go into ketosis then slowly add more carbs to see there limit, using something like ketostix. Some people will drop out at 50g of carbs, some 30 some 90. \n\nThe other thing is that you can go into ketosis through exercise. Most people don't get there unless they are extreme athletes, so fewer carbs still helps here.\n\nGoing into ketosis can be a little unpleasant. After about a day and a half i got the keto flu and felt sick for about another day and half, then still felt a little groggy for about a week but came out better on the other end and feeling great. \n\nI've been on keto for about 6 weeks. First 3 weeks I dropped 15 lbs.  But that is considered the honeymoon period. Since you lose a lot of water weight since carbs retain more water. Then I played for about a week and half. Then I've lost another, so about 25 lbs in 6 weeks.  Pretty good considering I eat 2+lbs of bacon a week, as well as steak, burger, chicken, etc.",

You must be consistent and disciplined.  You also have to check food labels, and become more educated about what contains carbs, as well as select brands/version which have fewer carbs (i.e. not all cheese in the same).\n\nCan you consistently control what types of foods you eat?  Are you willing to cut sugars and starches?  Are you willing to avoid breads, candy, chips, pasta, rice, doughnuts, etc?  \n\nI mean, it's really a question of whether you're willing to do it ... versus \"but I want to eat sugar and do keto\" ... which obviously doesn't work.\n\nThere are a lot of tasty foods though you can eat on keto including various meats, cheeses, butter, veggies, eggs, and more.\n\n&gt;  is there a starter kit available somewhere? \n\nProbably, but they're probably also a giant waste of time and money.\n\nThe diet is basically medium-high fat is fine, medium protein, as close to zero carbs as possible (below 20 grams per day ideal).\n\n&gt; Does all sugars include fruit like apples?\n\nYes, and apples have a lot of sugar, and very little vitamins or minerals.\n\nhttp://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fruits-and-fruit-juices/1810/2\n\nIf you start researching foods you eat in more detail, you'll realize there's a lot of misinformation out there like \"Fruits are healthy.\"  Some fruits have more nutrition than others (though, most high in carbs), and most fruits are probably better than a candy bar ... but not much much.  There are some good links on the sidebar, and feel free to ask around if you have questions.\n\n",

If you walk down a street with only 20 people on it, the chances of you physically bumping into someone else are very slim. If you walk down a street with 2,000 people on it, that chance increases exponentially. And the problem isn't prisons incentivising crime. It's what constitutes a crime in the different countries. America does not have very lax drug related laws, for instance. Whereas you might get away with carrying a bag of weed around in your backpack in some other country, that same thing will land you in prison here. Most of the criminals rotting in our prisons are there because of drugs. ",

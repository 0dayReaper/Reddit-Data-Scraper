Carbs have an electrolytic effect and after the initial glucose flush you\u2019ll need to preserve that effect from the constant turnover of glucose that slows down quite a bit on keto. \n\nThis loss of water also relates to fatigue and also will see a drop in weight you can lift. Figure 5% drop almost immediately. If it\u2019s more than that you\u2019re electrolytes are off.",

            "comment": "Make sure you drink ketoade while playing football (and other times too), but don\u2019t chug it or you\u2019ll upset your stomach.\n\nYou still will struggle playing for a while, but if you don\u2019t keep up on our recommendations for electrolytes you straight up will be unable to play.\n\nKeep up some amount of lifting and eat adequate protein and you shouldn\u2019t lose much muscle at all. That\u2019s the main purpose of using keto for a cut instead eating chicken breast and rice.\n\nEdit: also not being an irritable fuck like everyone else on a cut",

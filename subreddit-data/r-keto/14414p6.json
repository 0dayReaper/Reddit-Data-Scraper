    "postText": "Hey :) I just want to share a good feeling with you. My whole life I struggled with food and thinking very much about it, especially when stressed. But now I realized that for the last two to three weeks I accidentally do intermittent fasting for at least 16 hours and I feel great.\n\nThe best thing of keto is, not to think about food at all or when the hunger comes, it is not urgent and i do not get grumpy :D\n\nI love it. &lt;3\n\nWish you a nice rest of the week!",

My sleep dr said that's a normal response now that my brain was being oxygenated normally, and that food desires were bc my brain wanted foods with nutrients to repair the damage. What's weird is that I had been a vegetarian-then-vegan for several decades who never even liked eggs or beef before I became veg in the 1980s, yet my body wanted them?\n\nThat is how I KNOW eating keto or at least very low carb, is healthy. My body wouldn't lie now that its working right.\n\nWhat's amazing is that my brain made my body rest for a day (detoxing?) before giving me a low carb appetite.",

I'm very strict with my macros, if I go over my carbs it's 22-23g total, that's it and that's because I added more veggies. I don't have cheat meals either, I have loved the options that keto gives me! I don't do any of the keto products. I eat eggs, dairy, veggies and meat. I have a bad addiction to sugar so I've not even incorporated fruit at this point nor any of the fake sugar replacements for keto. If I'm hungry I go up on my protein and fat. If I want a snack it's Pickles or a piece of 100% cocoa. On very rare occasions I'll have 2 Tbsp Almond butter.",

There's a huge difference between being in ketosis and being fat adapted. You won't become fat adapted if you keep slipping in and out of ketosis. Stay below 20 g. for 8 weeks and don't fuck around with keto treats and snacks and fake sugars. I know lots of people can do dirty keto and lose weight, but if you want total freedom from cravings and the ability to slip into fasting easily, this is the way. Ymmv.",

Just ask nicely and say that you have dietary requirements, that need to be met. When you are fully adapted you may do not mind anymore to eat less \"fancy\" food with one ingredient. When you are very hungry on keto try to eat enough protein. That helped me alot, especially when active. And then you \"fill\" the rest of the calories with fat. Some people will say it kicks you out of ketosis when eating protein, but that was now debunked. If you are feeling sluggish eat more fat. I realized that my body can not burn my fat sooo fast, that I need some extra in my diet. And when I feel I have a slight craving I go for electrolytes. Sometimes your body is confused with the signals. After a while it will all settle. I wish you a nice day and much success!",

I get very hungry when I eat not much a few days, because I am busy and then the hunger comes with force and i eat. And with hunger I mean the thought of bland chicken is appealing hahaha. So when you experience this, maybe your body needs some more food oder some specific nutrients, for which it screams for. When it's \"real\" hunger and boring food seems very appealing, I generally trust my body and just eat and do not care about calories that day. We are no machines. And so far, it works well for me.\n\nI think the easiest way to figure out if I am really hungry is the question, which food I would eat. Is it just normal food, I am hungry. Is it something like fancy Nutella xy, I think it's some mind hunger and i need dopamine, which I then get somewhere else. :)",

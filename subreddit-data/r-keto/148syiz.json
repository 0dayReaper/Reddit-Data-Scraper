I\u2019ve read about keto and how fast it I could lose weight with it but I have no idea. I\u2019ve looking into just eating a calorie deficit but I\u2019m stuck between if I need those healthy carbs or no carbs at all.. also my maintenance calorie is roughly 2700cal",

            "comment": "Keep it under 20g of net carbs (carbs minus fiber) per day, and you should lose at least 8lbs per month, if you're active.  Don't overdo fats or proteins.  Never let yourself get hungry.  If you're hungry, fry up some bacon, eat pork rinds or cheese cubes.  Eat romaine lettuce, asparagus, pecans, avocados.  The high fat content of your diet will keep you from being hungry, and get you off the boom-bust cycle of carb hunger.  And drink a gallon of water every day.  And keep your electrolytes balanced.  For me, all I need is a multivitamin that includes potassium and magnesium, but some people need more.\n\nI stay around 1200 calories per day, and it's plenty for me.  My body gets its energy from burning through my fat stores.  It takes about a month for a body to get used to doing that.  The first week is difficult.  But after the first month, it's incredibly easy.  I have endless energy, and a constant, mild euphoria.",

            "comment": "If you're prone to overeating then keto is great because it keeps you satiated. I'll be honest, the first few days of keto suck as you're going into ketosis, but after about 3 days I feel better (increased energy, no cravings, reduced hunger). I've lost about 30lbs so far with it so for me it works, but this isn't a one size fits all diet.\n\nLike the other poster said: try it for a few weeks and you'll get a feel of whether it's for you or not. There's plenty of recipes on the internet to get you started. You could start with keeping below 50g carbs per day and see how that is. Most people say to stay below 20g although if you're new to keto this may be difficult. My meals mostly consist of a protein and a non starchy vegetable to bulk out the meal, then a keto dessert (chocolate Greek yoghurt ice lollys are my current favourite). Hope this helps :)\n\nEdit: spelling.",

There are also essential fats (specifically LA and ALA) fats we must eat to remain healthy. There's also vitamins and minerals that we must get via our food because otherwise our bodies can't make them from other nutrients/minerals/chemicals we eat.\n\nBut there are NO carbs we have to eat to stay healthy.\n\nCertain cells in our bodies do require glucose, however, these cells are so vital to survival that our bodies have more than one pathway to make the required glucose from whatever food we eat. Again, NO carbs are actually necessary.",

    "postText": "5 days or so on keto and I feel okay-ish but it\u2019s just that I feel weird in the sense that my mental thoughts are very high paced to the point where it\u2019s borderline uncomfortable. I feel like my flight or fight is much more activated. I simply do not know what to do with all of this energy. I do exercise on-and-off but on my off days I can\u2019t really relax. The moment I relax the mind instantly resorts to \u201cwhat do I do next? What\u2019s the next thing to do? Do something! Move move move!\u201d And it\u2019s like I\u2019m on cocaine or something. \n\nKeto does give me better concentration and clarity but it almost feels like it\u2019s giving me ADHD symptoms in a way, like they\u2019re much more intense because my mind is going back and fourth like a ping pong ball if that makes sense. \n\nI\u2019m still going to maintain keto because I genuinely hate sugar and carbs to an extent and keto is what they say, \u201chealthy\u201d, so I\u2019ll keep at it. But I was just wondering if anyone else experiences this. Even when I talk to people I feel annoying because my mind is going so high paced I even talk very fast and people can\u2019t understand me at times. That normal too?",

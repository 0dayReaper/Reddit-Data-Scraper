    "postText": "I struggle trying to reach the protein and fat macros, especially during weekdays at work. I am in endless meetings and barely have time to eat. I have been snacking on walnuts/almonds in between but I can\u2019t meet the numbers. I am also on Mounjaro for T2D and that may be suppressing my appetite as well. Should I try something like Keto Chow or do you have any different tips on reaching these daily goals? TIA",

            "comment": "You don't have to meet the fat macro as long as you're not eating so little you're not getting enough essential fatty acids or your calorie count is way too low. Like a long-term deficit of more than 20-25% is not ideal for sustained weight loss because you're going to be losing too much lean weight, and if you're trying to maintain weight then you have a narrower and higher calorie range to work with. \n\nFor the nutrition part, it's pretty hard to follow a keto diet and *not* get minimum fat requirements. Missing necessary fats is mostly a problem for people attempting a low-fat diet.",

The two important things are to limit carbs (watch portions on those nuts - the carbs and calories add up fast) and prioritize protein.  Design your meals around meat/fish/poultry,  even if it is just cold cuts taken from meeting lunch platters, or bunless burgers from a local fast food joint.  It should be the star, with a few vegetables.  I treat non-meat foods as \"dessert,\" if I am still hungry after I finish the meat on my plate.",

You don\u2019t need to focus on meeting a fat macro goal, it just fills in between carbs and protein.",

A shake can be made the day before and kept in your fridge overnight. Bring it to work the next day, keep it in your office fridge if you have one, then drink it for lunch. It's designed to provide 1/3 of adult daily requirement of vitamins, nutrients and protein...all you do is add a fat to bring it up to your whatever your lunch macros are for fat and calories, and add a liquid component. You do need to add a fat because there are some fat-soluble vitamins in Keto Chow that your body needs to absorb.",

LA and ALA are essential polyunsaturated fats you must eat.\n\nFats are required in order to absorb fat soluble vitamins in your food like vitamins A, D, E and K. \n\nThat being said, a few things. (1) it's ok to safely fast and not eat anything. If you're not eating any food at all, you don't need fat to absorb vitamins you're not eating (2) there's fat in most foods, so I'm not saying you need to add fat like butter to your intake. Even things like broccoli get something like 10% of their calories from fat. (3) short term abstaining from fat, for instance if you're doing something like PSMF for 30 days, is also ok. You won't have long term issues doing that. (4) if you're trying to lose weight, the goal is for a significant portion of your body's caloric needs to come from your own fat cells, that's why we eat in a deficit, to force our bodies to use those cells for fuel. That's another reason you may not need to add fats like butter to your food -- because you want your body to turn to your fat cells as much as possible.\n\nBut, to repeat, you do need to eat fat.",

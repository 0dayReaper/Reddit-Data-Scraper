I have the anxiety that I will become obsessing about the food and that I will one day fear fruits or maybe something like sweet potato that\u2019s also considered healthy. I just started and yes I see big changes, but will I do it forever??\n\nAnd I am sorry: my English is not the best! :)",

            "comment": "As someone who went through a point in time where I demonized carbs and structured my way of eating around avoiding them, you are right to worry about potentially having this issue.\n\nI say to you, don't worry about it. The one thing about Keto is that once you do it, you never forget how it makes you feel both mentally and physically. It is a tool that the body knows how to use instinctively, and like the hammer everyone has in a toolbox somewhere, it is there when you need it. \n\nKeto taught me a lot about myself, my body, and the power of addiction and the strength of will it takes to break it. Keto helped me quit a 2 pack a day smoking habit, and because of Keto, I am no longer a high functioning alcoholic. \n\nKeto reset my baseline, and helped me to relearn the difference between feeling \"normal\" and feeling my best. I learned what foods make my joints hurt the next day, like potatoes. I learned that bread and pizza makes me break out in whitehead pimples on my face within 3 hours of eating them. I learned that certain \"healthy\" vegetables cause severe gastrointestinal distress when I eat them now. \n\nIf it wasn't for keto, I would never know this and would have just continued plodding along poisoning myself with cigarettes, daily drinking, and food that was causing me harm, because that was my baseline before. \n\nI learned to just be okay with breaking keto once in a while, like when my wife wants to go out to dinner and I eat sushi with her. I don't want to, but it makes her happy and I am back on track in two days. \n\nIf you want an apple, eat the damn apple. You can always get back into ketosis, but it doesn't work if you keep cycling back and forth every few days in metabolic purgatory. \n\nFor some, Keto is a way of life. For others it is a way of eating, but for everyone it is a tool that is always there when you need it.  Most importantly, Keto teaches us that there is a way to eat that allows our body and mind to operate optimally, whether you do it for a few months out of the year, or the rest of your life.",

So if someone is still in the middle of making the transition and then starts cycling carbs in and out, the mitochondria and cellular machinery never has a chance to adapt to either, and this leads to metabolic purgatory. Some people can get away with it, but most can't and this is why it is so important to give Keto at least 6 weeks to get the cellular machinery in place and up and running before cycling if it's their first time doing Keto. After that, the body has learned what to do and tends to make the switch back more easily, at least in my case.",

My daily carb limit is 20g net carbs or less per day. Going over the limit, like to 25g nc, is OK for me once in a while...it won't kick me out of ketosis or affect my glucose and A1C. Your limits might be different from mine. Good carbs like berries and some vegetables are perfectly healthy, just don't overdo them, stay within your daily carb limit and you should be fine.\n\nHere's some carb and nutrition info about sweet potatoes. You might be able to eat a small one, or half of one only occasionally, and still be OK. With butter and a little cinnamon...yum.

If it's a must have, try it for a few weeks without removing it and see if the other cravings have gone, if it's not a must or it's keeping you craving, go cold Turkey, that's how I would approach it.",

Then after I had him I was trying to eat super cheap, so carbs became a staple. And I have felt like absolute trash ever since.

I think once I get the extra weight off I will go back to eating the way I ate for the first 35 years of my life. I never even one time followed anything resembling a diet, never weighed myself, always had energy, doctor visits were always a snap and clothes shopping was a dream.

            "comment": "I am not going to do \"keto\" forever, because being in ketosis doesn't matter to me anymore.\n\nAt this point, I think what I am doing would be considered closer to a CKD (cyclical keto) than standard keto, but I don't stress over the carb count. But I would still be considered as having a very low carb diet.\n\nWhen I eat at home, it's protein, veggies, and berries for the most part. I don't buy refined grains or things with added sugar in them. I pack my lunches and cook dinner. I will make sweet potatoes on occasion, because they are yummy. I had a honeycrisp apple last week and it was tasty.\n\nWhen I eat out, I am okay with things like sweet potatoes, a bit of rice, something sweet if it seems worth it. That's usually going to be on a Thursday or Friday, and I think it's fine because  I will burn the extra carbs during my workout and subsequent ADF over the weekend.\n\nBasically, I am mindful of not eating too many carbs regularly, but I don't stress over the count anymore. I had been at a point where I was really obsessive about it, and I thought that I was on the edge of developing an eating disorder. Relaxing the \"rules\" and stopping the testing for ketosis really helped me.\n\nCarbs are not evil, they aren't \"bad\" foods, but like any good or neutral thing, it can be taken too far. I think keto is great but also can be taken too far. Everyone needs to find what works for them, and ultimately set yourself up for long-term success. Giving up watermelon, corn, bread, apples, peaches, etc. for the rest of my life isn't what is going to make me successful. What will make me successful is finding a healthy balance where I can make room for foods I enjoy without going overboard.",

There is a keto version of any food out there.  I couldnt go back to eating more carbs unless it was just more of the types of carbs I eat now.  The whole idea that it is restrictive or unsustainable is nonsense, again it's a state of mind.  The fear that you will suddenly not be able to eat those foods is from all the eating disorder warnings out there combined with weight loss advice.  In fact I can now eat those foods in moderation and not have trouble stopping eating them cuz of keto vs before theyd have sent me into a binge and I would have eaten as much as I could or believed it wasnt possible to stop.\n\nThe standard diet was not for me and it was not sustainable.  I had many issues and got diabetes.  When you eat to live vs living to eat you realize food can be just as fantastic and enjoyable maybe even more enjoyable.  I actually hate restaurant eating now and prefer making my own food.  Eating a single high quality well selected chocolate is WAY more enjoyable than mowing down on a bag of 2 dollar chocolates for example.\n\nI basically have sometimes and always foods.  I sometimes have a piece of birthday cake but it's usually a half piece or few bites and only ON family birthdays I dont always plan them out but I eat them in serving sized portions or smaller portions my sil does this and she isnt on any diet and is very healthy naturally.  Fruit and sweet potatoes are sometimes foods for me.  An always food is like eggs, meat or non starchy veg meaning I can eat it whenever I want.",

I also do intermittent fasting, and don't start eating until 1-2pm each day, usually finishing off around 8pm.\n\nIf I go to someone's house and they've prepared food that's not keto-compliant, I eat it. Most of my good friends and family know that I'm on keto, so this only happens once every few months.\n\nIf my friends want to go out to a patio and have a few beers, I don't sweat it for that one night of the month that we tend to do that. If we're having drinks at our own places, I drink vodka seltzers instead.\n\nI'm not trying to give you a system, but just show you that, within broad constraints, carbs every once in a while is harmless.\n\nFor myself, I've been doing keto and intermittent fasting for just over a year (started late April 2022). I'm down about 50lbs in that time, and I'm finally at the point where I need to really go clothes shopping. That was more or less by following what I outlined above.\n\nIf I had been super-super strict, could I have lost weight faster, even a lot faster? Probably. But I like this idea of pacing myself a bit more liberally because, as you say, hopefully this is how I'll eat for the rest of my life. Being a little relaxed compared to the most-ideal keto protocol still got me back into my high school jeans, so, you know, I'll take a bit of slack on the rope if it means something more sustainable over the long haul.",

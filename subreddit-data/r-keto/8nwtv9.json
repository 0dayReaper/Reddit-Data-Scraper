Though, I think it would have been equally doable without the slight exercise increase. \n\nA few things i incorporated to make my diet more effective were meal prepping and IF. I started a steady 16:8 everyday after a few weeks into the diet because my appetite reduction was insane. Meal prepping kept me on task and made it more effective to log macros on MFP. I attribute my current stall to be because I\u2019ve slacked severely on my meal prepping and instead will have to decide what to randomly make each night. ",

So honestly, do not worry about eating salty things.  You will need it.  You can get potassium from avacados or lite salt (50% NaCl and 50% KCl).\n\nI read 3 books on keto and only in the last one did it mention the magnesium thing.  I was taking one 400mg pill before bed.  Had a good sleep, and holy cow a good crap when I woke up.\n\nYour overall testosterone is probably low because our very high amount of bodyfat concerts it into estrogen.  So you could also talk to Doctors about your testosterone and estrogen levels.  Taking an anti estrogen made a world of an emotional difference for me.  I am now much more steady and less freaking out at myself about every dam thing.  It's slowly causing me to rethink everything about my life, why I do things for pleasure and what it really accomplishes.\n\nWelcome to the start of your journey.  It won't be quick, just don't give up.",

While it's not in any way impossible to get magnesium, potassium etc on a keto diet, in the first week or two you lose loads of it as you lose water weight, so supplements are recommended. And as another poster said, SALT ALL THE THINGS! If you don't already have liteSalt (or mineral salt, it goes by different names), go buy it. That's salt with added potassium which you'll need. I usually salt my foods with both regular and litesalt :)\n\nAlso, a totally not mandatory but possibly useful supplement is hydrolyzed collagen which is great for your skin (I've used it myself so I know it works) and will stop it from becoming saggy. As you lose loads of weight fast, that's otherwise a problem a lot of people have - they look good with clothes on, but the skin sags! Now, you're young so your skin should adapt eventually anyway but hydrolyzed collagen may help :)",

I don't weigh myself, only get weighed when I have a doctor appointment so I can't give you a completely accurate weight that I am now.  My last appointment was at the end of February and after a little over 4 months I was already down to 419.  I have continued to lose a massive amount of weight, and can't seem to stay at a size long enough to buy clothes that will continue to fit for more than a couple of weeks.  (lol not that I am complaining!)\n\nSo, with you being a young man still, and on the right track already, I am absolutely positive that if you stick with it, the future is yours!  \n\nThere will be some rough times here and there, just remember to eat enough, don't go crazy on the protein because it will slow down weight loss a lot if you get too much, and don't beat yourself up if you make a mistake, mistakes happen.  Hell, I accidentally knocked myself out of keto a few times.  \n\nP.S.  I know you are a young man, and this one may be difficult, but avoid alcohol as much as you possibly can.  There is a good chance that it will throw off your system like crazy, and kick you out of Ketosis even if you are well below your daily Carb limit.  ",

The great thing about Keto is that once you train the body to convert fat into fuel, your body fat becomes an oil well. As a result that usually means you're also less hungry because your body's snacking on your fat, thus you can have large caloric deficits and still feel fine. As long as you make sure to get in your essential vitamins and nutrients, and listen to your body, you're golden.",

It always comes back but also always goes away when keto. Has anyone experienced this and maybe have a thought of what is going on? I\u2019m am scheduling a dermatologist appt but wanted to send a feeler out. Thanks!",

Don't use anything like cotton tipped swabs (q-tips) they won't clean it out.\n\nEdit: removing wheat from my diet helped clear the psoriasis. Full on keto and I'm down to a few small spots. Better clearing than any med I used.",

Yup, this was the picture that took my breath away, made me stop and seriously reevaluate where my health was.   I can still feel the sensation of being packed into that swing seat, most of me squooshing out around and almost not being able to click the buckle in front of me.   I remember trying to smile and have fun with my son, but beating myself up on the inside for being so big.   When I saw this pic later, the physical sensations and the mental turmoil kind of fused together into my WTF?!? moment of clarity.   \n\nI have come to a point in my journey where I am comfortable sharing it.   Only very close family members have seen it.   I consider this forum very much like family or maybe a very supportive friend.   I come here every day and find info, support and a sense of community.   \n\nI have chosen Keto as a way of life.  I chose to be healthy and so much more content with myself.  Thanks for the support.   My hope is that this post helps just one person turn toward the healthy path and KCKO!!",

For me, what helped most was to overcompensate on fat -- macadamia nuts and bulletproof coffee to name just two hacks -- such that I could not even think of eating anything else, to include sweets. In less than a week, I was able to dial down the quantity of fat, and still stare-down sugar. Progress! I'm on week 5 now feeling much, much healthier. However, yesterday I took a swan dive into a peach cobbler with ice cream and pizza. Felt like I had poisoned myself. Ugh. So, as unwise as it was to eat that crap, it was a good stepping stone to experience the body's sudden response to it as opposed to a steady, incoming stream of that poison into my system. It is poison.",

                    "comment": "I\u2019m male, at the same age and similar starting weight (plus 20lbs or so). All my life I\u2019ve struggled with weight. My dad used to take me to a dietician when I was still in primary school. That didn\u2019t work.\n\nYou said you\u2019re reading, so I guess you\u2019re also not dissimilar to me in that respect. So forgive me for the unsolicited advice, but Gary Taubes\u2019s latest really shifted something in my head. I started keto on 18 May and I haven\u2019t had a single urge since then. I\u2019ve dropped about 30 lbs, but I wasn\u2019t really caring too much about quantity. Over the last few days, Ive switched it to eating in a small 4 hour window in the evening and the weight is shifting more quickly. I\u2019m not sure I would\u2019ve been able to start off this way, but it\u2019s easy now.\n\nTaubes advises making a full-hearted commitment over a longer period than most would consider. I chose 6 months. Regardless of what happened, I wasn\u2019t going to back off before December. Now, I don\u2019t plan to back off ever again in my life. Taubes also points out that what got us this fat was simply putting the wrong fuel in the tank. Once this is properly accepted, it also seems to make life a lot easier. I don\u2019t eat carbs because they don\u2019t agree with me. Pretty much the same reason I steer clear of crack cocaine, although I hear that its users say it\u2019s great and hard to give up!\n\nI now genuinely believe that there is no such thing as sugar addiction - although this may just be me playing with words. What I mean is that there is just the body\u2019s need for energy that it can process and keep us alive. Some of us have bodies that can\u2019t process sugar and other carbs very effectively. Unfortunately, we live in cultures where sugar and other carbs are plentiful, but also sold as good foods. We eat them, but our body doesn\u2019t have the ability to process them for energy, so it just stockpiles the energy they contain and keeps looking for energy to keep us alive. Which we call hunger. So we go and find more energy, and, inevitably, it\u2019s going to be the same sort of energy that is found everywhere we look - carb based chunks of energy that we put into our body and then can\u2019t process. Which leaves us hungry. Which sends us off...\n\nSo it\u2019s not sugar addiction - it\u2019s just a normal human physiological need for energy to power the heart, the brain, the limbs etc. but which we address by putting the wrong fuel in the tank. Put the write fuel in the tank and watch the body thank you for it. Protein first, fat second, healthy nutrient packed carbs like the petrol additives that you can pay a little extra for in the filling station (chia seeds, nut butters, nuts, spinach, auber...*eggplant*...courge...*zucchini*...pumpkin seeds, every now and then some raspberries, even more rarely some *whisper it* **blueberries**. \n\nYou literally can\u2019t fail. Because there\u2019s nothing to fail. There\u2019s just you consuming fuel that makes you feel full and satisfied. Now you\u2019ll have energy. Now you\u2019ll start to weigh less. And by the time you\u2019re 51, you\u2019re going to look like you\u2019re 41 and feel like you\u2019re 21. And you will enjoy yourself along the way as familiar bulges just disappear, and how clothes suddenly fit entirely differently, and how people suddenly start complimenting you, and how you will be able to do things that you hadn\u2019t thought possible, and when you realise that you are **not** naturally big, you were just eating the wrong fuel! And this isn\u2019t schmaltzy inspiration talk - this is a hard and fast guarantee: you are going to lose loads and loads of weight. Maybe not as much as you\u2019d like, maybe more...there\u2019s an element of lottery to this! But you **are** going to lose a lot of weight and at some point you might just stop caring how much because you are so relieved and so pleased to be eating food that you enjoy and that your body knows how to process. \n\nSo...don\u2019t be scared of failing. THere\u2019s really...*really*...No. Such. Thing. This group of people here is amazing, and the success stories are absurdly edifying!",

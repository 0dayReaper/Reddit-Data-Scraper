    "postText": "I'm a thin woman that is using the diet for ADHD instead of jumping on the Ritalin bandwagon, BUT I would love to gain weight.\n\nA couple challenges are that I can't eat soy, peanuts, eggs, protein powder (they break me out) or dairy due to allergies. \n\nIs there anything that worked out for you to gain weight? I get that this is the opposite that most want to do with the diet.",

Add butter to your food. If you drink coffee heavy cream. If you can drink food it\u2019s easier to consume more. \n\nBut you want the mass you add to be primarily muscle and that means some kind of resistance training is key. Even Pilates is sufficient to build muscle.",

Protein is limited in terms of both what you can utilise  and what's palatable (the 0.8g to 1.8g per kg range as a goal for most).  So realistically most of the extra calories to play with are going to be in the fats.\n\nFats outside of dairy are going to.be olive oil, coconut oil and maybe some of the more expensive ones such as macademia or avocado oils.\n\nCoconut oil is the most palatable as a flavour to me, I like roasting veg with it.\n\nIf your protein is generally lean, look to fattier cuts.  Belly pork is a god tier food when properly roasted with a nice crackling skin and it's ridiculously high fat.",

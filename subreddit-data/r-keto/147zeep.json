    "postText": "Hey guys! Really new to keto. I have a question about appetite. I\u2019m really not hungry today and didn\u2019t eat all my protein, fats or reach my calorie limit. Is it okay to not reach all of those if I\u2019m not hungry? Or should I still try to reach my protein and fat intake? Thank you!",

I think some folks have a harder time because the emotional part of the brain makes you think you want or need food when you don't. If you go back to a primal way of thinking (food for survival) and eat a proper macro balance, you will find that you body needs less than you think. Hydration is the most important part over food though. Make sure to stay hydrated and get enough electrolytes.",

            "comment": "Keto + fasting is a good combination. You're constantly burning fats for fuel, so there will be days when your own bodyfat is sufficient.\n\nJust remember, if you do eat food, try to eat at the proper ratios (75% fats, 20% protein, 5% carbs).\n\nFor example: If you're not hungry after \"lunch\", your dinner should be some nuts, cheese, and maybe some meat. Your dinner **shouldn't** be only (for example) vegetables &amp; fruits. A single meal with too many carbs can push you out of ketosis.\n\n**Another tip:** if you're not too hungry, but there's not \"substantial\" fats, remember mayo-based condiments &amp; olive oil-based dressings are basically pure fat. Ex: You **need** a small meal and you haven't eaten any fiber. Try 100g of carrots or some peppers, with chipotle-mayo dip, or chicken-breast &amp; cauliflower with balsamic dressing. Both of those have plenty of fats, moderate protein, and almost zero net carbs.\n\nSo eating less calories is 100% ok, just try to maintain the same keto ratios.\n\nGood job at starting keto. Most ppl fail, so ask for help if you run into problems.\n\nDM me if you wanna chat.",

            "comment": "1. Consuming fat on Keto is optional. Not required. If you're obese and are doing keto to lose weight, then your body will get the fat it needs from within. You do not need to reach your fat macros each day, or at all, to reach/maintain ketosis.\n2. If you aren't hungry then do not eat. That's a nice little perk of keto. It helps make fasting easier. Be advised though, extreme caloric deficits now might come back to haunt you later on with extreme hunger and cravings. Our bodies have a nasty little way of doing that to us, and I think its pretty common for a lot of long term ketoers.\n3. You should always try to hit your minimum protein goal. That's the one thing you should be aiming to hit each day. Foods like chicken, tuna, and protein powders are easy ways to get high amounts of protein at a minimal amount of calories.",

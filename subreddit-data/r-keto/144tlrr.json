I would like suggestion on how I can hit the required daily fiber intake and what veggies or fruits might take to meet this requirement. Thanks!!",

I believe it\u2019s still true that most research findings in medicine or later shown to be false. Certainly, that was the case a few decades ago and I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s changed. I think it\u2019s really about going with the preponderance of high-quality studies once enough of them have been done. Until then\u2026 really tough to know if these sorts of things hold up when they first come out. Of course I realize you know a lot more about that research than I do at this point so\u2026 I\u2019m not saying it wrong.",

Just as everyone is saying, Keto was torture until I sorted out my electrolytes - sip ketoaid w/ sodium (salt) and potassium (salt substitute), and take magnesium (2,000 mg/day for me). \n\nHang in there and keep us posted!",

    "postText": "Just got my lipid panels back and I am a bit confused. I had been on a ketogenic diet for a few months and then added more carbs around training cycles because my athletic performance dwindled. But my cholesterol is high now, and I am wondering if it's concerning? My numbers :\n\nTotal cholesterol: 228 mg/dL\n\nTriglycerides: 62 mg/dL\n\nVLDL Cholesterol Cal: 11 mg/dL\n\nLDL, Calculated: 126 mg/dL\n\nHDL Cholesterol: 91 mg/dL\n\nTwo years ago, when I was honestly way less healthy, I was drinking alcoholically and my diet was mostly takeout, my levels were:\n\nTotal cholesterol: 169 mg/dL\n\nTriglycerides: 165 mg/dL\n\nHDL Cholesterol: 68 mg/dL\n\nLDL Cholesterol calculated: 68 mg/dL\n\nAny interpretations would be greatly appreciated. I am super worried now that I am going to have some sort of heart related issue, like a stroke or clot or something. I exercise A LOT, basically training 2-3 hours 4-5x a week and active rest days. Thank you!",

I've heard that the ldl-c numbers usually shoot up higher during weight loss and tend to stabilize after 8 or more months of stable weight.\n\nEdit: also, your ldl-c number on your lipid profile is just an estimation using the Friedewald equation, which is less accurate at lower triglycerides numbers.",

I suspect you've seen a significant drop in your BMI (I know, a misguided measure... but often correlated with a jump in cholesterol on keto... Google \"lean mass hyper responder\").\n\nBelieve me it's taken me a while to get comfortable with my increased cholesterol total.  I've spent many many hours reading and watching about this subject.  If you're like me you'll need to do your own research, but I CERTAINLY encourage you to do so before bailing on your diet.  Again, you've got great numbers here.\n\nLots of people will have places to start an investigation, but a relatively easy read for me was \"The Clot Thickens.\"",

Nothing to worry about though. But, my body fat % definitely went down regardless, I pretty much entirely recomped my body in the past two years.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nFor me, just taking 2 tea spoons of himalayan sea salt per day isn't enough, I feel very weak, almost as if I will faint from just walking.\n\nI need about 4 - 5 teaspoons, is this okay to take that much daily? How do I know if I have taken too much? Do any of you guys need that much?\n\nI am fairly active, it's also getting hot here (summer). I have also been on keto for about 3 months now.\n\nThanks",

Many people have less of an appetite after a few weeks on keto and may be prone to eat much less. At first you get a big energy boost from mobilizing fat reserves, but then you get efficient and if there are not enough calories coming in, you will feel it. Once or twice a month I do a 36-hour water fast and get weak after about 24 hours with just light exercise.",

Its good with a side salad or green veggie. \nEdit:  if you don\u2019t like green pepper or onion or carrots leave it out. You can add other veggies like mushrooms, drained green beans, broccoli etc or a frozen California blend. \nIf using small zucchini you may not have to peel them. You can use yellow crook neck squash too or a mixture of both.\nIf keto: leave out the rice and substitute cauliflower rice.",

Seasonings.   I form it into burgers and fry them up, chill, portion and vacuum seal them.  The trick to getting it to bind into a cohesive loaf or burger without having to add more than the eggs and cheese is to process the meats/ingredients very well, almost into a paste, so that it holds onto more of the fat and has a good texture when cooked.  Delicious cold too.",

So, say a beef casserole calls for one can of cream of mushroom that's 8 carbs for 1/2 a cup with 2.5 servings in the can, how does that break down into the whole dish? Or am I thinking too much into it?",

                            "comment": "You are not thinking too much into it because I have had the same thoughts. If you are using a whole can of cream of mushroom, that would be 20g carbs total in the entire dish from the cream of mushroom alone. However, you likely are not eating the whole dish in one sitting, so if you break the dish down into servings, you can better calculate how many carbs you are getting. You probably are not even having a single serving of cream of mushroom if one whole can is being used in the entire dish. At most, you likely are having a half or quarter serving of the cream of mushroom (2-4g carbs) depending on how large the dish is and how many servings it's broken down into. Hope this helps some and makes sense.\n\nAlso, I should mention that the dishes I listed will require some modifications to become keto. I use cauliflower rice instead of traditional rice in stuffed bell peppers. The chili would be without beans. Swap out regular mashed potatoes for cauliflower mash in the shepherd's pie. For the spaghetti/mostaccioli, you can use spaghetti squash, zucchini noodles, or other low carb/zero carb pasta if you are able to find it and use a low carb pasta sauce, like Rao's.",

But even with chili, I like the McCormick chili packet recipe and there are carbs in the packet, the tomatoes, paste or sauce. Its hard to figure out how much carbs I'm consuming.

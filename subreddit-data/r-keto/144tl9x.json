    "postText": "Hey ketoers, I\u2019ve searched and found a couple of posts about this already, but do any of you have experience with keto reducing your intraocular pressure?\n\nI\u2019ve been eating keto for about a month but went for an eye check up today and my pressures were around 30. \n\nAnecdotes here and some PubMed searching seem to suggest the IOP should drop on keto, but maybe I haven\u2019t been doing it for long enough yet? Or I was pretty stressed leading up to the appointment, and maybe that\u2019s played a role?",

But because the results were high, I\u2019ve been referred to a specialist for further testing next week. I had the secondary tests done last year and they weren\u2019t conclusive for glaucoma at that stage - like \u2018maybe your eyes were born this way\u2019 - but I guess next week\u2019s appointment will prove it or not. Having seen the positive feedback in this sub re. eye health (one of the many reasons I\u2019m doing keto) I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s going to help",

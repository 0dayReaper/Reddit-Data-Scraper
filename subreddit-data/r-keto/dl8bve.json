Sticking to keto and working out 5-6 days a week consistently over about a year. Feeling so great and I\u2019m so happy I could conquer the ride after becoming engaged with the same wonderful person by my side. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb",

So embarrassing to hold up the ride and have to get off.  Got on a scale later that week and saw I hit an all time high of 299. That's when I decided I was going keto.\n\nHad my big month long camping trip in July (lost 10 just being outside and active everyday), and started in late August (grandma passed in August days after returning from camping and was in no mood to start a new diet).\n\nIn the past 2 months I've lost 30 lbs with keto, so 40 total and my pants are getting looser, so I can't wait to get back to Cedar Point again and get back on my favorite ride!",

I prefer the meat based diet with fat. Tastes better and doesn't affect my mood negatively like sugar. But I've been drinking too much zevia. I love that it tastes sweet with out actually being sweet.",

It's probably been around 11 years since I rode any of them due to size restrictions and me being too big to fit in the seat.  Went this past weekend and rode them all including a bunch of new ones that have been built in these last 11 years.  I loved it so much.  I have a season pass now and can't wait to go again next spring and summer to do it again.  Its a wonderful feeling to get to do these things again.",

I was gasping for air the entire ride, small breathes, and I didn\u2019t know anything about the ride. So I started to panic, thinking it was a fast roller coaster, and the G force would for sure not let me breathe the little breath I had. Luckily it\u2019s not a fast ride, but it did break down mid ride. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m glad you were able to ride it. Hopefully I can next year",

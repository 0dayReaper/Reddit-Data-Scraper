    "postText": "Hey Fellow Keto peeps!\n\nSo my official start date was 11/28/2016 I started at 428 pounds and am now currently 363 for a total of 65 pounds. No cheat days I've been on strict 20-25g net carbs since that date. At first I was pretty depressed really wasn't seeing the difference but now looking at the scale of the progress on these pictures its amazing. \n\nMy first goal is to be 350 then 300 hopefully by June of this year. I honestly wish I would have stuck to keto all those years ago when I first tried it and failed pretty quickly. \n\nHere is my before and after (NSFW in a sports bra)\nhttp://imgur.com/VIThdkh\n\nHere is a before and after Headshot yes I know I'm not smiling lol \nhttp://imgur.com/szz3yLP\n\nHope it helps to inspire others that may think they are too far gone to get on the wagon. I have been there and let me tell you Keto was the best decision I ever made for myself.\n\nEdit: Wow this kinda blew up on me lol Thank you for all the kind words and encouragement. I have a long ways to go but every loss even small is a step in the right direction. Also I have gotten alot of comments regarding what I eat you can add me to myfitnesspal if you have it my name is the same as it is here lilbitofsarcasm My food diary is there and always open. \n\nEdit 2: Oh my words ty to the two people for reddit Gold!! Was not expecting this at all! Thank you again to everyone!!\n\n",

I took 300 mg magnesium and 950 mg potassium each day, and called my doc to have her okay it, as the potassium box says to max take 300 mg a day. \n\nShe was a bit wary and took my blood to have the potassium, magnesium and tricyglides (?) checked, before she green lighted it. I'm getting the results tomorrow. \n\nI went down to a daily potassium dose of 300 mg until I have the results, and slight chest tightness is back. \n\nHow much do you take of the supplements?",

It's very common to have some vitamin or electrolyte deficiencies if you've been sticking only with certain foods or types of foods. \n\nThis will better help your doctor determine the cause and give you a more focused and attenuated treatment (if the issue for the chest pain is the vitamins/electrolytes).\n\nI hope all works out for you, health wise, and continue the good progress with your lifestyle change!\n\nPS: I'm sure your doctor informed you, but if the chest pain is severe, persistent, or comes alongside any other symptoms (shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, etc) call 911 (if in the US) or seek emergency care. Good luck!",

Wasn't planned, and went up again in kcals, but I definitely didn't have any foods that contained potassium. I log all my food and didn't get anywhere near 4700 mg from my food, not even 500 mg. I'm positive there was a huge deficit, and I'm hoping my blood work will show that, so I have the explanation as to why I had the continuous pain. It wasn't bad, it wasn't majorly alarming, but having a constant chest tightness and mild pain for a week or so, is a bit unsettling. \n\nThank you again for your reply. ",

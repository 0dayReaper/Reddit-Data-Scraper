    "postText": "Now that I have your attention, I just wanted to share this word of advice for everyone using keto to lose weight. I'm down 130+ at this point, and the one thing that repeatedly held me back was feeling comfortable in how well my clothes suddenly fit.\n\nLong story short, I started buying clothes a size smaller than I could wear, and stopped wearing anything above the tightest I had. The result is that, even after I plateaued for a long time, I'm down six more waist sizes. It's a constant motivator.\n\nP.S. Oh, and don't actually throw them away -- sell them at a thrift shop or donate them to a charity!",

            "comment": "Shirts that have gotten too big i either break out the sewing needle, thread, and scissors, that is if i likr wearing the shirt, or i rekegate to nightgown.\n\nPants, well sewing up it is! and i have a crackhead neighbkr who keeps giving me cute clotges he cant sell, some i could never wear because of my body type. For example he recently gave me a size 6 light boned cirset tube top. My vone structure wouldnt go below a size 9 at 16 and 111 pounds which at the time eas optimal for my hight and build. Plus, the cups for tge boobs wont fit above id say a c cup gal. At 16 i was a d cup, and currently at last measurement i was a j cup (double g for uk) but im sure im smaller than that now though id never be as low as a c cup.\n\nSome of tge clothes he gifts me, are small but i will eventually be able to wear which will save me on buying a new wardrobe once i get where i want to be, and some are small but i can wear in a few months because of my progress but long te id have to alter or replace.\n\nTotally get keepibg clothes too small to wrar now because u can always wear later. But im not buying a lot clothes wise to have my clotges fit right now because im a mentalky disabled single mom to a tween, id much rarger alter clothes as needed for myself and buy house needs, clothes for my child, or cat needs/bills.",

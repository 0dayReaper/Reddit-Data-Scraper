    "postText": "Any suggestions for homemade keto coffee creamer? \n\nI usually use store bought sugar free coffee creamer, but I'm starting to get sick of it\n\nI do stevia and half &amp; half sometimes, but I like flavor in my coffee (caramel, cocoa, vanilla, etc.)\n\nSome people make their own non-keto coffee creamer using condensed milk. Does anyone know any tried and true alternatives?",

It's wonderful tasting, keto compliant and easy.",

When I do Bulletproof coffee I use Kerrygold butter, cinnamon, and monk fruit extract then froth it all together. That's very good too. \n\nI wish I could do black coffee to be an IF purist, bit it tastes disgusting to me. When I want a caffeinated beverage to which I don't add anything I do green tea.",

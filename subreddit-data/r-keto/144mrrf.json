    "postText": "Ok. This might sound out there, but\u2026 I\u2019m thinking of drinking extra virgin olive oil as my main calorie intake. Paired with 4 equate protein shakes, a power crunch protein bar, and a serving of salmon from my mail route Publix, I\u2019ll reach 170g protein, 28g carbs, and\u2026 I dunno how many grams of fat. Guess it depends on how much I can stomach the oil. It\u2019ll be a good amount of mono and poly fats though. Lots of, if not ALL, added nutrients from protein shakes. Is it\u2026 possible to actually do though? Like, have so many liquid calories as part of my diet? Would it have adverse side effects? Like\u2026 diarrhea? Which I could NOT have, even if I have a comfort stop en route at my disposal.",

Those already have the right macros and less likely to give you diarrhea (like chugging liquid olive oil).",

Liquid calories are kinda a way to fool my body into ingesting resources, but I don\u2019t feel good just drinking pop all day. Protein shakes and bar, because it tastes sweet, are kinda good because they keep me feeling full and they\u2019re good nutrients. The problem stems from low calories and that they\u2019re noting but proteins. Not good energy source. So I end up feeling weak. I\u2019m thinking if I consume a lot of fat, then I can learn to burn that instead as a primary fuel source. And because it\u2019s so dense and so high calorie, maybe I\u2019ll have energy to spare?\n\nEdit: also, I suffer from lots of inflammation in my legs. I hear olive oil is very good at reducing this.",

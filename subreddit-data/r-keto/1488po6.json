My starting weight was 70kg, GW 60kg so my estimate is you would be losing it even faster. Using a MyFitnessPal to track my calories and macros, and weighing every morning keeps me motivated! Good luck, you\u2019ve got this! Don\u2019t worry about slip ups, just keep going. 90% compliant is better than not at all.",

Calorie counting while eating a healthy balanced diet was really hard for me, i was constantly hungry and light headed and frustrated. I, too, was losing 0.5 kg a month that way and it was excruciating always being hungry and not seeing any results. My friend suggested Keto and I slowly started reducing carbs and delaying my breakfast over around 2 weeks and until I got to Keto and OMAD. I\u2019m 5 weeks in, 5kg down, people are noticing and it\u2019s been so easy. I\u2019m a total Keto convert! I\u2019m not hungry, I have heaps more energy and the weight is shifting. I\u2019ve also relaxed my diet a bit so if there is a party I might have a tiny bit of chocolate or icecream, or a sip of wine, I\u2019m finding allowing myself just a bite or two of these foods at occasions like that is enough not to feel deprived and I just get back onto the no carbs straight after and it has not affected weight loss. I will also note my diet had always been healthy before, just big portions so I am eating a Mediterranean style Keto with lean meats, fish, lots of low carb salad &amp; veg, olive oil instead of butter. There is a lot of scientific evidence behind the Mediterranean diet and I didn\u2019t want to switch my eating style completely. I\u2019m eating most of the same foods as before, just without the carb portion. This has made it easy to stick to for me. I hope you\u2019re inspired to start/continue you\u2019re keto journey and best of luck!",

I tried eating a healthy balanced diet between 1500-1800 a day and I was just constantly hungry! I\u2019ve only started doing keto few days ago and the difference is night and day.

If you find you're not hungry/weak/tired/craving carbs, there's no need for someone with your stats to eat your whole calorie or fat macro. As long as you get at least 50g or so fat per day, you'll be fine. By lowering your calorie intake, your body will use your body fat for its energy needs. (Once your BMI is closer to \\~30 or so, my advice will change -- a 30% deficit becomes too difficult once someone is closer to an ideal body mass.) \n\nRate of loss has a lot to do with a calorie deficit. Doing some gentle walking every day will help keep your metabolism running. Doing some basic body weight exercises like planks and squats will help maintain muscle (which is something you want to do. keeping muscle you have is way easier than building it up again once you've wasted it away).",

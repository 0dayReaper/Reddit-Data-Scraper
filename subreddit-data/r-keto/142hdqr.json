    "postText": "Has anybody successfully used a \u201cre-feed\u201d to end a weight loss stall? \n\nConsidering it. My weight loss has plateaued for several months now and I\u2019m constantly hungry. \n\nEating around 2k calories a day, but exercise almost every day. Mixture of weights/HIIT/endurance/Yoga. 300-600kCals a day if you believe the HR monitor app. Currently around 175lbs, 5\u20199\u201d, 47 year old male. \n\nMy calories in are slightly higher than when I started 30lbs ago, but my activity levels are higher. Have tried to cut calories but I\u2019m starving the days I do. I generally IF 16:8, and I\u2019m not usually hungry until I eat, but when I do, I\u2019m basically insatiable. \n\nThe TDEE calcs say I should be at roughly 2600 a day, so a bit of a mystery as to why I\u2019m not losing. I know my deficits is lower than when I started, but I should be dropping a pound a week. Perhaps a re-feed is in order to re-set my hormonal system. Thoughts? \n\nAlso, not really eating the Keto Frankenfoods (only occasionally) and my snacks are weighed and logged.",

You also mentioned yourself you\u2019re consuming more than you did. \nLet\u2019s assume we believe the HR monitor and take the low end 300 since we\u2019re try to cut, that puts you around 2000 give or take.\nThe results are showing your getting maintenance calories but if you just want to give re-feed a go that\u2019s totally fine. My take would be eating the same amount of food but lower the calories if starving is an issue.",

Once every month or so I\u2019ll generally have a pretty carb heavy meal. \n\nThat being said the reason for a weight loss plateau comes from one thing and one thing only. You are eating too much. Weight loss isn\u2019t linear but several months of not dropping weight means you aren\u2019t in a deficit. Could you be not tracking your calories quite as closely as you used to? Condiments/sauces/butter/oil can rack up the calories pretty quickly if you aren\u2019t tracking and weighing amounts",

My suggestion, use the sedentary suggested intake for weight loss. Then after a week or two if you find you're too weak to continue activity levels, then add 100-200 calories per day. \n\nYou're basically an ideal weight now, when you're already at a basically normal weight, when you're in a deficit you'll be hungrier than you were when you were more overweight.\n\nFWIW, weights, yoga and endurance don't burn many extra calories. HIIT can burn some, if you're doing it right, but again, if your goal is weight loss I wouldn't count on those calories burned as helping me lose. Exercise is for health or body composition, weight loss is in the kitchen.",

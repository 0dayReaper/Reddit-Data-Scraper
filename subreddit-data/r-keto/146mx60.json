    "postText": "Hi everyone, first time posting here. Huge fan of this community :)\n\nMy wife and I love Keto and have managed this diet (with IF and of course CICO) many times, and had amazing results. We are huge advocates and recommend it to friends and family, specifically to help lose weight.\n\nWe also love to entertain and throw parties, where people let loose and drink alcohol. We do the same, but with 0 carb seltzers/\"beers\", or mixed drinks with Coke Zero and 40% Rum/Whiskey/Vodka.*We specifically track everything in MyFitnessPal to ensure we don't overdo carbs.*\n\nThe issue is the next day, the hangovers are often BRUTAL - we try to mitigate by chugging water before going to bed, but it doesn't always work.\n\n\n.\n\n\nMy questions:\n\n**1. Is it possible we are breaking keto somehow, by drinking too much 80 proof spirits and carb free alcohol mixed drinks?**\n\n**2. Will the body convert alcohol into carbs/ stop producing ketones and being fat adapted if you drink too much?**\n\n**3. Should we be calculating alcohol as net carbs?**\n\n.\n\n\n\nThanks everyone and sorry if they're dumb questions! Cheers",

Other low carb beers and seltzer and mixers, even zero calories may cause blood sugar spikes. \n\nYour body will prioritize burning alcohol first as it is a toxin, then carbs then fat so drinking too much will stall you a bit and dehydrate you as a double whammy. Alcohol is broken down eventually into CO2 and water by the body. \n\nSo, drinking too much will 100% stall your ketosis depending on how much and how often you drink but not spike blood sugar unless you drink mixers or low carb beers/drinks. \n\nIf you are doing keto for weight loss, alcohol is NOT your friend. Best to keep at 1-2 drinks per week or cut out all together until you reach your goals.",

It seems you are in ketosis, so you are to some degree optimised to deal with your food intake.  You are also fasting.  Both of these things make your digestion/metabolism rather efficient.  Then you throw is some alcohol.  Now I wouldn't say that this is a disrupter particularly, but I suggest that in the absence of your metabolism having anything else to do it is metabolising the alcohol very quickly.  In addition to this, this diet is to some degree diuretic (particularly in the early days) and electrolytes are key.  It could be that the alcohol is disrupting here and potentially making you dehydrated or deficient in the short term.\n\nA theory, not a statement of certainty.  But this is where pondering your question led me.\n\nI should say, I'm almost entirely alcohol free, so heavy drinking and alcohol are not my area of experience, let alone expertise.  :)",

You body wants to get rid of it as quickly as possible. It will use alcohol for energy preferentially just to get it out of your system.

At this point cortisol spikes (makes your body choose lean mass for fuel instead of fat) and puts removal of acetaldehyde as your body\u2019s top priority. As such, anything good you\u2019re hoping might go on inside you takes a backseat. \n\n\nBest solution: don\u2019t drink at all. next best: drink less. perfectly acceptable solution: decide that the fun and community of the parties/current level of alcohol consumption are well worth the sacrifice to health and body composition. You will probably still make some progress with respect to fat loss.",

I normally have like 5 of those in a night plus like two green tea shots (they def have sugar lol). \n\nI think the water in the vodka waters I order really help mitigate hangovers as it helps keep me hydrated. I also *never* go to bed after a night out without eating. I\u2019ll pop a low carb tortilla with ham &amp; cheese into the micro or whip up some low carb noodles and sausage or something that way my stomach isn\u2019t just eating itself and making me nauseous. Pedialite or Gatorade zero also really helps replace those electrolytes I\u2019ve also used those dehydration powders to help replenish as well. \n\nI do find I\u2019ve been getting more tiered lately when I drink and end my night out early like 12 or 1 instead of 4 or 5am now, idk if that\u2019s because it\u2019s 100 degrees out and it exhausts me or what. \n\nI went to a fair recently with a few friends, had 2 tall boys (tall seltzers) before hand and 3 drinks then got wayy drunk and cut off for the first time in my life lol.

            "comment": "Despite what others have said here, ***no***, alcohol does not stop or even stall ketosis, any more than having a high-fat diet breaks ketosis. Both alcohol and fat get processed similarly, passing through mitochondria and turning into acetlyl-coa to either feed the citric acid cycle or to form the basis of ketones.\n\nKetosis and ketogenesis is based purely on carbohydrate intake (unless you're a T1D) as that controls your rate of GNG, which in turn controls how much you deplete your oxaloacetate reserves. This is what triggers ketogenesis and eventually ketosis. \n\nNote that your GNG production is based purely on the amount required by your brain and red blood cells -- this requirement is going to be satisfied by dietary glucose before anything else, so even if your carbs are low enough to lose weight you won't necessarily be in ketosis, because that requires them to be below a fixed threshold.\n\nA few more specific points:\n\n&gt; Is it possible we are breaking keto somehow, by drinking too much 80 proof spirits and carb free alcohol mixed drinks?\n\nNo, however since alcohol is 7 calories per gram it's very possible that you're exceeding your calorie goals for the day if you're trying to lose weight.\n\n&gt; Will the body convert alcohol into carbs\n\nNo, in fact there's no metabolic pathway where this is even possible.\n\n&gt; and being fat adapted if you drink too much?\n\nIf anything, alcohol consumption would *accelerate* fat adaptation since like fat metabolism it requires mitochondria to break it down effectively and it produces acetyl-coa (the precursors of ketones) very efficiently. Additionally, acetic acid (one of the first breakdown products of alcohol) can cross the blood-brain barrier and thus would help increase brain mitochondria as well.\n\nTl;dr, no alcohol does not kick you out of ketosis. However it can mess with calorie goals, and also hangovers are a thing to watch out for regardless of your diet.",

We work too hard to mess it up and we want to see great results. However, I'm also not at all addicted. It's tougher for some people who enjoy it more than I do. I can't stand feeling dehydrated and crappy the following day. Maybe stick to a couple of times a month. Sweets are tougher to resist for me, would rather I pick whole foods over crap.",

            "comment": "Hello, Im 24 M, 110 kg and I'd like to start with keto, because Im done being fat and unhealthy, but I have few questions about it.\r  \n\r  \nI know what I have to eat, how much etc (I HOPE). But there is company in my country, that sells 'keto packages' for beginners. Its for 3 months and it can be either as 'normal' food (food in packages, that you just mix with water mostly and then fry it, let it cold, etc.), or as only protein shakes. It has pretty good reviews and it looks like people are happy with it. So my question about this is, if its worth it to buy it from this company, even tho its a bit expensive, it will cost more than my normal spending for keto food would be, and if yes, is it better to go only for protein drinks or for normal food? And if its better to start with them, when it looks, like they know what they are doing or should I start all by myself?\r  \n\r  \nCan I just stop for example after 6 months, and start eating normally, but with small portions and without junk food and drinks without any problems, like yoyo effect etc? Of course it would be slowly and some way still keto.\r  \n\r  \nAlso is cardio training enough or do I have to do strenght training aswell?? I love to play beat saber on VR, which is a really good cardio.\r  \n\r  \nI've read many posts here, mainly posts with benefits and all those benefits are mostly for me, because I have all problems described there haha. No other diet really helped me and this can really save me.\r  \n\r  \nThanks in advance for any help!",

Already reached my main goal weight and been in maintenance for the last month and a half. Since then, I don\u2019t really get strict with carbs and allow an ocasional cheat meal when visiting or going out with non keto friends, but usually not reaching 50/100g carbs on those cheating meals. \nTurns out, I end up losing weight next day after cheat meal instead of gaining water weight?\nAfter those cheat meals I keep eating keto through, and stall a bit, but at maintenance I\u2019m not concerned",

You'll drop the weight fast(er), but probably kill your metabolism in the process and hate yourself the entire time unless you have A grade discipline.\n\nIf it were me personally (27M, 260lbs) I'd:\n\n1) Up the turkey as much as it takes to satiate you. 3oz is a children's menu portion to me. Also how are you managing carbs from eating turkey?\n\n2) Consider a keto protein shake alternative. 8g carbs for 1 shake is fine, but you could easily find lower carb alternatives, which would be useful if you up the calories and consume more shakes.",

Where are the carbs coming from lol.\n\nAs a serial crash dieter, I would advise doing something you\u2019ll actually do long term vs trying to do something to \u201ckick start\u201d. If you were inclined to kick start, you might as well just do a water fast for 1-3 days, you\u2019re gonna feel shitty and unsatisfied either way",

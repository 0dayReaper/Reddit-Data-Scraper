            "comment": "I don't mean \"on it\" like following the diet. I just mean \"on it\" like staying enthusiastic about it. Mission makes a low carb burrito-size tortilla that has only 6g net carbs so I have one big taco for lunch and one big taco for dinner on most days, with some alternate meals thrown in for variety. I'm such a picky eater that I don't think I could see success with a different diet.\n\nAlso, I've had to drill 8 additional holes in that belt. :)\n\nEdit: I can't believe how much attention this post has received. Even reddit gold! Thank you everyone. The improvement to my health is a huge benefit to all this, but it's not my reason for doing it, and maybe that's why it's hard to stay psyched. But I'm a huge redditor (puns, right?) and karma is totally something I can understand and appreciate. Either way, there was no doubt I will continue, but you have all given me a renewed vigor. Thanks again. ",

Loads of other stuff too, but mainly filled with artificial sweeteners. \n\nI've found that thickening sauces with defatted peanut flour tastes crazy good, too. It makes veggies different. Especially with chilis/chili paste and a little garlic.  (It's cheaper if you buy the baking kind, vs the \"PB2\" brand).  ",

I am 60 and overweight, high blood pressure, lots of stress in my life and no insurance. I *have* to lose weight and get healthy. I don't eat much these days and have cut out all the fatty stuff I love. I started going to a gym a couple of weeks ago and I go three times a week. I read that you don't do any strenuous working out but you swim and that's good. It's so much better on your joints. Once you get down to a weight that is safe for you to start going to a gym maybe you should consider going. For me it is becoming a habit and if I get a late start I feel stressed but I work it out at the gym. Keep up the good work and don't go back!!!",

Instead, I have a recumbent bike that I've been riding, and I go swimming a lot since my development has a pool. There's kind of an exception to this, I do walk sometimes to treat my roommate's dog. When I do this, I do it with a backpack full of rocks (~70 pounds), which interestingly combined doesn't quite reach my original weight anyway :)",

Keto refers to a ketogenic diet where you eat few enough carbohydrates and your body switches over to consuming fat for energy. In theory, it makes you feel fuller and after an initial period of low energy, you should feel more energetic. I haven't really noticed either of these things but I am losing weight so it's pretty awesome.\n\nNinja edit: And I'm just eating tacos most of the time.",

The thing you need to teach your body now is how to subsist for short periods of time on just your body fat. It will be hard at first to get used to it but after a week or so intermittent fasting will feel completely normal. \n\nThis is also a great time to learn to cook a wide variety of foods. Keto pushed me to expand my tastes for more foods and come up with creative recipes. One of my favorites is half an avocado with an egg in it, baked in the oven. Great morning meal if you throw in a handful of almonds or walnuts!\n\nGood work though man, you will get there!",

In this way the cells with use \"broken\" proteins or other macromolecules as their source of raw material instead of what you eat. It's akin to \"spring cleaning.\" This promotes a deep level of ketosis to supply your brain with the necessary ketones as well as allowing for your gut acidity and metabolism to reset which will help reverse insulinemia which is the reducing of efficiency of insulin.

Does sleeping count? Sorry to ask so many questions, but it really is time for me to get healthy and to do that I need to know.",

With that said many doctors aren't very knowledgeable about things like ketotic diets. #2) This may come across as harsh but you aren't \"big boned\" because everyone's bones are approximately the same size. You have the ability to be 120 if your doctor suggests it as a goal. The good thing about wanting to be curvy, you can get that way and stay that way if you lift weights. Many women worry about getting \"bulky\" but trust me when I say, no one just gets bulky. Doing things like squats, deadlifts, pushups, etc will build you a hot body with a nice butt and a tight core. Go to the local gym and ask them to help you develop a workout plan that includes \"the big lifts: deadlifts/squats,\" or look around online for some. #3) When it comes to nutrition and macros in terms of ketosis... go find a calorie calculator and enter your weight, height, age and subtract 300 calories from that. When you have that number multiple it by .7 and that new number is the amount of calories in fat you will eat each day. Take the original calorie number and multiple that by .25, that will be the amount of calories in protein you are going to eat. The remaining calories will be in carbs but just shoot for about 20-30 grams of carbs (not counting fiber) per day. Take the number of calories in fat and divide it by 9 which is the amount of calories per gram of fat (900 calories/9=100grams of fat per day) while protein is 4 calories per gram. #4) Most people who try intermittent fasting go with an 16/8 split or an 18/6 split. I'd suggest you try either a 15/9 split or 16/8 where you fast for 16 hours, which includes sleeping, and do all of your eating in that 8 hour window. When I was doing it I would usually eat between 12pm to 8pm and then fast from 8pm to noon the next day. \n\nI hope this helps!",

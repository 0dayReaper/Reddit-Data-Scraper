            "comment": "Wow! Thank you for all the lovely and supportive comments! :) I'm sorry for not replying to everyone, I posted this just before I left the house thinking it wouldn't get much attention only to come back to dozens of comments! A few people are asking how I've done it and how long it took, so I'll address it here. :) I started I believe around November 2012, I started with hardcore keto and had lost about 15kgs when my \"before\" photo was taken. Sadly, I don't have any of me at my max weight. I did take some secret ones, but my phone broke and I lost them. :( I only have a couple that were taken by other people when I already lost 10-20kgs. Anyways, I've been on and off strictly dieting for the last year or so as my life has been pretty chaotic... New jobs, moving interstate, family issues, travelling etc... So sometimes my actual weight loss itself stalled for a few weeks/months but thankfully I never put weight back on. Now that my life has settled back down I am fully focused once again and hope to reach my goal weight by my 25th birthday in May next year. :) \n\nI was completely miserable at my biggest and pretty much throughout my entire life... I've always struggled with depression, ever since I was little, but by my teenage years I was completely hopeless and suicidal. I had pretty much given up on life by age 21 and just accepted I would be sad and fat forever. I reached my lowest point just before I stated dieting in 2012, I actually contemplated suicide a lot and the only reason I didn't do it was because I felt obligated to stick around and look after my pets. I eventually stumbled onto /r/keto after seeing it mentioned in someone's comment. I saw all the pictures and posts and people who were just as big as me if not bigger losing weight and I was inspired. Of course I had tried every diet under the sun over the years but I always struggled to stick to them. Once I started keto and saw the weight finally coming off, I was so happy and I couldn't believe it. I started losing more and more and became happier and happier. Suddenly life didn't seem so bad anymore and I actually WANTED to be alive... I wanted to have an amazing life where I could do anything I wanted. I never used to see a future for myself but now I have a million dreams and things I want to achieve. I still struggle with depression sometimes as it has been a really difficult journey for me, physically and emotionally... But I'm getting there. I feel like a completely new person, which can also be difficult to deal with sometimes... But I would never go back to who I used to be or how I used to feel, not for anything. \n\nIt was the little things that kept me motivated along the way... Walking into a non-plus size store and buying things that actually fit me. Walking briskly up a flight of stairs without even losing my breath. Borrowing someone's jumper and actually having it fit. Wrapping a regular sized towel around my body. Sitting down without having to worry if the chair was going to hold me or not. Things that must sound so stupid and mundane to other people made me so happy and gave me so much motivation to keep going.\n\nI still have another 30kgs or more I'd like to lose, but I'm confident I can get there! I feel like I've come such a long way now that 30kgs doesn't even feel like that much to me anymore. I can't wait until I get there. :)\n\nOh, and to those who are asking, I got the polka dot dress from modcloth.com! :)",

Thankfully I found this sub two or three weeks ago and starting my keto diet six days ago. I hope I can experience the same things you experienced in the 3rd last paragraph :) once again thanks for sharing! ^^\n",

There's new research that the gut biome of fat people is quite distinct from that of thin people - and we also know that anxiety and depression are tied more to the gut than we ever realized.  \n\nAs you lost weight, your body changed inside and out - and so did your mind.  I think my own thought patterns are more depressive when I'm gaining weight/very large - but I wasn't big as a kid, which is why I'm asking.  I guess it's a chicken/egg question - but interested in your viewpoint.  \n\nYou've had so many NSV's as you've gone along - it's amazing.  You should consider writing an article, blog or book.  ",

The first hair removal will be a little painful and might take you a couple days to get brave enough to get it all done...but after that the maintenance is SOO easy and painfree!  Leaves you just as smooth as waxing and really lightens/thins out the hairs just like waxing does which is why maintenance doesn't hurt at all.\n\nOnly it's $100 one time forever so you save a ton in the long run :D  ",

I was in the same place a while ago, I had stalled/plateaued and was getting incredibly frustrated. You have to find what motivates you the most and keep playing off that. One of my motivaters is clothes, as silly as that sounds. I love dresses and wearing heels, but being big doesn't really allow for much of that. When I first started dieting, I bought this beautiful cherry-print dress, I wanted to wear it SO badly, so I hung it up in my room wear I would see it every day. Every time I felt sick of keto or felt like binging I'd look at it and remember just how badly I wanted to fit into it and feel pretty. It wasn't long before I fit into it and then it got too big! I still have it (I can't bring myself to chuck it away or sell it...) but it's completely unwearable now. I have hung a few different dresses up over the months and have found it to be a fun way to motivate and remind myself to stick to it. Find something like that which will help you stay focused. :) I've got an entire secret pinterest board called my \"skinny bitch list\", haha. I pin lots of different clothes I wanna wear, places I wanna go, beaches I wanna wear a bikini on, marathons and comps I wanna do... I have it set as my homepage and it just serves as a little reminder of all the cool crap I wanna do when I'm done losing weight. :)\n\nI think it's important to not be to hard on yourself either, you know? If there's a morning tea on at work and you wanna eat a piece of cake, why not, just don't be like \"well I've eaten cake I may as well binge all day now\" and then that turns into a a weekend, then another week, then a month etc... I'm a huge chocoholic so sometimes I'll treat myself to a little square of chocolate. As long as I go for a walk or add it to MFP so I know I've accounted for the calories, I'll still lose weight. :) I find if you limit yourself too much you're more likely to binge or go off dieting.",

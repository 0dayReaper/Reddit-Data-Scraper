Also, it's easy to keep wearing the size that you've always worn, even if it's too big.  \n\nTake her clothes shopping and have her see how small a size she can fit into.  That might give her an a-ha moment, plus some clothes that will fit better than the ones that are now too big for her.  Baggy clothes will hide weight loss, too!",

    "postText": "Going to try to keep this short. \nStarting weight: 327 lbs\nStarting keto weight: 306 lbs\nCurrent weight: 265 lbs\n\nObviously not losing sight of the progress made but I\u2019m getting dejected by how stuck I feel.\n\nStarted keto for the first time ever in November. Told myself I would be on it for one year to get to a comfortable weight. I\u2019ve learned so much about nutrition, that has been a huge win.\n\nBUT\u2026 this past March, I was invited on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to France. Two weeks. I decided that I would go to low carb/\u2018normal\u2019 for the trip and get back on keto when I got home. (I\u2019m glad I did\u2026 France was delicious but so not keto friendly LOL).\n\nGot back end of March and I\u2019m having the hardest time going more than a week without screwing up, giving in to cravings, and the scale hasn\u2019t changed. I was lucky in that I was dropping weight at a reasonable speed without exercise. I\u2019ve started adding daily 20-30 minutes of work this week but the cravings are killing me. \n\nTips? Advice? Cheat codes? \ud83d\ude05 what do you do to get back on track. Thanks in advance.",

You tell yourself, \"eh, what's one more day, when I've been eating like crap for the last week?\" And then you keep telling yourself that got another day, then another, then another, until suddenly it's been a month (or longer)!\n\nI've found that if I can get through ONE DAY, the cravings are so much better, and it's a little easier to stick to it because I've put some time and work in already. So try to just get through ONE DAY without carbs. Don't think of it as \"this is it, no more ice cream forever,\" etc. It's just today. Just one day, and see how you feel tomorrow.",

    "postText": "Just bc 10lbs, while not a lot at my weight, still feels like such a huge chunk \n\nI gained a lot of weight after taking a new med (I got off it but the weight did not come off). I was 200lbs one year ago and shot up to 229.\n\nToday I\u2019m down to 217. I have such a long way to go but being under 220 is such a relief. I feel like I have control. It feels so good to know that now I only have to lose 67lbs instead of 79 lbs \n\nJust wanted to share. Feeling really good today.\n\nEdit: this community is awesome, thank you all so much for the motivation and support!",

I haven't been able to lift weights and I have noticed a lot of muscle atrophy already. I'm concerned that any weight loss has just been muscle loss. I'd love to start upping my protein and calories to support muscle recovery but I'm concerned about undoing all the pain I've gone through getting through keto so far. I think in another thread it said there was no benefit to getting a glucose/ ketone meter to see what affects it has on the body and to just monitor how I feel/ results but I am worried because what I feel on keto is bad and what I feel not on keto is good, so am I supposed to judge that if I feel good eating some more protein that's an indication I am doing something wrong?

But I am realistic and I know it\u2019s not the best plan for everyone. You have 2 plans. Do one for 6 months and see how you feel and how much weight you lost. If you are not happy, try the other plan!",

Same goes for me.\n\nOP: If you need to lower your glucose and A1C levels (T2 diabetes or pre-T2 diagnosis), then definitely go for keto rather than vegan-anything...veggies (and fruit, if you eat that too) can be too high in carbs to manage glucose and A1C. If your levels are good, then just go for the calorie drop.",

Just substitute the meat/protein for organic tofu/tempeh/edamame/natto if you do soy, seitan if you do gluten, nuts, seeds and vegan protein powders. You can use all the plant based keto oils like olive, coconut, MCT and avocado for fat and of course eat all the keto friendly veggies, especially leafy greens. \n\nTry r/veganketo and r/vegetarianketo .\n\nKeto is only about macros. Whether you achieve those using processed or whole foods, carnivore or vegan is entirely up to you.",

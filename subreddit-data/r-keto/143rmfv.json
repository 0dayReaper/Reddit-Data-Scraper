    "postText": "A couple of posts recently about people's experiences with doctors who \"get\" keto (and my own recent experiences with a couple of doctors who definitely *do not* \"get\" keto) have got me thinking about the search for a more informed doctor. That search isn't working so well for me (more on that below), but I thought I'd share what I found in case it helped anyone else.\n\nFor anyone else in my situation, I found a listing of around 20 different directories for low-carb doctors: [https://metabolicmultiplier.org/keto-doctors-near-me/](https://metabolicmultiplier.org/keto-doctors-near-me/) There are the usual suspects on there like the Diet Doctor search, and some more obscure ones. I obviously can't vouch for any of the sites or the doctors listed on them, but if you want to check your area for a new doc who might be more supportive and don't know where to start, maybe there will be something there to help.\n\nAs for me, I'm in Ontario and am starting to suspect that doctors here don't want to rock the boat of our government-provided health care (OHIP) scheme's official SAD guidelines for diets or something. The only doctors I can find in my area on any of the lists (or on Google, for that matter) are specialists, naturopaths, dieticians, etc. I'd just like a new family doctor. Any Torontonians with a decent family doc got any tips on how to locate one? Mine's...mediocre.\n\nAnyway, hope the links on that site help someone. If anyone has any other websites that aren't in the list, or general tips for others finding a doctor, feel free to add them in the comments.",

My GP referred me to a metabolic specialist that got me on Keto.\n\nMaybe you could find a metabolic specialist or a dietician and ask them if they have any GPs that refer to them?\n\nOf course finding a family doctor of any stripe is difficult in Ontario right now.",

            "comment": "I had great luck doing a lookup on the Society of Metabolic Health Practitioners website. Their mission is to represent all researchers and practitioners working to improve metabolic health around the world through education, training, and support of evidence-based nutritional approaches, **including carbohydrate restriction**, as a valid therapeutic option or intervention.\n\nThe providers listed on the site are going above and beyond to support lifestyles and modalities they believe in. You can find traditional or naturopathic doctors, nutritionists, and other health care professionals.\n\nI previewed search results for Ontario. I think you will have good luck finding someone who meets what you need. Since I'm not in Canada, I can not speak about it they are our are not covered by OHIP. Lately, I do not endorse and specific provider or represent this site. I just had good results and want to share.\n\nhttps://thesmhp.org/",

            "comment": "My doctor was initially sceptical to keto, and she wanted me to see a nutritionist. I didn't mind that, since I wanted more advice anyway, but in preparation for the nutritionist, I made a two-week food-log, writing down all my meals (as honestly as possible). It consisted mostly of meat and veggies, dairy, and some heavy cream and berries for dessert.\n\nThe log changed everything. I showed it to my doctor, and she said \"Oh! This isn't anything like what I thought you were eating.\" Turns out my doctor thought keto meant eating eggs, bacon, butter and nothing else. The nutritionist also used the log to give me concrete feedback, but she was satisfied with the variety in my diet, and didn't try to persuade me away from keto.\n\nSo my advice is to make sure your doctor understands what keto means in practice for you, because you might be speaking at cross purposes. Now that I've lost 20 kg and maintained that loss for several months, my doc just says she's proud of me and that I should keep it up.",

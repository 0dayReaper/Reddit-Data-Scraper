    "postText": "If you asked me a year ago if I would ever and I do mean EVER post a picture of myself on the internet in a bikini I would have laughed in your face. That would involve me wearing a bikini which would never happen... but yet here we are.\n\nBefore/After pic: (probably slightly NSFW) Side note: I\u2019ve lost almost 100lbs so I have loose skin and stretch marks etc. but fuck it. If you don\u2019t want to see that then fair warning to you before you click.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BgMIptU.jpg\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking of starting keto...hopefully I can help convince you that it works. It worked for me, and in all honesty if I can do it then you most definitely can do it as well because I\u2019m just a normal person who used to love carbs until I realized carbs do not love me back.\n\nNow on the real, my body is not \u2018perfect\u2019 and there is still a big part of me that feels like I shouldn\u2019t be posting a picture in a bikini. I\u2019ve always been overweight and it\u2019s really hard to get to a point where I don\u2019t feel like I am and am always going to be the \u2018fat girl.\u2019\n\nIve started to realize now though that perfect is a myth though and this has helped me go from hating my body to finally giving it the love and acceptance it deserves. Jiggly parts and all!\n\nKeto has changed my life in so many ways that I never expected and it can change yours too. It\u2019s not going to always be easy but it will be 1000 % worth it.\n\nBikini pics \ud83d\udc59 on r/keto are optional, but highly recommended if you\u2019re looking for a liberating but some what terrifying experience.\n\nP.S I\u2019m off to the Philippines tomorrow. Please wish me luck in avoiding carbs. If anyone has any keto friendly local food recommendations send them my way.\n\nEdit: So I thought my post got deleted haha and I just woke up to all of your lovey comments.  Thank you kind internet strangers, and thanks for the Gold and Silver!",

As such, I would expect the comments to her to be courteous, polite, and respectful or you won't be commenting on posts ever again.       \n\nMa'am, I am just so damn proud of you.  You have done great.  You look fantastic.   Thank you for all your help giving advice on here.  YOU are proof that our sub is good.        \n\nThose jiggly parts are your battle scars.  They are proof that you have fought and proof that you have won.  Those jiggly parts are your gold medal.  Wear them with pride.     \n\nHave fun!  Be proud!  You have earned that for yourself.  Take a shit ton of pictures because each and every one of those pictures will be further evidence that you have kicked ass.  Each one of those pictures will be proof that you are kick ass.",

Not even just in a bikini, but just in everyday life. Being overweight is hard for so many reasons, and being able to confidently wear a bikini is just one of those little things that is nice to personally feel comfortable to be able to do now.",

But the non-carbs are so delicious and fatty. Pork adobo is probably the national dish, it's cooked in vinegar and soy sauce. Sinagang is a pork soup with veggies and kalamansi lemon, it is a perfect mix of fatty, slightly sour (from the lemon), and really comes across as soul food. Something that would probably fit well with keto is laing gabi, it's a dish made primarily from Taro leaves and coconut milk, it has a very rich flavor and a great source of fat and the Taro leaves carbs are about 5g/150g. So it's low on carbs, but if you splurge on it you'll probably go over your daily intake.   \n\nOnce again, you look amazing! Have fun in the PI.",

    "postText": "Hey all! \n\nIt\u2019s me again..\n\nJust wanted to show y\u2019all that my goal dress actually fits now! I bought this about September  2019 3 sizes too small to use as a goal dress and to see over time how it starts to fit easier. \n\nWell I tried it on last night and she fits!! \nI pulled it off the hanger and just held my breath while slipping it on, I was just not wanting to get my hopes up. \n\nI\u2019m so happy and surprised that it finally fits and I just wanted to share with everyone!\n\nGetting a goal outfit was my main motivation. I bought this dress because my size (3X) was always sold out. So I decided to get it 3 times smaller and held onto it until I reached that size. Such a motivational thing for me. \n\n\nHere\u2019s my goal dress (: \n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/vCeKjoc\n\n\nEdit: thank you SO much for the awards and most importantly, the kind words and support!!",

I know it takes time, but I\u2019m so impatient! \n\nI committed to one year of strict keto, with no specific weight goal, because I know keto works and I will eventually see smaller sizes. The last time I committed to this WOE, I lost 59 pounds in six months. But seeing your progress today has lifted my spirits tremendously! You did it! You look fantastic! Keto works and I am more convinced to keep on keeping on at this moment than I was a couple hours ago. Thank you so much for sharing! I am so happy for you. Wear that dress and that big smile everywhere!\u2764\ufe0f",

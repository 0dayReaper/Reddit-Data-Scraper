    "postText": "What you probably came for-my before and after: https://imgur.com/a/Fe8vlCN\n\nI always used to hate my body and struggled a lot with self-esteem. Yeah, I look better now, but most importantly I am just in awe as to how much one's body can change when you take care of it. Most other times when I have lost weight on crash diets and what not, I never really gained any self-esteem. I still felt terrible physically and mentally. A diet is so much more than just losing weight. It really does impact almost every facet of your life. I finally found a way of eating that really permeated my life in a really positive way.\n\nSo I have been Keto for about a year now. I definitely have not been really strict, and I have been on and off of it. But I have lost about 33 pounds (which is a lot for us short girl!). And I have absolutely fallen in love with the process of getting healthy and cherishing the beautiful thing that is my body. \n\nNSVs: My sciatica is mostly gone; my low blood sugar is gone; the numbness and tingling in my limbs is gone; My energy is back; I've learned how to cook pretty proficiently, and now cook 99% of all my meals; I feel confident in my body; I care about the actual health of my body; my libido is back; i fit in all of my clothes again (closet shopping FTW!)...the list could really go on for a long time, but I thought those were the most important and relatable ones. \n\nThis sub has really been my rock during this process--seriously love all of you guys. I still want to lose about 10-15 more pounds, but I don't care as much about that anymore. I just want to keep feeling great and not get diabetes. \n\nLets exchange recipes and talk about how keto has made an amazing impact on our lives! \n\nEdit: added some words to make my title make more sense ",

Still stay away from the empty carbs but maybe get some of the good stuff in there instead like sweet potatoes, quinoa, beans etc. Unsure yet, shall see.

My last CrossFit class was 400M run+20 Reverse Lunges+skipping rope for as many loops as you can manage in...whatever time was left. I managed 5 loops so 2KM ran. I just feel like I need to lose a little extra fat around the middle. Like I'm trying to run while wearing a weighted vest. I've already seen great progress in the 2 months I've been doing CrossFit and some of the exercises are brutally fantastic. I've got a couple of targets for this year. Be able to run a 5K without having to stop (or dying) and be able to do pull-ups. Both are really just dependent on dropping an extra 10-20lbs I think.\n\nAs far as food I mostly keep it simple, protein+veg. I made a chili last week I really enjoyed, Cauliflower or cabbage thrown in a food processor is a great way to add some volume to it. It was like 25G carbs for a large bowl (could easily be modified, I had a large jar of marinara and a large can of stewed tomatoes in it) but I've gotten used to OMAD and I ate that for a week straight and stayed dark purple the whole time. Other than that I love salmon and pork loin (sous vide all the way). If you have anything you'd like to share I'd be happy to test it, just that for me I've had no cravings so even though I saved a bunch of keto friendly breads and desserts and crusts and stuff I just never get around to trying them out. \n\nAnd amazing stuff on the 10K, super impressive!\n\n",

Tomato paste makes a great way to thicken and add some extra tomato punch though considering what I had it mine it wasn't needed. Also, you're going to see all the different cuts of meat. Total overkill obviously, I had some left over pork loin that I tossed in. I didn't use cauliflower because I just didn't have room. 10 large servings were made with that recipe.\n\nFor the muffin tin thing, is it a single piece of sliced pepperoni with cheese melted on top?\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Xgq4BO9",

You look incredible, your attitude about this all is amazing and I'm so happy for you that your health has improved.\n\nI'm about your size with similar weight loss and the thing I notice is I feel youthful again.

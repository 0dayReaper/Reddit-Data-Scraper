            "comment": "I'm trying this too, it only kind of worked. I think you have to dehydrate the cheese very thoroughly, but if you're using a dehydrator, it just kind of sweats oil and it's too hot. So I tried leaving the cheese bits in the pantry with a paper towel on top for like a week, then baking them. Some of them turned out ok crunch-wise but others were chewy and weird. There's got to be a better way to do this!",

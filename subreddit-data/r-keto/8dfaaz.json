The SRF then sponsored research by Harvard scientists that did just that. The result was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1967, with no disclosure of the sugar industry funding.\n\nThe sugar-funded project in question was a literature review, examining a variety of studies and experiments. It suggested there were major problems with all the studies that implicated sugar, and concluded that cutting fat out of American diets was the best way to address coronary heart disease.\n\nThe authors of the new article say that for the past five decades, the sugar industry has been attempting to influence the scientific debate over the relative risks of sugar and fat.\n\n\"It was a very smart thing the sugar industry did, because review papers, especially if you get them published in a very prominent journal, tend to shape the overall scientific discussion,\" co-author Stanton Glantz told The New York Times.\n",

Then the less fat you eat, it starts burning the fat you already have.\n\nI like it because it also explains why HC/LF became the conventional wisdom, because carbs are what your body uses most efficiently, so it seemed natural that fat would be the thing to cut. But when you understand that your body also learns to burn fat more efficiently doing it the second way, then it explains why LC/HF can work better.",

Early humans were scavengers, then hunter-gatherers, then sedentary with agriculture and animal husbandry. So the amount of carbs probably went up as time progressed and the amount of time spent in ketosis probably went down.\n\nBut I think the other important thing I didn't mention is that they didn't have overwhelming amounts of food either. So eating a ton of carbs and getting \"fat\" is fine when you're a starving scavenger because you'll probably burn it off in ketosis when you have little food. But it's a problem to do that when you have basically unlimited food like we do today.",

That's a flash in the pan from an evolutionary perspective and not a huge amount of time for a significant shift in basic metabolism.\n\nThe *huge* shift, IMO, has been the easy, year-round, long-distance transportation and storage of crops in the past century.\n\nHumans have always incorporated as much plant matter as we could into our diet, but for the overwhelming majority of it, we were limited to what could be collected locally and in season. For a much shorter span of time, it was limited to what could be *grown* locally and in season. Today we live in a world where you can buy strawberries in December.\n\nI think that, given the time scales involved, it's totally fair to say that human metabolism never evolved to handle the type of continuously available carbohydrate consumption we commonly see today. That's not saying that we never ate carbs or that carbs are inherently bad, just that there's been a shift in the food available to us that occurred far faster than we could have genetically adapted to it.",

Like they ate vegetables back then too and raised animals (animal husbandry started around the same time as the agricultural revolution). I couldn't say what their macros were like but at least their bread didn't have sugar in it, you know?\n\nEither way, I suspect that once humans became sedentary like that it was too late for our bodies to evolve to eating really high levels of carbs.",

Add to that higher rates of disease from starting to live in higher density populations, and the domestication of animals who became disease vectors, life expectancy also went down for generations of humans. We were doing much better as scavenging hunter gatherers. ",

This is what happens when you post at work and don't always have the time to read and re-read to make sure there are no misunderstandings.\n\nBut yeah, a lot of those things are seasonal/regional and were overall not part of the diet in the same way that sugar is now. And we didn't have as much access to food either (like quantities) like we do now.\n\nThe statement was more that humans, as a species, didn't evolve by eating 50%+ of their daily calories in carbs each day. And as civilization set in, the amount probably increased but since we didn't evolve to eat like that it makes sense that our bodies don't do well on it (even if you're counting calories to not overeat).",

The scientist who's reputation is on the line did a lot of studies paid for by a lot of different organizations. He was once paid by the dairy industry to look into the benefits of milk consumption by people after infancy. His published result was the opposite. I'm not saying sugar is good. I'm saying research. All research is paid for by someone and it would do no good if we only listened to that which went against the funders wishes.

Harvey began to suspect that he was being followed on the way home from work; then one night in the summer of 1974, he reported that his office had been raided and his files stolen.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shortly afterwards, the previously supportive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared that miraculin was an additive, meaning that the berries could not be sold as a sugar substitute without further testing. Harvey suspected foul play. He suggested that the FDA had been pressured by the powerful manufacturers of sugar and artificial sweeteners, keen to quash this new challenge to their business, something both parties denied.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cFor the FDA to overturn the ruling, as far as I understand it, would require years of testing and a large amount of money, which it was not possible for Harvey to raise in the poor economic climate of 1974,\u201d explains Canadian author Adam Gollner, who chronicled Harvey\u2019s story in his book, The Fruit Hunters.\n&gt; \n&gt; And so for the next 30 years, the berry was largely forgotten, knowledge of its existence preserved only by a small group of fruit enthusiasts\u2014until Cantu\u2019s new venture.\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/can-miraculin-solve-the-global-obesity-epidemic/371657/",

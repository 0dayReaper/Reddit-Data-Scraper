    "postText": "I\u2019m (26m) back on my second keto journey; I went from 310 all the way down to 200lbs and got sick 2 years ago and fell off the wagon so hard that I\u2019m back up to 280 and can\u2019t seem to move the needle. I know it works since I lost 100lbs doing this before but this time I\u2019m really trying to do it healthier and actually incorporating daily exercise which I\u2019ve been been really diligent about over the last 2 months. It just really stinks to see myself after what I know I could be. Ever since I dealt with all of the illness and everything (as far as I know long Covid) I\u2019ve had POTS symptoms and chronic fatigue and heart rate issues (which my doctors don\u2019t even have an answer for; I even wore a monitor for 2 weeks only to be told \u201cidk hopefully it goes away\u201d and brushed off) I actually went off keto for a while because I thought it could\u2019ve been hypoglycemia issues and realizing it didn\u2019t do anything i spent such a long time basically screwing myself over and now I feel like a failure to myself. I\u2019m getting married in a month and seeing myself in the mirror is a struggle, and I almost feel like I have reverse dysphoria\u2014 I think I look good or without issue but then I see myself in a video or my shadow and I see the reality of what it is and it hurts me deeply. I\u2019m a professional singer and I feel like if I actually got myself in order I could be doing so much more instead of being the fat bald guy in the group. \n\nSorry rant over; thanks for listening",

And falling of the waggon in such a rough time can happen and is completely understandable. \n\nYou try to do better and healthier now, which is great and you are still doing your best, even after 2 months and not reaching the outcome you desired. You also do excercise! That all incredible mind work and something to be proud of. Its hard to build an exercise regimen that sticks longer than one week. You break habits here. So keep up, you will get there! \n\n\\*sending a shoulder tap and nod of approval\\*\n\nYou are no failure, what you do is something great. And you do not fail, as long you do not give up. :)",

It is often associated with weight so if you are back up that might be an issue. \n When you see yourself or shadow just look at at an imaging where you want to be. ..\n\nAnyhow sending good vibes..",

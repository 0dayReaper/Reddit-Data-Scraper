            "comment": "Just a few observations on prices where i live.\n\nI would be careful with canned tomatoes.. Lots of brands, but not all, have quite a bit of added sugar.\n\nFrozen vegetables can be cheap compared to fresh. If used in cooking frozen works quite well, but may release a bit of water. Nutrientwise frozen veggies can in many cases be even better as they \\*may\\* have ripened in the fields instead of in transit.\n\nWhere i live i buy chopped frozen onion for less than fresh onions, and you get no waste from the frozen ones.... and you don't have to chop them ;)\n\nDo have a look and compare frozen vs fresh in your area to see how it looks. Probably differs quite a bit depending on where you are.\n\nMilk and cream can be frozen, so buying close to expiration can drop the price.. Tastes ok but may separate. Does work great in cooking. Freezing cream in a ice-tray makes it easy to just take out as much as you need.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now for a recipe.. \n\nBeef bones with marrow. Roast in oven for 10 minutes.\n\nCheap beef off-cuts. Cut up in smaller pieces if it's big. Roast in oven for 10 minutes.\n\nCarrots, turnip and other vegtables. Just pick the cheaper ones. Don't worry too much about carbs for these as it's should be a small amount of the output. Rost in oven for 10 minutes.\n\nFry up some onions and add to the bottom of a large pot.\n\nAdd all of the above and top off with water until it covers the ingredients.\n\nApplecider vinegar (releases calcium and other minerals from the bones)\n\nSlowcook for &gt;6 hours and then remove the solids. If waterlevel drops below solids during slowcook add some more.\n\nReduce until about half the volume of the initially added water.\n\n= Great tasting, and cheap, broth without any additives. Makes a great base for ramen with some carb-free noodles.\n\nFreeze in ice-trays for easy to use during cooking.",

Have not used cartilage myself so feel free to give a review of your attempt if you do it!\n\nAnd did forget to mention salt and spices but i assume everyone would add whatever suits their taste at the end. Always easier to hit the right taste-profile after the reduction, but let it cook for another 15 minutes after adding.\n\nGood tip with the egg-nudles.. I usally use shirataki noodles, after a good soaking/washing, and then let them sit in the broth and soak a for a few minutes.\n\nI went down the broth rabbit-hole after watching this :)\nhttps://www.frenchguycooking.com/videos/497/french-pot-au-feu-recipe-french-beef-stew",

Protien powder is a must, so i maje yogurt bowls/smoothies.\n\nAs for meat, canned/poubch tuna, preferably on sale, budget shrimp or on sale shrimp , canned fish, 10 pound bags chicken leg quarters, eggs, yogurt are the majority of my go to protiens with on sale fresh fish. Last month i bought a whole drimfush at my locak heb for under $30 and it gave me well over id say 5-6 poubds of meat once cooked and removed from the carcass. So that was actually a really good find, though i easnt a fan of the flavor and really had to season it with strong flavors and mix otger meats in to make it edible.\n\nI do buy beef heart or beef liver as well as chuck or sirloin because im a menstrating f who has a history of anemia and heavy flo cycles so red meat/organ meats have always been a must in my diet. And no, i cant use leafy greens because i dont tolerate them. Really high fiber foods like leafy greens or cruciferous veg wreak havock on my digestion bevause of suspected ibs. Sucks because i like those foods a lot. Though higher carb fruits and veg i find dont cause any issues for me.\n\nOn veg , i do a lot of bulk buys of fresh veg then freezing or preserving. I also forage some on walks, have a potted herb and veg garden at my apt, and have a community garfen plot to help cut costs on that. \n\nBtw, im a mentally disabled single mom to a tween son. Im on ssi which pays $914 per month, and on foodstamps which pays $390 per month now. Thats my total income, around $1300 per month between the two. \n\nThat doesnt include my penny jar which is my rainy day fund, rewards from apps, occasional found on walks scratcher winnings, occasuonal booth gigs selling my art,  occadional selling of scavanged items, etc. \n\nThat said, budget keto is the only option i have , and ops suggestions are one way to do it, but not the onky way.\n\nThough ckearance racks and on sale or items with manifactureres/in stire/in app coupons are my best freind 90% of the time.",

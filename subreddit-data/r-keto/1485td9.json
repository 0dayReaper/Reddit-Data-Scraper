    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI (24F) recently started (literally yesterday) a Keto diet. I am trying this diet as I have M.E (chronic fatigue syndrome) and Lyme disease. \nAt baseline I am 157cm and my weight has fluctuated between 49-50kg (BMI 20) for the last few months. I have roughly been around 48-51kg for many years now.\nI just weighed myself this morning after starting keto yesterday and I\u2019m 46.5kg!\nI know it\u2019s mostly water loss but I haven\u2019t noticed I\u2019ve been peeing more than usual.\n\nI am worried about losing too much weight, I want to try and maintain a healthy weight on this diet as my goal is to see if it will help my health conditions, not to lose weight as I am already a healthy weight. \nHow will I know if I am a healthy weight as if the water losses continue, I will soon have an underweight BMI. How can I tell wether I have lost actual weight (fat/muscle) and need to increase my intake, or wether it is just water loss and I do not need to change anything?\nI know the overnight loss is likely water but it is unsettling for me.\n\nI used to have anorexia/bulimia from the ages of 15-20. I consider myself 99% recovered now but making a big dietary change is still scary for me as I do worry about falling into disordered eating again or losing too much weight (not on purpose). It has taken me a long time to muster up the courage to start Keto because of these worries. I do think I am in a mentally good place to do it though and definitely do not want to get skinnier!",

            "comment": "Increase your calories.  Most of us (who are trying to LOSE weight) consider keto this way:\n\n20g Carbs - limit, do not exceed\n\nProtein and Fat in roughly equal quantities by grams, where Protein is a Meet or Exceed goal, and Fat is a limit to be filled in as needed for satiation.\n\nFor you, I would still say you should have a generous Protein limit.  Eating a lot of protein every day will help prevent muscle loss, an important consideration for anyone.  But, Fat is your key to increase calories.  So you'll probably need to be generous with the fat.  Could be heavy cream or butter in your coffee, spoonfuls of peanut butter, more cheese, nuts, etc.  There are lots of ways to increase fats quickly.  Most of us need to monitor that closely to ensure that we don't have too much.  In your case that is unlikely to be an issue.",

You need to know how much calories you eat, to determine if you are gaining, losing or maintaining weight.\n\nAs for counting macros, you kind of need to stay below 50gr of carbs to stay in keto, maybe even go below 30gr of carbs. It is also important to eat enough protein. So you also kind of need to keep track of the macros you take in. The reason is that your body is going switch from burning carbs (glucose) to burning fat (ketones). If you do not get enough fat and not enough protein, the body is going to use protein from your muscles to create its fuel.\n\nI mean, if you want to manage your weight and carbs to get healthier, it is a challenge to wing it. Knowledge is power.",

I need to keep a 1000 cal deficit otherwise I will pile on the kilos. I got to 360lbs for a reason.\n\nAnother way to do it then is weigh yourself once a week, and if you gain weight, eat a bit less the following week, and if you lose weight, eat a bit more. \n\nIf you don't want to keep an eye on macros, then maybe just find out the macros of the typical foods you are consuming and do a ballpark diet, so you at least know you are in the range of a good macro balance.",

Hydration is particularly important for this as well as when you increase your protein levels to help your kidneys process the uptake. \n\nKeto in itself is not a weight loss diet. Think of it as a healing way of eating to help control metabolic and neurologic disorders. The weight loss benefit comes from the caloric restriction. You can gain, lose, and maintain on keto. \n\nWater loss notwithstanding, if you\u2019re not in a position to lose weight or you shouldn\u2019t lose more, then you mY need to increase your calorie intake to compensate.\n\nI try to think of my weight as a range of 5-8 pounds rather than as a fixed number - that helps to account for fluctuations due to hormones and hydration levels.",

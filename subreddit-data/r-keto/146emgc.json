    "postText": "Damn, all I had to do was cut carbs and I would've been off my medication years ago. Down from 240 lbs to 220lbs.\n\n\nMy macros have been: 100-130g fat, 100-130g protein, 0-50g carbs. I definitely miss eating bread but I feel better than ever!\n\n\nPositive side effects so far besides weight and blood sugar:\n\nI sleep less, down from needing 9 hours to function to 6 hours\n\nI feel so much more awake during the day, more productive, more energetic, more focus\n\nPoop way less, keto (and probiotics) took me from sometimes 5 times a day to basically once every 18 hours, stomach pain is gone \n\nDon't crave water and don't have to pee constantly, I was drinking maybe 2-3 gallons a day and peeing hourly (and waking up to pee) now I'm at like 1.5 gallons a day and pee like a normal person\n\nOccasional blurry vision is gone\n\nOccasional limp numbness is gone\n\nSkin is clearing up\n\nHigher sex drive\n\nResting heart rate has lowered\n\nI don't eat out any more\n\n\nNegative side effects so far:\n\nI miss bread, potatos, corn, oatmeal, sugar, etc. \n\nI'll likely have to buy new clothes soon\n\nMore energy means I'm less sedentary and I don't think my joints are used to that yet\n\nGood quality meat and cheese is more expensive than the usual food I've been eating\n\nPooping is more difficult and takes longer\n\nOccasional heart burn, which is very new to me\n\nI get weird looks when I eat a meal of nothing but meat and cheese at work\n\n\nAll in all I think keto has been life changing so far and I'm happy I started. I'm looking forward to getting off my meds and being even healthier in the months to come.",

Fuck, me I drink 3 liters of water per day, which is 0.8 gallon and thats about as much as I can do in one day. I think drinking 6 liters water per day is a lot, let alone 11 liters! Dude, thats really a fucking lot. When I was in Bosnia on my tour in scorching heat and doing hard labour we were advised to drink 13 liters per day, which was impossible even then. I think if you drink  0.8 gallon you'd be absolutely fine.  Overhydration may, sometimes, disrupt electrolyte regulation, resulting in electrolyte imbalance. And there are a lot of other issues with overhydration. Kidneys become unable to eliminate the excess water, causing dilution of sodium in the blood and a chain of biological malfunctions. Are you sure you drank 3 gallons per day?\n\nEdit: I didn't get from the OP you were diabetic, that changes things :)",

On keto is 1-2 days,  unless I over do the mct oil then it's 3 times a day.\n\nMaybe increase water intake even more and look into a fiber supplement if pooping is hard to do.",

    "postText": "39/m 6'3, 229lbs\n\nA bunch of pictures:\n\n[https://postimg.cc/gallery/1nrs8sew6/](https://postimg.cc/gallery/1nrs8sew6/)\n\nSo I lost a lot of weight in one year.  Maybe that's an understatement.  I've been going back and forth on whether to post my update or not.  I'm not trying to brag or show off.  I'm posting more for motivation for people who haven't started Keto or are just beginning. If i can do it, so can you.  \n\n  \nQuick story:\n\nLife was not great Pre\\-Keto.  I was over 500lbs.  I don't know my exact weight because no scale I had could weigh me.  I had problems getting around. I couldn't stand for long periods of time. I constantly was sweating and always hot.  I'm still upset that I let myself get so bad.  When people say i look great I'm more embarrassed for how I looked to begin with.  \n\nIt took me ruining a family vacation to Universal Studios to begin the process in my mind that I have to lose weight.  I was looking forward to going to the Harry Potter area for years.  I was so excited when we got there.  However, I could barely get around.  Walking around was nearly impossible.  I would have to strategically plan my steps and look ahead for a bench to rest.  I ended up seeing a fraction of the Harry Potter area and instead went to an restaurant w/ AC just so I wouldn't have to walk around.  One day, I will have to make it up to my wife and son and take them back so we actually enjoy Universal Studios.  I wish I could say I went home and began Keto. It would take me another 8 months before I actually decided to start this 'journey'.  \n\nLike I said, I don't know my exact weight when i started.  It took me about 5 months before I actually got on a scale.  I was frightened to see the number that would be staring back at me.  I can guesstimate it was over 500lbs as the first time I weighed myself I was @ 386.  I have to figure in 5 months I lost over 114lbs.   \n\nMy diet regimen: I went right into One meal a day.  For me it was really easy.  I stayed in a calorie range from 800\\-1100 a day.  I know that is VERY low and definitely not for everyone.  However,  I never felt like i was starving or famished.  I quickly got into a groove and never looked back.  It helps that I'm stubborn and not a quitter. If I commit to something I'm not going to give up. I never had a cheat day or meal (nor will I).  I know cheat days are not bad but I would feel awful if i ever went off the rails.\n\nI only weighed myself once a month.  I dont want to do live and die w/ the scale.  At Halloween I was 386, when I last weighed myself on June 1 i was 229.  I think the secret for me on Keto was meal planning and cooking in bulk.  I'd smoke a pork shoulder or some chicken on Sunday and have food for the next week or longer.  \n\nThese items made Keto easy for me:\n\n\\-Cauliflower rice was a god send.  There is so much I have done with it.\n\n\\-Shirataki noodle. They are not for everyone but I love them.\n\n\\-Butt Rub. It's a great spice and it's very Keto friendly\n\n\\-Rao's Pasta sauce.   I love that stuff.  Low in carbs and so tasty.\n\nI started out wearing 7xl and 8xl tshirts.  My shorts and sweats were 4xl.  \n\nToday, i'm wearing an XL shirt and L shorts.  Yes, there is A LOT of hanging skin.\n\n When I reflect on my weight loss and where I came from, I think of a movie line from Apollo 13.  It's when Tom Hanks is talking to Kathleen Quinlan after their party looking at the Moon and what it took to get there.\n\n\"It's not a miracle.  We just decided to go.\"   \n\nI just decided to go.

Mad props.\n\n-Edit- Well I wasn't expecting this. \n\nThis community has helped me a lot over the years and I had to ability to give back. This isn't really about me, it's about how great this community is and how encouraging everyone is on meeting our own personal goals together. \n\nThank you for the gold. As much as appreciate it, if you read this and feel the need to show your appreciation. Please instead donate the money you would have for gold to the charity of your choice. \n\nI personally recommend;\nhttps://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/semper-fi-fund/536\n\nYou guys are awesome!

You had mentioned it, but it was also the first thing I thought of when I saw the title of your post. But I'm probably not thinking of it for the reason most people expect. \n\nI always see the loose skin comments come up on posts like these from the OP or commenters. I get it, it is obviously a major factor in massive weight loss. I know some people own it or accept it more than others, but it's a pretty big deal regardless of how you look at it. \n\nAll I want to say is that there are a lot of people like me out there that don't have to \"come to terms with\" or \"learn to accept\" the way you look with extra skin. I think a lot of people assume everyone will see that part of their physical appearance as a negative. \n\nI was once seeing a really awesome dude for a month or two. I really liked him and he was open about really liking me back. We talked almost daily and as things progressed we saw each other more frequently. After a few weeks of talking and a few great dates, we hung out about 5 times in the next few weeks. Lots of making out, hand holding, sweet talk, sincere conversations. He gave me a gift that was very thoughtful and intimate. \n\nHe wanted to take things slow which I was okay with, but one night I was too drunk to drive home. We passionately made out in his bed, but as my hands started to wander to his midsection and thighs he became uncomfortable. I wasn't undressing him or even touching his groin, so I just touched where I gave him the green light to touch me. We were both mid-20s and it was still very G- rated making out. \n\nWhen he tensed up I obviously stopped and asked him if he was okay and what he was comfortable with. He just totally shut down after being very open about everything so far. See, I knew he had lost a lot of weight. And I mean a lot. Something like 200 lbs over the last few years. And he was very attractive, but was still insecure. He'd tell me that he couldn't believe such a pretty and smart girl would like him and I was way out of his league. Of course that was flattering, but I'm about a 7 out of 10 on the scale of generic, college educated, liberal leaning, white girls with glasses. I could walk in to a typical club and rob it's patrons blind because I wouldn't turn a single head. \n\nHe had only hooked up with one person besides his long term ex since losing the weight. I could tell there was a lot of extra skin because clothes only hide so much, but he was clearly convinced I would be disgusted. I would have taken things as slow as he wanted, but even the idea of moving towards it was too much to face I guess. He totally shut himself off to me and started making distance the next day. He stopped responding in any reasonable amount of time and was very cold. A few days later we were supposed to meet up for a date at NASA (where he worked). He was excited to introduce me to his friends and show me all this cool stuff. He was getting special visitor passes and everything. \n\nThat mother fucker started ghosting me the night before. There's no reasonable excuse for that. There's no \"sorry, I forgot/ was busy/ got tied up\" that excuses that. He was being vague and flakey the night before but totally blew me off the next day. He never once did that. He was the kind of guy to call if he was going to be late. Hell, he'd text me where he was and what he was doing just in case I was early because \"I know you're coming over in an hour and we said 5pm, but I'm at the grocery store and won't be there until 4:50 so if you're early you are welcomed to sit on the porch or there's a park the next block over. \"\n\nLong story short, don't make some innocent girl think you're dead for 24 hours because you concocted some bullshit narrative in your head that extra skin means something to her. Just give people a shot. Jesus Christ, I only shave my legs like 3 times a month and that's as much of a deal breaker as anything else to some people but my boyfriend is weird and finds it endearing so maybe I could love your big flappy skin. It's the remnants of an incredible accomplishment. It says you are strong and brave and resilient. It's your battle scar. ",

It broke my heart to be cut out of his life because of something so superficial. Not romantically, because it was too early for that, but it really hurt to be discarded over an assumed reaction. It also made me question why he felt I couldn't be trusted. I know I shouldn't make someone else's feelings about me, but I just wanted to share my perspective. ",

If the last picture in the collage is your resting body posture, you should really look at some exercises designed to re-align your neck in line with your spine.

Chances are it will improve over time, but definitely look into some different posture exercises for that. Congrats though! 25 pounds a month is intense, and a huge accomplishment!",

Dark means you are dehydrated. And light means your ketones are being used as fat. It is common misconception that the darker it is the better. Not true. Being in Ketosis is like being pregnant either you are or you aren't. I have only weighed myself a few times. Last time I did this diet i lost 67 lbs in 6 months. Gained it all back. Cause of course if you eat crap you will get fat again. Not this time. I want to hit my goal weight then i am going to stay around 40-50 grans a day. \n\nBut you are like a keto rock star to us.

I'm eating more than one meal a day, usually it's two with a weird light lunch snack thing in the middle, but I am not nearly as hungry as I was before keto, I have WAY more energy and I feel better in general. I cannot wait for next year to see where I am with this journey. \n\nMy wake up call happened years ago honestly, but I couldn't find any diet that worked where I wasn't starving. I'd stick to the diets and exercise and work my butt off and see a two pound weight loss over a period of six months. I had nutritionists tell me I was lying when I said I stuck to the diet and that I was at the gym three times a week and out walking every single day. \n\nThen I tore my ACL and could barely walk. After that, I gained back the few pounds I had lost. I was honestly about to talk to my doctor about weight loss surgery because I was at that point where I thought it was the only hope I had, when I lost my insurance.\n\nI fell into a depression and stopped caring about my weight. I said \"f this, I'm just fat.\". Then my mom was like, \"have you seen this keto diet\" and handed me a bunch of info. I was intrigued and we both started doing it. She's lost almost 20 lbs too. \n\nIt's been two months and my clothes are already looser. I feel better. My joints are doing amazingly well. My headaches are gone (I used to get debilitating headaches). It's been two months and I haven't felt this good since I was 16. (I'm 36 in 4 days.)\n\nI'm getting married next year and at this point, I'm looking forward to going dress shopping where as three months ago I was dreading it. We're going to plan our Disney vacation once I lose 100lbs, because I know if I go now, I won't have the energy still. \n\nWe live close to Cedar Point and my goal is to ride the roller \ncoasters next summer. I cannot wait. \n\nKeto has given me my life back already. Thank you for sharing. I hope to be as inspirational to someone else as you have been for others. \n\nAlso? Take the tickets. If I could get free tix, I would accept them! (Also also, what people say it true. People who work there get tickets often and don't use all the tickets. Take 'em!)\n\n",

I started out over 500 lbs as well and am on my way down through a  Keto/low carb pretty much no carbs. Gonna tighten up my game a bit and keep at it, knowing that there are stories out there like your\u2019s to keep me motivated. I realized from the onset it was a lifestyle change and not a \u201cdiet\u201d. Just the calorie/portion cutting helped but adding the Keto recipes and low carb recipes has truly made my biggest difference. Sorry too much coffee this morning at work lol. \n\nBut best wishes OP in all you do, you truly are an inspiration!",

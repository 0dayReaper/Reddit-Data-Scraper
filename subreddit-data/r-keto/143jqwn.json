    "postText": "Hello! \nI\u2019m in my first week of Keto as it was suggested to me by my OB to control my PCOS symptoms and help lose weight. I was wary when it was first brought up but I\u2019m officially a believer. One week in and I got my first period in months (usually it\u2019s so beyond irregular). I feel like this could be the thing that finally does it and helps me lose the weight, regulate my hormones, get rid of the facial hair and hopefully help me conceive. Any other pcos (or non pcos) people out here have success stories with their hormones / concieving??",

It did balance my hormones, and i feel better alot better in my skin. I started out at 242lbs. I am still working on losing the wheight. I have had the unfortunate facial hair side effect for years and although that hasn't gone away my skin is so much better, and my joints dont hurt anymore. I have a lot more energy, my periods are somewhat better, i dont have nearly as much pain and bloating but they are still very heavy (however my flow is completely predictable now.) If you stick with it, this life style change will change your life. It isnt easy and occasionally you will get frustrated with platueas...but just keep moving forward. You got this! \u2764",

They didn\u2019t try to get pregnant nor they were on contraceptions. She has a physically demanding job so she wasn\u2019t strict in doing keto. But two three months before she got pregnant, she notice a bit too much symptoms related to PCOS and decided to be good and be more strict. And voil\u00e0. \n\nAs for myself, I was diagnosed with PCOS and insulin resistance when I was 13. I was put on metformin and birth control; both gave me bad side effects so I stopped. Skip ahead 20 years to now. I have been on keto/low card for about 8 years, started to fast regularly for the past 5. \n\nI have been having a ~30 day cycle with ovulation for 90% of the past 8 years. My hormones were normal last time I checked. It\u2019s not easy to get a doctor to order labs more me now because how regular my cycles have been. \n\nIt\u2019s great that OB suggested keto/low carb, not a lot of MDs agree with keto. Don\u2019t see this a diet, see it as a medical treatment and lifestyle change. Stick to it, it can be hard for the first couple of weeks. But it won\u2019t disappoint you. \n\nGood luck.",

My next pregnancy I got pregnant my first cycle on metformin (it can be a tough for drug for some people starting out but I always like to share how successful it was for me to others with pcos because a lot of people talk shit about it!! Lol I\u2019m not planning more babies but I still take 1000mg just for how great I feel on it). Keto helps my periods somewhat but I had an IUD for a long time, and two pregnancies have basically spanned a lot of my adult life. I will say that I do notice doing a very quick switch to keto for me always triggers a period. It has been very effective for weight loss for me, as well. I lost 70lbs in 6 months after my first baby, and I\u2019m 8 lbs away from my goal now that my youngest is 6 months old. Good luck!! It can be incredibly helpful in a lot of ways.",

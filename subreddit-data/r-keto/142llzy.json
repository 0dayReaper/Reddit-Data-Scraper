    "postText": "I recently used Swerve for the first time. I ate it around 10:00PM, and when I woke up the next morning my eyelids were superrrr swollen and I couldn\u2019t stay awake, which is very unlike me. Had a headache and just generally felt like shit all day. Does this sound like it could be a reaction to the Swerve? The timing is too sus for me to think it was a coincidence. Is erythritol something your body will get used to, or if you have a bad reaction your first time, is it likely just not for you? I was so hopeful because it was delicious haha",

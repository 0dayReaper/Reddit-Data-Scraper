The solution is to cook it in butter or olive oil or else add a sauce of cream cheese or heavy cream. \n\nKeto IS about eating generous amounts of fat.  Keto diet strictly limits carbs, generally to 5% or less of daily calorie intake.  Protein recommendations vary from 10-35% of calories.  Any more than that and protein toxicity becomes a risk (nitrogen builds up in the body to a dangerous level because it is unable to clear the waste products of protein metabolism quickly enough.)  This means that the remaining 60-85% of our calories have to come from fat.  \n\nGo to the FAQs and find the macro calculator.  That will do the work for you.  Your part is to weigh, measure, and track what you eat for a couple weeks until you learn what meals will fit your macros. \n\nThere are simplified strategies such as the plan Dr Eric Westman (of Duke University) gives to his diabetes patients.  Two cups of leafy greens, one cup of other non-starchy vegetables, a very small amount of berries,  and all you want of meat, fish, bacon, eggs, butter, tallow, lard, olive oil.  Max four ounces of cheese. \n\nOf course not everyone needs to be that strict, so it is a process of trial and error within these general guidelines.",

And to be effective as a treatment you must stick to it 100%, any slip-ups with your ratios can nullify it's effectiveness,and coming out of keto suddenly can cause more seizures, it's usually not recommended for adults because of this. \n\nAs a fellow epileptic who tried it, I can tell you from personal experience it'll be difficult. I would highly recommend talking with your doctor to work out meal plans, and definitely do NOT alter your medications without asking them.",

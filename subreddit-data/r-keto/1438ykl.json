I don't have a lot of weight to lose, but I hold all of it on my belly.\n\nI do about 16:8 with less than 20g of carbs and approx 800 calories.  I haven't been tracking fat and protein down to the gram.\n\nBy middle of week 2, I was in ketosis.  In week 3, the weight started coming off and I was noticing a difference in my belly fat.  Feeling super-motivated, I added exercise to my very sedentary lifestyle.  The weight would drop even faster, right?\n\nNope.  The weight started going up.  I am right back where I started in lbs and feeling bigger than before.\n\nI'm trying to stay motivated.  What can I do?",

Stopped taking coconut oil daily (thought I could speed up fat loss by limiting dietary fat)\n2. Started taking psylium every other day\n3. Lowered my veg intake (not intentionally, just out of laziness &amp; boredom)\n\nI'm really hoping that there are some easy changes I can make or else this is just stubborn menopause fat and it will budge with some perseverance.",

I was under the impression i cant go over 20 carbs, but a factor meal i ate had 16 net carbs, wich seems dangerously close to that 20 carb limit.  I also have heard the limit is actually 50.  Any advice here? Should I avoid Factor?",

I'm exercising like crazy but my triglycerides are still measured in the 100s (like 250). I don't know what to do anymore... It's definitely NOT due to inactivity or carbohydrate consumption. I do drink 3-4 shots of espresso and I do drink some low carb alcohol (like a bottle of dry red wine/week). I'm 3 years after quad coronary bypass so I'm seriously worried.. I know I was highly insulin resistant a few years ago (low HDL and even higher trigs) but my HDL is now \\~80... Any suggestions would be helpful.. Thanks in advance.",

I'd keep eating so many prepackaged keto snacks, avocados or fatty fish, nuts and cheese the calories were really high. Maybe something about the ground flax seed helps me absorb electrolytes better. There is a really great recipe for a flax muffin in a mug on the Wholesome Yum blog. I replace the egg in the recipe with an extra tablespoon of ground flax seed and three tablespoons of water, and a tablespoon of egg white. Let the flax seed mingle with the water and egg white five minutes before adding it to the rest of the recipe's ingredients in the mug. I have also found good ground chocolate flax mug cake, and flax seed pancakes. Let me know if you'd like these recipes. I hope this helps...I too was so frustrated with never feeling the higher energy level, and never being able to say \"I don't feel as hungry any more,\" like a lot of people on here do. Before the flax hack discovery... I was so hungry and obsessed with what I was going to eat next.",

I\u2019m completely sedentary, my BMR is 996 cal, and most keto macro calculators recommend 0.8g protein/kg for sedentary and 1.2-1.8g protein/kg for people who lift regularly.

    "postText": "First words out of the doctor's mouth were \"you have lost a TON of weight\". When he read a BP of 110/72, he asked \"what is your diet like\". When I told him keto, he chuckled and said \"sure as hell can't argue with these numbers. Whatever you're doing, continue!\"\n\nDown 80 pounds, exercising every day, off all BP and cholesterol meds - life is good. Link is me one year ago and this week. \n\nThanks to r/keto for all your help and support.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/v5okW3k.jpg\n\nEDIT - Dang people this blew up! A couple of things. I am not old - my dad is old! I limit carbs to 25g net or less - 130 g protien and 160 g fat. I use MFP to track my macros religiously - I've found when I try to go \"lazy\", I go over my calorie target (about 2000-2100 calories). I drink a gallon of water every day. I try to do 24 hour IMF at least once a week.",

For these people, the insulin they take is a replacement for the insulin that their body doesn't produce. You could argue that they wouldn't need insulin if they didn't eat carbs but the underlying condition is still there. This is in contrast to T2DM which is insulin resistance; the pancreas is still functioning and making insulin (usually) but the body is requiring more than it can make due to a number of reasons (high glycemic load, metabolic syndrome, etc.). Weight loss and a low carb diet can 'cure' T2DM by improving insulin insensitivity. ",

It's important that folks understand that whatever imorovement a keto diet provides will likely end when keto ends. \n\nThat said, let's not forget that, as you point out, Type II diabetes is characterized by insulin *resistance* rather than a complete inability of the pancreas to produce insulin. So I think the jury is still out on whether insulin resistance can ever reverse itself once sugar poisoning and obesity have been suspended. If  you know any literature that addresses the issue, I'd be interested to see it.",

I just wasn't sure if you understood the physiology behind the 2 types and why keto works well for T2 but not really for T1 (based off your question). I haven't really seen much research on either but I'm definitely interested as well. It's tricky trying to look at studies done with regular diets and apply the conclusions to someone keto. It's a huge confounder. More data needed! ",

If I've had excess glucose, say from treating low blood sugar (which requires that I consume glucose), I'll generally see a liver dump of glucose about 30min-1hr after going to sleep that night. Without an automatic pancreas, that goes uncorrected. T1D's have zero insulin production, so if not for the insulin pump (or shots), our blood sugar can get to dangerous levels resulting in diabetic ketoacidosis which is like going keto, but it's in the bloodstream making things all acidic and unhappy. \n",

The only way to know for sure if your high LDL is truly a risk factor is to DIRECTLY measure the counts and LDL particles types.",

A value of less than 1.000 is considered ideal. Above 2.000 is considered very high.\n\nIdeal: &lt;1000\n\nModerate: 1000-1299\n\nBorderline High: 1300-1599\n\nHigh: &gt;1600\n\n&gt; to avoid meds?\n\nInterventions that will lower LDL-C more than LDL-P include statins, estrogen replacement therapy, some antiretrovirals, and a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. Interventions that lower LDL-P more than LDL-C include fibrates, niacin, pioglitazone, omega-3 fatty acids, exercise, Mediterranean and low-carbohydrate diets. Although statins lower LDL-P, they may leave a significant number of patients above the LDL-P target.\n\n[Source](https://www.docsopinion.com/health-and-nutrition/lipids/ldl-p/)\n\nThe takeaway? Statins and other \"meds\" as you described primarily lower LDLc, which doesn't really matter. To effectively lower LDLp, which is what matters, you need to get in the gym / exercise, and take Fish Oil pills (1g EPA + DHA per day). You can try supplementing fish into your diet as well, but for purposes of mercury bio-accumulation I find that taking Fish Oil as a pill is a safer alternative. It's also easier to manage the dosage. Try these first because there is no side effect or possible downside to either.\n\nIf those don't work, niacin (vitamin B3) supplementation has been shown to work but has some mild side effects that can be unpleasant but won't kill you (vomiting, stomach pain, etc.).\n\nI don't know enough about fibrates to comment on them.

They aren\u2019t prescribed much anymore due to liver toxicity, and if they are used, they need to be closely monitored when starting out to find the line between being therapeutic and toxic.  It can still be a great tool to use before stepping up to a statin.\n\nStatins should not be entirely excluded from the medication lineup.  They are extremely useful tools that have been extensively studied and repeatedly proven to reduce risk for cardiovascular effects.  The side effects are more risky with statins than exercise or fish oil of course though, so they may not be good for a first line treatment.\n\nAnd if anyone is curious about fibrates, they have been in use for over 50 years and have been studied and proven to decrease coronary artery disease risk in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia (lowers heart attack risk if you have bad lipid numbers). Fibrates substantially decrease triglyceride numbers, while improving HDL numbers.  They don\u2019t change LDL numbers much, but current studies are showing they may increase particle size of LDLs, which is a good thing.   These are another great tool to combat cholesterol, but they also have some side effects to be aware of before taking them.  The side effects typically aren\u2019t as bad as statins though.",

That ratio is the one most correlated with coronary artery disease.  Anything above 2.0 puts you at risk.\n\nAlso, if you're worried about elevated LDL on keto,  don't be. Firstly, the formula used to estimate LDL on a standard blood test is flawed if you have low TGL.   You should use the Iranian formula instead.  Second, even if your LDL number is elevated on low carb, the LDL particles of someone on this diet tend to be benign large fluffy LDL as opposed to dangerous small dense LDL.  ",

He kept insisting on it, even giving me pamphlets.  I was so annoyed and frustrated.  What a wasted trip; his office was not exactly close to my house, either.\n\nRelated note:  Keto has really helped with the gastroenteritis!  I didn't start keto to lose weight.  I did lose a bit -- about 30 lbs -- but I wasn't obese (maybe a bit overweight).  My main concern was that I was in *pain*.  For like 15 years.  But keto has helped!  I'm not 100%, but I'm happy with how I've felt the last few years on keto.  :)",

I did that the first couple of days, and really wanted to do more. Signed up for My Fitness Pal and started logging. Started walking. Started to figure out carbs were all around me and it was a challenge staying away from them. Start out slow. Read the stuff. Read this sub for motivation, and the keto food subs for meal ideas. I am stoked with my progress, and very happy I finally started. Don't wait. Just start. Figure out the details later. \n\nAnd snaps to the OP on the progress!

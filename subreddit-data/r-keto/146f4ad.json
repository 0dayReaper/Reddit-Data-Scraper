Pretty much all of our meat based curries can be keto if eaten without rice or bread - same with our veggie based \u201csabzi\u2019s\u201d or veggie based curries like saag (spinach), gobi (cauliflower), and more! \n\nPakistani here, lost 80lbs on keto and am lucky enough to be living at home with parents that cook amazing food. As long as it\u2019s not a big bowl of biryani, pulao, etc - I\u2019m usually set to eat whatever is at home.",

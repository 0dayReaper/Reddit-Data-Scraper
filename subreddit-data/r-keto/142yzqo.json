My point is aim for volume - everyday for 30 mins/200cal (random numbers) is more efficient than 1 day go all (400cals) then feeling sore and fatigue for 2-3 days and not enjoying overall the excercise. Hope I made my point clear, as I\u2019m speaking from personal experience. Good Luck.",

            "comment": "Brilliant.  That's a superb achievement, congratulations.\n\nI second the other comments saying it's probably a good time to start exercising.  There's a couple of reasons.\n\nLoose skin.  Exercise helps and you're a big lad losing a lot of weight.  Fasting should help here too (autophagy etc).\n\nSkeletal and muscular strength (the reason we should all be exercising).  Keep on top of that lean muscle mass, stress your body, helps you stay glycogen depleted and deeper in ketosis.\n\nI'd add one word of caution.  I'm bit taller, a bit older and started a bit lighter than you but I found that exercising for me was physically challenging past a certain weight.  You are still above my personal weight limit, but everyone is different.  North of 250lbs I would get very sore back, hips and it felt like I was doing more damage than good.  Exercise is great, I would always encourage it.  But stay within your abilities at first, it'll only get better as you progress.  There's no need to injure yourself with over enthusiasm.\n\nAgain, congratulations, you have achieved remarkable results.",

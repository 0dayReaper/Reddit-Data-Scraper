I land in my macros almost every day and most of my meals are healthy. My anxiety is gone and my desire for food variety has lead me to cook more than my old lifestyle ever did. I\u2019m losing weight. Thank you all so much &lt;3",

If you are unaware of Christopher Palmers work, definitely check it out.\n\n2 weeks in is a good start, from zero to 14 days in a row, that\u2019s an infinite improvement.\n\nHowever, 6 months in, 1 yr in, it gets harder due to external factors, friends, social gatherings, rejecting invites, knowing how to dodge and navigate around your everyday life.\n\nKeep it up",

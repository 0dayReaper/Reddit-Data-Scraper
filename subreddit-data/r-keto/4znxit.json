            "comment": "Edit:. I have been getting numerous posters stating that they think my pics are fake or the weight is incorrect or that it's a \"marketing ploy\" for MyFitnessPal.\n\nThis is super shocking for me because I never expected such an awesome response to my pics. It was photo Friday so I simply wanted to share my progress. I log into MFP everyday and the give the option to share your progress photos. I shared it from their site then posted it on Facebook and on here.\n\nI have decided to add an additional pic for those who think it's fake. One the left is me this morning, on the right is from Monday morning.\n\nI started at 252 and today I am 226. That's 26 lbs lost in total after my weigh in this morning no more, no less. Thank you all for the wonderful comments and 26 lbs from now I'm hoping the difference will be just as shocking!\n\nhttp://imgur.com/4qwq1mD",

Same weight of muscle is a lot less volume than the same weight of fat. So if you are converting your body to a smaller heavier shape you may not lose ANY weight at all but look totally different. You could even GAIN weight and look totally different. ",

Some days I prepare a salad with grilled chicken, shrimp, or ham and ranch dressing. I love making deviled eggs with bacon. A pot of chili goes a long way and is pretty filling for lunch. Occasionally if I'm in a rush and don't have time to make lunch, I go to McDonalds and order a burger without the bun or a sub shop and order a sub wrapped in lettuce instead of a hoagie roll. For dinner usually a meat saut\u00e9ed in olive oil with a veggie. I love chicken with cheese wrapped in bacon, meatloaf, I even make a pretty delicious \"fried chicken\" using breading that I bought from holdthecarbs.com. Sorry I know you asked for my favorite keto meal but I have so many lol.",

            "comment": "People saying looks like more because it does and probably is, 20 pounds was my first goal. I had estimated my body fat percentage when I started, by the time I lost 20 pounds I bought a 5 or 10 dollar caliper on Amazon. It isn't perfect but it gave me a pretty good idea of the transformation. I can't recommend this enough to people, track body fat percentage and scale but the bf is so much more informative.\n\nAnyway, I found I had lost more like 23-25 pounds of fat with some measurement tolerances. That means I actually put on several pounds of lean mass relative to my start weight. Where as most diets total weight loss includes the catabolic loss of lean mass as well so just looking at total weight loss kind of penalizes you for gaining lean mass. Now if you also consider I probably lost 3-7 pounds of water weight in that first week it means I put more like 5-10 pounds of actual lean mass on. This makes a huge difference in your body shape because you most likely lost say 30 pounds but you've been building lean mass on top so it looks like more because it is!\n\nGreat job",

On Youtube there are videos where people have posted their 7 day keto meals and also hundreds of recipes on the internet. I played around with it until I found what works for me. \n\n\nFor breakfast generally bacon and eggs (sometimes cheese or heavy cream in the eggs) if I tire of bacon I have a sausage patty or some ham. I make omelets if I have the time and on the weekends for a treat I make a sausage quiche which is eggs, sausage, cheese, heavy cream and seasonings mixed together and baked or keto pancakes with sugar free syrup. \n\n\nLunch: A salad with grilled chicken, shrimp, or ham and ranch dressing. Deviled eggs with bacon are good. Also if I'm in a rush I'll do a bunless burger from McDonald's or sub with a lettuce wrap instead of bread.\n\n\nDinner: Meat and veggies. I usually saut\u00e9 the meat in olive oil for added fat. Chicken wrapped in bacon, meatloaf, keto pizza, homemade burgers and I make the best fried chicken tenders, shrimp and fish using breading that I bought from holdthecarbs.com.\n\n\nMake sure you get in enough water and watch your electrolytes. There's more info about that in the faqs. Good luck and hope to see your progress pics soon!!\n",

I researched keto and found that I could still eat a lot of good tasting foods and lose weight. I started by cutting out the fast food. Yes, it was a mental battle to keep myself from pulling into McDonalds or wherever everyday but with time it got easier. I plan a day ahead because my taste buds might change if I plan to far in advance. I look up the nutritional information for what I planned to eat and had everything figured out for the next day. Over time you will get a feel for the numbers and not have to plan so heavily. There are a ton of recipes in the sidebar and over time you will learn how to mix and match. Also, if you cannot always cook you can still eat out. Most fast food places can do a burger without the bun or a sub wrapped in lettuce. remember nothing taste as good as skinny and you'll be fine : )",

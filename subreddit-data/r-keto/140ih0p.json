    "postText": "in the past whenever i have \"fallen off\" any \"wagon\" i treated it like a one-way-only path. in other words, if i ate a dessert or pizza, i'd throw up my hands and figure well that's it. \n\nmy tip today is if you are someone who tracks your food intake (like i am), if you overeat, write down exactly what you ate. treat that part of it like any other day. \n\ni chose to eat a non-keto dinner friday night and i believe it was a very good idea to put exactly what i ate onto my food tracker. it helped me see what calories and macros were in the food and gave me a realistic picture of what i ate. \n\nnext day i ate as i normally do. i had no inclination to sat well the hell with it i messed up. i didn't mess up. i ate more/differently and then went back to my normal routine.",

Even if I have to go back and roughly reconstruct something like a vacation weekend or family party. When I\u2019ve had to reconstruct, I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s often the case that the meal where I thought I stepped \u201cway over the line\u201d was actually no big deal, maybe even within my macros. The problem was what happened after I decided I was over the line. \n\nThat all or nothing mentality just ruins me. \n\nSo I try to sit down and log as soon as possible, no matter what. It helps me stay accountable and to reset.",

If I know I may indulge (birthday party, big game, etc) I try to fast the day before and break my fast just before the event.  And then try to averge out over the week",

One of the most useful habits I have now is if I do eat something unhelpful I don\u2019t throw the whole day away with more unhelpful food and \u2018start tomorrow\u2019; I start immediately. Had some hot fries? No biggie. Accept it, and eat something keto as my next meal. Sometimes I\u2019ve been able to even stop halfway through the unhelpful food and switch to helpful in the same meal! \n\nPreviously it was eat something unhelpful - oh well today is a write off so I\u2019ll spend the entire day eating unhelpful shit - next day I feel like shit with bulk carb cravings - eat more unhelpful shit to chase the dopamine - I\u2019ll start again tomorrow, or Monday, or the first of the month. \n\nSo glad I\u2019m breaking that cycle!",

You know, the other carb?  Starches get metabolized into glucose.        \n     \nWe are a ketogenic diet sub so we concern ourselves with carbs.  Your statement is too broad.  I suspect you meant to stay away from \"added sugar\" which would make more sense.     \n                    \nI am just trying to help clarify and  be a little more exact in our language because there is absolutely nothing wrong with sugar.  Our application of sugar can be screwed up, but that ain't the sugar's fault.    \n    \nBut to stay away from \"sugar\" would mean eating zero carb and although that is certainly your choice, it's not something we subscribe to as a sub.       \n      \nPlus, I love me some tomatoes.  And cabbage :)",

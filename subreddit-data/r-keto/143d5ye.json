    "postText": "I drink a lot of this product, specifically the raspberry flavor. I love the tartness and it helps me to drink enough water, I also use 2 LMNT packets a day. I was just prescribed a medical device that has a warning to not consumer over 500mg of vitamin C because it can cause false high readings. Looking for a water enhancer that tastes similar to the Ultima Rasberry, but without the added vitamin C.",

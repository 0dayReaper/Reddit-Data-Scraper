    "postText": "Full Disclosure:\n\n* I don\u2019t have extravagant or complicated cooking sessions.\n* I keep things as simple as possible to help save me time so the things I eat daily are not complicated.\n* I\u2019m also not a picky eater at all and enjoy the taste of everything.\n\n#1. An ~~apple~~ avocado a day keeps the doctor away\n\n* I used to avoid avocados because of their high fat content, but now I often eat one avocado a day, usually as the first thing to break my fast (\u201cbreakfast\u201d) and it\u2019s shockingly filling. They are quite literally, the perfect low carb, keto-friendly food. They have very few net carbs, lots of fiber, and it\u2019s mostly just fat. Not just any fat though, it has a magnificent fat profile of mostly monounsaturated fats. (This is the stuff olive oil has a lot of too.)\n\n* I eat avocados with some...\n * [Salt &amp; Pepper \\(pictured here\\)](http://i.imgur.com/Ewk66FF.jpg) or\n * Soy Sauce or\n * Lemon Pepper\n\n**How to buy and rotate avocados so you always have some ripe ones:**\n\n* I buy 6-8 avocados at a time because it takes several days for them to ripen and I like to have a good supply.\n* An easy way to check if they\u2019re ripe without having to smash the skin is to simply push down on the brown stem (if there is one). If it goes down, it\u2019s ready.\n* If too many avocados are ripening and you want to slow down the process, throw them in the fridge! As simple as that.\n* With that trick in mind, I usually have 5-10 avocados in the fridge and 5-10 over the counter so that I have a constant supply.\n\n**If you have too many avocados that have ripened, make guacamole! Guamacole is super easy to make!**\n\n* Mash up all the ripe avocados together\n* Add some lime\n* Add some minced up cilantro and you\u2019re good to go!\n* If you\u2019re at a (mexican) restaurant and they serve chips and guacamole, tell them you don\u2019t want the chips, but order some chicken or steak with it and dip it into the guac! Delicious.\n\n#2. Eggs\n\nNormally I eat 2-3 eggs, a few times a week. They too, like avocados, are a very keto-friendly food. They have zero carbs and are highly nutritious with an excellent amino acid (protein) profile.\n\n[Pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/VsZZOxX.jpg) are some fluffy hard boiled eggs with some salt and pepper. Simple and delicious. If I\u2019m boiling eggs for the day, I will boil some extra ones at the same time to keep for egg salad (recipe below).\n\n**Other keto friendly ways I prepare eggs?**\n\n* Scrambled or sunny side up, fried with coconut oil.\n* Omelette with cheese/veggies\n* Poached eggs (w/ Hollandaise sauce) (Basically \u201ceggs benedict\u201d without the English muffins.)\n* Egg salad (below!)\n\n#3. Egg Salad\n\nThis makes for a nice lunch idea that\u2019s easy to customize and takes barely a few minutes to make because you just mash the ingredients together.\n\n* [Before (Just soft boiled eggs and avocado)](http://i.imgur.com/ujs445F.jpg)\n* [After \\(mash up eggs, avocado and mayonnaise\\)](http://i.imgur.com/fOPn4Th.jpg)\n\n**Recipe: Mash up all these ingredients together:**\n\n* 1 Avocado\n* 2 Soft-Boiled Eggs (hard boiled works too but soft is creamier)\n* 1 tablespoon mayonnaise\n* Optional: add garlic salt and pepper\n* Optional: add some shredded Cheddar Cheese\n* Optional: add cayenne to taste for spicyness\n\n#4. Simply Delicious Vegetables\n\nThe following are common, non-starchy vegetables that I eat regularly:\n\n* [Asparagus &amp; Brussels Sprouts](http://i.imgur.com/xsMIkd6.jpg)\n* [Broccoli &amp; Cauliflower](http://i.imgur.com/kyR51l4.jpg)\n\n**How do I prepare these guys? Easy! I bake them!**\n\nDon\u2019t be scared of ovens, people, it\u2019s stupid-easy to bake things! Just follow the simple steps below:\n\n* Preheat the oven to 400F.\n* In a small bowl, mix a few tablespoons of **Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Soy Sauce together.**\n* Optional: add some minced garlic, maybe some ginger depending on the veggies used.\n* Put the veggies in a big bowl and pour this small bowl of oil and soy sauce into the veggies and mix it well.\n* Put the veggies on a pan with Parchment Paper for 400F for 15 minutes.\n* And that\u2019s it! Ta-daaaa! See how easy it was?\n* I personally like the EVOO and Soy Sauce, but you could also just put it all with BUTTER, too. That\u2019s keto friendly, too. Oftentimes the veggies are actually there to act as a carrier for the butter.\n\n#5. Blueberries! The Keto-Candy.\n\n[Frozen blueberries are my favorite little snack!](http://i.imgur.com/GTbRzYg.jpg) I love the crunch they provide and since they\u2019re so cold, I can\u2019t eat a bunch of them because then I\u2019ll get brain freeze. This also reminds me to treat berries like candy, so I eat them sparingly and usually NOT daily. When they\u2019re on sale, I stock up on a bunch of them, wash them and keep them in the freezer. (I eat raspberries and strawberries sometimes too, but blueberries are my jam, without the jam.)\n\n#6. Baked Fish\n\nFish is something I have ~3x a week that I\u2019m always trying to eat more of. On the days that I don\u2019t eat fish, I take a fish oil capsule to get more Omega 3\u2019s in my diet.\n\n* [This was a fillet of Alaskan Salmon surrounded by potatoes for the non-keto guests.](http://i.imgur.com/R686JDM.jpg) :)\n* [I was at a friends and I suggested we bake some fish \\(tilapia\\), brussels sprouts and mushrooms and they didn\u2019t even know we were eating a totally keto-friendly meal!](http://i.imgur.com/UmZV8cJ.jpg)\n\n**Here\u2019s how I bake fish (you could do this to fillets or whole fish):**\n\n* Preheat the oven to 375F\n* Rub salt, pepper, olive oil, lemon and blackened fish seasoning on both sides of the fish.\n* Bake at 375F for 25-35 minutes.\n* Done! How easy is that!\n\n**Other fish choices:** I don\u2019t eat tuna anymore because Wild Sardines in Olive Oil and Smoked Sprats are superior in every way. They are lower on the food chain than tuna and don\u2019t accumulate toxins (such as mercury) and have a superior Omega 3 to 6 ratio! (Btw, I used to buy Riga Sprats but turns out they are stored in rapeseed oil, which is a terrible vegetable oil to eat, not only cause rape is bad, but it\u2019s mostly bad fats\u2026 so no more of that brand!)\n\n#7. Salmon and Cream Cheese (And Avocado!?)\n\n* [In this photo I put salmon, cream cheese, avocado, green onions and some aleppo pepper on a big piece of lettuce to make a dank meal.](http://i.imgur.com/jH2zTVF.jpg) \n* Normally people eat the above ingredients sandwiched between a bagel. But you can\u2019t have a bagel on a keto diet. Bagels are just bread. Fuck bread. Why would I want that stuff getting in the way of the deliciousness in the middle?\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Smoked Salmon Lox\n* Cream Cheese\n* Salt and Pepper to taste\n* Optional: Chopped Green Onions (Scallions)\n* Optional: Capers\n* Optional: Avocado\n* Optional: If you want a \u201ccarrier\u201d, you could put it all on a piece of lettuce.\n\n#8. Cheese and Olives\n\nI\u2019ve been eating [this Kerrygold Dubliner Irish cheese](http://i.imgur.com/p4De4mo.jpg) as a standalone snack. I love to get a big knife and make extremely thin slices of these. The taste is so complex and satisfying. (They are available on Costco. And speaking of Kerrygold brand, by the way, their Irish butter tastes really good too. All their products come from grass-fed cows.)\n\nI may or may not eat this cheese with some olives. Olives have almost no net carbs and have a great fat profile, so they are a great little keto-friendly snack. I love the ones in brine.\n\n#9. Cream Cheese and Bastirma (seasoned, air-dried cured beef)\n\nOne of my favorite dairy things is to get [cream cheese and mix it with some Armenian cured deli meat called Bastirma.](http://i.imgur.com/PRGjonz.jpg) This is one of those foods that are not well known if you\u2019re not familiar with the culture, but it\u2019s highly spiced, the slices are extremely thin and delicious with some cream cheese.\n\n**Here are some other Middle Eastern Foods that are keto friendly:**\n\nSince my father is Lebanese-Armenian and my mother is Armenian-Armenian, I know about some foods that others may not know about that are very low carb and these are my random faves:\n\n* [Lebni / Labneh \\(Strained yogurt\\)](http://i.imgur.com/CHfi64w.jpg)\n * This is a type of kefir cheese, made in a similar process as Greek Yogurt, but it tastes much more tart, like sour cream. Traditionally it\u2019s spread on a plate and drizzled with olive oil and topped with some dried mint.  I personally think it\u2019s dank as fuck.\n* [Sujuk / Soujoukh / Yershik](http://i.imgur.com/kTZKT95.png)\n * This is type of highly spiced, dried beef sausage that you could find at your local international market as well, probably in the deli section. I love to eat them with cream cheese.\n\n**Note:** One of the main drawbacks of deli meat, or highly processed meats is that their protein becomes inferior and a lot of important minerals (like potassium and magnesium) are lost as well, so I don\u2019t make them my main source of protein.\n\n#10. Nuts: Macadamia\u2019s and Almonds\n\n* As you know, when one is on a low carb diet, they should replace those calories with fat and nuts are predominantly high in fat. The top two nuts that are very low in carbs AND have a very healthy fat profile are macadamia\u2019s and almonds!\n\n* [Macadamia Nuts that are Dry Roasted with Sea Salt](http://i.imgur.com/BQSWxxn.jpg) are one of my favorite snacks. They taste like butter balls that are perfectly salted. (~20cals each)\n* I *love* [these Wasabi &amp; Soy Sauce Almonds.](http://i.imgur.com/5R4Huha.jpg) I always get a pound of these that last me the month.\n* [These Marcona Almonds with Rosemary](http://i.imgur.com/fOgGA9G.jpg) are a bit pricey, but have an incredibly luxurious taste. Marcona almonds are fried in olive oil, by the way.\n\n* **Warning for those trying to lose weight:** Nuts are high in calories and it\u2019s easy to \u201caccidentally\u201d eat a few hundred calories of these if you are just munching mindlessly. Even if you practice severe carbohydrate restriction, eating more calories than you need can result in fat gain. (I still use MyFitnessPal when I want to ensure weight loss even on keto, but that's just me, YMMV)\n\nYou could have other nuts too, like cashews and peanuts for example. But as dank as they are, I can\u2019t go to town on them cause they\u2019re somewhat higher in net carbs, so I eat them very sparingly and infrequently. If I\u2019m going to have peanuts, I usually opt for peanut butter, actually. And on occasion, I go for cashew butter. [\\(relevant peanut butter related meme\\)](http://i.imgur.com/GZO0Hfu.jpg)\n\n#11. Milk Alternatives for when I want a creamy drink\n\n**[Unsweetened flax, coconut, soy, hemp, cashew, almond milks.](http://i.imgur.com/FajoKSy.jpg) (We live in good times to have access to such variety!)**\n\n* Note that ALL of these must specifically say **\u201cUNSWEETENED\u201d** on their label. The beauty of these are that they are only 30-45 calories per cup.\n\n* **Coconut Milk:** In the summertime, there\u2019s something so brisk and refreshing about coconut milk. (It reminds me of summer, probably thanks to all those dark tanning products that smelled like coconut oil.)\n* **Hemp and Flax and Cashew milks:** I have only tried these a couple times, they are a bit more fatty, creamy, thick and I like them.\n* **Almond milk** is my favorite. Some people don\u2019t like it at all and that bewilders me, but\u2026 I like it and it\u2019s a yummy drink to me. I sometimes will heat up a cup and drink it *hot.*\n* **Soy Milk** is my go to when I\u2019m looking for a more hearty drink (clocking in at 100cals/cup), I really like unsweetened soy milk. It\u2019s also great to add to your tea so it\u2019s like a chai-latte. Protip: If you live near some Asian stores, you can find unfiltered soy milk which tastes like the real thing. But you must make sure it\u2019s not sweetened.\n\n#12. Arugula Salad\n\n[This is stupid easy to make.](http://i.imgur.com/GdU98Eg.jpg) I just added arugula and avocado and salt &amp; pepper and olive oil. How easy is that? Really easy.  You could also do something similar with spinach. Loves me some spinach.\n\n#13. Keto-Friendly Foods On The Go\n\nIf I\u2019m on the go, I usually don\u2019t have hunger and can get away with several hours without eating but\u2026 if I do...\n\n* I like Quest Bars, specifically the Choc Chip Cookie Dough flavor. They are the only truly keto-friendly bars that I know of. (Edit: Costco carries Kirkland Protein Bars that are similar to these apparently and much cheaper!)\n* Sunflower seeds (I love the cracked pepper version) found at most gas stations, are quite a good snack if you like spitting sunflower shells.\n* If you\u2019re not a fan of spitting sunflower shells, already-shelled-for-you roasted and salted sunflower seeds/kernels are also pretty delicious too. These also are found at gas stations. Just make sure they don\u2019t have added sugar.\n\n**I also take an avocado with me sometimes. Here\u2019s how to eat a ripe avocado without any tools:**\n\n* Bite the skin at the top to remove it and spit it out.\n* Squeeze the avocado out from the bottom up. Eat it as it comes out the top hole.\n* Eventually the seed will come out as well and you just keep squeezing it out into your mouth and into the trash or straight into the trash.\n* **Fair warning:** Keep the avocado in a place that won\u2019t get mashed in your bag by other things or else it will make a mess. Ask me how I know. :P (Maybe even put it in its own zip lock bag or something)\n\n#14. Mineral Management and Daily Supplements\n\nMineral management is especially important on a ketogenic diet to prevent feeling fatigue (especially before strength or endurance training) or if you\u2019re not feeling well while in ketosis. These are the following things I take:\n\n* **Multivitamin:** I supplement with a daily one-a-day multivitamin to cover my bases.\n* **Sodium &amp; Potassium:** It\u2019s no coincidence that many foods I eat are somewhat higher in sodium overall, and that\u2019s because the kidneys excrete more than usual while in ketosis and so I make up for it with the higher sodium intake. But, to not get too much sodium, I use \u201cLoSalt\u201d instead of regular salt because it\u2019s more potassium in it and half the sodium (salt) which makes for a better balance. I also drink bone broth almost daily.\n* **Magnesium:** Two of [these magnesium pills a day](https://www.amazon.com/Doctors-Absorption-Magnesium-Elemental-240-Count/dp/B000BD0RT0/) (400mg) for 20 days will help stabilize magnesium levels. This improves almost every cellular process in your body (especially important for sleep and muscle cramps). This is doubly important on keto due to the kidneys excreting faster than usual.\n* **Fish Oil:** If I did not eat fish that day, I\u2019ll take 1-2 capsules of fish oil which has lots of omega 3\u2019s in each capsule. \n * **Advisory:** Many fish oil brands will say \u201c1200mg\u201d but really, only 300mg of it will only be Omega 3 fatty acids. So read the labels to make sure you're getting one with high DHA/EPA!\n* **Protein:** If I haven\u2019t ate much protein or I had a particularly hard strength training day, I will drink a scoop of [vegan protein powder](https://truenutrition.com/p-1169-vegan-protein-optimizer-formula-1lb.aspx) and add raw cacao and chia seeds in a blender bottle. The unflavored one tastes really blah but the chocolate or french vanilla flavored ones are a good powder that gets the job done with minimal fuss.\n\n#15. Special mention for Fiber\n\nIf I\u2019m feeling like I ate too many things that don\u2019t have any fiber (read: meat, cheese, etc) and feel constipated, then I will have 1-2 teaspoons of organic psyllium husk mixed in water. It\u2019s pure fiber which causes me to poop gloriously sometime later that day.\n\n**ProTip:** Nowadays, if I\u2019m going traveling or camping, I will take a zip lock bag of this stuff with me and my bowel movements won\u2019t feel disrupted from the traveling and it works incredibly well. ([relevant meme](http://i.imgur.com/OAgPvtS.jpg))\n\n###Well, that wraps it up\n\n* Now you know what I eat on a regular basis. All this info above was from a blog post that I published yesterday titled [\"What I Actually Eat\"](http://antranik.org/what-i-actually-eat/) but since self promotion is not allowed on this sub, I took the hour here to make it reddit-friendly.\n* If you're missing an ingredient or curious to know exactly which product I use, there are a billion links (mostly on Amazon) in the official article.\n* If you like my writing style, here's a link to the [beginners guide I created for the keto diet](https://redd.it/4vhrv5) that was very well received. Hope that helps!\n\n###Edit:\n\nThis post blew up and I'm glad this was valuable to many of you! I thank YOU for adding VALUE with your nifty comments! (It's not often I am greeted with so many excellent comments... This sub is a great support group!) Oh and thanks for the gold, internet-friend.",

            "comment": "Hi OP \n\nSo permit me to add to your cooking arsenal - \n\nYou've neglected two great things, not that I blame you cause you likely have traumatic childhood memories of them. \n\nEggplant and Zucchini. The things you can do with them are amazing. \n\nChop both of them up together, add a bell pepper, some onion and grape tomatoes. Toss it all in the slow cooker with some salt for 4 hours on high and bam - Ratatouille. \n\nOr grab an eggplant, slice it in half, and scoop the inside out (leave enough so it still remains eggplant shaped though!). Blend that with...well whatever you want. I prefer a tomato, garlic, onion and mushrooms. Meanwhile rub the eggplant halves with olive oil, add some salt and pepper and bake them a bit. Add the filling back to the halves after an hour, keep baking. Boom - Sleeping Imam. \n\nOr take some chinese eggplants. Peel them, cut the top off, slice them in half. Heat some  olive oil and then fry them a bit till they're golden. Set aside. Slice up an onion and mince some garlic. Fry that till the onions are golden, add some Mint, Turmeric and salt to that. Put the eggplants back in. Add half a cup of water and cook on medium for 10-15. Here's the tricky part - [Add some Kashk](https://www.google.com/search?q=Kashk&amp;newwindow=1&amp;rlz=1C1ASUM_enRU483RU483&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1902&amp;bih=932&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi57aqw-YjPAhXEwiYKHbf7BL0Q_AUIBygC) which is an Iranian/Middle Eastern/Kavkaz/Turkish whey cheese. It tastes pretty good by itself. Ok use greek yogurt if you can't find it, but if you can find that Armenian deli meat I bet you have this stuff as well. Mash the eggplant-onion-kashk with a potato masher. Add some crushed walnuts End result? Kashk-o bademjan.  Eat it with celery, like a dip. Or just...you know eat it. \n\nOr if you take an eggplant and roast it on the grill, mash it up with some tahini you've got babaganoush. Also good on celery. Or all by itself. \n\nZucchini can be used to make bread, and more amazingly, brownies. \n\nWhat else can I recommend. Oh yeah.  \n\nTake raw cauliflower, and blend it to a sorta chunky texture. Stir fry it. Cauliflower rice. I add jalapeno slices to mine, or a small can of chipotles in adobo. \n\nTake a head of cauliflower and get the good bits off the stalk. Dump it in a stock pot of boiling water and cook it for as long as you want, as long as that's longer than 6 minutes. Well done really. Strain it, then dry it really well with paper towels. Toss that in your blender with some cream cheese, garlic and onion powder and salt. Blend till it's paste like. Much finer than the riced cauliflower texture. You now have a mashed potato substitute. \n\nThe fine goat cheese chevre is a wonderful thing. Trader Joe's sell bags of little 1 ounce medallions if you take your morning avocado and mash it up with that cheese it's really good. \n\nSpeaking of Trader Joe, grab some of their cold brew coffee concentrate and mix it up with almond milk. It's a good combo. TJs also has some nice soy meat things if you're ever looking for lighter alternatives. Oh and their frozen Palak Paneer is also good. Palak Paneer is just good in general though. \n\nIf you're looking for stuff to drink and you don't mind tart flavors, cold brew hibiscus   tea with a cinnamon stick tossed in is really nice. Hibiscus is said to be a diuretic as well and my personal non medical experience seems to show it's true so you might not want to drink it in large quantities in the woods. \n\nOh yeah if you're looking for something else to do with fish, grab some cheap stuff like tilapia or cod. Turn it to paste in your blender, add an egg, some riced cauliflower, green onions and dijon mustard (the kind with seeds!) and then make patties out of it. Fishburgers! \n\nAnyways, good luck with cooking. It's always fun to slip people zucchini brownies for the first time as well =). ",

Instead of straight almond flour, I use 60% almond flour, 20% flax meal, 10% whey protein isolate, and 10% bulk wheat bran (mostly fiber), by weight.\n\nTwo parts cheese to one part \"flour\" mix; one egg per flour part; 56g cream cheese per part; salt and spices to taste; one teaspoon of baking powder per part. Bake at 425 rolled thin on parchment paper. Best low-carb cracker/bread substitute I've found yet. ",

Likewise, if taken too often* (it doesn't sound like you are taking it that often, this is just for discussion's sake) it can begin to dry the intestines out which will also cause impacted masses and slow movement. There is reason to believe that this will eventually create a habitual need for psyllium.  \n  \nI have to confess that science on this subject is very soft, so this comes down to physiology and deciding what is prudent for you. Seeing that there was no such concern with chia, I decided it was prudent to use it instead. However, it is hard to argue against something that is working for you, so hopefully I've provided some insight and you can make the decision that is right for you.\n  \n*Neither of these terms are well defined.",

Once the moisture in the mucous membrane is gone, the psyllium has nothing to create the gel it needs to become and it starts to become an impacted mass which has to be moved by bulking fiber, which will mean more psyllium. This is also theorized as why pain killers and certain other medications cause constipation, the liver cannibalizes fluid from the mucous membranes to filter the massive reaction it has to the medication, which dries up the system.  \n  \nAgain, I would classify the science behind this as \"soft\", but the reasoning is sound given our understanding of physiology.\n  \n/u/heyt00ts11 was asking for an ELI5, this might suffice. If not, I would be happy to give some more, but this is simple and well stated.  \n  \nThanks!",

Place them in the freeze for an hour or so until hard then transfer to a ziplock bag or similar.\n\nIf you like Kiwi, you can cut them in small pieces and freeze them like you with your blueberries. Delicious frozen treat (but don't eat too many).",

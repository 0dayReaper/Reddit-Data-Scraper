First picture was taken about 2 years ago. Started keto 4/1/2013 after an all day binge so terrible for me it made me reconsider my entire life. (A dozen doughnuts, a dozen bagels, and 2 tubs of cream cheese). Next photo was ~6 months later, then another 6 months, then yesterday morning. \n\nSo weight loss slowed down the last year (only 45 pounds in a year) but I also started lifting around 1 year ago, and it took a good 4-5 months to get my diet dialed in just right where I'm not going insane with hunger and I'm not binge eating every other week.",

Getting her skin removed around her chin, arms, legs, and stomach will cost around 10k *without insurance. \n\nHer insurance will help pay for part (~60%) of the skin removal surgery when they deem it medically necessary. Right now, her skin is healthy and the removal of it is elective surgery. Her doctor referred her to a counselor to talk about how she can make her surgery medically necessary.\n\nShe hasn't discussed what she needs to do in order to have insurance cover it, but I'm kind of afraid to know.",

He has a scar from chest to belly button and all the way around his lower abdomen.  The recovery was a long and painful process.  His weight loss inspired me, and after losing some myself I asked his advice about the skin.  \n\nHe said to wear it like a badge.  He told me how he was ashamed his whole life, ashamed he was fat, ashamed of the skin, and then ashamed of the surgical scars.  He told me that the shame will not go away with surgery.  It only went away, he said, when he decided to stop being ashamed.  \n\nYou don't need to pay five grand and go through the physical pain.  You did it.  You lost weight.  You're losing more.  Let people look.  Go to the beach and have fun and be proud of yourself.  Your body tells a story of triumph.  A beautiful story.  Embrace it.",

                    "comment": "Keto is another variation of Atkins (low carb). The name comes from '[ketosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis)', which is the metabolic 'fat-burning' state your body switches to once it doesn't enough carbs to metabolize into energy, using fat as fuel instead, therefore faster weight loss. \n\n&gt; Ketosis /k\u0268\u02c8to\u028as\u0268s/ is a metabolic state where most of the body's energy supply comes from ketone bodies in the blood, in contrast to a state of glycolysis where blood glucose provides most of the energy. It is characterised by serum concentrations of ketone bodies over 0.5 millimolar with low and stable levels of insulin and blood glucose.[1][2] It is almost always generalized with hyperketonemia, that is, an elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood throughout the body. Ketone bodies are formed by ketogenesis when liver glycogen stores are depleted (or from metabolising medium-chain triglycerides[3]). The main ketone bodies used for energy are acetoacetate and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate,[4] and the levels of ketone bodies are regulated mainly by insulin and glucagon.[5] Most cells in the body can use both glucose and ketone bodies for fuel, and during ketosis free fatty acids and glucose synthesis (gluconeogenesis) fuel the remainder.\n&gt; \n&gt; During the usual overnight fast the body's metabolism naturally switches into ketosis, and will switch back to glycolysis after a carbohydrate-rich meal. Longer-term ketosis may result from fasting or staying on a low-carbohydrate diet, and deliberately induced ketosis serves as a medical intervention for intractable epilepsy.[6] **In glycolysis higher levels of insulin promote storage of body fat and block release of fat from adipose tissues, while in ketosis fat reserves are readily released and consumed.[5][7] For this reason ketosis is sometimes referred to as the body's \"fat burning\" mode.**",

I'm still very much obese with a BMI of 34.8. The fact that I have so far to still go is amazing, because if I'm feeling this good now, I cannot imagine how awesome it will be to be at a normal BMI.

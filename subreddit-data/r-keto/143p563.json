After gaining 50lb of it back over the last 2 years I went back on keto in March.\n\nI have been consistently under 20g of carbs daily since March.\n\nMy morning fasted blood glucose is always between 115-130 and my ketones are always between 0.7-1.5 however I just had a physical and my A1C came back @ 4.9% \n\nHow is it possible to have a fasting glucose lvls of a pre-diabetic or even full diabetic yet have an  A1C of under 5?  Im not on any meds by the way.",

For those with metabolic syndrome advancing toward type 2 it\u2019s a considerable difference. Myself I\u2019m often going as high as 150 many mornings while I spend the rest of the day in high normal ranges and even drop to the low 90s toward the evening.",

A 4.9 A1c is great, I would not be overly concerned about the fasting. \n\nHowever, I suspect that high fastings are probably a sign of fat stored in the liver.",

Basically if you're consistently low carb your body feels it's okay to not spend energy fighting glucose, because it's confident you're not going to spike it with abnormal consumption.  This is a good thing.\n\nRegardless of this, that measurement alone isn't very telling.  Triglycerides?  A1c?  HOMA-IR score?  My glucose is 110-120 every test, and I couldn't be happier with the big picture.",

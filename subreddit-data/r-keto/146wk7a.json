I\u2019ve been stuck for 4 months at the same weight until about two weeks ago when pounds just started falling off. Whole time I was stuck though I was still dropping pants sizes. Keto is weird like that, don\u2019t let not seeing the scale move make you think you aren\u2019t making progress, you still are! I\u2019ve seen people use string to measure and tape the string to the wall, a new one every week or so so they can physically see the difference. It\u2019s a cool way to see and be reminded of progress. I personally just know it\u2019s happening as I can feel my pants getting looser every time I get a new pair and I used to have to wear my Fanny pack on the very last chain link but now I can go like 8 links up. Good luck though, you sound like you are doing great!",

I\u2019ve been on Keto for almost a year now and I\u2019ve been stuck at the same weight for the last 5 weeks.  \n\nI personally don\u2019t track my Macros and really only pay attention to my total carb intake.  I honestly need to read more about macros to fully understand why my targets should be.  I\u2019ve lost 102 pounds since I\u2019ve started this journey, with only lowering my carb intake to approx 15 grams on any given day.  \n\nOne of the other comments I read indicated using a string to measure your waist versus getting on the scale.  I think this is a brilliant idea and wish I would have did this when I was 353 pounds to see the difference at 251 pounds.  \n\nPersonally I think that I need to track my Macros as many indicate, which might help me break through this plateau.\n\nDoes anyone know if it might be beneficial to kick myself out of Ketosis(which hasn\u2019t happened in a year) to break through a plateau?",

            "comment": "When you say fasting, are you talking about 'Time Restricted Feeding' in where you only eat in a 8 hour or shorter window?  Or are you talking about true fasting of 24 hours or more?  \n\nThe metabolic changes that kick off with true fasting begin at about 18 hours and ramp up from there and peak at about the 50 hour mark.\n\nFor example, I do a 60 hour fast once a week, I've been doing it for many many years.  I recently bought a keto mojo gadget and it says that my usual ketone levels are only .5 to .8.  However when I fast I hit 1.6 at the 36 hour mark.\n\nA 36 hour fast is dead easy, its just from dinner one day, all through the next day, and resume eating at breakfast on the third day.  Once you can do that without a problem, then try a 48 hour fast, then to breakfast on the 4th day (60 hour fast).\n\nMy limit is the 60 hour fast, and I have a heck of a time sleeping on that last night.  On the other hand I don't even notice a 36 hour fast.\n\nExtended fasts of 48 hours and more do profound things to your body, like - your healthspan is going be quite a bit longer than it would otherwise be kind of profound.\n\nGood luck.",

In that time I\u2019d up the protein and lower the fat. Like 150g of protein and what ever is left in fat. \n\nAgain the goal is to make sure the internal machinery is firing correctly. After the week or two at maintenance drop the fats a little lower while keeping the protein high. This will help your muscles recover and burn through the stored body fat.",

I also started up the occasional extended fast about once a month.  It\u2019s been a couple of months now and at my lowest the scale has touched 172 and about 21% body fat.\n\nSo I think the occasional break can be good for you both mentally and physically, but definitely review everything and make sure you\u2019re checking all the boxes, life has a way of sneaking things in over time.",

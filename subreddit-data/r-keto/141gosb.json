He hasn't really been tracking much but sticks to veggies, meat, and cheese. I've been fasting from 6pm-10am but wondering if it matters when that fasting window hits?",

However the 1 meal obviously is a longer fast which would generally mean more time without some type of insulin spike. And yes you still get a response; albeit not as high as sugar with protein and fats.",

That\u2019s why most people do 16:8 IF.  One meal a day (OMAD) would be an even bigger IF window. \n\nThere are some IF subs you can check out that are more informed about IF. \n\nFor me, keto makes IF easy as I\u2019ve lost a lot of cravings for late night snacks.",

Was it just a minor, but perceptible change, or was it drastic enough to attribute keto to be the cause for the change?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your comments. Definitely learnt a lot!",

            "comment": "I started keto in March of last year while I was dealing with peroneal tendinitis and it was EXCRUCIATINGLY painful to put any pressure on my left foot. It was so bad I would feel it way up in my calf and at one point, thought I might\u2019ve had a blood clot. The inflammation was that painful. Around 6 months in, the pain was a quarter of what it had been. I noticed the swelling had gone down significantly, and only hurt after wearing tight shoes.\n\nKeep in mind I\u2019d tried pain relievers, foot braces, creams, R.I.C.E, you name it. Nothing worked. Now, if I wear shoes with no support or things that are really flat, it hurts the next day, but it doesn\u2019t hurt consistently or at the level it did before.\n\nI also struggled with irregular menstruation from PCOS, and would skip cycles constantly. I wouldn\u2019t have one for months, and when I did, they were so painful that I was bed bound. The amount I was losing would put me in the hospital. It too levelled out around the same amount of time, and I began to get one regularly with half the pain and &gt;!blood!&lt;.\n\nKeto has truly changed my life! I also lost around 80 pounds in 5 months. (I was, and still am, morbidly obese).",

In the 2 years since I started, I haven't had a bad breakout. Small patches here and there but nothing that an anti itch cream would fix. \n\nI also have rhinitis since childhood and even got allergy shots when I was a kid because it was really bad. But it didn't really help and I just learned to live with it. I was so used to waking up with a stuffy itchy nose and having sneezing fits. But since keto, it really mellowed down. It's such a relief to wake up breathing normally and not deal with a swollen face almost daily. I still get triggered sometimes but it's no longer a daily battle.",

Decided to do Keto for 3 months in 2021 before an international vacation with the only goal to lose 15 - 20lbs. Weight lost goal was met, but shockingly my plantar fasciitis pain also disappeared. I was pleasantly surprised and became a keto believer.",

I weighted and tracked all my food/macro on the MyFitnessPal app.  \n\nDay 1 is standard Keto - I kept my macro close to 10% Carbs, 20% Protein and 70% Fat.  Typically around 27 grams of carbs for 1500 calories a day.\n\nDay 2 is High Protein - I kept my macro close to 10% Carbs, 35% Protein, and 55% Fat. Typically around 35 grams of carbs for 1500 calories a day.\n\nDay 3 is intermittent fasting (8/16) - I kept my macro close to 10% Carbs, 45% Protein, and 45% Fat. Typically 18g grams. Around 700 calories on this day. For some reason I wasn't very hungry.\n\nBasically rinsed and repeated this for 3 months. I also forgot to mentioned that my wrists pains from being on the computer at work all day also disappeared. \n\nI'm currently doing Keto again and I'm on my 4th month this time. This time around I'm not weighting my food, not tracking macros and doing IF. I'm keeping it simple and pretty much trying to eat less than 20 grams of carbs a day. The only difference that I'm seeing is that without IF I'm not experiencing the wonderful lack of brain fog.\n\nHope this helped!",

I had chronic inflammation and had been on multiple rounds of steroids post surgery (February). I'm shocked by how much it helped. It has not fixed the pain and inflammation 100%, but I would say an 80% improvement. Most notably I can very much tell the difference if I go off diet at all (wine, or more than 30g of carbs a day). Sucks for me because I really enjoy carbs but it's hard to deny that it's working. This also lead to my realizing that the chronic disc issues might actually be caused by the inflammation itself. Anyway I'm on this for at least 3 months but it may need to be longer if it's really working this well.",

The same sort of thing you get with a bad cold or hay fever, except it never went away for me. It would be remedied by taking sudofed nasal spray 4 times daily. This medicine works by reducing the swollen blood vessels in your sinuses. I used it everyday for around a year (even though the bottle says not to do more than 7 days). After starting keto the symptoms completely disappeared. I hit my goal weight a few weeks back, so have the odd dabble with carby junk. And when I do, GUARANTEED, next day my nose is blocked.",

I still have knee arthritis, but I can run up and down stairs and have no pain.  I did lose 50 lbs in a little less than five months so I'm sure that helped, but the pain relief happened first.",

I also had a knee and hip that would ache almost like I had arthritis. Day 2-4 were the worst with adjusting to the diet. Migraine, feeling tired, cravings flu symptoms etc. The thing that stuck around longest was the brain fog I woke up in an absolute daze for about a week and a half. By week two I lost 5 pounds, by week 3 I lost 8. We are at week 4 and now I am practically bursting with energy, my stomach is completely flat, and my bad knee and hip have stopped aching. \n\nTo me it seemed like it happened very quickly. I don\u2019t know if this is normal or if it\u2019s because I\u2019m still in my 20s but my point is if you stick to it your inflammation will go away eventually! \n\nAlso, if you are a person that bloats really badly after eating I would suggest putting a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water and drinking it before eating. It made a world of difference even when I wasn\u2019t on the keto diet.",

I level out after that and consider myself fully adapted by the six week mark.  I tend to mark this when I realise I can exercise without ever really running out of fuel.\n\nBrain fog and mental clarity I find come around quickly and are more noticeable at the front end.  It happens for me within a few days and is hard to ignore.  As time goes on it becomes the new normal.\n\nWhen it comes to pain, in my case this was inflammation and general soreness.  It fades by degree and is very individual depending on what's hurting and why.  I'd say that by three weeks in, I'm in a place where 90% of inflammatory soreness has gone away.\n\nEvery one of these changes is big when it happens.  I have noticed the mental clarity improvements with a simple CICO diet before, but the inflammation and energy levels are pretty unique to keto, the mechanisms for this are well understood.",

    "postText": "Just wanted to say how awesome Keto is for us who are fortunate enough to be able to eat a lot of calories!\n\nIn my pre-Keto days, I ate a healthy diet for the first 2000 calories or so, but then got hungry and grabbed whatever was around - cookies, high sugar granola bars, chips, etc.\n\nNow, Keto keeps me honest. Instead of grabbing an Oreo, I grab some cheese. Instead of chips, I'm grabbing nuts.\n\nYes, I could've done this before, but I didn't have to, so I didn't. Now that I'm Keto and tracking carbs, I'm very conscious of what I'm eating and I pick healthy, nutrient dense, high calorie foods.\n\nMan, I love this diet. Keto for life \u2764\ufe0f (edit: 19 months so far!!)",

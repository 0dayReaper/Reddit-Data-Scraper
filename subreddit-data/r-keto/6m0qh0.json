    "postText": "Today is my 6 month keto anniversary ... and I did it. I lost 100 lbs in 6 months.  Yikes!  \n\nI've tried every diet under the sun.  Weight Watchers, Seattle Sutton, Nutrisystem, juicing, Slimfast, Adipex ... and I just got fatter.  I was thisclose in January to getting bariatric surgery - an obesity specialist told me (very nicely btw) that my only hope of losing weight was to have a gastric sleeve or gastric bypass.  I decided to give losing weight one last go, fell into keto and learned SO MUCH from people here on this sub.  I still have a ways to go ... BUT HOLY MACARONI I'VE LOST 100 LBS IN 6 MONTHS.  (And I ain't no spring chicken either - I'm 47.   If I can do this - with zero exercise mind you - it is entirely possible for anyone to be successful with keto.)\n\nSo literally, yay me!  I have never been so proud of myself in my whole life.  :)\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BWSROvhhp2V/?taken-by=eatbaconloseweight\n\n",

And I bet you won't wake up starving on a keto diet. I used to wake up and get out of bed earlier than I needed to because I'd be laying there thinking about what I was going to eat for breakfast and I couldn't wait any longer. Now, I do intermittent fasting. I wake up at 7:30 on weekdays and typically don't eat until at least 1:00.\n\nBelieve me, you're not the only one who had a diet centered around carbs. But after a few tough days, and a hard week or two, the cravings diminish and it gets surprisingly easy! ",

It takes a few months and then you'll crave your new diet.  Try it and see for yourself.  You will be happy with your weight loss, you'll get compliments, and *you are going to feel good.

You have to bear with me because the first one sounds insane, but I promise it's tasty. \n\n1) Pork Rinds. Break them into bite-size pieces, sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar substitute and add low-carb milk. I use Swerve for the sugar and Ripple (pea milk - 0 carbs) for the milk. As long as you use plain pork rinds, it's pretty dang good.\n\n2) [Raspberry chia pudding](https://ketodietapp.com/Blog/post/2016/08/30/keto-raspberry-chia-pudding). Very similar to overnight oats. I changed the milk from coconut to Ripple to lower the carbs and added 1 Tbsp of raw hemp seeds for protein. When it came time to eat it, I added two chopped up strawberries, 2 Tbsp of heavy whipping cream and a few drops of Ez-Sweetz (liquid sucralose). SO GOOD. \n\nAnd finally, there are all of [these cereal alternatives](http://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/2015/02/25-delicious-low-carb-grain-free-cereal-recipes.html) and [this one](http://mariamindbodyhealth.com/reeses-peanut-butter-cereal/) looks especially good.

But seriously, stay away from bread and pasta and you will see the weight fall off. Counting calories is also a necessity and the easiest way to lose weight.

It is hard work and determination, but the happiness and healthiness you feel afterword is awesome!\n\nEdit: Changed wording thanks to the condescending replies of u/ChionisOfSparta",

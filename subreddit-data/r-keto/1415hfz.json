But if it\u2019s just chicken breast deli meat you\u2019re looking for then the regular one is definitely ok. Occasionally if the deli isn\u2019t too busy I ask them if they can show me the nutrition label for whatever meat I want. There\u2019s usually an unopened one close at hand so they hold it up to the glass so I can take a look. Or obviously buy the meat that\u2019s pre-sliced in packages, I\u2019m just talking about when you get the meat sliced at the deli counter..",

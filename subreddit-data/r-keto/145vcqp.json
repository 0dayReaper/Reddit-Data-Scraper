    "postText": "So I've got a problem, all my ingredients are new except this very very fine psyllium husk powder I bought 11 years ago which IS NOT damaged in any way.\n\nThe issue I have is twice now I've tried to bake this coconut bread recipe and each time the dough just refuses to rise! I thought yeast could be bad but replaced it, tested it, nothing is wrong.\n\nThe ONLY odd thing out is this old psyllium husk which I thought couldn't really expire given its a inert powder; but I'm no expert, so could the 11yo psyllium husk powder be the culprit?",

Yes instant yeast is ok and just fine.\n\nThese just sit in the oven during the hour proofing at 100'C with wet pan underneath, and nothing, not even a slight rise. It's been 3 tries now and I'm sick of wasting ingredients, moving on.  \n\n\nEDIT: It seems possible that the original recipe is actually using psyllium husk MEAL and not super dense powder. So using 2tsp of P-Husk Pwdr instead of 2tablespoons might solve the problem.  Plus 2min or more of kneading.  Might try again some day.",

    "postText": "So, to start, I have always been a voracious meat eater. There is no amount of meat that satisfies. So, since starting keto, I've been in literal hogs heaven. Then out of nowhere in the last few days I have suddenly found myself revolted by the smell, taste and idea of eating meat.\nNeedless to say this has never happened before. At the moment I have about 170lbs of lean body mass and have been going for about 200-225g of protein per day as I do a lot of heavy weight lifting. It hasn't been a problem until now.\nA couple of factors that are new in the last few days:\n* I have been exercising and engaging in exhausting activity FAR more than usual this week (5 days straight with at least 4 hours of physical exertion)\n*my water intake, while excellent overall, is often stymied by availability issues (being far from water sources and running out of what I brought.)\n\nHas anyone else experienced this weird loss of meat appetite? Is this something to be concerned about, especially if I'm trying to build muscle?\nI would have asked r/ketogains but this feels more dietary than bodybuilding focused.",

Typically I will switch out proteins, moving from meat to fish/shellfish  (I have to eat shrimp for a *long* time before I get tired of it) for a time.

My 2 patients today are spending their final decade or so frequently visiting a variety of doctors and bouncing in and out of hospitals, pissing away a hell of a lot of their savings on medical bills.\nI doubt they could afford to pay for their own funerals let alone leave any money to their offspring. Staying alive is expensive, especially when you're old and unhealthy. \n\nI'm not *your* doctor, so I can't issue an ultimatum, but for the love of God, man, do **something**.\n\nMaybe check out /r/electronic_cigarette",

He said that it pissed him off so much that he devoted his life to proving me wrong and a year later he came back to thank me for the motivation. \n\nIt's odd because there are different roles you can take to interact with people. The majority here on this subreddit want to just pat each other on the back and say \"good job\", but not everyone is motivated in that fashion. Some people have to be scared or pissed off to really get an inspiration. So sometimes it's OK to be a jerk to people.",

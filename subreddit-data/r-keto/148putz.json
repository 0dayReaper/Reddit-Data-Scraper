Most of the studies are done on mice or other animals so I don\u2019t really trust it. \n\nAlthough I always like to dig deeper into the topic so I can understand how certain ingredients impact our bodies and health. \n\nDo you know any research papers/ studies about sucralose potential side effects or safety that are done on humans? Please spread the knowledge in the comments below \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4d",

Also, that so much Sucralose was used that it was basically the equivalent of something like 5,000 packets per cup of coffee (it might have been 50,000? Either way - completely over the top).\n\nI'll try to find the article and will edit this post with the link.\n\nThis isn't the one I read, but states basically the same thing:\n\n[Sucralose isn't giving you Cancer](https://gidmk.medium.com/splenda-sucralose-isnt-giving-you-cancer-8ade5ad7a708)\n\n*\"They estimated that sucralose is metabolized into sucralose-6-acetate at up to 10% of weight, which means that you\u2019d actually need at least 50,000 cans of soda to get to the levels of sucralose-6-acetate where there was just barely detectable damage to human cells.\"*",

Many are published in no name journals and literally only get attention because certain groups such as vegans will use any article they get their hands on to push the appeal to nature falicy to push their agenda. Some do it for keto as well, but I'd say in general this sub at least has a better track record than most vegan forums. \n\nIn reality some things are toxic, some are not. But whether they are natural or artificial doesn't really matter most of the time. Lots of Natural things are toxic. Arsenic is natural and technically so are many of the carcinogenic chemicals we know today since they are part of naturally produced oil and gas. Many chemicals such as benzene are naturally occurring. Chemical does not necessarily mean artificial. Most artificial sweeteners are derived from natural ingredients btw. \n\nI have yet to see an in-situ study showing harm from artificial sweeteners. I have no issues or concerns with artificial sweeteners and after seeing first hand the damage that the excess calories and carbohydrates in sugars can do I'd much rather have artificial sweeners time to time. In reality we should probably all just drink more water.",

And if it\u2019s the carbs causing the issue why does it really matter if it came from something like that vs rice or bread. Also idk why the people who demonize carbs immediately go to the extreme and just act like suddenly all carbs consumed are Twinkie\u2019s",

The theory is that based on genetics people can only put so much fat into their fat cells, aka like a bathtub of a certain size you can fill up with a certain amount, and when you go over that amount it spills over and the body starts putting fat in places it shouldn\u2019t like in your muscles and organs. So some people based on genetics have the capacity to add tons of fat and not have a ton of spillover and still have reasonably healthy organs, whereas some people and especially in Asian populations, their bathtub is significantly smaller and they need to stay significantly leaner to stay healthy. \n\nAll that to say yes it sucks they can get T2D with a lower weight but they still had to surpass a threshold and be more overweight than their genetics allowed, aka ate too much and gained too much. So yes they are still overweight, maybe not by our definition but overweight past what their genetics allowed them. The treatment for these people is still trying to get them to a lower bodyfat. So yeah they could have still gotten T2D by overconsuming calories from fat same as carbs, it was simply adding too much fat that caused it.",

Certainly a lot of people testify to this  both within and without the keto communities.\n\nIn all things the poison is in the dose.  I consume sweetener very sparingly and I can report no health issues outside of Malitol and Sorbitol causing bad diahhorea.  As a consequence I avoid those entirely.\n\nAs a safety measure I have taken the decision to not consume any sweeteners on a larger scale, pretty much my only use of a sweetener is a hazelnut syrup in coffee once a day.  There's a lot of keto dessert recipes that call for a cup of more of this stuff.  I refuse to eat that volume.",

This would be how you test if sweetener is affecting you. \n\nYou taste a sweetener. If it's a non-nutritive sweetener (ie not a sugar alcohol) your glucose is not rising because it contains no glucose. However the taste or smell of the food may elicit an insulin spike known as cephalic phase insulin release (CPIR). This release of insulin would in turn signal your cells to absorb some glucose from your blood. Hence why if you blood glucose test after eating the sweetener, you may find that your glucose level has dropped slightly indicating the insulin spike.",

One thing I love about it now that my desire for sweetness is gone but some recipes still require it, is that its not as sweet as other sweeteners or sugar. Its pricey but I halve the amt recipes call for and its perfect. Only mildly sweet, not enough to gross my new tastes out.",

Once there, it\u2019s not broken down, instead it\u2019s removed by the kidneys, and you pee it out.  Sugar alcohols aren\u2019t absorbed into the bloodstream and pass through in the feces.  This is why sugar alcohols are much more likely to cause stomach upset than allulose.",

It has an aftertaste, but after 10+ years I dont notice it anymore.  \n\n\nI cant handle the taste of stevia, even mixed with other sweeteners. Literally, I tried 5 different ones and if i taste in something i cant eat it. But then its good for a diet - if you know what i mean... ;D   \nIts proven with studied \\[not that great studies though\\] that sucralose consumed with carbs are causing insulin resistance in a really short timeframe - just in 2 weeks!   \nIn keto its fine, and you need very little of it, so it unlikely to cause any digestive issues.

It's possible that the \"sweet taste\" alone may signal the pancreas to increase insulin somewhat and elevated insulin is always bad news; in my experience artificial sweeteners absolutely do create hunger pangs (a sign of increased insulin) and many have a negative effect on my gut, so I generally try to avoid them.",

ASPARTAME, is the one that provides a correlation to negative health side effects. And as someone who has lived as an athlete for roughly 2 decades, and consumed all of this stuff, if you listen to your body, you can feel it. Certain scientific studies show this aswell, but that industry also said ASPARTAME was fine to ingest. The only real, typical problem, with the artifical sweetners I mentioned as fine to consume is the pre trained brain. Your brain will quantify this as you eat it, as a sweet(sugar based) food. Sense it's not, over time, people may increase the things they consider as OK, or consequence free. Which if they relapse to any degree they may eat more, or with a focus on the sugary taste that satisfies their brain/addiction and now contributes to a negative result as bad or even worse than they had in the beginning of using these products.

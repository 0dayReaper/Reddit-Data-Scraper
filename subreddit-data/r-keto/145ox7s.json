    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI took a 3 year break from keto but now I want to get back on the wagon. I (F41) am currently sitting at 76kg (171cm) after giving birth 6 months ago and would ideally like to get back to around 60kg. \n\nI struggled with my potassium intake in the past on keto. Any tips for making sure I'm getting enough potassium, magnesium, etc?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

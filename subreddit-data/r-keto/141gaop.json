I'd be happy to do it and happy with the results.\n\nThe fact that it consistently does it while turning me around both physically and psychologically is why I evangelise it to other people.\n\nI hate being fat, I feel terrible, I'm clearly sick and getting sicker.  As I get older the deleterious effects of being fat hit harder.  It's not just about looking better.  It's about a return to health, a return to normality and a return to being in charge of yourself.\n\nA vast food and pharma industry has a great interest in making you sick and dependent.  Fixing yourself and getting them out of your life is truly rewarding.",

This is a huge deal as I am a recovering binge eater. \n\nMy chronic insomnia and acid reflux are totally gone. \n\nI regulated my blood pressure and I've greatly improved and perfected my cholesterol and triglyceride numbers since they were through the roof pre-keto. \n\nMy menstrual cycle has normalized (it is lighter, less painful, and predictable to the day for the first time in my life). \n\nMy anxiety has lessened considerably and I am now able to maintain my calm/cool/collected was in situations that previously would\u2019ve sent me spiraling. \n\nMy libido is always off the charts now, which is amazing. \n\nI've seen serious improvement in my overall dental health (my dentist is very pleased!).\n\nI've gotten rid of the constant brain fog I was unaware existed...mental clarity is a gift I will never take for granted again. \n\nI found a renewed happiness with my life, and self-confidence I never thought I'd get back. I've let go of a serious food/sugar addiction I didn't even realize I had; food was controlling my life and I've taken that control back. It's *liberating* to not be a slave to the cravings and I am never going to stop eating this way for that reason. \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb",

Now I can do approx 50.\n\nI didn't find it hard ... once I lost 10 pounds in the first week, I just tried to ensure that I stayed on keto. My meals were bigger than everyone else's and I was losing 1-2 pounds of bodyfat per week.\n\n**Some success tips:**\n\n1) Download MyFitnessPal and set your keto macros. If you don't know what that means, DM me. Ensure that every snack, meal, and food has the proper macro. If it fits, you'll stay in the \"fat-burning-zone\" (ketosis). **Pretty easy.**\n\n2) drink lots of water\n\n3) make it simple: avoid: bread, rice, pasta, potatoes &amp; sugar. There's some more stuff, but those are the \"big 5\". 6 = bananas.\n\n4) take some before picture. I had zero before pictures...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoodluck",

For me, eating a traditional high carb diet, I was always hungry. I snacked unconsciously. I ate to relieve stress, to provide comfort, to alleviate boredom, you name it. I did not have the understanding and knowledge of food and what my body needed to function well. \n\nWhen I went to keto to lose some weight I was astonished at the process and really enjoyed the cause/effect relationship between what I ate and how I felt. That pushed me to read and learn and pay attention, and I found what works for me. Now\u2026 two and a half years in, I have a different relationship with food and feel great, sleep great, and weigh what I want to weigh. Medically I am much healthier and cognitively I just feel more in control of my life. Carbs and processed foods were NOT good for me at all\u2026 they caused so many issues that simply went away when I was able to remove/minimize them from my diet. I was absolutely unaware of that prior to keto/low carb and surely would have just continued to eat them and suffer the consequences had I not made the change. \n\n\u201cSelf control\u201d is a myth if you don\u2019t understand what you are controlling. So knowledge and a basic understanding of the cause/effect relationship of food is the biggest benefit of keto/low carb for me.",

            "comment": "The biggest change I've seen is no more leg and foot pain.  It used to be so bad at times.  I thought I had plantar fasciitis before I discovered I have a bone spur on my heel, which still hurts if I bump it but only then.  I can go up and down stairs normally and squat down or kneel without pain now.  Who knew carbs were so inflammatory?\n\nThe second biggest change is getting to experience better sleep and no more sleep apnea.\n\nI had hoped my blood pressure was going to go down but no such luck.  I'm a little depressed that I'm going to have to take medication forever and still have high blood pressure.  I imagine my demise will come from a stroke or heart attack before I'm 70.  :-(",

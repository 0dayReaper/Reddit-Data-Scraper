    "postText": "Into 30 days of keto and have mostly have no trouble in falling asleep but if I exercise in the evening then I can be a little restless when going to bed.  The main issue is waking up on 4-7 times throughout the night (normally an hour apart) which is leaving me exhausted in the afternoons into the evenings.  I have good sleep hygiene and consume a single cup of black coffee every morning plus I lift weights and run /walk.  \n\n\nBlood ketones are 0.2 in morning and 0.6 before bed.   \n\n\nDoes anyone have any simple tips that really work from personal experience? I.e. all your daily carbs /bit of fruit before bed? MCT oil? how much magnesium before bed?, trytophan? etc",

Amber (reddish) or reduced lighting helps a little too. Device use may need to be reduced or you can use blue blocking glasses, amber lighting, device night light, etc. This blue light problem may have increased during the pandemic. We were all on the internet for longer hours. You may also need black-out curtains or some kind of window covering.\n2. Fat lowers cortisol. Having butter can help your adrenals in the evenings. Fat is the key to making the hormones work for you. No seed oils.\n3. Develop a night routine on how to get back to sleep, if needed. It would have to be something that's a little boring. I've read that some nurses use the noise of a box fan to get to sleep at various hours. You could count sheep\\*, meditate, use a special sound, wait patiently (no thinking, do counting), etc.\n\nEdit:\n\n4. Use the bathroom. The bladder may be nearly full. Return to bed.",

As a woman of a certain age who has dealt with my body's period of wonky temperature control, I can tell you that back then I slept much better in the winter, despite my personal temperature control issues.  Even now, well past that, I prefer to sleep in as cool a room as I can manage.  Try keeping your room cooler?  And a fan directed at you will both keep you cooler and mask any sounds that might stir you.",

            "comment": "One year ago (as of yesterday) I started my Keto diet.  Since then I have gone from 415 to 244 as of this morning.  My favorite part about these post is always the [comparison pics]( http://imgur.com/a/MIIby) so I put together as many as I could.  \n\n\nMy routine is basic keto with a good bit of intermittent fasting.  I have been doing 5x5 Lifts on and off and I have an exercise bike that I ride while watching Stargate SG-1.\n\n\nIf you like stats you can look at my [Exercise Log]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1de8TJWq_Rry-QtkNnBKzEUmqnXGgAs9p_L9TRU3pFIE/edit?usp=sharing). (Walking/Hiking not included)\n\n\nHere is my [Google Drive Weigh In History]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RqMBU0i_fGJ82UIx5txl095-FumDnhyQRQUNp2iPLYE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAs you can see I hit a rough patch starting in November.  After traveling for work pretty much all of October and getting hit pretty hard by what I can assume was the winter blues (SAD) I started to have issues keeping my calories down.  I finally cracked over Christmas and had a carb binge, before that binge I still managed my carb intake.  It doesn\u2019t show it in the chart but I actually got up to 268 after that binge.  Once January came around I finally started feeling like my old self and began to turn things back around.  This little binge really showed me that I really was/am addicted to food and it is really easy to fall back into that hole.\n\n\nHere is my [FIRST POST]( https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/3hugwo/pics_200_days_of_keto_141_pounds/) if anyone wants to see my lipid panel results.  My next physical is at the end of the month so I will be able to see what a year keto has done.\n\n\n\nThanks for taking a look.\n\n",

Your progress is amazing and I wanted to tell you look great!\n\nI've read many, many posts. All the FAQs, and stickied posts...yet I still find myself lost a bit about the food intake. I don't have a grill, nor can I get one right now so the meat I do cook, I cook in a iron skillet or pan. I hardly know anything about meat cuts and what's okay to eat or not.\n\n It just all seems intimidating. For example, suddenly with keto fat is okay. But there are good fats and bad fats right? What foods translate to eating fat? I read a thread in here where someone mentioned eating pepperoni which threw me for a loop because I was under the impression that eating proceesed meat is no bueno. Maybe I need a ELI5 for Keto. I've read many posts but a lot tend to contradict each other. Also I just learned that some vegetables are off limits\n :( and fruit?! :((((  \n\nAnyway regardless of my million questions...your post still gives me hope to get back my  130lb self.\n\n\nEdit: my spelling errors",

When I take those probiotics I pretty much don't get hungry at all, it's a weird feeling. I've tried other ones that were specifically labelled for travelling, but all they did was block me up, so I like the primal ones. Hope that helps!",

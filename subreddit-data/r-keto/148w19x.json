Could this be from not getting enough sodium and possibly getting dehydrated? Aside from that I feel amazing",

            "comment": "Not an uncommon feeling/observation. Yes, stay hydrated. At the very least with water, but if you're peeing a lot (and you probably are), definitely make sure your sodium intake is high enough...add some to a bottle of water. Any electrolyte boost is good when you're peeing a lot. There are both premade and homemade options for water additives to enhance both electrolytes and flavor.",

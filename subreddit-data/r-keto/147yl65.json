    "postText": "Hey guys, I was keto for 8 days until I ended up eating carbs last night. I was having some fairly severe symptoms which were mostly unrelated to keto, but I was ALSO starting to get keto flu despite supplementing electrolytes. I hadn't felt nauseous until that day, either. Anyway, I ended up needing to go to hospital for something, but I just had carbs in order to make things easier. I kind of regret it now and the other medical situation has kind of been dealt with, more or less, but now I am back to keto. I don't know whether to expect to \"start from scratch\" per se. I wonder also why it takes me (this time and the time I was keto last year) a week to develop nausea. I am supplementing with 2g Na, 1g K and 400mg Mg, along with food sources (beef, avocado, goat's cheese etc). Perhaps this isn't enough, but I am always so paranoid of adding more potassium! How do you all just guess without testing?   \nAnyway, not sure what the point of this post quite is, other than to share that I am trying not to give up and get back on the bandwagon. I had doubts because I wasn't sure if it's too much stress on the body to go in and out of ketosis whilst not yet fat adapted. In general, I wonder about keto because of the electrolytes, too. I wonder whether anyone here started off needing to supplement a lot of electrolytes but then managed to decrease use with time? Thanks!",

It's spread throughout the day.\n\nA lot of my sodium comes from lite salt (which is a mix of sodium chloride and potassium chloride). I put a mix of salt and lite salt into a container in the morning, and then I know I need to get through all that by the end of the day. I add it to food, add it to my water bottle, I take a straight pinch of it and wash it down with water. I go by weight, not volume. \n\nOne of the \"risks\" of long term keto is potential kidney issues in people susceptible to that. This can be avoided by getting sufficient electrolytes. My dietitian helped me develop my electrolytes intake.",

I wonder whether some develop kidney issues on keto due to increased oxalate intake - not in all cases, of course.   \nI also sip my ketoaid throughout the day. Perhaps I need to increase the amounts. Was there some trial and error whilst figuring our your optimal amounts of each electrolyte?",

I feel better when I get the right levels. I don't see any reason to short change my body. The muscles in my heart and diaphragm need electrolytes. Since I want them working 24/7, I make sure to give them what they need. There's a rare occasion when I get too much sodium or potassium based on my hydration -- I notice a bit of a pounding in my ears and flushed cheeks when that happens. But in those cases it's temporary and it's less about too much electrolytes and more about too little water intake. My pee color helps diagnose it as well.\n\nThis is just my experience.\n\nI do some long events that push my hydration and electrolytes. I struggle with those events if my levels aren't balanced. It's all the trial and error I need.",

For those requesting more Django, here he is!  http://imgur.com/i21642W  He's not overweight at all, so the accusations of abuse and overfeeding are unwarranted. ",

I stopped training for a 60-mile 3-day walk, because my fat measurements just held month after month. So, for me, I purposely have had to avoid exercise and only do diet. I do walk more than when I was bigger, because it's easier, but I no longer go out for the purpose of walking or do any other purposeful exercise. YMMV, and I'm sure you'll find other folks who do fine with exercise.\n\nI'm waiting until I've lost the bulk of the weight (and with it, much of the fat) before I resume working out. I've still got about 50-60 pounds to go and a number of percentage points in the fat department (I only check fat about every other month, so I don't have a good number on that ATM).",

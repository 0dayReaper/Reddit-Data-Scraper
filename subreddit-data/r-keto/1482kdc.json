    "postText": "I just had smoked oysters and laughing cow (light) cheese as a snack and I\u2019m about to freeze dry some dill pickle chips. I\u2019m interested in what other keto lifestyle people snack on or maybe even meals that might differ from the usual meat, eggs and cauliflower. I also enjoy Quest chips, cheese, nuts and pork rinds but what are your favorite out of the ordinary foods?",

In terms of Omega fats and least amount of mercury.",

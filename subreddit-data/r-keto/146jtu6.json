    "postText": "Hi Fellas. I do the keto diet for mental health issues, ADHD, Depression, anxiety, and a little bit of OCD, I guess. I know it works. It makes me more clear headed and less brain fog, and I gained a sense of control, but I recently saw another video from Dr Chris Palmer, and its the first time that the ratios come into my mind. I get 20 Carbs maximum on my diet, but I get probably on average the same amount of protein and fats, like 140 g each. I dont want to lose weight. I just want to feel better.   \nAm I missing from some benefits for not going lower on protein. Any knowledge, experience, anecdote? I want the most out of the diet, but in a person who doesnt wanna lose wight, Ratios of 1:3, and specially 1:4, seems like ton shit of fats, and its like, I dont even know what to eat to get to those ratios, but I want the MOST from the mental health benefits, because Ive seen it work, and you know, im tired of feeling shitty ",

I prioritise high quality saturated fats, add loads of tallow and butter into everything I cook.  I stopped measuring my proteins because I realise with high quality fats, will always come with high quality protein.  I am still able to gain lean muscle mass this way.  Thinking back to a decade of meticulously counting macros and always stressing over these numbers everyday was all unnecessary stress.\n\nMy wife and I eats this way, she consistently weighs the same whereas I can easily adjust to either maintain or bulk by slightly force feeding myself once my taste signal kicks in and turn that juicy steak into something torturous to chew on.\n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD, manic bipolar, depression, anxiety, OCD, lots of obsessions and ticks.  They come in a big basket.  Now it\u2019s as if they never existed.",

Now I just prioritize fatty meat, and add fats to anything lean. \n\nI'm sure everyone is a little different in this respect. Just play around with the ratios until you find something that works. Spend a week doing high fat, like 80%. Another at 70%, etc.",

    "postText": "Hi!  \nFirst post, second day back on Keto\nBack story, I did keto in 2018 with great success. \nThen life hit me... Dad died in 2019, pandemic and overall sadness that set in for a LONG time.  \nGained a good amount of weight.\nI finally feel whole again, and I've been going to the gym regularly for 5 months, but the scale is not moving. \nI eat healthy, but am over 40 and things just don't work the way they used to... ugh\nThe major issue I'm facing besides weight is foot pain. It comes and goes, I'm pretty sure it is Plantar F..? I can't spell it sorry.\nIt hasn't stopped the work outs but the foot pain has been going on 6 month plus, and like I said comes and goes (I am waiting to see a doctor...) \nUntil then I am really hopeful keto might help...\nAnyone deal with any pain in joints that went away?\nAnd how long would you estimate?\nTIA",

    "postText": "Pickle de Gallo! Pickle salsa. It's so good! You can make it yourself but I got the Grillo's brand at Costco.\nI've been searching for something to replace the barbeque sauce I used to have with brisket before I started keto. I tried a sugar free barbecue sauce but it was too sweet for my tastes. I put the pickle de gallo on brisket and it really satisfied that tangy sauce craving. I also had it with pollo asado and it was perfect. I got the one labeled \"hot\" but I would say it's mild. I am super psyched to have found it, especially because it has only a few ingredients: Cucumbers, Brine (Water, Distilled White Vinegar, Salt), Yellow Onion, Red Bell Pepper, Jalape\u00f1o Peppers, Garlic, Habanero Peppers. Getting some good health benefits at the same time from the veggies so I highly recommend!",

If the meat is smoked, the smoke should further enhance the flavor.        \n    \nOf course, some folks  add bbq sauce to their chopped beef, but at that point it's just brisket soup    \ud83d\ude02",

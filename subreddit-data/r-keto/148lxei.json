    "postText": "This is my second time doing keto with great results but this time I dove in with adding daily workouts - 6 days a week.  As of this morning I\u2019m down 46lbs (39M at 6\u20195.  SW:431 CW: 385 GW: 250) since April 17th and have no plans to stop.  I\u2019m pretty solid on macros and diet (1875 calories, 145g protein, 20g carbs and 135g or less of fat - pretty much direct from the calculator and I adjust as I lose).  It\u2019s been fine and I can definitely see a difference in my body and muscles but feel my energy is getting lower.  I go first thing in the morning due to my schedule, do half an hour of cardio and then 30-45 minutes of weights.  I would just like more energy!  Anyone find a good keto approved pre-workout?  I\u2019ve been having a rockstar pure zero on my way and it helps but more would be better.  I hate the jittery caffeine feeling but obviously the rockstar is high in caffeine and honestly I barely feel it.  Any recommendations??  I\u2019m checking out ketogains as well but my main goal is big time weight loss to finally end my obesity.  With more muscle comes more weight loss but getting big is hardly my goal.  Thank you in advance!",

One thing I found, in addition to \"less cravings\" was this time I seem to just have endless \"clean energy\".\n\nI would honestly ignore the temptation to do any kind of \"pre workout\" loading - the key thing you're trying to stimulate is \"more ATP production from ketones\" and in theory that will happen with continued adjustment from your mitochondria.\n\nWould be interested to hear if you find it's getting easier without intervention in a month.",

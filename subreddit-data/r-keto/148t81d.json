    "postText": "Hey guys! New to keto and going to be coming here a lot for questions! \nEverything I read is a little different, I guess based on someone\u2019s goals. I\u2019m looking to lose weight. I\u2019m 26f 5\u20199 and 185lbs. I\u2019m hovering around 1300calories/day. I\u2019m able to keep my carbs under 50g/day. I\u2019m struggling on what my protein and fats should be so I can lose weight. Thank you for being such a great community!",

If you feel like your calories are too low also take a generic multivitamin to help supplement nutritional needs.",

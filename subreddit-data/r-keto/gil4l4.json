    "postText": "\nStarted on: 14 November 2017\n\nFemale. 40 years old. \n\nHeight: 169cm\n\nSW: 165kg\n\nGW: 60kg\n\nCW: 58kg\n\nReached goal weight on: 7 April 2020\n\nI lost the weight with keto, intermittent fasting and weighing/logging all food and liquids into my fitness pal. \n\nFor the first year I did no exercise at all. Then started walking. Now I do a 5km walk 4days a week before work, and a nerd fit body workout twice a week for toning and building muscles. \n\n[Before and after](https://imgur.com/a/FupTx5u) \n\nI had already lost 20kg when I took the left pic. \n\nI am so excited with what I\u2019ve accomplished and now I have a future to look forward too. \n\nI hope my hard work can encourage and inspire others.\n\nEdit: oh my god! My first ever gold. Thank you so much. That means so much to me \ud83d\udc96\n\nEdit2: 5 awards including a gold and platinum!! You guys are going to make me cry at work. The outpouring of support and caring is tremendous and has touched my heart. Like many of us I have low self esteem (and while my fianc\u00e9 does his best to lift me up) this has been an eye opener. After work I plan on reading every single comment and reply to all questions.\n\nEdit3: you guys are amazing! I can\u2019t believe how wonderful everyone is. I had no idea that this would be the response to my post. \n[MFP weight loss progress in a line](https://imgur.com/a/2FGcOdo)",

I have read several times, mostly in the fasting sub, that hunger signals based on routine eating times will go away regardless of whether you eat or not. Just curious if that's your experience.\n\nAnd of course, congratulations on your success. You look great and I bet you feel even better. :)\n\nETA: Have you done anything in particular to prevent loose skin? My starting weight was around 400 lbs and I have terrified myself by watching these YouTube videos where women have skin removal surgeries after losing hundreds of pounds. Your skin looks much much tighter than what I have trained my mind to expect, so I was just wondering if that was a concern for you or if you did anything to combat it.",

I don\u2019t keep lots of snacks at work so if I do eat something it\u2019ll be 3 sugar free lollies. \n\nAs for the loose skin I didn\u2019t do anything at all. I knew that at my age and weight I wouldn\u2019t end up with a perfect flat stomach anyway. The picture doesn\u2019t show how bad my stomach actually is. Quite a bit of overhang. \n\nI am not afraid of surgery and have had a consult with a plastic surgeon for a full circumference tummy tuck. Just waiting on finding out how much it will cost. And I\u2019ll still need work done on my arms, thighs and boobs. \n\nI\u2019ve only recently been able to look in the mirror and see that I\u2019ve changed. While I\u2019ve shrunk my overall shape feels the same. But I recently met a lady that was bigger than my starting weight and boy I could see the difference in the mirror now. \n\nAnd while I find the loose skin annoying if I can\u2019t afford the surgery then I\u2019ll be fine. Because it\u2019s a reminder on how far I\u2019ve come and hopefully a reminder not to stuff up again.",

I WILL say (and I hope this doesn't come off as bragging, because it's more surreal than anything) I do get hit on quite a bit. So much so that I have had to make up a fake husband's name and memorize how long we've been married, etc etc lol. Sometimes even THAT fails to be a deterrent. I also get hit on by younger men a lot... thinking I am around 18-19 or so, which is a very odd experience.",

Not that different, but it's another angle at least! I should have included it as an album but I forgot. \n\nalso, for those that may have noticed, I lost quite a bit in the, you know, the boob area. Don't be afraid that keto did that, ladies! I actually had a reduction surgery because I had size G's and they were literally destroying my spine, so the ol' knockers got knocked down a couple sizes (which look even smaller in this because of a sports bra).",

                    "comment": "Sure! \n\n* During the time I lost the most weight, I honestly could not tell you how many calories I consumed. I adhered to the \"if you are hungry, eat, but eat the right things\" Right now I am at about 1200 calories a day, mostly because that's just really all I need to feel full. \n* 8 months for the whole thing, with the majourity coming off in the first five months or so I suppose?\n* I did just standard keto, no intermittent fasting.\n\nA day of meals, hmm.... I remember when I first started I ate a lot of bacon and eggs and tun fish salads lol, but after a while of having a go at this, I have expanded my palate.\n\nExample:\n\n**Breakfast**\n\nmicrowave \"spanakopita\" I'll just put the recipe here in case anyone wants to try it, because this is my favourite thing to eat in the morning:\n\n* 1 large egg\n* 1 cup raw chopped spinach\n* 1/4 cup sundried tomato &amp; basil whole milk feta cheese\n* 1 Tbs whole milk ricotta\n* 1/2 Tbs Mediterranean Herbs olive oil\n* 1 tsp parsely (or to taste)\n* white ground pepper to taste\n* salt to taste\n* sprinkle with dried chives or fresh slices of green onion\n* (you can also add just a bit of minced garlic and a very small bit of dill if you like, though the flavours can be a bit overwhelming in this size of a dish, I usually skip them.)\n\n1. stir everything together in an 8oz ramekin or cup\n2. microwave on high one minute  \n3. stir it all again\n4. microwave on high one more minute\n5. let set for about another minute or so in the microwave with the door shut, this will allow the egg to finish cooking itself without the risk of overcooking and getting dry/gray eggs\n6. eat dat shiz\n\njust a note, it's a pretty \"moist\" dish, as in you will see moisture from the cheese/spinach/olive oil at that bottom, but the egg will continue to absorb all that as you eat it, feel free to mix it up as you do so as well\n\n\n**Mid-Morning Snack**\n\n24 Blue-Diamond oven roasted almonds with sea salt\n\n\n**Lunch**\n\nTurkey &amp; Pesto Aioli Wrap\n\n* mission low carb small tortilla (3g net carb, I might get hate for this but I have no issue staying in keto on them so I eat them, you can easily just use lettuce leaves instead)\n* 2 slices deli turkey\n* 1 slice ultra thin swiss cheese\n* 1 tbsp pesto &amp; basil aioli \n* spinach leaves\n* red onion slices\n* 1/4 of an avocado, sliced\n* spritz of pure lemon juice\n\nI usually toast the wrap, aioli, cheese and meat in a munsey toaster, then add the colder stuff, it's so delicious\n\n**Afternoon Snack**\n\n1.5-2 oz of various cheeses, I'm a big cheese buff so I am always trying new things. My favourite though is roquefort or a blue veined gorganzola.\nOR (or a mix of both)\nA tin of sardines with olive oil, cavendars and salt. For a buck a tin, can't really go wrong and I get my omega3's\n\n**Dinner**\n\n\"stracciatella\"\n\nI basically make an egg drop soup with whatever I feel like throwing in there. Chicken broth, an egg, spinach, olive oil, onions, chicken, whatever I have on hand. This helps me replenish my sodium as well.\n\nThat's my most common day right now!",

Now that I've lost quite a bit, I completely agree that the loose skin is a completely acceptable tradeoff and is way better than being morbidly obese.\n\n&gt; And as far as the breakup goes, we both had been in our own worlds for almost three years, so it was just sort of inevitable.

After all of the hard work and effort you've put in, you deserve all the happiness in the world. And yes, I know that keto makes it pretty easy to lose weight, but you are still putting forth a lot of effort and discipline to make it happen and to stay on track.\n\nHey, I really appreciate you taking the time to write a detailed response. You seem like an incredibly nice woman. Have a fantastic weekend. :)",

And luckily when I am on keto, that voice yelling at me to EAT THOSE DINNER ROLLS is very much quieted and maintainable. Don't get me wrong, keto requires a lot of discipline, especially up front. And the helpful thing to remember, is keto is not a 0 carb diet, that's impossible. For instance, I have a mission low carb (3g net carb) wrap for lunch sometimes, and I have no issue staying in ketosis; I just make sure my net for the day is under 30g of net carbs. Get some urinalysis strips and keep track of your ketones. This is the best way to sort of gauge how your body reacts to keto, what kicks it out and what doesn't. That's how I'm able to maintain a large number of ketones, and be satisfied with the types of things that I eat.",

I am on keto, in ketosis, and run 6 times a week for an hour, roller derby twice a week, and weights 3-4 times a week but I have hit that plateau and been stuck there for 3 months. I use a tape measure too but nothing has shrunk. No matter how much exercise I do or how little food I eat, I can't seem to lose any more. Any advice?",

My fiancee has lost about 30 lbs in that time span.  \n\nMaybe we need to start exercising more. We go for walks when we can.  Do various weight exercises like push ups, lunges, squats and planks.  Not sure why we aren't losing faster though.  Hopefully by this time next year we will be at our goals.",

If you aren't using something to keep track of your carbs/protein/fats, you neeeeed to. And yes, too much protein can cause an insulin response, which is not in keeping with keto. Fats are definitely your friend. My goal for each day is about 10% carbs 35% protein and 55% fat. Pretty typical macros for the most part.",

Numbers help as far as setting tangible goals to work towards, but there is no reason to feel embarrassed or whatever if you weigh 150 as long as you are happy with how you look and feel.  I say this because I was surprised to see that you're about my height and weight after seeing the pictures.  I thought you for sure had to be 4 or 5 inches taller than me.  Nope.  I am 5'2 or 5'3 and 133 atm and, at least to me, I don't look nearly that tiny!

Anything you have on you looks so much more obvious! I think that's where toning comes into play, you get to mold your body a bit more and accentuate the shapes.

    "postText": "https://imgur.com/a/uqzw9bW\n\nHopefully this works, could not remember how to share a photo.  The inflammation reduction is always startling. Started mid February and have lost close to 50 lbs.  sharing because others\u2019 progress photos have always been one my biggest motivators.\n\nEdited: I have not dyed my hair. In the second photo, it is blow dried, I\u2019m in different lighting and it\u2019s parted different.  I still have the same white hair and am happy to post another photo to show it\u2019s still there. Took this just now. People are weird. I genuinely love my white hair.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/i5R5Njt\n\nThere are a few folks on this thread that say keto changed their grey hair growth.  I\u2019d love to see a conversation on that!",

And I have struggled my whole life with food addiction. I normally eat like a child with no rules. I also have struggled with very persistent \u201cfood chatter\u201d (all day thoughts of food, basically an obsession) and that also disappeared.  This is *keto specific.* I\u2019ve been on any diet you can imagine and none of them have had this effect except keto. I\u2019m not sure of the science behind it so I could not explain it to you but it is a shocking change for me.\n\nI think the key to this happening is to be consistent.  No cheating.",

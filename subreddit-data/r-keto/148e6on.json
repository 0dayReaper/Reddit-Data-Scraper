    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nHas anyone had a similar experience here? I started keto late february and lost about 15lb (Just under 7 kg) but even though i am still doing it i am finding i am already at a plateu. I have A LOT to lose so its not like i ran out fo body fat. I never seem to be in ketosis based on the tests i use either.  I have even been doping intermittent fasting with bullet proof coffee and still i am losing and gaining the same 2 or 3 pounds over and over. I am considering going back to slimming world or calorie conting but i know they do not suit me as much as keto has been. Thanks for any assistance",

Even though I wasn't eating sugar I was enjoy 3000+calories. Most of which was fat and nuts.  \n\nYou should look into what you're eating and make sure you're going about it properly.",

I find it discouraging. Weight can fluctuate for the silliest reasons and it has nothing to do with fat loss. If the scale doesn\u2019t budge for a month or two I\u2019m likely to throw my hands up and go back to my regular eating habits.\n\nAfter watching a coworker lose a ton of weight on keto I decided to give it one last go, but this time I donated my scale to a thrift store and just stuck to my diet.\n\n6 months later, I have no idea how much weight I\u2019ve lost and I don\u2019t care. People comment on my weight loss daily. I feel healthier, more energetic, more focused, and I\u2019m liking what I see in the mirror. That\u2019s enough for me.\n\nI know this approach isn\u2019t for everybody. I know not everyone wants to just trust the process and some people want to make sure what they\u2019re doing is working and that\u2019s all fine by me. Just sharing a personal discovery that helped me so before people come for me I am NOT saying there\u2019s a right or wrong way to approach your weight loss or life.",

Make sure you\u2019re burning body fat by being in a caloric deficit.  If you\u2019re doing keto for weight loss ditch the bulletproof coffee and don\u2019t add extra dietary fats.

We often overeat because it takes about 20 minutes between physical full until your brain registers it, so practice eating until only 80% full, as humans we often underestimate portion sizes, so it\u2019s good to track with a scale so you get better at recognizing what portions actually look like.\n\nAnd the other part that has really helped me to lose weight is just accepting that there will be times where I\u2019m hungry and that\u2019s ok because I\u2019m trying to lose weight.  The body is built for survival, it wants to signal to eat calories when I\u2019m in a deficit and that\u2019s a normal healthy response.\n\nKeto makes it easier because I\u2019m tapping body fat for that daily energy, but the body still likes to consume calories - so intuitive eating only really works well when trying to eat at maintenance- at least for me.",

I basically hit a plateau which indicated to me that I am eating too many calories somewhere in the day and that maybe I\u2019m not fully in ketosis. What I decided to do was straight up skip lunch and eat a quest bar around 3PM and have a protein shake in the late afternoon. This automatically cuts maybe 400 calories in the day. At night I don\u2019t really \u201climit\u201d myself in the sense that I snack like normal (on nuts, cheese, cold cuts, etc) after dinner. I finally broke through a short term goal of mine so I think it\u2019s been working. \n\nSomething to think about. Skipping lunch is easier for me than cutting out snacking at night.",

Skip breakfast or dinner a couple times a week.\n4. Triple check your carb count each day and make sure you're staying under 20g.\n5.

So here's what worked for me.\n\n1) Macro \\\\ cal tracker.  It gives me boundaries and keeps me accountable. I can make better decisions. If I see I have 200 cal left in the day, I can look at macros and make a good decision on what I can eat.\n\n2) Decrease your calories if you can. I would aim for 1800 to start. I do 1600.   \n\n3) Go for a walk or two or three every day. It doesn't have to be far, just do what you can. 5 mins twice a day is a good start.  Don't worry about speed. Increase over time and you feel better and lose weight. I started out not being able to walk for 2 mins without rest.  So I did 2 mins three times a day and slowly worked up. Walk 2 minutes, stand rest for 2 mins, then repeat to help build up.   I can now walk for about 45 without rest. I walk about 90 total with 1-2 breaks now.  Walk outside if you can. Walk somewhere green if you can.  For me, walking is the only thing to chase away my depression.\n\n4) Eat as clean as you can but don't beat yourselves up either.  I mean avoid all the fancy keto products and sweeteners. Eat meats, eggs, cheese, veggies not atkins bars etc.  Your taste buds will change over time.",

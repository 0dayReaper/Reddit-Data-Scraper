            "comment": "I'm using \"macros\". Seems OK. I think I had to add 95% of my foods to the database though. Once you've done that, tracking is very easy.\n\nI've been a little bit lazy though, I just add name, manufacturer, calories, fat, protein and Net carbs. There's slots for sodium and vitamins, fibre etc if you want.\n\nI'd rather type 6 lines that actually represent my brand of food, rather than use generics.\n\nCase in point, whatever app you use check out egg nutrition. Here in the UK, egg nutrition has less than 0.4% carbs... So that's 2 medium eggs and under 0.4g, so LESS than 0.2g per egg.  Every app I've seen with generics likes to put it as 0.4 per egg.  Small stuff like that adds up, makes it harder to plan. \n\nLook up almond flour on whatever app you choose, and then look at your manufacturers nutrition....  Mines pretty different.\n\nI used MFP and chrono. The main reason I went to macros was add placement.... Bottom bar in macros",

Blood ketone and glue testing is way more accurate.  \n\nI'd recommend you get the keto-mojo or similar, see where you are for a couple of days eating g as you have been, then experiment with increasing to 18 or 20 carbs.\n\n20 is the sweet spot for most of us, but I can maintain DEEP, therapeutic ketosis for weeks at a time by eating 20 to 30 carbs within my 1 hour eating window, in combination with a tough 30 - 40 min resistance (with weights) workout at least 3 times a week (workout fasted, right before your meal if possible so those nutrients can go to support muscle stability and growth).  More muscle = more fat loss while in ketosis.\n\nThis shouldn't make you suffer, and it sounds like you are.  I hope you can put some joy back into eating.\n\nI LOVE my one meal a day and land at maybe 14 -16 most days.  Lots of steamed vegetables,  delicious salads, steak, seafood, pork and lots of chicken.  Stir fry, grill, pressure cooking - so many options.",

They show \"excess\" ketones in the early days when the body just splurges out ketones, but if you've been keto for 6 months your body will be well adapted by now and only making ketones as you need them, sort of on-demand. Congratulations on your weight loss, you should be proud of that man, that's a solid effort.",

After 2021, They said he doesn\u2019t even register on the chart for blood sugar problems at all anymore.  \nBut we wanted to be more flexible with our diet and slowly added in a small amount of slow digesting carbs, like beans and other legumes or even a little whole grains, fruit, and dark chocolate . Full disclosure, we eventually gained back 10 lbs each, but his blood sugar is actually perfect, and we have otherwise remained at a healthy weight since then and feel we enjoy a diverse diet with little to no cravings . It feels like truly balanced energy, and the blood tests agree. I suppose we call it a slow-carb, diabetic diet. \nAlso, we drink alcohol. A fair amount of vodka-soda and hard seltzers. That\u2019s probably where the 10lbs came from.\nAlso you look great in that Carhart!",

As for variety you can maybe include some veggies like cucumberor celery (w/cream cheese dip), cabbage (Napa is really low), broccoli, spinach, kale which can be used in stir fry, stews, salad). Zucchini, cauliflower. Pickles and olives can be good choices. Stir fry is one of the easiest ways to use many of the veggies and there are many recipes online. You can also crockpot a cabbage stew (just watch portions and include more meat in the recipe). Almond flour pancakes or chaffles (waffles made with like cheese and egg).  I also make an \"enchilada\" with an egglife wrap, cheese, pork/chicken, and little green sauce/salsa and guacamole and sour cream. I get the Wholly Guacamole brand single serve cups for portion control as I love guac. ..anyway congrats on the great weight loss!",

There is different types of protein, poultry of which my favorite are chicken wings, pork; like pork chops and bacon, seafoodI like tilapia, salmon, shrimp, lamb, I also really like beef liver myself, eggs also have protein, and of course vegetables.\n\nAlso, may I ask why your carbs are so low? Unless you're doing that specific amount for therapeutic reasons there's no need to purposefully go so low on the carbs. With a little more 20 to 25g a day you can add all kinds of veggies to your diet. I mean don't force it, but allow yourself some room for more variety. If you restrict what you eat to only a handful of items willpower alone will only take you so far. You should be enjoying your diet, not suffering through it \n\nAs for feeling sick after your cheat day, that makes a lot of sensr. Your body is not used to those food anymore, I would honestly just avoid them, and if you're enjoying the foods you are eating on your diet you will find no need to cheat. I had a stir fry from a Chinese restaurant some months back, I thought... hey beef and vegetables, but what ever the sauce had (probably sugar) just ruined my stomach for a few days.\n\nGood luck.",

Some people go as high as 50g and are still in ketosis. Just remember that ketosis is a tool to lose weight, but you have to be in a caloric deficit. The truth is ketosis itself isn't what's making you lose weight, but it is helpful for that and other things like swelling and such. The actual reason for weight loss is a caloric deficit, and keto makes that easy for most people. \n\nI'd read the FAQ page here on r/keto, it will give you a lot of that info I'm talking about in more detail.",

A significant amount of your dietary suitability is based on gut microbiome. \n\nThere are countless studies showing people losing just as much weight on a carb-heavy diet but the key thing is...carbs are what their micro-biome is responsive to. \n\nIf Keto is making you miserable, definitely do not do it and don't listen to cultists who tell you otherwise. \n\nI once did a plant-based carb diet and in that 4 weeks I lost 5.2KG of pure fat and added 1.8KG of lean muscle whilst lifting.  Confirmed with DEXA body scans. \n\nYou need to find the lifestyle that works for you.  It's not a diet, it's your life. \n\nTry a 90% plant based with whole grains and see how it works out.  Try high protein. Try OMAD.  Etc",

I'm so tired of pork chops. I was gonna start including cod. Burger sometimes breaks it up. Keto hotdog buns and burger buns from Franz have 1 net carb. Mission has 0 net carb tortillas and making street tacos with enough fir leftovers helps... it's a battle, my dude. I have lost weight, but im not happy, always feeling like I'm suffering and starving. It took us a while to gain it gonna take a while to lose it. I'm not doing keto candy snacks anymore I think they throw me out of ketosis.",

    "postText": "I spent 3 weeks doing low carb before I shifted to full keto, which I've now been doing for two weeks. I'm down 4kg (8.8lbs) but I've been seeing improvement in other areas.\nIt really hit this morning when I opened the fridge to figure out what I wanted for breakfast and I realised I actually wanted cheese! And bacon! I've gone through being sick of these things and come out on the side of actively choosing them! It feels brilliant",

Did a month no problem, only stopped for social reasons. \n\nCouple of breaks later and I constantly have this nagging desire for Costco croissants, oatmeal raisin cookies, and a jersey mikes sub. I give my partner whiplash between \u201cim not breaking keto for my birthday because it\u2019s too hard to get back on\u201d and \u201cim so fucking close to just giving in and dying by 60\u201d.",

This time round the weight loss is proving slower but I'm hoping the benefits will be more long lasting.

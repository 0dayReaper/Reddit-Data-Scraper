    "postText": "Brief background, (M,33, 185cm) been doing keto on and off due to plateaus and came from 122kg to 95kg now. Still a while to go. \n\nBeen working out 3-4 days a week, however when looking in the mirror I noticed that my belly starts to have a hanging downward position. Did anyone have the same experience and how to straighten this out. Do have to admit I\u2019ve not been very active ( almost nothing) on my abs and could do way way more. Goal is ofcourse to have a flat belly with final goal of seeing the abs. Is this a matter of food or workout.",

The coveted 6 pack abs are a combination of extensive abdominal training to plump the relevant muscles and ridiculously low bodyfat percentage as you want the thinnest possible layer of belly fat hiding all of your effort.\n\nAt this body fat level you have to regulate calorie consumption precisely to match your energy &amp; nutrition needs throughout the entire day and night. Obviously, the people who can do this are not only a bit obsessive, they are also rather single-minded &amp; not usually a whole lot of fun to be around.\n\nNote that even the professionals (like bodybuilders) don't make it a year round lifestyle. They train to peak for a certain period or season when they do their tournaments. In their off season they concentrate on adding muscle mass (all over, not just abdominals) &amp; lose a lot of their striation &amp; muscle definition.\n\nAre you sure your goals are realistically achievable &amp; sustainable over the long term?",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! Just started keto on Friday. F24 5'4 SW:188 lbs. I am trying get down to around 130lbs on Keto. I am moderately active and currently consuming 1200 calories a day with sub 20g of carbs and around 85g protein. I am mostly vegetarian and have a hard time hitting protein goals even with protein shakes. I also don't think I am losing weight fast enough. I track carbs using an app and log everything from condiments to seasoning. How much loss should I be seeing and are my macros right?\n\nEdit - I guess I am being a little too paranoid about whether I am doing it correct.",

Keep **TOTAL** carbs sub 20g each day in the beginning.\n\nYou'll have better luck with this approach, especially at the beginning. It's the people who fall in to the \"net carb\" trap after doing this for a while that has people plateauing earlier than they should and it's because of funky food label confusion. To go hard in the beginning, just keep it simple and cut out anything sweet for as long as you can last before reaching for the keto friendly sweet treats. I did chicken thighs, asparagus or broccoli, black coffee and water with intermittent fasting in the beginning 2 weeks. Gave my tongue time to reappreciate sweetness.",

You don\u2019t want to lose weight fast either because when it\u2019s fast, it\u2019s not sustainable. The pounds and fat WILL shed off. You just gotta take it one day at a time. Make sure you\u2019re eating right and get your electrolytes in. There\u2019s hidden sugars in everything, so be extra careful.",

            "comment": "Keto weight loss is funky: sometimes you\u2019ll see your waist lose an inch and your weight stays the same, as fat is converted to the same weight of muscle.  *The scale is not the boss of you!*. Rather, it\u2019s how you feel and how your clothes fit.  I also measure my fat pads: my belly fat used to be 12\u201d high and 1\u201d thick, and now it\u2019s half that in both dimensions and I can see muscles under it now that I could not see before keto.\n\nBut if you want to double check, find a keto carb calculator.  I typed in your stats, assumed you do light workouts, and got carb max @ 20gm, protein min @ 130gm and fat min @ 130gm, and way more calories (1700).  Yup, if this is right, the good news is that you are not eating enough, so your body is holding on to water it doesn\u2019t need.  The bad news is that it\u2019s hard to increase calories or protein on a veggie diet without affecting carbs.  You might have to eat lots of eggs &amp; butter, if you can stand those.\n\nThe thing about keto is that the calorie intake is way more than you\u2019d think.  It\u2019s not based on the CICO (Calories In, Calories Out) principles, but rather that if you don\u2019t eat enough fat, your body thinks it\u2019s starving and holds on to internal fat stores, even if you limit carbs.\n\nYou can also consider doing a \u201clight\u201d keto, which is 50gm carb/day, 120 protein, 120 fat.  That will slow your weight loss but you might be able to stay within your veggie diet.  A reasonable compromise, methinks.",

If you're currently 188 pounds, you should be eating:\n\n**2000 calories/day**\n\n**carbs: 25g/day**\n\n**protein: 100g/day**\n\n**Fats: 170g/day**\n\nYou can go lower if you want (current bodyweight x 10 or 9 as an example) to get your ideal calories. Make sure your macros are set:\n\n75% fats\n\n20% protein\n\n5% carbs.\n\nDM me if you want more info.",

So at the start, you can lose 0.85 lbs of fat per day. That's 386 grams per day, or roughly, 22 pounds a months. Anything more than that and you'd burning muscles for energy. \n\nYou'll probably see a bit more weight lodd6than that during your first month as you shed 4-6 lbs of water weight.",

            "comment": "Op first off ur under on both cals and protien. \n\nIm 5'2 and my start wright, a yeat pre keto was between 260-270. year one of baby stepping changes got me doen to 229. Ladt year in jan i started keto and if. At the time i was doing stanfard high fat keto, though i eill admit that i wadnt doing the 20g carb limit after mutilple er trips from glucose drops.  I avtually started at 50g net carb limit and weaned down.\n\nAt that time i was only doing a light deficit of just over 1700 cals. Mind u, im not saying do that cal amount at all, not even close. I was easing myself into both keto and a real caloric deficit as well as if. Prior i was likely dling ovet 1900 cals, and not counting anything but definatly dking more cico with portion control tactics and weaning out infkammitory and processed crap and diwn carbs. Still was more of a standard diet though.\n\none thing i will say is u should likely be doing closer to 1300-1400 cals max. 1200 is really low.\n\nSecond, afukts, especially women need at least 20 g of complete protien daily. Now, since ur plant based most sources of complete protien are out. However temphe which is a plant protien is so close to complete it gets absorbed like one. So use it.\n\nMake smoothies with a pea or pumpkinseed protien, add coconut cream for fat, or mct oil, or alvacado. Use berries or low carb fruit of ur choice. Add in some temphe for added protien in place of yogurt, and thin a bit with water.\n\nVoila, protuen packed low carb smoothie. \n\nUse as much temphe as u can in every meal. Thriw in some tofu and nuts too. And green beans kr snap peas/snow peas in small amounts as well as squash or zucchini will add to ur protein. Believe it or nkt, some lower carb veg do have decent amounts of protien. And incomplete protien paired with a complete protien will be absorbed like a complete protuen. Temphe is enough of a close approximate to a complete protien it will act like it and still cause other very incomplete plant protiens to be absorbed as if they were .\n\nIf u blend ur temphe, u can make plant based yogurt bowl sub. Add the protein powder and nuts and berries.\n\nHeck, miso soup, stir frys, curry, those are ur new best freinds.\n\nBlend temphe and tofu with cooked turnip or ritabega. Add seasonings and water, and leeks. Voila, plant based protirn packed low carb potato leek soup sub.\n\nIf u add unfkavored protien powder, it will stack up.\n\nHeck, u can maje keto bread, mash sime temphe, add some alvacado and kimchi and make a plant based tuna or chicken salad sandwhich sub. Add plant based prorien powder, inflavored to as many dishes as u can. In fact, instead of xantham gum as a thickener for sauces use plant protien powder .\n\n\nBit yeah, i get getting ur protuen in isnt akways easy. \n\nI will say at the start of keto some do have issues with getting enough protien in. My advice, soread ur meaks out a bit, go 2mad, or if ur alreafy doing that do omad or occasional extended fasts/liquid fasts. That way u can increase autophogy and maybe imcrease ur appetite enough tl get adiquate nutrition in.\n\nIm not saying do them multiple times a week  more like once a week or once every 2 weeks to reset anything in ur bodys signals that are off.\n\nWomen typically shouldnt do 24 hour or more comlete fasts because of our hormones. But 18-20+ hour gasts every noe and then are safe. \n\nIve done some myself unintentially basec on hunger cues. Btw, i currentky aim for a 16 hr fast, am dking 2mad.\n\nHaving probs getting enough protien is kinda a issue with beginner ketoers ive noticed, so at keast for now dont stress ovef it much. The body is still adaptinf up to at least the 6 month mark. \n\nUr what, 2 months in? give urself some slack and do ur best. \n\nBtw, how much is ur fat limit? that may need to be loweted sone to adjust things. That or ur doubg a bit too much heavy fiber foods like leafy greens, chia/fkax seeds, etc. \n\nFiber really is a filler , and with plant basec im sure ur getting more than the average bear. So throw in some higher carb lower fiber veg. Adjust where meeded to compensate the extra and see if that helps.",

    "postText": "So this isn't my first time doing keto, last time I lost almost 100 lbs. Unfortunately life happens and I gained a lot of it back. I've been doing really well the last 2 weeks and I am\n already down 7+ pounds. The last few days I've really been craving carbs. I've done good at not giving in, but I don't remember feeling this way last time I did keto. Does this happen to anyone else? If so, what did you do? Would love and tips or suggestions.",

            "comment": "Are you supplementing and tracking electrolytes? They can help with cravings! Usually my go-to when I get a craving is to drink some pickle juice, drink a couple tall glasses of water, or eat something filling like some scrambled eggs or whatever. Not necessarily all of those things every time, but if you have a craving that is really nagging at you you\u2019re either hungry, thirsty, or low on electrolytes so try and satisfy whichever it is for you. If it\u2019s a really bad craving and the pickle juice and water doesn\u2019t cure it for me and I just can\u2019t bring myself to put a proper meal together then I allow myself to go a bit nuts on cheese and pepperoni. Definitely not the best for you because with all those calories you won\u2019t be losing any weight that day, but better than giving in to carbs. Another option is brushing your teeth, or chewing sugar-free gum.",

And for me that included the quest bars and tortillas. \n\nI've noticed a direct correlation between those foods in my hunger the next day, so I cut them out completely to great success.

            "comment": "I've done it a \\*lot\\* of times. Going strong on about 3 months now...no plans or desires to get off or cheat any time soon. I'm just going to hit you with some bullet points from my perspective; may or may not jive with you, but it's something I'm very successful with so take it for what it's worth:\n\n\\- Down 7 lbs on keto could be almost entirely water. I tend to lose 10 lbs almost immediately upon doing keto, and I'll gain those 10 right back. Don't look at the scale so often, especially when you're this early into it, which leads me to my next point.\n\n\\- In the first phase I think it's most important to get \"into\" it - don't just do keto but become someone who enjoys keto and its benefits and looks forward to more of those benefits and keto meals.\n\n\\- Don't graze or snack. Don't eat the ingredients while your cooking. Brush after meals and keep that minty breath until your sitting down for the next one. 2 or 3 or even 4 meals is fine, just don't be sloppy in between.\n\n\\- Skip on \"keto\" products. Focus on the big things that you can gorge on and look forward to: steak, sausage, ground beef, cheese, bacon, sour cream, avocados. Eat real food for real meals. Don't even worry about the calories at first. Once you're going strong on the actual diet for actual meals, it's way easier to control your portions. Keto will naturally suppress your hungry and it will be easy to cut back on portions after you get going. Forget these keto tortillas, chips, brownies, pizza doughs, breads, etc. Read the labels - don't eat that processed stuff. You're not having that stuff and you won't miss it once you realize how much good stuff you \\*can\\* have that normal people think are bad for you (red meat, bacon, sour cream, cheddar, etc). Also remember unlike gluten-free labels or vegan labels, there's no regulatory agency that is telling you whether products are \"keto-approved\" even if it says so on the label. Get into salt and meat and fat and get out of sugar and breads and ice cream kinda treat. Those sugar alcohols aren't worth it.\n\n\\- Prepare water bottles with salt and \"lite salt\". Morton's lite salt is like $2 and roughly 50/50 potassium/sodium. The iodine and chloride are good for you too. Have separate sodium and sodium potassium bottles. If you really can't stand the taste, adding a small amount of ascorbic acid (vit c) is a 0 cal 0 carb way to add some tang. You want to have a lot of salt, and enough potassium. Magnesium glycinate pills before bed are great to help sleep and just really good for your artery and heart and muscle health long term.\n\n\\- Don't do so much veg and fiber. Really not necessary. If you are light headed or have diarrhea it's because you're not having enough salt. Often its a salt craving that is mistaken for a sugar craving.\n\n\\- 10 minute walks after each meal. You've probably spent more than 10 minutes reading reddit right now, you could have done it while walking around the block. 10 minute walks post-meal are great for improving your insulin response and is more effective than metformin.\n\n\\- Don't drink alcohol. I know this is easier said than done if you drink often. It makes it way easier to cheat, hangovers especially put you in a weak state of mind where you feel like you need to take some easy way out to get over it.\n\n\\- Try to make it 30 days without cheating. Then reconsider. Don't cheat yourself just because you feel like it; plan out the day in advance where you will reconsider.\n\n\\- Remember that having a small amount of carbs/cheating won't \"destroy you\" but it is super uncomfortable to get back in ketosis after knocking yourself out on a carby meal. It's not worth it.\n\n\\- Don't eat carbs. Don't think \"I can have 30g of carbs\" or \"I can have 15g\" of carbs.\" Aim for 0. There's incidental carbs in almost everything from cream to avocado to eggs. If someone asks how many carbs you can have - aim for 0. If you think you haven't had any carbs today but this little candy has 10g, don't do it. It's just going to throw a wrench in the gears. Better eat something salty and fatty like bacon or sausage or even 0 carb jerky. If you still think carbs are a treat you're wrong. It's like quitting cigarettes and having \"just one\". The carbs really hit in ratios, so if you have a high fat, high protein meal, and theres 5-10g incidental carbs, those aren't going to impact you nearly as much as if you had those 5-10g carbs on their own.\n\n\\- Tell people you're allergic. I actually do get some skin issues when I'm back on carbs, and what I'm learning about metabolic density and metabolic health from Chris Palmer's work shows me that the effects on my cognition and brain power are more than mere placebo. I'm not really lying when I tell people I'm allergic to foods when offered carbs. It's way easier to tell someone I can't eat that because I'm allergic than to tell them that I'm on  diet or I don't eat carbs (I'm 180 very lean right now, and usually the people making the offers are in much worse condition, which makes my \"no carb\" spiel sound holier-than-thou to them). Telling them that you're allergic makes it clear that you aren't judging them for eating what they eat while also stopping them from being pushy about it.\n\n\\- Taking really good care of your dental health also makes it way easier to avoid snacks, if you believe every time you eat something you have to floss/brush/coconut oil pull, etc.\n\n\\- Try to fast a bit. Not anything super specific (although there's obviously benefits to occasional fasting), just try to postpone meals when you can. When you feel super hungry, try to wait an hour before you eat. Grow that ability.\n\n\\- After you are \"on\" and comfortable, then you can cut back on portion sizes if you aren't losing weight, but it doesn't have to be dramatic. I eat 8 eggs a day for breakfast, with a bit of cheese, ground beef, small amount of sour cream and olive oil. I have a protein shake with coconut oil and ghee butter for lunch. I have more ground beef and chorizo with sour cream and cheddar for dinner almost every day the same template and I'm holding under 180lbs with 4 workouts a week.\n\n\\- If you cut back calories TOO much your metabolism will adjust and you will have less energy and want to do less while also hanging onto that small calorie count even more.\n\n\\- Good luck, don't be so hard on yourself. This isn't a sprint, it's a marathon. Get into it, learn more about the benefits, keep your electrolytes on deck. Learn to rethink hunger signals as salt signals.\n\n\\- Dont be neurotic about it. Try to get into the feel for it. Don't be in a scarcity mentality of \"i can't eat this can't eat that\", instead think abundance like \"i can do these walks easily, i can eat bacon with my dinner, can't wait for that steak tomorrow, etc\"\n\n\\- Each time you fail there are lessons to learn and each time gets easier than the last.",

You can choose fiber or fat to make you feel full again. Or you can let the hunger happen and ride it out. If you give into the carbs, it can trigger you to be hungry for even more carbs especially if you are kicked out of ketosis. Riding out the hunger can work; The hunger goes away before the day is done.\n\nBut at one point cherry or plum tomatoes with garlic salt was my goto to prevent binge eating.",

Ive found if im craving say something sweet then i need electrolytes sure, but also a yogurt bowl with nuts, choc protuen powder, and berries or anothet healthy keto seeet trwat paired with a lot of protiem usually hits tge spot. Fir example my low carb pancakes which use protien piwder, egg, ans a bit of banana with baking powder, topped with berries cooked in allulose syrup and nuts and maybe snear cheese, nuts in the batter, and a side of scrambled eggs and bacon or a nice steak really hits the spot.\n\nI personally hate pickle juice, so i do ketoaid myself. Im not a big fan of tart flavors, but have gotten desensituzed to it with keto so learned to lije it more but not pickle jiice yet.\n\nIf im craving a savory carb i do a savory sub like cheese, whisps, jerky, or i make air fried veggie chips with root veg like turnip, rutabege, beets, or carrot. These i fibd if i pair with protien work well. Think tuna patty with cheese and veggie chips/fries. Steak and fries, keto fried chicken with fries and fermented veg.\n\nAlso mashed potato subs or sweet potato subs. Like for example low carb mini meatloaf with pureed turnip mash ( i dont tolerate leafy greens or cruciferous veg like cauli mash because of suspected ibs from severe digestive damage from hormon thyroid auto immune condition) or say baked thaksgiving duck and ham with purred carrot sweet potato madh sub. Yes, i opted for duck not turkey. Party of me and my tween son only and was on sake and less expensive per pound than cornish game hens, more tgan one mral of meat tham chickem, and overall cost less than turkey. I got ham slices, not a big one since ya know, meal for two not a army of people. And no, my son isnt doing keto but i do try to get him learning to balamce nutrition amd try some keto subs/meals sk we eat the dame meals. His go to meal is egg and veg tacos with a flour tirtilla he dirsnt care they are now the low carb ones as long as tgey are flour tortillas. He also lijed his pepperoni pizza with a low carb tortilla for crust. \n\n\nIm looking into trying a carnivore pizza crust recipe soon so i can have a soft crust pizza. I may even use it to make a true deep dish pizza sometime. \n\nOp, of its soecific carby foods ur craving try a low carb sUb. If u really eant the carbs low look up carnivore subs so u can get the same kind of flavor and texture with less or without carbs to hit ur craving. Sometimes its lesz a carb craving than it is a wanting a specific food or flavor combo. If u make a carnivore sub that ticks tge roght boxes with less carbs like say a carnivore bread or pizza crust even if toppings are more keto tgen u really can eat all ur fave foods and hit cravings without the adfiction response of csrbs and standard diet. Its kinda a placebo effect/psychosematoc response tl trick ur mind to associate the healthy sub witb the taste and food u usef to enjoy to trick ur brain to not crave the dominos or subway or whatever trwat or food u usec to do instead.",

Keep in mind that you're switching your bodies fuel to fat, and that's a more calorie dense fuel source. \nIf you restrict your calories too low and limit carbs, your body will lack a proper fuel source and go into preservation mode and stall your weight loss. It will also stall other body functions, just FYI. \nPersonally (and everyones different), I had to up my calories from where they would be on a normal diet in order to see the scale move.  This does not mean go ham and eat 3,000 cals a day but be mind full of your bodies requirement and where its cut off is for weight-loss is. You may need to be in the 1,700 or even the 2,000 a day to see the results you need. \nYour body needs fat to burn. That's often the biggest mental hurdle to get over is the \"fat is bad\" mental block. It's not bad if it's a good usable form of fat.",

On keto your body uses ketones to give yourself energy and achieve homeostasis. People are able to go weeks without eating running off of stored fat. I'm not saying what you said is wrong for weightloss (eating more calories will increase satiety and make you less likely to fall off the wagon). From my understanding though, burning ketones will not let you go into metabolic syndrome unless you have hypothyroidism. This is also why people who fast on keto do not experience energy depletion like you experience from the depletion of glycogen stores from a higher carbohydrate diet.",

Remember fast isn\u2019t the goal. Progress and and focusing on the process is the goal. You will build SUSTAINABLE results for sure. Also think long term.

I use happy scale app to smooth out the trend lines.  65 pounds in 483 days - roughly 1 pound a week.  I actually did a little \u201creverse dieting\u201d between Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nI would suggest not doing daily calorie restriction, because eventually your body adapts and you find your BMR a bit lower.  Studies have shown that fasting is a better or at least as effective approach - it\u2019s much better to think of your calories in terms of weekly budgets.  Personally I\u2019ve found prolonged fasting to be pretty amazing benefits outside of the obvious weight loss.  Currently experimenting with doing 5 days fasts starting the first Sunday of every month and that\u2019s been interesting as well.",

Also how are you measuring this?\n\nIf you currently weigh 215 pounds, you should be eating 2100 calories (current bodyweight x 10) and still lose 2-3 pounds of bodyfat per week.\n\nDM me if you want more info.",

There was a long stretch where I was doing a 40% calorie deficit which was probably too aggressive and ill-advised. Overall, I was tracking to a trend line of ~1.35% to ~1.5% lost per week.\n\nAll that being said, I typically see people cite 1% a week on keto which seems reasonable and sustainable.",

Doc says 6 months to level back out to normal after i stabilize and process lipids via liver in due time. Just remember 3500 vals is a pound.. period ! The math works out if you use a scale and properly count cals.. i did zero cardio due to high rate of fat loss",

This time I lose 3-4lbs in a week and then nothing for two weeks and then 3-4lbs and then nothing and so on. But if I calculate it over the period of time I\u2019ve been keto it still works out to 2lbs per week. So what I like to do is write down my start weight on the first of every month and then my end weight in my planner that way I can actually see the hard work because for the most part, most of the month the scale says the same weight and I get discouraged. I also take measurements which absolutely show WAY more progress than the scale.",

Or, include the recipe at the top, and the rambling, long-ass storytelling till after the recipe. I just want to cook a damn Keto casserole, not hear a story about how your nana lovingly raised hens to lay eggs and raised her own pigs to slaughter for her breakfast after trekking five miles uphill both ways in the snow and this is her vintage recipe passed down generations. I'm sure she was lovely, BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE DINNER PLEASE GOD WHY",

Chrome is just Chromium with some Google integration built in, so if you want to skip the Google integration, you can install Chromium directly. \n\nYou should also know that Chrome itself isn't giving your data to Google - that will happen on any browser if you are signed into Google (if you aren't signed in, it is still collected, just not attached to your account). They do this by recording data everytime you visit a website that uses Google Analytics, which is most of them. Facebook and Twitter do the same thing on every page that has sign in or share buttons. \n\nIf you want to keep your browsing history from being recorded and profiled for ad targeting, the best thing to can do is install a browser add-on that blocks third party scripts.

                                    "comment": "My goal for this post is teach you how best to respond to Mr. Vitalik Butterin's mutinous, grotesque declamations\u2014when to analyze and when to assert, when to dismantle and when to affirm. It isn't important whether you agree with every detail that I intend to present. What matters is that you begin to realize that we must provide an antidote to contemporary manifestations of brain-damaged, caustic Trotskyism. Only then can a society free of his stultiloquent vituperations blossom forth from the roots of the past. And only then will people come to understand that he is a man utterly without honor, without principles, without a shred of genuine patriotism. That's why I say that it has long been obvious to attentive observers that the core ethic of Vitalik's league of foul-mouthed witlings has been its brash, unyielding nature, its unquestioning loyalty to Vitalik, and its eternal war footing constantly spoiling for a fight. But did you know that it is my intent to maintain the great principles of virtue, truth, right, and honor? He doesn't want you to know that because he feels that we desperately need him. I forgot his argument; it had something to do with his belief that he's simply misunderstood and is actually interested only in peace. In my opinion, we need Vitalik like a fish needs a bicycle. By that, I mean that Vitalik proclaims that people find his unrelenting, over-the-top hostility rather refreshing. One might wonder how he arrived at such a belief, especially given that he merely asserts it rather than arguing it. Vitalik could have argued instead that some of you are probably wondering, \u201cWhy does he hate our country?\u201d The best answer comes from Vitalik himself. That is, if you pay attention to his wishy-washy scribblings you'll decidedly notice that justice isn't served when Vitalik's crimes go unpunished. Let me recap that for you because it really is extraordinarily important: Vitalik's causeries are an ostentatious, metaphorical digression from the enormity of his plan to stigmatize any and all attempts to unite rich and poor, young and old. At the risk of sounding a tad redundant, let me add that he has stated that he could do a gentler and fairer job of running the world than anyone else. I find such declaratory statements quite telling. They tell me that Vitalik has repeatedly indicated a desire to prepare the ground for an ever-more vicious and brutal campaign of terror. Is that the sound of rarefied respectability that Vitalik's jackals so frequently attribute to Vitalik? The irrational blathering of a sneaky sensualist is more like it. In fact, Vitalik markets his stratagems as helpful and entertaining. In reality, they're a a hellish nightmare from which we may never awaken.\n\nVitalik wants us to believe that his sallies surpass most intellectual discourse in terms of the cogency of what they promote and the morality of their implications. This of course is nonsense without any empirical validity, but Vitalik so vehemently insists that cell-phone towers are in fact covert mind-control devices that use scalar waves to beam images into people's brains while they sleep that this has come to be accepted wisdom, at least by aggressive kooks. I wonder what would happen if he really did make a mockery of the term \u201cdeintellectualization\u201d. There's a spooky thought. Vitalik's mottos are based on stereotyping and bigotry\u2014or, as some people call it, \u201cstrategic hate management\u201d\u2014but I guess nobody ever explained that to Vitalik's compadres.\n\nWill I allow Vitalik to commit acts of immorality, dishonesty, and treason? As long as there is breath in my earthly body, I assure you I will not. What I will do, however, is inform as many people as possible that Vitalik has a knack for convincing the most pugnacious miscreants I've ever seen that obscurity, evasiveness, incomprehensibility, indirectness, and ambiguity are marks of depth and brilliance. That's called marketing. The underlying trick is to use sesquipedalian terms like \u201cgastrohysterorrhaphy\u201d and \u201ccinematographical\u201d to keep his sales pitch from sounding maladroit. That's why you really have to look hard to see that it is more than a purely historical question to ask, \u201cHow did Vitalik's reign of terror start?\u201d or even the more urgent question, \u201cHow might it end?\u201d. No, we must ask, \u201cTo what lengths will Vitalik go to increase subservience to his monolithic engine of voyeurism?\u201d I wish I had a lot more time to answer that question. Unfortunately, the following comment will have to suffice: With all their sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, Vitalik's snow jobs are completely sick. Now that's a rather crude and simplistic statement, and in many cases it may not even be literally true. But there is a sense in which it is generally true, a sense in which it definitely expresses how Vitalik says that he wants to make life better for everyone. Lacking a coherent ideology, however, Vitalik always ends up transforming our little community into a global crucible of terror and gore. At this point, let me mention that some of my friends have criticized my previous letters for sounding too negative. They suggested that I adopt a more positive tone in the future. Well, as I've reached the end of this letter, I guess I can try ending on a positive note: I'm positive that we must try our level best to open students' eyes, minds, hearts, and souls to the world around them.",

Toss grated, chopped veggies:  bell, carrot, onion, cabbage hearts, spinach, jalepeno, garlic egg in the meat( think meatloaf ), chia seeds (to absorb veggie juice), roll em up in pre-boiled cabbage leaves. Put some olive oil and marinara in baking dish. Put cabbage rolls in, top with marinara then garnish with cheese. Good weekend meal prep food and if you boil the cabbage a day ahead it goes faster. Lol my life story+ recipe.  I actually just look at recipes for ideas and just go all mad scientist in the kitchen.... Hmmm.... Maybe I should start a blog?!

She made it for my parents one stormy night in 1985 and that was the night I was conceived, they both had that food in their stomach which is probably why I love it so much! I also love bowling and hate bubble gum.

It can also affect revenue, meaning you can't afford to keep the site afloat. These sites aren't free to run. Also, I never understand why people complain about free recipes? If you don't want a free recipe on someone's website, then why wouldn't you just keep on going or make up your own recipe? You're being offered something for free, it just seems silly to me to complain about it. I know this is probably an unpopular opinion but just thought I would weigh in. To each their own. ",

Same with fruits. It's pretty easy with spices. Got some more of those today too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this how y'all find it works for y'all as well? Is there anyone who always alternates/switches veggies/fruits so that they're eating different kinds every single day? And does this give you more benefits for your health?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's not really the lack of excitement from the same taste. Although that may be a factor. Just the feeling of how healthy it feels for me.",

Or it's something fermented, so the same thing for months at a time. \n\nPlant foods can be interesting for variety and some select nutrients, but by and large, they're not very nutrient dense in general. I don't see much advantage in eating a huge variety, but hey, if you feel better that way, then keep doing what you're doing.",

    "postText": "[Ketoversary](https://imgur.com/a/DYY81tZ)\n\nI\u2019ve been fat my entire adult life. After high school my friends went away to college, I got fat. I\u2019ve always been insecure and I spent the next 20 years hiding behind my fat, using it as an excuse for why I couldn\u2019t do all the things I wanted to. I don\u2019t know what made me finally decide it was time, but one year ago today I made a decision to lose weight. I had heard about keto and done some research and decided to try it. I had nothing to lose but a ton of weight. I found this subreddit soon after I started and spent hours scouring it looking for answers to my questions, tips, and advice. But most of all I looked for the success stories to give me hope that I could do it. I\u2019m generally a private person and didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever post a picture but when I think back to a year ago I needed to see all of those success stories to keep me going. So, to the person who might be on reddit reading this right now thinking they can\u2019t do this: You can do this. Just start.",

It's like solving an easy math problem every day that makes you lose (or keep off) weight. \n\nI appreciated that deviating from the process meant 5 or 6 days to get back in... super strong incentive, because 13 minutes of eating pizza isn't worth waiting 5 or 6 days to get back into ketosis. It has such an incredibly strong positive feedback loop. It's also has a really smart, sneaky CICO/portion control element as well. \n\nIt took a year for a lot of my friends to come around to seeing the benefits, but I have given people information to digests, and 4 or 5 have jumped on board. I hate the cult-ish perception it gets, but if you calmy explain and offer people guidance, some of them will try it out - my approach is always try it out, and if it works for you , it works for you. That is how the person that introduced me to ketp handled it - amid LOTS of skepticism from me. \n\nI'm 2 years and 2 weeks in, and I hit my target in the first 2 months, and have been living lazy keto as a maintenance program since.\n\nCongrats again - you look great... but more importantly, your post really conveys that you FEEL great.",

I started keto over the summer to great results and I'm trying to encourage her to do the same. She complains about her weight often and all the health issues resulting from it but there's always a reason or excuse why diets don't work or keto isn't good for anyone, etc. but I know it's fear and complacency. She asks me a lot of questions about keto and seems impressed by how fast results appear, but is probably daunted by the upkeep and work it takes in order to be effective. I tell her my experiences  honestly and I encourage her to look into it but so far she seems unmotivated. Before you started, is there anything someone who loves you could have said to help encourage you or did you need to find it on your own?",

That\u2019s the only thing I can think of that made it different for me this time. I finally made a concrete decision that I WAS going to lose weight this time and I WAS going to go all the way and I was going to do it for myself to see if I could. Sometimes it can be frustrating when people say they want to change and you want to help yet they don\u2019t take your advice, but sometimes all you can do is be there for them. Let her be inspired by you and help her along when she\u2019s ready. Everyone has their own timing. Maybe she will never be ready, but hopefully she will and you will be there to help her when she is. You are a good friend!",

                    "comment": "I have done 1200 calories the entire time. I know it\u2019s not for everyone and not usually recommend to do that big of a deficit but I did. I did no exercise at all for the first 5 months and I still lost a ton of weight. In February I started wanting to be more active. It came naturally and as a complete surprise because I was 100% a couch potato. I started with walking my dog around the neighborhood and graduated into walking a local 5k path. I started c25k and now I run the same local 5k path 5-6 days a week. I found a love for the ritual of running. I love the way it feels to push myself and do something I never thought I could. I also do some light weight training and boxing on days I don\u2019t run. Occasionally I ride the stationary bike, but I really hate it so that\u2019s rare. One of the most important things I learned for myself is that my diet is for weight loss and exercise is for fitness and mental health. I try to keep them separate because I never want fitness to become a punishment. I\u2019ll take the rewards as a bonus, but I intend to continue long after I\u2019m done losing weight. \n\nThe best advice I can give is just to start. You will figure out what works for you along the way and there are answers to any question you have on this subreddit and support when you need it. The most important part is that initial decision to really start. You can do it, I promise!",

Seriously.\n\nIt's good for you, you should gradually add exercise for health, but it's a minor part of weight loss and should not hold you back from starting.\n\nIf you use the calculator from the sidebar and put in a 20% calorie deficit, you'll have your answer. Too few calories is not necessary and presents its own set of problems.\n\nGood luck!",

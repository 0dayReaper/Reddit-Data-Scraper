Sometimes I crack them and cook in the microwave, or just crack into a glass and swallow raw, or will crack one on top of my dinner dish.\n\nI know eggs are easy protein and Vitamin D. I'm just wondering about the cholesterol.\n\nEDIT: Turns out I can eat all the eggs I want, thank you for all the replies and solid information.",

See oil is in every meal at every major chain in the US sit down and fast food, and it is in every processed food.  Because it is so abundant the majority of people are going to show lower LDL numbers than what is traditionally normal.  Because seed oils are unhealthy, if you start cooking at home you'll naturally start minimizing them, so your LDL will go back to normal.\n\nIf you're worried about health, you want to get your small dense LDL checked.  There are two types of LDL.  Large LDL transports fat and is an anti-inflammatory, so it's healthy and good for you.  Small dense LDL is LDL that isn't being used.  If you get a lot of it due to another medical issue, like the liver can't consume it properly, then small dense LDL sits around in the blood eventually oxidizing and sticking to arteries.  Large LDL is healthy, small LDL is not.\n\nYou should not see elevated triglycerides on a carnivore diet.  Triglycerides are correlated to carb intake.  One can have a range of error of around 15 or so points though.  That is, one can have the same triglycerides but read higher (or lower) by a bit on a blood test.",

I'm a fan of 2 boiled eggs for breakfast + 1 on a salad with lunch or dinner (usually a Cobb Salad).  More than that and I'm risking... issues.  When I was working out daily, I could eat a 6 egg omelet for breakfast, and be fine. More than that is... yuck.\n\nThen again, while I'm not allergic to dairy, I'm not UNALLERGIC to dairy.  A glass of milk is not something I'll often chance.  Maybe a coffee cup of milk.  More than that and I'm unhappy. Same with cheese, 1-2 slices, maybe 3 if I'm eating a grilled cheese, more than that...  ugh...\n\nThen again, all that was before Keto, my stomach is MUCH more robust now.  Carbs were the problem apparently. \n\nWhen I finish up my weight loss goals on Keto, I plan on transitioning to something akin to the Mediterranean diet combined with Atkins.  Complex carbs, just not tons of them.  See how that makes me feel.  If I want rice, brown rice. If I want fries, sweet potato fries (small amount, please). That kind of thing.",

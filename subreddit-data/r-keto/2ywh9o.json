I had infertility issues and had to lose the weight to proceed with treatment. It's been a bit of a yo-yo since I got pregnant (with twins) gained almost all the weight back during pregnancy, but once again had it off 3-4 postpartum. \n\nIt's been a constant struggle this last year. I am ready to finish the journey I started. I have about 50lbs still until I feel I would be comfortable. I restarted last week, already 10 lbs down and entered PISS. Thank god the scale is moving again! This is just to help me continue this process and not get discouraged.  KCKO right?\n\n\nIf anyone wants to be friends on MFP my name is also feferslove on there.\n\nEdit: Thanks so much for the support, crazy how many likes this thing has gotten. I'd also like to thank the trolls, it been a good laugh. ",

I was wondering if you had any advice for keto-ing while also taking care of child? Any easy snacks you would recommend? Also, did you find it was harder to get the weight of after the babies? Once again, congrats on your progress, you truly are an inspiration! ",

Eggs and meat for breakfast , some sort of low carb lunch, dinner is always meat and veggies. Sat and Sun pose the most temptation though. Its so easy to just snack on what they are snacking on. I attempt to make a big breakfast on those days. That is normally enough to get me through until dinner. I also try to make left overs so the next day I can eat it and not be tempted to to just eat what they are eating for lunch (if i'm hungry). I've only very recently had enough energy to start Keto again. Its hard remembering to feed yourself when you are taking care of a child, so it is easy to just snack of easy food. I am having a hard time getting rid of this baby belly. I carried 15 lbs of babies to 37 weeks, I have what they call twin skin. I've accepted the only way I will get rid of it is with surgery, so for now I diet and just try to rid the fat. Keep at it, the outcome outweighs the struggles!",

I can look at something and know I shouldn't eat it. If you are having a hard time track everything, read every label. That's what I do when the scale stops moving.

Also, while I've definitely gone over my calories on nights when I er...partake in the devil's lettuce lol...I've not gone over my carbs, and I've kept my calories to like 1,700 on those nights rather than 2,700 :P My goal right now is just to keep on keepin on - trying to lose about 9 more pounds.\n\nI've lost weight many times through tracking, but I decided to try keto because of others in my life who love it so much. I'm not sure if I'm experiencing non-scale effects or not. I don't have a very good memory for what things are like day to day.\n\nFavorite new product this week is Wegman's cheddar bacon chive cheese dip/spread. It's SO GOOD on burgers!\n\nOh...and cloudies cloud bread!!! Life saver. i know I can make it myself, but I have 2 young kids and no energy right now.",

Im one week in and Sunday weigh-in shows 11lb loss. Tracking macros is not as hard as I thought it would be. Im using the chronometer app.",

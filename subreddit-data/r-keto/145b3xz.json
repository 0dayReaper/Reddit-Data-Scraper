I currently supplement with magnesium threonate, taurine, glycine, fish oil and saffron extract (30mg) daily, all which help.  Thank you!",

For some reason, adderall never gave me that effect. (It had its own issues though of course)\n\nMight wanna try reducing the dose or switching to something else if you think it's worth it for you. You'll figure it out, good luck!",

It's def the meds which contribute to it, since it's not there when I don't take it. I just lose all my emotions and become like a robot and get manipulative tendencies/thoughts. I guess the high dopamine increase makes me want to take any step necessary to reach my goals if that makes sense, which creates those types of thoughts. Even though I'm not on it always, having taking it for a few years now has definitely rewired my thinking/brain into more sociopathic. I think I know what you mean, I can treat people like crap and have zero empathy or remorse. Scary how meds can have such a profound effect on oneself.",

The same way wellbutrin or strattera can ramp social anxiety/awkwardness to the extreme - since the former has nearly no effects on dopamine and the latter certainly does not.\n\nIt's annoying, because I do better with \\*\\*phenidates than I do Amphetamines, but even for someone with zero natural anxiety, the phenidates make me my angsty and weird, talking with new people. Like I'm on edge, a bit, and thoughts don't always translate into words. I need to remind myself to breathe before talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, my tolerance for ALL stimulants, from caffeine/ephedrine to methamphetamine/MDMA decreases **dramatically** in keto. I need about 25% my normal dose to achieve the same ADHD reducing effects.\n\nConsidered reducing your dose?\n\nAnd a non stim, Guanfacine (Despite being a bit pricey) offered me a lot of help with focus and task completion, although, it did nothing for \"taking the first step\" (executive dysfunction). It also markedly decreases my \"talking\" anxiety. You take this on top of your daily stim.",

And that's interesting, I've been doing my normal high dose of 90mg per day, and it has been feeling too overwhelming.

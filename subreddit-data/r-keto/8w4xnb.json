    "postText": "The limit in their jumps was 220, I started keto shortly after the first of the year not as a \"New Years Resolution\" but more out of general frustration, unrelated to the jump.\n\nI started at a little over 260, at my heaviest I was 286 but some recent work had brought me down a bit.  As of writing this I weight 196 which is the lowest I've been in almost 4 years.  \n\nI had forgotten about the ticket and limit until recently on my birthday, when I remembered I had it and went to check.  I saw their weight limit and thought \"Thank god I followed through with this\", I feel so relieved that I can participate in those sort of activities now.  It's even motivating some of my other family to do it too!\n\nI did strict keto, no alcohol, no cheats for 5 months.  I've relapsed a bit into \"lazy\" keto since then and I've started to allow myself a cheat meal once or twice a month, but I'm still losing weight and hitting the gym 3-4 times a week so I've got no problems with that!\n\nStick to it!! It's worth it!  The amount of opportunities that open up for you can be endless, It's liberating!",

You can pay about twice as much and take a 5 hour class to get to jump with your own chute and 2 coaches. It's called AFF. If you love it, 6 more coached jumps and your get to start jumping entirely alone (assuming you pass your assessments). Then in as little as 25 jumps you get a USPA license and you can jump anywhere in the world. It really changes tourism when you think, \"I'm going to see this place from 15 thousand feet.\"\n\nThat's what I did. I had a tandem scheduled with a group and switched it to AFF.",

You are very likely going  to repeat that jump.\n  \nAlso it is a lot more expensive. FJC is around 100 bucks and AFF-A is around 300.\n  \nEnjoy your tandem. If you like it and want to get licensed, then do AFF",

And not to milk the customer. \n  \nI am a private pilot, and when I fly, my well-being depends on altitude and airspeed. Yet on my tandem, I lost altitude awareness. I was looking at altimeter, but numbers were not registering. Mostly because so much other shit was going on around me.\n  \nI didn't fail any AFF levels, mostly because I am also very methodical to my training, and I took a bit of a tunnel before AFF-A. So I was somewhat aware of what I am expected to do in freefall.\n  \nI also know people who took a lot of tandems. Buddy of mine, did 9. Until his TI was like \"Maybe you should get a license?\" and he did. Good belly flyer too.",

Tandems fall a lot faster, but they have a small parachute (called drogue) that slows them down to normal fall speed.

If you are very short, then your weight should not exceed certain limit. It's not for body shaming or anything else, it's all about how you fit in a harness. If they can't secure harness around you properly, they won't take you up.\n  \nHowever, setting a hard limit of 170 for females does not make a whole lot of sense to me. Sure, body is built a bit differently from guys, but not to warrant 55lb difference. \n  \nSome dropzones will publish a chart.

Unfortunately no chart, they said they\u2019d put you on a private scale if you look like you\u2019re close to the weight limit but in my mind 170 on a female can look so different depending on height and proportions. It\u2019s in Georgia, I haven\u2019t gone yet as I\u2019m hoping to be in the 150s when I go, if you want the exact place I can DM it, I just don\u2019t want to give too much info of location.

Well-wishers typically say \"Break a leg\" to actors and musicians before they go on stage to perform. The origin of the phrase remains obscure.\n\nThe expression reflects a theatrical superstition in which wishing a person \"good luck\" is considered bad luck.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/keto/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

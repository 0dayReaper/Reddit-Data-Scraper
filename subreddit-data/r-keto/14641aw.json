    "postText": "After having a baby and the pandemic, I gained 30lbs in a span of 2 years. Tried a lot of things to the point of injuring myself trying to get back to running. Reached 165lbs and after a month and a half of keto am now in my 140s. I haven\u2019t weighed like this since pre-pregnancy and keto is giving me a chance and some hope. I was very wary with it at first due to eating a lot of meat and fat but when I went to the doctor for a checkup my BP was 120/69. After eating all the meat and fat the last month. I am now a believer in keto!",

That's awesome.\n\nNow, a bit off topic...\n\n&gt;Tried a lot of things to the point of injuring myself trying to get back to running\n\nIf you're still interested in running, the best way to approach it is to run slowly (really slowly). \n\nIf you run with your heart rate in zone 2, you'll mainly be burning fat (bonus!), you'll be improving a whole lot of health markers, you'll feel more energized, you'll probably enjoy it more than running fast, and best of all, you'll generally stay injury free.",

From the first time I did keto in 2018 thru 2020 vs this 2nd time starting Feb 2023 I'm concentrating more on how I feel each morning.  I'm also more focused on what I'm truly craving and when I'm truly hungry.  Thanks for the inspiration I was happiest in my mid 140s but I have a ways to go on that still -hope to be back in the 100s by next week !",

I am doing the beginner meal plan until I get the hang of it. \nI had my last baby 2 years ago, got up to 195 and freaked. \nI did a year on BB (beachbody thru a friend) and quit because I was spending money and gained 10lbs. \nThis year I've gotten down to 180 and I'm feeling trapped with snack and sweet cravings! I'm just ready to stick with this and I love lifting, I've been doing it for 4 months. Congrats and you are motivating me!!",

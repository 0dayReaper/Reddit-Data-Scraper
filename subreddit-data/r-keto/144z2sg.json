I also heard the brain doesn't distinguish between fake and real sugar. The only upside is that the sugar levels don't spike as there is no sugar to spike it.

Some of that is age-related. A keto diet with fewer inflammatory foods (predominantly carbs and nightshades) has done wonders for lessening the pain and allowing me more freedom of movement. My orthopedist probably hates me now because I rarely need to see him anymore. Eliminating those inflammatory foods has also resulted in improvement of my chronic colitis: attacks are fewer and farther between as well as less severe.\n\nYou can google \"carbs and lower back pain\" and find articles from reputable medical sites, orthopedic sites and spine institutes. Avoid sites whose ultimate goal is to sell a product, promote a gimmick or otherwise try to part you and your money.

And as far as back pain, no keto won't fuse your lumbar or cure cancer, but it can reduce inflammation which can be painful.\n\nFood cravings pretty much disappear when you're in ketosis. (Not that staying keto is easy). When you totally cut out carbs and sugar, your cravings go away. That also takes away your energy spikes during the day, or more appropriately it takes away the tired/bottomed-out feeling. This can effect depression in a positive manner. So it's like you always have energy.\n\nBrain fog is another Keto benefit. It's chard to explain but while on keto, your mind is much more sharp. Memory is much better.\n\nBeing Keto while doing athletics endurance events is where keto gets really fun. 100mile bike rides without getting tired/bonking AND you don't have to constantly eat food to keep your energy up. Your liver breaks down fat and creates ketones to use instead. \n\nHope this helps. Nurse and long time Keto dude.",

I would think all the down votes and the people telling you it is very much possible might help you accept that reduced pain is perfectly possible on keto.

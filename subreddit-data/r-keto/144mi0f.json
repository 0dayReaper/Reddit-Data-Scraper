    "postText": "I love sunflower, coconut, and tahini butters SO MUCH, but apparently they are high on OMEGA-6, and low on OMEGA-3, which can cause inflammation,and I think I have fallen victim to that a lot. If I could, I would eat those nut buttters all day, but recently I\u2019ve been getting a nasty reaction, especially to sunflower butter and coconut butter, almost allergy-like symptom. I hate it, because they taste AMAZING. \n\nI eat egg sometimes, and I love SALMON and SHRIMP and seafood in general, but they are expensive, especially since I prefer the wild-caught over farm-raised. \n\nAny advice? or TIPS?",

I've blended them into a nut butter before, and with a little sea salt it's amazing. Just be wary that the calories stack up fast with all nuts but macadamia especially. \n\nI cut out PUFAs entirely about 6 months ago now, and it's truly been massively impactful on day to day inflammation and overall quality of life. The easiest way I've found to do low-PUFA keto is to buy lean cuts of meat (90-96% lean beef and chicken breast make up the majority) and add in your own fats via good cheese, grass fed butter and full fat cream/yogurt. Couple of random rules I follow:\n\n-Keep your PUFAs to a maximum of 5g per 1,000 calories but the lower the better. PUFAs naturally occurring in beef/eggs/salmon is vastly better than processed stuff but still track it. \n\n-Source all pork. If it's not explicitly listed as corn/soy free then I won't buy it outside of Aldi's Never Any bacon as a treat for the weekends\n\n-Stay away from chicken thighs and chicken skins unless explicitly listed as corn/soy free. This is where PUFAs accumulate in animals fed corn/soy\n\n-For eggs pasture raised is always best. HOWEVER pasture raised beef is a scam. Unless it explicitly states grass fed and finished they often finish them on grain, corn and soy. \n\n-Make it a point to read labels. Stuff sneaks up on you in places you don't expect.",

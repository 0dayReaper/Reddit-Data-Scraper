    "postText": "Hello, I am taking anti-psychotic med for a mental illness. I read that Keto diet can help for weight loss and mood. But I have a concern if it may be bad for my cholesterol, that gives me anxiety even before starting it. \n\nMy question, how can I make sure it won't affect me heart health and cholesterol? adding virgin olive oil? supplements?  \nOr how about following lazy keto? Low crab?  \nI am lost here and I would appreciate any help",

            "comment": "\u201cWelcome to r/keto! It sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms associated with the so-called \"Keto Flu.\" Please be advised that Keto Flu can happen at any time but the good news is that it can be avoided with proper electrolyte management.\n\n\nAre you getting 5000mg sodium, 1000-3000mg potassium, and 500mg bioavailable magnesium daily?\n\n\nIf the answer is \"I don't know,\" start tracking that intake and supplementing. Electrolyte needs are different for everyone, but these are good guidelines to follow. More information can be found in the FAQ section [Adapting to a Low Carb Lifestyle](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#wiki_adapting_to_a_low_carb_lifestyle).\n\n\nr/keto is not a replacement for your doctor- please seek medical attention if you are concerned about anything you're experiencing.\n\n\nAs a reminder, please read our FAQ before posting.

Your triglycerides, hdl-c, and thus the ratio will most likely improve on keto. Your ldl-c might increase a bit during the weight loss period but it tends to stabilize once you start to maintain the goal weight for months.",

            "comment": "When you lower your carbohydrates, you also lower triglycerides, which are packed in VLDL. Most of the triglycerides get used up as energy and VLDL becomes LDL which \"appears\" to be a rise in \"bad\" cholesterol. However, your non-HDL cholesterol will change very little. Research has shown that the ratio of triglycerides to HDL cholesterol is a very good indicator for cardiovascular risk. On keto a vast majority of us have significantly lower triglycerides. Balancing the types of fats you consume is one way to minimize the impact. A good balance of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats will help optimize lipid profiles while on a keto diet. Foods like macadamia nuts, avocados, and olive oil are good parts of the diet. \n\nWhile cholesterol is not something to be worried about in the short term, a big portion of people do have problems in the first few weeks with a group of symptoms sometimes called the keto flu. The auto-mod provides some information about this. Personally, I struggle with heart arrythmias which existed before keto and can get worse on keto. The advice provided on this sub regarding electrolytes helps with this.\n\nWhen it comes to brain fog, I have found it necessary to achieve higher levels of ketones. Some people don't track ketones as they find it unnecessary, but I track every day. I try to keep blood glucose under 100 mg/dL and blood ketones above 1.5 mmol/L. In full disclosure, the FAQ of this sub discourages people from tracking this kind of information, but there is really no way to verify therapeutic levels of blood ketones without checking. Those with known mental illness need to be careful. When you first start on a keto diet, there is a high probability that you will experience sleep disruption due to a change in the precursors to serotonin (and other neurotransmitters). You may find that you need less sleep for several days or maybe weeks. Eventually your body adapts, finds different pathways, and you may end up sleeping better than you did before. Depending on the medications you are on, things may get worse, possibly much worse, before they get better, and you should check in with your doc.",

            "comment": "How can lowering carbohydrates be bad for cholesterol? Because it is well known dietary saturated fat/cholesterol has a negligible impact. Your liver makes cholesterol, both the good and bad variety. However, excessive amounts of the bad variety of cholesterol is produced due to high carbohydrate intake. This is an immediate way for the body to protect itself from the toxic effects of high blood sugar. It turns the unused glucose into a substance which isn't immediately toxic to the body. However, long-term we know what this fat and cholesterol does to us. The human body is designed to deal with immediate needs. High cholesterol is a way for the body to kick the can down the road so to speak.",

This then turns into LDL and shows up on blood tests as an increase in \"bad\" cholesterol. You will see dozens of posts here just in the last year from people who have experienced this (including me). It doesn't happen to everyone, but it happens to a lot of us. My LDL increased from 119 before keto to 154 during keto. With that said, we have also seen the results of advanced lipid profiles and we know that the LDL is not the small dense LDL that is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease. When weighed against the other improvements in lipid profiles, I think many of us tend to ignore the changes.",

            "comment": "It is best if you do some independent research into the alleged \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d because you will slowly realise the whole LDL = bad and HDL = good is total trash.  \n\nWhen you go keto, increased consumption of healthy saturated fats, your cholesterol will go up 100%.  Triglycerides gos down, HDL goes up and LDL goes up.  This is incredibly common and general blood tests is not enough to make any meaningful analysis out of the LDL because mainstream medicine has long oversimplified LDL = bad.  They fail to account for the large fluffy LDL vs small particle LDL.  The latter is what is bad due to oxidation of LDL.  \n\nI was slightly paranoid with my blood works because I am incredibly fit and my diet is on point 99% of the time.  So everything about my blood test was great, especially my triglycerides and HDL.  Only my LDL stood out and my doctor suggested me to take statin.  So after a deep dive into the scammy industry of cholesterol and statin, all anxiety went away and continued on my diet and pushing harder than last time every time at the gym.\n\nBelieve in the diet, don\u2019t trust mainstream medical professionals unless they look like they know what they are talking about, as in a doctor who is fit with no obvious signs of metabolic illnesses.",

            "comment": "You can text yourself before and after to see if your numbers are improving. Do you have a cholesterol problem now? Your triglycerides will decrease to lower than 100 if you stay away for high carbs and seed oils. Your HDL can increase if you increase your veggies. On keto, you still have to watch your *small*\\-particle LDL. Some on keto report higher LDL. But if it's large and fluffy, then you are still okay. \n\nCholesterol alone is not the problem. Cholesterol helps your cell membranes function properly. You don't want to completely get rid of it. Anyway, you can look at Ivor Cummings videos. He's the keto person (biochemist) who did research on it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaDVuUpIFFc",

It requires you to eat specific ratios of fats/proteins/carbs, and avoid only 5 major food/food-groups.\n\nc) You have the potential to lose 1-2 pounds of bodyfat every week on a ketogenic diet, without lots of exercise.\n\nd) my cholesterol went down after going on keto, but chat with your doctor\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDM me if you have questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck",

Not going to fuck it up myself and then have to start all over again. \n\nI like it as is for now.  Whether it suits my face or my haircut doesn't really matter to me at this time. \n\n\n",

I can't imagine...just looking at myself in a few weeks from now thinking \"Wow. I am kind of amazing. Look what I've done for myself. I am so worthy of all this. I feel great. I look great. I am great.\" That's all I can imagine you must say to yourself when you wake up everyday. I'm sure some days are still hard. Today isn't forever no matter what side of victory you are on...just remember that. I guess if I had those before and after pictures, I wouldn't have many bad days. But it's realistic, that it might roar it's ugly head. Just remember to be proud of how far you have come. You obviously didn't give up and if you did it wasn't for long.

I heard about this keto method while back when there was a publication stating is was not only effective but also healthy. After seeing  your post I really want to give it a go. I currently weight 324lb and never really tried doing anything about it but can you give me tips how you did it and on top of the diet did you go to the gym and work out/jog/look at the jogging ladies asses while you sat back and let the diet do the work..etc. You actually inspired me, and I really want to give this a go. So I guess I should ask what were your usual daily meals like as well as how much did you exercise per week? Thank you for your time and congrats man. Also nice beard, just trim it a little more or don't, it looks good either way. ..Please reply",

I wish I would've,  but I'm a lazy piece of shit when it comes to physical activity. My losses are mostly diet related. \n\nFor meals,  I only eat one giant meal every 24 or more hours apart. That'll be something like a huge steak cooked in bacon grease with butter smothered on it, and then the bacon on the side.  Or I'll buy a 5lb. pack of 70/30 ground meat, and make a huge batch of really spicy taco meat. When its done I'd scoop about a pound of the meat onto 1 or 1.5 oz. of hot and spicy pork rinds and cheese. Made enough for the week and only cost me about 20$ for everything. \n\n\nIf you have any other questions for me please feel free to ask. ",

Just be sure to make sustainable changes for the right reasons.",

            "comment": "I would not advise more fasting or longer fasting, because you're setting yourself up for a crash diet and rebound.\n\nYour wedding is one day, your marriage is hopefully for the rest of your life.\n\nGuess what else you get to do for the rest of your life?\n\nFind a way of eating that allows you to build and maintain healthy habits. The best time to start was yesterday, next best time is right now, in this moment.\n\nThe other thing I would say is... let's say you do crash diet and successfully lose \"whatever\" weight you think is gonna make a difference in 5 weeks. Or you overdo it, raise your stress levels and retain a bunch of water from excess cortisol levels. Now your dress doesn't fit you and you're stressed out and upset when you put the dress on because it won't zip or it zips but puckers in a strange way or otherwise has issues.\n\nThe best way to feel your best is to just keep doing what you've been doing normally, get your hair and makeup done, and smile at the idea that you are marrying someone you love and bringing your lives together. Cherish the moment but don't lose sight of the forest for the trees.",

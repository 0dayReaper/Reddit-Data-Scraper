On the left, we see me before caring about my health and in the middle and right, we see a picture of me from today (with terrible bed hair).That my friends is a 300 lb difference. Sometimes you need to hit rock bottom in order to really make a change. My rock bottom was me going to the doctor because my heart was palpitating and the doctor telling me I was pre-diabetic and that he was putting me on pills. At 25, I fucking refused  let this be my life. I didn't know how I was going to do it, but I knew that this time, I was going to lose weight. Luckily I found Atkins /low carb and later keto and here we are. I went from a 7XL shirt to now being able to pull off an LT. Thanks to a little dedication (stubbornness more than anything else), 300 lbs is gone that will never come back. I refuse to ever go back to how I was. It hasn't always been easy. Even though the diet itself is straight forward there's times where I've over thought ever single I've eaten because I was afraid in the back of mind that it would cause me to go back to the me on the left (scared to have that piece of pizza, or bite of cake, etc) . I've gotten alot better but it still sometimes lingers in the back of my mind. But I ultimately know that if I ever do have a set back, I won't let it undo everything I've worked hard to do these last few years. My best piece of advice for anyone that does want to lose weight is just to start somewhere. Go for walks, count carbs or calaries, go to the gym, find a diet that works for you. I feel like diet plays the biggest part of losing weight. Not popping some bullshit pill or drinking some bullshit shake, it has to come from you. I'm still not quite at my final goal, I'd like to lose 25 lbs more but I can honestly say, I'm so glad I hit this milestone. I'm grateful that according to my most recent labs, I'm in good health all around. And more importantly, for my family and friends that have been there since the beginning and never encouraging me to continue. #lowcarb #keto #atkins #diet #bacon\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/2f05zZK",

You have changed your entire life man, this is beyond inspiring!\n\nJust reading this makes me want to go do things that I've been afraid to do all my life!\n\nI don't think you know how important it is to post things like this. This is so important for other people to see because so many people struggle with all kinds of problems, not just their weight, but all sorts of things in their life, things that they feel like they'll never be able to change. This should give anybody hope and courage. There's like 20 people at my work I'm going to show this to right now.\n\n\nThank you so much for posting! And obviously it goes without saying congratulations, you're more than the man of the hour!\n\nEDIT: \nAlso if I were you I would never throw away that big -ass shirt. In fact I'd fold it up and I'd put it in a fuckin' frame and I'd put it on my wall the way some people do their wedding picture or their diploma or military honors. You should keep it as a visual reminder of what you were able to do to give you strength for the rest of your life.",

I don't mean the 300 pounds lost, because that is obviously a hell of a victory.  A damn fine good job.  But what is the ONE thing you are proudest of changing in your life?  Of improving in your life?       \n      \nNext, what's it like being normal?  Just a regular dude wanting to lose a bit of weight?  What's life like when you are normal?  I hope that question makes sense.     \n         \nDo you still deal with friends and family who see you and treat you as the 545 pound guy?  I freakin' hate that.        \n       \nDamn it must be nice to not have to shop at big and tall stores.  Walking into Dillard's and buying off the rack clothes ON SALE.      \n     \nI love what you have done. Love it because at 25 years old, you have completely changed the course of your life.  Love what you have done because YOU are lighting my path so to speak.  Thank you for this.  Thank you for posting today.  HOPE.  You have given me even more HOPE.  Thank you.",

Thanks new Texas Friend! \n\nMy biggest victory is being able to fly for work and not being afraid of fitting in the seat or about the seatbelt. I flew for work back in July and it was one Fo the best flights minus leg room. Can't change being 6'2 :)\n\nI think I get it. It's a good feeling. You summed it up well. I'm just a normal 28 yr old that lost weight and doesnt feel like I'm being looked at anytime I'm out. I just blend in with the crowd and I'm okay with that :)\n\nAnd not really. If anything, some think I've lost too much and have told me I \"look odd now\". I don't particularly agree with them. That's why I want to lose 25 lbs more. After that, just maintain.\n\nIt really is nice. Kohls has been my best friend. And that damn Kohl's cash is evil.\n\nNo, thank you! People like are you why I love this sub! ",

From that day, I started low carb to lose the weight for surgery.\n\nI hit 450lbs about 2 weeks ago, over 100 lbs down now and am no longer considering surgery and hope to get where you are some day, thanks for sharing!",

What do you suggest I can have that\u2019s cold as I need to take my breakfast to work with me. I don\u2019t have time to cook before work as I have to get my daughter ready for nursery and drop her off before work. \n\nThank you!",

First thing in the morning to get a bunch of sodium in so you're not dizzy during the day. I don't drink coffee but I'll have tea or ginger tea and do the same. Melted butter tastes better to me to drink anyways.",

Another thing I really like is making protein waffles or chaffles ahead of time &amp; eating those- they freeze well, too!

Then I will have a glass of water, then a cup of tea with another 35g of butter or coconut oil. About 45 minutes later I will make another cup of tea with another 35g of butter or coconut oil. With this I'm usually not \"hungry\" (if I can call it hunger because it really isn't) until dinner time, but I will have snacks for lunch like salami with mayonnaise or cream cheese, or beef sticks with cheese. Usually something light as I don't have a normal stomach like others so I cannot tolerate eating foods as easily when I'm downing fat and water and stuffing my tummy with just that.\n\nI will on occasion steal a couple of bites of eggs from my husband.

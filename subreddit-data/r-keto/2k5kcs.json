Maybe more on days where I feel like eating sugar free ice cream sandwiches for dinner...  \nI've been pretty stalled the last couple of months so right now I don't notice much of a change during my period. It always went up about 2 pounds and it still does, so I don't think keto ever affected it. It always dropped backed to normal a few days after.",

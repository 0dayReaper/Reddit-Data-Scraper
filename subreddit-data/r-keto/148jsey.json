    "postText": "EDIT: wow didnt expect such helpful reponses so quickly.  You guys rock!\n\n\nBeen doing keto for around 3 weeks, trying to lose a little carb belly. Saw a quote around here saying \u201cdont eat fat, because you are the fat, just focus on carb limit and hitting your protein quota\u201d\n\nHow true is this? I been consuming \u201chealthy\u201d fats for now and have lost about 3% weight (im assuming most of this is just water weight, as i have sort of hit a wall wrt weight loss). Have been eating gf butter, olive oil, coconut oil, nuts, cheeses, etc, but now it seems like its all actually counterproductive to my goals.  But then one of the objectives of keto is to get 75% calories from fat. So a little confused.",

            "comment": "Adding lots of *EXTRA* fat is unnecessary and counterproductive when you have body fat to lose.  However trying to be very low fat while ketogenic is going to make you feel bad because we primarily need fat or carbs as a fuel source. When you limit carbs, you must increase fat to some extent.  Yes, we can use protein in a pinch, but it is not its primary dietary purpose.  And there are essential  (meaning our bodies cannot make them and we must get them from food) fatty acids that we must eat daily.  So don't fear fat, just don't feel obliged to add it to everything.",

But, with botj carbs and fat those are a lomit food while protuen is a goal u can go over. At leadt if u are dking a wright loss goal. \n\nThis is even more true if u switch to high protuen adequate fat keto like i did in jan tjis year.\n\nProtien really keeps u full so u dont eat ad much or deal with binge tendancies running rampant. It preserves muscle and if u are doing strength training helps build it. \n\nIf ur carns are low enough and ur glucose is too low ur body will convert dietary prorien into glucose sonetimes. These factors make it something u do prioritize.\n\nFat, while u limit it, is also important to keep within a cwrtain range. But, with weight loss, u dont need as much from diet because ur using ur stored in its place. \n\nThat said, u still need a certain amount for fuel but also as building blocks for hormones . In men the important one being trstostetone and in women estrogen. Those particular hormones are inpoetant to manitain bone and muscle mass. They also are important in building lean muscke mass so u can utilize glucose better which really helps a wright loss goal. \n\nBasically, muscles use the majority of blood glucose. To have enough to use enough glucose so u burn fat stores insteaf of adding to them u need a lot of protien and a certain amount of fat. Too much fat or too littke, as well as too lite protien will be deyrimental to this goal not beneficial.\n\nTherefore, priorituze protien, then focos on fat, and fill thr rest with carbs if u like. That way u balance evetything ur body needs.\n\nBtw, those doing carnivore also adhere to this principle because eggs, cheese, dairy, and irgan meats like liver all have trace amoubts of carbs even if mostly protien and or fat. So even carnivore isnt a zero carb diet unless u just eat meat like beef, poultry, fish/shellfish and butter/tallow/ghee/rendered animal fats. And most doing carnivore dont go to that extreme. Even the more simplistic carnivore people do bbbe or bbbec (beef butter bacon eggs, beef butter bacon eggs cheese). \n\n\nSorry about tge rant, hope this helps explain a bit op",

You need glycogen to avoid muscle fatigue and to some extent reduced cognitive function.\n\nYou will deplete glycogen stores with a couple or three hours of moderate exercise if you don't consume carbs during exercise. At that point your source of glucose is mostly via metabolism of body fat, which can happen at up to 300-ish calories per hour, until you become so lean or stressed that the body resorts to the very inefficient proteolysis process (also called starvation). You can very comfortably continue exercise at that moderate level via ketosis but more vigorous exercise requires carb intake.\n\nA very low carb diet will also induce this same ketosis/Krebs cycle metabolic state.\n\nGenerally speaking, there is a level of reduced caloric intake that will cause you to lose weight. However, it's much much more pleasant if that reduced intake has few carbs.\n\nOne or two days of fasting, or four hours of moderate exercise after a few hours of fasting, will put you solidly into ketosis.\n\nMost calories in third world countries are from carbohydrates, with some oils and vegetable proteins, so I have no idea what your point there is. When you're starving you aren't in ketosis: You're eating your muscles, and no one wants to be on that diet.",

It's possible but you'll have to be a mesomorph or taking anabolic steroids. Mostly you will just lose a little less muscle mass than if you didn't lift.",

Replacing carbs with protein is okay in a limited way, but protein isn't particularly satiating, and at some point you're going to make it difficult to lose muscle weight, and will mildly strain your kidneys. Yes, if you're grossly overweight you need to lose a lot of muscle mass in addition to fat weight. That muscle is ultimately coming out of your kidneys as urea and working through that nitrogen takes nontrivial effort by your kidneys. If you have any issues with your kidneys, excess nitrogen processing (protein -&gt; urea) is not good for you. You will notice your urine is more yellow when you are in ketosis, even with a lot of fluid intake. That's the waste product of protein metabolism from food and muscle.\n\nThe processing of body fat into glucose on the other hand is straightforward and no excess nitrogen is involved. Your body can manage 300-400 calories of this per hour as needed. All you need is plenty of water and adequate electrolytes.\n\nSo I personally do recommend that you give yourself a high proportion of fat calories. If you don't like that much fat, you may have to get used to it anyway.\n\nIf you are sustaining your weight, you need to eat less or exercise more, or both. A couple days of fasting or with his of moderate exercise may get you deeper into ketosis and help you understand how hunger is ultimately reduced.",

    "postText": "Pressure cook your meat with a little more than 1 cup of water. Put it in an instant pot. You will get nice soft meat. But that\u2019s not even the best part\n\nThe best part is the broth. The broth is also keto and tastes delicious because it\u2019s been pressure cooked and mixed with spices in there. So good. Add a lil oil too. Amazing keto hack delicious try it out and let me know. \ud83e\udd24",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been doing keto since September 1, 2017 and have lost about 82 pounds. Originally my goals were to lose &gt;30 pounds by the end of 2017 and &gt;50 by my birthday. Beat both of those goals by about 50 pounds. I did it with keto, intermittent fasting, and extended water fasting (longest I\u2019ve gone is a week). It\u2019s not been super easy, and man I\u2019ve had some real bad setbacks (2 of which were &gt;10 pounds gained), but I\u2019ve just about made it to my goal. Once I get under 200 I plan on hitting the gym hard and putting some carbs in my diet (and a lot of protein) to gain muscle quick. Do that for 5ish months, then shred the rest of the year with keto. I might post again on New Years or something. \nAlso a tip: find close friends who can keep you accountable. One of my best friends has kept track of my progress since I started and boy I couldn\u2019t have done it without him. Find people who really want the best for you. \nIt\u2019s funny... me and my friends had a running joke \u201close the weight for a hot prom date.\u201d Obviously not my only motivation but it gave me something to look forward to. If you asked me then who I\u2019d like to take out of anyone, I would have told you this girl Rachel. Just a few weeks ago me and those friends did a big promposal for Rachel (from me), she says yes, and we\u2019re gonna go on a date after. I don\u2019t think keto has nothing to do with this. Hmmmm. \nBut anyway thanks for reading this, KCKO! I\u2019ll respond to all the comments as soon as I can, but today is my birthday and I do have a hot date. \nP.S. I know I look like an idiot with my tongue out in the first pic. And in the other one it looks like I have a really pointy nipple. That\u2019s my arm. Also my hair looks bad cuz I ain\u2019t washing it until right before I pick Rachel up. \n\nEdit: I\u2019m not gonna just pig out on crap when I hit my goal. I\u2019m talking like a cup of brown rice or sweet potato before and after working out. That\u2019s what most jacked Youtubers say, what my twin brother says (who loves keto and is way more jacked than I), and also what a nutritionist told me who did keto to lose a ton of fat. Also I may or may not follow up with prom pics tomorrow. Maybe if this hits 1000 upvotes I will ;) haha kidding. If I\u2019m feeling it I will. But definitely if it hits 1k. Also my flair now says 18!\n[Progress Pics](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/oHjDNC5) ",

So awesome you have supportive friends too, that is so important! Have a great time at your prom, you've earned it!!\n\nOh, and I'm no expert, but I don't think you need to go onto carbs to beef up. Just up your protein to building levels and keep your fats high enough to meet your calories for the day. Lots of body builders are keto :)",

Keto is more ideal for endurance type exercises like running. When I lift on keto it's shit compared to carbed up. As an example, my deadlift will typically go from 3x5 at 365 on carbs to struggling to get 3x5 at 325 the next week while in keto. I think this has a lot to do with keto being a more smooth energy and carbs being more spiked.\n\nNot saying that keto and lifting might work for some, but for me it is brutal. It's like all my \"oomph\" is gone. ",

If you want to build for aesthetics then you may keep the 325 weight, and target accessory movements instead.\n\nAll that to say, I agree with you 100%.",

I now have teenagers. *Everybody* makes mistakes, and I'm not exclusively talking about sex or drugs. As you become an adult, you are faced with more and more choices, and more and more freedom. It's the circle of life! Mistakes are honestly great, it's how we learn! A wise man in my son's scout troop had the best outlook about that. We talked often about how the young men lead in scouting, and how we aren't meant to micromanage or helicopter. Letting them make those mistakes, and learning from them, rather than stepping in every time leads to mature, responsible young people.\n\nI'm kind of sad that you took my comment as patronizing, instead of the compliment I meant it to be.

In a ***very few*** cases, there may need to be supplementation of starch. Think [Iron Cross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzQVA2Jv5Tw) or other anaerobic exercises.\n\nIf you find that, after a few weeks of keto-only exercising, there really isn't enough energy, there is slow-release starch from [UCAN](https://www.generationucan.com/), which won't take you out of keto adaptation. While it was originally created to treat a metabolic disease, they've jumped on the bandwagon for low-carb exercise. I last looked at this (I'm not an athlete.) when it was mostly used for medical purposes. They now have a flashy site and multiple products. Be advised, this is not a blanket recommendation for everything found there. A candy bar is still a candy bar.\n\nAerobic exercise, like running, cycling, swimming do NOT need this. Most body building doesn't either, depending on the stress level. The reason is that fatty acid utilization and ketone generation are fast enough. But for anerobic exercise, glucose is needed, but not a vast amount.",

A lot of the people in this sub will shun the idea of ever eating a carb again but Keto is simply a tool. It is amazing for losing body fat, and horrible for physical performance.  A hammer is great for striking a nail, and a screwdriver for driving a screw, dont use a hammer on the screw my dude.  You seem to have everything going for you so dont slow down..Good stuff. ",

    "postText": "Me: F, 48, 5\u20197\u201d, 61 kg.\nIve been keto 6 months. Lost 11kg in first 4 months, and have plateaued for the last 7 weeks. After 3 weeks of weight not shifting, I mixed it up by introducing IF, reduced fat content and only eat one meal per day. (50g protein, &lt;20g fat, &lt;20g cho and more often than not less than 10g). I wasn\u2019t overweight to begin with, just at upper end of healthy weight. I\u2019m 3kg off my goal weight, which I was at 2 years ago. Wth is going on? Frustrating, as the last 2 weeks have been half the calories at no weight loss benefits, and I know my body is happiest (and able to get to) 58kg.",

You could go 6 weeks or more without a drop on the scale and it still average out to 2 lbs per month.\n\nI suggest picking a more rational intake and sticking to that for 8 weeks straight. Then reassess.",

I just want to get those last few kg off. Everyone keeps suggesting I eat more fat to assist hormones with the weight loss, and I WAS  having more fat and protein originally. The only reason I dropped back was because I stopped losing weight. I gave it a few weeks to see what would happen before following advice to create a bigger deficit. Seems I\u2019m damned if I do and damned if I don\u2019t.",

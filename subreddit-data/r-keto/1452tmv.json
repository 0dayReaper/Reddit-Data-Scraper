Right at the top of the bag it states \u201cstevia blended with other sweeteners.\u201d  A portion size of 2 tsp is \u201czero calories\u201d and it states it is zero carbs. I would like to know what the carb count is for a quarter cup. I\u2019ve contacted the company without success. Can anyone help?",

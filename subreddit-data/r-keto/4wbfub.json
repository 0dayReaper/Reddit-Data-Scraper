Ketone bodies are produced when you enter a constant state of reduced carbohydrate intake (some people function well with fewer than fifty carbs a day; I aim for fewer than twenty).\n\nI still get to eat TONS of my favorite foods (steak and tons of bacon, anyone?) the fat is melting off, and I have lots of natural energy.\n\nI highly recommend the TL;DR section of the FAQ in r/keto for more information!",

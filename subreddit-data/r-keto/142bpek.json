Everything else is just marketing junk, especially when they try to get you to drink ketones when your body already makes its own for free.",

There is no scientific proof regarding it. One site regarded it as very expensive per. No studies, clinical research is iffy at best. If you\u2019re looking for electrolytes you can find something better",

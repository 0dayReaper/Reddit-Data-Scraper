I don't follow a specific target amount, just keep drinking it. I probably drink 2 - 3 liters a day. \n \nPortion size: make and eat a smaller portion than would completely \"fill you up\". It is surprising how uncomfortable feeling \"full\" is after you've grown accustomed to just feeling satisfied but still able to get up and run from a fast zombie, if necessary. \n \nAvoid carb-based meals most of the time: pasta, rice dishes, and pizza are only for fun, not the norm. \n \nFind a veggie and fruit that you love: I'll steam and saute fresh asparagus with every meal and be happy. Switch off if you need variety, but I love fresh asparagus. Apples are my dessert. Bananas are my home from work snack, for the potassium. \n \nCoconut oil: cook with it as much as you can. I mix it with butter when saut\u00e9ing veggies. I found a combo with I think sunflower oil that allows higher heat usage. \n \nAccept food that's offered as a gift or meal when you're a guest. This allows you to avoid imposing your diet as a moral criticism of friends. It's important that you're able to maintain your eating habits while still maintaining friendships. Obviously, judgement and moderation are necessary. Trust yourself that eating a slice of cheesecake that your friend made isn't going to suddenly make you a person with unhealthy eating habits. \n \nExercise: there's really no substitute for it. \n\n",

Some starch from  green veggies probably snuck in there, but I avoided hard veggies like the plague - I missed carrots and potatoes, but I got along without them just fine. \n \nI checked with keto strips most days, and for some reason never had trouble getting back into ketosis in less than a day or two, though I think I stayed in ketosis for the first 2 months solid. \n \nExercise during that period was mostly free weights, though sometimes when a particular station or bench was busy, I'd use a machine. \n \nAnother thing that I forgot to mention in my earlier reply, and I think it's very important, is that I do not drink any sweet drinks, diet or otherwise. Not even a naturally sweet tea. I was told that these trick your body into thinking it's hungry. I experimented with that before starting keto, and lost 6 lbs in a month without altering any other eating or exercise habits. \n \nI would say that my approach has been mostly scientific, but partly psychological as well. I strove to form a plan that would give me the maximum benefit with the minimum risk of failure or frustration. \n \nRegardless of my methods, I know without a doubt that motivation has been the primary key to success in this. Once I recognized my motivation, there really was no major difficultly in following through.",

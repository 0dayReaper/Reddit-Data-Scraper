Then again you are eating like 4 servings at once.\n\nI say give it a try, eat slowly the first time you do this. If you start feeling even an inkling of a racing heart or flushed face, or maybe urgent ass water, you'll know it's too much for you. But please monitor for this. Too much potassium all at once is a severe medical issue that can actually kill you.",

            "comment": "The poison is in the dosage. Higher amounts of either in one sitting is going to tax your systems more as they work harder and faster to revert to baseline. If you're a healthy adult with no issues, then its not going to affect you immediately. Please don't cap potassium or sodium trying to mask taste. I have had the displeasure of creating a stomach ulcer as a result. What you can do is mask the taste of salt through sugar free cordials. I work an intensive outside job and replace electrolytes in a 5lt jug with 5g of half salt half lite salt mix. I have a tub at work with a teaspoon and just use one of those per day. *Edit: it seems I have misread your question, consuming this much salt through animal proteins or other foods isn't going to do anything to you at all.",

Thank you all for the kind words in my last r/keto post!\n\nPic here: http://imgur.com/gallery/4UNaGoD\n(progress indicated by the belt notch wear to where he is now)\n\nI'll be posting his progress as we continue, and I think at the end we might do a full reveal, face and all.\n\nEdit: OMG my first golds ever! Thank you so much! They really go to him. I cook keto anyway, he's the one that's sticking with it! I'll pass them along to him :D\n\nEdit: OMG WE GOT A PLATINUM! Thank you guys, this is really all him. I'll let him know about this thread, he doesn't use reddit AFAIK :) All of you are going to be a huge wealth of encouragement for him! \n\nEdit: OMG 4 GOLD AND THREE PLATINUM HOLY GUACAMOLE!\n\nI'm just cooking enough for four. I make him a dinner and one to take next day for lunch. I also made a breakfast casserole and now we're working on a surplus so he has variety to pick from. Thank you all so much for your kindness :)",

I grew up doing homework in the kitchen and occasionally helping do food prep. I learned my culinary skills through observation and... how does a sponge feed in the ocean? it's like \"filter feeding\"... it's what tofu does when it touches food.. the word escapes me, side effect of these medications I guess. My mom has lived all over the world when she was growing up and she has a wealth of cultural culinary prowess. I wish I knew half of what she knows for cooking. \n\nAnyway, most recently my mom had a double mastectomy in February because they discovered breast cancer reappeared after an 18 year remission. around that time is when my mental anguish started... I stressed myself into a constant d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00eav\u00e9 / d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and it's been every single day and wearing me down mentally and financially with the testing and cooking for my friend and my fianc\u00e9e are two of the biggest sources of relief I get each day. That and Reddit, this community is f*ing amazing. Thank you everyone. Mom, if you ever read this, I Love You and you're my hero!",

I surprised her at the hospital the morning of her surgery... she had no idea I'd be there, because I had to drive from Phoenix, AZ to San Antonio, TX to get there. I think the gesture helped her feel much better about the surgery. she didn't have ANY time to develop any more anxiety to the time she went under the knife, which is exactly how I wanted it! :D thank you so much for reaching out. :)",

                            "comment": "&gt; are some good starting exercises at that weight?\n\nNothing. When you're that weight, falling down can be life altering or life ending. Stay on the diet, any diet, and he should lose a pound a day at least  for months. I lost 90 pounds in 90 days eating 3800 calories, and high carb at that. (400 to 500 grams of carbs, seriously).\n\nTo maintain  600 pounds you have to be eating an absolute fuck ton of calories. His TDEE is at least 7000 calories.\n\nIf he was put on 2000 calories he could likely lose 50 pounds a month, easy. Then once he gets down to 500 or so, just walk every day as much as he can. What I did when I got to around 500 was just walk, sit, walk, sit, walk, sit, etc for an hour a day.\n\n\n&gt;challenge him to walk farther, or faster, each week to help ramp up his calorie burn..\n\nAgain, don't worry too much about that right now. His calorie burn right now is higher than it ever will be again in his life. Right now, worry about preventing injuries.\n\n&gt;I'm going to bring some adjustable weights from my gym home and have him do some curls, lateral raises, military press, and tricep extensions eventually.\n\nAs long as he is seated, go for it.\n\n&gt;I have him doing 1 flight up/down stairs\n\nWait until he gets lower weight for that. Missing a step and twisting an ankle will hurt for a few days for you, but for him it could mean he becomes bed bound.",

It allows for large amounts of LCHF foods at the beginning (so not an enormous change in habits) untill you can reduce the carb cravings and start the process of getting cured of carb addiction.\n\nAlso: while waiting for the weight to be at a normal for activities, one can also get used to ketosis so you don't feel as much exhausted when working out.",

I think he's slimming down quite nicely, and so we'll wait for his weight to reach a better range for safety purposes. I didn't even think about the strain on his knees or ankles, or the risk of falling. I feel so empty headed about that :/\n\nI had a friend that weighed close to 400 pounds that was elderly, mid 60's, walked with a cane. I had him keto and wade/walk around in a pool, a little under shoulder high at first, and I told him as he lost weight and got more conditioned that he should progress toward the shallow end. He eventually graduated from the pool and did elliptical. He fell out of keto after a while but he was down to about 230 and put on 40 over time. Still, a 130 pound net loss and he doesn't need his cane... I'm proud of him, too.",

An injury in high school makes my right knee have a lot of problems that I would imagine are what both of his knees are like. At that size and that type of exercise, you're risking blowing a knee (or both) out, which is a hell recovery even at a good weight. One of my aunts recently had a knee replacement and couldn't walk on that knee, had to use crutches and a walker and stay at my mom's because she has a walk in shower my aunt could use a chair in. He would be bedbound for weeks.\n\n\nRight now, he'll lose more than enough with good dietary practices and simple walking. Imagine being 200 lbs and strapping 400 to your back and walking around like that- there's plenty of calories burned just with the most basic of exercise, even getting out of bed and walking around the house.\n\n\nBe cautious too of dropping too much too fast. It can be dangerous on a small body, but it can put a lot of stress on the heart that's already working hard. Absolutely keep up the hard work, but please be sure he's getting regular medical care - even just with a blood pressure cuff to monitor resting heart rate. If he's on hypertension medication (extremely likely), he'll need to be very careful to notify his doctor right away so his dosage can be adjusted according to his new weight and resting rate.",

I do believe is a sustainable WOE, but it's not a WOE for everyone and I'm proud to be knowledgeable in several different diets to help people reach their goals. I typically switch from keto to a low fat moderate carb high protein when I'm doing heavy weight lifting around my goal weight. \n\nHowever, the diet that works is the one you stick with! Keto seems easy to me, I hope it's easy for you as well. Feel free to message me if you ever want advice!",

                    "comment": "so we met about two and a half years ago at an event for content creators (mainly Twitch streamers) taking place at a Dave and Busters. The event had basically ended and turned into social meet and greet time.\n\nEveryone had their own respective group they convened with, and I was convening with the BARRRRTENDERRR :)\n\nhe was not being convened with at all. He was still sitting at a table, by himself. I saw he was wearing a Blizzard shirt (my favorite game company, until the Diablo: Immortal fiasco) so with enough liquid courage, approached him and told him I liked his shirt and got his name and chatted for a bit about the game company. We had some things in common, it was great.\n\nFast forward several months later and guess who I see walking around my apartment complex looking at the recently for-rent unit under mine. I say \"HEY! I recognize you! We met at the event at D&amp;B!\" I tell him about the complex and that I really like it because it's quiet and I know all my neighbors and everyone was very nice. A couple of days later I saw him again! He moved in!\n\nSo fast forward again a few months, we've seen each other several times but not really talked much. I own a computer repair company and worked alone and so I was pretty much just working myself to death. the girl I was dating at the time had run into him a few times while walking our dog and said he was really nice. I eventually started walking my dog more often and ran into him as well and we became decent acquaintances.\n\nEventually I wound up dating someone else and she ran into him a lot, as well, and somehow we all wound up talking about Diablo, my favorite game. We went to his apartment and chatted for a while and I had been losing weight on keto and mentioned in passing if he wanted to get in shape, I'd be down to cook for him\n\nNow, this was before he ever had my cooking, so he must've thought I was crazy because at the time, I was a 33 year old guy and basically did not exhibit any culinary prowess whatsoever. I never talked about cooking and he wasn't friends with me on Facebook to see my food album. He said he'd think about it. Cool.\n\nA few months later, I was making some roast chicken, my Mom's recipe... i made two small chickens because they came in pairs, and two was way too much for my fianc\u00e9e and myself. I asked him if I could bring him so food, and he said he'd never turn down food, so I brought him this:\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/bEdwQyH\n\nHe loved it. A few weeks later, I was testing the air Fryer my mom got me, and I made chicken parmesan:\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/975ifwS\n\nI sat with him that time while he ate and we talked more about games and when he was about half way done I just got the urge to tell him the meal he was eating was Keto-friendly. I again reiterated that if he wanted to improve his health, I would volunteer to cook for him. I promised the meals would at least be as good as the last two, and all he had to do was pay for his portion of the groceries and I would take care of the rest. We briefly discussed cost, his food allergies and dislikes, his fears (like food monotony), and then we said we'd revisit the topic later\n\nA few weeks later (this is now into 2019), I had started keto again for myself in preparation to get married :D I started on 1/1 and had lost quite a bit of weight (20ish pounds by February). March came along and he said he was ready to give it a shot. I bought groceries on March 30th and made his first meals on April 1st:\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/wWdsIIN\n\nEvery day, I prep 2-3 meals (same protein, different veggies), and occasionally I made a breakfast casserole that lasts 3-4 breakfasts. Every day, I review the food with him, find out what he likes (all of it so far!), find out about his hunger levels, his body responses (like keto flu, thirst, etc), snack cravings, sugar cravings, mental clarity, body exhaustion, and overall feeling of wellness.\n\nI remember the first day last week when he came up to have dinner with us and I go \"dude... you look thinner\" and he thought I was joking, and I said \"no man, I'm observant AF... Your belt is one notch over!\" and he smiled so big and he said \"my friend said I look thinner yesterday. It's very nice to hear :)\"\n\nYesterday he sent me the OP Pic and I lost my shit! i was literally crying so happy for him :) Keeping his progress going is amazing! He doesn't use reddit so I sent him the link when we got to 2100 upvotes. He ate dinner reading it. I think, despite being a private person, he really enjoyed it. This community rocks. Thank you everyone!",

Don't drink too much alcohol, stay hydrated with at least a few litres of water a day and moisturize your skin(regular moisturizer, coconut oil or DIY your own moisturizer cheap with vegetable glycerin and water). I think cold showers might be good as well, but I have no proof, worth a shot since they have other great benefits.\n\nThen you've done everything you can to give your skin the best chance it can get to bounce back. Any skin left is out of your control and you'll have to accept it. If you're a dude you could try filling it with muscle otherwise a painful surgery is in place.",

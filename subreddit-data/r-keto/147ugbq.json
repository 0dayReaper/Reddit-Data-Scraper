    "postText": "Just wondering what some of you do after hitting your weight loss goal (if that was the primary goal of going Keto). Do you continue the Keto diet, make modifications to allow more carbs, go back to the diet you had before, something else? \n\nI initially started in January with a weight goal of 205 pounds, and I hit that a little over a month ago, and have since lost about 7 more pounds. I'm currently wondering \"where do I go from here?\" I certainly enjoy having lost the weight I did; I feel better and think I look better. However, I would like to enjoy pizza again at some point haha (among other things). Maybe I can reintroduce certain foods in moderation? My big fear is eventually creeping back up to my starting weight and undoing all the work I put in the past 5.5 months. \n\nSo, what's your plan? What did you change (if anything) after hitting your weight goal, or whatever goal you set for yourself?",

As soon as you start to gain, drop back five at a time. He encouraged that the carbs be low sugar fruits, healthful complex carb veggies like sweet potatoes, brown rice, etc\u2026 you could probably play around with the numbers like a Weight Watchers \u201cpoints\u201d and maybe \u201cbank\u201d your extra carbs for date night or holidays. I think the main thing is just not to go back to disordered and unmindful eating.",

I did keto lost a ton of weight , maintained a little then fell back into my old eating habits and her I am back again! But this time when I get to where I want to I have to still keep very low carb, I don't need to be in ketosis , but I will still try and keep track of my calories.

In the beginning it was actually just crash diet, but then after the first 15 lb or so I started keto because a friend saw me avoiding sugar and mentioned it. That's how I lost the rest of the weight. However, I was eating at a caloric deficit the entire time. I'm sure somebody could sustain strength training while keto, but I couldn't do it. It's just too hard, and it's just too easy to eat a couple packs of oatmeal with a chicken breast before a workout.",

After 16 months of sustained keto, the thought of sex became such an issue with, that it drove a bit of a wedge between my ex partner and I. Even on TRT. Now, i'm back to where I was in my early teenage years.\n\nBut a cheat meal is a starchy carb. And it's on a workout day. For me, yesterday, it was sushi. Not candy, not chocolate cake, and I avoid fructose like the plague. Then, it's back to 2000kcal of green veg and meat and nuts for the remaining 13 meals a week (I eat 2MAD).\n\nThe side effects are what you'd expect. Extreme thirst, gained about 6lbs of water weight. I'm hungrier more often for a day or two. I get much warmer, which sucks, as part of the reason I like keto is how cold I feel, and working as a chef in a 35-40c environment, that's a massive benefit. I guarantee I'll be sweating my ass off tonight, and that's not ideal.\n\nI'm going to see if I can keep this up for 6 weeks without issue, then re-evaluate. If my weight doesn't go in the direction I want, I'll figure something else out. Never had a food addiction or much of a sweet tooth, so I'm sure this works in my favour.",

For instance, I have never had a huge sweet tooth or been a big pasta/pizza/bread lover, so I feel confident that the occasional carby meal isn't going to put me on a slide toward bad eating habits. I gained weight more from not losing it entirely after having kids, being lazy/not working out, and generally not paying attention to what I eat. So I plan on very slowly reintroducing some healthier carbs that I miss- like oatmeal, fruit and beans back into my diet once I'm ready. It might be harder though if you really do tend to crave a lot of carbs to bring them back in and keep the cravings away.",

So, if you miss green beans or broccoli, add them for a week and see what happens.",

I make a keto pizza (more of a keto casserole) that I would take over papa johns any day, and for example a taco can be made the keto way by only using a low carb tortilla \ud83d\ude06, just don\u2019t go back fully to junk food and your good.",

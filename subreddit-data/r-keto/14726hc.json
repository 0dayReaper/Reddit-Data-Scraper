    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI\u2019ve done a ton of research on the benefits of keto and also low carb. I made a post earlier about which way of living is more sustainable but what I\u2019ve failed to find is exact information as far as fat loss. IMO low carb sounds a lot more sustainable however I have PCOS and it\u2019s way harder for me to lose weight. Keto has done wonders for me (23 pounds down in a little over 2 months) but is it necessary to be in ketosis? Has anyone here switched to low carb and reaped the same benefits in the same amount of time? I know weight loss should be slow and steady but I don\u2019t want to take twice as long to lose weight. \n\nThank you in advance!",

Keto adaptation allows the body to burn more than twice as much fat than you can otherwise.  He has the advantage of data behind his opinion.",

                    "comment": "Okay so you are pretty much openly stating that keto makes people lose more than twice the amount of fat than a low carb or high carb diet, when on a similar deficit. Most people just argue that keto is slightly more efficient but here you go saying it burns TWICE as much fat. \n\nDo you realise how big of a number that is? Studies are celebrated for finding something that increases efficiency by a few percentages, and here you are saying keto increases it by 200%!\n\nPer my knowledge all studies comparing different macro ratios, including keto, have shown no difference in the amount of fat lost, when protein is constant. I would love to see a single study showing that keto burns twice the amount of fat than other macro ratios.\n\nIt also doesn't make sense practically. It's common knowledge that to lose weight we should be on a deficit of or less than 500. By that we lose one kg a week, so 4 kgs a month. More than that is considered dangerous and unhealthy territory. You're basically saying if two people are on the same 500 deficit, the one on keto will lose more than 8kgs a month.",

That's what i meant, not sure if that's correct. Statistics are really not my thing.",

You're just repeating what another guy is saying?\n\nI did skim over the video, at the 25 minute mark as you said. There was no mention of studies where keto makes you lose twice as much fat on the same deficit.\n\nThe description or comments do not have links to any studies, nor did the speaker reference any in the time i watched it. I am not going to watch a whole 1.5 hour youtube video to see if somewhere he references the actual studies that prove his ridiculous point. \n\nIt's really the same logic when someone asks a person to provide proof for their statements and they refer you to fung's book or something. If you know what's what shouldn't you be able to explain it yourself? Since you seem to have watched the whole lecture maybe you know where he references these specific studies, that's all i'm asking from you. Actual evidence. Not a 'conclusion' that someone derived from 'research' that nobody else can seem to cite.\n\nAs an example these would be considered evidence-\n\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4962163/\n\n\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0804748",

While multi factorial, PCOS is a metabolic disorder that responds well to reduced insulin insulin resistance. Keto/low carb reduces insulin (among other things) and is being used by some professionals as part of an overall treatment plan.\n\nKeto is what I would describe as being on the lower end of the low carb spectrum. In terms of weight loss, it is probably more effective in terms of the rate of the weight loss compared to eating, say, 50-100g of carbs a day but the reality is amount of carbs for you is the one that you can achieve given your circumstances (and what symptomatic relief you are seeking for your PCOS). Strict keto (under 20g carbs) can feel very restrictive for some people.\n\nSafe to say most of us are guilty of wanting to drop weight as fast as possible but I have certainly experienced rapid loss, hit a hurdle and decided it was all too hard. I\u2019ve now found a level of keto-low carb that I can sustain - including consideration of food as part of my social life - and am accepting of the rate of fat loss I am seeing as a result.\n\nAll the best!",

The short answer: no.\n\n&gt;Urine testing strips (commonly referred to by the brand name Ketostix) are intended for type 1 diabetics to monitor for a condition known as diabetic ketoacidosis or DKA. DKA is a life-threatening condition for diabetics which occurs when both blood glucose and blood ketones are high. However, if you are not an insulin-dependent diabetic, your body cannot go into DKA.\n\n&gt;Ketostix measure excess levels of one type of ketone body, acetoacetate, in the urine. While in nutritional ketosis the body produces three types of ketone bodies: acetone, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). As the body becomes fat adapted two things happen: it becomes better at using ketones and it starts converting acetoacetate into BHB. This means that there will be less excess ketones and less of the only type of ketone measured by Ketostix. source.\n\n&gt;Some people mistakenly assume that more ketones = more weight loss. This is false. Urine ketone concentration is highly dependent on a person\u2019s level of hydration - someone who is eating a ketogenic diet and drinking a lot of water might not even register as having ketones in their urine. Urine concentration also only shows ketones that the body determined were \u201cexcessive\u201d and excreted in the urine. Testing your urine does not provide any insight into the current state of ketogenesis in your body and bloodstream.\n\n&gt;Urine ketone testing can produce both \u201cfalse positives\u201d and \u201cfalse negatives.\u201d As stated above, as your body adapts to using fat and ketones more efficiently, there are fewer excess ketones made and consequently, fewer excess ketones excreted in urine. This can result in a \u201cfalse negative\u201d on the strip if someone who has been eating keto for awhile uses one and sees no result, again as discussed above. This does not mean you are not in ketosis, just that your body is using its ketone production system more effectively.\n\nKeep net carbs at or fewer than 20g a day and you\u2019re either in ketosis or you\u2019re dead, no need to test whatsoever.",

However I started indoor cycling and started seeing the weight fly off and I noticed dang recoveries ain\u2019t hitting and I\u2019m starting to struggle once I was at 50 lbs down. I added in more carbs but definitely no more than 30-35 and started feeling better and being able to go hard again. \n\nEnter road cycling I\u2019m loving it and doing 20-30 mile rides fasted and progressed to 100 mile weekends rather quickly but the recoveries are starting to be stretched out and my indoor riding is now taking a hit too but I\u2019m 100+ lbs down. I think everyone\u2019s body is different. I love cycling and it made me realize I was no longer willing to be strict keto although it was a fantastic start and helped me with discipline, satiety, IF, and pushing my fitness a bit.  \n\n\nI previously lost 100 lbs on keto and unfortunately between pandemic, childbirth, breastfeeding it came back because I stopped foolishly but learned my lesson there.\n\n\nBiggest difference this time is I have a sustainable habit that allows me to eat those carbs for fuel and although I\u2019m still learning my limit (hate waking up knowing I\u2019m holding on to water weight or weird poops (sorry) low carb is great but keto allows you to form a relationship with the lifestyle and then from there you can choose which way benefits you best. \n\n\n\n\nWishing you the best on your journey OP!",

I think life happens and we just have to find a sweet spot (pun intended-too much of a cycling nerd \ud83e\udd13 now) between the intensity, consistency, and preservation we need to manage our bodies\u2019 health. There\u2019s something different this time for me where I don\u2019t see myself not cycling everyday. I recently took a week to go visit my parents so they could spend time with their granddaughter and I told myself which do you want more: more work training or easier training? I know if I get rid of the last little bit of weight this 100 mile ride I\u2019ve got will be a lot easier if I\u2019m in a better shape! So all that to say I hope you\u2019re able to get back to cycling more so you can carve out a spot for your health on the bike too! Sending you good vibes for some great rides and great health and the best to managing your health and lifestyle! Enjoy the bike! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd",

The worse your IR the more insulin your body has to produce to deal with glucose spikes and insulin is a principle factor in fat regulation. Keto and low carb both work by keeping insulin levels low, but the amount of carbs you can tolerate depends on how much damage you've already done to your body.",

It's never just once. The only fast carbs I allow are the whole milk in my coffee, which I limit to two cups a day. I had fallen off Keto for about a year and getting back on was hard, but this month I stayed on. My cravings are back under control, but even so, weight loss took three weeks to start.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mnhha9JfCM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mnhha9JfCM)\n\nWhile there are lots of endocrine reasons why insulin reduction is critical for ketosis and burning fat, that alone would not reduce weight. A different view of why it loses more weight is that calories don't weigh anything.  I've never been a fan of calories-in-calories-out since how your body process food varies so much.   But the key in this theory is that while you need to be in an energy deficit, keto requires fewer actual grams of food to hit the calorie goal so overall mass-in is lower than on other diets, and weight loss = mass-in - mass-out.     This is just a new theory but I found it very compelling.",

Undiagnosed currentky but have tefderal to a gastro, and have symptoms that scream ibs like severe gas, bloatong, spray paint poo every time i eat leafy hreens ir crucifetous veg, even if fermented. Raw veh also really mess me up bad \n\nAs u can imagine, like with pcos i have hormone issues that really make wright loss hard. I alsi have a histiry of nutrient deficiemces caused by tge same issue.\n\nIm no fad dieter. Im not a keto is the only option, keto nazi cult type either. So im not gonna say that it will be what u must do, ur only option, etc.\n\nBut thats nkr what u are asking for, ur asking for a compairison of low carb vs keto. That i can and will be able to provide based on my own baby stepping changes for 2.5 years now.\n\nYear one, start weight was between 260-270 pounds . Severe reactive hypoglycemia on the verge of prediabetes i suspect. This caused severe migrains almost daily and repeated er trips because tge pai  caused nausea so bad id have trouble holdibg down water. Severe digestive ulcers that went inyo lower gi causing severe stabbing stomach paim 15-20 min after eating or dtinking anything including water, and over a montj shittinf bright red blood. Chronic pain issues. Fatigue. Insomnia. Repeated respuratory and sinus infections including alkergy induced brochitis bad enough to cause my coyfhing to crack ribs. Increasibgly bad eczema. Increasing severity acne. Reapeated yeast infections bith feminine and in skin creases that sometimes became open sores. No appetie control at all. Bine density issues. Brain fog. Anemia. Nutrient deficiencies. Increasingly painful periods that were more and more irregular. Hereditary asthma getting worse making excersise 100% impossible. Etc.\n\nThat was my start point. I implimented weaning down carbs to more of a low carb standard diet. Wrmeaned out inflammitiry foods. Nixed things like seed oils. Implimented portion control tactics based on portion reduction and dish size reduction to target a subconcieous psychosematic response. \n\nDid not track anything. had signifigant improvements of symptoms and in a year reached 229 pounds . Still was very sick, labs still in red zone. That was from jan to december of 2021.\n\nIn jan 2022, i startef keto and if with a 50 g net carb limit . Was at 229 pounds. Tracked everything, weaned slowly up gasting window and down carbs. By may i was back on meds for my hoshimotos because holistoc alone was no longwr working (id stopped in jan 2021 because meds had zero effect between layr diagnosus and hereditary high med tokerance) and started slowly adding excersis. By tgen my carb limit was 35g net i think.\n\nBy decamber, my med was lowered, i was aroubd 180 pounds , most labs were in the green, and my tsh was onky slightly high, but at one loint had been in the green  and another dropped below normal. So that was in flux. All symtoms gone or minimal. \n\nIn year one i lost around 50 pounds . In year 2 i lost around 50 pounds . Same progress in weight, but the health issues aside from that vastly improved with keto and if than without.\n\nAlso, i find keto really sustainable since im a mentally disabled single mom on ssi and foodstamps. There are loads of cheap food options that are keto safe, or carnivore. Also, i make quite a few of my own foods, and produce a good amoubt of my iwn veg tgrough gardening both in pota at my apt and in my newly aquired cimmunity garden plot, or foraging on walks in my neighborhood.\n\nClearance items, on sale items, couponed are my biggest cost savers. And i can eat a lot of veg, even higher carb if i pick tge right ones. Squash, zucchini, eggplant, tonatoes, onion, mishrooms, sweet peppers are my main staples. Though i also do snsl beans (fresh green beans) snap/snow peas. I do apples and berries as my msin fruit, along with sometimrs sakt fermented lemon or a small amount of banana.\n\nI dont avoid dairy, just mostly use cheese or make yogurt/skyr. I dont nix legumes, but minimize. I dont really buy keto products. Though i do have a grand total of 2 in my home at tjis time. Ive got keto hot dof buns so me and my son can have hot dogs together (his w ketchup, mine with melted cheese) and ive got keyo tortillas for tacos/wraps/single serve keyo crispy crust pizzas.  I do noy buy keto bread, its way over priced in my area though i have a few keto breaf recipes ive used and more im expetimenting with, mostly carnivore bread recios at the moment.\n\nIve got subs for chips, fries, tuna salad sandwhiches, potato leek soup, potato salad, pizza, spagjetti, doughnuts, trail mix, fudge, cranberru sauce, mashed potatos, madhed sweet pitatos, pancakes , muffins, tuna burgars, meatloaf, etc. \n\nAll of those standard western diet foods, i mostly can still enjoy with keto if i mildky change ingredients and do different portions. So it is sustainable and quite easy to do even if im keto and my kid isnt. I can still enjoy the same food as my kid and us eat together with minor tweaks to his or my meal. He gets 3 hot dogs and chips? i do one on a keto bun and a yogurt bowl with a side of meat. He had pizza? i get pizza and sauteed veg. He gets a rootbeer or sprite? i get diet root beer or sprite. He gets gatoraid, i make my owb ketoaid. he wants choc milk, i do a smoothie with choc protien powder. \n\n\nTotally sustainable. He wants choc, he and i both do lillys choc or i do lillys he gats a small amoubt of resses or hersheys. \n\nSo yeah, benefits to keto are less for weight with me, but more ablut overall health improvement. And it is sustainable, well balanced, and very veristile. \n\nI think that checks all ur compairison and pro vs con boxes acckrding to ur post. \n\nAs to weather u should or shouldnt do it? up to u. Give it a go and decide for urself, or dont. U knoe urself best and what will or wont help or work for ur needs. Humans arent one size fits all, and keto may not fit for u  then agsin, it might. Ull find what wotks for u in ur own time through trial and error . I did that, and keto was what wotks for me.",

            "comment": "My experience is that I lost more weight faster on Keto in the beginning of my weight loss journey when I had a lot to lose(70lbs). I can still lose weight on low carb in a caloric deficit (as long as I'm not eating junk/processed carbs!). I've been doing low carb a couple weeks and eating more fruit and veggies and lost 2 lbs (I'm near my goal weight so losing is tough these days) My last Keto cycle I didn't lose any lbs or inches. Low carb can be a slippery slope of letting some carbs in that aren't the right sources and then you get cravings again so you might want to keep track for a little while of what you eat and how it affects you.  I do cycles of each depending on the time of year and how I'm feeling. I like veggies and berries and tend to eat a lot more of them in the spring/summer so I shift to more low carb (I usually stay under 75 total carbs). I eat my carb sources with protein/fat and eat the bulk of them in the morning or afternoon when I'm most active. Fruit I always eat  after my main meal. For a snack you could do yogurt/fruit, cheese or some nuts and fruit, beef sticks and fruit. I find fruit doesn't give me issues (with weight loss or water retention or anything negative) as long as I pair it with protein and don't eat a bushel of it. lol",

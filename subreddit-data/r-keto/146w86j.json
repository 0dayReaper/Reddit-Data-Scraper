They have what's called exogenous ketones, which will technically raise your blood ketone levels. What it won't do is put your body in fat burning mode. Only a lack of glucose from dropping carbs below 20g net will do that.",

If I was hungry outside of meals, it was usually due to not enough fat in the last meal. \n\nIt is the easiest meal plan I have ever followed and been long term successful at. \n\nI didn\u2019t use any Keto gimmicky food or supplements.\nYou can\u2019t buy \u201cketones\u201d.

But really, keto is just cutting out carbs and sugars so the body no longer runs on glucose but starts burning fat.\n\nAs in anything, it's not magic either. If you eat too many calories, you will not lose weight. The nice thing about keto is, eating in this way tends to make you less hungry.",

Even if you\u2019re not on the keto diet they are much healthier than binging a bag of sour patch kids. But it\u2019s not like they, or any food, is some kinda weight loss drug that works like magic. Beware they have a lot of fiber.\n\nIf it makes you feel better I am also 5\u20196 and 55 days ago I was 207 and now I am 193 through daily caloric intake of 1300 with no more than 24g of carbs each day and taking 30 minute walks 4 times a week. I struggle with trying to eat less because I always feel hungry but being in ketosis keeps the hunger in check (which is like magic for me). It\u2019s a hard diet to get used to but I\u2019ve found my groove and I hope you find what works for you.",

I get 20% of my carbed up \"pump\" back after a month or so, but I'm also so much leaner from all the lost water weight, so I actually end up looking much more defined.\n\nI carb up with starch or dextrose for the one random day a month where I might need to get naked for whatever reason. 200g, a full body workout, and a few liters of water.\n\nAs for muscle retention, exercise and proper protein intake is all you need. Along with adequate calories.",

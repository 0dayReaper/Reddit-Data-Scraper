It's a good one to reference because it's a systematic review and meta-analysis, meaning it combined data from many different studies to get more reliable results. Also, it was published in the European Journal of Epidemiology, a well-regarded peer-reviewed journal. It found that high consumption of red and processed meats has been linked with increased risks of several types of cancer. a quick explanation of what the numbers mean. (RR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.03-1.15) means associated with a 9% increased risk of developing cancer, with the true increase in risk likely falling between 3% and 15%, based on the 95% confidence interval. im not a scientist or doctor but i believe there is a broad scientific consensus that consumption of processed meats is linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer, notably colorectal cancer. This link was officially recognized by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2015.\n\nThe evidence regarding unprocessed red meat is less clear, with some studies suggesting a potential increased risk of certain types of cancer, while others do not. The IARC classifies red meat as a \"probable\" carcinogen, a category that reflects some degree of uncertainty. However, the trend in the research suggests that high consumption of red meat might be associated with an increased risk of certain types of cancer. Personally, I limit red meat more than other meats.",

So the risk of cancer (particularly colorectal cancer) increases proportionally with red meat consumption. But, risk doesn\u2019t equal occurrence (because everyone\u2019s different) so you can\u2019t accurately know your real risk (hence the inconclusiveness). Still, I suggest varying your meat consumption to include poultry, fish, pork and some beef, just to be on the safe side.",

To top it off, even if there *is* a 15% increased chance, the high end of the above linked study, that's not even very significant. According to The American Cancer Society, the overall lifetime risk for colorectal cancer in men is 1 in 23 and in women it's 1 in 26 [(source)](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html). So about 4.35% and 3.85%, respectively. If we increase that by 15%, those values become 5% for men and 4.43% for women. This doesn't even take into account the decreased risk once all your blood work is perfect and you're likely eating in a small time window if you're following even moderately strict Keto. Bottom line: hardly a cause for concern, even in the linked study's worst-case scenario.",

Colorectal cancer is the #2 or #3 leading cause of cancer in the US (depending on gender) according to the American Cancer Society. Main causes are diet and lifestyle. Diet risks are red meat, processed foods (nitrates/nitrates) and carbonized (BBQd) meat. Sugar is not in the mix here. Low carb is good. Heavy reliance on red meat is not good. We\u2019re talking cancer here, not other benefits/detriments from low carb. A global view on diet and its relationship to overall cancer risk is recommended by ACS, WHO, NIH, etc. So just be cognizant and evaluate all of this along your journey to health and well being.",

I'm not convinced, however, that the possible, very slight, increased risk from relying heavily on red meat outweighs the benefits of a mostly or even an all meat/animal product diet, for a huge amount of people. Have you checked out what PaleoMedicina has been able to accomplish with the Paleolithic Ketogenic Diet (pkd)? [Here](https://paleomedicina.com/en/paleolithic_ketogenic_diet_as_a_stand_alone_therapy_in_cancer) are a couple case studies of them managing cancers using pkd as a stand-alone therapy. And they aren't the only ones. The link from red meat consumption to cancer, from what I've seen at least, is largely supported by epidemiological studies (surveys), and meta analyses of epidemiological studies, with some exceptions. Once we have more studies in on people strictly adhering to a red-meat-only or red-meat-centric diet, we can draw better conclusions about red meat because it'll be able to be more isolated from other factors. Anecdotally, I and everyone I know who has switched from standard keto to a keto diet primarily consisting of red meat, eggs, and organ meats, has felt markedly better. I still eat broccoli and some other occasional veggies, too, but 90% or more of my food is animal-derived and the vast majority of that is beef. It is particularly helpful for people with joint pain and arthritis,as well as digestive issues like Crohn's disease and IBS because of how little inflammation occurs. For me, being able to walk comfortably versus being in constant mild to severe pain far outweighs a jump from 4.35% risk to 5% risk, if that's even the case. Definitely reiterate though; n=1, so it's really important for people to research and try what works best with their body and what makes them feel best, as well as to keep in mind added risks of the choices made.",

Perfect example of this is when people supplement calcium for whatever reason, without realizing that unless you are consuming Vitamin K2 alongside it, it will not be shuttled to where it needs to go and instead will deposit on your arteries, calcifying them. \n\nCronometer tells me all the time that I am way over on calcium, zinc and niacin, but I only obtain them through food so it really doesn't matter because my bloodwork/nutrients comes back perfect every time.",

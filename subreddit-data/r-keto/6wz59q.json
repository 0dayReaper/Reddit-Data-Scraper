    "postText": "Had bloodwork done last week.  Went in to see the PA at my doctors office.  Posted about it last week.\n\nWell, the doctor himself called me just now and was pretty was floored.  He said I dropped my A1C from 9.0 to 6.6 and there is no way metformin alone can do that.  He said 6.5 is considered \"not diabetic.\"  And he wants to know what exactly I am doing.\n\nI just said \"ketogenic diet.\"  He was silent for a minute and just said \"Really?\"  The he said \"Just keep doing what you're doing.  I've never seen a 9 go down to 6.6.\"\n\nFeeling pretty proud of myself.  Sorry for bringing this up again after only posting about it last week.\n\nType II diabetics on keto, have hope.  You'll get your blood sugar under control with this diet, and you'll live long enough to see your grandchildren.\n\n**EDIT:**  My HDL to triglyceride ratio is the perfect 2:1 (or is it 1:2?  Can't remember now) ratio, btw.  That also kinda confused him, because my LDL is high, which, according to him is accompanied by hypertension, high triglycerides and a HDL to trig ratio.  ",

Even then I wouldn't expect that to make up for much more than a couple of weeks difference at most.  In my opinion, one of two things are happening.  One, your glucose is drifting up much higher during the day without you realizing it.  To test this you would have to take two to three measurements a day for a week or two to be certain.  Two, (and this is a little rare) your body just prefers to manufacture that particular type of hemoglobin.  Sure that specific type is only supposed to show up in the presence of higher glucose concentrations, but sometimes erythroblasts(RBC producing cells) can just get stuck.  After all, if the cells are working why change them.  That's what your body thinks anyway.  I grant you that last option is still theoretical to an extent, but I've seen doctors just shrug and rattle off this option as a reasonable occurrence when all else is just not adding up.  Short of getting radiation treatment to rid yourself of these pesky cells, you may just have to accept the fact that A1c measurements are not going to be a perfect benchmark for YOU. It's not a crime to fall outside of the standard deviation.  It's just really good to know what YOUR normal actually is.  In any event, don't sweat the number so much.  Especially if most everything else is improving.",

It is triggered by exposure to blood glucose,  which is why it's a good measurement of blood sugar control over time.  RBCs live for abput 12 weeks. If your blood sugar levels are fairly stable,  your A1c level shouldn't change over time, no matters how long your RBCs live.   But theoretically,  older cells would reflect an unstable blood sugar level.  It wouldn't be a false high, it's just be your normal.

A ketogenic state in the medical world is generally a short step from death (ketoacidosis).  When someone comes in and happily describes their diet as \"ketogenic\" when the doc just yesterday was in the hospital admitting patients who had put themselves into near-fatal ketoacidosis (by diet) ... can you see how it might be awkward at best for the doc?\n\nThen we have nutrition.  Doctors hear many times that nutrition can help with diabetes, but I listened very carefully and went to every lecture and *never once* did anyone discuss that diet could in fact cure Type 2 diabetes.  Not in lectures, and not on rotations.  The fact simply doesn't exist.  As for actual nutritional education, we got somewhere around 8 hours, which is barely enough to cover the basics.  We discussed the Federal dietary guidelines per MyPlate, and had brief discussions of the DASH and Mediterranean diet.  As far as daily diet goes, that was it.\n\nThen we have the active campaigning against a keto diet.  There wasn't much, but there was enough.  Saturated fat is bad for you and cause heart disease.  Animal fats cause atherosclerosis.  All this kind of stuff.\n\nThis last part is why doctors generally aren't going to be on board with keto.  Most keto folks are heavy into animal foods and fats, and it will be a cold day in hell before most doctors recommend a high-fat diet to their patients.  High-fat diets are considered right up there with smoking in terms of danger to your health.  \n\nThat last part explains the response from medical personnel.  You would get a similar response if you said, \"hey doc, I took up smoking and lost all this weight!\"\n\nIn a nutshell, though, it works like this: We are trained to follow guidelines and the guidelines do not allow for treatment with a ketogenic diet.  Therefore, ketogenic diets have no evidence to support them.  Therefore, they cannot be recommended and perhaps should be discouraged.\n\n[Sarah Hallberg's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da1vvigy5tQ) is titled, \"Reversing Type 2 diabetes starts with ignoring the guidelines.\"  In the medical world, the idea of ignoring guidelines is profoundly rebellious.  Medical doctors -- almost without exception -- got to be doctors by demonstrating \"compliance\" in every aspect of their lives.  You will not generally find doctors who will even consider ignoring guidelines.\n\nAnyway, carry on.  Hopefully this is informative.  It was one of my questions going into medical school and I feel like I have a fair answer.",

Once you understand why, then the animal and saturated fat question starts to make a lot more sense.\n\nIn a nutshell, smoking damages the endothelial linings of your blood vessels.  This causes an inflammatory reaction as your body tries to repair the damage (through your whole body, all at once, it's a systemic inflammation to repair vascular damage everywhere).\n\nWhite blood cells collect at the damage and try to repair it.  They secrete IL-6, which turns on HMG CoA in the liver to produce more cholesterol.  Why?  Because cholesterol is sticky and is the \"glue\" your body uses to start repairing flexible tissues like blood vessel walls.  These white blood cells collect the cholesterol and use them as glue, thus the \"foam cells\" we see mentioned in studies of atherosclerosis.  If the damage continues to be inflicted, then the repair never completes and patching gets uglier and uglier and can eventually block the vessel altogether or break off and cause a stroke or some horrible problem.\n\nSo that's smoking.  The thing is, this is a very common mechanism.  Anything that damages the lining of your blood vessels will set it off.  What damages the lining of your blood vessels?  Lots of things, it turns out.\n\n* High blood sugar is quite toxic\n\n* Alcohol\n\n* Smoking (as described)\n\n* Many drugs\n\n* Many disease processes (such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and others)\n\n* Certain foods, such as hydrogenated oils, trans fats, excess omega-6 fatty acids\n\nDifferent fats are different, but many saturated fats simply do not damage the endothelial lining and therefore do not set off the repair cascade.  Animal fats are mostly neutral, plant-based saturated fats like coconut oil are probably beneficial.  Only industrial fats like hydrogenated oils are associated with atherosclerosis and heart disease.\n\n---------\n\nCouple extra points you may find helpful.\n\n(1) Statins lower cholesterol.  Their efficacy in reducing the risk of heart disease is often presented as \"proof\" of the cholesterol theory of heart disease.  However, **statins are also potent IL-6 inhibitors**, and other drugs that inhibit cholesterol (like fibrates and so on) have never been shown to have a clearly beneficial effect on heart disease despite lowering cholesterol.  Cholesterol has never been shown to be anything but a correlative marker for heart disease.  A maker, not a cause.\n\n(2) The cholesterol theory of heart disease is based on feeding high levels of cholesterol to rabbits and causing heart disease.  The only problem with this is that rabbits don't regulate liver production of cholesterol very well.  Feeding them cholesterol gives them *extremely* high levels of cholesterol, more like familial hypercholesterolism.  This *does* cause heart disease, but you have to keep in mind that this is simply not a good model for most humans who have high cholesterol for other reasons .\n\n(3) The research on fats and heart disease almost always conflate industrially-processed fats with healthy fats.  Trans fats are extremely bad, we have known this for 60 years or more.  If you have a study that includes trans fats, *it stands to reason that consumption will be associated with heart disease.*  This should not cast any shadow on healthy fats, however.  Healthy fats function quite differently in the body.  Whenever you look at research, you have to look extremely closely at their specific protocols and the specific fats they used.  Many papers do not describe this very well, so it can be quite hard to tell.\n\nIf you want some citations, I can probably provide them, just say what specifically you have questions about.  I'm mobile right now though.",

I think it's probably very rare that this happens (but would love to hear stories where it has). \n\nEating a low carb diet is more like a cure for a chronic condition. Being able to eat a high carb diet and still have normal blood sugar levels would actually be a cure. :)",

He's basically stating that he is resigned to the fact he will need insulin. \n\n\n I gave my dad a copy of Dr Bernstein\u2019s Diabetes Solution which advocates for super low carb for diabetics but he hasn't read it and continues to eat lots of ice cream etc. He had me in his 40s. He's 75 now. I wish he could spend his latter years not feeling the lethargy/fogginess/etc that high blood sugar brings - not to mention all the health complications. \n\n\nHe sees all the health benefits I'm gaining from keto, and he sees when we eat together that what I can eat is still really delicious.

I have days where I do add some small portions of  complex carbs that I would never eat during my weight loss phase keto if they happen to be something on the menu or whatever (beans, corn, and rarely some additional types of fruit).  And I've relaxed my carb total a bit so if I have a 50 carb day it's not a biggie.   I don't notice any difference. \n\nBut go back to a \"normal\" US diet?  No. Those days are behind me.  Forever.

    "postText": "Hi all!!\n\nI need something cleared up so hoping you guys know the answer to this. \n\nSeeing on some protein bars the carbs are measured. For example 11g of carbs. But then it says also that of those 11g, there\u2019s 9g of alcohols. Does anyone know what exactly this means? And how that affects my overall carb count for the day?\n\nThank you!!",

You also deduct fiber from carbs. \n\nIf something is 10g Carbs, 2g Fiber, and 6g Sugar Alcohols, Net Carbs is 2g. (10-2-6=2).",

    "postText": "[progress pics!](https://imgur.com/gallery/J1PVhwI)\n\nTW: Eating Disorder\n\nFor years I had lied to myself and thought that going to the gym once a week and Eating a salad that day was making me lose weight. I thought that me gorging on 4 burritos and 2 quesadillas every night and then purging after would stop me from gaining any weight. All lies I told myself to try and provide myself happiness. My first 2 years of college I suffered from an eating disorder and gained an astronomical amount of weight (100+ pounds).\n\n*Flash forward to spring 2020*\n\n20 years old on May 18th of 2020, I weighed 527 pounds, and started keto as a joke. When I saw I had lost 20 pounds in a week and a half, I knew this was my shot and I had to take it.\n\nKeto began, started walking a mile a day and now I\u2019m running 6 miles a day and lifting weights, kicked my eating disorder, and now my life has never been better. I can\u2019t believe I let myself get so disgusting and have sworn to never EVER look back.\n\nWeighed in when I took the update picture at 419 pounds! I weigh less than I did my senior year of high school! It hasn\u2019t been easy, and I\u2019ve only had one cheat day on Christmas Day to celebrate losing 100 pounds. Needless to say after the carb side effects I won\u2019t be doing that again for a LONG time haha.\n\nI still have a long ways to go, and I\u2019m trying to lose about 70 more pounds by August in order to walk on to my college\u2019s football team. To some, this may sound impossible, but I now know that anything\u2019s within reach if you just put your mind to it! If anyone has any questions I\u2019m more than happy to answer them! Just wanted to share my update with you all!\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add it but I also do OMAD fasting, every day at 545 PM!\n\nTL;DR Lost 108 pounds in 6 months, beat Eating Disorder",

Don't overdo running or rather, don't ever put too much stress on joints either from too much weight or too much distance.\n\nAt some point the muscles just become autonomous and no matter how tired they feel, there is this tipping point where they sorta become dull and let you run for hours upon hours, not knowing you're doing damage. Then your tendons feel the wear and they don't respond like muscles with lactic acid. Then you'd legs will feel more funny the next morning than they usually do after a good run.",

The elliptical is definitely the best way to do the bulk of your cardio but switch it up and try and all of them each week to build strength in different areas. I stuck to the elliptical religiously and lost a lot of weight but hurt my hip in the process from the repeat motion for a hour a day. Also doing your cardio after your weights will speed things up.",

Go to your primary care doc and tell them that the fold where your stomach hangs is itchy and irritated. In the summer, it gets sweaty and itchy. You will be eligible to have a panniculectomy. \n\nI did this. I lost a significant amount of weight and felt amazing... except for this permanent fanny pack-like flap of skin that would hang under my belly button (the pannis). I'm a full year out from that surgery now and man was it worth it! I only had to pay a few co pays and essentially got a tummy tuck (no muscle tightening though, so not a true tummy tuck), fully covered with my insurance.",

What helped me was realizing that the shame and guilt I felt after binging and purging was nowhere near worth robbing myself of the joy of living a long life. For me it came down to do or die, literally. As much as your support definitely helps, it comes down to himself as an individual and just knowing it\u2019s time to stop. Food is an addiction. But you can always remind him that you\u2019re there for him and encourage him along the way. The more positive reinforcement he feels behind stopping, the more likely he is to stop. I wish you guys nothing but the best of luck and I\u2019ll be praying for you both. My dms are open if you have any more questions",

You absolutely can't be commended enough\n\nSecond, and I know its been said already but this really bears being overstated, **do not run right now!** You're young so you wont be feeling it yet but you are doing irreparable damage to your knees every time you do with that much weight on you. Swimming is excellent, HIIT training on an exercise bicycle is also an excellent option. If neither of those are available to you stick to lifting weights and eating well until you are at a weight more forgiving to your joints.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKCKO!",

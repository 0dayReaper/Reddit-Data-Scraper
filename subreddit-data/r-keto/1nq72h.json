I encourage pub food when I go out (to places I trust and can get a firm answer on ingredients). I eat a lot of hot wings, dry ribs and bunks burgers (holding the appropriate toppings like ketchup) or a protein and grill veg. But I also eat the things I need to balance my fat vs protein intake before I go. I consider the eating out a \"social top up\" when I go out. \n- fast food can be ok in a pinch if need be. Just be carful of hidden sugars, etc. I researched the fast food places in my area prior to the diet, just in case I got \"stuck\" one day. But now that I have been tracking calories, they are pretty much a no go for me. Best to avoid if possible. ",

If it's a burger joint (Red Robin or the local places that are similar) I'll just get the burger lettuce wrapped. If it's Mexican food I'll have the fajitas minus the wraps because it's still delicious!\n\nThe only place I refuse to go with them is an Italian restaurant. Italian food is my downfall; I love it so much! It's also tough to find something keto-friendly at most Italian places.\n\nI don't do fast food anymore; I just skip it completely. That was really tough for the first month or so and sometimes I still crave a few things from one place in particular but it's much easier to drive on by without stopping. I hear some people get fast food burgers or chicken in a lettuce wrap or just without the bun but I couldn't do that; I just don't think it would taste good enough to justify it.",

That was the hardest part. \"When you feel hungry, you're actually just thirsty\" was something someone said that clicked for me. After a month of getting used to keto (and losing around 25 pounds), I started not being very hungry for dinner, so I stopped eating dinner most days. I guess that's called Intermittent Fasting. I still kept tunder 1700 calories a day, just a great breakfast (important), and a lunch of nuts or lunch meat and cheese. Usually, breakfast was 600-800 calories and lunch was 500-700 calories. And I drank water. I chugged it. I poured it warm so I could chug more. I chugged 24 oz every time I had to pee while at work (desk job), which kept me peeing all day.\n\nA month in, we started C25K, jog-walking around our neighborhood. 10 weeks after I started, huffing and puffing and being miserable, we ran our first 5k. I could run 3.1 miles without stopping. It was weird. I've always despised running.\n\nI did not cheat to get to the point I am in the picture. I cheated 2 days after that picture and mostly regretted it. I feel like I'm in a battle against carbs, like carbs are the enemy, daring you to eat them. You know what, carbs? Fuck you. Fuck you and that pot-belly-laden horse you rode in on. I'm not eating you, you motherfucking carb.\nI made sure I got enough fat. I counted my calories every day in MyFitnessPal. I have a Withings scale that tracks my weight in MFP every day so I can see trends and know what works.\n\nI know on days where I work out and get enough water I'll lose weight. On days I don't work out but get enough water, I'll lose a little weight. On days I don't get enough water, I'll gain weight, even if I work out. I know that weight will come off easily once I get enough water again, but seriously, water is important.\n\nGet enough fat (otherwise you won't be able to carry a large calorie deficit). Track and count your calories (and don't cheat in this; you're only cheating yourself). Exercise (anything really, but calorie deficit matters).\n\nGood luck!",

What you're looking for can be found in Chapter 9, Section 3 of Lyle McDonald's The Ketogenic Diet. I'll paraphrase for you. . . .\n\nLyle McDonald suggests .8g/lb for sedentary dieters and .9g/lb for those that are exercising, after the adaptation period, based on total body weight, unless I'm just reading him wrong. If you have an accurate method to determine your lean body mass, you'll want to consume about .5g to .8g per lb of lean body mass in protein, depending on where you fall in the endurance&lt;-&gt;strength training continuum.\n\nIt should be noted that there is the possibility for a fairly wide range of possible numbers here. But, if you're prioritizing for weight loss, I'd recommend sticking with the 65:30:5 ratio for your macros and seeing where the numbers land. If you're doing any lifting, you might want to tend towards more protein, but at least be somewhat conservative at first and see how you're doing after a few weeks. Then start tweaking your diet.\n\nEDIT: 1g of protein = 4 kcal. 1g of fat = 9 kcal. 1g of carbs = 4 kcal. 1g of alcohol = 7 kcal. Roughly speaking, you'll typically want to consume slightly more protein as measured by grams than fat if your macros are at 65:30:5. ",

I've been drinking water the way you describe for about the past ten years.

My two brothers are overweight and obese, but I've never been more than ten-fifteen pounds overweight. Now I can see how constantly pounding water has been a major factor in that. (Plus personal genetics and life choices.)\n\n Thanks for the insight and keep up the great work. I know it's not easy but you guys look great!",

Basically it is a diet that is high fat, moderate protein, and very low carbohydrate. \n\nJust stop eating any starches or sugars and your body will go through a conversion process (this is known as the keto flu) to adapt to use the next easiest fuel sources to use. Since you no longer are supplying your body with quick digesting carbs (which are easily converted to fat), but instead with slower burning protein and much slower burning fat, you no longer feel hungry as often as with a \"traditional\" carb diet, and therefore it is much easier to eat less and lose weight.\n\nSorry that reply was kind of long...",

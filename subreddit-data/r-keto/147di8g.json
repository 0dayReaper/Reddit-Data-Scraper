    "postText": "Thought I'd pass along my fasting story and having to go low carb because of insulin resistance even AFTER 10+ years of 48hrs+ once a week intermittent fasting.\n\nCirca 2013ish I did routine bloodwork and my doc started making \"overweight\", \"prediabetic\", \"triglycerides way too high\" and \"statin\" noises at me.  I'd recently read a study on intermittent fasting so I thought I'd go that route - I've been overweight or borderline almost my entire life and I knew there was no way I was going to be able to stay on a caloric restriction diet for more than 6 months, if that.\n\nTo my surprise it turned out to be dead easy to maintain, when fasting I just don't get hungry after 10:30AM of the first day so thats what I did - without ANY change on my diet.\n\nAnd it worked!  My glucose fasting levels went down to 90ish, triglicerides and hdl/ldl levels down to normal (albeit high normal) and most importantly to me I stopped gaining weight.  Didnt lose much but hey, I'll take the win.\n\nAnd I went on with my life confident that all I had to do was fasting without any other change.\n\n10 years roll by and I notice I'm notice I'm getting temporary mild headaches when I eat something with a lot of carbs like a mega muffin.  It took me a LONG time to correlate the headaches with eating carbs.\n\nDoc orders tests, fasting glucose is at 105, triglicerides, etc are a little better but pretty much the same.  Doc says \"you're normal, thats what the normal fasting glucose level is somebody with a BMI of 30\"  I ask about the carb headaches, he says \"Thats normal too\"\n\nI then proceed to pester the HELL out of him until he orders a fasting insulin test.\n\nWell, crap.  Its 12.4 - absolute max normal is 10, desired is less than 7, most non diabetics hover around 5 or less.  Usually a lot less.\n\nMore tests, and I'm fairly insulin resistant.  I can make enough insulin to keep my glucose mostly under control unless I really whack it hard (mega muffin).  I'm not a diabetic, or even technically a prediabetic.  But I will be one pretty stinking soon if I don't do something.\n\nNutritionist says its probably because 80% of my diet was processed food.  Wife and I just don't cook so almost everything is out of a box or premade or heat-up in the microwave.\n\nHello keto lifestyle...\n\nWell, boogers.  At least I'm dumping weight like mad.",

Its not common, at all.  Had to drive quite a ways to get it done.\n\nHoly snot my pancreas was pouring out insulin to maintain my blood glucose levels.\n\nEdit:  I should have been more specific. The Kraft test is a combination of both a Glucose Tolerance Test and a Insulin Response to Glucose Test. The oral Glucose tolerance test is quite common, the Insulin Response test is very uncommon.",

Gestational diabetes comes suddenly and often resolves immediately after giving birth so testing the A1C isn't accurate for pregnant women. This is why they do the oral glucose test, to see in real time how the body is processing the glucose. They measure blood sugar levels, not insulin levels. \n\n\nMaybe your doctor didn't want to give you this test because it isn't a good test for the average non-pregnant person and it's difficult to justify it to the insurance provider.",

Insulin level is \"out of sight, out of mind\" to them, but it's just as problematic as excess glucose.\n\nSure, insulin \"clears glucose out of the bloodstream\", but not out of the body. It shoves it into your fat cells.\n\nKeto is about not putting all that glucose into your bloodstream to begin with.",

The exact cause of IR isn't fully understood, and some people seem to be more prone to developing it than others, though clearly diet is a major factor. Testing for IR isn't common, most people don't even know they have it till significant damage is done and they are diagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes, by then you've likely had it for decades.   \n\n\nA significant factor in developing it looks to be frequent exposure to high levels of insulin, the more high glycemic index foods you eat the larger the insulin response, the more often you eat during the day, the longer your cells are exposed to elevated levels; much like a heroin addict, increased exposure seems to cause insulin tolerance to increase in a vicious cycle. The more frequently you eat carbs the larger the insulin response, the more insulin in the system the faster the cells become resistant and round and round till finally the pancreas can no longer produce enough to keep blood glucose in check.   \n\n\nThere does seem to be some research that if caught early it may be possible to fully reverse it, though by the time diabetes has developed it may be too late to reverse it fully. Once you have it, anything that can keep insulin levels lower is vitally important to health since IR is now linked to everything from obesity, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, infertility, low testosterone, numerous forms of cancer and even Alzheimer's. Most of the drugs now prescribed for diabetes either do nothing to improve IR or actually make the condition worse; the only effective treatments I've seen are lifestyle based, in particular low carb diets, exercise (especially resistance) and intermittent fasting.",

From the limited clinical trials I've seen it may not be possible to fully reverse severe IR, most diabetics need to maintain a low carb diet though it does appear that some improvements are possible (many people can slightly increase carb consumption over time without spiking glucose). My guess is that even though I've kept my glucose in normal range for going on 2 years now, my insulin resistance is not gone.",

Just eat whole foods that are naturally low carb like meat with vegetables. Keep it simple. I'm sure you'll see great results if you do that!\n\nAnd good job getting your insulin tested.

Lowering carbs. Helping some but. Not as fast as I\u2019d like. But the endocrinologist doesn\u2019t want me to fast or remove carbs. She wants me to follow one of those charts that\u2019s basically the new food period and portion each type of food. Like 4oz of protein, 1 cup of grains, 1/2 non starchy veggies, etc.",

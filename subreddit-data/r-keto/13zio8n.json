    "postText": "I tried to restart keto months ago, and I'm finally been successful this weekend sticking to this way of life. And it's paying off. I'm 3.8 lb away from being in Onederland. I refuse to be and \"I only lost\" person! I started again at 210 lb. My high was 250. I'm so happy to have lost 6.2 pounds since being very serious about my weight loss. Not only that, but bringing down my cholesterol and triglycerides.",

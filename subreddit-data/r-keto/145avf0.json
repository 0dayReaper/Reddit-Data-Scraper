    "postText": "Hello everyone. I'm planning on leaving some beef cut in a marinade throughout the night which includes a can of modelo beer(high in carbs), and then the next day take out of the marinade and cook it on a grill. Could anyone advise what would the estimated amount of carbs that can be transferred into the meat? Please note that I won't add the marinade in the meat while it's cooked it will just be wathever was internally transferred into the meat, which I'm not sure if just flavors are transferred and/or also properties. Highly appreciated!",

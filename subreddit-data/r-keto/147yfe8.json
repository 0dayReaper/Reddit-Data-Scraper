    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m not new to keto, \ufffc been on and off it many times, and I never lose more than like 8 pounds. Did keto for 10 months in pandemic, and thankfully because I would have gained a ton. But didn\u2019t loose much\u2026\ufffc I do feel a lot better on it so all this talk of Mediterranean keto and Keto 2.0, I decided to give it another shot. \ufffc \nI always felt that it was too much fat for me and my genetics in the first place so this makes sense. I don\u2019t process fat well says my dna. \n\nWondering if anyone has a good meal plan or macro ratios for a lower fat keto or any advice. All those days spent in keto groups seeing people change from obese to fit hotties - Happy for them, but was very discouraging to me. I especially don\u2019t understand how they do it with dirty keto and all those chemicals. So, hello and here to get some tips from people who had similar issues but found a way that works. \nI\u2019m 49 F. \n\ufffc",

            "comment": "I manage to do keto without eating a ton of fat. My diet is mostly poultry, fish, lean beef and pork, eggs, tofu, and lots and lots of vegetables.  My treats are mainly berries and yogurt or dark chocolate and nut butter. I don\u2019t like fatty meat or the taste of artificial sweeteners, so I\u2019m not tempted to include them. I love bacon, cheese and nuts but can only eat small portions due to the calories. I do eat the new fangled low carb tortillas and bread because they make sticking to the diet long term easier. It really isn\u2019t hard to do lower fat keto and it doesn\u2019t always have to be a salad or a simple protein with a side or two of vegetables:  soups, curries, stir fries, \u201cpasta\u201d with spaghetti squash, zoodles or heart of palm noodles can all be on the menu. Eat what you like/what you consider healthy. Don\u2019t worry what other people think.",

Muscle tone is the amount of tension a muscle maintains when it's at rest. What most people mean when they say \"toned\" is certain level of muscular definition. Being \"toned\" is simply a matter of having enough muscle mass and low enough body fat.\n\n\n**Do women get bulky if they lift heavy things?**\n\nWhile some things are different for women than they are for men (where your body tends to store fat, how quickly you'll lose body fat, how quickly you'll add muscle, etc.) pretty much everything in this FAQ applies equally to women and men. How to lose body fat, how to add muscle, how to get fit, how to \"tone up\"...the principles are same for both women and men.\n\nSome women are averse to heavy weights because they don't want to \"bulk up\" or \"look like a dude\". However, most women will never get as bulky as guys because they lack sufficient testosterone. The female professional athletes you see with \"toned\" arms are more indicative of what is possible without drugs.",

I would eat them all day and night if I could. \n\nMy go to meals are:\n\nSalads with avocado, cucumber, egg and mayo (and cos lettuce). I like mayo as you can add a huge spoonful in a pack lunch and it mixes up nicely by lunchtime.\n\nSmoked polish sausage with cabbage all fried in butter and chili flakes\n\nRibeye (twice a week). I love resting it on the cutting board with a pat of butter on top before serving.  \n\nCheese burgers in a iceberg lettuce wrap (with ofc mayo and mustard)",

Your results are exemplary, a true demonstration of hard work and commitment.\n\nIf I may offer some advice on fitness to accompany keto: keep up some cardio, but start integrating some strength training.  Women are hesitant to start lifting weights out of fear of \"getting bulky\", but the opposite occurs.  Your muscles get toned, and your body gets more supported by the added musculature.  Plus your keto will have stronger results, as more muscle means a higher calorie-burning baseline.",

    "postText": "Is this normal? I\u2019ve been firmly in ketosis for about 3 weeks now. I went on a 6 mile moderate-to-difficult hike last week, it was about 5 hours with rough terrain, and now even walking a mile at the local park with my dog is harder than it used to be and almost wiped me out. I\u2019ve always been into hiking and have never had this problem before without keto. I brought snacks, lunch, and hydration with me on the hike, I even took a break every 1.5 hours or so. \n\nI\u2019m just trying to figure out what I did wrong. And ideas?",

I now make sure I have additives in my pack with me for during the hike, and a cooler with some in for after.  I also find going a little higher on my carbs than usual post hike, but in the form of veggies, helps me get back to normal quicker.  So, long hike, cold electrolyte drink when I get back to the car, then dinner of something like steak/fish with a large side of brussel sprouts is my go to.",

Also, if you take too much potassium supplement (NoSalt, for example) at one time, it can also cause you to be tired for a few hours. But likely you are too low instead of too high on potassium.\n\nUsually, you have endless energy on keto. You only have to take a hydration break of a few minutes whenever needed. Sodium is part of staying hydrated. Did you have salt in your hydration water? Did you have 5,000 mg of sodium as your base amount, then you *add more* for your exercising?\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso, sometimes just one tablespoon of coconut butter can make the difference.",

    "postText": "So I started Keto last June and I have been working at it full force for just over a year, in that time I have completely redefined how I look and feel, losing 170 lbs. When I started though, I was 607 lbs. so I have a long way to go. Still I think that the weight loss is something to celebrate and it keeps me going. So here's what I look like losing the weight:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/m48VjXu](https://imgur.com/a/m48VjXu)",

            "comment": "Hello sir.  You are still doing damn damn great!!!!   Yes, you do still have a lot of work to do, but I have some thoughts on this.  Since we were once really really big guys, we have a lot of \"stuff\" to unwind.  Mental habits to unwind.  One example of that would be eating until we are stuffed and can't poke another bite of food down our throats.  Simply put, this is how we ate.  It is one of the ways that allowed us to reach those hallowed 600 pound grounds.  If you stop and think about it, we have a ton of these habits that we must rid ourselves.       \n\nBecause this weight loss thing takes so much time and effort, we are given the chance to reprogram our minds.  Stop eating when we are not hungry vs. old the way.  Learning that food is just fuel vs. every meal being a \"feast\".  It takes time to unlearn these lifelong habits so that when we reach our stopping points, we are simply people who think about food in a \"regular\" way vs. our fat people way.  I hope all of the above makes sense.        \n\nAnother thing is that by the process being arduous, we learn to respect how difficult it is to lose weight.  Let's face it, gaining weight is damn easy.  Losing weight is damn hard.  It needs to be hard for us so that we learn to respect the process and in turn, we learn to respect ourselves.      \n\nThat is a bigger victory than all other victories.  Learning to respect ourselves.                      \n\nYOU are going to lose 357 pounds.   By doing so, you will prove to people that once they get overweight, their life is not over.  This will inspire other people.  As this happens, you will leave a legacy that extends far beyond the actual weight loss.  Simply put, you will have a legacy of hope.         \n\nSo my friend, as you look towards the future, do not look at the time it will take.  Instead, look at the trail you are blazing.  It is a trail that gives YOU a new life.  It is a trail that gives others hope.",

You are literally adding years and quality to your life.\n\nMy weight loss slowed down to about a pound/week at the moment and I have about 40 pounds to go and I find myself complaining and being negative about it. Thanks for reminding me it's just part of the journey and that I have nothing to worry about. \n\n\\-From a fellow Keto'er in Scotland",

Here's one way to think of it.  The amount of weight you've lost is like a whole healthy man.  You're carrying around one few man than you did before.  I'm sure you're aware that there are about two whole men to go, but you've lost more in the past year or so, many of us will lose, even when we reach a healthy weight.\n\nYou are to be commended: Someday you'll see the old pictures of yourself, and be glad you lost it.  You'll look back at the XXXXL clothing you had and think it looks like a tent.  You'll run into people and they won't recognize you.  You'll show your ID, and people may doubt you because you'll look nothing like a huge face in the photo.\n\nKCKO",

I was bowled over when someone said to me, can you imagine how difficult it is to defeat a food addiction vs a chemical addiction, in that, the drug addict can eliminate the substance entirely but the food addict still has to consume,yet regulate,their intake of their drug (food) of choice. I am in awe of your success, sir.",

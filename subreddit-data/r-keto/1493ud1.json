There is information on keto flu in the FAQ\n\nKeto is low on magnesium, I take a supplement at night as it's clinicaly proven to aid in sleep and reduce anxiety and overall stress. \n\nIt's also worth noting that any medications you take (and their potential side effects) may be more influential on your body. Lowering doses of some medications, under the guidance of your doctor, can help with the occurrence of side effects or the dose, over all, being a little strong for your new metabolism.",

The only carbs I\u2019m ingesting are vegetables and I\u2019m making sure to stay well under 20g a day (I\u2019m usually in the 10g area). I\u2019m adding my foods into a tracker and I\u2019m usually just under my goals for fat and protein, both are set in the 90s and I\u2019m usually hitting 70-90g a day. My calorie goal is 1168 per a macro calculator and I\u2019m usually right around there. I am struggling to eat as this diet is very satiating.\n\nI start my day with a coffee, blob of coconut cream and a splash of MCT. \n\nI\u2019m doing my best to drink lots of water and I take electrolytes everyday. \n\nThe scale literally has not budged at all and I\u2019m getting a little bummed out. I\u2019m feeling mentally better but there\u2019s been no changes in weight, measurements or otherwise. I have no idea what I\u2019m doing wrong. I\u2019ve read through dozens of posts and it feels like I need to go harder on the fats maybe but I\u2019m kind of clueless what to do.",

You can really hurt your body eating so little for too long.\n2. protein is a goal; fat is just there for satiety. You do want to hit your protein goal every day.\n3. Consider bathroom habits - if you're stopped up at all, that can cause the scale to not move for a while.\n4. Whenever you start trying to lose weight, your body will hang onto every ounce as fiercly as it can - that's how it's built to survive. You just keep on keepin' on &amp; it eventually comes. \n5. Consider rotating higher and lower calorie days to keep your metabolism from lowering.\n\nA lot of times with this thing it's like...scale doesn't budge doesn't budge doesn't budge...then you finally get a bit of a \"whoosh\" and then you don't budge again, repeat, repeat",

I\u2019m small and lazy and I\u2019m not sure if I ate more calories I would lose weight. You state it\u2019s too low and dangerous - what do you feel is healthy?

Perhaps I was expecting quick results based on the many accounts of people dropping weight within days/weeks.

Nonetheless, I feel it would be good to incorporate more fresh fruits, milk, potatoes, and whole grains into my diet while staying predominately ~keto.\n\nI wonder if anyone has experience with that? I imagine sticking to clean keto for 4 days per week while adding ~1 not-at-all-keto meal (think of fruit salad, potatoes, or sandwich) on others and offsetting additional carb consumption with ~1h cardio workouts.",

You start adding fruits and other carbs and get a little toooo relaxed , all of a sudden you spiral into \u201coh, a piece of cake won\u2019t hurt anymore\u201d and slowly introduce more and more of the shitty habits again more frequently.\n\nAlthough, anecdotally, I\u2019d say it\u2019s totally possible to maintain your health with healthy foods like fruits and whatnot. When I was hitting the gym like a mad lad and keeping most of my diet to whole foods, I easily kept losing weight. I even had cheat days where my friend and I would buy an egregious amount of McDonald\u2019s and alcohol once a week at times. Just a matter of keeping those cheat days or extra carbs in check in some way (my cheat meals would be my only meal that day as a rule)",

(We took pics so I could really see it.) I stopped looking at the scale while lifting as hard as I was. Then took up running... I was eating a ton (like 3,000 calories - was marathon training and lifting), because I could. My body found itself comfy at \\~140, and I stayed there for years.\n\nThen a lot of high-stress high-demand life took over (kiddo w/ disabilities, sibling rivalry, my own trauma stuff), I started using medicinal marijuana, stopped lifting and running, the rest is history.\n\nI'm hopeful that once I get back to 135-140ish I can try to return to my maintenance ways.

    "postText": "I originally posted this in the beginners keto thread but I am not getting any responses so I will try it in the r/keto thread and hope for some responses. \n\nI\u2019ve been following keto, perhaps closer to carnivore for two months now.\n I worked hard to get my electrolytes in balance as I was dealing with keto flu symptoms. I have been having major foot and leg cramps every night and they hit almost hourly from about 11:30 pm on. I drink tonic water for the quinine for the leg cramps. I\u2019m getting 3,000 to 5,000 mg sodium daily, 1,200 mg potassium and 425 magnesium malate. I think those numbers are close. The cramps seem to be getting worse and I just don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve lost 12 pounds so far and I am happy with that. I don\u2019t want to have to give up this way of eating. I am eating mostly beef seasoned with Real salt and eggs fried in butter, with occasional chicken, pork and cheese. I\u2019m kind of out of ideas regarding the cramping so I\u2019d appreciate any ideas you might have. Thank you.",

I originally tried it for joint pain...it helps with migraine also.\nThis is just my experience...others may have different advice.",

First, make sure you\u2019re getting enough protein and second, make sure you\u2019re not eating too much salt. \n\nMy advice? Eat a vegetable or start taking a multi-vitamin. Keto isn\u2019t magic, your body still needs other things to function. Frankly, my suspicion is your salt intake is too high (remember your food has salt in it, be careful there when you supplement) and your fluid intake is too low. Dehydration is the most common cause of cramps without any other apparent etiology. \n\nedit: TIL that they put quinine in tonic water commercially\u2026not sure what that will do for your cramps though. It\u2019s approved medically as only an anti-malarial and it\u2019s specifically labeled to not be prescribed for cramps.",

Not enough water or too much caffeine can be dehydrating and you can get cramps... but if you are having them that often you may want to see a doctor (i get them from overuse and because i have some spinal stenosis).  Other things: don't overdo potassium. I don't see calcium or zinc listed. Probably should balance your minerals.  When they do occur you might get some relief with heat or cold, CBD oil (works for me mostly).",

And I'm surprised if you have leg cramps and stenosis they didn't mention it. It can also cause tingling, numbness and bladder issues (if its lumbar due to nerve compression).. anyway still if you know you have stenosis you might want to make sure it's not contributing /worsening (it may or may not depending). Anyway aside from that I'm  proponent for food sources vs supplements. You might consider adding in fatty fish (salmon, cod, mackerel, halibut, sardines) into your diet. Also avocado (if you don't like it plain you can make guacamole or buy it.  I recommend Wholly Guacamole as I struggle with portions and guac). I make a trail mix of one Brazil, some of the following pumpkin seeds, almonds, pecans, walnuts and package into snack bags so I know how many carbs. I also eat seaweed snacks for iodine, etc. This provides a variety of minerals that we miss.  Additionally you might consider getting some leafy greens (not iceberg lettuce get better lettuce, kale, etc). I rotate these choices to fit in carbs so I get the variety but not necessarily the same day. Hopefully your leg stops cramping up so much, I know they can be so painful.",

Be sure you are eating enough and salting your food. Drink  plenty of fluids. I mix this at night and have not had any spasms or cramps since.",

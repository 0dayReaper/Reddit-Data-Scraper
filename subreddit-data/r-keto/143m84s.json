    "postText": "Just started keto a couple of weeks ago. Thankfully, there was very little keto flu. I'm finding however that I seem to be sensitive to some fats. Getting some pretty bad indigestion after eating ribs, bacon, 85/15 hamburgers to name a few things. Is this normal? Was wondering if it was just rendered/cooked fats or not. Full fat yogurt, cheese or heavy whipping cream doesn't seem to bother me. Small amounts of butter when cooking eggs seem to be okay, but much more than about 3/4 Tbsp in the pan pushes it. Doing a little experimentation to see how things affect me. Has anyone else experienced similar issues and if so, did it eventually get to where you were more tolerant of fatty meats and such? Thanks!",

Wanted a clean way to try and lose some excess weight and turn around the type 2 diabetes symptoms and Keto seemed to be the way. Right now I am definitely eating more protein than fat, keeping carbs under 20g a day and things seem to be working. Just wanted to ensure that I kept things moving and thought that more dietary fat was the next logical step.  Thank you for sharing your experience with it!",

I didn't really realise quite how calorie dense some things were till the numbers were in front of me. I'd say that increased fat consumption did have a horrible laxative effect for a while, but, like you've probably seen with your app, you don't need that much. If fatty meat is a trigger, see if other sources work OK for you. Pecans/walnuts/almonds are good for that..\nFull of fat, lowish carbs.\n\nMy calorie intake is supposed to be 2200. I hit that some days, and others 1200 is enough. Keto is great sometimes. Nice to not always be a slave to the fridge.",

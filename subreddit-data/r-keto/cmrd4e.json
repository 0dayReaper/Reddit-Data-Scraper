    "postText": "[Before And After Picture (438 lbs to 238 lbs)](https://imgur.com/gallery/j75bxFC)\n\nThis week I have weighed in at 238 LBS, which officially puts me at a total loss of exactly 200 pounds! A lot of hard work and dedication has led me to where I am today, and although I\u2019m still not finished my journey (~ 20-30ish pounds to lose) I am truly grateful and proud of what I have been able to accomplish up to this point, and for how much my life has improved as this journey has gone on. \n\nAfter doing Keto and any other diet technique, one thing I have continued to stick with, as mentioned in my [initial update](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/bxievh/weight_loss_update_438_lbs_to_260_lbs_180_pounds/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app); is IF/OMAD (Intermittent Fasting/One Meal A Day) while keeping CICO in mind (Calories In Calories Out). In terms of exercise, I was doing a 5 day ULPPL (Upper Lower Push Pull Legs) Bodybuilding Routine alongside post-lifting cardio, usually HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training), on at least 3 of those days. Also, I try to remain active and ideally get some form of cardio in through sports or whatever else I can on my rest days. And this is all done in a fasted state to help burn calories/fat more efficiently and boost metabolism etc. \n\nI have faced plenty of adversity during this journey, though have nonetheless stayed relentless in achieving my goals. The love and support I have received from this community in my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/bxievh/weight_loss_update_438_lbs_to_260_lbs_180_pounds/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app) has definitely helped push me to work that much harder and something I will never take for granted. \n\nI really want to set an example for how much power we all have within us, whether it\u2019s related to weight loss or not; we all have the potential to accomplish such great things that often isn\u2019t realized. Whatever it is you desire to accomplish, whether it\u2019s losing/gaining weight or whatever else, please remember how much YOU yourself are capable of, and to never sell yourself short. Realize your potential and realize it is never too late to make a change or better yourself. \n\nI\u2018ve constantly been trying to lose weight practically my whole life, since I was just a child, and the best decision I made was to never give up. Now here I am today, not at the end of my journey, but several steps ahead of where I was when I started and constantly pushing forward. Will be updating you guys again once I reach my final goal weight (~ 20-30ish lbs away), until then wishing the best to each and every one of you in your journeys, stay blessed! \ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f",

Worst part was the swelling but that was gone after about a week. If you have the money, don't hesitate to get rid of the loose skin. You can expect the scars to fade in 2-3 years. Don't worry about the physical pain, it seems like your really resilient, so you will manage well. The only downside is not being able to do weights for 3 months, when I did go back to the gym, I could manage 80% what I could before.",

Although, I will tell you I am infinity times happier now with my body than i was before, be proud of any loose skin you get, it symbolizes the sacrifice and hard work you put in! And if you feel like getting rid of it which is completely fine to do, then loose skin removal surgery is also an option! Just please don\u2019t let loose skin scare you away from living a healthier lifestyle and dropping that weight, trust me it is worth it! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude05",

I don\u2019t have nearly as much to lose so thanks for sharing and the motivation it gives me to kick myself into gear.\n\nBtw I noticed in your before pic you had a slight case of genu valgum (aka knock knees) which I also currently deal with probably cause of the weight. But in the after pic it\u2019s either not as noticeable or it\u2019s gone. I was just curious about that and whether you actually got it corrected.",

I'm frustrated that my doctor didn't think to tell me about trying Keto as much as I have struggled with my weight and how physically uncomfortable it was to get dressed and just walk. I found Keto from face book. Seeing others achievements and researching it etc.. I too finally am so comfortable, so healthy and feeling so damn good!! I celebrate you, me and everyone who is healthy minded and sharing their success stories!! After having cancer in 2009 (I've celebrated being cancer free 10 yrs this month) it just simply boggles my mind (as I have seen many doctors) especially now for follow ups that not one doctor mentioned Keto to help me! I'm so thankful for communities like this one.",

I assume you just ate one meal a day with something like 1000 calories? Did you eat anything specific in there? What did your cheat days look like if any?",

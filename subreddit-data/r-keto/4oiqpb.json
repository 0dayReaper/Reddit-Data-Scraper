I, too, started close to his weight and I'm near his end weight and I would claim I've barely changed. \n\nNever mind my pants now officially don't work without belts and some of my belts need new holes... I still see that chub in the chest and stomach and it feels like it hasn't changed at all. All that logical evidence has little to do with my belief system. Omg. Now keto taught me what religious people feel. Dare I say miracle?!",

You still can have a bunch of amazing food, but you just get strict about your sugars and carbs, and it actually changes the way your body processes fat.  \n\nFor example, yesterday I had NY Strip steak for dinner with a side of steamed broccoli and a garden salad.  For lunch I had a chicken Caeser salad.  For breakfast a bacon and cheddar omelette.  \n\nThe night before I had two big cheese-stuffed, bacon wrapped chicken breasts for dinner and a (lettuce wrapped) double cheeseburger for lunch.  \n\nI eat like this every day, just tracking my carbs and sugars and making sure I'm somewhere around my suggested calorie intake (about 1800 calories for me).  I've lost 11 pounds in the last three weeks. I'm always full, every meal is delicious, I'm getting into great shape, and I have energy all day every day.  \n\nDefinitely look into this! Just drink *lots* of water!",

In fact I'd say I feel like I'm full all the time on Keto while losing weight and hungry all the time off Keto when gaining weight.  What's difficult about Keto is that you need to prepare - you need to shop constantly and have Keto-friendly food in your house and Keto-friendly food prepared with you when you go someplace else.  It's very hard to always have a Keto-friendly food choice on hand.  ",

I know the principle behind ketosis (med student) and Ive been lurking here wanting to try it out soon. Since you are on the diet right now, I just have 3 questions for you:\n\n1. How do you keep track of your metabolic state? If for some reason theres an insulin release then all that fat would be stored away! Is there a way to make sure that you are in ketosis?\n\n2. Whats the rule about alcohol? Can I at least consume once/twice a week?\n\n3. I know its amazing if you wanna lose fat and get fit, but what about other aspects of your health? Did you find that your sleep or digestive system was affected in any way? Any difference in mental energy/alleviation of depression etc? \n\nI know that theres a lot of stuff I can read to answer these questions, but I wanted to hear people's personal experience. Actually, everybody feel free to share your experiences ! Thank you!",

If for some reason theres an insulin release then all that fat would be stored away! Is there a way to make sure that you are in ketosis?\n\nI use keto strips every other day to make sure that there are ketones present in my urine.  But I can kind of tell based on a filmy urine, slight metal taste in my saliva, and after a work out my sweat has a vague metal scent to it as well.  \n\nI'm also very strict about 20g or fewer of carbs a day, which pretty much guarantees ketosis.  \n\n&gt;Whats the rule about alcohol? Can I at least consume once/twice a week?\n\nIf it fits into your macros sure.  I switched over to a vodka tonic on keto, but I pretty quickly stopped drinking because the hangovers are a lot stronger.  But in general, once a week of moderate drinking is fine. You may notice you get drunk a lot faster.  I would just stay away from full calorie beer and tequila.  Multiple glasses of wine is also a no go.  \n\n&gt;I know its amazing if you wanna lose fat and get fit, but what about other aspects of your health? Did you find that your sleep or digestive system was affected in any way? Any difference in mental energy/alleviation of depression etc? \n\nA *lot* more consistent energy. I wake up the first time my alarm goes off now bright eyed and bushy tailed.  I have energy throughout my day.  This is the thing that keeps me going, since I know \"cheating\" just puts me into a total energy slump.  \n\nI've also noticed I'm a lot 'sharper.' Making quicker judgment calls, my wit's a little faster. That sort of thing.  I feel a lot more like I'm functioning the way people are meant to function, you know?  I saw it described once as it being like a mental cold you didn't know you had clearing up.  \n\nFor my digestive system, I used to have insane stomach irritation in the mornings and absolutely could not eat breakfast without feeling nauseous.  After a few days of keto, I tried again and have had no issues whatsoever.  The only thing I've noticed is a smaller bm.  I suggest getting some extra fiber to stay regular, or that could be an issue as well.  \n\n",

If you eat less than 25-30g of carb per day, you will stay in ketosis. Simple as that. No need to fret. If you go over, just keep going and you'll be back in soon enough. The saying around here is keep calm and keto on (at least it used to be).\n\n2. Watch your carbs with beer and mixers. Also, your tolerance will be ruined. Just make the calories fit, and you should be fine.\n\n3. I haven't noticed much of a difference with sleep. My, uhh, movements, have changed. I deuce far less often, but I suppose that can be explained by having far less waste, since I'm eating less, and most of what I eat is protein and fats which your body can use almost entirely, rather than grains which mostly gets passed through. As far as mental energy, I think it's great. A lot of people report a mental clarity after a few days, and I notice the same thing.",

I feel like you should know this but i wouldnt be surprised if they didnt teach med students properly in nutrition.\n\nInsulin is released (generally) due to an increase in blood sugar levels and signals the cells to take in glucose from the blood. If your liver and muscles have stored the max amount of glycogen and theres no immediate need for the rest of the glucose, it is stored as fat",

Insulin release DOES occur only when theres increase in blood glucose; nothing else is a significant stimulus for insulin release in the body. \n\nInsulin however DOES have a considerable effect on fat metabolism, mainly by inhibiting fat breakdown in fat cells, and increases conversion of fatty acids to triglycerides in fat cells. \n[Heres a wikipedia article on physiological effects of insulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin#Physiological_effects)\n\n&gt;Increased lipid synthesis \u2013 insulin forces fat cells to take in blood glucose, which is converted into triglycerides; lack of insulin causes the reverse.[54]\n\n&gt;Increased esterification of fatty acids \u2013 forces adipose tissue to make neutral fats (i.e., triglycerides) from fatty acids; lack of insulin causes the reverse.\n\n&gt;Decreased lipolysis \u2013 forces reduction in conversion of fat cell lipid stores into blood fatty acids and glycerol; lack of insulin causes the reverse.\n\nThis essentially means that, if insulin is released then it would decrease the process of fat breakdown which reduces ketogenesis in the liver. This however most likely wont happen in keto diet due to such a low intake of carbohydrates; but since ketogenesis is affected by hormone levels to some extent, I wanted to know if there is a way to find out whether our body is in ketogenesis state or not!",

I know I love people's progress pics so thought I'd share mine :)\n\nEdit: tons of people are asking so I will clarify, I've been Keto for just over 4 months. I have been VERY strict! This picture is from about 10 months ago and I got a little heavier before I started Keto. \nI keep my carbs sub 20g every day... most days I'm much lower than that. I hit around 1500 cal max until I started to see the weight fall off and now I just eat when I'm hungry and walk a lot :)\nAny more questions then just ask\n\nEdit 2: I'm 175cm and was around 224 lbs at my heaviest... I'm now down to around 196 lbs... hoping to get to 175ish",

We get fiber from low carb veggies like spinach, cauliflower, avocado, broccoli, etc. Some people still use supplements to increase fiber, but that can happen with a lot of diets/life styles. It may see daunting at first, but once I kept my carbs that low, my cravings were significantly diminished. ",

Once you read that (read the FAQ more than once), you'll know pretty much everything you need to know to get started. Under \"Useful Links\" lower in the sidebar, you'll need to use the \"Keto Calculator for Macros.\" Be sure to set it to \"sedentary.\" It will tell you how much protein you must consume (so you don't lose muscle mass), as well as how much fat you're allowed to consume (you don't have to eat all that fat but the more fat you eat, the more satisfied and full you'll feel). Carbs will be under 20, although some people here go up to 25. I believe you should stick to 20 and once you're losing and in ketosis, you can see if having more carbs revs up your appetite. \n\nWe eat less carbs to lessen our appetite (and to feel much better...less foggy, less out of control, less depressed, etc.) but calories are still very important if your goal is to lose weight. \n\nFoods can have zero carbs but sometimes restaurants will add carbs. For instance, chicken has zero carbs, but if it's dipped in batter before fried, then it will have carbs. \n\nI eat eggs, cheese, chicken, chicken broth, beef, fish, occasional bacon, and pork for my proteins. I don't eat nuts because I can't control myself with them and they do have carbs. \n\nFor veggies, I stick to spinach, cauliflower, broccoli and mushrooms. There are lots of recipes and fantastic websites, as well as youtube videos, but keep in mind that there's also a world of misinformation out there. The info here on /r/keto is the most accurate I've seen. \n\n",

Once you start logging your calories, it becomes second nature, much like brushing your teeth. It probably takes a total of 5 minutes out of my day, but it keeps me focused and accountable. \n\nRegarding 2200 calories, try that out for a while and see how it works. Remember that these are just averages/calculations for the masses and you might find that you're not losing much or not as fast as you'd like on that amount so if you see that happening, don't despair...just drop the calories a bit lower. \n\nFinally, I'd like to mention that in the first week or two, I didn't even count calories...only carbs. The goal is to break away from the addiction to carbs. Once that happens, you'll find that you might even have a hard time eating so many calories. Most importantly, be sure to supplement your electrolytes.  For Potassium, I use LoSalt (amazon carries it) because any supplements you buy will not get you anywhere near the amount of potassium you'll need. For salt, I like Himalayan pink salt and for magnesium, I like Natural Calm. You didn't ask, but I'm feeling chatty, so I'll also mention that I absolutely recommend BioKult probiotics. ",

I started a Keto/low carb rotation, hit it hard the first month and loved the results but it was a hard month. \n\nI think learning what's actually in the food we eat and relearning how to eat are what make it difficult. After that month I've been alternating between low carb and Keto mainly due to the fact I love having beers so low carb months I treat myself to some nice beers a few times a week.\n\nI wish I took a before photo in December but honestly didn't think I would be able to stick it. I think the fact you can get knocked out of Ketosis was motivation not to have cheat meals which is what I needed. \n\nKeep at it man!",

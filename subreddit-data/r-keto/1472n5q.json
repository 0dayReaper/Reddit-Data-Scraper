    "postText": "I have now completed eight weeks of dieting with a fair amount of success, and as I track rather a lot of things during the diet I can show some data on the method and effects the diet has had.\n\nI\u2019m Male, 48 years old, 194 cm, starting weight 122 kg (269 lbs), current weight 106.9 kg (235.7 lbs) which is a loss of 15.1kg (33.3 lbs).\n\nIn the first four weeks I reported 9.9kg / 21.8 lbs reduction. So in the second month I have reduced by a further 5.2kg / 11.5 lbs.\n\nMy diet consists almost entirely of whole foods. I have a target daily carb limit of 20 net (which I typically exceed slightly). I have no dietary restrictions, allergies etc. I avoid seed oils by choice.\n\nI\u2019m in good health with no diagnosed ailments and I exercise regularly (a few hours per week).\n\nMost days I\u2019m OMAD with a fasting duration between 15 and 28 hours. Some days I have a snack midday and then an evening meal. I never eat more than twice in a day.\n\nWeekly totals of Calories, Macros, Minerals and Exercise are shown in this table: [https://imgur.com/XMSeVdc](https://imgur.com/XMSeVdc)\n\nOver the last four weeks of the diet I have consumed 949g of carbohydrate gross. Nett Carbs would be about 25% less at 660g. A categorisation of the carbs is shown here: [https://imgur.com/p3STzkt](https://imgur.com/p3STzkt)\n\nWith all of that being said, here are the gains made over the eight weeks:\n\n\u2022 15.1kg / 33.3lbs total reduction in weight.\n\n\u2022 Body measurements greatly reduced: [https://imgur.com/ypyPyHN](https://imgur.com/ypyPyHN)\n\n\u2022 BMI reduced from 31.9 to 28.0 (-3.9).\n\n\u2022 Body fat reduced by 6.3%. Muscle Mass increased by 3.4%: [https://imgur.com/eqWii1K](https://imgur.com/eqWii1K)\n\n\u2022 Visceral Fat score reduced from 14 to 10 (9 is considered healthy).\n\n\u2022 Blood Pressure reduced from Pre Hypertensive 133/77 to an Ideal 107/63. Resting Pulse reduced from 65 to 55 (avg): [https://imgur.com/qyPPlMz](https://imgur.com/qyPPlMz)\n\n\u2022 Blood Glucose reduced from 9.6 to 6.5 (can't mention the unit as reddit will auto delete the post!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is my total exercise in calories burned and type sorted by week, as you can see the most recent week has been a very significant increase and I put this additional capacity down to becoming properly adapted to ketosis, and becoming progressively fitter.  [https://imgur.com/jBzNDRm](https://imgur.com/jBzNDRm)\n\nBody weight in kg and body dimensions in cm over the eight weeks: [https://imgur.com/3r23WYt](https://imgur.com/3r23WYt)\n\nCumulative weight loss measured per week and cumulatively: [https://imgur.com/NTcnPXO](https://imgur.com/NTcnPXO)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther non-scale wins across the duration of the diet would be:\n\n\u2022\tAcid reflux went away within 36 hours of starting the diet.\n\n\u2022\tI\u2019m fitter as a result of the exercise and I\u2019m getting a lot more sun thanks to the cycling. I was exercising moderately while not doing keto and still gaining weight.\n\n\u2022\tOne bowel movement per day is a real time saver.\n\n\u2022\tBefore starting the diet I was experiencing very low energy, this is now no longer a problem.\n\n\u2022\tSleep quality is excellent and snoring has reduced hugely, but it\u2019s still there on occasion.\n\n\u2022\tHunger is completely under control.\n\n\u2022\tVarious inflamed / sore areas such a ribs and elbows have been greatly alleviated.\n\n\u2022\tMood is very much improved. Mental clarity is sharper and clearer.\n\nI know this is a bit of a long post, but as I have all of this information tracked I assumed it would be of interest to a few who like to poke around in the details.\n\nIf anyone has a question, I will answer it as best I can.",

            "comment": "I thought it would be lame to make the same kind of post about my progress. But I'm bored as fuck, and can't sleep. \n\nI started my keto diet 2 months ago. The transformation on my body was insane with in the first month. I could not believe it. I went very hard core the first month, and not so much the second month. Second month had more cheat days because my wife peer pressures with sweets/carbs, like a dealer peddling crack cocaine in the ghettos. She is a terrible influence. Now, I'm planning on going back to hardcore on month three.\n\nI started at 255 pounds, And currently holding at 232. And pretty sure I probably gained some muscle due to having more energy and working more around the house. We have recently be renovating, and I've been running around trying to manage all the work being done and buying supplies for the builders.  \n\nThe results me and you have are pretty much the same. My weight dropped, my gut is pretty much gone, blood pressure normalized. I'm sleeping better. Less snoring, down the line. \n\nI don't count calories like you do. I didn't even step on the scale until I read your post. I eat when I'm hungry. I snack when I feel like I want to snack. But only with approved foods. Especially on the first month. \n\nI did a shit ton of research before I Started the diet, and downloaded a few book PDFs. That this sub recommended to get a grasp of what I was in for, with this diet. My family has had a lot of success in doing it. But fuck, pizza is a hell of a drug. \n\nNow? I'm so motivated by the fast success, I don't even want to look at pizza or anything I know is full of carbs. You really become obsessed with what you can and can't eat. It almost becomes a game. The first month, the amount of reading I did was on another level. \n\nEvery time I went to the market, it was GOOGLE &gt; Search  Reddit keto \\_FOOD\\_ if the food was okay or not. The product was a scam or not. And sure enough, every single god damn food in the world is on this sub and fully discussed if you can eat it or not. Pure comedy. \n\nI know a lot of people struggle with this diet because it's consider and expensive diet. I think those people are abs wrong. The amount of money I was spending on a monthly basis eating out and ordering in HAS to be more than buying from the markets and cooking at home. \n\nThe worst thing about this diet hands down, is the bread situation. Every single food you can go out and eat, requires bread to some degree. Burgers, burritos, pizza, pasta, tacos. All the best stuff. Sushi is gone, Chinese is gone, foods you thought were healthy. Are a huge no no in the keto world. And this is why I never started the diet in the first place. But Now that i'm two months deep. I can seriously live without all that stuff. Steak, chicken, suger-free drinks, suger-free pudding, suger-free jello. Almonds. Bacon, eggs, cheese. Yea dude, that's all seriously doable stuff and it wasn't even that big of a struggle. The suger free stuff really is not that bad at all. \n\nTo the people that think you have to make charts, graphs, count every calorie. You seriously don't need to. Just stop the carbs, stop the sugars. And you're going to lose crap tons of weight, period.",

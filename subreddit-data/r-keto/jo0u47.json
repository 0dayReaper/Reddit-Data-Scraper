My advice would be to work on moderation when you get to your goal weight, and be really conscious not to fall off the wagon too hard. \n\nWhen it was working best for me, I would tend to allow myself one meal a month that was non-keto. That fits with the holiday meals, so I was able to sustain things socially. But I have to get back on the wagon IMMEDIATELY and not let that open the flood gates for a weekend of treats. It helps if this is planned in advance, because it's easy to get into the habit of finding reasons to stray from this WOE. There's always something going on, and even though I don't even find movie popcorn that great, after years of keto, it feels a little deprivating while everyone else is snacking on treats for every single little occasion.\n\nI tend to stick to keto for months and then I have a few days of falling off the wagon (say from Halloween or Christmas) and it's disastrous. If I fall off for more than a day, I end up gaining a LOT. And it's not so easy to lose anymore. I think it's mostly due to my age now (40+). \n\nSo get to your goal weight and then stabilize and find a way you can manage a consistent way of eating in the long-term. And weigh and measure yourself at least once a week, or wear constricting clothing so you'll notice any little gains. Living in Lululemons can be very deceiving and the weight can creep up so easily!\n\nFor me, keto (or at least lazy keto) is the only thing that doesn't send me scarfing things down like Cookie Monster. I'm a sugar addict, through and through. I did slow carb for about a month, and lost a few pounds and enjoyed it. But I found that the no-holds-barred cheat day was a major trigger for disordered eating, so I always return to keto. \n\nPay attention to your triggers, have plans in place, and if you are going to indulge, don't go wild with it. Keto is great, but it's not a miracle for weight loss once your body gets used to it. \n\nEdited to add: that's why I didn't have a single Halloween candy. It's a slippery slope (for me). And one or two days off the wagon can undo literally MONTHS of progress for me. I fell off the wagon for a couple weeks a couple months into the pandemic. And I gained at least 15 pounds, on top of the pounds I had already gained from Christmas. I was up a total of 30 pounds and it's taken several months to lose 5 of those. I'm currently on a fat fast to try and lose some of it, as eating keto and intermittent fasting consistently for months without losing weight is very disheartening, which leads to me before more prone to fall off the wagon. \n\nIf you're young, it's not as hard. This is part of why I feel keto isn't fully sustainable for a lifetime. It's socially very challenging, and I find that most of the time, the way I'm best able to stick to keto is to completely avoid dinner parties and holiday celebrations. But that's not healthy. So get to your goal weight and work on finding a balance and a game plan to immediately get back on track after ONE meal, not after 3 days of carb loading. I think my eating is pretty disordered, so this might not apply to everyone.",

My household has a bowl and bag of mini KitKats, snickers, Hershey etc but it doesn\u2019t appeal to me. The only chocolate that I semi like are peanut m&amp;ms but I don\u2019t go out of my way to buy them. I do have 60% ghiradelli dark chocolate squares if I really need a chocolate fix and with 5 net carbs and 50 calories, it\u2019s not terrible although small size",

I mean it\u2019s theirs, but they\u2019re little and I really don\u2019t want them to eat it too much of it. I really believe sugar is a mild poison and very addictive. And the pull of it for me is essentially like that of a drug addict. My wife in the other hand, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s eaten one piece. I think I might have them pick some of their favorites out and maybe donate or throw out the rest. Hate to do that, but it\u2019s already tripped me up twice now.",

This year numbers were down and towards the end of the night kids were getting double, double handfuls. 20-30 candy bars.  Everyone bought decent-sized candy bars, not the 450 counts for $20.  Typically, we drink around the fire pits. I stayed away from that too!\n\nKids thought we were drunk and were pretty happy.",

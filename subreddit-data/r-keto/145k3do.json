    "postText": "I started keto for the first time about 8 months ago.  I usually do it one month on, one month off.  Despite the interruptions, I'm able to maintain a pretty manageable 20-25lb weight loss from what I'd been the previous 5 years (meaning, I used to hover around 203lb, now I hover around 183lb + lots of muscle).\n\nFor the past 10 years, I've taken a certain dosage of ritalin for my ADD.  In the months that I'm on Keto, I only take half the dosage, and I can say with 100% certainty that I achieve the same (or higher) level of mental clarity and focus than I have when I'm off keto and taking the full dosage.  Pretty mind blowing.",

I know that keto has amazing benefits, but I really enjoy certain side dishes like mashed potatoes, fries, pasta, pizza, rice, etc., and I can't imagine just giving them up forever.  Also, I don't like to think of it as a \"cheat\" period because I always eat low-carb, and I rarely consume sugary foods or super high-carb foods like pancakes, donuts, sushi, or mac n cheese, so its not really that hard to transition between the two lifestyles.\n\nAlso, I find that some keto benefits will bleed over into my so-called \"cheat\" periods (e.g., maintaining the weight loss) and some \"cheat\" benefits bleed into my keto periods (e.g.,  retaining normal alcohol tolerance).  So I enjoy the balance, and the challenge.",

            "comment": "Not arguing that keto isn't beneficial for a whole range of things, or even this in particular, but the bi-product of cutting out carbs tends to be cutting out all of the other horrible crap in foods. There are a ton of conditions caused and made worse by a lot of the crap on our diets (see histamine and aut/ADHD links), and because keto cuts out so many foods, especially PROCESSED FOODS, we don't get a lot of this anymore. Gluten is a huge one. \n\nHow have you found the reduction in dopamine? Most who do keto get this a bit, but I (and a lot of ADHDers) have a really hard time with this.\n\nEdit: just clarifying the histamine bit isn't at all saying histamine causes autism or any of that rubbish, just in case it sounded that way.",

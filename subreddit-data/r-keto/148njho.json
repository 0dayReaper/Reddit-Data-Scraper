Your body has gotten wise to the lack of carbs and begins restoring any lost glycogen. This will appear as if you aren\u2019t losing.  But if your weight is the same and you\u2019ve added glycogen and water you\u2019re losing fat. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t tracking hunger can start to ramp up as you get used to the diet and way of eating.",

I dropped my calories more but that hasn\u2019t accelerated the weight loss and has just made me feel physically worse. \n\nDo you have any suggestions of resources that further explain this particular phenomenon.",

The first is that I\u2019d been losing weight for 14 months prior using The Zone, which is slightly lower in carbs than the standard western diet. Then I did a month at 100g and transitioned to keto at a 50g budget. I never lost more than .75 lbs per week when I was actively trying to lose. The other reason is I was quite active and started weight lifting about a month after keto. Added lifting to my walking 3-5 mile per day routine. So I never had a big loss of many pounds per week. Just consistent slow weightloss.",

I normally eat 2 times a day and I have a snack occasionally for example I been eating the snack pack chocolate pudding as a snack it's very sweet and really low on carbs it satisfies my sweet tooth .\n\nBut I don't do meal preps or anything I tend to eat alot of chicken wings with hot sauce and eat some nuts as snacks like spicy pistachios.\n\nI also buy 0 carb tortillas and I will occasionally get a burger with bacon and cheese and put it in the tortilla .",

Everyone looses weight at a different rate we are all different. This is my 3rd time on keto . The first 2 times I gave up because it's such a hard diet but I'm not stopping this time specially after seeing all the progress . I found a pair of pants that are tight on me when I started and every week I put them on to see the difference. Sometimes you may not show that you are loosing weight but when you try clothes on you can definitely tell you are so that helps me with staying more motivated.",

So I tend to order like chicken sandwich from a restaurant with bacon cheese lettuce and no buns then I just use my 0 carb tortillas as a replacement for the bread . So I'm still able to work around it but it makes it a challenge because I live in a very small town and keto food options eating out are very limited unless I want a salad every single time . \n\nI sit on a desk bored for a majority of my work day and boredom makes me want to snack or have something sweet . So I bring a snack pack chocolate pudding 0 sugar to work and that satisfies my craving every time . \n\nI don't like meal prepping I like to eat my food freshly made I'm also not the best cook so I have alot of challenges doing keto specially not being a fan of vegies. Luckily I have been able to manage and lose weight without an issue .",

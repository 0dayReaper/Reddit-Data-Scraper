    "postText": "Local grocery discount store was selling sugar-free Reese's cups for $5 for a decent sized bag, valued at $20 retail. I'm a businessman, so naturally, I took the opportunity to cash in on this deal. I had the suggested serving size of 3 peanut butter cups as soon as I got to my car (yes, I'm a fatass). Now, it is approaching midnight (PST), and I have to be up for work early in the am. But my stomach will not let me rest my weary mind and body. Upon further research on threads as old as 9 years ago, it appears that it is the maltitol in these candies that are causing me my discomfort. Somehow this happens once a year and I forget about it a week later. I still have the full bag, and I don't want it to go to waste. Would it be malicious of me to bring them to work for my coworkers to enjoy?",

So still better than sugar but still not great. I pretty much never eat maltitol due to the glycemic index plus the potential bathroom pyrotechnics.

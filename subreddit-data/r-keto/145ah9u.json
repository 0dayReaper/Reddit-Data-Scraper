    "postText": "Hello, first let me start of saying that I know my first week/first drastic amount of weight loss is water weight.\n\nI\u2019ve been measuring and keeping track of everything I\u2019m consuming and weight myself every so often. I\u2019m currently at 29 days of Keto.\n\nStarting weight: 207lbs.\nCurrent weight: 188.2lbs.\n\nMy first week I lost an estimate of 10lbs and I know that it was all of likely because of water weight. After that, I stagnated around the ~198lbs range for week two.\n\nThen on the third week I dropped down to 192-194lbs. Finally, as I\u2019m currently finishing up my fourth week after tomorrow, I weigh myself at 188-189lbs.\n\nI\u2019m worried I may be doing something wrong or unhealthy and want to make sure I\u2019m doing everything safe and correct.\n\nI use the MFP app to track my weight and daily food intake daily. On average I eat about 1500 calories, less than 20g of TOTAL Carbs, ~100g of fat, and ~120g of protein.\n\nHonestly, I quite rarely work out due to my work schedule. But when I do, I swim for about 1-2hours or do weight lifting. I work behind a computer daily so not much exercise there naturally.\n\nI\u2019ve also been struggling with my bowel movements. Today I started taking magnesium, zinc, and psyllium seed husk supplements. \n\nI\u2019ve been drinking 1-2 gallons of water a day. I believe I\u2019m not intaking enough electrolytes. \n\nAny advice, help, or tips would be appreciated. Thank you.",

There's some outrageous innacuracies / wish fulfilment entries there.\n\nSecondly your water intake at a couple of gallons.  That's about 9 litres which seems a bit excessive to me.\n\nI'm a tall guy who does a fair bit of exercise including sauna and I think I drink half that at a peak.  It makes me wonder about electrolytes and the incredible amount of time you must spend in the toilet every day.\n\nBoth minor points really, it does look like your doing it pretty right.",

I do however use some entries from outside food that I don\u2019t bother figuring out the nutrition for myself such as In-N-out, but I\u2019ll definitely keep your note in mind.\n\nAs for my water intake, I\u2019m honestly not sure\u2026 it just kind of comes naturally. I also feel dehydrated quite often, especially after sleeping. I also just like water tbh. Possibly an underlying personal issue maybe?\n\nThank you for your advice/tips.",

I find the lemon and ice make the \"taste\" better... I know ice doesn't taste but water bodies feel less salty with the ice.\n\nI don't know if the above covers all the electrolytes or is enough etc but the almonds are tasty anyway and the ice water/lemon is actually nice!",

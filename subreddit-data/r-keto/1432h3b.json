    "postText": "Honest question: if we don\u2019t go to the school of \u201cfat makes you fat\u201d then why are we still worried that high cholesterol in our diet making dangerous cholesterol in our bodies? Is that just a totally different proven thing? I read a long time ago that we shouldn\u2019t be concerned about cholesterol because it\u2019s not the same as the cholesterol in our blood, just like the fat we eat doesn\u2019t directly make the fat on our bodies (necessarily, you know what I mean). Is it known that eating high cholesterol causes our liver to kick up too much cholesterol in our blood? Have they proven that high cholesterol in a keto diet is truly damaging our hearts and brains? Or could it be that a high reading doesn\u2019t translate to cardiovascular issues?\nLike how can shrimp and eggs really be that bad for me? Just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. \nProbably just my wishful thinking.",

            "comment": "On a typical blood test, doctors use a threshold of 200 mg/dL for total cholesterol. Anything above that and they basically say you are unhealthy and at risk of cardiovascular disease. However all-cause mortality (risk of death from all causes) studies show that the ideal range is 210-249 mg/dL. For my particular age, my ideal value is 210-220. I have been 213 - 217 over the past 7 years and have to listen to my doc talk about statins every time I visit.  The study also shows that once you are over 45 years old, your hazard ratio (risk of premature death) increases as your cholesterol goes up OR down outside of the ideal range. Only those under the age of 45 see any benefit from slightly lower levels. There is a lot more to the story than total cholesterol, but since you did not seem to specify what kind of cholesterol, I thought you may find this study inteesting.\n\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-38461-y](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-38461-y)",

We make cholesterol from the fat we consumed.  \n\nSimilar to the misconception about eating fat will turn to fat.\n\nIt has been proven high cholesterol does not mean is bad.  Our body won\u2019t randomly produce harmful things and everything happens for a reason and the generalisation of HDL = good, while LDL = bad is wrong.  Blood tests and most doctors fail to identify LDL has (1) big fluffy particles, which our liver can latch onto, and (2) oxidised small particles that is the cause for clogged arteries leading to risk of cardiovascular diseases.  \n\nCholesterol is so demonised that everyone is afraid of cholesterol, just like fat.  But we also need cholesterol for vitamin D, hormones, testosterone, creation of bile\u2026.etc \n\nHigh cholesterol -&gt; bad -&gt; prescribe you statin\n\nHigh saturated fat -&gt; bad -&gt; sell you low fat products with sugar / high fructose corn syrup for flavours \n\nMisinformation everywhere while health care, big pharma / food profits.",

For example, most of my net carbs usually come from kefir and yogurt and that\u2019s on the top of the list, while cauliflower is lower on the list. \n\nYou can also input your own recipes or new products that aren\u2019t in the system with all the associated info.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like cronometer or free version of some app after trying it out, then you can go for a paid one that may serve you better.",

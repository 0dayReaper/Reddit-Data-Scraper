    "postText": "I started Keto over a year ago when I was diagnosed as \"pre-diabetic\", insulin resistant, and had other health problems.  EVERYONE in my life was against me doing keto, always telling me that it was a crazy fad diet and unhealthy, etc.  I had ZERO support in my life and relied on this sub as my support system.  It takes a while to synthesize all the information, and I found mostly great support on here.  All it took, however, was the occasional meany (telling me I was an idiot or making snarky comments) to get me down.  Many of us on here are trying to make a healthy change to save our lives and don't know all the information right out of the gate.  Please be kind to the noobs who are here looking for information and have questions.  If you have some information to share with a poster, just be kind (or at least just matter of fact) or just don't comment at all.  I've just introduced a friend to Keto and this sub, and going through it today I saw a few really snarky comments to noobs, and remembered what that was like when I was a noob.\n\nEdit: THANK YOU KIND STRANGER for the gold!!!  First time ever being gilded!!!\n\nEdit 2: Thank you to everyone who replied to this post!  Even some of the \"negative\" comments (not really that negative) were helpful.  Let's just be vigilant to protect this community because it supports those who want to make positive changes to their health and quality of life.  I believe keto is not only a weight loss tool but could be revolutionary in changing peoples lives in many ways.  KCKO",

I got kicked out of keto 3 different times due to lack of knowledge and two of them I decided to make cheat days. One of the days I had pasta and a real pepsi, the other cookies and a s'mores blizzard. Both days I felt nauseous and guilty after. You think you want these decadent, sugary foods until you have them. They made me appreciate keto and not want to undo all of the hard work I did. The last time i got kicked out (a few gulps of a limeade that wasn't diet like it was supposed to be) I came on here, asked for help, and received encouragement. Cheat days helped me see that I loved this diet and how I feel on it and made me want to ask for help instead of caving and eating garbage again.",

If you're just doing keto because you prefer that way of losing and maintaining weight, that won't be the same as someone who has some medical condition or some eating disorder that keeps coming back too easily with every relapse. I wouldn't judge people who have cheat days though, because I'm not them nor their doctor. If their cheat days is ok with them, then it's ok with them and that is great. If it isn't ok with them, then being malicious at them for it is bloody weird because it isn't going to make anything better for anyone.",

I train frequently so I am quite confident is isolating what works and what doesn't through a couple weeks of notes. Well... a lot didn't work, some did, but didnt have the results I wanted.\n\nIn the end, I stuck to 20g of carbs. Really NO carbs, but let that 20g be my safety net. This is what worked the best. &lt;20G actually made those miracle stories on this subreddit a reality. I wasn't high BF either, 18% with my eyes on 10%.\n\nWhile people can be stuck up sometimes I surrendered to the &lt;20g hype. Glad I did honestly. If you hear it enough, doesn't mean its not true or true, but there might be something to it. Also, my first post here.\n\nEDIT: forwarning though. While Keto has been the best, borderline magical, fat shreeding diet I have ever tried. Its an on/off switch that allows ZERO room for cheat days. My cheat days meant not having a significant calorie deficet, but as soo I &gt; 20g carbs - I could feel it turn off the next day....and that was NOT fun recovering - its awful going through the pains of \"switching on\".",

I think the problem comes in when people start acting as though their way is the only right way. For me personally, I have lost 30 lbs.

I think that anything that helps to keep someone on the diet is a good thing, and for me it is this. I struggled for seven months to fully commit to keto. I would do keto for several days and then I\u2019d cheat. Have some donuts or something. I would go back and forth on it, always feeling guilty when I gave in. Finally, I had some blood work done. I had only lost one pound in those seven months, and my A1C had risen from 5.8 to 6. Seeing those numbers gave me the wake up call I needed, and I started doing keto in earnest. If someone wants to judge me for enjoying keto baking, that says more about their character than it does about mine.  I know for a fact that having an alternative that fits my macros has helped me stay on it. TL;DR - Everyone\u2019s different! KCKO! \u270c\ud83c\udffc ",

That's not just hyperbole or feeling emotionally sick... You actually feel pukey after having sugar once you've detoxed off of it. This makes cheating no fun and makes it much easier to say no and stick to the keto foods. It becomes less about 'not being able to have that anymore' and more about eating the other delicious foods (bacon) without getting that sick feeling.\nI've cheated a couple times with a big pile of popcorn. So sweaty and nauseous afterward. I just don't anymore. And it's easy.\nJump on, Emika, this is the fun wagon! ",

I'm still losing (slowly) so it works for me.\n\nSome people are doing paleo, some people are simply calorie counting, some people do the tons of proteins thing, and some people do zero carbs. It doesn't matter as long as it works. What's important is to find a diet you can follow long term, and  that doesn't impact your health negatively.\n\nGive keto a shot, you can always switch to something else if you don't like it.",

I'm lazy keto and only mentally track my carbs (it's not hard with one or two meals per day) and otherwise don't weigh or count anything else. I just keep an eye on portion size.

I guess that makes me strict and/or I fit into some specific place on that spectrum. At the same time, I welcome all newcomers! I don't understand why people would be impatient or unkind. I did post elsewhere in this thread that I wish beginners would search the sub more - there is such a wealth of information here that many do not access. But if they don't, so it goes.

Some people will do those things in extreme moderation (i do prefer a carrot or two in my pot roast since I don't do potatoes, for example) because those carbs add up very quickly. \n\nIMO everything depends on you and your body chemistry. Can you get away with a potato once in awhile? Go for it! However, I absolutely can't as it will kick me out of keto.",

A stepping stone to taking things more seriously. After 2 months I plateaud, and cut out fruits, peas, beans. Really tying to focus on reducing net carbs and increasing fats, but I still struggle to get below 50g net carbs a day because I feel awful if I dont eat vegetables with every meal. To be at 10% would be 30g net carbs and that is my goal, but it may take some time to get there, I cant imagine how anyone gets to 15g (5% for me) without cutting vegetables out of their diet completely.",

Lunch was usually left overs from the previous nights dinner or s big leafy salad with an olive oil vinegar home made dressing and some chicken in there. Dinner we (husband is also keto) usually grill or instant pot up some form of meat, chicken, steak, pork chops, a roast, fish etc etc with a double side of veggies; asparagus, broccoli, zucchini, etc etc we do use seasoning on our meat, salt, pepper, seasoned salt, paprika, garlic powder...whatever the meat calls for. It\u2019s not as fancy as some people do but it\u2019s delicious and filling. Been doing keto for almost 6 months now. It works for us.\n\nETA: I don\u2019t usually snack, if I feel I need a snack I might have a handful of nuts or some cheese. If I feel snacking it\u2019s usually because my last meal didn\u2019t have enough fat. I almost never eat breakfast anymore, frequently fast through breakfast and lunch and occasionally fast  longer. Just today I broke a 38 hour fast. ",

Then there will always be a troll or two who are there to stir up trouble just for the hell of it. They might have no interest in the keto diet at all, but they can have their say because it is a public space. *(Late edit: perfect example below \ud83d\ude06.)*\n\nI know it's easy to say \"just ignore them\" but that is much easier said than done.\n\nJust don't forget all the comments of encouragement and support, which are *much* more numerous.\n\nGood luck and enjoy your keto journey.\n\n\n",

I\u2019ve been in a bit of a plateau most of June/July not straying much from Keto, but I\u2019m getting closer to my goal weight... No biggie. Doing lazy Keto, I assumed I might have to re-assess what I was doing at some point. Well, I went on vacation for 5 days with my family, I ate whatever I wanted, had a great time, got home, weight was just about where it was when I left (2 pounds up), got back on the Keto train, hit an all-time new low twice this past week.\n\nHaters are going to hate. This sub doesn\u2019t have to be strict Keto for the sake of being in ketosis. There are such things as modified Keto diets, I think those should have a place here as well. The goal should be overall health, and we\u2019re all in different places and different approaches will work better or worse for different people.\n\nRight now I\u2019m looking at losing this last 7 pounds, along with trying to make sure I\u2019m eating better fats, with more omega 3s and 9s vs 6s... still doing my homework on that front, but as far as weight loss goes, I\u2019m almost there and transitioning to the next phase of my Keto dieting.",

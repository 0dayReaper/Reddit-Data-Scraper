Give your body and brain plenty of time to adapt and work in more intensive workouts slowly. \n\nAnd always, eat lots and lots of meat, eggs and cheese!\n\nHope this helped.",

It impacts my willpower. I increased the intensity over the past 2 weeks and weight loss has been slowing down. I am trying to time my workouts for the toughest part of the day for hunger since I dont seem to be very hungry while at the gym and I typically workout in a fasted state. I started trending fat % using the crude measurement on my bathroom scale thinking maybe I am seeing some muscle gain. It jumps all over, but in general the trend remains down.",

Electrolytes certainly have helped.  I tend to have a mug of Bovril with an extra 1g of low salt added prior to starting the bike ride to the gym.  I use an electrolyte supplement that I add to water especially in the sauna, but sometimes also for swimming as I have always been prone to cramps in the legs when swimming.\n\n2. Sometimes recently the sauna has been making me a touch dizzy.  I've been doing sauna for a couple of years now and I put this down mostly to a significant increase in my exercising recently.  I tend to take a bit of rest (15 minutes or so seated after dressing) before I get on the bike to ride home.  I carry 60g (2 portions) of protein powder should I feel I need it before the ride home if I do feel very hungry or particularly flattened out.  So far I have not used it, but having some calories on hand in case is handy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResults.  So far 33lbs of weight loss, 12 cm reduction on my belly circumference, 5% lower body fat and 4% increase in muscle mass.  I'm about halfway to my weight loss goal, the exercise has increased steadily over the 8 weeks I've been back on keto.",

Finally hit my long term goal weight I set 5 years ago, it's been really good for me. My sleep is immensely better, and that's a huge relief for me, and overall everything is just easier for me. \n\nThe biggest struggle I have is I have 2 kids at home, a 15yo and a 12yo and they don't do keto so their crap is always around and it's hard to resist sometimes. \nStaying hydrated is hard for me, too, because too much liquid has always made me nauseated so I do small amounts constantly. I also do mostly fasted workouts for the same reason - working out when I've already eaten is a recipe for disaster",

Keto under 20 carbs per day (most days around 10), IF 16:8 and I try to workout 3 to 5 times a week depending on what I have going on in the week. Most recent workouts consist of high intensity cardio (think 160 average heart rate), 50 squats and then come arm and ab work. \n\nDefinitely think all three are a winning combo \ud83d\udcaf\n\nEta \nDrink plenty of water I try to average over 100ounces a day. I prefer fasted workouts, but that isn't everyone's cup of tea.\n\nNot a struggle per say but a frustration. I'm a data girl and I like things that are specific. My weight loss (and I don't know if it's because I change my workouts up some weeks or what because I eat consistently the same) is very non linear. One week I lose 1 to 2 pounds and the next 4 to 6. It has been happening like that for weeks not. I don't get it but hey it's still weight loss lol \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

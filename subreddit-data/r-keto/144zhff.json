    "postText": "I have been doing Keto for 6 months, with occasional days off to enjoy holidays and time with my extended families. Now I\u2019m trying to get more consistency and I\u2019m starving, I have increased my calories from 1300 to 1700 on most days. My net carbs are less than 25. I weigh 133 pounds and am 5ft3. I had hoped to lose another 5-10 pounds but I\u2019m happy maintaining. I\u2019m just so hungry. \n\nThe only thing that has changed is I started using sugar free boiled sweets a lot, and as the weather is lovely I have a portion of homemade Keto icecream each day. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m craving carbs, I\u2019m mostly craving cheese, salad and veg.\n\nI have no way of verifying that I\u2019m in ketosis as the sticks haven\u2019t worked in months for me and a blood monitor is out if my price range. I feel good, and don\u2019t have any of the side effects that happened when I first started the diet.",

Cut them out for a week and see if the hunger goes away. \n\nElectrolytes also play a huge part in hunger control. How many mgs of sodium, magnesium, and potassium are you getting every day? How are you tracking these?",

I add a lot of salt and so haven\u2019t bothered tracking sodium, plus my diet is full of magnesium and potassium rich foods. I have put my collection of sweets in the bin. I started using them to deal with the weird cheesy mouthfeel of ketosis but I think I find them addictive.",

It sucks because I want a treat sometimes, but it just makes the hunger the next day so much harder. \nLately, I've been having a tablespoon of almond butter as a treat. \nIt's not super sweet but fulfills my sweet tooth/ treat need and so far it doesn't seem to trigger extra hunger.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone !\n\nI did a bit of research and I know this subject has been touched on quite often, but I couldn't find any particular case that was quite similar to mine.\n\nI went on the keto diet about three weeks ago, being I would say roughly 95% carnivore. At first I felt absolutely great. I reach ketosis in about 4 days and then I got insanely good sleep, I had high libido, my mind was absolutely clear; I basically had all the good side-effects of these types of diet.\n\nNow we're in week three, and my energy levels have been going down for the past week. These past two days I feel like my testosterone absolutely tanked. I feel weak and tired, I have zero energy, zero libido; I can't even complete a workout.I'm operating with a low calorie deficit: roughly 500kcals a day as I do want to lose a bit of weight. I did lose 3.5 kg the first two weeks, but I recently gained back 1kg. I was pretty surprised about that.\n\nI don't count calories and don't really pay attention to my macros, I just make sure to avoid all processed foods, eat mostly fat and protein and that's pretty much it. I had lots of electrolyte drinks in the beginning as I did go through keto flu and that mostly fixed things. The weakness I've been feeling these past couple of days is a bit different than I felt in the beginning ?\n\nAny idea why my energy levels would tank like that ? Anyone had a similar experience to mine ?Thanks !",

You don\u2019t need any fancy products or pills for sodium and potassium. Magnesium glycinate is very cheap on amazon to boot.\n\nThe keto flu is nothing more than electrolyte deficiency. **It can happen anytime you are deficient, not just at the start.** Google \u201cketoade recipes\u201d and start feeling better. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nThere\u2019s more info in the FAQ if you\u2019d like to know more:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq",

I\u2019m very off if I don\u2019t have them. I\u2019m early on, but the importance of having them might not have gone away. How do you know you\u2019re in a 500 calorie deficit if you aren\u2019t tracking? Too high of a deficit can crash your testosterone. I know it isn\u2019t carnivore, but avocado has boron in it, which is important for testosterone production. 100g avocado would be enough for most people. It\u2019s the most keto friendly source I\u2019m aware of.",

After you get that, create a free Cronometer account and start weighing your food and beverages to track calories. Another benefit of Cronometer is that you will be able to see nutrient deficiencies, especially minerals like sodium, potassium, and magnesium. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, most fruits and vegetables are deficient in these minerals because the soils are deficient, and most electrolyte drinks do not provide nearly enough sodium, potassium and magnesium if you don't supplement them. The only way to find out is to see what you are getting from food, and then backfill the rest either through a ketoaid or adding certain foods, like avocado to bridge the gap. \n\nChances are, you are not getting enough sodium and you are at more than a 500 calorie deficit. What you are feeling is low energy brought on by eating too little calories and low sodium levels before actually being fat adapted, which can take anywhere from 6 weeks to 3 months for some people. \n\nFor now, throw a 1/4 teaspoon of salt in water and drink that. If you don't feel better in 30 minutes, do it again. Chances are you will feel better after that. Sprinkle salt in your coffee, and throughout the day sprinkle salt in your water or drink regular broth, it should help until you get scale and cronometer set up.",

I did cronometer and was only eating 1900 calories and not getting enough potassium and magnesium, and sodium was only 2500. Once I corrected that, I was all good immediately. Low sodium screws up the electrolyte balance, which cause potassium to get purged, and when potassium gets purged, magnesium follows.\n\nYour tongue is the best salt tool nature ever devised, salt tastes good when you need it, and salt starts to taste too salty when you have had enough for the time being.",

                    "comment": "You may want to add an asterisk about Ultima being \"the best brand\". :P\n\nUltima lacks both potassium and magnesium. You'll need several servings a day or to drink Ultima plus other supplements. I use Ultima after I use Dr bergs electrolytes to change flavor up and get more sodium at that stage.\n\n\nI've never heard about cottage cheese in coffee. Does it...dissolve or just turn clumpy at the bottom? And are you talking Teaspoon or tablespoon?",

Have you read the FAQ about the suggested amount of Sodium and Potassium? I'm not arguing with you about it tasting good or such, but it's far from 'the best brand' in terms of people buying premade electrolyte mixes. I will stand by my first comment, I like Ultima for flavor but Dr. Berg has it beat in every single form from cost to quality of ingredients to actual amount of electrolytes.",

It seems my quick response to OP may have been sloppy is essence (I was quickly responding in a few spare moments during my day). \n\nMy quick response was not a catch-all, but rather some suggestions that have helped me in my experience. Of course one electrolyte supplement isn\u2019t going to solve the bigger picture. Another excellent point you have made is the fact that keto is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Tiny tweaks here and there work wonders for us all, and there isn\u2019t one thing that can magically assist the process, but rather several small things.\n\nSupplementing in general with additional vitamins and minerals is a huge component of this process.\n\nNo, ultima is not going to provide all the perfect portions, but when I\u2019m dragging on energy it sure helps. \u201cThe best\u2026\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the perfect solution, just one of the quick assistants I have found in my journey.",

It\u2019s my ADF fasting day. \n\nI have, however, planned a trip to the grocery store this afternoon. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s not smart to hit the grocery on an empty stomach, but I\u2019ll need food to break my fast with tomorrow and I\u2019m out of eggs. \ud83e\udd23\n\nI do have a list though\u2026 that will help.",

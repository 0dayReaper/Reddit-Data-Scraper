    "postText": "So I got my blood work done pre and post-keto. Keeping in mind I'm not strict on keto - I try to keep low-carb/slow-carb whenever possible + add good fats as much as possible. I also eat normally when out with friends (gotta enjoy life!)\n\nMy blood work is great - triglycerides, fasting insulin, HbA1c, fasting glucose = all low. C-reactive protein super low, my doc says I basically have no inflammation in my body.\n\nHowever my cholesterol keeps going up. It's gone out of range to what they consider \"normal\" or \"healthy\". I've googled around and found this is the experience for heaps of people on keto. But I'm looking for a comprehensive answer why. \n\nI found a Dr Peter Attia video on how cholesterol measurements in standard blood tests don't provide the full picture and that we should ask for tests on Apolipoprotein B (Apo B). I'm not doing to ask my doc for that because he's pretty much senile and could barely figure out how to arrange for my blood work to be done in the first place, but that's another story. \n\nCan someone please explain what's happening without skimping over the details? Do I need to modify my diet to be cleaner and focus on vegetables? Or is high cholesterol more nuanced than what a simple test can reveal?",

That's a good takeaway from your bloodwork.\n\nTo answer your question, LDL is a means of transporting fat around your body. By itself, a high LDL just means your body is going through a lot of fat -- it doesn't specify why. When you have metabolic syndrome, your LDL will be high because your body is storing lots of fat, however in that case your trigs would also be high. On keto you're simply burning a lot of fat for energy, so that's why your LDL is as high as it is.",

            "comment": "The mainstream medicine like to identify HDL = good, and LDL = bad.  \n\nCholesterol inherently is crucial to the survival of our body, without it, we will die.  So, to simply categorise LDL, something our body naturally produce to be bad is far from the truth.  However, that is what doctors will tell you, and that is what your blood test result says, because they want to prescribe you statin.  \n\nThe big fluffy LDLs is what the LDL receptors in your liver can latch onto.  We need this.  It\u2019s healthy.  \n\nWhen LDL gets oxidised, they are turned into small particles which can not attach itself to the LDL receptors, and it\u2019s these that gets clogged up in your arteries leading to cardiovascular diseases.  \n\nMainstream medicine and guidelines is geared towards the mass majority and the majority is following the standard average diet full of seed oils, trans fat, partially hydrogenated oils, high fructose corn syrup, sugar, modern wheat.  Therefore it is not entirely wrong to assume the measured LDLs is mainly small particle LDL because, everyone is eating that trash.\n\nHowever, if you are keto / carnivore and cooking with grass fed tallow or simply high quality saturated fat and not following the standard average diet, the LDL results from your blood test is meaningless because it is most likely your LDLs are big fluffy without much oxidation.  Instead, just look at your triglycerides and HDL, if they r good, that\u2019s all you need to know because general blood works and doctors are not equipped to look into LDL to measure the particle size.\n\nWe need cholesterol to convert to other stuff, such as turning them into vitamin D, hormones like testosterone, bile\u2026etc so, how can cholesterol be inherently bad.  Misinformation everywhere and has infiltrated into professional practice.",

I said lady I ain't touching statins with a million foot pole.\n\nIt makes zero sense that all my blood work is optimal but I'd need to go on statins? There's something extremely off about normal health check-ups being driven by pharmaceutical profiteering and doctors are being extremely negligent by prescribing drugs willy-nilly. Don't get me started on SSRIs.",

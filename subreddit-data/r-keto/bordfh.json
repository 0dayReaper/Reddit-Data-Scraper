You're all wonderful people and I'm so honored to stand in battle with you. Thank you for your openness. Thank you for sharing your struggles. Thank you for answering my questions. Thank you all for your humor and love. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7**nsfw**\n\nI was going to wait another five pounds so I could do my 100 pound celebration, but today was just too awesome not to share. See, I fit into a pair of size 12 jeans for the first time in eight years.\n\nIn the first photo I was 232 lbs, 18 pounds shy of my eventual max of 250. The after is today about 60 seconds after I accidentally slipped right into a pair of size 12's. Today I weigh 155.\n\nI bought them to tuck away into my bottom drawer as my 'one day' pants. When I got home and held them up I snorted. \"Oh, these are little girl pants! Maybe if I ever lose twenty pounds.\" I just wanted to try them on to see how far I had to go. I haven't worn jeans since I grew past my size 22's years ago.\n\nThey slipped right up! I actually froze when they easily cleared my butt and hips. Paused for a moment, then tentatively tried to button them. They buttoned and zipped up like they were made for me.\n\nThree minutes later I was sitting on the floor of my closet blubbering happy, snotty tears of joy into the phone with my daughter on the other end. She sent me this 'before' pic - that I'd totally forgotten existed - in response. \"Stop telling me you don't see a difference!!\"\n\nBefore and After\n\n[https://imgur.com/fmyrlA8](https://imgur.com/fmyrlA8)\n\nI think I can safely say that I'm not fat anymore. I'm really not fat. Not even 'chubby'. I dare say, I think I actually look good! Everything from here on out is gravy.\n\nI'll do a better write up and after photos when I hit the 100 pound mark and then I'll tell the story of how my body fell apart and how I found my way home again. But for today I'll just say...\n\nI'M NOT FAT ANYMORE!!!",

The first photo was one I was so deeply ashamed of that my brain actually blocked it out. Actually made me nauseated to look at it. Hurt my heart so deeply.  \n\n\nNow I want to show the planet. \"THIS IS WHAT MEAT DID!! LOOK! LOOK AT WHAT \\*I\\* DID!!\" lmao!",

                            "comment": "I was very, very sick in photo #1. I have scleroderma, ulcerated colitis, arthritis, myositis, and probably a dozen more 'itises' thrown in there. My body is killing itself. At the time, we didn't know what was wrong with me. I only got my diagnosis in Dec of 2017.\n\nThat's when my doctor told me to switch to keto for inflammation and to NEVER, EVER stop. I'd had surgery a few months before that and starved off the first 18 pounds because I simply couldn't eat because of the pain. (I was eating a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of soup every other day for five months and only lost 18 freaking pounds. grrrr!!)\n\nI switched to keto for New Years 2018. Dropped down to 212... then had to have another surgery with a 4 month recovery. The post-op diet was horrible and I regained ten pounds. \n\nRight after my last birthday in August I got fed up with the dying thing and switched to carnivore for the inflammation. \n\nNow with keto, I lost weight. I could actually eat food and I still lost weight.\n\nUnfortunately regular keto didn't touch the autoimmune and inflammation problems so I had to go SUPERKETO (carnivore is really just whole-food keto without the veggies) to ramp it up. \n\nI lost at the same pace with carnivore as I did with regular keto, but it really is saving my life. I haven't had an arthritis or scleroderma skin flare in months. The IBS is under control and I don't poop blood anymore. No more PAIN. \n\nSo from that photo until now is 21 months. Had the surgery hiccup that set me back by five months. (Surgical prep was a month of hell where I stalled.) I'd say it would be fair for a woman without my medical problems to do that in a year. An easy year in a half.\n\nThat's intuitive eating (eat when you're hungry, don't eat if you're not, STOP when you're full) and not starving myself once ever. \n\nAnd - other than the surgery - I've been really constant. Stayed steady through the holidays. Ripped my hair out, but talked myself through the hell days when I wanted to scream \"SCREW EVERYTHING I'M EATING THE DAMN DOUGHNUT AND I WANT ICE CREAM AND REESES NOW!!\" Didn't break.\n\nMy worst trip was when I did submit to the pain and drank too often last fall. I got control of that fast. In the end, it only made my situation worse. Some days it was a relief just to crawl into bed and end it.\n\nBut most days it wasn't like that. Most days, it's just fine. Most days are fun. I enjoy cooking again. I enjoy trying on clothes again. I enjoy putting on makeup (now that I know how!) and I enjoy walking and movement. It's so damn easy now!\n\nHoney, please try not to think about 'the goal' at all. Just think about today. Take pride in *this* meal. Be happy with all the wonderful NSVs and the SVs and try to enjoy your life while you're working this system in the background. Trust that it'll continue to improve and that, no matter where you are in six months, it'll be so much BETTER than the place you're in now. \n\nThis is like being pregnant. You can't force this baby to come. Nature has Her own pace and you can't fight it. You'll hit your content point long before your goal weight. A place where you smile when you catch a glimpse of your reflection in the store window instead of cringe. When you get there, it's all okay. then the weight can come off however fast or slow it wants because YOU are alright. After that, this is so easy.",

It\u2019s so encouraging to see someone with health issues and a body like mine be successful and happy when they look in the mirror.\n\nI have Hashimoto hypothyroidism and PCOS with insulin resistance (which causes infertility and I required fertility drugs to conceive that also caused some side effects). Both diseases have caused a great deal of weight gain and make weight loss very difficult. Back in December 2018 my doctor changed my thyroid medication and my numbers went so bad that I gained over 25 lbs in 6 weeks despite a total loss of appetite. I have two very young children (3 and 1) that I can barely keep up with.  \n\nIt\u2019s very difficult not to focus on the goal because I\u2019ve only been large for about 6 years. I know what I look like at a healthy weight. I know what I feel like at a healthy weight, and it\u2019s so hard to stay positive when the weight piles on and diets never have any effect even without cheating. \n\nI\u2019m so ashamed of the way I look, it\u2019s easy to focus on the negative. I shall try to take your advice about the pride in current days and meals to heart, I think that\u2019s exactly what I need to do. Thank you. I shall look into Super Keto as well since I also struggle with autoimmune and inflammation. \n\nGood luck on your continued journey to good health!",

I take my compounded progesterone, but no thyroid yet because I'm not 'low enough' to warrant a prescription.\n\nYou're going to LOVE this one. \n\nSo when I was 41 I started having hot flashes and sweats and bursts of tears out of the blue for no reason. I had a hysterectomy, but kept my ovaries a few years prior so the doc did blood tests and it showed I was in menopause. \n\nI went though 4 years of hell, then it all stopped (thank the Lord) and more tests showed that I was over it. The girl-parts had packed it in.\n\nSo I was back to the doc for more tests (now I have a freaking TEAM of specialists working me over so I don't die on 'em) and the doctor says, \"Well, your thyroid is still a little twitchy. We'll keep testing that and hopefully catch it fast when it finally dies, and your progesterone is a little low. That just means that you'll be starting menopause in a couple of years. I'll give you some progesterone to help you out until then.\"\n\nMy husband was with me and we both shared a puzzled glance. I said, \"Uh, I finished menopause a few years ago.\"\n\nThe doctor's brows did this weird, confused wiggle-thing and he finally shook his head. \"Um, no. Other than being a little low in the progesterone department, you're fine. You were ovulating when we did this test.\"\n\n\"Ovulating?\" I whispered.\n\n\"Yup!\" he said cheerfully. \"If you had a uterus you'd be a fertile, healthy woman. Even with the progesterone issue, you could get pregnant right now. No problem.\"\n\nMy husband's face was BEET red. He gave me a look of such accusation that I couldn't help but bust out laughing.\n\nOn the way out to the car he kept muttering, \"I am SO glad I had a vasectomy. SO glad.\"\n\nEight months. Eight months is what it took to reverse my girl problems.\n\nAND in the same appointment I found out that I had NO signs of insulin resistance at ALL. I'd passed my orange drink tests with flying colors and my background fasting insulin levels were actually LOW. I've been fighting IR and pre-diabetes since 1999. \n\nSo KETO FREAKING WORKS FOR HEALTH. \n\nI do think that the reason my thyroid has been able to hang on by it's fingernails for this long is because of the superketo, though. Kind of arrested the destruction.\n\nTake your hormones, girl! If you're on the synthetic stuff, look into Armor or natural thyroid (that's what finally helped both my mom and my aunt finally lose weight) and KCKO. \n\nYou're doing the best thing you can for your body, honey. I promise. You're on the right track.",

Synthetic T4 and T3 combined with a bit of natural. He takes it spaced out in three doses. I believe it's one in the morning, one at lunch, and a third dose in the afternoon to get him over the slump. That was the corner-turner for him. \n\nIn his case, weight wasn't so much the problem as the energy and brain fog was. He brightened up fast! And did dump fifteen pounds that hadn't even been bothering him. He's also doing carnivore, but that wasn't fixing the problem for him. Helped with other things, but not the thyroid.\n\nBe consistent with the diet and if you're not getting the results you expect, try something else. That's what I had to do and with each change that was positive, I moved a little bit more in the right direction. Switching to 'almost carnivore' helped. Finally taking the plunge into real carnivore helped more. Getting sunshine made a dramatic difference. Giving up dairy is another. Adding vitamin C was another. Dropping some meds helped, too. Piece by piece the puzzle began to come together.\n\nI think that's why it took me so long. I was willing to do anything but I had no idea what the hell to do!",

Keto has really improved my quality of life, it happens faster than you think. I lost 35lbs in 2 months on strict keto (tracking macros + trying to maximize micros), despite allowing my sweet tooth with keto sweets (I use erythritol and monk fruit extract). I've never been a healthy weight so I don't know what my ideal weight/look is, yet, and I've still got a long road ahead (somewhere between 50-80 pounds, I imagine?) but I'm 60lbs lighter than my max (and 50 of that were lost with keto, the other 10 I lost over a course of 4 years when I cut out processed food. HA!) and my body is doing things I never thought were even remotely possible. Namely, my periods have gone from crippling and extreme (without pain medication I WOULD curl up and bawl and wish to just drop dead cause it felt like I'm being sliced open) to damn near pain-free. My period is still ever-changing (and I'm sure it'll change some more as I lose more) but 4 months ago it was my husband who first noticed I'm on period (we were intimate and he looked down and yeah..... and it was the STRANGEST moment to be told BY MY HUSBAND that I'm bleeding when usually I'd lie in bed crying the day BEFORE it started. I didn't feel it coming AT ALL!!!!!!!!), my uterus has seemed to develop a habit in the last 2 months to squeeze 90% of it out in the first 2 days (to the point I can harly keep up with it lol) and then just trickle along (no tampon needed despite being on period) for the last few.When I'm not tracking and doing IF like I usually do I can feel a decline in my physical performance, but lately I've been back to tracking and strict and have lost another 10lbs in around a month and I'm waking up at about the same time every day again. I used to sleep in until 10am or later and feel groggy, now I wake up between 7-8am (without alarm!) and I feel great!\n\nJust accept and love keto in the moment like OP said. Every meal, every day is one step closer to a much more comfortable and empowering future. You're gaining those little points and it really pays off. And before you know it you'll be annoyed how your favorite shirt isn't looking right on you anymore because it's become so baggy. Like for OP, Keto will be my forever lifestyle. While I WILL allow for carby treats once I reach my goal weight (like watermelon, cause I can't live a life without it! LOL. Fruits in general.) I'll always majorily be on keto. It's too empowering to ever let it go, and I've learned that when I hadn't tracked for 3 months (personal reasons), while I didn't lose any weight on \"lazy keto\", I very easily maintained (staying within the same 2-4lbs range), so it's great to know that once I'm at my goal I will naturally be able to keep my weight without having to pay any attention to it. It's so goddamn liberating. Enjoy the journey!!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Adding that I'm on no type of prescription medication (incl. BC). I only specifically take a Vitex supplement to combat my painfully sensitive nips (started when I took BC).  Other than that I only take supplements, occasionally, as necessary (since I track I just take what I might lack that day, like some days I get almost no Vitamin E, other days I max it out with ease). I watched my grandma take a dozen and more pills every single day. It was such a horrifying thought to even START on that road with even just one medication that I refused ever getting any (Gyn recommended Metformin, I simply didn't get my hormones checked at the place she recommended cause I didn't care to even have that conversation). Thankfully with Keto I likely won't need any. It's a relief to further distance myself from the path my granny has taken. For all I know my PCOS symptoms might have been more bearable with medications but it's just a personal thing for me that I avoid medi. So in terms of all that I have no advice to give but it's not like either of us will truly need much of anything with this type of lifestyle!!",

It never has with me, but even that was extreme.\n\nI do believe that it had something to do with the massive inflammation and autoimmune disease issue. Throw in 14 total surgeries and the stress of relentless cancer-level pain and my body was in panic/survival mode big time.\n\nWhen I switched from keto to carnivore I lost eight inches of inflammation from my waist measurement and 16 pounds in the first week. I wasn't full of gas or food. My intestines were actually *that* swollen and I had fluid buildup in the peritoneal cavity. So my guts were actually just floating in there.\n\nI cannot stress enough how close I was to dying. With my level of autoimmune involvement, my prognosis was only two more years max. When I say my GI system was under attack, that means every single thing from the lips to the other end. I have massive scar tissue in my esophagus and have to get scoped every year to make sure that stays stable. One good cough and it can rupture. My liver was in trouble. My vascular system was literally exploding and I had unbelievable fluid buildup in my legs from the poor circulation. \n\nWhen your body is shutting down like that, all bets are off. There are no hard and fast rules. My metabolism went as low as it could possibly go to just keep my brain (mostly) functioning and my heart beating. Body temp ran a constant 97, my BP shot up 50 points, and my resting heart rate stayed in the 145-180 range. Everything was abnormal. The next conversation with my rheumatologist was to tell him that I was finally ready to start chemo but that it had to wait until I got the colostomy bag.\n\nRight now I'm nine months into the 24 I was projected to having left. And I'm only getting better. Unless I'm involved in a tragic car accident, I can't imagine not making it now.",

Pretty much all carbs (anything that spikes the blood sugar &gt;insulin cycle) are instantly stored in the fat and carbs need water to be processed (which is why ppl lose so much water weight at the beginning, I think it's 1g sugar to 4g water?). Making for some hefty weight gain (in both fat/water). Losing weight with PCOS/IR is damn near impossible on a carb-y diet because of the hormones that simply won't allow for fat to be burnt (insulin pretty much disables fat burning), short from starving yourself to where your body DOESN'T HAVE A CHOICE but to burn fat. Plus the excessive insulin starves the rest of your body (cause your cells other than fat just can't absorb energy) so it's possible you feel you're STARVING even if you're currently HURTING from the amount of food in your gut (been there, done that and it's beyond depressing.)  \nI had switched my diet to non-processed, cooked from scratch (cut out sugar and most flour, too) but still had a ton of carbs (fruits and such), only lost around 10 pounds effectively in 4 years. Vs 35lbs in 2 months on Keto. Hormones are more powerful than people think and for PCOS/IR ladies it's an especially hard to beat hellhole. I've become convinced there is no sustainable way to lose weight on PCOS/IR with carbs in the diet (I'm not saying it's impossible, just that it's not something you can happily do without losing your goddamn mind over the constant cravings and crippling sensation of starvation and fatigue)",

It turns out that all of the resistance and pain was my body trying to tell me that something was very wrong. Now that my body is getting what it needs and not being poisoned anymore, it's so much happier. Complains much less.   \n\n\nNow the damn thing is whining that it needs to MOVE. All the time or it hurts. \\*sigh\\* So now I'm doing what I can to stay on my feet as much as possible. It does get frustrating because I love to write and I can't find a position that makes the body happy for long periods of time.  \n\n\nI pretty much eat carnivore now (meat, liver, salmon, some egg yolks) with herbs, spices, coffee and some herbal iced tea. I cook with lard and butter. Butter is the only dairy I eat now and it's not as much as I used to.   \n\n\nI don't track macros at all. I do take my electrolytes and vitamin C (I do need the C) and that's about it.  \n\n\nThis is really the ultimate keto elimination diet. Once I started getting better I quickly figured out how to identify problem items. Like oregano. I had no idea that I had a problem with oregano until I went clean for 3 weeks (beef, salt, water) then brought it back in. I did have a keto coconut flour bread in the beginning, but the fiber is really too much for me with the GI problems.   \n\n\nIt really is the best way to eat for inflammation. Arthritis was pretty much gone within two weeks. I've only had two minor, short-lived scleroderma flares and two arthritis flares since I've begun. (One was from eating seed oils at a Chinese buffet and the second one I think was a total system malfunction from getting sick with bronchitis.)   \n\n\nI go to the bathroom only once every 1-3 days. A few times longer, but 2-3 days is pretty normal now. That's coming from 12+ episodes a day for years.   \n\n\nI don't eat egg yolks often any more, but when I do I usually eat them raw. Rarely have whole cooked eggs as a treat. LOTS of salmon, beef and raw liver. A little chicken or pork. I try to keep that down to about once a week or so. It's too high in Omega 6 for me to go nuts with. Two or three servings of raw liver a week for lunch. Sometimes I'll use a bit of honey as a glaze for my meat.   \n\n\nAt first, I gotta admit, it was pure hell. I still have times when I'm just dying for something sweet. Then I have two options. Egg yolks in a blender with a little water, pure monk fruit sweetener, and some cinnamon or vanilla. Tastes like egg nog when I do nutmeg and cinnamon. Like cold cream when I use vanilla. It's actually REALLY good and I've got every woman I know drinking this stuff. lol! Everyone has their favorite 'recipe.' My cousin uses honey. Got a friend who loves the nutmeg. My mom's a real vanilla bean girl. I can also have sugar free jello with a LOT of extra gelatin. So I cut the water in half to make the Jello Jigglers recipe then add 3 packages plain gelatin for every package of Jello. Pour that into a pan and let it set up over night. It's actually got a bit of a bite to it and is much more satisfying than a bowl of jello. You can just lop off a piece and walk away, no bowl required. I make a batch once a month.  \n\n\nThat's SO not okay on this diet, but I've got to stay on the diet. At least this doesn't jack up my ketosis and I don't appear to have any major problems after I eat it. That's the only artificial thing in my life.  \n\n\nI've been eating this way for almost nine months and it really doesn't bother me anymore. It's pretty easy to resist temptation when I think about where I've come from. I'm starting to truly enjoy cooking meat and right now I'm in the process of drawing up plans for our smoker. We just bought a huge refrigerator so I can start aging primal cuts and hubby wants to buy a young pig this fall. Hopefully I'll be making my own sausage and bacon here soon. Next weekend my husband is setting up my fry station outside so I can do my messy once-a-week fry up without the consequences. lol!  \n\n\nThe thing is, it works. I'm not dying anymore. I'm not 100%, but no longer in the red and, for the first time in a long time, I have hope for a future. I can go shopping now! My goal is to be well enough to go to an AC/DC concert next year. I'm starting to believe that it'll happen.",

I'm like, 'That's my *wife*!'\"\n\nI said, \"I know, right?! How gross and inappropriate! *Anybody* but your *wife*!\" lmao! \n\nBest compliment ever.

I just recently turned 55 and celebrated my 26th anniversary. My Dr. has me on 6 different meds plus a few OTC meds, vitamins &amp; minerals (so between the prescription meds and OTC meds I take more than 20 pills per day.) - and I think I might strangle him if he tells me one more time \"here's a new med - &amp; btw it's going to make you gain weight\"\n\n11 days ago I weighed in at 222lbs.  My husband and I are just starting our Keto journey....but this morning when I stepped on the scale it said I was 216! - and hubby is down 5 lbs as well.  So, it's definitely working for us....still learning &amp; tweaking...but hopefully in a year or so I will be able to share similar pics to yours!  I would like to get down to about 140-150lbs...so although this journey is sometimes difficult - it will be soooo worth it!\n\nThank you, Thank you, Thank you! (&amp; keep up the amazing work!",

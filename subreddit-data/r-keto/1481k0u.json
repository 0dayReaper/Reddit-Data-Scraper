    "postText": "I'm a student trying to maximize my omega 3:6 ratio while maintaining a healthy diet all around. **I'm planning on eating broccoli(8 cups), pink salmon(pound), and ghee(12 tablespoons) exclusivley in order to achieve this.** \n\nThe main delema is that most meat I can afford has way more omega 6 than omega 3 becuase of the farming practices, this leaves me with frozen wild salmon as an only option. I have a slight alergic reaction to kale, spinach, and other leafy greens which makes it nearly impossible to eat them in large quantities without my throat burning up, which is why I resorted to eating only broccoli. I used a nutrient tracking app called cronometer and it looks like i'm getting all of the stuff I need (minus calcium but I can always supplement that). Since I don't know what I don't know, I just wanted to ask if this diet would be a problem. ",

            "comment": "8 cups of broccoli? You are going to crash your thyroid eating that much cruciferous vegetables every day, and destroy your gut. Since you already seem to have issues with vegetable greens, why do you think 8 cups of broccoli is any better?\n\nWhy not go a different route? Zucchini, other low carb squashes, avocados, cucumbers, and olives are low carb fruits so they are less likely to trigger any autoimmune response like vegetables. If you ate 2 medium/large avocados, 2 large zucchinis and 2 cucumbers every day, most of your potassium, magnesium, folate, and most other micros would be met right there. Olives are a great source of other micronutrients and minerals.  You can also peel the zucchinis and the cucumber to lessen any triggers if they arise.\n\nCan you eat shrimp? Costco sells 3 pound bags of wild caught red Argentinian shrimp for under 20 dollars, so you can backfill some protein, magnesium, potassium. selenium, and copper from shrimp without having to spend a ton of money on salmon. Wild caught Steelhead trout is another option besides salmon, it looks the same, has more omega 3 and is cheaper than salmon.  \n\nWalmart has bags of 4 large avocados for 3.29, and zucchini and cucumbers are cheap there, as well as at Aldi's and Costco.  Aldi's also runs numerous sales on blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries, I find them on sale for 1.79, 1.89, and 2.39 respectively all the time. \n\nCheese for vitamin D, calcium, vitamin K2, Vitamin A,  protein and fat.",

You do pay more per oz, but the weight lost from having to peel your own shrimp makes it less of a difference. The larger the shrimp, the more expensive it is, so I usually go with the small/medium size shrimp.",

At least you\u2019d have to go through an adjustment period in order to eat an amount that high I would think.",

    "postText": "To preface, I have hashimotos and a mood disorder, problems with alcoholism, and when I don't eat processed foods or drink regularly it helps a lot (duh). \n\nI get my thyroid tested every 6 months and take medication to keep it at a regular level. I did keto before many moons ago and it was great, I lost 40 lbs but it came back when I returned to old habits - beer and pizza, you know. \n\nI dropped the weight again after leaving my partner of 13 years, a brief manic spree and only having time for one meal a day. Usually a free personal pan pizza from wherever I was working at the time. I was struggling to rebuild everything after being financially dependent on my ex. Calories were probably way under 1000 a day with 20k steps daily. \n\nI'm more stable again now and attempting keto to help with mood and energy as well as weight loss. I'm 5'2\", 35 years old and back up to 200 lbs. I have a sedentary job now. The problem is my tdee should be like 1500, but even at 1200 kcal a day with a 30 minute walk, the scale has not budged. I have stopped drinking and I'm working outside more too. It's been two weeks. Is something wrong as far as water retention? Am I just too old to do this easily? Did I ruin my metabolism in the past? How can I fix it if I did?\n\nThanks for reading, any insight is appreciated.",

            "comment": "Hey, you said you've had a drinking habit. Maybe your liver just needs some more time to adapt and repair.  Your liver needs to produce the ketones and maybe it just needs a little bit more time.\n\nDid you test for ketones in you urine? In the beginning this measurement can help to see if ketosis is happening. I would not stress too much about it. \n\nI actually think your calories are too low, because your basal metabolic rate (for existing, breathing, doing nothing else than body functions) is above 1500 calories for your height and your current weight. You are also an active person, so your expenditure should be much higher than the 1500 calories. \n\nI would first start to watch your hunger signals and eat to satiety and not care soo much about calories, as long as you are within your carb limit.\n\nGet your levels tested for your thyroid. If you have too low hormones, nothing will happen on the scale. My mom has problems with it too. Maybe your medication needs to be adjusted, as some foods interfere with it.\n\nDrink enough water, burning fat needs water. You will actually \"breathe\" your fat out, at least a part of it as water vapor.\n\nYou are doing great! :) The results will come sooner or later. Less stress = less stored fat. :D\n\nI am not a doctor. Please see your doctor if you have any unwanted effects.",

But six months is a long time span. when it was tested recently before the diet was changed, it now has to be retested. \n\nIf measuring ketones is good or bad is a highly discussed topic in this community. I think its a good tool for control, but i do not say, that weight loss is dependent on it.",

I\u2019d highly recommend tightening up your weighing/tracking to ensure you\u2019re really at 1200 to see if that helps get things going. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb It\u2019s a pretty simple adjustment to make the next few weeks and could really make a difference. If you\u2019re at 25g carbs and 100g protein, your fat should be around 65-70g to keep it at 1200.",

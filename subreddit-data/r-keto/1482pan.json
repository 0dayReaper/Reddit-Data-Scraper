However, if you don\u2019t want to tempt yourself with adjustment foods, nuts and cheeses are a good alternative. Also, keto-friendly fruits cook up pretty well. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for meats, I recommend cubing, marinating, and roast over coals like steppe warriors did.   Kebabs are great, and you can use keto flatbread or some leafy greens (be careful, lettuce doesn\u2019t insulate well against heat).",

You could make keto cookies (my suggestion would be peanut butter with Lily's chocolate chips) with the utensil placed on some hot coals \u2014 not directly on a roaring fire.\n\n  \nYou might even be able to find a keto dough recipe (with xantham gum or flax seed meal) that's sticky enough to wrap around a stick, and then cook it like a kabob.  \nI'm about to go camping and I'm planning on keto brownies cooked in the Dutch oven suspended from a tripod I DIY'ed.\n\nBETTER IDEA: look up \"cardboard box oven\" It's a fun project for kids and you can easily bake a (keto) cake or brownies in one. I've done it multiple times with great success. Add a probe thermometer and Bob's your Uncle.",

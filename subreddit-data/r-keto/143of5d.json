    "postText": "To get enough potassium is it better or equally effective to take a supplement form of potassium, in tablet or capsule, versus using a powdered form of it (ie. Nu salt or low sodium salt) desolved in water? I'm asking because I'm getting cramps on the whole left side of my body. I'm using low sodium \"salt\" that is 60mg sodium and 450mg potassium desolved in water to get 1250-2500mg a day and I don't think I can deal with having to drink even more of that stuff every day. I'm wondering if getting a supplemental form of it will do better for me or not. I already take 200-300mg of Magnesium citrate every day in capsules. Yet I'm still getting a lot of cramps on the left side of my body from my shoulder down to my feet. It has stopped me from being able to workout because it gets worse. What else can I do to stop this cramping.\n\nI'm worried about increasing my intake of potassium by another 1000-2000mg a day because from everything I have read on \"Google\" it says that the maximum long term safe dosage is debatable between 2000-3000mg with some sourses claiming 4700mg.",

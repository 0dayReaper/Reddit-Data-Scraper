It's my first time doing strict keto, meaning no more than 25 carbs per day and eating at a calorie deficit 99% of the time. My past two attempts I did the lazy keto, eating everything which had less than 5% carbs in it, which worked to an extent. I regained my weight both times though after stopping. \n\nThis time I've stuck to it the entire time, tracking everything I eat under a microscope, and now I've reached some kind of goal. I'm getting married on saturday, and boy am I glad that my wedding pictures won't look like I'm 35 and about to die an early death. \n\nI've been blessed by having such great support during my weight loss. First of all, you guys. All of you helping each other out has truly been an inspiration and it has helped me to inspirate others with my pictures. My fianc\u00e9e has been helping out aswell. Even though she doesn't approve of my lifestyle since she's a vegan, she has supported me whole heartedly and even did some ketoing herself including a lot of tofu. \n\nThanks again /r/keto for your endless support.\n\n\nEDIT: Wedding pictures are to be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/3huccr/update_nsv_pics_coping_wedding_pictures_one_year/).",

If you notice you are slipping snap out if it instantly until it becomes a healthy habit.\n\nGood luck! Your new look suits you great, btw!",

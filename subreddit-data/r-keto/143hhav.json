    "postText": "DISCLAIMER: I know sweeteners are not a good group. They are not required or necessary in diet. \n\nI am a sugar and carb addict (an abstainer, not moderator). Carbs and sugar trigger my BED behaviors. I am not really a fan of desserts but I do like my drinks/ beverages sweet. \n\nI wonder what sweetener would you recommend for my tea or coffee? \n\nThe ones I tried include: \n\n\ud83c\udf00Erythritol-&gt; which was a total fail. I got headache after consuming it. It also caused a lot of cravings. I was hungrier after consuming it and I had to finish my fast earlier than usual. \n\n\ud83c\udf00Erythritol-stevia blend-&gt; same story here, a terrible headache, unstoppable appetite and sugar cravings. \n\n\ud83c\udf00Sodium-saccharine-&gt; I did better with this one. It didn\u2019t trigger any headache, it just caused digestive issues (diarrhea) and increased my appetite. It was better than erythritol anyway. \n\nDo you have any other options except the ones I described above? All the advices and recommendations will be highly appreciated \ud83d\udc4d",

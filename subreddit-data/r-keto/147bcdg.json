    "postText": "Hi everyone- I\u2019m about 2 weeks into keto, trying now to stay between 10-15g carbs, sometimes a little more. However, I\u2019m having a hard time with a terrible taste in my mouth that makes me want to eat to get rid of it (though that doesn\u2019t really help). I thought ketosis caused a fruity acetone like taste but this is nothing like that. I\u2019m also pretty tired and have headaches. I am supplementing electrolytes fine, I think: 2 LMNT packages a day, extra potassium, and 400mg magnesium citrate at night. Any tips? Does this go away?",

You don\u2019t need any fancy products or pills for sodium and potassium. Magnesium glycinate is very cheap on amazon to boot.\n\nThe keto flu is nothing more than electrolyte deficiency. It can happen anytime you are deficient, not just at the start. Google \u201cketoade recipes\u201d and start feeling better. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nThere\u2019s more info in the FAQ if you\u2019d like to know more:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq",

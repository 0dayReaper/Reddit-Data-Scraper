Is it the state of ketosis that brings all these health benefits people talk about, or is it the low sugar/carbs?\n\nI think, in a sense, it goes hand in hand, but I'm still very curious.\n\nWhen people talk about the mental of physical benefits they experience, it it the ketones doing this, or is it simply because they've most likely stopped eating bad foods? Maybe both?\n\nI'm interesting to hear your answers and views.\n\nThanks!",

I have learned the hard way that just because a meal is Keto, doesn\u2019t mean it is healthy. The biggest difference in health when I went Keto/low carb was that I stopped catching colds. I have young kids and was catching 2 or three colds a month for ages. I typically don\u2019t get illnesses. After a long run of doing great I did a couple of weeks eating dirty Keto, without the veg and salad. Mostly cheese and processed convenience foods. I was in ketosis but my health rapidly went to shit. It was the absence of processed food that was so beneficial. For me cutting out processed food has more benefits then ketosis itself, but Keto diet is a great tool for removing cravings and temptations.",

Probably has to do with inflammation. \n\nAlso after going keto my oral health has improved drastically. All the bad things that go on in your mouth from gum disease to cavities all come from bacteria eating sugars. That bacteria can flow to the rest of your body and create infections also. \n\nSo to answer your question I think the health benefits come from lack of carbs, but the other benefits mentally and energy comes from ketosis.",

Chronic inflammation which causes compounding issues. \n\nIf people stick to meat, veggies for the mass majority of their intake they'd be better off overall. \n\nEven if they don't stay low carb/keto as these forums, having limited breads, pastas along with meats/veggies/good fats is much, much better than boxed dinner after boxed dinner of pure trash in the body. \n\nThe move away from real foods is the biggest issue overall. Whether that results in low carb/keto or not. Most of us are going to that \"extreme\" bc of a lifetime of the trash diets.\n\nHeck...when I visit Europe, even eating bread there doesn't effect me the same.

Also, sometimes a bit of water for consistancy. Let it ferment in my gad oven with only the pilot light for at least 12 hours before baking. \n\nTrust me, best bread ever.

I figure teaching him a skill and goibg with him to sell door to door will allow him to earn money on his own for his wants or to put towards his college fund my mom  and step dad are saving for him since i cant. Lets just say im well below poverty income and he will need scholorships and tuition fee waivers to cover most of hid expenses but both me and my parents are planning togethet how to save up to cover the rest. \n\nMy son knows this, and thatd why he wants to work, to ease our financial strain and give his own monetary contribition to his future. I dont knoe many 12-13 year olds who think and plan the way he has a tendancy to do, but hes showing signs of being a even better tactical and logistocal thinker than i am, and fully capable of following through.\n\nAnywho, just thought id put my two cents in on bread and how to avoid the extra sugar and carbs, even if most here arent interested in having bread anymore like myself.\n\nWell, at least nit nirmal non keto/catnivore breaf options.",

The extra kneading once risen is to even out the air bubbles for a more even rise and air pockets.\n\nIf i eant to lower the catbs u could sub some of the flour with keto flour or ground chia/flax seeds. It would increase tge fiber, lower the carbs, but not hurt the rise much if at all. It wpukd make it a more keto friendky bread. The original recipe is not keto freindly at all, but i guess woukd be fine for a treat meal every now and then or tp give to lovrd ones who arent doing keto but want healthier iptions than usual store bought crap.\n\nU could also always add protien powder in a lowet carb option along with keto flour and chia/flax seeds in place of wheat if u want it to rise right im sure. Or use things like psylkiam or oat fiber so it looks and acts like normal flour while bring a 100% keto version of sourdough without regular flour",

Some of how he kearned rhis was not from my positive infkuence unfirtunatly.\n\nIm mentally disabled, on ssi and foodstamps, medicaid, public housing, etc. Im beyond dirt poor and dont hide it. Though being so poor and unablr to work it allows me to be a home maker and a artist , and take time to kearn useful skills to provide ranging from gardening and cooking to foraging and scavaging and repourposing or selking scavanged items.\n\nThat said, my mom is a narcisstic sociopath raised by even worse parents who were rich white socialites in thr houston area in the 60s. She is toxic, but although i can stand her, and barely tolerate her, she is sometimes capable of doing positive things or being right about things as much as i hate to admit it. She actually was able to work her way tgrough college so knows how expensive that was back in tge 70s and 80s. I couldnt make it through my badics myself because im not very compatoble with achedemics. Though i also remember how expensive it was in 2005, and know full well tuition fee waivers, svholarships, and fibancial aid likely wont cover more than tuition and supplies. It wont covet bills, food, house expenses, or fun money to allow work life balance .\n\nSo both me and my mom agree that since she and my step dad are better off that they are doing tge college fund the best they can. Im teaching him skills to have his budget in line and how to cook for himself well balanced budget freindly meals instead of living off ramens and mav n cheese. \n\nAnd, ive explained how important it is to really plan for his finances. Tge pros and cons of different scholoarships depending on what they do cover, hoe sometimes he can get and accept more than one. Also the pros and cons of fraternities considering his career goals. On that one i advised not joining in his freshman year so he can observe and be more selective if he oots to jion any to avoid joining one thats unsafe.\n\nHis want to pull his weight stems not only from me, but watching the dynamic between my mom and step dad as well as observing the toxiv and abusive relationship i had with hus father that included me and my son as a toddler doing street vending and door to door sales to affird shelter and pull ups/house hold and baby needs whikr his father sat on his ass gettibg high and drunk. My son was my buisness buddy/hipe man. He actually made a point of helping to increase sales by being a cute little toddker boy drawing customers by playing , or when customers were looking, hed pick stuff up and show it off and say \"look, pretty \" much to both my amusememt and annoyance since id havr to fux my display. \n\nAt age 3, my son undrstood the money mommy was trying tp earn was for him and our family since usualky afyet i packed up id go to the nearest store to buy things like wipes, pull ups, or choc/strawberry milk or juice for him as well as things like tp, dish soap, hygene stuff, or food for the whoke family. He was with me for this.\n\nMy child saw mommy finds ways to work and support the family, but daddy doesnt. Mommys trying very hard but is struggling, so i want to help mommy unlike daddy.\n\nI think seeing that for years taught him the importance of collective effort to support each other and how if one person refuses to pull their weight how the otgers start drwoning to cover the slack . He doesnt want soneone to cover his slack so he insists on carrying his own weight and then some despite my protests. Though i do appreciate his kind and helpful nature with me. Hes a lot less helpful witb my mom, but i completly undrrstand since i dont like her either. \n\nMy son is more than willing to help and respect those who help and respect him. Since ive always taught him respect, loyalty, and trust are earned not given he majes a point of abiding by that concept . I also taught him the importance of brutal honesty but tact. And not to mention im teaching him the importance of choosing his battles wisely and cya.\n\nI may be the positive teacher, but bad experiences and crap infkuences aided in their iwn way for him as well. I had in my life far more negative infkuences teaching me thsn positive, and im teaching him the lessons and skills i learned through more positive means.\n\nTjnx for the climemt though . I will say im quite proud of him, but hid actions and choices are his own. He often makes plans and impliments them or starts to and onky infirms me later. And his tactics and stratagys thouroughly impress me, especially with his age. I just add extra stuff and advise on the littke extra bits and bond to aid in his already laid out plans more tgan anything else.",

And i was in more than 1 abusive placements. One was so bad that they eventually got shut diwn because they physically tortured a 16 yr old to death. I spent over a year at my dons age there. \n\nI appreciate the support and empathy. As bad as my life has been, it taught me a lot and i came out in some eays better and stronger for it.\n\nAs baf as my 10 years with my ex were, and all tge regrets i have from it, i still got some good from it including my son . The events of his conception revolvrd around lies and coersion from my ex who is 16 yrs older than me so far from ideal. \n\nStill while i regret my sons father i adore my boy and woukdnt trade him for anything . Im proud of the man hesgriwing to be, and if my ex was even half the man my soon to be 13 yr old son was, id probably still be with him. Sad a 53 yr old man is less mature and less of a man than his tween son or soon to be 37 yr old ex so. \n\n\nLife deals everyone a hand if cards in life, its hoe u play them that matters. In poker ashit hand if played correctly can still win tge pot whike a great hand can still lose if played incorrectly.\n\nRome wasnt built in a day and nothing worthwhike comes easy. Though rome was burnt to the ground in a single night Through one mans arrogance and greed and incompetance ad a leader . Anything built can easily be destroyed, but tajes a lot of hard work to maintain and prosper from, even things like freindships, love, trust, marriage , etc. But that hard work leads to positive things, not all monitary.\n\n\nBut yeah, thnx for ur kindness. Life and people in general have never really been all that kind to me, but it taught mr a lot and i grew from every experience , both negatove and positive.",

First, there's no money in this being accurate because there's no pill to sell afterwards, so there's a much lower incentive to do a trial\n\nSecond, when they get around to doing trials, they don't \"force\" the diet on people. They just give them instructions on how to do it and record the results whether they quit or not. It's why almost all of the studies you find will tell you that the keto group lost an average of like 5 pounds over a year. This is insane because we all know you lose 5 pounds in the first week and then a pound or two each week after, as long as you're keeping up. In all of these studies they point out that barely anybody stuck with it, which is helpful to point out that it's hard for the average person to stick with, but is not helpful to find out the actual benefits of sticking with it.",

They kept the kids' weight stable - so if their weight went down one day, they had them eat more - which showed the harm being done by the sugars and highly processed foods irrespective of weight.

It played a key role in finding an eventual diagnosis...  From my own subjective experience I'm confident that chronic inflammation is a misunderstood and deeply underestimated factor in our current collective health.\n\nTo me, it's just bonkers.  I started keto on a lark, for the reasons of Elk Meat, DMT, and a vague desire to not be a big fat sack of shit \nany more.  I'm no zealot.  But then, suddenly, I was seeing very unexpected improvements in migraines and seemingly intractable  muscle &amp; nerve dysfunctions. \n\nSo now I live in a world where I occasionally have to explain the role of inflammation to healthcare providers who struggle to process how much I've improved, while also eating shit on Reddit regularly for suggesting that anti-inflammatory diets might maybe sometimes help with problems that mostly relate to inflammation.\n\nOnce the data, models, and funding fall into place?  We grew up on the wrong side of history. \"*In olden times people used to use leeches to drain blood, prescribe cocaine for sleeplessness, and thought that a 24/7 sugar buzz was healthy... Lul!*\"",

Here is the full process: \nImmediately after a meal, blood sugar rises. \n3 hours blood sugar drops.\n9 hours blood sugar level settles down.\n11 hours after a meal, fat-burning begins. \n14 hours, Ketones are produced by liver as a by-product of burning fat (ketosis) \n16 hours Autophagy begins. Old cell components and proteins are recycled. \n\nI think both ketosis and the lack of sugar have big health benefits. But you need to have zero carbs/sugar for 14 hours to get into ketosis. note you don\u2019t have to fast to get into ketosis, it\u2019s just one way to go about it. And you don\u2019t need to get into ketosis to lower carbs or sugar. However, you are more likely to see greater benefits faster with ketosis simply because having zero sugar is a lot more effective than having \u201ca little less than normal\u201d. Plus it\u2019s not just a dessert after dinner\u2014 there is hidden sugar in literally everything in America. So fasting ensures that there\u2019s no way you could be accidentally ingesting more sugar than you realize. \n\nA lot of people report other positive side effects with both ketosis and autophagy (or long fasts) such as clearer mind, more energy, and less cravings.\nThat being said, you\u2019ll still feel a bit better with any healthy lifestyle change, no matter how small!",

Another benefit that seems tied directly to low carb is that my dental health is way better (my teeth feel clean for much longer after brushing).\n\nWeight loss is definitely a function of CICO and my view is that keto is a great way to stay in budget, but does not cause weight loss in and of itself.",

That is one set of benefits, even without keytosis or fasting involved.\n\nFasting stabalizes hormones including insulin which can hrlp a lot of metabolic issues and if u do extenedc fadts from time to time, 18+ hours, to get autophogy, u can heal cell damage, mitochondrial dna damage , and overall cell damage by tge effects of autophogy fircibg the replacement or recycling of damaged cells in the body. This also helps lower inflammation. This is seperate from low carb dieys and keytosis.\n\nNow, keytosis is from having glusose low enough the body prioritizes fat over glucose as fuel. This also helps with all the stuff above but can be achieved through either method seperatly or in tandem. Also, since its hekps with these factors it helps prevent or treat cancer, helps with conditions like epilepsy, mental illness, diabetes, autoimmune conditions, etc, etc.\n\n\nCombine all three and they all play into each other to amplify benefits. \n\n\nHope this helos op.",

Carbs and other processed food (seed oils, etc...) that don't match our evolutionary high fat animal diet create inflammation, oxidization, and work against our hormonal system. \n\nWe developed the ability to use carbs for energy as an anti-starvation method. I don't think we were ever meant to have unlimited carbs every single day like most people eat not. We were probably meant to eat mostly fat and meat and be in ketosis for a good deal of the time.",

When glucose enters the bloodstream it is foisted off on the brain and the skeletal muscles first because they use most of the energy required by the human body. Glucose is short term fuel, so it makes sense to send it where it will be consumed first. The excess that can\u2019t be used short term is packed away as fat, to be made into ketones later. The brain may function quite well on both, but ketones are likely the default setting for metabolism. We are not evolved to have a ready and endless supply of carbs.",

It takes more energy to break down carbs than fat, so you're basically constantly putting your body in a state of rollercoastering through its energy levels by getting the \"rush\" of carbohydrates only to come down later. Ketosis, using fat for energy rather than carbs, is much more \"slow release\" in terms of the energy it brings. Carbs are like Adderall and ketones are like Vyvanse; you've got some buffer slowing down the release so you don't just hit the wall full force.",

You raise that level by restricting carbs, and raise it further by fasting completely. \n\nI imagine the health benefits depend on the individual. If you're insulin resistant/carb sensitive, reducing carbs is going to significantly improve your health regardless of whether the carbs you were eating were like, natural whole foods as opposed to refined sugars.

It isn't an on / off switch. Here have some info:\n\nhttps://keto-mojo.com/article/testing-what-should-ketone-levels-be/\n\n&gt;Understanding Ketone Levels\nSo what level of ketones indicates ketosis? When discussing ketone levels/levels of ketosis, keto experts often cite The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living and The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Performance, by Stephen Phinney, MD, PhD and Jeff Volek, PhD, RD. They suggest nutritional ketosis begins at molecular concentration levels of 0.5 mmol/L. That means that the minute you cross that 0.5 threshold, you\u2019re \u201cin ketosis.\u201d From there, nutritional ketosis is considered \u201clight\u201d through 1.0 mmol/L (light is still good!), then becomes \u201coptimal\u201d in the 1.0 mmol/L through 3.0 mmol/L range. But if you look at the graph below, there is nuance within these ketone zones.\n\n&gt;So, how do you know what ketone level to aim for? It depends upon your goals. The optimal ketone level will be different if your goal is to lose weight than it is if you want to prevent illness, improve mental clarity, or become more physically fit. \n\n&gt;What Should Your Ketone Level Be?\nIf your primary goal for integrating the ketogenic diet into your life is weight loss, achieving \u201clight nutritional ketosis,\u201d or 0.5 mmol/L-1.0 mmol/L, is a good starting point. From there, aim for \u201coptimal ketosis,\u201d which is when your ketone levels are between 1.0 mmol/L-3.0 mmol/L. People looking to use the ketogenic diet for therapeutic benefits for medical conditions such as epilepsy, cancer, or endocrine and metabolic disorders, are generally directed to aim for much higher ketone levels\u2014specifically in the 3.0 mmol/L -5.0 mmol/L range, or somewhere between. Those who are fasting or eat a much higher fat-to-protein ratio will look to levels in the 3.0 mmol/L-8.0 mmol/L range. But you don\u2019t need to go there. The optimal ketosis range is called \u201coptimal\u201d for a reason, and it\u2019s exactly where you\u2019ll want to be for weight-loss and general health purposes, and you\u2019ll eventually get there if you practice patience and get in the groove of eating a keto diet.",

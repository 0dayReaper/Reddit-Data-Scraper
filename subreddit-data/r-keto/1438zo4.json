    "postText": "Guys is keto good for cutting and losing weight? I am now 85kg and I aim to be at 70kg... I am thinking of doing keto... Is it good for losing weight? I am thinking 3 keto meals a day... I was also thinking of doing omad but it's not sustainable as I will feel hungry always and won't have the energy to work out... So it's 3 keto meals a day... What's your opinion? \n\nThanks",

            "comment": "Ketos main selling point is weight loss but what gets overshadowed are the other (better) side effects,. Better mental health, no more feeling hungry.\n\nSince doing Keto I fasted for 3 days, this is extreme of course but I wanted to try it and it was possible as keto just suppressed my hunger to the point it wasn't ever painful.\n\nOMAD is entirely possible, this 3 meal a day mentality is just that, it's a mentality. So long as you get the amount of calories you want/need in a day, it doesn't matter if it's 12 small meals or 1 big one. There are obviously benefits to OMAD over the 12 meals as you'll be fasting for 23 hours a day, but this is a whole other conversation.\n\nYou can cut on keto, bulk on keto, maintain on keto the same as you can on any diet, calories in Vs calories out (simplified definition of course)\n\nI assume you're a starter? I've been helping family members and this is how I've helped them lose weight by just switching to keto...\n\nEat when you're hungry, whatever you want, just watch the carbs, keep them as close to 0 as possible. Do this for a week and then after this, start to calorie count and weigh your food, don't rush, if you're not ready to reduce calories to your goal deficit, just count and weigh the food for another week, this gets you used to how many calories are in what and what you can reduce to achieve your goal, of you go too fast and aren't having fun, you'll bail.\n\nFind your BMR (the amount of calories you burn if you just laid in bed all day) and either use that as your calorie total or reduce it by 200. By week 3-4 your appetite will (should) be far less than it was pre keto, keep on track with your BMR as this will change as you lose weight, but also try weigh yourself every day and on every Sunday, work out the average, that's how much you weigh, don't use daily numbers to determine your weight as it fluctuates too much.\n\nJust to give some substance to my advice:\n\nI have a protein shake then go for a 3 mile walk in the morning.\n\nI'll have an omelette around noon, depending on my hunger levels (it's more common that I don't have this)\n\nI eat around 5pm\n\nAt roughly 7pm I go to the gym every day for over an hour lifting weights, followed by a 30 min swim.\n\nI'll then have casein protein shake and a handful of peanuts before bed.\n\nI started at 94ish Kg, I went to 86kg in a few months but as I'm training I'm upping my calories and obviously weighing more due to the muscle size and I'm now just shy of 90kg (I'm aiming for around 100kg) I'm still a bit flabby but it's going down as my weight goes up due to the muscles.\n\nI'm also doing this with my girlfriend and she has been successful too, she doesn't do the morning walk and always has lunch but has had similar success towards her goals. Good luck, I've got faith in you.\n\nTLDR: Yes, it is \ud83e\udd2a (and take creatine)",

Prior to my wedding photos, I decided to cut because I wanted to be in my best physique for photoshoots and everything.  Once in a life time.\n\nEvery morning I wake up, I step on the scale and document my entire cut progress.  It was on point.  I kept my workout the same, pushed myself harder than when I\u2019m bulking to try to minimise muscle loss, and that worked for a while, but eventually I was forced to lower my weights for all my lifts.\n\nEveryday I look in the mirror, the striations became more defined. \n\nHowever, the keto diet was way too effective for my cut, my body fat % dropped to single digit.  I looked incredibly small in clothes, especially in a full suit.\n\nSo all my wedding photos and the photos of me on my wedding day was me looking very small and skinny.  \n\nKeto works \ud83d\ude09, way too effective.",

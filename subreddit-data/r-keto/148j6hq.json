    "postText": "I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 2 /12 months ago. I was feeling absolutely horrible at home and didn\u2019t know what was going on, I thought maybe I had the flu, or a virus. Finally I was admitted to the ER and then the ICU with ketoacidosis. The ER doctor told me I had type 1 diabetes, which sent me through a rabbit hole of emotions and stress. Fast forward a week or so later and my family doctor runs some tests, and confirms I\u2019m actually type 2, which the hospital I was in documented as such, but the doctor I seen initially assumed I was type 1 based on the ketoacidosis. \n\nAnywho, upon release from the hospital, I was taking five shots of insulin a day. 30 Units of lantus in the morning and night before bed, on top of 3, 10 unit shots of Humalog before every meal. \n\nI was absolutely miserable the first week out of the hospital. Not only because of the emotional rollercoaster I was on (I believed I was type 1 for a whole week until seeing my doctor and confirming through documents at the hospital and additional bloodwork that I was in fact type 2!), but also because of the extreme fatigue I was feeling after every meal (doc says I was taking too much humalog so recommend I stop taking it if my sugar is below 150). \n\nSo anywho I began eating a keto diet and my numbers have dropped dramatically. I went into the hospital with a blood sugar of 300 and since starting this new lifestyle it rarely goes over 100. It stays between 75-95. I went from taking 5 shots a day to only 2, being my lantus in the morning and evening and even that has been reduced from 30 units per shot now down to 12 and soon to be ten and eventually my doctor wants me off insulin altogether, oh and I\u2019ve lost 20 pounds already! \n\nAnyone who has diabetes and is thinking of trying keto definitely should! It has changed my life and outlook on this disease and it\u2019s very inspiring to read other persons experiences with this as well!",

The healing journey will take longer than that. I have essentially normal blood sugars on half dose of my last medication (I was on 4 at one point). \n\nAlso, because you\u2019re taking insulin you need to discuss a bit more aggressive deprescribing plan with your doctor and be prepared to treat lows when they happen. Since you\u2019re taking basal insulin your lows could be sustained for long periods. Were I you I would discuss coming off insulin sooner, being higher because the risks of lows are life threatening and treating sustained lows means you will break a ketogenic diet.",

And their response to carbs doesn\u2019t change after a few months or even years after starting a ketogenic diet.  I have no evidence, other than the Virta study to back this, but it\u2019s a reasonable conclusion. And Virta\u2019s multi-year data sees people increasing carbs and also higher A1Cs. \n\nSo speculating on my own experience as a diabetic 23+ years post diagnosis that I would probably need to be keto for as long as I was diagnosed plus some undetermined period that includes how long I was diabetic and how long my insulin resistance had been high. Speculating that this is at least 30 years for me. So for life. I was recently served a pop that wasn\u2019t diet, despite ordering it. I drank about 16 oz of it. I went from 100 to 250. Took 3 hours to go back to 120, even after 30 minutes of hiking, and I stayed at close to 120 that day and much of the next. \n\nRegarding my medication, I could likely go off of it, but it\u2019s a bit of a compromise with my doctor because he wants me on a statin and I take an SGLT2 inhibitor which studies have shown have a stronger protective factor for CVD risks.",

Autophagy is more a preventative than a silver bullet.  Eg, if you lose a foot to diabetes autophagy isn't going to grow it back.\n\nAutophagy can repair some of the damage, and if you're lucky it will repair all of the damage, even beta cells.  After that there is nothing known further to science to heal.  Some people are lucky and after a few prolonged fasts to induce autophagy their diabetes is reversed, but the majority have to stay on a low carb diet for life.\n\nAlso, keep in mind reversed is not invulnerability.  It means one can have a healthy amount of carbs without progressive damage.  One with type 2 who isn't healed, any fructose they eat will (sugar is 50% fructose) will slowly damage their body over the years.  One who has reversed type 2 from autophagy can have mild amounts of fructose without their eyesight going or any other negative progressive symptoms.",

The hospital diabetic meal is LFHC. The answer is so obvious. You can try something called eating to your meter. Basically testing pre meal and at 30, 60, and 90-120 minutes post meal to see how  the body responds to foods. It\u2019s very eye opening. If you are on FB at all there are sone good T2/strict keto groups. Also, Dr. Richard Bernstein\u2019s (he\u2019s T1 but treats T1 and T2) book Diabetes Solution or YouTube Diabetes University is informative. He has a great story as well.",

Not all insulin resistance is t2 diabetes or will get t2 diabetes.\n\nIf you take meds that cause insulin resistance or are severely morbidly obese and insulin resistant to t2 numbers and you stop taking the meds or lose all the weight and your insulin resistance is gone was the problem insulin resistance or t2?  T2 is not insulin resistance or it would be called insulin resistance.\n\nThinking of remission as diet controlled is not helpful to me as a diabetic. I dont need to be told I will always be a diabetic to know that my diabetic numbers can come back if I gain weight, I can eat carbs without the numbers spiking, what I cant do is gain 80lbs and take fistfuls of psych meds that cause insulin resistance and increase risk of diabetes by 400%. Its just using fearful language to control people you think are dumb instead of straight up telling them the risk and letting them live with the consequences which they will do anyways.  Diabetes is currently both known to be a progressive disease and no longer a progressive disease because remission is not well understood.  Some cannot put it into remission with weight loss/diet and exercise so where does that leave them?   Imo it's better to say diabetes cannot be cured and diagnose a person who can achieve the higher end of remission/extended remission/reversal with insulin resistance or prediabetes and wait to diagnose them with diabetes until they cannot improve without medication or change the diagnosis if they can pass an ogtt.\n\nA lot of people in remission can pass a glucose tolerance test and they've stated so on the t2 sub, I bet I can.  Yet even if I could that would not make me \"no longer a diabetic\". At the end of the day I dont want to be lumped in with the people who actually have diabetic a1cs or manage with meds because its demoralizing and makes me feel like its pointless I am at the mercy of the stats and have no real knowledge about what my outcome will actually look like the cuz the stats are all skewed by people who do nothing to improve their lifestyle.  It also means because of guidelines and risk factors doctors will try to put me on statins just because of that diabetes status since they feel diabetics should have an ldl below 2 vs a normal person who is allowed an ldl of 3.  Yet the same doctors will tell me I have no added risks to diabetic complications.  Make that make sense.\n\nIt's like telling someone that has been obese they will always have obesity even though they're no longer obese because the likelyhood of it coming back is there due to past habits when really they have a lower bf% than someone who has never been obese.  I see it as a punishment not a fact and based on your statement you do as well as you see it as keeping them from hurting themselves.",

I see that you're processing this in a way that you feel is best for your mental health and understanding of the disease, but your semantics are at odds how most people and science approaches the situation. I'm glad it works for you; it's not how I would recommend approaching the conversation with other people. \n\nAnd yes, I do understand that remission, etc. need a lot more scientific study. But moralizing the disease (as opposed to the actions that people take) isn't good, it doesn't help people manage their disease whether they are still dealing with it, in remission, or cured. The disease (any disease - Type II, cancer, obesity, high blood pressure, whatever) is a diagnosis. There are certainly diseases where your personal actions led to diagnosis, but there are plenty of diseases where your actions did not, so moralizing diagnoses is a dangerous game. Keep the 'moralizing' and focus on actions and choices that you can control and make, and less about how you acknowledge and discuss a diagnosis.",

There isnt even an agreed upon number around the world of what prediabetes is and diabetes is determined to be a 6.5% a1c because that's when diabetic retinopathy can start- my blood vessels in my eyes are extremely healthy and people have reversed the damage they have done with remission as well.\n\nYour whole take is that I am moralizing the disease when I believe it's been moralized to keep the understanding of how it works the same as things are changing with knowledge about the disease.  It is not ME who is moralizing it its BEEN moralized and I dont like that it's been moralized because it negatively impacts my care. The person I replied to believes we should still be called diabetics no matter what because we need to know it can come back.  That's like telling someone who is cancer free they still have cancer yet after 5 years of remission doctors can say you're cured.\n\nI'm giving actual reasons and arguements based on how its diagnosed and what has changed and the replies are telling me I'm moralizing it or that it just \"needs\" to happen.  A person with a diagnosis of t2 diabetes who loses 400lbs may never see diabetes in their life again no matter what they eat as long as they dont regain weight, their a1c could be better than someone who has never had diabetes and will never get it.  Or maybe that non diabetic gets it at 250lbs and never gets close.  So what does that mean? \n\nAgain I made the point that t2 diabetics are recommended to have their ldl at 2 which doesnt change when you are in remission so should I be held to the same standards as a person with an a1c if 9 who doesnt or cant control their diabetes?  Should I be told that I'm at a 65% chance of dying of heart disease when my a1c is 5.2?  Should i be told that if diagnosed at 50 (I was diagnosed at 38) an average of 6 years is taken off my life?  Should I be told it's all genetics when genetics only determines WHEN you get it?  Do you believe not everyone can get t2?  I would not have been diagnosed with t2 diabetes had I not been binge eating, morbidly obese and taking all those meds either until much later or even at all.  Had I been an average weight or even overweight I wouldnt have it at all like my non diabetic family members.  I have met someone who was freshly diagnosed at 700lbs.  If I can eat what I want and eat like a normal person (someone who isnt constantly gaining weight) and my a1c is lower than some non diabetics then how is that diabetic?  What if I was born with a better functioning pancreas than some non diabetics I just burnt it out like a lawnmower on for 12 hours on a hot day so even if I regained less function I still have better function than some of them?   It just means i know i have a genetic predisposition to have diabetes at a certain point and it will get worse with age like everyone else.  \n\nMy issue with the diagnosis is that no one can answer my questions they just insist it's a moral issue to \"protect\" people like me who they think will magically stop maintaining their a1c.  You have got it wrong I am challenging the moral issue.",

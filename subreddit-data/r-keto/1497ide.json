    "postText": "I've been on Keto since September. I've lost 25 pounds and since working out I'm sure added a few pounds of muscle. \n\nThere were many motivations. Prior I binge ate and ate out a lot. There are so many reasons for the change that are too long to list but ultimately my wife tried it and lost 7 pounds and then trailed off. \n\nI've been staying strong. So strong in fact I only cheated twice (2 bites of cheesechake ONE time) and the other eating a non-keto cookie (protein instead) that I thought was Keto. \n\nThe reason for this post is have you ever felt criticized for being on Keto or just a restrictive diet in general. I've had some off putting comments from my wife's side of the family and as well as some co workers. \n\nWhat's odd is they see my success. Again I'm 25 pounds leaner.  But when I eat regularly and see I still eat but not divulge in everything that is available (eat a cheeseburger with the cheese and burger but not with a bun). They can't help themselves. \n\nIt's almost like they are envious. Food was my crutch in the past. I stress ate. Now that is far behind me I have very little cravings. I wanted to prove to myself I could have the discipline to diet and then move onto fitness which I have done for about 3 weeks now.  \n\nWhy can't people just stay in their lane and keep their comments to themselves. I feel like sometimes people think I have an eating disorder and that I'm there to size them up and make them question their meal choices. \n\nThat is what they feel but that is not my intent. They always are the first to bring it up and then if people that don't know about my diet start to ask questions I engage but I don't boast. I don't have the menality that someone that isn't on Keto is wrong and I am right.\n\nI just want to left alone and continue on my journey. Has anyone had similar experiences?",

Someone's diet is the most boring topic I can think of for polite society, so I'll change topics asap.\n\nIf someone really seems interested, I'll mention that 20 years ago I was morbidly obese and prediabetic, and skipping carbs is the main reason I've never regained the weight.",

I think a lot of it is guilt.. that the person wishes they were eating better, or that I'm somehow judging them. My mom for example said some pretty judgmental things when I visited. For her I told her my truth, I have a food addiction, I've had it my whole life (funny that those closest to us don't really know us sometimes). I'm a binge eater, but I never ate much around people, I ate secretly.  My husband said once, while I was upset about my weight, \u201cI don't understand, you never eat.\u201d I did finally open up to him about my private eating, like waiting for him to go to bed so I could stuff myself. \nI've battled weight my whole life gaining and losing massive amounts of weight. \nSomehow this fact gets lost on the people around me, and they feel the need to say things like \u201cdieting isn't healthy\u201d \u201cI could never do that,\u201d or \u201cmoderation is the key\u201d\n\nFor the people that I'm not close to, I never mention Keto because I don't want to correct their often misinformation about it. \n\n I just say I'm cutting out bread and sugar for the time being\n\nI then grab a piece of cheese and eat it which seems to put them at ease because cheese is a no-no for so many\ud83d\ude01",

You know what else is unhealthy? Excess body fat. It literally shortens your life more than not eat bread does \u2026\n\nSome advice for you:\n\n1) Don\u2019t tell anyone you\u2019re on keto. If you\u2019re at a restaurant or at dinner with ppl, just decline the potatoes and bread. And most likely the dessert \u2026\n\n2) \u201cit\u2019s been working for me\u201d \u201cmy doctor says it\u2019s perfectly healthy\u201d \u201cmy blood work is actually better than ever\u201d are good replies if the convo goes that way\n\n3) Remember ppl are jealous of success, and most likely because they failed at their diet (just keep that to yourself \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t mention that to the family\u2026)\n\n4) keto works like every other diet in the world: reduce your calories below what you need and burn some body fat for fuel. The main difference is that you are constantly in the \u201cfat burning\u201d state instead of switching from glucose-burning to fat-burning.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t get into arguments using the above \u2b06\ufe0f points, more like \u201cthings to dwell on privately\u201d\n\nJust check in with your doctor every two months and stop using \u201cketo\u201d in public \u2026 and you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nGood luck \ud83d\ude09",

I don't know if the critism is just a function of human nature or if praising you would require some self awareness that their habits are not healthly. \n\nKeto has independent benefits, but I've come to view it as a way to skip the filler foods (bread/pasta/rice/potatoes) and focus on the enjoyable parts of my meals (meat/cheese/veggies). \n\nHonestly though, you can just tell them you're happier because you're healthier and leave it at that.",

You are actually doing something that is successful but it's not what they are doing. That leads to two reactions...\n\nSome people will be honestly interested and willing to try something different.\n\nMost people are \"eating healthy\" and happy with how they eat, so keto is a challenge.  Making fun of what you eat is a **defense mechanism** and it's a lot easier then thinking about what they are currently eating might not actually be healthy. \n\nExpect that as you lose more weight you will get people telling you that  you are \"getting too thin\". It's the same thing. \n\nSome people choose to just ignore it. \n\nSome people choose to say they are cutting down on sugars, which doesn't trigger people the same way \"keto does\". \n\nSome people say that can't eat sugars or starches because of a medical condition. \n\nSome people get aggressive. \"Are we talking about other people's diets now?

The problem is folks have a default setting in their brain where the meme becomes the reality and they don't actually know what folks are eating.\n\nIf I tell someone I do Keto, most folks imagine I'm in some kind of a sexual relationship with bacon and drink a jug of egg yolks 3 times daily. I joke but the way people perceive Keto is it's a diet of processed meats and fats and no vegetables at all.\n\n***Most of the comments, in my experience, come from people who assume I'm on the most extreme caricature of a keto diet possible.***\n\nMeanwhile, the average Keto follower may have a grass fed steak cooked in butter with a side of broccoli or spinach and people don't realize that's also Keto. Same is true of a 3 egg scramble in the morning with added butter or olive oil. That's a normal thing people eat and it's keto. It just doesn't click in their heads that it's keto until you point that out.\n\n**It's like how people picture \"Vegan\" and think it's all kale and tofu.** Meanwhile they can eat French fries fried in plant oils and drink beer and eat oreos and egg free pasta and so on. \n\nYou're not doing anything wrong.

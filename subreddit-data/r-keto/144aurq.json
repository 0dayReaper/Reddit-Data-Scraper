    "postText": "So this keto journey is the third time I've been successful at burning my body fat since I put it on postpartum a decade ago. There was water fasting for about 20 days in 2016, and low carb with IF for about 11 weeks last year. Both of those times I burned body fat and maybe liver fat as I'm doing now, but of course neither of them were as sustainable for me as keto is proving to be.\n\nThere has been a common theme running through all three of them though: itchy shins. From my ankle up to my mid shin is crazy itchy. Both legs. All three experiences.\n\nWhen you Google itchy shins Google returns results about diabetes and high blood glucose causing itchiness. I am diabetic but I no longer have high blood glucose and I do not have the diabetic skin condition on my shins that some diabetics have. I also wasn't diabetic in 2016. Other answers on Google suggest poor circulation but I walk 15 to 20 miles a week so I don't think it would be that.\n\nSome years ago I had read someone's comment somewhere that it might be that people with metabolic disorders,  fat in and around the organs, and unhealthy eating patterns, don't clear out pesticides from their foods as efficiently as healthy people, and so as a protection mechanism, those things get stored in fat cells so that we can keep going. When one burns the fat, those chemicals are now in the bloodstream and that's what causes the itchiness.\n\nI don't know if this is science or quackery. But three fat burns and three sets of itchy shins has me questioning things.\n\nAny experiences?",

I believe I'm most people because I'm really lucky to be able to prepare and eat whole foods. So I have no doubt I'm meeting and surpassing the 1000mg potassium and 300mg magnesium guidelines and I may a bit behind on the 5000mg sodium guidelines. I don't experience any symptoms of keto flu however; no weakness, no inability to concentrate. My athletic performance is also excellent. So in the absence of those identifiable symptoms, are itchy shins a known symptom of slight sodium deficiency?",

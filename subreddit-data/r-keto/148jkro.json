I couldn\u2019t even see past it as I stood naked and looked down towards my feet. Now after six weeks I\u2019m beginning to feel and look so much better. I have lost 17 pounds and I really don\u2019t know how many inches, but I can see my feet now.",

It\u2019s all about the amount for me - monk fruit is *really* sweet to me so I tend to naturally self limit. Some people have otherwise keto friendly foods that they can\u2019t stop eating, often salted nuts for example. I also don\u2019t eat treats regularly enough for it to stall my fat loss. \n\nI guess it\u2019s a matter of how much / how often you eat them that would cause stalls or gains. \n\nAs a side note, I used to be the person who baked sweet carby things and brought them into my workplace. When I first started keto I brought some keto baked treats in and was finally able to include a few coworkers who were diabetic. The non-diabetic people couldn\u2019t tell the difference!",

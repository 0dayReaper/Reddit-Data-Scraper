Glycogen is produced from carbs, so by not giving our bodies carbs, it adapts and uses more fat. It's kind of hard to do because carbs are everywhere and delicious. \n\nI lost 170 lbs by eating less calories, I'm trying to lose my last 20 lbs by implementing keto. ",

I made taco meat at home, with guac and salsa, and instead of tortillas I used lettuce. Same thing with homemade carnitas. \n\nGround beef is as universal as chicken is. Ground beef with some seasonings, along with julienne peppers and onion, and you've got \"poor man's pepper steak\" that you can top with cheese to get your fat. \n\nChicken breasts with broccoli and cheddar cheese, with cauliflower rice. \n\nSlow cook some pork or some chicken and make your own BBQ sauce and you've got a great BBQ dish. \n\nIf you're out and about, you can drop by Hooters and get their boneless wings without breading, so you don't have to worry about not getting a lunch if you forgot to brown bag it. Same thing with Jimmy Johns, you can get their sandwich in a lettuce wrap. \n\nOf course you can bake chicken, do steak, ka-bobs, all that wonderful stuff. And there are hundreds if not thousands of recipes you can find that are gluten-free that you can tweak to fit keto by eliminating one or two ingredients and subbing for something else. \n\nBreakfast? Get yourself some radishes, dice them up, and saute them in butter with some onions. A fantastic hashbrown replacement for your morning meal. \n\nHonestly, there's a ton of things, and you don't miss the sweets or the starches anymore. Learn how to make your own beef jerky and you're golden for a movie night, when everyone else is munching on popcorn. ",

So I'm only really eating meat and cheese in various forms. I just don't get bored with food very easily. In June-July I ate the same thing every day for about 40 days. The only reason I stopped was I had a wedding to go to.\n\nBut that's just me. There are a ton of awesome low carb recipe sites out there that have all sorts of crazy things to make. Some of my favorites are: [IBreathImHungry](http://www.ibreatheimhungry.com/), [Caveman Keto](http://cavemanketo.com/), and [Up Late Anyway.](http://uplateanyway.com/keto/) Whatever you are looking for you will no doubt be able to find it on one of those sites.\n\nAlso if you need bread there is an awesome recipe for a low carb bread. You can use for pretty much anything. It's called Alison Bread, and it is so simple to make and amazing. I've used it to make pizza dough, burger buns, cinnamon rolls, and french toast. You can find it here: [Ketoincognito.](http://ketoincognito.wordpress.com/2014/04/15/and-alison-said-let-there-be-bread-and-then-there-was-bread-and-it-was-good/) A lot of the alternate recipes for it are in the comments.",

That's precisely what it is. \n\nThe great thing is there are some days where you just don't eat, because you weren't hungry. It's 9pm at night, you're getting stuff ready for tomorrow, and you're like \"oh, hey... I didn't eat today. Cool.\" and you just chalk it up as an IF day. The next day you might want to eat a little more than usual, just to make sure you don't get any nutrient deficiencies, but overall it's a bonus. It's a great way to run into a massive calorie deficit for the week when you skip a day of intake, and you still burn your (average) 2000 - 3000 calories a day doing normal stuff. ",

I just didn't feel like eating that stuff anymore. \n\nBasically to start keto all you have to do is limit your carbs to about 20g of net carbs (total carbs - fiber) a day. After that eat when you're hungry until you are full. If you don't feel hungry, don't eat. Don't worry about hitting your fat macros because that number is a limit, not a goal. Drink a lot of water and get enough salt, potassium, and magnesium or you are going to get muscle cramps. I drink Powerade Zero or broth to get my electrolytes.\n\n[This site from the Useful Links tab has a pretty good list of foods that you can have.](http://josepharcita.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/guide-to-ketosis.html#33MM) \n",

Then they had to step on it again to get me out.\n\nEven though I didn't get to do that there have been a few things that I have done that I would not have. Last Sunday I did the 25 mile Pittsburgh Pedal Crawl. Last month I went on my first vacation since my senior trip 10 years ago.

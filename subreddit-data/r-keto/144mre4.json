    "postText": "I suffer from hypoglycemia, but not the reactive one, but the one that lowers my blood sugar if I don't eat or if I play sports. \n\nBut with all the carbohydrates I eat to raise my blood sugar I can't go on a diet to lose weight. So I would like to try keto, I've heard it helps people with reactive hypoglycemia so I'm not sure if it also helps mine which is fasting hypoglycemia. \n\nI've heard that if you're on a no-carb diet but with more protein than you should be eating, your blood sugar spikes. So I could eat just protein without carbs, my blood sugar shouldn't go down. I don't know if I'm right to publish it in this section but all advice is welcome!",

I have nothing wrong with the exams, he advised me to try keto but not sure if it works as I don't have reactive hypoglycemia, I know there are people in this section with hypoglycemia so I wanted to ask if it worked for some, that's all.",

It\u2019s very hard to fast for extended periods of time or do any fasted cardio or even an intense yoga session will tank my blood sugar if my muscle glycogen is depleted/if it\u2019s been too long since my last meal. I don\u2019t understand really. I thought there were mechanisms in place to make sure that blood sugar didn\u2019t go too low. I don\u2019t have elevated insulin\u2026 I\u2019ve had it tested (and it was measured at like a value of \u201c2\u201d if that means anything to anyone here), so I\u2019m not insulin resistant in the traditional sense anyhow. Just still confused. These hypoglycemic spells haunt me and keep me stuck in unhealthy food patterns.",

            "comment": "Low blood sugars are only a problem if you are not fat adapted and therefore unable to use ketone bodies as a replacement fuel for glucose. My blood glucose levels have gone below 2 mmol/L while fasting for long periods without issue or I\u2019ll side effects.  2 mmol/L is about 36 in US units.  \n\nWith this in mind, yes going keto should help if you have a history of having negative effects from low blood sugars.  Eating high protein can create more available glucose, but the issue is not having glucose, it is using the alternative fuel source efficiently enough so that you do not require glucose as your only energy source.",

Why isn't your liver \"picking up the shortfall\" and producing glucose from tryglycerides?\n\nThe liver is what should be maintaining baseline glucose for anyone who is fasting. Interestingly, as much as everyone loves injectable insulin, it can cause hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis and death when you overdose - awful/scary to see but easily remedied with a glass of sugary drink. But really calls into question how benign it is.",

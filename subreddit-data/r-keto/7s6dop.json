Now that I'm doing it, it's completely surreal! I started Keto on 3/29/17 at 180 pounds (short girl here - 5'3\"). It was the heaviest I'd ever been. As of 1/15/18, I surpassed my 125 goal and hit 123.8! \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI am like most of you. I've spent the last 15 years + (my entire adult life!) trying to lose weight. I had tried every diet in the book from shakes, to juicing, to low calorie, to vegetarian bordering on vegan/raw. I tried spinning, running, weight lifting, HIIT, workout videos, everything! No matter what diet or exercise routine I tried, I just could not find anything that stuck. I was a major emotional eater, which led to binge eating. Food was pretty much my solution for everything. People would tell me that I just needed to eat in moderation and that if I deprived myself, I would never be able to sustain it. But I literally craved binging more than the actual foods I was eating, so I didn't know how to not binge and not feel deprived. On my last attempt at losing weight before Keto, I was in a weight loss competition at my gym. I counted calories and worked out like crazy, but it seemed like my body would just not lose weight. I finally started alternating between juice fasts and egg fasts in order to lose the weight and win the contest, but obviously that was not anything sustainable and I gained it all back (plus some) as soon as the contest was over. I felt completely hopeless and I thought that all of the years of dieting had finally screwed up my metabolism like everyone said it would, and now I would no longer be able to lose weight. On top of that, my mind was completely burned out on the constant dieting and I just had no willpower or determination left. I was to the point of pretty much just resigning to be overweight. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI don't know what made me start Keto on 3/29/17. It's the first time I ever just started a diet out of the blue. Normally I would have waited till Monday and binged on anything and everything the weekend before. 3/29 was a Wednesday and I had already eaten a high sugar breakfast that morning. It was completely out of character for me to start a diet in the middle of the day, but for some reason, I just decided to make a healthier choice and eat a salad rather than go get fast food for lunch like I normally would have. From there, I just made another healthy choice for dinner. Then the next day I started tracking in MFP and watching my calories and carbs. After that, I used the Keto Calculator to calculate my macros and I was all in. Keto has been life-changing for me. I still love food and I enjoy everything I eat on Keto, but I don't need it the way I used to. It doesn't run my life anymore. I am so proud to say that I have not binged once since I started! \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJust like everyone else, I had stalls, weeks where I didn't lose, weeks where I could tell my body was holding on to water, etc. While that can be tough, I just stayed consistent and kept going. I tracked everything religiously and didn't cheat (aside from a planned splurge on Christmas day - 9 months into my journey). I am definitely Keto for life! It makes me feel great and I still get to enjoy food without sacrificing how I look and feel. I am still debating whether I want to lower my goal weight a few more pounds, but I'm going to eat at maintenance for a bit and shift my focus to building muscle. I've been lifting since October, so I am going to continue that and see if toning my muscles will get me where I want to be. If not, I may go back to a deficit and lose a little more. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI wish I had tried Keto so much earlier. I wasted all of those years on bad diets that made me feel terrible. Almost as soon as I started Keto, it just felt like this is what I was supposed to be doing all along. If you're on the fence about starting, just do it!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n I'm happy to answer any questions!",

I have been failing on days I don't feel well emotionally and this post literally made me cry at work. I want to change even 1/2 as much as you did. I need to so I can feel better THEN look better without this fast food addiction lingering over me every. Single. Time. I feel like crap. \n\nCan you tell me if you did exercise with the diet change too? Immediately? After some weight loss? None at all? I'm 252lb and I have severe right hip issues that I was hoping I could get to 215ish before putting any impact exercise on the hip. Getting 40/50lb of body weight off the problem area alone will hopefully make me feel better immediately. \n\nThanks for your time. No rush on replying. And absolutely congratulations on your success - I sincerely hope you stay healthy and feel great forever! \n\nEdit: thank you to all of you that replied and are helping me. I work 11-12hr/day so I couldn't reply to every single comment below but I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. This is the most support I've ever received publicly for anything so its really helping overall with my decision to keep trucking. My goal is 3mo and if I can stick with it &amp; feel good, I'll stay. I definitely think sugar overall is a major issue with my weight and moods, so I'm hoping weaning off to see first might be a good starting strategy. Thank you, thank you, thank you!! \u2764\ufe0f",

I put my faith in the diet and used exercise for physical and mental health, so I started out just walking on the treadmill. Weight loss is mostly diet, so don't pressure yourself to work out if it's not possible right now. \n\nKeto regulating my hormones helped me control my urges to binge, but it does take mental strength, too. Keto made it easier for me, so now when I get that urge, I just tell myself that I'm not going to let these psychological/emotional cravings ruin my health and all the hard work I've put in! (Believe me, I know this is easier said than done.)\n\nWhile you're letting your body adapt to Keto, you might try telling yourself you can eat whenever you want, but it HAS to be Keto food.  Always keep your carbs in check, but for the first few weeks, don't worry too much about calories. Then hopefully the cravings and urges to binge will get better as your body becomes fat adapted and you can start decreasing calories. \n\nI know how hard it is. I have been there. It can feel overwhelming and hopeless, but you are in control. Just try to take it one choice at a time. &lt;3",

There *are* sugar-free candy options with low net carbs. When you really get a sweet-tooth craving, you can have one or two. It may sound backwards, but it can really help you wean yourself OFF of sweets, rather than going cold-turkey and then falling off the wagon again and again.\n\nRussell Stover has a huge [Sugar Free line](https://www.russellstover.com/sugar-free-collection#facet:&amp;productBeginIndex:0&amp;facetLimit:&amp;orderBy:&amp;pageView:grid&amp;minPrice:&amp;maxPrice:&amp;pageSize:&amp;) that Walmart and Target both carry. It's by far the best sugar-free chocolate I've tasted. Better than most chocolate-shop stuff TBH. Usually it's around 1g Net Carbs per 1-2 pieces. I don't comprehend how it tastes that good with that carbage, but it has yet to knock me out of ketosis and I've eaten 5-6 pieces in one day. My personal favorite is the Dark Pecan Delights. I also sometimes use the Solid Dark Chocolate to make hot chocolate. Dark chocolate will almost always be better carb-wise.\n\nHere's the thing. You don't want to rely on this stuff forever. Even though it's *technically* keto, it's still candy. It's not good for you. It's also still easy to over-snack on (doesn't last long at my house). Ultimately you should wean yourself off completely. But I know how hard it can be to start keto back up when you've been eating whatever you want, and sweets are one of the hardest to kick at the beginning. Moments of weakness come frequently in those early stages, so use these as a crutch or in case of emergencies. Remember, too, that the grocery store is where the bulk of the battle takes place. If you don't buy it, you can't eat it.",

My girlfriend is having similar issues where she goes to food to comfort her when anxious or depressed (even on keto). She's gonna be starting Wellbutrin though soon so hopefully, that will help.\n\nGood luck with the weight loss, I'm starting keto because I gained a crazy amount of weight on Celexa. Thankfully I switched to another one which has been weight neutral so far. The cravings on Celexa were insane, I imagine it's similar with your medications.\n\nSide note, I'm a big proponent of getting genetic testing to see what medications are best metabolized by your system. Not many people know about this option, so I always bring it up. If it's something you're interested in your psychiatrist should definitely know more about it.",

The weight control benefits have become secondary to the mental health benefits for me. \n\nI would recommend relaxing into it for the first month or so. Be gentle with yourself. Don't worry about exercise, allow yourself to eat whatever you want as long as you stay low-carb.... the exercise and portion control can come later after low-carb is well-established. My binge-eating issues have gradually gone away over the 3ish years I've been keto, with little to no effort on my part. It's been gradual though :) \n\nBest of luck! Happy to be of support as well. PM me any time! \n\nEdit: Also, if you're currently experiencing depression, have you looked into changing your medication? Maybe it's just not the right cocktail for you.",

They can trigger hunger that leads to binge eating. \n\nIf the latter then I would suggest looking for replacements for the excessive eating. Maybe you still eat, but make sure it has no carbs or high in fiber foods. So, you're still getting the act of eating, but fitting within your carb macro.\n\nAnother strategy is to add activities that take your mind off the emotional stresses. Maybe it's getting a massage, going for a walk, talking to a friend for support, doing something new, or even taking a nap. \n\nOne tip that helps me is drinking a glass of water and waiting 30 minutes. If I can convince myself to abide by that small measure I can still eat if I want after the 30 minutes. Most of the time I end up not eating. I use that a lot when I do water fasts.   \n\nI will say losing weight is mostly diet. You shouldn't need to exercise to lose weight. I lost 50 lbs in 2 months without exercise just by being strict with keto, and operating at a large deficit. That being said I've lost a lot less working out too, but body recomp is a thing. Somewhat it is competing goals.\n\nIf you have hip issues you may try swimming. Low impact, full body exercise, and low risk of injury. What I do is a HIIT session where I warm up for 10-15 minutes, and then do 4 x 25yd laps as hard as I can with 10 seconds rest in-between. After that I can stop if I need to or keep going. Most of the time I end up doing a mile, but I feel good as long as I got the HIIT in. If you don't have the endurance to do that then just do what you can until you do. If you swim most days then you should notice a difference. ",

I have stalls, my weight bounces, etc but I dont feel deprived, its easy to do w.o going overboard and obsessive with working out and counting calories. I hope I can be at my goal weight within a year too and it...it seems like I will. \n\nKeto has already changed my life and I seriously hope that I can get fit and be keto forever too :'D wish I found out about it sooner and this community too! \n\nCongratulations on your results and commitment, your body looks awesome!

I make Keto bagels (recipe [here]\n(https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/6rz0j8/fp_ketofriendly_sandwich_bunsrolls/)) that I often have for breakfast as well. I fast between 17 and 18 hours most days, so my \"breakfast\" is usually around 3pm and then I skip lunch. Dinners vary a lot, but basically meats, roasted vegetables, cauliflower mash, cauliflower rice, broccoli with pasta sauce and chicken, broccoli with loaded potato toppings (butter, sour cream, cheese, bacon bits), etc. I do still enjoy desserts, so I have something most nights. I'm a trained pastry chef, so I've made lots of Keto desserts because I enjoy baking. But I also have SF jello occasionally, a square of chocolate from Lily's or Choczero, or berries with whipped cream. \n\nI have a keto Instagram (@thisisketolife) where I post a lot of my meals if you want to check it out!\n",

IMO, it's absolutely, positively a requirement for people beginning any diet. You should be weighing all of your food and then tracking every single morsel. You bite it. You write it. (or log it). ",

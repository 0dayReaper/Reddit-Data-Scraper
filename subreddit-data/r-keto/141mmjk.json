    "postText": "I just have to say: I am as happy as a pig in sht right now. In fact it should be illegal to be this happy!\n\nAfter putting up with a vegan dr for several yrs who pushes Esselstyn/Forks Over Knives and was focusing solely on ways to make my bloodwork look like lowcarb/keto was bad, I did my research and found a great lowcarb dr near me!\n\nHe is really great, down to earth, and his family is from where I grew up!\n\nHe does low carb himself and tries natural remedies before going the drug route...something else I wanted in a dr.\n\nI am so glad you guys urged me to shop around for a new doctor!\ud83e\udd70\n\nI told him my story: 6 yrs ago was a 370 lb vegan dying of severe sleep apnea, CPAP changed my appetite away from ultra-processed foods/ sugars/other starches, lost 200 lbs,  that led me to Google what a diet like that would be called, and I found both paleo and keto which led me down other rabbit holes too since then, via health documentaries about seed oils, grassfed beef, regen farming, etc.\n\nHe said he agrees with me 100% on low carb etc.\n\nHe is also clever...I told him my blood pressure tends to be high when I see new drs bc of the whitecoat factor. He brushed it off and started asking where I grew up. Turns out we're both from the same neighborhood but different generations. The convo kept going, I felt very relaxed...he then took my BP and it was fine! Sneaky of him!\ud83d\ude01\n\nHe looked at my bloodwork reports from a couple months ago from the other dr.Said everything looks great, no more type 2 diabetes, no more fatty liver, everything is fine. He did say my total chol is a little over 200 but \"we'll just keep an eye on it\".\n\nHe's just a 10 min bus ride from my house too!",

I told him about keto, and he was really interested and kept asking questions.  \n\nIt means so much to have a great experience at the doctors office",

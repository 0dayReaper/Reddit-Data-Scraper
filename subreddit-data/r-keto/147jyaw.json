The machines seem to be stricken with let's say a degree of variability in their results.\n\nBreath meters seem to be worse offenders than blood I believe.\n\nI'll follow this with interest, I do still wonder if it's worth picking up a meter to satisfy my data driven approach to the diet.",

I've noticed a few people have told me on other posts that weren't approved that this kind of testing, or urine testing for that matter, are a waste of time and very inaccurate. But I also eat a lot of low carb alternatives like tortillas, sweets, breads, that I feel like are advertised as low carb but im suspecting some things are kicking me out of ketosis.",

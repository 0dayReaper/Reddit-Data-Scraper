So everytime I cut on calories like consuming very little a day, I get a weird sweaty-fruity like smell and it's so awful, I googled about it before and I got answers like it's the fat that is being burned (while it does smell like something is burning inside me lol) but I'm kinda worried because I also got results like it's a symptom of diabetes so I'm reeeally scared and I wanted to ask it's normal to get that weird body odor while on ketosis? Thanks for answers!",

Those unused ketones are excreted through urine and sweat and breath.  So you will likely notice a difference after adaptation.",

This is one of THE most common misconceptions that people have with Keto, mistaking Ketosis and Ketoacidosis.  But yes, if you're not T1, it is FAR more likely to just be being new to ketosis.",

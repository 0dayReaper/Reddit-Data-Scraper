    "postText": "(English is not my first language)\n\nSo I (28 f) started keto in January and lost 10 kg (from 92 to 82). I stopped around a month ago because of social events, wedding, etc. I ate whatever on weekends, but still continued eating healthy during working days and stayed active, so I just gained 500 grams. Now I am tired of carbs \ud83d\ude09 and want to restart keto to lose at least 12 kg more (I am tall so I think 70 kg is a good point). I feel enthusiastic but my only concern are summer fruits (watermelon, melon, etc.), ice creams and summer parties with alcohol (I think I will go for white wine and keto drinks, but I am always taking less care of what I eat when I drink). \nI will be writing around here my progress. Comments and tips are super welcome!!!",

However, frozen berries are essential as they make it an instant ice-cream. If you just want to make creamy one without berries, like vanilla, you would need to check how to make the mixture and then freeze it. I suspect any normal recipe would work, you just replace sugar with a sweetener of choice.",

It's been 2 months since that bad decision and I feel fat and bloated and have gained a chunk of weight back. The food I've been eating was convenient but definitely not worth this gross feeling.

I often eat 2 maybe 3 small meals a day.  the first one is all keto, 3 net carbs on like 500+ calories.   for dinner, I basically eat what I want.  But I don't want pizza or fries or any of that shit so it works for me.  The worst I do is using a bun on my double bacon cheeseburgers or a handful of potato chips at a friends bbq.  but other than that, its pretty simple to just eat the meat and cheese when you're at a party.  \n\nso i guess i never really restart keto.  i gave up measuring blood sugar a long time ago.  after so long you get a feel for things and just know what choices to make in your head.   \n\neat the watermelon.  eat the kiwis.  enjoy life.  but just be mindful of your goals.  watermelon wont kill you.  it wont make you gain 15 pounds. have a few pieces and move on.",

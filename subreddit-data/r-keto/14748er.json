They used to say that saccharin caused cancer. Come to find out, based on the amount they were giving mice causing cancer, a human would have to eat an 8x10 roomful of the stuff in order to replicate the effect. Most of these \"studies\" are done by competitors funding. No institute does studies independent of funding. Follow the money.",

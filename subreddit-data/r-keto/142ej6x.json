Then I ended up in the ICU and spent five days in the hospital (11-15th) and during that time I obviously wasn't on Keto. It's hard to be on Keto when the doctors insist on giving you an IV glucose drip!\n\nSince the day after I was discharged, I have been Keto with no cheat days whatsoever, and some pretty serious calorie deficits. This is now Day 21.",

            "comment": "I had the same 83 HbA1c last December. My blood sugar was 18,9. I wasn't even diagnosed as prediabetic before, I hopped straight into the deep end. I started keto on the same day of my diagnosis, and my blood sugar came down to the normal range in a few days. HbA1c was in the low 50's for me too in January, now it's dropped down to 32.\n\nMy first diabetes nurse was a disaster, said keto was dangerous and I should keep eating fruits, grains and veggies instead. This was the same nurse who told me diabetes was a chronic, progressive disease.\n\nIt's the disastrous advice you give people which makes it progressive, dear healthcare professionals. I've never heard anyone tell a lactose intolerant to drink a glass of milk every two hours six times a day. With the 50 gram a meal/six times a day meal plan they have for treating diabetes, no wonder the disease is progressive for most people.",

    "postText": "I have had weight troubles all my life.  Even when I was active I was overweight.  I'm 39, 6'3 and 420lbs currently and have been morbidly obese in the 400's for about a decade.  Food has always controlled my life as I think about it all the time.  I ate a highly processed fast food diet and was always hungry.  Its a small sample size but I've been doing keto for about two months and went from 470 to 420.  But weight aside, I feel better.  I have more energy, my body doesn't ache as much and best of all I don't get hungry all the time anymore.  Food isn't consuming my life anymore.  My highly processed diet was making me hungry because I wasn't feeding my body anything with nutritional value.  I feel satisfied sometimes with only one meal which is just so weird to me.  I actually have leftovers most of the time.  I've always been a clean your whole plate kind of guy.  I love to cook so the food plan is easy to keep up with and I'm saving money while eating higher quality food.  Any morbid obese/obese people out there that are hesitant and think they have no option and that the hunger is uncontrollable, try this.",

I'm not eating out of boredom or stress, or treating it like a hobby. I eat only when I need to, and lowest carbs possible. Keep up the great work!",

I started keto as a last ditch effort before weight loss surgery, and now I am down 50lbs in about 6 months! I sleep better, I have so much energy, and all my aches and pains are gone. I abandoned the plan for weight loss surgery and have been focusing on eating right and exercising. I have hormone issues so I don't lose as fast as I want but as long as that scale moves down I am content.",

I come from a big family plus I love to watch fat shows like 600 lb life and 1000 lb sisters and what not so it kind of normalized obesity for me.  I contemplated surgery as well because I could see myself heading to a severely unmanageable weight fast.  Keto is like the magic diet pill I've been looking for my whole life.  For the first time in my life I feel like food doesn't have a hold on me.",

More energy, better emotional state, and as you lose weight you start to feel physically better. I've also noticed I sleep much better, which has done wonders for both my mental and physical health. Congrats, and keep on going strong.",

I know correlation doesn\u2019t equal causation, but I\u2019ve had acne issues for years, and it just disappears almost completely after cutting out sugar and processed foods. When I saw a dermatologist as a kid, I remember him saying definitively that diet has absolutely nothing to do with skin issues. And even into my adult years, I was struck by how he said with such certainty that diet is unrelated. \n\nBut anyways! You\u2019re kicking ass \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc",

I see your weight loss has stalled from last month.\"\n\nUh oh!\n\n\"I think you might not be eating enough fat. Your carbs are good, as we can tell from your blood sugars, but I want you to increase your fat to protein ratio. Maybe some more bacon and cheese.\"\n\nDamn. That woman is awesome.",

The doc ranted and raved about my cholesterol and triglycerides getting out of whack and how bad it would be in the long term. Every time she saw me, she'd get into it again about how I would be damaging my body, no matter how much weight I'd lost.  I told her I'd stop what I was doing if my blood tests came back with negative results. I had the draw and went in for the doc to go over the results. The doc came in the room, sat down, shuffled some papers, and stared at me for a full 30 seconds. She then cleared her throat and said, \"alright, exactly what are you eating? My husband and I are going on this diet.\" My blood work was the best it had been in years, and my blood pressure  had improved. Now I get questions constantly about eating keto, and she shares recipes with my wife. I like it.",

Biggest difference I've had with limiting seizures and migraines is **sleep, ketosis, salt and intermittent fasting**. If you're not dreaming you're not getting good sleep. I found out I was a back sleeper many years too late and that has helped immensely. With migraines too, you've gotta make sure you're **getting enough salt** when going keto. I've got a jar of pinksalt at my desk and snack on it like candy to hold water and keep the migraines away. The day I discovered this was life-changing. I thought it was barometric pressure migraines and I was ready to move. Didn't need to when I get the appropriate amount of salt and water. Intermittent fasting will help keep your insulin levels more steady throughout the day. I eat one maybe two meals a day top, and symptoms have gone down substantially. Also you've gotta find out what triggers you. I found out that dairy (heavy whipping cream in coffee) was causing the daily migraine too. Some people like me are lactose intolerant from a cardiovascular level... It causes a constriction of blood vessels in the eyes and brain, (flashes and floaters) then later they expand and a migraine starts from the same place every time. This has lead to damage to my brain where they see it's bruised, like a boxer being hit in the same area over a lifetime. Bruising being a symptom of electron irritation and can lead to a seizure when enough are sending the same message. \n\nAfter curing the migraine once with a 10 day fast I decided to do an elimination fast:\n\nI did a carnivore diet (literally nothing but fatty steak and water). I ate the fattiest juiciest rib-eye steaks for 3+ weeks and within a couple days I'd had more relief than I've had in a long time. Then I slowly started re-adding ketogenic foods I'd been avoiding. Eventually discovering heavy whipping cream triggers me. Rib-eyes are ketogenic and can get you back on your feet. Don't wait years like I did. Take control of your life, find out your triggers for migraines and seizures and once you're regular you can dismiss that chapter of your life. ",

Small fish absorb a small amount of mercury from sea water and their foods, which is present due to both natural and artificial forces. The small fish only accumulate a small amount during their lifetime, but there is no mechanism for them to remove he mercury from their system.\n\nAs larger fish eat the small fish, going up the food chain, the accumulated mercury from all the smaller fish builds up in the large fish, again with no way to excrete it. This increases the mercury concentration exponentially at each level of the food chain. A 2000 lb tuna is pretty much at the very top, and as such has a comparably large mercury concentration.",

Couple slices of Wonder for a sandwich, no crust. I think not eating the crust was my way of telling myself that I was still in control of my life. \n\nIn college I started eating a lot more bread, and my options really opened up. Focaccia, pumpernickel, rye the cafeteria had all of them all the time. I don't even know when I started eating crust, and whenever I thought I might be out of control I told myself that it was just college. Everyone goes a little crazy in college, right? \n\nI dropped out my junior year, first I was spending all of my time in caf eating bread. When I ate through my food plan I started baking and selling my own stuff to buy more ingredients. I couldn't keep up with my school and maintain my baking schedule. \n\nAfter I dropped out my life spiraled down and I was eating bread just to cope with the things bread had taken from me. At my lowest point I would go through the couch cushions looking for crumbs, anything to take the edge off. ",

Additionally, keto is filled with low-glycemic foods that don't trigger an insulin response.  When you go back to eating carb-rich food, you don't get full, and so all that extra energy gets stored - exacerbated by the insulin response.  Basically, what this comes down to is that keto doesn't really change portion control habits - it simply has its own built-in portion control.  Therefore, the moment you return to your old diet, the old habits will come with it.  \n\nI suppose that you could do a carby maintenance diet, but I think, considering you probably have a habitual tendency to overeat carbs, it would be more of a mental battle to reduce your total food intake then to simply do keto as maintenance.\n\nAlso, not a stupid question.

Cardiovascular system is all well and good, and yes, sometime I will start exercising. Thank you for all your concern...I guess? \n\nEdit 2: My doctor was not wrong in what he said, he was definitely doing his job in telling me to exercise, I'm not upset with him at all, this wasn't meant to be a serious post and I certainly was not trashing doctors OR exercise. They're both important. I'm going to go try to run a 10k now. ",

Last weekend, I was feeling depressed and I wanted some comfort food, and I ate a Reese bar and a big bag of Spicy Nacho Doritos. Instead of kicking myself for falling off, I just got back on and resumed my normal diet. It will happen. You're human. Just do whatever you can not to make it a regular habit.",

My doctor had a huge issue with my diet, citing that I should be eating 200g carbs/day. She even set me up with a nutritionist to save me from my unhealthy/dangerous diet. I didn't take the advice and I dropped them, but one thing led to another and I've fallen out of keto. Working towards getting back.",

I know a lot more about the science than I can articulate here, but there is lots of good studies that talk about it. There is also a lot of almost religious like dogma around it, so be cautious. Yes, it can work if you do it and stick to it. Yes it can be healthy even for non-diabetics.",

But, I'm going to.. because I want to do a routine blood work check up now, and in a year and see how things progress haha.... I'm so happy to hear there are doctors out there who are responsive to this diet though &lt;3 ",

That seems pretty long term to me.",

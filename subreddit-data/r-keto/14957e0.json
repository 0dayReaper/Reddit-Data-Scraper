Trying to decide if it's worth it to keep going or if this diet just isn't right for me.\n\nAlso, how many mg of potassium and magnesium do we need to take? What forms of both?",

I've had insomnia for years but this has made it worse . Now its taking me longer to fall sleep some  nights and when I do , I  wake up several hours later. Before keto I would fall asleep and stay asleep until the next morning. So it's making me wake up much earlier basically. And harder to fall asleep.",

    "postText": "I read through the FAQ and unless I'm missing something I don't see  anything answering my question. I'm wondering if eating carbohydrates 1.5-2 hours before a workout is beneficial. around 20~ grams of carbs is what I'm considering as I did that before ketosis. The weights have been feeling heavier so I'm just wondering if that might be the problem, been in ketosis for about 2 weeks .",

Take it easy in the gym for awhile until you\u2019re fully adapted to keto, and make sure you are supplementing electrolytes per the amounts in the FAQ.\n\nYou may also find r/ketogains helpful too.",

I've tried some honey before going to the gym and don't really get much out of it. But fasted, I have tons of energy, and it's great having a big meal afterward.\n\nAlso, if you mean that you started the diet 2 weeks ago, you're still adapting and that's why you're not feeling 100%. You will once fat adapted.",

            "comment": "What kind of workout? Most workouts aren't that intense sorry. I feel it is just a way to justify eating carbs which you're craving... which is perfectly fine of course (it is your body), but you're not doing keto if you're having a carb meal before a workout. Now, for someone who does keto but before something like a half marathon or full marathon (which isn't an every week thing for the vast majority of people), sure, breaking keto for that specific event could be justified. They'll use all of those carbs and because they are fat adapted, they'll then tap into their fat stores too. All I'm saying is be honest with yourself. Keto might not be for you, perhaps what you're more after is a low carb, non-keto diet... again, perfectly fine, it is your body and you're the only one you have to justify your decisions to.",

            "comment": "No. It won't help if you are a ketoer. It may kick you out of ketosis for the day. Your body will have 5 grams stored for this already. You can have a slice of apple minutes before (1 or 2 grams of carbs), or coconut butter, etc. Body builders say you should try one slice of an apple *during* your weightlifting. But any more of that will just become fat/lipids (triglycerides) in less than 2 hours, I believe. Your body may use carbs if you are very intense; but it probably won't be 20g in an hour. \n\nRight now your body is adjusting to your level of working out. And you also want to figure out how much electrolytes to give yourself, given that you are very active. If you are already doing ketoade, then you may need only a pinch or more extra of sodium for each workout hour.",

I'd eat a banana before every workout, and get nauseous as a result.\n\nRemember, your body will eventually adapt to \"fat\" as it's main energy. Lift lighter weights until you can hit the same reps, and focus on full-body movements.  \nEx: pushups instead of dumbbell press.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Pushups use more muscles &amp; will ultimately help you lose weight faster.\n\n**Moral:** drink a strong pre-workout before the gym, and stay away from carbs. It happens to a lot of new keto dieters, until you realize you don't need carbs.\n\nDM me if you have questions.",

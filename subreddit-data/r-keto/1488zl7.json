Calculated without even adding the extra 200 calories yet, its 70 grams of protein and 40 grams of fat which is over my recommended suggested amount. \n\nSo yes there is food in my diet, and it's pretty healthy at that too. \n\nAlmost all of my vitamins are filled and the only thing I'm lacking are carbs, on purpose.\n\nNot everyone's body is the same. I'm not a 200 pound male with an active lifestyle. I'm a sedentary woman so please don't be rude about my eating choices. Thanks for the comment have a good day.",

That said, my macros are virtually the same as yours, so I totally get the small sedentary woman with a 1200-1300 limit.  It was simply an observation, and is possibly something to consider going forward if you determine that grazing on a bunch of small things isn't really working so well.",

I apologize for getting defensive I just have experience a lot of usually big men insult my food and calories and it bothers me a lot because I've put so much time into making sure I'm doing it right and not malnourising myself since I'm recovering from an ED. I'll give it a try but you may me right I can fill that 200 with some chicken! It's just really hard for me to eat the stereo typical yummy keto diet because the store is an hour away \ud83d\ude05 again if I came across as rude I apologize and I appreciate your help.

Yes, it's easy for big guys to talk about how they lose 4 pounds a week as if it's normal and everyone should be doing it, and totally demoralizing listening to people talk about their 2500 cal a day budgets.  Short, old, and still stuck at obese here, so I get it.",

What you\u2019re describing wouldn\u2019t fill me up.  \n\nMy day right now for comparison: 200g of egg whites, 28g of parmesan, 50g of spinach as an omelet with 150g of cucumbers on the side.  Heavy cream in my coffees up to 30 ml. For lunch, 220-240g of chicken breast in an unhinged enormous salad of romaine, avocado, cucumber, olive oil and vinegar.  Dinner is usually something like stir fried cabbage, celery, snow peas, etc. And like 250g of bison.   \n\nI\u2019ve already lost 70 lb and feel like I eat SO much food.",

I've lost 40 lbs so far and am only 5 away from my goal which is why I wanted to try keto so I can lose it from my stomach. \n\nI understand that to other people that it may not seem filling for them, but as a inactive woman it is for me. I'm already over my recommended protein and fat without even adding the extra 200-300 yet.\n\nSo thanks for the comment I'll look into it! but please keep in mind not everyone's body or lifestyle is the same. I have it all calculated to the very last macro on myfitnesspal and everything hits my requirements and is healthy for me and my lifestyle.",

I could easily cut down to 1200 and still make it feel like a massive amount of food.    \n\nI don\u2019t want you to feel defensive, more that I wanted to express you don\u2019t have to feel like you\u2019re \u201ceating keto recipes\u201d and that just plain old protein and veggies can get you really far!

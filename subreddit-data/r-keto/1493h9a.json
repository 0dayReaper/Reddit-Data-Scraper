    "postText": "I was in search for a better option than granulated Stevia, as the bitter after taste basically destroys the purpose of sugar for me personally. So after reading the forum here I decided to try Xylitol and bought a pack of Total Sweet, as I thought it was 0 carbs and 0 calories. I just received it and when reading the nutrients info, it actually has 100% carbs. So 4 gram of Xylitol has 4 gram of carbs. And it still has a massive amount of calories 240 cal per 100gr. So I feel a bit duped here (duped by my own lack of research).\n\nHowever, the information states that the carbs in Xylitol are Polyols. Which apparently don't count against your net carbs. Is that true?\n\n\"While Polyols are a carbohydrate, they are not a sugar. Generally, they are not absorbed by the body. When Polyols reach the small intestine, they are either not digested at all or partially digested \u2014 meaning if you are following a low carb or keto diet, you don't need to include them in your carb count.\"\n\nTLDR: Sugar versus Xylitol - what is the difference in carbs as they are both listed as 100% carbs?\n\nAny advice welcome.\n\nSo I am still looking for a 0 carb 0 calorie sugar without any weird or bitter after taste. Any suggestions?\n\nThanks",

            "comment": "This is correct. Polyols are \"sugars\" with an alcohol functional group. Some people do partially digest them, others don't. Because of this, polyols arent normally included in net carbs. You'd have to try it out for yourself and see how it affects you, but as another commenter said some people count them by half.",

    "postText": "I wanted to write something specifically to those of us who have 100, 200, or even 300 pounds to lose, from somebody who has been there. These are things I would like to have read 75 pounds ago when I started out at 415. If these offend anyone, my bad. Feel free to add your own two cents.\n\n1. **Everything you know about food is wrong.** I'm a reasonably intelligent, educated professional person, but I didn't know shit about food and nutrition. I thought I was eating \"healthy\" this whole time because I would get \"organic\" chips or I would eat sweet potato fries. Unfortunately, there are a lot of corporations out there that benefit from misinformation, and lots of food being touted as healthy that isn't. RESEARCH keto, HFLC, insulin, IF. YouTube, Keto subreddit, books... Google that shit, because most of what you know is wrong, or we wouldn't be this size. You're not stupid, you're mis-informed and you've been fed a lifetime of bullshit by a lot of bullshitters.\n\n2. **You're exhausted. Push past it.** Being super fat is exhausting. You have no energy. It hurts to put on shoes and go to the store, muchless walking around reading labels. START eating right and the energy will come. When I was 415 pounds, literally even walking *killed* my lower back. It was SO much easier to get starchy, carb-filled take-out with a pint of ice cream and check out after work. Because again, you're exhausted. Don't do that. Start eating right and the energy will come, and it will come faster than you expect it to. But seriously, just fucking start. Most people who have lost a shit-ton of weight wish they'd started earlier. The literal earliest point you can start is now. Don't wait for a health scare. Don't wait to get the energy. Don't wait until your first triple bypass to finally get the motivation. The motivation will come when you're eating HFLC and the scale is going down. That shit is super fucking motivating.\n\n3. **You will not notice body changes for a long fucking time.** I'm down 75 pounds, I still have a LONG way to go, and I'm BARELY noticing changes. All my clothes were stretchy (because I was a fucking 5x) so yes, my clothes are baggier than they were, but I'm still wearing my 415-pound clothing. Because it's all leggings and verrrryyy stretchy material. Learn to appreciate the non-\"noticeable\" NSVs, like \"my back hurts less\" or \"I can walk longer distances\". Don't get discouraged if nobody notices for a while because, and I hate to say this, skinnier people spend a lot of time trying to not comment on or notice fat peoples' weight. They may feel like they're offending you by pointing it out, or they genuinely can't/don't notice a difference.\n\nA skinny person can lose 30 pounds and it will be DRASTIC. If you're over 300 and you lose 30 pounds, you might not even be able to tell. Keep going. Keep fucking going. \n\n4. **The biggest battle you'll face is against hunger.** At my heaviest, I *lived* to eat. I'd eat everything I could, and I'd still always be hungry. Because of how our bodies store fat, I've heard it described something like this: \"Obese people are surrounded by layers of fat, but they're nutritionally starving inside.\" Really the *only* solution I've *ever* found is keto. Before I did keto 100% I would try and up my fat intake to stay full longer, but if you're eating extra fat and still eating a shit ton of carbs, that's not gonna work. Get rid of the fucking carbs (except for vegetables, veggies are dope).\n\n5. **Your friends will sabotage you.** Look, you're the fat friend. You're the friend your friends call when they want ice cream, pizza, cake, and they don't want to feel guilty about it because you're fatter than they are. It's shitty, but it's happened to me. Misery loves company, and the people around you will doubt/question/criticize or flat-out berate your lifestyle change. Find new friends or get real fucking good at setting good boundaries.\n\n6. **TRACK YOUR MACROS** When I wasn't tracking my macros, I was genuinely confused about how I was so heavy. It seemed to defy physics. I would eat fruits and vegetables, and it didn't *feel* like I should be as heavy as I was until I started tracking my macros. Fuck, I was eating a lot of food. Like, a lot. A pastry with coffee. Coffee with loads of sugar. Free food. Drive-ins. So, so many calories (thousands!!!) came from source I didn't even CONSIDER until I stopped eating shitty food. If you think you can eye-ball your keto journey and \"guess\" about keeping your carbs under 20 g, congrats, you're wrong. \n\nOne of the things I realized was that I was eating way way too much food to counter-balance the constant fatigue I felt, which actually turned out to be crazy blood sugar spikes from, ironically, all that food. It's such a vicious cycle.\n\n7. **Stop eating out** Just stop. Restaurants and fast food joints have zero stake in your health. In fact, they benefit greatly from your dependence on them and your repeat business. Cook your own food. It sucks, it's a learning curve, but you'll save all the money and you'll *actually* see results, instead of eating fast food \"low carb\" and still ingesting 3,000+ calories a day. Keto doesn't really work if you're still eating giant, giant meals that just happen to be the *right* food. Keto is great, but it's not going to replace actual physics. Trust me, I tried living on blocks of cheese every day at first. \n\n8. **Figure out what works for you, and fuck the rest.** My well-meaning friends are full of advice that seems good in theory, but absolutely doesn't work for me. I've gotten good at saying, \"thanks for the advice!\" and then just doing whatever the fuck I was already doing. My advice now comes from this subreddit, YouTube videos from doctors and nutrition experts, and science-based articles and books that genuinely know how the body works, NOT from my dear, sweet older co-worker who insists that fruit is the key to true weight loss. \n\nPlease feel free to add your own! I'm always looking for more advice from big people who've been there! KCKO!\n\nEDIT: OMG I walked away from my phone for a few hours and came back to so many awesome messages, comments, and gold bits! Thank you so much! You guys are so awesome. \n\nEDIT 2: Sorry forgot to add, feel free to message me for support! Also I just started an instagram to kinda journal my journey, add me at katelosesweight89!",

Because of how our bodies store fat, I've heard it described something like this: \"Obese people are surrounded by layers of fat, but they're nutritionally starving inside.\" \n\nIf you're obese, you're leptin resistant.\n\n*Leptin*, a hormone involved in the process of you feeling satiety, is secreted by your fat cells and increases as you put on additional fat.\n\nAs you continue to gain fat, leptin production increases and your receptors begin to down-regulate. As the fat continues to accumulate, you grow more and more resistant to leptin signalling, leading to a situation where you are producing massive amounts, but due to the down-regulation of your leptin receptors, you struggle to feel satiety and are effectively being told by your body that you need more food - which continues to drive the cycle.",

Our bodies are designed to prevent us from starving, so tell us we \"need\" a certain amount of calories to maintain our stores of fat because if we start using our fat stores we must be starving right? Cue the increased apitite.\n\nThe leptin resistant stuff actually makes more sense.\n\nBut one thing thin people don't have is starting strength. Us just getting up and going for a walk is the equivalent of a skinny person walking around carrying a bunch of weights. An unfit fatter person will be stronger than an unfit thinner person. So we only need to maintain that muscle and loose fat which is a diffetent process to losing fat and building muscle.",

(At least not from what I've read.)\n\nWithin a fairly normal weight range, leptin works as intended up to a point. You eat too much food, more fat stored, more leptin produced, receptors detect this and you feel generally less hungry, and then you lose weight because you eat less.\n\nIt's when you get really overweight such that it becomes a run-away train. Your body is pumping out so much leptin, but the hormone is blocked from reaching the appropriate receptors due so much triglycerides in your bloodstream. Also, there are other factors that block leptin as well when you're really overweight.\n\nSource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMdSHNnRbEs  (watch it at 2x -- it's kinda long, but worth watching...)",

Half the reason you feel fuller longer on keto is because your insulin is steadier and so leptin isn't blocked.

They need to be coated with fat and roasted or Pam seared until charred. Also the bigger sprouts are more bitter. I find the smallest ones I can and pan sear them with onion, garlic, bacon, and duck fat. ",

I used to be a vegetarian working in an organic grocery store. I met my husband working there. I ate everything \"right\" but... Well, you know.  My hubs is not keto and we argue about food/health sometimes but you can't win em all!\n\n&gt;3. **You will not notice body changes for a long fucking time.**\n\nI've heard of it being compared to unwrapping a roll of paper towel. At first, taking off even 5, 10 sheets is barely noticeable but once you get closer to the centre each sheet reminds you you're almost out of paper! \n",

So it's probably gonna take another 20 or 30 pounds before I, and others, see a real difference! Again, thank you so much for this! It was just what I needed!!",

I went through this for the first 4-5 months of losing (more than sixty pounds).\n\nI'm ultra-short (only five feet tall) but there *appeared* to be no visual difference when I dropped from 250 down to 190. People never commented or asked or said anything. _ had to hit a 65+ pound loss before anyone said anything. It sucked -- I felt like I was failing... but I was wrong! I was doing awesome, but every body is different. Plus, I wore the same clothing FOREVER -- and our new shapes are hidden under all that material baggage. \n\nAdditionally, I later found out that some people DID notice before ever mentioning, but they were afraid to say anything -- afraid they might hurt my feelings or say something upsetting. \n\nPeople ALWAYS notice before they're willing to  say anything.\n\nNow (at 80 pounds lost), I get comments all the time -- cheerful, encouraging comments. I haven't run into any negative comments. I feel lucky for that. ",

It hurts to see such smaller losses on ourselves. \n\n...But the comparison isn't fair and it isn't worth the heartache. Smaller people lose more slowly and generally need a bigger deficit. They also must monitor their intake much more closely. It's just life... and we're making the best of it, every day.\n\nWe're here for ya! Shorties in solidarity!!",

I've had a few notice but it's also people who know all about my new woe so sometimes I wonder if it's simply to encourage me which is totally fine! Today I put on a pair of jeans I haven't been able to wear in 5 years . Those bitches are a bit Snug and uncomfortable but you know I wore the hell out of them all day! I can't wait for someone who hasn't seen me in awhile to notice but I'm only down 33 so far. I know I'm babbling but one more point:\n\nWhen my sister lost 165 lbs from gastric bypass I was able to watch her change gradually. It didn't hit me how truly different she looked until I saw her before pictures. My mind was blown. When we see someone all the time we can't see the big changes since we're seeing the changes slowly. \n\nCongrats on your loss so far! We've got this and our life will change for the better. The best part is WE are doing it, not a surgeon. It's a lot to be proud of! ",

I get it, if someone compliments you, they are acknowledging that you were overweight previously and many people aren't comfortable with that unless they are a) very close to you, or b) accustomed to speaking their minds.  \n\nI suspect that even in your old clothes, people are noticing.

About once a week, a little cream with a splash of Torani syrup in it works just fine. I don't want anything else. It's crazy. My reactive hypoglycemia had me wanting to gulp down bags of sugar. Low carb seemed to reset that, even currently, when I'm off low carb because my potassium got low (I'm an unfortunate soul who requires MUCH more potassium than most people...why that is, I don't know, but I learned the hard way). I am eating and do want carbs, but there's no obsessive, mindless binging anymore. If I have an occasional binge (my cat died a couple months ago and I went to Jelly Doughnutville to mourn...paid for that shit, too, with a terrible hypoglycemic reaction...), it's a choice, not a compulsion.\n\nIt still amazes me.\n\n(Note: definitely NOT advocating sweets or saying everyone will have my experience!)",

If you eat in a healthy way, you'll be nourished and fed and your body won't need more, and won't ask for it. But, if you're like me, your problem isn't your body hungering for enough nourishment; it's your addictions demanding more sensory stimulus and the quick hit of sugar spikes. You're not going to get hungry for a kale salad; your body will want Doritos, Coca Cola, french fries, etc. *That* is the shit you'll find hard to push back on. Nobody's willpower cracks at 1AM so they can drive to an all-night grocery store to buy broccoli. \n\nThe battle is more easily won if you eat healthy, balanced meals with protein, fat, low carbs, lots of greens and fresh veg. When this happens, your body will get the nourishment it needs and will not ask for more. This means you'll be pushing back against cravings, addictions, and habits... but not basic hunger. Being sufficiently nourished not only means your body is not asking for more, but it also strengthens you to fight your cravings.\n\nGreat list, OP. Thanks for posting it. :)",

Most people who have lost a shit-ton of weight wish they'd started earlier. ... HFLC and the scale is going down. That shit is super fucking motivating.\n\nYes, absolutely.  I got the Lap-Band in 2008 and was encouraged to do low-carb (but not keto-intense).  At that time, at 444, I wasn't ready to give up carbs.  The lowest I got was about 361, gained it all back, PLUS went up to 526.  I kick myself every day for not having just went low carb back then and I wouldn't have had to do all this extra work.\n\n&gt; You will not notice body changes for a long fucking time. I'm down 75 pounds, I still have a LONG way to go, and I'm BARELY noticing changes. All my clothes were stretchy (because I was a fucking 5x) so yes, my clothes are baggier than they were, but I'm still wearing my 415-pound clothing. \n\nYep.  I have only really had to replace bras &amp; underwear so far.  The rest of my clothes still fit, though better now.\n\n&gt; The biggest battle you'll face is against hunger. At my heaviest, I lived to eat. I'd eat everything I could, and I'd still always be hungry.  \n\nI STILL struggle with hunger on keto but it's not as strong/painful now as it used to be.  But I can't give in because I still have to watch my calories.  I could easily eat a ton of food and keep my carbs in check, but calories get away from me FAST if I'm not careful.\n\n&gt; TRACK YOUR MACROS When I wasn't tracking my macros, I was genuinely confused about how I was so heavy. ... If you think you can eye-ball your keto journey and \"guess\" about keeping your carbs under 20 g, congrats, you're wrong.\n\nGetting my carbs under control was a lot easier for me after tracking for the first few months than CALORIES.  At my highest, my BMR was something like 3000 calories and I was like \"But there's no way I was eating that much, plus enough to GAIN more.\"  Oh yes I was.  It adds up so fast if you aren't careful, even now.\n\n&gt; Figure out what works for you, and fuck the rest. \n\nHonestly, I've had to apply this to advice I get from keto communities as well.  Reddit is very well moderated, but there is still a lot of conflicting advice.  So I do my own research if the advice doesn't sound right and follow what works for me.",

Slowly one by one, I had to start sacrificing my friends and social life to travel down the weight loss path and reach my original goal. It's one of the hardest things to do, because your friends are important to you. But, you have to remember you are important as well and sometimes sacrifices are necessary to be who you want to be and do what you want to do.\n\nSomething that recently happened to me was my now best friend approached me at the gym and helped me with my form for some excercises. I have been going to this for 2 years and not one person in that time has ever talked to me. Not a single one, all of a sudden he just walks up to me and basically says \"let me help you\" and so I did. It turns out he at the time was a HIIT trainer and also had lost weight. The choice I made to let him help me was one of the best choices made. If anyone at the gym comes up to you, talks to you, offers to help.. Please accept that offer. Those people are truly caring people, who do understand the stuggles that you are going through because they have been there and didn't let it go to their heads once they reached their goal weight. \n\nAgain, congratulations on your weight loss!",

This persons response was that it didn't matter...you would lose weight with dropping down to eating \"a couple double cheese burgers and a diet coke\"..... I just gave up.

It could be disheartening to me at times to see people posting 50, 75, 100+ lbs of loss in some seemingly tiny amount of time.  \n\nMeanwhile, the first 10 melted off, but each 5 after that was a *SUPER* hard fight every single month.\n\nSo for the \"skinnier\" people out there too, just like OP says\n\n&gt; Keep going.

After I lost my first 50 pounds I noticed I could start to move more and eased into spinning. Now that Im 100 down I can jog with 0 pain.\n\nLose the weight then add activity and check with your doctor if you have been sedentary for years and havnt been to them in a while. I have a heart rhythm disorder and it actually could have been dangerous for me to workout when I was so heavy and even now if I am not careful. You guys are all the best. Peace.",

But when I met my mother this weekend for a breakfast, she was totally stunned. \"Gosh, you lost so much fat off your face, how are you doing that?\"\nSo don't worry people - the scale does not lie, even if you can't see it, and new clothing sizes will soon be available for you.\n\nI also would like to add something that helped me much. I don't say \"I can't eat that.\" anymore, neither to myself nor to coworkes offering me food or birthday cake or whatever. I go on it like my vegan coworker. \"Thanks, I **don't**\" eat that.

When I used to eat carbs I could easily have 3,000 calories in a meal but now, eating more fat I just can't overeat. If anything, I need to track calories to consume more because I get so full so fast. I'm not sure if this happens with everyone, but I've read quite a few posts where people report this and it's a huge benefit. \n\nFor example, I have 3 strips of bacon and 3 eggs in the morning fried on the bacon grease. I added another egg and I couldn't finish. After that, I was full for about 5 to 6 hours. At my second meal I had to force myself to eat spinach, ground beef, cheese and sour cream.

Keto is awesome because you're not nearly as hungry.  The biggest obstacle depends on the person, but I'd say beware temptations.  Free food, sweets, snacks, or even the keto-friendly substitute for your favorite carby food.  Habit is another big one, as the habit to eat a certain quantity, frequency, or fullness is one you'll have to avoid.\n\n&gt; Your friends will sabotage you\n\nFriends, coworkers, even people very close to you.  \"Just one won't hurt!\"  November and December are hell.\n\n&gt; Stop eating out\n\nThis x100.  Posts about eating out on this subreddit always rub me the wrong way, because I'm all too aware that it's an impossible task to know what is in your food and how much.  I've gotten sick so many times because I've been served foods containing items I am allergic to, after explicitly asking if it has or is prepared with those ingredients.  Your servers don't know what's in food, and neither do you.",

            "comment": "While everything you said is true, the core part is still just how much you would eat.\n\n&gt;Fuck, I was eating a lot of food. Like, a lot. A pastry with coffee. Coffee with loads of sugar. Free food. Drive-ins. So, so many calories (thousands!!!) came from source I didn't even CONSIDER until I stopped eating shitty food.\n\nI have two meals a day, and i heavily consider each one of them. I consider each snack and each thing i pay for that i'll get to eat or ingest. If i eat two-three pastries that's already going to a 'meal' for me because it satiates hunger for the next 4-5 hours, but i know minus carbs i didn't really get shit from it aside from the tiny 50grams of whatever cheese or cream was inside. \n\nI would love to eat a 30cm sub in the morning, then drawn some great sugary drinks, before going in work getting some potatoes with a piece of greasy grilled pig and then an icecream for dessert and still have it be before 12AM. Then i'd eat some chineese takeout at lunch and get another dessert and wash it down with a cool coke. Ending the day it'd be neat to get a few slices of pizza and a few beers and maybe down a whole chocolate slab to end the day on a sweet note.\n\nBut i don't do that... i could, and i'd even like it, but jesus fuck all that food. I'm fucking sure i'm not consuming it for energy, let alone getting any real vitamins and shit out of it, so i just don't. Hell, i starve myself every once in a while just because i don't feel like eating then and there.\n\nMentality plays a huge role. I'm freaking out for getting 2-3 kg heavier on a double-digit weight scale and have already cut my weekly/biweekly 'indulgence' feasts. Thus for me food is just to keep me alive, or if i'm feeling like i'm peckish for something specific, i just account it in and know when i should be eating next, and what.\n\nI guess you would also confuse 'hungry' with 'tired', which for sure didn't help. I'm not sure you even felt hunger given the regular intake you were having.\n\nIn any case, good on you for getting your foot in the door and working to better yourself!",

            "comment": "this post is incredible. I'm not extremely overweight, but I think my advice applies to everyone, regardless of weight to lose: In addition to your excellent advice about \"just start now\"--in the beginning, the first week or two, if you find tracking calories and macros daunting, then don't. Just read up carefully on the keto diet, how it works, and review lists of keto foods. And eat from those. Nothing else is needed in the beginning, and for some people, this is all it takes. (Most people need to count or at least monitor calories at some point as they get closer to goal). I see so many posts on here and elsewhere about how people genuinely want to try keto but they are overwhelmed by macros and finding foods to fit their macros and calories goals and it deters them from even starting. If you are very overweight, just by eating keto foods and cutting out all soda, sugars, and carbs, you WILL lose weight in the first few weeks. I used to count calories, but I ate anything I wanted, so a lot of it was junk. In keto, I just wrote down what I ate for a few days, but I didn't look up the calories. After a week, I found that even on my most \"indulgent\" days, I was still eating at or below my prior calorie limit without even trying, because it's hard to overeat broccoli and steak, even if the steak is amazingly delicious, but it is not hard at all to overeat hundreds of calories in carbs, like rice or pasta. I think one day I went over my prior calorie limit by like 100 or something, even though I felt like I was eating all the time and after the first thee or four days, I never felt hungry.\n\nTLDR: Don't let calories and macros intimidate you or deter you from starting. Just start and once you're in keto with your appetite controlled and mind cleared, you can plan the rest of it. ",

The more fat and protein you eat, the more full you will feel on average. Best not to stress about calorie counts in the beginning.",

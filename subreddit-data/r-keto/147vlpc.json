And I meal-prep my lunches on sunday; I shred up two rotisserie chickens from the market and divvy them up into my little lunch trays to be had with a side of avocado. Dinner is usually just a whey protein shake to which I always add a tbsp of psylium husk powder (this helps make sure I'm satiated as a single scoop of whey powder in water might not cut it). I'm certain that eating the same thing all the time ain't for everyone, but it's been working for me for the last several years.",

I won't pretend to know how to read or interpret any results myself, but the feedback from my doctor is that everything looks great and has raised zero concerns. \n\nI do take some supplements to plug up any possible holes in the boat though. I usually take a basic multivitamin, vitamin D, a fish oil softgel and I throw a scoop of \"super greens\" into my whey shake. BTW, I used the app/site CRONOMETER to put my plan together, which helps me gauge which nutrients I need adjust. I know a lot of people prefer MyFitnessPal, but Cronometer just clicked better with me.",

I also have ground beef weekly, and Stryve biltong as a snack for some added pure protein. \n\nIt took me a little while to get into the groove with meeting my protein goal, but I\u2019m on it now.",

Start including things like cottage cheese and labneh to break up the protein sources. Icelandic Skyr is like 19g of protein per serving and is frigging delicious.\n\nLearn how to make cauliflower fried rice, it is super easy and a great way to sneak in protein and eggs into an Asian style dish. Frozen low carb stir fries from the supermarket are another great way to incorporate protein into a quick dish. Chicken cordon bleu is super easy to make. I crust mine with pork rind breading and between the chicken, ham, and swiss you are getting a lot of protein in a small delicious package. \n\nYoutube has great videos on fried keto foods with protein powder/pork rind breading that is phenomenal for fried chicken cutlets and pork cutlets. There is a channel called Indigo Nilli that makes all kinds of bread for sandwiches and pizza with egg white protein powder that looks great, easy to make and doesn't have junk fillers or stabilizers. I'm actually making her pizza crust tonight so I'm really excited about it, My cauliflower pizza crust experiments suck big time.",

I know meat is generally more expensive in Europe than US  Most sausages are a good choice, except types that add bread crumbs.  In the US, Hillshire Farms is a common sausage brand, but it adds sugar.  If you can eat dairy, cheese is a good protein source.  Hard, aged cheeses are low in carbs.  Soft, fresh cheeses can be higher, so read the labels.  Canned fish such as tuna, sardines, herring can be a moderate priced option.  Tofu, unsweetened soy milk, or other soy products.\n3. You may not need 100 grams of protein per day.  It depends on your height and weight,  so use a keto macro calculator like the one in the FAQs.  Most people on this group suggest higher protein.  In contrast, there are several keto/low carb doctors who advise eating much less protein, especially diabetics since protein raises insulin.  (Stephen Phinney, Eric Westman, Jason Fung, Annette Bosworth, Peter Attia.)\n4. Weigh and measure what you eat and enter into a meal tracker so you can see what your actual macros are and not just guess.  This is a lot of trouble, but after a couple weeks you will have learned a lot about what foods and meals work for you.  After that you may not need to continue.",

They usually have decent marbling since the chuck eye is the end of the rib eye cut, but in my opinion is better cuz it's like $3-$4 less per pound and if I eat one of these for breakfast, 6-8oz of meat is a perfect way to wake up. Plus I drizzle on some of the oil/ghee I use to cook it in for a bit of extra fat. Since I can't afford to do this every day, I usually do it on Mon-Wed-Fri for breakfast, with eggs &amp; bacon/sausage the rest of the week.",

            "comment": "Op, im currently doing high protien adequatw fat keto. My fat limit is 67 g and my protuen goal is 148g. \n\nThat meant i stick with mostly lean protien. Meat, fish, shellfish, chicken, turkey, etc ate great , but delendibg on the cut can have a lot of fat, or in the case of organ meats have pretty big amount of carbs believe it or not. \n\nSo, here are some tips. As other saud, prioritize protien. \n\nMy breakfast today was 5 oz baked bonekess skin on turkey breast with a dairy bowl. The dairy bowl had skyr, bulgarian yogurt made with whole milk, frozen blueberris, walnuts, one scoop gold stadard choc protuen piwder, one scoop garden of life vanilla protien powder. I threw in a bit of cinnimon for glucose control. No coffe or caffinated tea but one coke zero since i woke up late and was a bit groggy. \n\nSupper, i did pre cooked seasoned shredded chocken i hot with in stire coupon. I heated up in micriwave. I got 2 zero net carb tortillas, i got sime skry in place of sour cream and some colby monrrey blend i grated myself, sweet mini peppers, and onion. I had more filling than woukd fit in the tortillas so did 2 tacos and a bowm of extra filkin seperate . I cooked the veg in a skillet with a bit if water to lightly soften. That was my total foid intake.\n\nOp, u mix and match to get ur macros in. If u need less fat do skyr or yogurt and protuen powders for ur protuen. Buikd ur carns and fat aroubd that. \n\nMy breakfast had most of my cals and carbs as well as highet protien. Supper had lower cals, and carbs but had higher fat. \n\nBtw, supper i used home made skyr i made with whole milk (furst batch) and breakfast had part of a singke serve of store bought skyr that i used some of as starter cukture for my own. The bulgarian yogurt was stire bought because ive tecentky had some issues with it fermenting right and what i didnt need for starter cultire i simply eat as is. \n\nAnd op, yes i do make a lot myself. And no, i dont buy a lot if keto products. But i like having them sometimes if its not eildky expensive like ketk sandwich breaf in my area tends to be. Tge occadional keto tirtilla or keto hot dog bun wont kill me and im working on finding a recipe to maje my iwn that im crazy for so i can nix those too. \n\nBaby steps on that though. And yes, i do use frozen or canned foods sometimes. I almost never buy heat and eat anymore. The shredded chocken was a rare find with 2 g carbs so worth it esoecially with the in stire coupon reducing the cost .",

                            "comment": "No prob. Im guessing ur new to keto and havung probs figuribg out how to balance things to get proper nutrition and not be hungry. \n\nUrs is not the first post ive come across where the op was asking hoe to get more fat or protien in. \n\nI originally started off with more of the high fat adequate prituen keto and did that all of last year. But, by december i was aroubd the last 50ish poubds to lose for healrhy wright and my progress slowed so i switxhed gears to higher protuen adequate fat. \n\nSo habing done both formats, ive gotten pretty good at finding tge best and most buget freindly ways to get proper nutrition in with either firmat.\n\nWith me being 5'2, i dont need a lot of cals so when i switched to high protien i had to nix fatty protien unless its a small amount mixdx with lean because fat is far more calorically dense and i dont need the extra cals because of my smaller size and body type. \n\nThere are those who do high protirn who dont have to limit or nix fatty protien because of havung a bigger build than me. They need the higher cal intake, i simoly dont.\n\nThat dlesnt mean i nixed red meay though because i not only like red meat, but have had issues with anemis so its kinda a must along with organ meats for my diet and health. Esoecially when im on my petiod since i always bleed and cramp heavy. Heavy period bleeding witj history of anemia caused by nutrient mal absorbtuon, yeah im not nixing red or organ meats ever. Just uding them as needed or sticking with leaner cuts like sirloin and chuck. And no i dont buy the ground versiin because piund for pound it costs 3 times ad much as a steak or roast of the same cut. Id rather buy tge less expensive ootion of the steak or roast. \n\nTgat way i can cook a big slab of meat for multiple meals but keep tge cist down. \n\nAnd yeah, i dont mind givibg tips and tricks to balamce things. I have hoshimotos and possible ibs. I dont tolerate some veg at all. I have reactive hypoglycemia which causes glucose spijes and drops which can get nasty. Its why i do the higher carb limit actually because the standard 2pg carb limit caused multiple er trips from severe glucose drops when i tried. Tge flucose drops triggered migrains thay caused severe pain and lasted 12-72 hours . The pain caused nausea so bad i coukdnt hold diwn water, and going to the bathroom wpukd cause motion sickness often bad enough id vomit. Simply put, standard 20g net carb limit is unsafe for my body and its needs. Being tepeatedly sent to the er and put on iv pain meds, iv fluids, and iv anti nausea meds isnt healthy or productive. \n\nBut, its part of my trial amd error of figuring out my own needs and adapting aroubd them. \n\nAs a newbie, u will stumble amd fall figuring crap out. Dont feel like u failed or screwed up. Its a kearning curve and practice makes perfect.\n\nU have to crawl before u walk, and walk before u run. U have to practice and train in running before u slrint or do a marathin or 5 k run. Keto works on the dame princilple especially with newbies like urself. \n\nAnd i dont mind helping when able",

Sometimes, I double up scoops, like Chocolate and PB, with 8oz unsweetened almond milk and that's an excellent meal right there. \n\nProtein Sparing Modified Fasts Bread by Maria Emmerich (you can look it up, it's easy to find and quite popular). This bread is made out of egg whites or egg white powder (depending the recipe and your preference). \n\nProtein Sparing Noodles/Crepes/Wraps. These are made with egg white and 1 egg, cooked like crepes, where you can either use as crepes, wraps, or roll and cut to make noodles.\n\nBeef Biltong, Meat Sticks....Carnivore Crisps...all great protein sources too.\n\nOr, if you have a big appetite like me, eating 6-8oz or more of lean protein. I can easily eat a 12oz steak too. But I understand, it's not for everyone. \n\nAnother person said to prioritize your protein in your meals. I couldn't agree more. It could be that you're taking in too much fat? Either way, a nice steak is pretty balanced. If it's too lean of cut, or some other lean protein, fry an egg on the side or bacon. \n\nThe Protein Sparing Modified Fast breads and noodles really help if I don't have a lot of meat available. I'll make a burrito or sandwich.\n\nThe Equip Prime Protein is also very helpful for me. Especially if I'm too busy to fix myself a whole meal. \n\nI hope this helps. I often exceed my protein goals because of these things! And my fat is typically between 50g-80g, unless I am protein sparing, where it is then 20g-30g (that's only a few days a week maximum).",

It's really hard to be truly protein deficient with access to Western food. With 40g per day you should be fine. 20g per day is probably just fine in your situation too for months and months. You can do fine with zero for weeks. It seriously should be almost impossible for you to develop a real protein deficiency with access to Western foods if you don't have severe dietary restrictions. It is almost unheard of. People living in senior communities are the only Western citizens who have a significant percentage (10-20% in some studies) eating below recommended levels of protein, as animal protein is disproportionately inexpensive in western countries, but they aren't suffering from clinical protein deficiency, just less daily intake than recommended.\n\nBut you have many options. This is probably easiest to solve with snacking. You could take low carb nuts and cheese with you to work. You could suffer through protein powder. Eat jerky or slim Jims or pepperoni or summer sausage. Black soybeans are delicious. Many many options. But don't worry that you aren't getting enough protein to remain healthy, even if it might possibly be optimal to eat more. If you live in a western country, without major dietary restrictions, and your diet isn't just bag salads and dressing, you are fine.\n\nHope the wall of text was helpful or at least reassuring.",

Hot sauce works wonders, makes you feel like you're not just eating a slab of meat (and most hot sauce has vinegar, which naturally fights inflammation). When I am genuinely hungry, I will not turn my nose up at the above meats. If you're hitting your fat goal, but not your protein, then you need to switch out some of the fatty meat in your diet for leaner meat. Ideally, you don't want too much omega-6 fat, and fatty pork and chicken are high in omega-6 (due to the corn and soy diets they are fed). You could also do skinless chicken thighs or ground meat (chicken/turkey/pork/beef/lamb/bison). Beef liver is high in protein and low in fat too, and is extremely nutrient dense.\n\nThe reason you don't want too much omega-6 fat is the way corn and soy makes pigs and chickens fat, it too makes humans fat (humans are monogastric, just like pigs and chickens). Because our stomachs aren't designed to properly digest omega-6 fat, it accumulates in our fat cells and causes inflammation. Our ancestors survived on a diet that was close to 1:1 omega-6 to omega-3 fats; conventional pork bacon is close to 20:1 omega-6 to omega-3 fats. If that's not enough for you, I have some anecdotal evidence too. A few years ago, I worked in a supermarket at the meat department. Sometimes, people would take pre-packaged chicken breast and ask us to cut it up for them. Sometimes they would bring conventional, sometimes organic. You could clearly see that the conventional chicken breasts were 2-3 times the size of the organic (inflammation).",

But his employer forced him into certain paths of treatment. He told me, I'm a T2 diabetic. I'm supposed to be on metformin, lisinopril, a statin and do a low-fat diet. If I don't adhere to that, then he's supposed to fire me as a patient.\n\nHe did things to \"get around the system\" for a lot of his patients. And he ended up getting fired for it. I tracked him down and we had a long conversation. I was his patient since the 1990s and he told me we were friends. He told me his biggest regret was selling his practice and becoming an employee of a larger health company. That severely limited his treatment options.",

Total\nCholesterol was only in the low-mid 200s when he was put on the statin. Total and LDL went up when he had been on keto a few months but \u2018cheated\u2019 periodically, but his HDL went up and his triglycerides were in normal range!

Perhaps, your husband could get a second opinion from a specialist / cardiologist. They can do a Calcium scan (CAC) to see if he really has a heart risk. It would be a well spent $100, even if he gets it done without a referral from his doctor. That could maybe convince him to get off the statins. A stent would be used if there's a current artery problem. It takes years to develop heart disease. So if he doesn't have a problem now, he has time before he needs medication to prevent heart problems. I think a cardiologist could give a definite diagnosis, the gp is just guessing right now.\n\nAs far as the junk foods... maybe making him full with fiber can help. Half a teaspoon of psyllium husk in the breakfast is flavorless and might make him too full for the morning donuts. A few homemade cheesy flax crackers with the lunch would add fiber too. Or maybe you guys could come to an agreement to only have junk foods between noon and 4pm? Then the next 20 hours of his day could be super low carb, high fiber. This would be a very very slow way to lower the blood sugar. But he would not have to do the keto carb withdrawal this way with each cheat.",

If you've never eaten low-carb/high-fat before, don't go from a standard diet to full-blown keto in a single day. That's a recipe for digestive troubles haha. \n\nOver the course of a week or two, increase your fat/protein while decreasing your carbs. \n\nDo you normally have pastry/bread or cereal for breakfast? Maybe have meat/eggs one day instead. And then eat as you normally would for the rest of the day.\n\nAfter a couple of days doing that, start thinking about lunch. Do you usually have a sandwich or something? Try substituting for a salad with a fatty dressing (vinaigrette or something creamy. we americans love a good [ranch dressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch_dressing) haha) \n\nAnd then after a couple days of substituting your breakfast and lunch, think about your dinner. You get the idea. Just try to ease into it and you shouldn't have any big problems",

After 2 weeks I was walking with a cane, and my knee pain was so bad I couldn't go up a flight of stairs without extreme discomfort.\n\nMy doctor marked me as allergic to statins and we moved on. Fast forward to 2020. New doctor. Asks me what symptoms I experienced with statins that made me think I was allergic to them.\n\nI told him about my problems and he told me that I NEED a statin, and that he wants to cycle me through a bunch of different statins till he finds one I can tolerate. And if he doesn't find, then he'll prescribe more medicine to help with the statin side effects. I told him no. I wasn't doing statins ever again.\n\nOne problem doctors face now is if they don't prescribe a statin, sometimes their malpractice insurance won't pay out if someone sues them. On the Low Carb MDs podcast, they talk about doctors needing to defend their medical licenses for recommending keto to patients.\n\nI can't imagine being a doctor now. So few doctors now own their own practices. Almost all of them work for some health conglomerate now that dictates the standard of care.",

When my results came back - flagged for high cholestrerol - she said \"we are supposed to have a talk about statins, etc however, your results are perfectly healthy for keto and I will send you out for a CAS next year\". \n\nThen I had to change providers. My new GP is fiercely for the standard food pyramid so I did not bother telling her I am keto for 6 years now.  She called me a few weeks ago to talk to me about going on statins and so I asked if she could set me up for a scan first.  She had no idea what it was - but to her credit she is looking into it.  \n\nMy poor sister saw my results a few years ago and jumped into keto. Went to her doctor at the 3 month mark and has been on statins ever since and is convinced I am killing myself.  Recently, I asked her if she remembered how great she felt at the 2 month mark on keto and she admitted it was awesome. \"Imagine feeling like that all the time, even as you get older!\".

            "comment": "My doctor is young and awesome, too. She\u2019s maybe not listening to podcasts, but she has watched me lose 105 lbs and seen my blood work improve from type 2 to pre. My keto is more low carb and I use exogenous ketones sometimes so I can have a few berries now n then. It\u2019s a totally sustainable lifestyle especially compared to the calorie counting and fierce exercise I did to lose 100 lbs before which quickly unraveled. My doctor is willing to learn from me and allow me to make my own decisions. She\u2019s priceless.",

            "comment": "I can\u2019t confirm this from my own knowledge but have read a lot on Reddit that it\u2019s better to see a dietician than a nutritionist, because there are more stringent qualifications required to be a dietician whereas anyone can technically call themselves a nutritionist. I\u2019d also imagine it\u2019s like doctors where some are more keto savvy than others.",

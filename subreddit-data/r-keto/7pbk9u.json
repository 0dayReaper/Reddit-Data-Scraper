    "postText": "Update is finally here!!\n\n[PICS](https://imgur.com/a/HuxSR)\n\nJourney has been 4.5 years with the almighty keto. \nI lost 130lbs and recently had tummy tuck surgery to remove excess skin from my abdomen. This is my update. \nHere is link to original post [fuck Friday this can\u2019t wait](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7g4he9/fuck_friday_this_cant_wait_today_is_the_day/?st=JC8BEF5E&amp;sh=94a5e6ec) \n\nI have recovered with flying colors. \nGoing for my 6 week final post op appt tomorrow. Feels great!!\nI am so happy with my results!! My surgeon did an exceptional job. \nWith keto, I finally gained control of my life and lost 130lbs. I\u2019m so happy to be finally reaping the full benefits of my hard work and dedication. \nMany details a lot of people never even think about: For the very first time in my life I have a waist and hips!!! Also, I now have a lap. My twin niece&amp;nephew were able to climb into my lap comfortably together on Christmas. I don\u2019t have to worry about my stomach making weird skin slapping noises when I move or exercise. No more wearing deodorant under my belly.  \nWarning!!! NSFW details: When reaching between my legs you feel fun bits instead of just belly. And...I feel cute in panties! A seemingly small detail of femininity I was never privy to which is really a huge challenge (now addition) to self-confidence. \n\nA literal and metaphorical weight was lifted off me. I feel like I have a second chance at being the healthy and happy person I\u2019ve always wanted to be. \n\nSurgery details: My surgeon removed 10lbs of excess skin from abdomen. He did not need to tighten my abdominal muscles. And he did not do any liposuction. Both were \u201cpossibly needed\u201d pre-surgery but deemed unnecessary once in. It was a 2 hour outpatient procedure.  I had 2 drains afterwards. One removed after 6 days, the other removed after 20 days. I had a novocaine pump in me for the first week.  \n\nFor those curious about the recovery:\nI went to hell and came back. The pain was surprising honestly. I was under the impression I would feel most pain around the incisions. Boy was I wrong. Incisions are numb. Even still, lots of numbness along there as my nerves are reattaching themselves. The pain was the shocking feeling of tendons and fascia stretching, tugging, and pulling across my abdomen. After the initial surgery drugs wore off, I couldn\u2019t stand up straight for almost 2 weeks. It was hell. At the time I said to everyone I wouldn\u2019t recommend this surgery to anyone who does not need it drastically. It\u2019s very painful and debilitating. You will not be able to work for at least 2 weeks. And after that it will be challenging and often painful for 2 more weeks or more. And that\u2019s coming from a healthy 27 year old who healed fast. \nOn the other side of recovery, im ECSTATIC with my results. My surgeon did an exceptional job!!!  \n",

By far the worst pain I\u2019ve ever experienced.  Still so glad I did it.  I\u2019ve even lost 20 more pounds since then.  I\u2019d assumed I couldn\u2019t lose any more.   \n\nPeople can be judgmental about plastic surgery, but it\u2019s so much more than cosmetic.  My skin hurt all the time.  Life is just so much better now.  ",

Then the staff there told me some info as well, like my doc does almost as many tummies as breasts. Which is atypical in plastics world as breast surgeries tend to dominate. So my dr has TONS of experience with tummies. ",

Brain is foggy, the drugs can only do so much, and when you take them you get confused/emotional, and when you go off them you get a different emotional overwhelm.\n\nI have 0 regrets and love the way my own surgery has settled.

June is when everyone wants time off for vaca. So December it was! \nI got down to 160lbs before surgery. \nAnd honestly, I don\u2019t really want to lose much more. My other skin areas will only get softer and saggier. Like my thighs and arms and back. These areas only became a noticeable problem in the last 20 lbs or so. ",

I've got awful arm flaps and they make me feel just as bad about my arms as before I started losing weight.\n\nThank you for posting! I am very very close to reaching 100lbs lost and have been trying to figure out if I want surgery. If you feel like answering yet another question: What does maintenance eating look like for you?",

Maybe more in your case. \nTips: support system is key. Pain is by far the worst when moving.  And You have extremely limited movement for quite a while as well. \nMake everyone else bring you water (and drink tons of it!!!), and food. Get some baby wipes to stay clean while you are not able to shower regularly. You will not be sleeping laying down flat for a while. Have LOTS of pillows handy to prop where needed. I slept with pillow underneath my knees for weeks. Find Netflix shows to binge. \nAsk friends and family to stagger their visits. If anything like me, you\u2019ll be going nuts sitting still for so long. My friends kept me entertained and looking forward to something every day. \nBe sure to have some loose comfy pants to lounge in. I switched to tighter comfy leggings pretty quick because I I wanted to look down and see that flat stomach. You may want to go buy a pair of smaller sweatpants to lounge in. I really loved getting to put on smaller clothes like immediately. \nGood luck with your surgery!! \n\n\nPs: make sure your pain pills and water are in arms reach for the instant you wake up!!! You\u2019ll probs need them to kick in before you can even go to the bathroom. ",

Good lord just think how much worse it would have been if they actually had to mess with abdominal muscles.  Yikes!\n\nAnyways... supercongratsgreatjob!  I didn't have as much weight to drop, but for me, one of the small things I noticed was being able to wear cute pajamas and feel comfortable in them at the same time.  Before, it was always pajama pants and oversized tshirts... which are still comfy, but never cute.  I say this because I noticed you got some of those Lisa Frank pajamas... which are awesome!  I also love the outfits in the last two pictures.  It looks to me like you're having fun discovering/rediscovering your own sense of style in your new size, I hope that's true!  ",

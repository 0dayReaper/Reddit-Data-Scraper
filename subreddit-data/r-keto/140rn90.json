    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI\u2019m transitioning back to keto. I took a short break, but I know I feel better when I\u2019m on a keto diet. The problem is that I have extreme sugar cravings. I workout 6 or 7 days every week: cardio almost every day, and lifting almost every day. I burn about 500 calories every day, and my calories for the day is about 2000 (before subtracting any calories that are burned). I am focusing on having more water, electrolytes, green tea, and Apple Cider Vinegar.\n\nWhat other suggestions do you have?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Most ppl fail, so good for you that you're doing something you don't want to do (to improve yourself).\n\n**The sugar cravings will pass, but a few questions/suggestions:**\n\na) are you eating anything with sugar in it? Like a candybar or \"sugar\" in your coffee?\n\nb) I personally found Quest Bars (birthday cake &amp; cookies &amp; cream), and good fat bars (Suzie's or Love Good Fats) taste \"sweet\" but aren't actually made with sugar. I got used to eating one quest bar per night for 'dessert\" and a peanut butter food fats bar for my snack everyday (tastes like Reece's peanut butter).\n\nc) Most \"keto\" snack bars are designed to taste like chocolate or sweet stuff - you can trick your body into that. It's more of a mental game of \"this is my dessert\". That's how I got used to eating a Quest Bar every night for \"dessert\".\n\nI lost 70 pounds on keto. DM me if you have more questions.\n\nGood luck and keep up the good work!",

It really took a long time of trial and error. So far I\u2019ve been completely off sugar for over a month with the exception of one mixed drink at dinner a few nights ago. \n\nWhat really helped ultimately was to kick processed foods for good.

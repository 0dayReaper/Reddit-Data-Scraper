    "postText": "And for people who like to jump right to the images:\n\n[Before and After](https://imgur.com/gallery/rRrp44P)\n\nI started keto in May of 2019. I was over 400 pounds at the time. I had a hard time doing a lot of very basic things. I got out of breath easily, and I was too big to fit in booths, standard chairs, and closed MRI machines. I became prediabetic and had alarmingly high blood pressure. I was afraid that I wasn't going to live long enough to see my four-year-old twins grow up. I felt hopeless and sank into a deep depression.\n\nAfter some therapy to deal with the depression issues, I decided that I wanted to improve my life, and that meant getting my weight under control. I lurked here for a month or so, reading and re-reading the FAQ, researching keto, and getting inspired by all of the success stories here. So as I hit my first major milestone, I wanted to share my story with you as thanks.\n\nMy blood sugar, A1C, and blood pressure are now all back within normal ranges. I look better and feel healthier than I have in years. I can play outside with my kids! I still have a ways to go for my goal weight, but life is already so much better than I ever imagined it could be again.\n\nIf you're thinking of giving keto a try, go for it. Your health is worth fighting for. And for everyone in the middle of their journeys, keep strong and I hope you crush your goals in 2020!\n\n(And thank you kindly for the gold, silver, and vision \ud83d\udc95)",

Luckily with Rebel and the Enlightened Keto flavors, I have options when the craving hits. \n\nWhat helps is knowing that there are substitutes for most carby foods (low-carb wraps, cauliflower rice, fathead dough), so I don't feel like there are really any forbidden foods, just ones that require a few recipe adjustments.",

I am concerned even though it is keto, that it would flip that craving switch. Even though keto sweets are lower carb than real sweets, you still kind of have to watch portions, don't you?  Is there a temptation to eat too much? Most of my cravings for sweets, and food in general, went away. During the holidays, I wanted to try making some keto sweets, but didn't because of my concerns. Also, in the past, sugar alcohols have given me stomach and intestinal problems. Does the erythritol do that too?",

Most of the time they look a lot younger compared to their heavier weight. \n\nYour before picture and after looks like they could be mother and daughter (your after face looks younger than 34.) I'm curious if, when you lose another hundred pounds, if the de-aging will be as stark. Will it look like grandmother, mother, daughter? \n\nAnyway, good job. I was also impressed by the booty. A relative had a similar weight loss and she hates her butt. So I hope you don't hate yours.",

Maybe not so much when I was growing up but now that big booty is in style again I'm here for it.",

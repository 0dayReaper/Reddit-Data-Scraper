    "postText": "I started keto because of a brain tumor diagnosis and seizures. I have been doing a lot of research and have added various supplements to my diet and cleaned it up significantly. My diagnosis has not been confirmed despite a biopsy and advanced imaging. The doctors say that it is probably a tumor, but they don\u2019t know if it is the kind that will kill me. I\u2019m trying so hard to stay alive, but I recently looked at my inflammatory markers and they were very high. Maybe they will improve, but I could just use some encouragement right now. I feel helpless despite doing so much to be healthy.",

That's why I committed to lifelong keto - life is a lot more pain free, plus no acid reflux (mine used to be chronic and now it's pretty much non existent).",

You really want to work with a doctor who understands the science of cancer as it relates to diet for appropriate guidance.  There have been several excellent videos/interviews with the experts in the field recently on ketogenic diets and cancer - both treatment and prevention  - at both the Metabolic Mind and Adapt Your Life YouTube channels.   Start there, and good luck.",

One of my friends has had them for the last 2 decades, and another had them his entire life.  There is hope.\n\nYou might want to start anti-inflammatory additives.  *Ask your doctor before doing this,* as some inflammatory processes are good for you, ex, are required to fight tumors.  Think about:\n-\tTurmeric: start with straight Turmeric, then add Black Pepper extract to increase potency 20x if the first bottle is tolerated\n-\tvitamin C (1000 mg 2x/day)\n-\tOmega 3 fatty acids.\n\nAdd these, one at a time, and judge if stomach upset happens. Eliminate/reduce any that cause upset.  They all take a few days to work, and all have different purposes.\n\nI also suggest you *avoid* these keto foods until you are better:\n-\tfried foods\n-\tfrying oil (prefer olive oil)\n-\tprocessed meats (like sausage, snack sticks; prefer whole meats)\n-\tprocessed cheese (prefer cottage cheese, feta cheese)\n-\tpackaged snacks\n-\thigh-salt foods\nAll other keto foods are ok (eg, non inflammatory).",

I do take turmeric and omega 3s as well as low dose aspirin for inflammation. I have cut pretty much all processed food from my diet and have eliminated most dairy as well. I have done a little fasting, but I\u2019m working out being fully keto adapted before doing more. Honestly, it\u2019s tiring to put in so much effort, but it will be worth it if I can prevent this from growing. For context I am in my early forties and have young children so I\u2019m desperate to stay alive. I appreciate the support. I just needed to hear from someone today.",

Seyfried from the University of Boston, there's great videos of his talks on YouTube. He helped Pablo by providing him advice etc. He explains really well why keto shrinks tumours.\n\nAlso worth noting that a medical grade keto diet would be needed to be helpful, you have to watch your protein intake as well as carbs and both may need to be limited beyond what's recommended in some apps/by some posters on this thread as they may be giving the macros required for weightloss and not medical ketosis.\n\nBest of luck with your treatment and recovery.",

I\u2019ve cut carbs and sugar out of my diet due to insulin resistance and I\u2019ve been trying to find alternatives to flour/corn wraps and foods\n\nI started to make recipes with almond flour and eggs but I can\u2019t deal with the texture of either and the ones I\u2019ve tried I\u2019ve ended up wasting or giving away\n\nDoes anyone know of low carb alternatives to flour other than almond flour that are readily available?",

That makes sense, and isn\u2019t intrinsically about the healthiness of almonds as a source of nutrition. \n\nWhat I could see happening, though I\u2019ve not heard any reports of it, is adulterating almond flour with things like cellulose. It\u2019s expensive per pound, so adulterating it with less expensive ingredients to increase the profit margin might happen. I\u2019d look to imports from China sold by places like Walmart, which are historically lax about inspecting what the buy and sell.

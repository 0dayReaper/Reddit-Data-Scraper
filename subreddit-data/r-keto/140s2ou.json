    "postText": "I\u2019ve been eating clean and mostly paleo for about a decade so I am extremely sensitive to artificial tastes. I used to occasionally enjoy things sweetened with maple or birch syrups or honey. Now I am doing keto and it\u2019s been a month since I had anything sweet and this week decided to try and find some substitutes. Stevia and monkfruit made me want to hurl. I tried something with erythritol and it tasted cold. I tried xylitol and it was the same. Like rubbing an illegal white substance on my gums. I haven\u2019t tried allulose yet. Has anyone who wasn\u2019t previously a fan of processed foods found anything sweet that doesn\u2019t taste awful? I don\u2019t want to never have anything sweet again :(",

You can use it in your coffee if you like it sweetened, and you can use it to bake your own keto treats.",

So far, I like it and it doesn't start World War III with my gut. It's not as sweet as sugar but can be used in 1:1 ratio swap-out for sugar.",

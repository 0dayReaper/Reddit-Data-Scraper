    "postText": "I've been a longtime lurker here and when I initially started keto around 3 years ago, it really helped me out. Seeing all your success stories and advice helped me push through. I wanted to thank everyone with this post and maybe help anyone who's having doubts or feeling down with my own story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 years ago I was 500 pounds at my absolute worst. Went through a traumatic experience when I was 17 and afterwards the weight just seemed to add on over the years. I'd always been a big guy but it got really bad. Decided to start the keto diet after looking into healthier lifestyles and fast forward two years later (with intermittent fasting and gym training) I had lost 260 pounds. I kept under 1200 calories a day and the best feeling was not constantly being hungry. The last year has been more of a maintenance but with keto cycling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm at 240 now and actually weigh less than I did in high school. Have a decent amount of excess skin that skews my actual weight. Thankfully the government of Canada pays for plastic surgery in my case because it could lead to health problems in the future. Surgery is in about 8 or so months and I'm quite excited to start a completely new chapter of my life once it's done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never really planned this out and did the whole progress photo thing but I'll share some photos of me around my worst and some current photos for comparison. 6'3 if it means anything. I actually had photos of me bigger than these but my old phone is finished and cost too much to fix but this is still me NEAR my absolute largest.\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/jHyXoxL](https://imgur.com/gallery/jHyXoxL)\n\nNever posted here before so forgive me if something is wrong. All in all, just wanted to thank everyone here. It's been swell!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Wow this got more attention than I thought. Thank you everyone so much for the kind words! Noticed I wasn't smiling in any new photos lol so I added one with a KIND of smile. Never been one for smiling on queue, just can't seem to do it lol. Also realized I didn't put my age anywhere here. Currently 27 years old. Thank you kind stranger for the gold!\n\nEdit2: Wow this REALLY exploded more than I ever thought it would. Thank you all for the kind words. Initially I was nervous about posting this and after all this amazing feedback, I gotta say I don't know why. I've made the link public as well now, not going to hide haha. Thank you all! \n\nEdit3: Added a few midway photos as that was requested by some and for some reason I didn't think to add them initially.\n\nEdit4: Wow, the imgur post I made went viral and on the front page. Thank you all so much for the kind words! Really did NOT expect this reaction, kinda freaking out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for the gold and platinum awards!!",

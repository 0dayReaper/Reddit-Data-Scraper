    "postText": "Hey all, nurse here. I\u2019ve read all about magnesium here and different bioavailabilities from different forms, such as magnesium glycinate and threonate being highly available while other formulations are not. \nWe care for patients with critically low electrolyte levels pretty regularly, and we replace them as needed. Normally if a patient\u2019s electrolytes are critically low (critically low meaning the serum levels are low enough that they start to become symptomatic), the body will \u201cgrab\u201d any and all of that electrolyte it can. \nToday I\u2019m caring for a patient who presented with a magnesium level of 0.6, normal being 1.8 to 2.2. This is low enough to cause heart arrhythmias, so I gave them 800 mg of magnesium oxide on an empty stomach per our protocol. After a recheck 4 hours later, the patient\u2019s magnesium levels were 0.5. \nThe level went down. The pt was in a symptomatic state of hypomagnesia where their body should absorb and hold onto any and all magnesium they received, and magnesium oxide didn\u2019t raise their levels at all. We then gave the patient magnesium sulfate (an IV form) and their magnesium levels corrected. Just an N=1 account of how useless magnesium oxide is.",

I\u2019m not a doctor, but have supplemented with magnesium for decades, so, anecdotally, I would say you\u2019d likely be fine starting with 400mg or so a day and working up from there over a period of a few weeks (if you\u2019re looking to correct a deficiency - then taper back to the RDA).",

Doesn\u2019t do much for muscle relaxation, and is best supplemented with other forms. \n\nCitrate has great availability, but is widely used for constipation (never trying you again, Citrate!). \n\nGlycinate/bisglysinate is great, helps tremendously with muscle cramps and/or sleep, as others have said. \n\nTaurate is easy on the stomach, has great bio availability and has proven itself highly effective in heart arrhythmia treatment and overall cardiovascular health. Also greatly helps lowering blood pressure. \n\nMalate has benefits in overall energy production, and is widely used early in the day in people with fatigue. \n\nOrotate is said to also have a Threonate-like effect, though I\u2019m not exactly sure what it does right now. \n\nBut I never understood why hospitals opted for Oxide and it\u2019s low bio availability in treating low levels of magnesium.

Like when protein companies mix two or three plant based proteins to come up with a complete protein that has all the amino acids, or multivitamins. It makes logical sense, but lemme know if you try it I guess.",

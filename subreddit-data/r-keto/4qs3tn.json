This led to discovering Zerocarb by accident which I've followed for the last year, it's gotten me down to my lowest weight in 15 years. It's conflicting because we get so bombarded with the mantra that you must eat vegetables if you want to be healthy but after researching zerocarb I no longer believe they are 100% necessary. Best part about zerocarb is I have no cravings and almost no appetite. I still screw up every now and then and have some ups and downs, but zerocarb is easier for me.

It's fast and simple and I almost always have eggs and tuna on hand.  You can mix in whatever spices you like, or add a few leaves of spinach or kale, or put some bacon on top.  Lots of options.",

Similar practical and financial situations.\n\nSo perhaps it's due to that skipjack in particular? Different concentrations of toxins due to species size, age, etc. \n\nLike I said, just riffing here. Would love to have an authority chime in. ",

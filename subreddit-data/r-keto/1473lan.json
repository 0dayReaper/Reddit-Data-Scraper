If so how long did it take to see improvement?",

It seems like it depends but the average for most benefits hit at the 3 month mark. And some luckier people, report a couple weeks or some mood improvements.\n\nAnd with mental health benefits, supposedly you\u2019d have to go into nutritional ketosis/therapeutic ketosis which is the stricter protocol - 5% carbs/20carbs. But again everybody works differently- some people adapted quicker, some slower. Some can go with more carbs, some less. It\u2019s trial and error.",

Keto had 0 difference on my hormone cycles, it might have made my periods slightly lighter, but it\u2019s hard to tell. \n\nI know these things are not advised medically, but I think what helped me most was a good B vitamin complex, particularly with b6. Carnivore might be good for this because organ meat is rich in b vitamins. I have bad pms when I haven\u2019t been taking it. Bad pms can be managed, the diet might help but it might not, it might make it worse. I need more carbs in the days before my period, which is normal on Keto. You also won\u2019t stay in ketosis when you are menstruating.",

Do you have a diagnosed mental health issue to which you've been prescribed medications or are you seeking to avoid going the route of going to a provider and seeking medication management? I only ask because some people here will say keto helps with mental clarity and mood, but lots of these people don't have a clinical diagnosis and are speaking colloquially. Your results may vary depending on your specific medical situation. \n\nGetting relief for menstruation-related hormone fluctuations and how that manifests (e.g., lots of people report their cramping is way less severe on keto) will probably be person-to-person. Did you see any improvement the last time you were on keto/carnivore? That will be your answer. \n\nOverall, I can't see the harm in trying to make this change.",

I've recently had my hormones checked. Still waiting for results if I have high testosterone. No medical issues such as endo, or pcos. Just really bad mood swings when my time comes. \n\nI can't really remember last time. I was on antidepressants at the time so can't say if it helped or not since I obviously had some help.",

BC is a convenient solution, but it clearly is not a good one for you (and it sounds like they didn't explore all your options).\n\nI say, why not try it now that you are not on the antidepressants? Just set realistic expectations (might still have mood swings, but not as a severe).",

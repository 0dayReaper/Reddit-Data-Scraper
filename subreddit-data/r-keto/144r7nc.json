    "postText": "Been doing keto for a year. Stopped 6 months in for 3 months and now 3 months at it again. I've done keto before this as well but wasn't as serious. \n\nI'm pre diabetic, fatty liver, and elevated iron in my blood.\n\n5'11\" 228LBs as of today, started at 270.\n\nI dont actively workout, but I have a very physical job. I install elevators.\n\n\nI drink a beef or chicken bouillon cube in the morning before work, I only drink water after that. I take a 64 oz and a 40 oz thermos with water I drink from all day. Fill as needed. Almost every other day my 40 oz water has a lime and 2 tsb of apple cider vinegar in it.\n\nAfter work I've been getting a muscle milk protein shake from the gas station. For no particular reason other then i started craving it. \n\nDinner is a half pound of ground chicken seasoned and once or twice a week I'll do a half pound ground beef as a burger patty. Always with a side of greenbeans.\n\n\nAnyone who's been doing this have and suggestions? Add anything remove anything? I'm dropping weight at a rate I'm happy with. Goal is 200 by end of year.",

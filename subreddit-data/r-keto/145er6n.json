    "postText": "To start off, my experience with keto started when I was 200lbs (19F). I did it over the course of 8 months and then dropped to 120lbs.\n\nOver the course of 4 years I\u2019ve put on about 15lbs and am wanting to nip it in the butt before it gets worse. \n\nI\u2019m currently on day 3 of an egg fast that I\u2019m using as a jumpstart back into the keto lifestyle and have lost about 5lbs so far. \nWhile this sounds amazing, I did an InBody scan and learned that I\u2019ve actually put on roughly 2% body fat since starting and have also decreased in muscle mass. \n\nWhile doing the egg fast I have also incorporated 20 minutes of StairMaster followed by about 40 minutes of lifting weights. I had started this about 2 weeks before my egg fast and have continued to do the same regimen while on my egg fast. \n\nOver the last 2.5 weeks I have seen an increase in the amount of weight I\u2019m able to lift so I\u2019m a bit confused as to how my body fat has increased and muscle mass has decreased. \n\nWhile weight loss is always my main goal - I am looking to get more toned, I don\u2019t want to be skinny fat. At my best, I was 123lbs and 19% body fast, and I would love to get back into that range. \n\nAny tips given the information I\u2019ve provided? Thanks in advance!\n\n(P.S. I know the InBody scan isn\u2019t 100% accurate, but it is the only form of measurement I have accessible to me at this time and I am okay with it being a \u201crough estimate\u201d as to where I\u2019m at)",

If anything you can use to to track a long term trend but even then take the results loosely.They are affected by changes in body water content which happens a lot while keto.\n\nEating only eggs is in no way a fast, its a keto/carnivore diet if anything and would likely put you in ketosis in roughly the same amount of time as eating a regular keto diet so feel free to jump straight to eating keto and start finding something sustainable for you.",

It\u2019s not consistent. You\u2019re assuming the \u201cestimate\u201d is always going to trend in the same direction or that your first estimate was a good baseline.\n\nThese scans can\u2019t distinguish accurately between water, muscle mass and fat, which means that changes in your level of hydration from one day to the next will give you different results. \n\nEven DEXA is not 100% accurate, it\u2019s just at least consistent enough to be used directionally for study results.",

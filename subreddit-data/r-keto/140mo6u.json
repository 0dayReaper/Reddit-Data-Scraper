Anyone got any good quick and easy recipes which are really low in carbs and don\u2019t require many ingredients? Or any tips how they got over the sweet cravings \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

That longing for a hit of something sweet can pop up when you least expect it to. You will have to accept that you are an addict and work to actively manage your addiction. That may mean avoiding situations where sugar is freely available and your participation is expected. It may mean having appropriate food readily available to you. It absolutely means being vigilant about your limitations and weaknesses. \n\nHow do I know this? Hello. I am Serena. I have been keto for 6 years, and I am a sugar addict.",

Continuation of consuming such products are fine for some, but makes you crave more for others (like myself)\n\nI just went cold turkey on all processed foods and snacks and diet sodas. I also started OMAD. Few days in and hunger for anything was gone. Would be an idea to look into OMAD.",

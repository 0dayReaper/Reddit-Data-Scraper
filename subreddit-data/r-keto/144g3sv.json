    "postText": "I\u2019ve been doing great on keto. It\u2019s been amazing to be free of hunger and I\u2019ve lost 30lb in two months. \n\nBut this week I tried to raise my game by replacing my one spoonful of sugar in my morning coffee with aspartame.\n\nI\u2019ve been starving all week to the point of wanting to cry, it\u2019s wretched. I haven\u2019t given on but I\u2019m miserable. I am wondering if anybody has found this as well? I\u2019ve never taken sweetners before so can\u2019t compare it to anything else. Has anybody else found this!",

It works for me personaly, I\u2019d take 1 or 2 cans of Coca-Cola Zero a week and find it really satiating if I feel hungry between lunch and dinner time. \n\nMy guess is it\u2019s all on emotional level. Look at keto like eliminating sugar not spending time and effort at searching for a replacement. Keto is not forever, it is a tool (at least for me) to defend against \u201cthe common enemy\u201d.

Something like that. I\u2019ve never had that issue honestly. It could be a reflex response to old habits you let go of when you started keto. Habits leave a major mark. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t do keto fast food options because it triggers a response in me.",

When I need a sugar hit, I eat a spoon of peanut butter.\n\nIf I were coffee drinker, I would probably slip a knifefull of peanut butter into my coffee.\n\nAs it is, I swallow a caffeine tablet  when I need a wake-up.",

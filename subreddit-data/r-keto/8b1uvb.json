    "postText": "http://imgur.com/p1Qfh50\n\nI was the maid of honor in my best friends wedding 3 years ago. I hated myself. I was one of the biggest girls in the bridal party and was so embarrassed. So when my brother got engaged I knew I wouldn't be the fat bridesmaid again. I struggled with different diets and tried different prescription diet pills and lost 10-15 pounds but still felt awful. Then my brother, who saw my struggle introduced me to this subreddit. I gave keto my all and the weight came off quickly! I still have about 20 pounds to go but with the stress of this wedding behind me it should come off quickly again.",

PERIOD. \n\n- stop eating potatoes, rice, grains and their derivatives like bread and pasta\n\n- stop eating fruit (because it's just a natural form of sugar and NO SUGAR)\n\n- if after making these changes you feel like snacking at all, try a palm-sized amout of nuts or seeds\n\n- Eat just until full (satiety). Don't eat again until you're really hungry. \n\nMost people doing so called \"lazy keto\" just follow these rules and, without otherwise tracking macros or counting calories, find that the weight and the headaches drop away quickly. \n\nYou might experience a couple of days of feeling weak or like you have a cold, but that is just your body switching from being a sugar junky to being normal again. \n\nMore details can be found in the description section of this Reddit.

In basic terms: it's a very low carb, high protein, higher fat diet/lifestyle. With the amount of carbs we typically eat now (sometimes up in the couple hundred gram range a day.), our bodies have adjusted to using carbs as energy and burn it when given the chance, while storing fat as a \"reserve.\" On keto, you adjust your diet enough (&lt;20-25g carbs a day) so that your body starts using fat for that energy source instead, putting your body into the state of \"ketosis,\" hence the diet name. Ketosis is a natural thing the human body does, keto just keeps you in it to continually burn fat. Food consists mostly of meat, dairy, greens, SOME vegetables and fruits (you'd be surprised how many carbs are in some), and if you still get sugar cravings: artificial sweeteners. It worked wonders for me and many others I know and in this sub. If you have any sort of diabetic condition though, make sure you consult your doctor first or do REGULAR checkups, as it can drastically change your glucose levels. ",

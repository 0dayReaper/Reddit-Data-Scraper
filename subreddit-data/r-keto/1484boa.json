Other than my brother\u2019s wedding in October, I\u2019m doing this because i\u2019m tired of feeling like crap in the morning. I weighed in on 06/05 at 314.6, and today I weighed in at 305.4! I\u2019m super excited to keep going and i\u2019m ready for this change. \n\nIf you have any tips for me, I\u2019d love to hear them!",

            "comment": "Definitely try to combine it with some exercise, it will catapult you into ketosis faster plus you will feel like a superhuman. The power and endurance you'll have on keto is simply mind blowing. Plus you will also build muscle while loosing fat at the same time ;)\n\nSecondly after a few weeks you can try to combine it with intermittent fasting. So you basically eat all your meals in a certain time window like 8 hours and then fast for the remaining 16 hours. It will also boost ketosis very strongly and you will loose fat faster, for shure!\n\nHope this helps. You got this man!!",

Since then only another 5 lbs more. I am not obese: 5'4\", 137 lbs, age 60. But another 10 lbs off would be ideal. Started kickboxing 2 months ago and average daily step count is around 8000. I have cut bread, rice, tortillas, cereal, chips. Emphasize protein and healthy fat, lots of salad, substituted almonds for snacks. So should I expect to be in keto all the time? It seems that it takes about 24 hours to get back in ketosis after eating. I do track my eating with MyFitnessPal and every other health metric on Fitbit. Confused about where to go from here to get that last 10. Am healthy but was pre-diabetic which was the motivator. Supplement: Multivit/mineral, Turmeric, Alpha Lipoic acid, Fish oil.",

Don\u2019t be in a hurry to lose it too fast. Regular fitness with elevated heart rate is key. For me, extended cardio (over an hour)  works best for fat burning.",

Exercise will help but don\u2019t depend on it for fat loss. I gained weight when I would ride my bike to work over 30 miles round trip. Riding hard too, not just cruising. Watch videos on why seed oils, sugar and preservatives are bad for you to keep yourself motivated to stay on track. You may want to consider carnivore but it\u2019s not necessary. It works for some people but we all need to figure out what works best for us as individuals.",

So it's definitely possible.\n\n**It will be difficult but there's some things to help you.**\n\n**a) What's your current daily calories &amp; macros?** Calories should be **max** current bodyweight x12 and **minimum** current bodyweight x9. Macros should be: 75% fats, 20% protein, 5% carbs.\n\n**b) If you're not using one already, use MyFitnessPal.** Everything gets logged in. Use your phone for good (not evil) ... I found that I could eat at McDonalds twice a week and stay in ketosis just by checking out the foods in the app before i ordered them...\n\nc) the cool thing about keto is that you're not switching between glucose (when you're eating) and ketones (when you haven't eaten for 12+ hours (like in the morning).  You're constantly burning the same energy source 24/7. **To make sure you stay in ketosis, put a tablespoon of MCT oil in your morning black coffee.** **Add butter if you want (but put in a blender) and you get bulletproof coffee.** You can drink this before breakfast, or 3-4 hours before your 1st meal. It'll help your body metabolize fats for fuel for 20+ hours.\n\nMost ppl fail keto - but it sounds like you know what you're doing. Goodluck and DM me if you have questions.",

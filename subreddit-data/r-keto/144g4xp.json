    "postText": "I started keto 4 yrs ago and over the course of one year, lost 70 lbs. I stalled at that and was ok with it with only 10 lbs away from my goal. \nMy maintenance was OMAD. \nIn the last year a met my BF and kinda fell of the wagon. I ate twice a day with him and it was a switch to low carb rather than keto. I gained back 40lbs in the last year.\nI started back on keto, very strict. Monitoring everything on carb manager. To no avail.\nSo i thought i try a extended liquid fast. For the last 10 days I'm having keto protein and 2 cups of broth, plenty of water a day. I went into ketosis on day 4. I haven't lost an oz.\nThis just doesn't make sense. I should lose just simply through the calorie deficit. I'm so frustrated. Any advise/encouragement?",

Also drink lots of water, to keep you full and help your body function properly. My gf had the same issue, didn't lose a lb for like a month, then one day she just started losing slowly. Check hormones too. Women tend to retain water when they're on their period and men can retain water when they have higher estrogen. (I'm on TRT and I retained alot of water when my estrogen rose in response to the test)",

It must be incredibly frustrating after having had a huge success in the beginning. \n\nCaloric deficits are great to break a stall, but you need to give your body time and being abrupt (liquid fast) out of the blue might put a bigger strain on your body and when there is stress, there\u2019s cortisol and your body won\u2019t budge an ounce. \n\nHaving said that, I would try the following: \n\n* focus on fats and protein the first 3-6 weeks. Make sure these are natural sources (no keto labeled stuff!). Eat as boring as possible: meat/protein + lettuce + source of fat (olive oil)\n\n* don\u2019t focus on a caloric deficit yet! Be gentle; the body reacts better when you are loving and gentle with it. After you start being in ketosis for a long time then set the caloric deficits. Being extreme can easily turn into an eating disorder \n\n* once you are in consistent ketosis (for a week) then reshuffle your macros and increase protein. The more fat you have on your body, the less you should eat so that your body eats your reserves.\n\n* weigh everything! And leave your carbs at max 15gr net\n\n* have a lot of PATIENCE! If it worked once, it will work again, your body is most probably stressed because of the sudden shift so be gentle :) \n\nTalking from my journey and experience, I know you want it to go NOW, but that it won\u2019t happen nor is it sustainable if it does.",

I did it and found it really helpful.I would also think about not only limiting your carbs, which obviously you already do, but also timing your carbs, so that they always come at the end of your meal, after you have consumed enough fat and protein and fiber to lay down a matrix against the carbs being absorbed quickly.I don't know if you do strength training, and I don't really think that strength training actually helps people shed the pounds, but it's very good for our Health and Longevity, if we're looking beyond that number on the scale and thinking more about Wellness in general. Peter Attia's new book on wellness is very helpful, I think.",

Im a first time ketoer, but ive seen a lot of losts like urs. Im 5'2 btw, so smaller than u are. Im cureenrky doing mote of a high protien adequate fat keto to get to msintenamce level weight . \n\nI did start with standard high fat adequate protuen keto which i did all last year. As my progress slowed, i figured that ladt 50 ish pounds required a switch up.\n\nAdults, especially women need at least 90g complete protien daily. With ut fadt, ur well under that.\n\nUr non fadt cals id say should be more aroubd 1400-1500 as opposed to the 1800 uve been doing. Im doing 1315 cals myself and am half a foot smaller than u so id estimate ud need at least around 100 cals more than me, possibly 200 based on our size difference. Also, post menapausal womrn need more protuen than pre menapausal, or menstrating like myself to avoid bone and muscle loss. So make sure u get the at least 90g of complete protiem in. \n\nPro tip, if u pair incomplete protien like bone broth with a complete protien like meat they both absorb like complete protien.\n\nIm not a fan of hoe low ur carbs are, but if thats what works for ur needs im not gonna really object. Though definatly up ur protuen and fat to get adequate fuel and cals in. \n\nDefinatly dont do such wild fasts, especially for days. Between the life stress and fasts ur really semding cortisol through the roof. U wrnt from extreme emotional/mental stress with essentially msintenance cals to the mental/emotional stress plus starvation mode cals for days which will only raise ur elevated cortisol more tgrowing things more haywire.\n\nU badically went from one stressful extreme to the opposite. Not good at all. \n\nU need to first deal with the mental and emotional stress, then do different cals and adjust ur macros accordingly. If u really want do do something to reset ur meyabolism, do carnivore for a month or at leadt a couple weeks to stabalize things. Then go back to keto with the 1400-1500 cal range, at least 90g complete protirn a day, and i guess ur 8 g carn limit, cover the rest with fat. See if this helps. If ur hungry with that, lower fat and up ur protien For satiety . \n\nHope this helps op.",

I had to wran diwn from a 50g carb limit . I stopped wraning at 30g. My protien intake right now is 148 g minimum, and my fat limit is 67g. \n\nMy ratios on macros, if u use that, is undet 10% from carbs, and just under 50% of caloric intake from both fat and protien. \n\nBut remember, im doing a more high protien keto, with adequate fat. With high fat keto u want at most 10% caloric intake from carbs, at least 50% from fat, and at most 40% from protien.\n\nSome do better with 10% or less from carbs, 60% fron fat, with 30% caloric intake from protien by ratio. Thats not measuring in grams. Take those ratios with aacro calc and figure what works for u. If u eant to keep the 8 g carbs, adjust the protien and fat ratios around that and the needed cal intake. Play around a bit to find what numbers in g and what ratio of fat to protien fits ur needs and goals.",

She has tons of free information, as well as a health assessment you can purchase (along with other supplement plans for whatever challenges you might have). She also has many cookbooks and YouTube videos making her recipes. She and her husband Craig are a God send for anyone looking to really improve their health and lose weight/fat as a result.\n\nFrom them, I learned to implement 1-3 Protein Sparing Modified Fast days per week, keep your TOTAL carbs under 20g (10g will get you quicker results), cut out ALL dairy and nuts. Get your macros right using their calculator and I guarantee you, my friend, that you'll lose all the weight and spare your muscle, while losing fat. It worked for me!! \n\nI occasionally eat dairy and nuts (not a lot though) and have gone over my macros (carbs, fat and protein) many times and STILL dropped more than half my dress size. I started at womens size US18 and am now a size US6. I started 198lbs and now at weight 142lbs. And this is with hardly any exercise at all, within 8 months. If I were to exercise regularly, as I should have been, I would have dropped faster. My next move is too do more strength training to generate more autophagy and build muscle faster. \n\nI can't recommend Maria and Craig Emmerich enough. They changed my life! I am certain, with their guidance, you will reach your goals.\n\nI hope you reach your goals either way. I've been where you are and I know how discouraging it can feel. Keep going and don't give up! Don't let any bumps in the road or failures prevent you from reaching your goal. Just keep going my friend. Praying for you!",

You might understand that, since you are gemtruckermom, right? I could have used Delta1, but the adopted \"D\" in my organization was David.\n\nI am a 38 y/o female that has gone through 6 full term pregnancies, all natural deliveries, all babies breast fed. No, I have not gone through menopause, but might very well be entering perimenopause, if you want to be all up in my business. \n\nMy hormones have wreaked havoc on me because I've had 6 children within a 10 year window. So, I know a thing or two about weight struggles, let alone mental and emotional struggles. I have, as a matter of fact, been through weight gain, obesity, chronic pain from inflammation, depression, anxiety, hormonal malfunction and much more. \n\nHow dare you try to take away from well intentioned advice for another person (YOU, in this case) who is struggling to meet their goals. \n\nShame on you for causing others pain when you should be supportive and positive, instead of this negative comment you left. But then maybe this is why you will never reach your goals and you are in the boat you're in.\n\nEven with this, I hope you eventually get there. But, you definitely offended me.",

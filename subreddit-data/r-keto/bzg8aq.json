    "postText": "I rent a small house on a very large piece of land that is shared with the property owners (they are on the other side). I have access to any of the gardens, orchards, firepits, etc. This morning my landlady was in one of the gardens and I went to chat with her.  She often offers me homemade pie, bread, etc.  which I used to accept and then give to someone else.  A few weeks ago I finally told her about keto and she's been cordial but seems slightly concerned.  This morning she was planting  potatoes and she said, \"Are you still on that crazy diet?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"So I imagine you don't eat potatoes.\"  \"No.\"  \"Or my pie.\"  \"No.\"  \"So it's more like a lifestyle now.\"  \"Exactly.  I really don't even have any cravings anymore.\"  She asked exactly what I did eat.  And we got into a discussion about the food and only eating when hungry.  About an hour later she came knocking on my door.  She made me a completely Keto broccoli, ham and cheese omelette and almond flour muffin.  She had gone out on the internet to find out what I could eat and get recipes!!!!   \"Now don't eat this until you are actually hungry!\"  I almost cried from this support out of left field for this \"crazy diet.\"",

I was too young to be into either (still not tbh) and I was so jealous of my brother and cousins. It really made me mad that they were getting exactly what I wanted and nobody would put enough effort into knowing me to realize that I hated the girly stuff. I think it was just because my extended family wanted me to be more girly. Bad move. I thought they'd understand that I didn't like that if I acted really tomboyish so that probably just stoked the flames. In the end it only put some internalized misogyny in me I think. \n\nI mean now I appreciate any gifts but I kinda wish that my grandma was like hers.",

    "postText": "I've decided to try a diet tracker and have browsed posts about favorite apps. But it sounds like most apps for keto are mainly only tracking fat, protein and carbs. I also want to track essential vitamins and minerals that I consume. Is there an app that tracks it all? I don't care about recipes and goals. I just want to make sure I'm getting proper nutrition while staying low carb.\nThanks in advance!",

I have a medication tracker, as well as physical measurements. I have the premium subscription,  so I can also import recipes from the web and the app will create nutritional labels for logging.\n\nI think once you get the names of a few apps, which one you go with will be which you can relate to best.",

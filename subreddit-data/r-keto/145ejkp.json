They are great on a breakfast plate. And the best part is they are usually dirt cheap",

But the more you cook them the closer to \u201cpotato\u201d you get imo. The more they cook the less spicy radish taste they are. They will soak up whatever flavor you cook them in.

Don\u2019t be scared to put a dish of lasagna or ribs or chicken or anything you want in it like you would a normal oven, just smaller. Food doesn\u2019t have to be put in the basket directly! Took me a while to realise this isn\u2019t a fat free deep fryer! Ps: air fryer anything isn\u2019t the same as deep fried anything! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Keto loves deep frying (in the right oil).",

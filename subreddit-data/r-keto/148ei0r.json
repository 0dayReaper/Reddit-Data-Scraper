    "postText": "hi everyone! \n\ni have been working to lose some weight for the past month. i\u2019ve been strength training and trying to watch what i eat. I have lost maybe 2lbs since starting, and I\u2019ve tried to focus on eating more protein and significantly lowering carbs. \n\nI recently started my period earlier than normal with absolutely 0 PMS symptoms. that never happens to me. Usually I am tired, bloated, feel chest soreness, hungry etc beforehand. Fast forward to today, and I am now on Day 10 of my period and am just a little confused about what is going on, usually I only have it for 7 days. Sorry if this is TMI i am just a little worried. \n\nHas anyone had this experience?",

            "comment": "My first keto period lasted 54 straight days and I was convinced I was dying from the inside out. About threeweeks into this 7+ week nightmare, I made an appointment with my OB. She said everything looked fine, and  advised me to keep doing what I\u2019m doing because at that point I\u2019d dropped like 30lbs, and weight loss could really only help the uterine cyst issues I\u2019d been having. \n\nI followed her advice and I\u2019m SO glad I did, because I was close to quitting keto altogether before that appointment.  I was freaked beyond belief, and frustrated to hell too. Bleeding all the time sucks ass. \n\nI ended up with 2 weeks of glorious blood-free normality before the bleeding started again, and lasted nearly 3 more weeks. \n\nBUT...that was the last of the reproductive chaos.  From that point on, my periods were lighter, less painful, and predictable to the day for the first time in my ENTIRE life. \n\nThroughout this whole ordeal I felt amazing, I was losing weight, I had a ton of energy and didn\u2019t have menstrual pain like I always did before. Now I\u2019m 80lbs lighter, halfway through year six of keto, and everything is peachy keen. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb Obviously if you\u2019re worried, *please* go see a doctor, but this is a thing that happens (and it\u2019s highly doubtful you\u2019ll have the train wreck of an experience that I did anyway)!",

It took four months before I saw less than 11 days but then it stabilized and then changed again because I had lost so much weight by then (in April). I notice that my weight does change how I have a period. At lower weight it\u2019s only 2 days and light barely there noticeable. You do have to give it some time and then it should go to regular.",

It actually is the reason that I stopped the first time even though I lost a good deal of weight. I had my first period after starting back up again and it was again horrible. Super nauseous for the first couple days, super heavy bleeding and much longer than normal. I don't have any answers but just trying to stick it out this time and pray that it gets better with time.",

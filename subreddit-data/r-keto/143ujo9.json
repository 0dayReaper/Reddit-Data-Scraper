    "postText": "Hello everyone! \n\nI've tried keto before and it didn't work for me. I have high sensitivity to fat rich foods, so I was nauseous all day, the whole time I was on a keto diet. I lost a lot of weight in 2.5 months (combined with light exercise) but eventually I just gave up cause I was miserable.\n\nFast forward 4 years and here I am wanting to get pregnant, but also at my heaviest weight ever. I'm 35, 5'9 (175cm) tall and currently 120kg. I need to lose about 30-40kg because I'm unhappy AF and I also want to give my body a better chance at having a \"normal\" pregnancy. Also I'd prefer to not have all the health issues associated with long term obesity when I'm older. (I've been overweight since I was 14yo).\n\nI occasionally eat fish and chicken, but that's it and I remember not being able to eat meat at all when I did keto 4 years ago from being nauseous all the time. Any meat just smelled and tasted rotten all the time I was on keto, which I figure is cause I was always so nauseous.\n\nI don't know if it's even worth trying keto again, but before I make a decision I wanted to hear from people who aren't big meat eaters either (and somewhat lactose intolerant, forgot to mention that) how do you manage? What is your main source of protein? Also, any tips for feeling less nauseous while eating such a high fat diet? \n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "The only meat I will really eat is chicken breast and bacon (sometimes pepperoni) and I\u2019ve eaten keto since 2017. Maybe chicken would be more palatable in a recipe with a lot of other flavors? \n\nI eat a lot of casseroles using these two meats and some variety of cream cheese/cheese/veggies mixed in ([this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/k856l9/i_call_it_jalape%C3%B1o_popper_chicken_casserole/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) has been my favorite the last few months). I enjoy breakfast for dinner, scrambled eggs with cheese and bacon, salsa, avocado, a low carb tortilla or two. Sometimes I\u2019ll have [something fresh](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ketomealseatingnow/comments/l4ztry/the_freshest_of_all_salads/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) as heck with my meals too. So so good. \n\nI figured out how to turn the classic pork [egg roll in a bowl](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ketomealseatingnow/comments/i1x13v/sesame_chicken_bowl_shredded_and_juicythanks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) into a chicken version...I do a lot of meat-swapping with recipes. [Lewis Bake Shop keto bread](https://www.lewisbakeshop.com/product/healthy-life-keto-bread) has been a high-protein staple for me for years now as well, I like making sandwiches and grilled cheese with it, and it makes an AMAZING [French toast](https://imgur.com/a/TwgDchI). \n\nTofu is a staple for me as far as protein goes. It is wonderful when you [air-fry it](https://imgur.com/a/HqsHEgv) and toss it with a [low carb Asian G Hughes sauce](https://www.amazon.com/Hughes-Sugar-Free-Assorted-Marinades/dp/B07PTNWGWP/ref=asc_df_B07PTNWGWP/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=242036135207&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=16703436983115545919&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=m&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9013165&amp;hvtargid=pla-682463085998&amp;psc=1). I also like mixing a good high quality protein powder with cottage cheese and berries to help with protein intake, it is a delicious protein bomb!\n\nIn conclusion: keto is completely sustainable when you\u2019re picky as hell. \ud83d\ude04 \n\nEdit: keto is NOT necessarily a high fat diet, especially if weight loss is your goal. I\u2019ve been eating more protein than fat since I started. Please read our FAQ and beginners guide to learn about the importance of protein as a goal and fat as a limit!:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/keto_in_a_nutshell",

Also you can take ox bile supplements with fatty meals, an enzyme that can help you digest the fats. \n\nNausea is common. I had it the first few months. Ox bile helped me a lot. You have to slowly teach your gut to digest fats, your gut is not producing the right amount of biles and enzymes to break it down rn.",

You can eat lots of poultry, fish, eggs, tofu and vegetables and get all the fat you need from olive and avocado oil, nuts, seeds and nut butters. The nausea you were experiencing may have been an electrolyte problem. Be sure you get lots of sodium, potassium and magnesium, especially in the first few months. A certain amount of nausea/loss of appetite is to be expected when you\u2019re changing your diet so substantially. You might have to power through a bit if that no matter what.",

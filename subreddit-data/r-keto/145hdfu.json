    "postText": "Still new to keto.  My understanding is that off all artificial sweeteners, stevia is among the healthiest.  I agree that it does make things sweet, albeit a little odd tasting.  It does quash any sweet cravings I might have periodically.  I use it sparingly and only for that purpose.\n\n\nI'm always hesitant on something that's too good to be true.  Are there any negative effects?  (I.e. Does it trick the body to make insulin)",

Its great to have stevia as you are getting started on the keto diet because it can help you have foods that are still sweet without ruining everything. But many people as they go on in keto, find their pallet adjusts and they need less and less sweeteners as they go on.\n\nIt is purely a way to get off sugar, really. So have it as long as you still need it. In a ketogenic metabolism, it will not have any ill effects.",

So glad I figured it out, can't eat my favourite sugar free chocolate any more :( less calories, though.",

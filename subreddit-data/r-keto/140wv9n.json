    "postText": "I wanted to post some numbers from my blood test for anyone interested to see what the results were before starting keto and after being on keto.\n\nSome background:  prior to keto, I was on a very poor working mans diet.  Fast food, microwavable meals, pastas, breads, snacks, sweets, etc., etc., with the occasional home cooked meal.\n\nOn keto I mainly concentrate on animal proteins and fats with occasional vegetables or fruits.  I do not eat any \"keto\" products, just real whole foods.  I rarely have cheat days.  (mothers day was an exception)  I eat all parts of an animal to get all the nutritional benefits.  Any cut of meat, skin, organs meats and animal fat, etc.  I find this to be a great balance and makes me feel better than just sticking with a few cuts of meat.  No supplements, electrolytes, etc.\n\nI do not measure or count anything.  I do not have a weight scale.  I go by what my body feels it needs.  I find that I will crave a specific meal, like liver or heart and I make sure I satisfy this craving in the following meals.  I understand this is different than some people as they measure and calculate everything, but this works for me.  I only eat when I am hungry.  A few times, this means I fast for a period of 24+ hours and occasionally, I have three meals in one day.  I do not schedule any meals.  Once, I woke up at 0300 because I was craving eggs, so I made eggs.  Work does skew this a bit but adding a few hours to the fast isn't an issue for me.  I drink some water and it keeps me going until I can have a meal.\n\nEDIT:  Original results were taken January 2023.  Keto Journey started around February.  Updated results June 2023.\n\n# CHOL\n\n* Standard Range: 35 - 199 mg/dL\n* before: **259**\n* after: 116\n\n# HDL\n\n* Standard Range: &gt;=35 mg/dL\n* before: **28**\n* after: 38\n\n# LDL (calculated)\n\n* Standard Range: 10 - 129 mg/dL\n* before: **&gt;400** which invalidates the results\n* after: 69\n\n# Triglyceride\n\n* Standard Range: &lt;=199 mg/dL\n* before: **459**\n* after: 96\n\n# VLDL (calculated)\n\n* Standard Range: 0 - 40 mg/dL\n* before:  **&gt;400** which invalidates the results\n* after: 19\n\n# CL\n\n* Standard Range: 98 - 108 mmol/L\n* before: 100\n* after: 102\n\n# CO2\n\n* Standard Range: 22 - 32 mmol/L\n* before: 26\n* after: 27\n\n# Potassium\n\n* Standard Range: 3.5 - 5.3 mmol/L\n* before: 3.2\n* after: 4.3\n\n# Sodium\n\n* Standard Range: 135 - 145 mmol/L\n* before: 137\n* after: 136",

This 2nd time around, I'm focusing much more on what I am craving and when.  I find myself more credible on cravings since I am doing this alcohol and maryjane free so far.  :)",

Ride out the *two* days of carb withdrawal that causes serious cravings (continue to hydrate and eat the keto foods, no seed oils). Use ketoade to increase your sodium and water. It's the same for many. Carb withdrawal happens whenever you go out of ketosis and return to keto; or when you start keto. But it's only a couple of days.\n\nThere are some real stuff happening that can be managed; carb withdrawal, electrolytes imbalance, dopamine/hormesis balancing, etc. There are tasty keto pizza recipes. You can use hot pepper flakes for the dopamine without the side effects of sugar. KCKO",

I\u2019ve since learned what I was doing wrong and I hit a plateau and my cholesterol is like yours was so Dr who is no help but threw statins my way . For others who are on the fence it\u2019s absolutely true that one stops cravings for crap or unhealthy food and I can tell you once out of ketosis the brain goes right back to it, Like alcohol I used to drink daily ,stopped as soon as I injected within short period of time I\u2019d be right back to binge drinking, Food I became a binge eater haha mostly in privacy .It\u2019s a horrible way to live so kudos if you get the live clean Now message !",

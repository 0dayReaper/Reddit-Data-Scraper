    "postText": "**Edit/update a couple of months later for those that stumble on this post: Since making this post I have completely cut out my pudding treats at night, and most sugar alcohols, because they were causing cravings. I've also started to add vegetables into my diet via sauteed spinach, drenched in butter and salt. It's delicious and I love eating it. I also started taking multivitamins.**\n\nFirst, [the photos](https://imgur.com/gallery/1n4cfhS), because that's what we all care about the most! (There are 3 images in the gallery.)\n\nSo, I was *not* expecting to reach this milestone this morning! I was still a couple of pounds away when I weighed in 2 days ago, so I figured I still had another couple of days to go. Coincidentally today is my 8 month keto anniversary! \n\nI started at 375 on Feb 26, and this morning the scale read 274!\n\n**My story**\n\nI have struggled with my weight for around 2 decades at this point. I've tried so many different ways to lose weight, but ultimately I had difficulty sticking to anything I tried. Much of this has to do with my ADHD -- I get excited about new things and can stick to them for short periods of time, but as soon as the newness wears off, or I get bored, I'm back to my old habits. \n\nThe only time I had success was in 2003 when I started Atkins. It seemed to really work with my body and the weight melted off. I lost 52 lbs that go around. I eventually fell out of doing Atkins because I allowed myself to fall into the low carb product craze. I would eat a ton of low carb ice cream or candy and the cravings for sweet things would come rushing back. Eventually I found myself saying, \"I can have a little bit of real ice cream\" and then would finish off the tub. \n\nOver the next 14 years my weight [continued to climb](https://i.imgur.com/q2XzJLH.png). I had mild success, but would always gain the weight back, and then it would keep going up. \n\nEventually I hit a point emotionally and mentally that I was done being fat. I mean, I had hit this point many times, but it was different this time. I didn't want to die prematurely and leave my two young kids without a father. I was tired of waking up with my back in pain. I was tired of being unattractive (I had also gotten divorced about a year and a half before starting keto).\n\nSo, I started keto, and that was the day my life changed forever. \n\nFor some reason I was able to stick to it this time. It was easy. I love the food I eat, and I no longer crave sugar and carbs. I can turn down cookies and ice cream and candy with ease. For me, Keto was the answer. \n\n**How did I do it?**\n\nConsistency, mostly. \n\n*Carbs* - I eat 20 grams of net carbs or less most days. The days I go over it is never more than 60 net grams, and I always get back on track the next day. \n    \n*Tracking* - I track every single thing I eat. And I do it immediately after eating it, otherwise I'll forget about it and forget to track it. I've tracked 227 days in a row at this point. (Early on there were 4 days in a row where I didn't track right away, and eventually forgot what I had eaten those days, which is why my streak isn't a long as I've been doing keto.)\n    \n*Water* - I drink a ton of water, and I use Mio water enhancers to make it palatable. This helps keep me full when I'm in between meals. And keeps my hydrated. \n    \n*Gum* - I chew a ton of sugar free gum. This helps when I'm craving something to chew on but am not hungry. \n    \n*Simplicity* - I eat pretty much the exact same meals every single day. This makes it easy for me. Yeah, I could use more variety, but I enjoy what I eat, so it's not so bad. And I do add some variety on occasion, when I can afford a steak or when I have the time and motivation to make something more complicated. \n    \n*Cravings* - I try to stay away from sweet things. I still indulge in sweet treats like sugar free Jello, as well as sugar free pudding, but if I eat these too often the cravings come on strong, and I go overboard -- especially on the pudding, since it has carbs. Now, I try to stay away from the pudding, because I know it's hard for me to eat just one. \n    \n*Calories* - I keep my calories within a reasonable range. I know this one is a tad controversial here, since the idea is that with keto and high fat you naturally don't eat as much, so you shouldn't need to track your calories. That's how I did it for the first half, but I decided I wanted to speed up the process a little, and started keeping my calories below 2000 per day, on average over a week. Eventually I started lowering this number, and now I'm pretty consistently below 1800 per day on average. \n\n*Fat* - I try to eat at least 60% of my calories in fat. This keeps me more full throughout the day.\n    \n**What do I eat?**\n\nI've found that sticking to the same meals every day is the easiest way for me to be successful. This is what a typical day looks like for me.\n\n*Breakfast:*\n- 8 strips of bacon\n- 1 premiere chocolate protein shake\n- mixed with 1 cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk\n\n*Lunch:*\n- 1 quarter lb hamburger patty from Costco\n- seasoned with Lawry's seasoning salt\n- with 1 teaspoon of A1 steak sauce\n\n*Dinner:*\n- 1.5 quarter lb hamburger patties from Costco\n- seasoned with Lawry's seasoning salt\n- with 1 teaspoon of A1 steak sauce\n- 2 cups unsweetened vanilla almond milk\n\n*Snacks:*\n- 2 polly-o string cheese\n- 2 cups sugar free jello\n- 2 cups unsweetened vanilla almond milk\n\nI hope this was helpful for those of you just starting out, or those of you finding yourself in need of some extra motivation!\n\n**And as always, KCKO**",

Below I have some suggestions, feel free to do with them as you wish.\n\n&gt;\"but I never crave them\"\n\nThat is no problem right? Because determining your diet based on cravings or non-cravings is exactly what keto teaches you *not* to do. \n\nFunny thing is, what you crave is very malleable. When I learned how to prepare vegetables and explored how much better I feel by eating them daily, I started craving at least 0,5 lb veggies each day.\n\nI hear you say, at multiple times, that you \"really need to add veggies in\" and that \"you know\" you should. But that's not the way to go about this. Don't beat yourself over the head for not eating veggies. That never works. Eating healthy is not a duty or obligation which you have to obey blindly.\n\nAt some point you will see that *if* you want to live healthy (in all the ways that implies) *then* you have to eat healthy greens. Likely you are already aware of that to some degree, but then your stumbling block is elsewhere. Perhaps you need to learn that *if* you want to eat vegetables, you need to know how to buy, prepare and incorporate them. That causal knowledge will become dominant in your awareness and influence your choices and soon you'll be on your first step: wanting to *learn* how to incorporate vegetables.\n\nRealize that you are already eating way healthier than before. Then realize that  your choice to do so is likely based on your knowledge that *if* you eat a ketogenic diet, you feel and look Y. And we all love Y.\n\nLet that knowledge be your guidance to motivation and discipline and you'll be both happy *and* healthy.",

If there is Whey protein in them - you would be better off finding sausage or something else. Whey spikes insulin as much as glucose, or slightly more even.\n\n... you don't seem to be eating much in the way of vegetables, and if you're just sticking with meats, I don't see anything more nutrient dense like liver or other organ meats. Veggies help fill you up and are full of micronutrients. \n\n&gt; Calories - I keep my calories within a reasonable range. I know this one is a tad controversial here, since the idea is that with keto and high fat you naturally don't eat as much, so you shouldn't need to track your calories. That's how I did it for the first half, but I decided I wanted to speed up the process a little, and started keeping my calories below 2000 per day, on average over a week. Eventually I started lowering this number, and now I'm pretty consistently below 1800 per day on average.\n\nI hope you keep making progress. My concern is that with such low calories you might be slowing your metabolism down. Good luck in any event and congratulations on your progress so far",

If there is Whey protein in them - you would be better off finding sausage or something else. Whey spikes insulin as much as glucose, or slightly more even.\n\nI've read that the science doesn't support the idea that insulin spikes with whey or sugar alcohols. And my progress shows that even if it does it's not slowing me down, so I'm not worried about it. Besides, the point of the shakes for me is just as a bit of liquid filler with something that tastes good. It's quick and easy to drink in the morning while I wait for my bacon to cook. \n\n&gt;... you don't seem to be eating much in the way of vegetables, and if you're just sticking with meats, I don't see anything more nutrient dense like liver or other organ meats.

I'm trying, though. \n\n&gt;My concern is that with such low calories you might be slowing your metabolism down.\n\nAfter 8 months of consistent weight loss with no slow down I don't think this is an issue.

I\u2019m guessing the jello has a sweetener, as well as the pudding you mentioned. Sweeteners often trigger the same response as sugar and keep us connected to the sugar dragon. People who do Paleo/ Whole30 often say their cravings for desserts/ sweet stuff goes away. ",

I stayed away from any sweet thing for the first couple of months, and didn't really have cravings for sweet things like I used to, but it was still there a little bit. I found that the sugar free Jello was great at curbing those cravings. Since it's zero carbs and only 40 calories for an entire box of mix, it fit easily into my menu.\n\nThe pudding was great at first, I was eating only one a day, and it was hitting my sweet cravings without issue. I wasn't craving anything sweet throughout the day, but I was always looking forward to my pudding at the end of the night. But then I would eat two instead of one, which was 11 carbs instead of five and a half. And it would often put me over my carbs for the day.",

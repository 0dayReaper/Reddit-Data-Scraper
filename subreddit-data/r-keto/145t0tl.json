Any slight work and it hurts. I do have acid reflux, low vitamin D and it\u2019s winter, but even before keto I had all those but was never in pain. My diet is , EGGS , BEEF , FISH, AVOCADO , NUTS , GHEE, BUTTER, OLIVE OIL. Daily. Around 2 litres of water, loads of salt and potassium and magnesium. Am I doing something wrong or is my body adapting ?\n\nP.S I know keto is good for joints. Im assuming I need to up my daily vitamin D , I take about 5000 iud.",

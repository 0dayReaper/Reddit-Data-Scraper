Use fats for satiety. Learn about electrolytes.  Don't worry about a calorie deficit. You should still start to lose some water weight.\n\nWeek 2 - Review last weeks data and look for insights - Start eating to macro goals\n\nWeek 3 - Review last weeks data and look for insights - Calculate BMR and start eating to calorie deficit\n\nWeek 4 - Start growing your recipe book and pantry staples - you must be getting bored of the same foods\n\nWeek 5 - Add exercise and track it- even adding a 10 minute 3x walk is helpful.\n\nWeek 6 - You've lost weight by now so recalculate your calorie and macro goals.\n\nYou got this!",

I figured if I allow myself sin foods that are keto friendly, I\u2019d miss my carb cravings less. \n\nI was preparing for the worst: brain fog and keto flu so I wanted to have my tasty foods to keep me going. \n\nI didn\u2019t end up getting keto flu because I found a good electrolyte mix. I have a busy job and two kids under 2, so I had to prioritize convenience. \n\nI kept things pretty simple until I was fully fat-adapted. I lost weight pretty steadily as my brain was getting used to satiety from fat versus eating until full, resulting in natural caloric deficit without feeling hungry. \n\nI\u2019m 7 months in now, within striking distance of goal weight, and now focusing on fitness and transitioning to OMAD. \n\nKeto is glorious, but requires discipline. This isn\u2019t a fad diet (in the sea of fad diets).",

            "comment": "Good luck, and I hope things go well for you.\n\nMy recommendation: try and avoid processed foods, even ones labeled \"keto\", especially to start out with. Find some decent meals you like with meats, eggs, and veggies, and stick with those, and get some keto-friendly snacks to start out with (i.e. I used beef jerky from a local meat shop that makes it with no sugar, along with mozarella sticks and cottage cheese). Most people won't need snacks once they've been on keto for a couple weeks, but until the hunger starts to subside, use those snacks if you need to eat between meals.  You can potentially add in keto bread/low carb tortillas and such like that once you're used to the diet, but different people react to the carb substitutes used in those things differently, so it's good to get your body keto-adapted, and then see what you can add in later.\n\nI actually find it pretty easy to eat great keto meals by just cutting grains/bread products out of things I enjoy. I can do stir fry's, and just stick to broccoli, cauliflower, beans, bok choy, asparagus, or other green veggies, and then have it with no rice (use riced cauliflower if you really want to replace the rice, but I found I'm good with just the chicken and veggies cooked together). I make some lebanese-style marinaded chicken with toum (garlic sauce), or just go for grilled steaks, pork chops, roasts, ribs, etc, and then sautee or grill up some veggies on the side.  I love making keto-friendly chili (no beans, and use more meat and diced peppers, with less tomato), and you can always do taco salad instead of tacos. Try not to get into a rut by only eating a couple types of food- there's still a lot of options open to you on Keto.  If you need recipe ideas, there's lots of places to look, including a bunch of threads on this sub.\n\n Also remember, you don't need to fill up your diet with fat- make sure you hit your protein macro, and get enough electrolytes (eating lots of spinach helps if you're not wanting supplements, and don't be afraid to generously salt your meals if you're cutting out processed foods- you'll be losing tons of sodium if you're not eating prepared/canned/boxed foods). Eat enough fat so that you're not hungry, but don't feel like you need to eat more fat to meet your macros, rather than just keeping yourself satiated- the more you eat, the less you burn from your body.",

I keep reading that guys are to try to restrict intake to 1800-2200 a day.  That's tough because I like to graze all day.   I don't miss the grains, breads and pasta but man I miss all the fruits and starchy plants.",

Look at your protein to fat ratio on labels and of course Carbs in each unit of food. It will be a rough go to start as you eliminate excess sugar, salt,  and other cravings.

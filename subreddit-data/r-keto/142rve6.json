    "postText": "Hello!  I'm not strictly keto but working my way toward it.  However, I have kids that are in travel sports so I'm always on the go.  Looking for some low carb/keto meals that I can take with me.  Essentially, I'm usually at the ballpark or driving between locations so something that I can stick in the cooler for night games and tournaments.  The only thing I'm coming up with right now are turkey standwiches on keto bread/tortillas and salads with protein but that's going to get old really fast.  Appreciate the help!",

Chop it up and add it to a quesadilla made with low carb tortillas.\n- roasted cauliflower and broccoli, put it in some Tupperware and you can eat it with your fingers or fork.\n- \u201cpizza wrap\u201d - basically a low carb tortilla, sugar free BBQ sauce and pizza toppings all rolled up like a burrito\n- canned tuna or foil packets, I take these with me when I go backpacking a lot but requires a fork.  Sardines as well are food to mix things up.",

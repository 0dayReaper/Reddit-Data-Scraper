    "postText": "I was looking around on Amazon Prime for something to watch, and found this movie from 1997 with actress Meryl Streep.\n\nIts excellent! Its about a mom whose son developed grand mal epilepsy and they almost lose their home due to the massive med and drug bills even though none of it helped.\n\nFinally out of desperation she researches and learns of the ketogenic diet.  She takes her son to Johns Hopkins and the keto diet cures his epilepsy.\n\nI researched and found this film is based on a true story!\n\nI have been keto-ish since 2017 when my sleep apnea was treated with CPAP, and my own brain \"told\" me to eat this way. My sleep dr said he expected that to happen, bc sleep apnea disorders the appetite hormones ghrelin and leptin giving ppl abnormalcravings for sugar/carbs.\n\nThe keto dr in the film said they routinely fast patients for 24-48 hrs before starting keto bc \"fasting rests the body\". \n\nI remember that after 1 night on CPAP, the usually ravenous appetite I would wake up with was gone. I actually didn't eat anything till the next day, and all I wanted was eggs and beef, 2 foods I didn't eat bc I was a vegan.\n\nBut I think my brain, now that it was getting the oxygen it needed, knew what to make me do: fast for a day to rest, then start natural, nutrient-dense whole full fat foods.\n\nBack in 1985 an epileptic  co-worker at the animal shelter where we worked noticed I had staring spells that lasted a minute or so. She urged me to see a neurologist bc she thought I had absence (petit mal) seizures.\n\nI went and got an EEG. Turned out she was right. Dr was going to write me an Rx for a drug but I asked him if there was a natural remedy. He said, \"A high fat diet\". I recoiled in horror bc this was during the lowfat era, my mom raised me lowfat, plus I was still a vegetarian then. \n\nI never learned to drive bc you need to be seizure free for a time first. How different my life would've been if I'd listened to that neurologist!",

However, if your body isn\u2019t producing enough dopamine to begin with because of low protein intake it is as one is shooting blanks which can lead to depression and lethargy.\n\nSigned, \n\nAn ADHDer whose Hyperfocus for the past two years had lead me to read over 200 scientific papers on ADHD, and has been on Keto diet in that time.",

They may not grow as tall as they would if eating a diet with more carbohydrate in it. This was noted in this study in children using ketogenic diets. The children\u2019s progress for linear growth (that is, height or stature) slowed down after 15 months on the diet.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.nutritioncare.net/are-ketogenic-diets-good-for-kids/\n\nhttps://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-kids-shouldnt-go-on-the-keto-diet-for-weight-loss/",

Nice to see that 90% of the problems these people went through are still completely standard in America today. \n\nObfuscation or downright censorship of diets/fasting techniques in favor of drugs that have lots of side effects and only minimal affects on the actual symptoms. \n\nAnd what do we get for all this? foreclosure on our homes and threats about institutions taking custody of children when parents have the absolute audacity to question their vaunted 'treatments' and opinions. Fuck I hate this place. \n\nIts not about, and never will be about what works. It will always be about the money. Question everything, especially your doctors.",

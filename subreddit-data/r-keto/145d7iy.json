    "postText": "I've been eating Go Raw Sprouted Organic  Pumpkin Seeds for a while now and was becoming a little bored with them even though I like them. I just tried Asiago &amp; Pepper Jack Whisps about 2 months ago and found them a tiny bit too spicy for me to enjoy by themselves. Decided to crumble up the Whisps and mix them with the seeds and they're so good together! I might try adding some chopped nuts on a day I need more fat.\n\nAnyone wanna share some of the things you mix together that you love?",

Definitely not spicy, not too salty in my opinion, and super delicious.\n\nOne of my go-to's for mixing together is deli meat, cream cheese, and a pickle spear. Smear some cream cheese on your choice of deli meat and then roll a pickle spear inside of it.",

But I did recently buy a bag of the 4505 Chile Lim\u00f3n  at Costco and didn't enjoy them, though I could at least force myself to eat them so they didn't get wasted. I just can't get over the very strong pork flavor (even despite the fairly intense seasoning - which I did like) and the texture when eating them. It might be a psychological knowing what it is sort of thing since I'm also a person who can't handle chewing on fatty meats and cannot eat meat still on the bone.\n\nEdit: I'll look for that other brand to try, but pork rinds may just never be my thing!

I have avoided a lot of nuts because they have higher carbs (the pistachios and cashews specifically since they're actually my favorite), but also because my 4 year old is allergic to tree nuts and macadamia. The blood tests showed that cashews and pistachios were the worst (apparently not a surprise they were close since they're related) and my cashew milk was what sent him to the hospital in the first place. I do eat walnuts and pecans since he's barely above the allergic threshold for those 2 (they're also related apparently). I'm definitely looking forward to eating more in the future if he does well on some food challenges. But right now he's so into everything that I'm a little bit paranoid and have to keep what I do have hidden away, so I'm definitely missing most of the ones I love!",

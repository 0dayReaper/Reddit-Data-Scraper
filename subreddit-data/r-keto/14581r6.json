    "postText": "I'm working toward lowering carbs to the point I can enter ketosis. Part of that is substituting 1/2 avocado for a banana in a shake. I'm finding that frozen avocado doesn't blend as easily in my Nutribullet as frozen banana, and I'm left with the occasional avocado chunk in the shake. I generally try to minimize liquid I add to the shake to keep it as creamy as possible, and I'm sure if I water it down more, then it would be more fully blended. And I prefer the shake as cold as possible, which is why I freeze some of the ingredients (Nutribullet doesn't handle ice well, so I don't add ice).\n\nAny suggestions apart from adding more liquid?",

Frozen avocado definitely doesn't blend very easily, so I'll have to see how it goes once I phase out the banana and move to 1/2 frozen avocado.",

You may have to experiment with the time, depending on the amount of avocado, and how strong your microwave is.

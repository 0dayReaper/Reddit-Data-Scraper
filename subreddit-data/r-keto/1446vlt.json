    "postText": "I follow both r/keto and r/zerocarb and what stands out to me is that posts complaining about low energy have different responses based on the sub\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe majority of responses in the keto sub are to increase electrolyte intake, while over at r/zerocarb they suggest eating more fat\n\nAny idea why that's the case? Have you tried either/both? Which one seems to actually help you?\n\nI personally tend to do better by just adding more fat (olive oil, tallow), adding heaps of salt just doesn't sit right with me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 27M 5'11, 180lbs and \\~10% BF, so my goal is a little different than most here, actually trying to gain weight, which is why I think the increase in fat intake might be helping me",

            "comment": "When many people start keto,  especially for weight loss, and they are coming from a past history of a more typical low fat strategy for weight loss, they often aren't aware of the increased need for electrolytes/salt especially during the transition, have an ingrained bias against eating fat, and start restricting calories before they become fully fat adapted. \n\nSo it is probably both.",

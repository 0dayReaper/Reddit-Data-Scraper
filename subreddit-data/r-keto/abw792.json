Keto Bowl includes braised and hand-shredded Carnitas, Red Salsa, pasture-raised shredded Cheese, and Hand-Mashed Guac on a bed of fresh chopped Romaine Lettuce.\n\nYeah, this was an existing option to do custom; but this is great internal precedent to not have to fuss with employees there, just one phrase and you\u2019ve got an order. \n\nAlso pressures other fast casual chains to do the same.

The serving spoons make it really difficult to get an exact half portion even if that's what you're trying to do, and they don't want to get accused of ripping the customer off. So they'll pretty much always err on the side of too much. It is consistently more food for your buck every single time. ",

It's legit over a pound of food even with double meat, depending on if you get all the good stuff or not.\n\nMine is typically romaine, meat, salsa(s), sour cream, cheese, and guac. No dressing, of course, and it isn't needed with these toppings. In fact, I just had one a few hours ago. I'll be full until bedtime. It was $14, which is kinda steep. I figure, that is only a daily charge since I only eat once a day. It's decent when I haven't had time to meal prep.",

But to me, being keto friendly would mean they would give you the guac free in exchange for removing the rice and beans.  Maybe the numbers don't work out exactly, but at least a discount would be nice.\n\nAlso, I don't really understand why they automatically include red salsa for 3 net carbs.  You can get fresh tomato salsa for the same.  But to be honest, since the queso is only for half a carb more (!!), I'd take that sacrifice.  Yes, additional calories, but the extra fat would probably keep me satisfied longer.",

I'll give it a try next time I'm out of town though, it sounds like a better deal.",

With easy on the sour cream and easy on the tomatillo/medium salsa, you're looking at around 12g of net carbs. If you get a full blast of each it's more like 15g.\n\nThe fajita veggies are 4g net carbs and the pico de gallo is 3.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNutrition calculator here:[https://www.chipotle.com/nutrition-calculator](https://www.chipotle.com/nutrition-calculator)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I run on a 25-30g a day carb allotment because I'm a big guy with a lot of weight to lose, so if I eat 2 meals a day the way I usually order my bowl that equals about half my carbs, so I don't worry about it. If you're trying to eat on 20g of carbs a day naturally this is kind of a heavy hitter. It becomes more reasonable if you ditch the fajita veggies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCalories though, that's a lot of bulk for not a lot of calories. Without cheese my bowl runs around 300 calories which isn't much. With cheese and full sour cream it's closer to 450. ",

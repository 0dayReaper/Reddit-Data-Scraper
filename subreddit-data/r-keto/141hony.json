My calorie intake is around 1850, with an intake of fats around 120g - 150g. Proteins is around 70g. Any suggestions you think I should make or  change.",

You really don't need to meet or exceed your fat goal especially while you're currently trying to lose weight as your body will naturally take fat from your system when it needs it. I would try to keep your fat at around 50 g per day",

I normally do a 16/8 routine so I eat during an 8-hour period and drink nothing but water during the rest of the 16 hours. This is also a good method to help kick you out of a stall.",

Most people fail ... so good job at succeeding so far.\n\n**Some thoughts:**\n\n*1850 calories is a bit low.*\n\n**My personal experience:** when I stall on weight-loss. eat at maintenance (current bodyweight x15) for 7 days, and then go back to the \"caloric deficit\".  ANything above 90 days of caloric deficit, and your body's hormone's adapt and it's difficult to continue weight-loss. I know it's difficult, but \"stuff\" your body with 2700 calories/day and then go back to 2000 calories/day.\n\n**Make sure your keto macros are set properly, and you're tracking everything with MyFitnessPal.**\n\n**Also make sure you start your day wth MCT oil/Black coffee before your first meal.**\n\n*MCT oil ensure that you metabolize fats for fuel for the next 24 hours.*\n\nDM me if you have questions. I lost 70 pounds on keto and have kept it off.\n\nGoodluck and congrats!",

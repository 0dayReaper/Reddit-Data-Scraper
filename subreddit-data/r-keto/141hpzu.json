    "postText": "I love Keto, how it makes me feel physically and mentally, it is truly a wonderful lifestyle.\n\nI don't have carb cravings or sweet cravings like a lot of people.\n\nMy biggest issue is how much effort it can be to make each and every meal from scratch, I think I devote nearly 2 hours a day to simply cooking and cleaning dishes \ud83d\ude05 It makes me want an easy way out sometimes.\n\nAny tips for cost effective lazy keto ideas?",

My meals are almost exclusively a protein and a non-starchy  vegetable or small salad, neither of which takes me even a half hour to prep, cook, and clean up.  On those instances when I make something more involved, I make enough that portions can be frozen and reheated at a later date resulting in zero prep/cooking and no cleaning beyond my plate and tableware.",

For meat, I do like 8-12 pork chops or chicken breasts at a time either in the oven or on the bbq. For veg, I buy frozen broccoli and green beans (they're already cut), so all I have to do is nuke em or throw em in a pot and bring it up to just a boil. \n\nI've been making keto snacks, too... but it takes me less than an hour a week to do them up.",

Then you sear it when done cooking.\n\nOnly downside is it can take a while. Steaks take 2-3 hours but roast take 24-48 hours. But there's minimal preparation and cleanup.",

So some days I\u2019ll mix taco seasoning into the already cooked beef, sprinkle on some cheese and eat with lettuce wraps. I\u2019ll mix chicken with a little bit of ranch and eat over greens. I\u2019ll mix the beef with (low carb) pasta sauce, put over palmini noodles and sprinkle with parm or mozzarella. Just some ideas :)\n\nPre sliced mushrooms saut\u00e9ed in butter with some eggs and hot sauce is a go-to breakfast as well!",

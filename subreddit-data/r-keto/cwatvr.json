    "postText": "Just a quickie here. I dropped my daughter off for kindergarten a year ago almost to the day that I would say I was at my heaviest weight (~230 lbs), and I did the same thing yesterday for 1st grade. The difference is pretty crazy!\n\nI'm at maintenance now and also doing a body recomposition with 5X5 strong lifts (starting week six!). I'm currently bouncing between 158 lbs and 164 lbs (with some pretty wild daily swings; still not sure the scale isn't malfunctioning, ha!).\n\nI'm trying to learn about manipulating my calorie/carb intake to assist with strength and tone gains. Still enjoying the process and still fully Keto!\n\n[Gains!](https://socceresq.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/addtext_com_mtaynjuxndm1mq.jpg)\n\nEdit: Thanks for the Gold!",

Also Kero worked well for me on a cut, but now I\u2019m looking to make gains I am back on the carbs, just try to keep them coming from better sources (so no candy etc) might be worth considering if you get more serious about lifting.",

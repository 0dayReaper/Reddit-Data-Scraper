I have the same symptom - runny nose, no congestion, triggers are exercise, eating, the outside air. There are treatments available, mostly in the form of nasal sprays. I suggest seeing a doctor to exclude other causes like allergies and, depending on where you live, the treatment requires a prescription.",

You can google \"vasomotor rhinitis hereditary\" and find articles from reputable medical reference sites and children's hospitals. My father and one of my brothers had it (runny nose after eating or defecating) and so do I. All 3 of us plus my sister have seasonal nasal allergies to pollen and freshly-mown grass in the summer and ragweed in the fall. OP: do allergies run in your family?\n\nAlso I've noticed that my sense of smell seems to be more intense since I've been on keto. If that's happened to you, then you may be more sensitized to smells you never noticed pre-keto and that could cause your reactions.",

The dairy produces extra phlegm. It does happen to some people.",

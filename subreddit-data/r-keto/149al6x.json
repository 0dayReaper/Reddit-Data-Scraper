            "comment": "You can eat more fat.  Since your goal is to repair your insulin resistance,  you don't want to bulk up on higher carb fats (nuts and nut butters specifically) that might add calories but undo your good metabolic work, and dairy fat might be a good source of low carb high fat foods that you can increase.  And if you were doing OMAD, maybe switch to eating twice a day.",

            "comment": "Theres only 3 ways to gain weight.  Either (1) gain muscle, (2) gain fat, and (3) body holding more water.  Since you are keto / carnivore, (3) is definitely most unlikely as there\u2019s no carbs, meaning it has to be either (1) or (2).\n\nIt is unlikely for you to (2) since your hunger will stop you from overeating, thus leaving you with only option (1). \n\nThe body can only gain muscle by having micro tears in the muscle fibres.  Body will then heal the tears by drawing nutrients you consume and patching those tears up with more muscle fibres than before.  That is how you gain weight/mass.\n\nWhile on a keto / carnivore diet, your hunger signal will guide you in consuming the correct amount of nutrients based on what the body needs.  Meaning your body will naturally find its most optimal shape given your level of physical activities.\n\nTherefore my guess is, you don\u2019t do much resistance training?  Bulking on carnivore requires lots of force feeding and is a daily challenge.  It\u2019s worth it tho :)",

It\u2019s all about eating more when needed and you need to eat more. Also you need to lift because eating more will likely come on the body as fat. Probably don\u2019t need that. \n\nIf you can\u2019t eat more look for ways to drink calories.",

If that's not enough, add some cheese or anything else that's low carb and high in calories.\n\nI eat a lot of calories, and Keto is absolutely glorious because so many Keto foods are both high in calories and nutrient dense.",

Not nearly as much as I thought I would have after seeing pictures of people with similar weight loss. \nIntermittent fasting helped with that a lot, I think. It also helped that I'm still relatively young. I've recently started taking collagen peptides daily as well and seeing if that will make any difference. \nBased on the research I've done, it can take up to a year after significant weightloss before your skin stops tightening. \nSo as of right now, I'm okay with it.\nIn a year or so, I'll evaluate and decide where to go from there.\n",

Prior to that had the mindset that life worked around me.At that time I wasn't sure if I HAD time, I was slated to go to a care center to learn how to walk again after a severe back issue. Avoided that, and left on a walker with an oxygen machine,A year of diet later, I had slimmed down a chunk and got a spinal stimulator implanted which helped with pain - was able to get into the gym in January of this year - it's become a daily.\n\nAfter a body scan a couple weeks ago, I realized that I hit goal. Loss of 215 lbs, and a body fat of 13%.  Intermittant fasting, Keto, and being stubborn absolutely saved my life.\n\n\\#ThanksKeto\n\nEDIT- WHOA!  Thanks for the Gold, Platinum, Silver - and amazingly kind words.",

I'll keep sharing - it was a post like this that led me to a macro calculator that made things black and white - hopefully it rolls forward and ignites a stranger's path.  \n\nEdit - I think all the calculators follow the same logic - find one and stick with it, the one that I started with is no longer.",

But when he had a stroke, it changed everything. While even then he was strong willed and fighting to get the ability to walk back and lose weight, his fucking cancer came back and it was too late for doctors to do anything. \n\nBeing overweight is a disease if you ask me and my who family has had an issue with it always, it\u2019s hereditary for some families to gain weight easily.\n\nEdit: On his death bed, since he had a hard time talking, he had to use a laptop and write us. He wrote something like this: \u201cMy children, lose weight as it will kill you\u201d.",

I also have hypothyroidism and it's not uncommon for us women to lose weight more slowly to begin with. Plus, my weight seems to be distributed differently, I'm fitting into smaller sizes than I used to at this weight... in such a different way that it doesn't actually make sense lol.\n\nAnyway, this is inspiring even for those of us that have no problem staying keto for the rest of our lives.

For me personally it was easier to go gung ho in college with minimal responsibilities but it seems to be much harder getting uber strict and consistent while also maintaining daily life activities.",

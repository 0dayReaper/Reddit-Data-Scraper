            "comment": "\u201cWelcome to r/keto! It sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms associated with the so-called \"Keto Flu.\" Please be advised that Keto Flu can happen at any time but the good news is that it can be avoided with proper electrolyte management.\n\n\nAre you getting 5000mg sodium, 1000-3000mg potassium, and 500mg bioavailable magnesium daily?\n\n\nIf the answer is \"I don't know,\" start tracking that intake and supplementing. Electrolyte needs are different for everyone, but these are good guidelines to follow. More information can be found in the FAQ section [Adapting to a Low Carb Lifestyle](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#wiki_adapting_to_a_low_carb_lifestyle).\n\n\nr/keto is not a replacement for your doctor- please seek medical attention if you are concerned about anything you're experiencing.\n\n\nAs a reminder, please read our FAQ before posting.

Some are cheaper than others. Canned salmon, herring, mackeral, or kippers.Oysters, beef cheek or beef toungue are all options. Also, red flesh rainbow trout. Some kinds of tuna, especially in olive oil are good for fat. Though i personally buy my canned fish in watet because im a smaller person so need less cals in general, and so need less fat for my individual needs. That said, all things i listed are in my dietary rotation at one lount or another. \n\nAlso, a good old slab of brisket or ribs is pretty high in fat and lower on proturn ratio wise so ig u need more fat u definatly want to buy a lot of that, preferably on sale because brisket is hella expensive. A small whole uncooked brisket in my area can cost $80-90, but on sake can range from $30-70, depending on the price cut. Sometimes brisket whole price is ovef $100 in my area. Though the amount of meat lasts weeks. I have to cut in half and bake in two slabs. I usually dehydrate the second half for long tetm storage/emergency food ration myself but there u go.",

I don't count calories but only try to eat when hungry and stop eating when full. I also was not really losing weight during that months long period of exhaustion, but finally started to around the time I started feeling a bit less tired....I started 20 lbs from my goal weight and am down almost 10 lbs in the last 6 weeks.

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019ve read the FAQ on electrolytes but I\u2019m still struggling pretty hard with what I\u2019m supposed to be doing. From my meals that I eat, my daily intake appears to be 1500mg sodium, 1400mg potassium, and only like 100mg calcium. I don\u2019t know how to calculate magnesium since it doesn\u2019t appear on any of the nutrition labels.\n\nI guess I can pretty easily add more sodium to my diet by adding salt to my meals (apparently pink Himalayan is best?). But I\u2019m struggling with how to add more potassium, calcium, and magnesium. I can\u2019t really figure out what foods to eat to get these electrolytes but not add any more carbs? Should I just drink a ton of those LMNT things?\n\nSorry if this has been asked a lot, I just have read a lot of information and it all kinda confuses me and I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to get my electrolytes in balance :(",

I stopped supplementing potassium when I noticed I was going overboard, between my diet and then adding 2-4kmg on top of that, I was seriously close to overdoing it. Like funny chest feelings. I feel now as if I get enough just from foods. If I go overboard with salt I will add a scoop of potassium powder to negate those effects and it seems to work ok. Main thing is to see what works for you. Just an FYI though you can get really hurt from taking too much potassium so I wouldn\u2019t ever go supplement above the recommended amounts here if you are also eating foods with potassium too.",

There\u2019s obviously some huge discrepancies there. Can anyone just give me a concrete answer on how much a 28-yr old female is supposed to get daily? \ud83d\ude43",

Many people get enough from food alone. If you aren't feeling the effects of a deficiency then you are probably fine.",

On average, adults need between 2,300 and 3,400 milligrams per day.' Web MD. \n\nWhy stick with 1000mg? There's plenty of the stuff in meat and fish, and those are probably a big part of your diet now. You might be getting enough/close to enough. \n\nOn a unhandy note, symptoms of high potassium are pretty much the same as low electrolytes... Except for your heart.\n\nReverselazurus will ask you the most important question, how are you tracking?",

Hyperkalemia (high potassium) can cause bradycardia (slow HR). With keto you pee out a lot of electrolytes with the fat stores you\u2019re burning so it\u2019s important to keep track of them.",

Every human body has a different requirement. 1000mg should be more than sufficient, however, especially if you are including brassica vegetables in your diet (broccoli, spinach, etc.).\n\nPersonally, I find as long as I am supplementing *at all*, it's enough.",

We do OMAD, so not entirely sure if we're hitting our daily requirements or not, but we figured it wouldn't help to boost since we've both been having muscle cramps lately.",

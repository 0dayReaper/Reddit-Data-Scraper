    "postText": "I know this will be a long shot but is there anyone with narcolepsy that\u2019s found keto to be beneficial?\n\nI\u2019m so tired of being so tired and sleepy all the time. The stimulants I take to keep me awake are giving me bad side effects and I absolutely cannot afford Xyrem or xywav or wakix even with my insurance. I failed provigil and nuvigil. \n\nThought I\u2019d branch out and try keto to see if it will help me. \n\nAnyone else here with narcolepsy?",

Carbs and refined sugar are a huge trigger for my sleep attacks, especially in the mornings. It caused a lot of disordered eating for me without even realizing I was doing it. I would avoid eating until I was able to nap immediately afterwards. \n\nI would say my EDS has really improved, I do still nap some days but I\u2019m not exhausted day in and day out and I don\u2019t get those feverish moments of almost collapse anymore. My nighttime sleep is also way, way better. I would try it and see how it goes.",

    "postText": "Im an obese truck driver. So being fat and sedentary ended up giving me some pretty thicc swollen legs. I did go to the doctor when I developed the issue and made sure I don't have congestive heart failure or anything. Doc says I'm healthy, despite my leggos and extra fat. Doctor said buy compression socks. I realized that won't last forever so I'm trying to be healthier. \n\nI'm not even that far into my health journey and my legs have improved so much. They used to be a bit painful with how they swelled.  \n\nI honestly used to trash on keto.. I'd see those dumb videos that make it out to be gobbling nothing but ground beef, chaffles, and straight butter. I am a moron for thinking so narrowly for so long \ud83d\ude05 I have hardly changed anything about my diet. The only thing I struggle not to eat is sugary iced coffees and potatoes. I am a slut for potatoes so it's been a bit hard. But I'm very happy with the consistency and basic foods like lettuce wrap sandwiches, pickles, cheese, chicharones. I especially love that I can eat watermelon \ud83d\ude0b\n\nI do hope to drop some weight so my joints can rest. I used to be anorexic and numbers can be a huge trigger for me. I don't know If I've lost any weight yet but regardless if I do I am happy. I am very happy that I don't have to sit there and count out all the carbs. I can take a quick glance at the carb count and most of the time it's very low.",

For me, I found that going hard core Keto and watching my macros closely for 3-4 weeks killed my carby sugary cravings much faster than when I just reduced my carbs at first. This is just my experience FWIW. \n\nYes, I did find significant joint swelling reduction, especially in my knees. \n\nAlso, as a side note, the first rule about Keto is don't talk about Keto. If anyone asks you (and they will if you keep up with this lifestyle) what you are doing to lose weight, you have simply \"reduced your carbs and don't eat sugar\". DO NOT tell them you are doing Keto. Most continue to be where you used to be regarding Keto and it will open floodgates of them criticizing your food choices and decision to go Keto. Spare yourself lots of grief. Trust me--zip your lips about Keto. :)",

I don't believe in diets, it's not going to work\"- friend\n\n\"You're going to faint on that diet! You know we are in peak season!\" - my manager\n\n\"Keto is not sustainable. You are going to be malnourished!.\" -doctor\n\n\"You should be eating low carb and vegetables. But, not keto!\" - nutritionist.\n\n...\n\nThe reason why I told my friends and colleague is because I eat with them often and want to tell them of my diet restriction. Many restaurants here sells fried rice and noodle dishes. Only certain restaurants don't bundle the high carb and meat together. \nMost of the time I go where they'd usually eat and scan for meat or ask for a dish without rice so I can eat at lots of places (but not all restaurants have that option). \nNowadays, they are really accomodating of my meat, leaves and mushroom diet haha. (Basically going to places that don't focus on fried nice or noodle shops..I do bring my own food everyday, and join them after asking where they are eating)",

Now I\u2019m on the lion diet and I\u2019ve never felt better in my life.\n\nA lot of the ailments and diseases we suffer are due to our diet.  The consumption of seed oils and highly processed carbs.  By simply removing them from your diet, they will magically go away.  \n\nKeep it up, the benefits from changing your diet is literally life changing for the best",

I will NOT diet during this week (coming home Sunday the 25). I plan to go back on Keto that Monday.\n\nNow, I know most people will say \"Just don't hop off the diet\". Look. I am. We go on vacation just once or twice a year. I'm not going to monitor anything. Granted, I know my stomach has shrunk so I don't think I'll be eating as much as I think I will. I also understand I'll probably gain some water weight back. I do plan to exercise daily (lots of walking).\n\nThat said, anything I should be concerned about? Will introducing sugars cause any extremely bad feelings or whatever ? Any advice or thoughts from someone who has done similar will be great. \n\nThank you all.",

There really should be no shakes or dizziness, not even talking about after a month of keto. First couple of days? Perhaps, but not after a month. If I were you, I'd do intermittent fasting and see how I feel after 16-20 hours without food. I am pretty sure that you'd feel much better without spiking your insulin for that long. \n\nRemember, insulin is still \"opens\" your cells for glucose while you are adapting to keto, so you need to keep your insulin as low as possible until your cells would downregulate glucose uptake.",

I ate mostly vegetables, protein, healthy fats previously but with some beans and complex carbs though less than the average person. I did eat fruit but no refined sugars or anything. I initially reduced my calories from around 3000 to 1600 based on a keto calculator but after being directed to keto gains as I used to lift and do martial arts prior to keto I increased it to 2400. I tried fasting on some days off because I wasn\u2019t able to do it on a work day and feel safe but it was too awful for me so I figured I should wait until I was better fat metabolised before putting myself through that again. I go 14 hours without food between dinner and breakfast most days and 16 on weekends anyway.",

I'm thinking that I can't help you, but I'll try. Why have you been eating so many calories before keto, though? Have you tried intermittent fasting before keto? I myself was doing it for more than a year before trying keto as cutting out almost any sugar (sucrose, fructose) from my diet, though I ate fruits from time to time. When I tried to follow low-carb diet without ketosis I felt pretty much like you, no energy to do anything,  but when I fasted for at least 16 hours my energy was reappearing. In the first weeks of trying keto I had a surge of energy feeling like never before until my very low fat storages were down or so.\n\nMay I ask you, what do you mean by healthy fats? Mostly saturated, some mono-unsaturated, and essential fatty acids in 1:1 - 1:4 omega-3 to omega-6 I hope? Also, intermittent fasting is the thing that makes you fat adapted more than anything else, and you really shouldn't feel bad doing it.\n\nEither you still have not enough electrolytes or you need to give fat adaptation more time, or both.",

I feel silly that I never knew that term. \n\nI honestly didn\u2019t realise 3000 calories was a lot. I never counted them until I put in my details on the keto calculator and it gave me my new macro calorie amount. Then when I couldn\u2019t get over how little food I was allowed I put in my old diet into my fitness pal and it told me that my old calories were between 2500 and 3500 depending on the day and what I had been doing. \n\nIm not sure what the fat ratios are but it was things like olive oil, coconut oil, ghee, avocado oil, walnut oil depending on the dish. I did also eat sesame oil if I was making East Asian dishes which I knew wasn\u2019t a very healthy fat but it was a treat. I have added beef suet and butter and Mct oil to my regimen now for keto so there is less space for the others and I cut out sesame oil completely. I have switched to more meat products than fish. I used to eat organ meats as a kid but haven\u2019t in years so that\u2019s on my list to try, maybe it will help if I have some mineral deficiencies. \n\nI will give it time, maybe another month because I do find the science very interesting. I will try to fast today as it\u2019s my day off and give working out a miss and maybe just go watch a movie. Maybe I have some other health condition or whatever that I don\u2019t know about that makes me a poor candidate. Or maybe because I\u2019ve never been on a diet before my body is totally freaking out.\n\nThank you so much for your advice.",

                    "comment": "&gt;shakes and dizziness from low blood sugar\n\nUsually, you'll need to measure the electrolytes to make sure you are getting enough. But you also need a pinch *more* of sodium/salt for each hour of exercise. So your base sodium is 5,000 mg; then you have more salt for exercising. Note that salt is only 40% sodium. You also need to water too.\n\nSince you were doing 2,400 calories I do not know how much potassium or magnesium you needed to add. But if your sodium is to low, you could piss out your other electrolytes because you are not absorbing well without the sodium. Calories usually don't give you trouble on keto, unless you are not having the minimum fats. It's almost always too low sodium. Many are affraid of sodium because of government guidelines: But really the guidelines are telling people the *minimum* amount of sodium  they need to live (or prevent a particular disease).\n\nYou mentioned low blood sugar? Did you measure your blood sugar? If you were in ketosis, you really are not going to get low blow sugar. And the ketones help your body a lot, so you would not feel weak unless you were below 50. Ketosis is very important, the ketones are the energy source on keto: The fat fuels the ketones. Ketones also cross the blood-brain barrier. See youtube, learn as much as possible about keto from those who are practicing keto daily.",

It\u2019s quite hard to get. Although my nutrition manager app says I have met my target but I think those values are off. I have tried adding lo-salt as it has potassium but my electrolytes mix is pretty low on the potassium and obviously I can\u2019t eat bananas and plantains any more. Do you have a good potassium recommendation?",

It is possible to piss out your potassium because you did not increase sodium enough. We were all taught to lower sodium. I don't think you need to add potassium.\n\nYou did not say how many mg you are getting of sodium from your broth. Usually it's around 800 mg. Obviously that is not much. Plus you are athletic, you need a little more than the 5,000mg of sodium for working out days. The more you learn about keto, the easier it becomes.

Maybe a low carb non-keto diet is better suited (&lt;100g carbs). For low energy, electrolytes, if you are taking them and still feel low, have some more, some people need a lot more than others.",

Yet it didn't matter how much I ate as if my GI tract wasn't working. My stomach hurt, my bowel movements were once two weeks if lucky, and I was bloated all the time. Before trying keto I tried 50-120 carbs a day with lots of vegetables and fats, it was hell, I had no energy to even walk outside. I really wonder how I stayed alive that month. Though maybe it was just poor diet choices because of food intolerances that I discovered on keto or that I was just not fat adapted enough. Perhaps trying it again wouldn't be that bad, but from my experience I can't digest fats that well, while carbs finally have fixed my stomach issues.",

I started doing keto and counting calories to help me lose this last bit of weight. But would it hurt if I ate what I want one day a week and keto/strict calorie count the rest of the week? Could I still lose? Anyone try this method?",

    "postText": "Got a routine check up and blood test this week. Last time I was in the office was early January and I weighed in at 290 pounds and my blood pressure was 156/100. The doctor told me to check back mid-year and if my blood pressure was still high I was definitely going on meds. I agreed with him on that, even with White Coat Syndrome that blood pressure was way too high. So I promised I would be in better shape the next time I came in. He just nodded while writing in my chart and said \"uh huh...\" Granted, I'm sure he has heard that a million times with no real outcome. But I was dead set on changing my ways.\n\nCut to this week's appointment. I step on the scale and it was 243 pounds. The nurse then took my blood pressure and it was 145/100 (shit). She took it a second time, but this time she had me talk about my kids. I told her some funny stories and when she finished she said \"see, much better\". The second measurement was 128/85, higher than it should be, but not terrible. The doctor came in, asked me how everything was, did a quick examination, then sat down looking at my chart and sighed. He turns to me and says \"With that blood pressure you have two options: I can put you on blood pressure meds or you can lose weight and exercise\". I had a slight smile under my facemask and asked, \"you mean like the fifty pounds I've lost since I saw you last?\" He furrowed high brow at me, then scrambled through my charts while saying \"YOU DIDN'T LOSE FIFTY POUNDS!!\". Then his eyes lit up and he said \"You son of a bitch. Wow. Good job! Let's keep you off the meds for now and see where you are in 6 months. I'm impressed.\" He didn't ask how I did it, but said to keep on doing what's working and we'll meet again in 6 months. \n\nI've still got 60 pounds to go, but I'm taking that appointment as a win.",

My doctor asked what I wS doing different and I said keto. She nodded and said she does keto as well but isn\u2019t allowed to recommend it though she wishes she could.\n\nGood job on your results!",

I never suffered any adverse reactions like keto flu but I hear it\u2019s not that bad for some. I only get dizzy when I forget to eat. My issue is with taste. I just am not a huge fan of meats and fats. Every diet is going to have its problems though. Most people can\u2019t stand vegetable diets because they have an unhealthy relationship with vegetables. Thankfully, I grew up eating straight out of a garden so that\u2019s never been a problem for me. But even as a kid I struggled with meat. Partially because I love animals. Mostly because I just don\u2019t enjoy the flavor. And until the 4 month stint with keto I used to LOVE cheese. Now I gag when I see it. I may have over done it on the cheese while desperately trying to create palatable meals. This time around I\u2019ll be mindful of moderation and find work arounds. Like.. I despise nuts, but I like nuts in recipes. I despise cauliflower rice (sorry guys.. that\u2019s just..ugh) but I love spaghetti squash. And omg zucchini noodles are amazing.. So now to find stuff to go with it that will give me the macros I need. Baby steps.",

It\u2019s a socially accepted way to fee better (until\nYou are obese and then it\u2019s not). \n\nIt\u2019s interesting to reflect on.  For example, I recently was considering buying a house that with my budget I could just afford. But would leave me no margin for error. I decided it just wasn\u2019t worth the risk which was the smart thing to do, but it still left me feeling a little depressed and frustrated (woe is me bullshit). A year ago I would have been binging shitty food to feel better. Now I just forced myself to do my daily run to de stress. Healthy habits while not always fun are surprisingly helpful.",

I used to actually starve myself from stress but as I got older it went from starving to just not caring what I put in my mouth. I never overate but when the plate of Mexican food has 1500 calories and breakfast that morning had 500 and the cheesecake you had was 400.. issues arise. It looks like normal servings until you realize the density of calories. ESPECIALLY in drinks! You get addicted to a large blended frozen chocolate from Dunkin and register \u201cliquid\u201d instead of \u201ccalories\u201d.. Then you are seriously in trouble. Because it goes right through you so you are hungry again during your next meal.. Then you find out that one drink had 1100 calories!!!! Yeah, it\u2019s ice coffee with Splenda for me now. 130 calories. That\u2019s where I went wrong. Judging by size and content and not by reality.",

A low carb diet is keto. Period. With no official scientific definition that I know of other than a diet low enough in carb to enter Ketosis and sustain it. Talk to 10 different people you will get 10 different variations of it. Dairy free, nut free, sweetener free, carnivore, adding allll the fats or just the fats that come naturally in food, high fat, moderate fat, keto gains protocol, fruit in small quantities/no fruit/berries, net carb or total carb, under 50 carbs, under 20 carbs the list goes on. People will argue what\u2019s keto and what\u2019s not all the time. The fact is that the keto diet is simply one which is low enough in carb to force the body to derive most of its energy from ketones rather than glucose. \n\nKeto for epileptic people is very very low carb. And they never called it keto back then btw. And 15 years ago nobody really used the term keto they just called it low carb. \n\nFood for thought ;-)",

I didn\u2019t put him on a low fat diet like the hospital recommended.. I put him on a keto diet. It turned out fine for him. So much so it impressed the doctor. His clots disappeared and his bp went WAY down. But because of the uncertainty it\u2019s safer to talk to professionals.. Especially if they aren\u2019t anti-keto.

I found the below online when I googled \u201cis keto bad for your liver\u201d (p.s. I was expecting kidney issues from maybe too many preserved meats and salts/ nitrates).\n\n\u201cThat's because, for people with diabetes, ketosis can trigger a dangerous condition called ketoacidosis. This occurs when the body stores up too many ketones\u2014acids produced as a byproduct of burning fat\u2014and the blood becomes too acidic, which can damage the liver, kidneys, and brain. Left untreated, it can be fatal.\u201d",

In a normal person without diabetes, dietary-caused therapeutic ketosis cannot reach the concentration of glucose to ketones required to be in ketoacidosis. That happens when a person has serious insulin issues, either an inability to produce insulin (type 1) or a decrease in insulin sensitivity (type 2).\n\nIf you have a normally working pancreas, capable of producing insulin (not type 1) then no issues, any glucose your you get from low-carb, either through dietary carbohydrates or from your liver via gluconeogenesis, your body regulates just fine with insulin. If you have decrease in insulin sensitivity (type 2) and you're in ketosis, it's because you're not ingesting enough carbohydrates to meet your bodies needs, so the liver creates it through gluconeogenesis, it won't create enough glucose to put you into ketoacidosis either.\n\nType 1 is the time when it's possible to get into ketoacidosis through dietary ketosis, but if you're type 1 you monitor blood glucose anyway and already should be aware of those risks, no matter what your diet is.",

Your blood sugar has to be above 300 which would only happen if you\u2019re eating carbs (and way more than 25 grams). It\u2019s perhaps possible that if you have a lot of stored glucose in your muscles a diabetic would have to be on top of testing their levels during induction when stores are being released.\n\nKetoacidosis is a byproduct of uncontrolled blood sugars, not eating a ketogenic diet. For a diabetic in this scenario the ketones are a saving grace, they are giving their brain energy since the patient is unable to utilize glucose. Ketones without elevated blood sugar does not constitute ketoacidosis.\n\nmy ex boyfriend had to be hospitalized because of ketoacidosis. He had type 1 diabetes and did not know. his blood sugar was above 500, a normal persons should be closer to 100. Had he been eating keto instead of pizza and beer he probably wouldn\u2019t have suffered the extreme nerve damage in his stomach and eyes that the ketoacidosis caused. he would\u2019ve had to get diagnosed at some point but i\u2019m trying to illustrate how this goes down.",

People that don't like the medical field angry that they aren't prescribing keto. Especially those claiming it's all big Pharma, which has absolutely nothing to do with it.\n\nThe biggest reason, is ketoacidosis. Sure, most people that try keto never experience ketoacidosis, but if you just ate a standard healthy diet, you wouldn't experience any health problems whatsoever. It's not that those other diets don't work, if you stick to them, never cheat, and watch those calories they will eventually work. They just take longer and for some it's actually harder to stick to, because if moderation was something people were good at, they wouldn't be obese in the first place.\n\nSo, unless it is a medical necessity, it is not allowed to be prescribed. And, keto is prescribed. It isn't allowed to be prescribed, except in cases of medical necessity, which weight loss isn't, because there are safer alternatives. It's used for epilepsy in children. Strangely enough, keto actually helps quite a lot with managing epilepsy in children. If it was \"big pharma\" they would tell the children not to eat keto and just take more pills, but they don't, because that's not what it's about.\n\nThe constant hatred towards medical professionals is exhausting. I get it, people don't trust it, but it's not all about money. Most doctors and nurses support free health care, because they don't believe it's a privilege, but a right as a tax payer. Yes, Big Pharma and insurance companies are corrupt beyond imagining. But, they don't have complete and total control over the entire medical field and all medical professionals.",

For the vast majority of people, it is totally safe and harmless. Keto was created for the intent to trick the body into thinking it was starving, because they noticed those with epilepsy who had gone without some meals, had fewer complications.\n\nIf ketoacidosis was common, then humans would have died off long, long ago, from just missing a few meals. Actually starving for a few days would be a guaranteed death sentence for any poor person, or hunter gatherer.\n\nI just wanted to clear up the reasoning for keto not being prescribed. That it wasn't a matter of malicious greed, or ignorance. It's just a matter of keeping those who might be hurt by ketoacidosis safe by not prescribing it unless it was necessary.",

My friend asks how he knew that without looking at the knee or asking for more information, to which the response was, \"Gout always comes in threes, and I've already seen two cases today!\" That's when he said he asked for a second opinion, and several minutes later a much younger guy comes in, and my friend tells him, \"This old coot just shouted that I had gout because he's already seen two people with it and it comes in threes!\" Then the new guy replied, \"Yeah that's my dad. He's retiring soon.\"\n\nWe all believed him at the time but I would not be surprised if I see this as a story joke somewhere.

I just felt like he was more going through the motions than actually helping me.\n\nMy wife suggested a new doctor and I switched and it has been night and day. My new doctor actually *sees* me and asks questions, checks on things I wouldn\u2019t think to check on, and even calls me when she does extra study on my conditions after I have left.

I have a limit of 20g of carbs a day and 1800 calories. It's not that bad really, you get used to it after the first week or two. And you'll be surprised how small an actual portion size of food needs to be of you measure and weight everything. Calories are the biggest thing, but keto helps you stay with the process. \n\nYou got this! You're streets ahead of people doing nothing, so keep that in mind.\n\nEdit: Oh! And be kind to yourself. One bad day or meal doesn't undo everything you worked towards. And you didn't gain all this weight in a week or a.month and it won't come off that quick either. Keep pushing forward!",

When he came in he said obesity was a concern and you clearly aren't obese, what happened?  Very nice feeling.  His main concern was noting you can't go back to eating the things that made you obese to begin with and expect to keep weight off.  With a combination of Keto and a lot of exercise, I feel better now than I did 20 years ago.  My blood pressure is down and we are now off the cholesterol meds for a month to get tested at my new weight to see where we go from there.\n\nI do try to avoid the saturated fats and try to get fish fats, olive oils, nuts and avocado based fats for my fat content so will be interested in the cholesterol results, knowing a lot is hereditary.\n\nKeep up the good work!",

You must (MUST) sit down quietly for 5 minutes before she measures your blood pressure. It's cool and all that she managed you calm you down by making you talk about your kids, but if you are talking, your BP will be higher than if you were silent. So you need to do some breathing exercises or something and just sit still for 5 minutes and then have her measure. You may even end up having completely normal numbers if you do this! I promise this is important. The AHA even has graphics and stuff about how important this is, so please insist on it. You should be sitting down, feet on the floor, back supported, and resting for 5 minutes before a measurement every single time.\n\nI have chronic hypertension and I'm on meds, so I take this v seriously.

            "comment": "Just got home from weekly grocery shopping, and noticed a local chain store (in the US) carries 3 varieties of frozen pureed vegetables: cauliflower, butternut squash, and spinach. it can be used as a side dish or in soup. Check your supermarkets in Australia to see if they have something similar. If you find it, that takes care of a good part of your quest.\n\nIf you have a blender or food processor, puree your own favorite vegetables, add seasonings that you like. Then heat up as is, or cook them with ground meats.\n\nGround meats.\n\nSoft cheeses (small amounts).\n\nShelf-stable meat and vegetable broths. Kettle and Fire makes both beef and chicken bone broth, and some great bone broth soups like cheddar broccoli and butter chicken. You'll probably find more varieties of this particular brand on Amazon than you will in your local stores.\n\nKeto Chow. They make mostly sweet flavors which are great for breakfast and lunch, as well as  a few savory flavors which might be good dinner soup bases for you.\n\nSeasonings are your friend! But stay away from chili pepper, cayenne or any others that may upset your stomach.",

Pop in blender and purree until smooth. \n\nMake cottage chesse bowl with berries, nits/chia seeds, protien powder , etc. Pop in blender. Do yogurt bowks this way. Thats a smoothie option\n\nAlso, keto coffee woth milk, protien powder, and coconut oil/coconit cream. Or a milk tea made that way.\n\nAnothet smoothie option, protien powder, berries, water, alvacado, whey or a bit of yogurt or u can use acv. Blend until smooth.\n\nScrambled eggs are akways a option, u can always add melted cheese on top. It requires so little chewing that ive seen people who refuse to wear dentures who have zero teeth eat without issue. \n\n\nI think this covers most bazic options",

Insteaf of simply adfing nuts, measure out hos many oz u eant and blend into a nut butter. That way u can do a applesauce bowl as another option. \n\nLasy yeat in jan i kept getting allergy realted infections. One was sinus, one respiratory. Diribg that time i had to nix my morning yogurt bowl amd did applesauce bos with nuts and cinnomon and maube a touch of cayanne pepper to clear my sinuses. U can use unsweetened canned apllesauce too, but home made cold pressed will have more nutrition. I think that with bioled egg or a carnivore patty made from egg and purred meat would be a easy little to no chew option. U can ferment apllesauce btw, or add acv for probiotics.\n\nI forgot apllesauce and applesauce bowks as a viable option. Also, any veggie feremrnts like saurkraut or kimchi u can measure and purree to eat. If u maje scrambked eggs and top with purred kimchi u get kimcji eggs in a way that u can still eat without issue.\n\ni forgot these as viable options.",

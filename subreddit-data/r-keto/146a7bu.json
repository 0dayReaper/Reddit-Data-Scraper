There was a college (don't remember which one) that did a study on avocado oil and they discovered that many were mixed with cheaper oil. Chosen was one of the few that was completely avocado oil. There were a few others that were authentic but they were sold on the east coast so I didn't bother to remember the brands. Primal products just taste bad period. I like chosen however so you might just be sensitive to the flavor. But I only use it for cooking since avocado oil is ideal for high heat cooking. I've never used it in a salad dressing. I use olive oil for that.",

Is the book where you got your mayo recipe from?",

I've been trying to fight that propensity, though.\n\nI'm not saying this is true for everyone, but, avocado oil, and anything that's made with avocado oil, like avocado mayo- it all tastes like rotten avocados to me.  I NEVER throw away food. I threw away the chosen oil and the primal kitchen mayo.\n\nI could be wrong about this, but I believe the reason why 100% olive oil mayo doesn't exist commercially is that olive oil's fatty acid profile doesn't allow for the structural component that gives mayo it's body. Hence the hollandaise you created.",

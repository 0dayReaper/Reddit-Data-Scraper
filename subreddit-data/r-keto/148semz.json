    "postText": "Hey folks, \n\nI've been doing the keto thing off and on for years, so I know how to do the standard calculations for net carbs. However, this Nick's Ice cream has a breakdown I've never seen. Could some of you smarter on this than me chime in please?\n\nIt reads:\n\"Net carbs = Total carbs - Fibers - Polyols - Allulose - Acacia Gum\n\nI get the fiber and allulose, but what are Polyols? And why would you subtract Acacia Gum from total carbs?",

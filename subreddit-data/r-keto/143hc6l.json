    "postText": "Thomas Delauer posted a good video about this a few years back and I'm still curious, does anyone know of any other zero calorie water flavorings that won't break a fast?\n\n  \nAdditionally, what are some good zero calorie water flavorings without tons of extra ingredients?  I know that there's some electrolyte powders that could do the trick but I'm not always looking for excessive sodium; I get plenty of that.  \n\n\nThanks!",

It's not like if you eat 1 calorie you're suddenly not Fasting anymore, the body doesn't work that way. In simple terms, if someone is starving and you give them one carrot, they're still starving. I don't have the right scientific terms or way of explaining it but think more generally, overall, you're still Fasting even if you ate 1 egg or something. It's not clear cut, like Fasting is eating nothing and if you eat one thing the Fasting is \"broken\". This is just the way we talk, not the way it is. There are gradients and spectrums, not either/or. It's common for people to drink as much fresh squeezed apple juice as they want (not reccomended, not ideal) and it's still a fast. So, get a drink that you will enjoy regardless of a few calories if it helps you complete your fast more comfortably.",

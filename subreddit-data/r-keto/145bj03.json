    "postText": "Hi, I recently became interested in the Keto diet, I know what I have to eat and what I don't have to eat. So my questions are oriented to the mechanism of the body.\r  \n\r  \nIn that case, to maximize weight loss should I do intermittent fasting or eat 3 meals?\r  \nIs it feasible to eat a lot and then spend it exercising? Or is it better to eat few calories?\r  \n\r  \nI am currently on fasting for the purpose of entering the ketogenic state. I have been fasting for approximately 14 hours. I'm honestly a little afraid of eating something and ruining everything.                    \r  \n\r  \nI have the willpower to avoid eating carbs, but I read somewhere that breaking the diet with more carbs than usual could maximize weight loss. Is this true?\n\nMy goal is to lose weight as fast as possible. I have been reading that you can lose up to 22 lbs in a month without starving yourself. Is the keto diet ideal for me? ",

Fasting for many is preferred because a shorter window in the day means you get to now have bigger meals, which a lot of people prefer over smaller meals spread out.\n\nAlso the \u201close as fast as possible\u201d mindset is not a very healthy one. I\u2019d personally not try and shoot for that 22lbs a month unless you\u2019re on the very very heavy end.",

Why break your fast with carbs? \n\nFasting for 14 hours *isn't* to get in to ketosis, it's to get to the cycle of autophagy. Even then, I've heard that autophagy minimum window is somewhere around the 16 hour mark. Ketosis, which is switching your fuel source from glucose to ketones, happens when your body depletes your glycogen stores and needs a fuel source and it comes off from glucose and gets ketone bodies from your fat stores. I've seen the average timeline for *this* as about 3 days.\n\n**WHAT THIS MEANS:** It means that if you're trying to get in to **ketosis**, fasting *helps* but is not the requirement for entering ketosis. That said, it means that if ketosis is your goal, you can eat during this 3 day period if you go no carb and still enter ketosis.",

Very obese people have more stored energy  (body fat) to burn.  A more realistic weight loss, after initial water weight, is 1-2 lbs. a week, and not every week (weight loss is more of a stair step down than a slide).\n\nExtreme calorie restriction can result in fast weight loss, but it comes at a price - you will lose more lean body mass than with a more moderate approach.   And you risk lowering your resting metabolic rate by several hundred calories a day, and that has the potential to be a long lasting,  possibly permanent,  change.\n\nSo, while I appreciate your urgency,  I recommend taking a longer view on achieving a healthy weight.",

It is all about kicking the carb addiction, hunger pains, heartburn etc which bring you around the wrong foods. \n\nIf you do OMAD and are not hungry during the day, then great! Otherwise the most important part is to keep the carbs low, closer to 20g per day, eat mostly protein to get your calories and use fat to settle your hunger. \n\nDoing that will ensure you have switched over to fat burning mode and will start to use your own body fat for energy instead of glucose. By keeping your insulin levels low and steady by not eating carbs, you stop the signal to store fat. \n\nJust beware, once you hit your target weight, going back to your prior way of eating will bring the weight back with a vengeance. Keto is a lifestyle for people who have not had luck losing weight with diet and exercise. If your body is more carb sensitive, the only way to lose weight and keep it off is to keep in ketosis by suppressing carb intake and insulin spikes.",

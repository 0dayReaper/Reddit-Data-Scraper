    "postText": "I have recently started working out in the mornings before work,  and have gotten into a little routine with breakfast, etc.\n\nI start my day taking a daily dose of BCAAs, about 30 minutes before going to the gym, 1 TBSP of apple cider vinegar w/ a dash of cayenne pepper and a full glass of water (16 oz), and then working out in a fasted state. \n\nAfter my workout, I'm making bulletproof coffee.\n\n1 TBSP Butter,\n2 TBSP Coconut Oil,\nHalf serving of collagen protein,\nHalf Serving of whey protein isolate,\n1 TBSP of cacao powder,\n2 Cup of Coffee,\n\nRoughly 39g of Fat, 28g of protein, and 1.5 net carbs.\n\nIs this a good routine to get into? Are there any issues I should watch for or anything I should add to this? Thanks in advance.",

I think it makes sense to eat protein within an hour of a fasted lifting session.  I try and portion my protein out in 3-4 meals per day to maximize muscle protein synthesis. \n\nBut if this routine is working for you keep it and maybe swap out the BCAAs for a protein shake.",

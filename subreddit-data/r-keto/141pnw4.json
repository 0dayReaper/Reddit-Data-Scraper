    "postText": "How long did it take before you saw an increase in energy, especially if you experienced fatigue prior to keto? What made a difference?I experience post-exertional malaise, where it could be just more than 10-15min of walking that does it - the following day, all of my muscles ache and I feel exhausted and barely functioning, even if the previous day I was doing pretty well energy-wise. I always have ups and downs. I'm only 3 days into ketovore (trying to get into ketosis and then fat adapted, and am eating mostly meat and goat diary (although had cow dairy today), along with avocado and eggs. Perhaps I should drop the avo. Also having MCT oil). Just wondering if anyone had similar experiences and what helped. I had the PEM/muscle pain and fatigue prior to keto, so it's not just keto-flu.Also curious if anyone experienced fatigue before their cycle and if keto helped. If so, how long did it take for you to feel better? I often read about benefits people experience, but always wonder about the timeline. Thanks!  \nEdit: Clarifying again that I had these health challenges prior to keto. I'm wondering if anyone saw progress with fatigue/energy (especially post-exertional fatigue and fibromyalgia) on keto and how long it took. :)",

I don't know why I feel nervous about increasing the sodium above 3,500mg so early on. I guess I wonder whether I'm already losing so much water that I need to replace electrolytes, if that makes sense? What if I'm overdoing it by going high only on day 3?   \nI don't feel worse, actually...I feel better so far, but still have pain/fatigue from walking \"too much\" yesterday. But I already feel better than before! How long did it take before you saw an improvement with PMS/fatigue? :)",

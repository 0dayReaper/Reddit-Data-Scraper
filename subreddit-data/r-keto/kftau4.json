Keto itself is fairly straight forward but I always used to fail because I am highly addicted to sweets and would find myself not being able to withstand the urge. Now I just eat 1 or 2 grapes every time I have a craving and it completely goes away. Grapes are a no no on keto but it\u2019s what helped me make it through and never knocked me out of Ketosis (I have a blood test monitor I did daily) I also failed because the second there was a weight gain on the scale, I lost all motivation in the past and just ate whatever. Now I pay no attention to it. I carry a bag of mixed nuts with me everywhere, and if I\u2019m a little hungry I just eat a few and it helps every single time.  I also look at the before picture very often and it is disgusting to me. It\u2019s all I really needed. Sorry I couldn\u2019t offer anything more.  Best of luck. Just tell yourself how badly you want to be thin more than you want to eat whatever it is you\u2019re thinking about. Sounds dumb, but it worked for me.",

Don't fret or get upset! Your body was used to a certain size and it will \"freak out\" at some point because it thinks you NEED the weight (that was lost) and will be resistant to your losing more.  Just RELAX when that happens! Eat your normal diet for a few weeks. Maybe, even have a high carb meal once or twice. This will allow your body to get comfortable at the new level. After about three weeks get serious again. Your body will have gotten confidant at the new level and won't freak out when your weight starts dropping again!\n\nThis happened to me three times!\n\nThere is a great YouTube person who explains about eating carbs occasionally to promote your keto weight loss. Guy who studied a lot of the nutritional aspects and, also, lost a lot of weight:\nhttps://youtube.com/c/ThomasDeLauerOfficial\n\nMy other two favorite youtubers:\n\nGreat for keto food recipes and inspiration:\nhttps://youtube.com/c/SeriousKeto\n\nAnd\nAn actual medical doctor who has some great info ki liked his earlier stuff more than his most recent stuff)b\nhttps://youtube.com/c/KenDBerryMD\n\nYou go! Good for you!",

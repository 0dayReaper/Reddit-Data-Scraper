    "postText": "Hi All, I am 14 days exactly in to Keto and I am counting every macro, staying under 20 carbs/ day, making sure I\u2019m getting enough sodium/ magnesium/ potassium, cut out processed foods, etc.  \nI already feel way better mentally and emotionally which is my reason for trying this way of eating, but I woke up today and I am completely exhausted/ depleted.  Like I barely got my daughter to day-camp (2 hours late) and now I am just barely propped up at my computer trying to work from home.  I want to take a half day so I can lie on the ground and stare at the ceiling.  I have no gas at all.\nI have read it takes 30 days for our body to adjust to using ketones instead of glucose, and this may be part of that transition.  Has anyone else experienced this in their first month?",

You don\u2019t need any fancy products or pills for sodium and potassium. Magnesium glycinate is very cheap on amazon to boot.\n\nThe keto flu is nothing more than electrolyte deficiency. It can happen anytime you are deficient, not just at the start. Google \u201cketoade recipes\u201d and start feeling better. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nThere\u2019s more info in the FAQ if you\u2019d like to know more:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq",

What might have happened is you accidentally knocked yourself out of ketosis, and now you're experiencing keto flu again as your body re-enters it. A lot of people need more electrolytes during that period than their standard baseline in order to shake those symptoms.\n\nOne thing I keep on hand is powdered supplements for magnesium and potassium, and of course some salt. This allows me to mix my own Gatorade using a keto friendly sweetner (I use Mio personally but not everyone is a fan). If I'm ever feeling low on energy, usually mixing up some keto juice sets me right. 75% of the time it was either electrolytes or dehydration, and the rest of the time I didn't sleep right. This mix is also clutch for IMF or longterm fasting purposes.",

    "postText": "Hi!! I am a hs senior getting ready to commit and I'm just wondering what (observant) Jewish life looks like on campus in general. Also, I know there's no Kosher kitchen but I assume there are students who keep Kosher on campus--what does this look like? Do you just have to be vegetarian? I'm so appreciative of any input. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Jewish life thrives on campus because there is a pretty high percentage of Jews on campus. Hillel (Reform/Conservative), and Chabad (Orthodox/Comservative) are your organizational outlets, always hosting events, shabbat, and high holidays. Highly recommended reaching out to them to find out the Kosher situation, you could probably DM them on IG or send them an email. From what I know both Rabbis are great and I know many kids who attend one of them regularly.",

What I do know is that for certain religious holidays where food selection is important, some dining halls will have specific food for those days to try and meet those needs. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s done for every holiday but I\u2019ve seen it a few times. Obviously that doesn\u2019t happen every day but it does happen on the \u201cbigger\u201d holidays",

Do not use the same utensils or pans to cook meat that you use to cook dairy. Not just while making a meal, and it does have to happen every day.",

Chabad rabbi was very wise but didn't accept me much because I am not Jewish by heritage. I was just following the written Torah at that time, not converted.",

    "postText": "I delivery for all the major apps. With the all the students moving in this week, I thought I put out some tips to make your food delivery a better experience for both you and the drivers.\n\nFirst, if you didn't know, IU students get GrubHub+ for free. But, if you prefer using the other apps for some reason, these tips apply to those too.\n\nIf you live in a residence hall, PLEASE put the residence hall name in the delivery instructions. We honestly want to deliver your food to you efficiently. The addresses for the dorms are not always accurate. Just today, I had:\n\n*  a customer wanted delivery to Union Street Center and the app took me to Teter. Fortunately she was willing to walk over and meet me as it was a mad house with all the people moving in.\n* a customer wanted delivery to Briscoe, but the address led me to the railroad tracks about two blocks away. I was able to call him and find out where he wanted it delivered. If he didn't answer or he left no tip, you can bet that food would be sitting on the railroad tracks.\n* a customer wanted me to deliver to Wilkie and had in the delivery instructions \"leave at door\" with no room number (not that I could have gotten into the dorm anyway). I tried calling and his phone was \"no longer in service\". He didn't answer messages. Uber Eats tried calling with no answer. If you ordered food to Wilkie today and it never arrived, the random guy outside locking up his bike enjoyed your Subway.\n\nOther notes on Delivery instructions:\n\n* We can't see the instructions until after we've picked up the food. So, please don't ask us to pick up extra Chick-fil-a sauce because I don't know that until I am almost to your place. The restaurant does not see the delivery instructions.\n* I've figured out most of the apartment complexes around, but it is always nice when the customer adds some details on how to find the apartment, especially if the numbers are not clearly visible from the street. And, when it is dark, this helps even more.\n* If you are planning to wait at the street so we can hand it directly too you, great, but please list that too. I've driven right by customers standing at a corner because I'm not looking for people, I'm looking for house numbers and safe parking places.\n\nNotes about receiving for food faster and in better condition:\n\n* Tips are our major source of income on the app. And, experienced drivers can immediately tell low tip orders. If you've tipped $1 or less, most drivers aren't touching it no matter the distance. If you live 5 miles from the restaurant, the tip should be at least $8 to get a quick pickup (barring a bad restaurant - more on that later). 2 miles from the restaurant should be at least $3. In other words, look at the distance, then tip about $2 per mile.\n* If you prefer to tip in cash, we definitely appreciate that, but put at least $3 in the app so we know it is not a no-tip order. I don't take any no-tip deliveries, nor do a lot of drivers, so your order will sit longer even though you plan to tip well. I've only been no-tipped twice and it was because of a stacked order that slipped the no-tip order in with a good tip order. I'll still deliver the food, but if I run into any delays, I'm dropping the order. And, I'm delivering the better tip order first even if I pass right in front of your house on the way to deliver.\n* Morale of the story, low tip and your order sits on the shelf at the restaurant getting cold. A new driver or a stacked order might pick it up eventually. But, I had the manager at one fast food restaurant tell me almost nightly they have two or three orders that just sit for hours and no one ever shows to pick them up and eventually it gets cancelled or thrown in the trash.\n* If you order ice cream or an ice smoothie or something will melt quickly, I recommend tipping well. I do my best to make sure the it stays cold and doesn't melt. But, if it has a nice tip (I'm not saying anything excessive, just more than $2 or $3), I'll make sure there are no delays in getting it delivered quickly.\n\nThings you might want to know about local restaurants:\n\n* If you didn't know, here are some of the ghost kitchens in the area: Super Mega Dilla=IHOP, Its Just Wings=Chilis, MrBeastBurger=Red Robin, Macaroniville and Wow Boa = Fazolis. I hear a lot of complaints about Super Mega Dilla and Macaroniville. The others I haven't heard complaints about.\n* IHOP is always slow and I think they prioritize dine in customers over delivery. At least it seems that way.\n* McAllisters is usually pretty quick unless they are extremely busy.\n* KFC often forgets items in the order. The driver can only take what they give us and can't open the bags to check. We do out best to ensure your order is right, but if the restaurant leaves something out, we rarely know it.\n* Taco Bell by college mall makes everyone go through the drive thru, so it is slow. The Taco Bell on Walnut by Bloomington South high school is much faster.\n* There are two Chick-fil-a restaurants. One on 3rd street by Target and one in College Mall. The one in College Mall usually shows lower wait times and customers often pick that. However, the driver has to find parking and walk-in and out of the mall, so it actually isn't any faster. Unless the mall isn't busy, I prefer to go to the one on 3rd because it is usually a quicker in and out and back on the road. But, if I am going for myself, I walk into the one in the Mall, because from arrival to food in mouth is quicker.\n* The navigation and parking around Dat's and India Garden right now is awful with the construction. I usually pass on those orders because I don't want to deal with all that. The restaurants are good, but your delivery may be delayed.\n* Chipotle on Kirkwood is usually faster than the Chipotle by College Mall.\n* Burger King and Five Guys don't begin preparing your order until the driver arrives. Burger King usually isn't busy, so they wait isn't bad. Five Guys the wait is usually 10 or more minutes. That costs the driver money sitting and waiting. So, I rarely take Five Guys orders now because I've dropped many because the wait was too long.\n* McDonalds by College Mall has a manager that is an absolute bitch and one that is really nice. When the bitchy one is working, food takes longer and drivers avoid her. Drivers talk and I quickly know which manager is working early in my shift so I know to avoid McDonalds orders when she's working. As a customer, you wouldn't know that, but know that it is hit or miss on the day how quickly you'll get your food.\n* Fazolis is usually good with having orders ready.\n* 3 Amigos, usually pretty good, but on occasion has issues when short staffed.\n* Chow Bar=quick.\n* Bigwoods=slow.\n* MAJE sushi=fast\n* Sukura15=usually fast\n* Asuka=usually slow\n* Crumbl Cookie =SLOW. I don't know what their deal is. They are super efficient with in-store orders, but will ignore delivery drivers for long periods of time. I usually don't even bother with Crumbl orders.\n* Dunkin=usually fast\n* Chilis=somedays fast, somedays slow depending on who is working.\n* Everyone else is fine. These are just the ones that have stood out to me as either excellent or awful.\n\nOther things to note:\n\n* Drivers don't work for the restaurant. Please don't berate us for missing items or ask us to go back to the restaurant to get it. Contacting the app support is your best bet as they will refund you for the missing items.\n* I don't give a shit about your 1 star review. I still get orders regardless.\n* 5 star reviews are nice because it helps me know if I'm doing a good job, but I don't get a bonus or anything. Sending a \"Thank You\" note in the app isn't necessary, but usually makes my day a little better.\n* Trying to get me into trouble by reporting me to the app does nothing to me. I've already reported you to the app, so I get paid regardless.\n\nHopefully, these tips help you get your food efficient and in good order. Drivers need customers, but customers also need drivers. Treat the drivers well and they will treat you well.",

The directions to where I used to live would \\*not\\* clarify which building, and there were two buildings with tons of doors to pick from, and I know if it were me I'd be hella confused, so I always tried to clarify as best I could. And while, yeah, a fair few people either missed or ignored my instructions and dropped things off at the complete other end of the complex, it usually seemed to make things go faster.\n\nBonus from me: I don't know if it's still the case, but the sweet tea from Burger King always kinda blew when I got it. I know tea is basically already leaf water, but my god could I taste the water.",

    "postText": "Our son (international, if that makes any difference) will be starting at IUB from the fall.  I'm a bit confused with regard to housing:\n\n* How are move-in dates selected or assigned?\n* I see a lot of discussion here around specific dorms but when our son signed up for housing he was only able to specify a neighbourhood.  Did we miss something?\n\nThanks.",

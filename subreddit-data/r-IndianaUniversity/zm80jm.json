More accurate but also more dull is the \u201cAccess to publicly available info sometimes takes awhile to obtain because the definition of \u201cpublicly available\u201d is frequently not clear, and it is important to not accidentally disclose someone\u2019s personal information. Hence obtaining requested records is often a slow tedious process\u201d.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had personal(non-public) information about you erroneously released then your perspective might be different. Once released it can be taken back. \n\nBut who would click on a dull story title like that?!?!",

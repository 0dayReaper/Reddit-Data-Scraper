Remember to Your bank deposit to 250 K per institution\nAs for finite math, you could use it on today\u2019s headline in the Herald Times. The story says four people had guns stolen from their unlocked cars last month.\nMy math brain says bullsh1t. \nHow many people in Bloomington could possibly have a gun in their car? Let\u2019s say one in a hundred (which I bet is high).  Now let\u2019s say one in two people leave their car unlocked. Again, a stupid number.  Let\u2019s assume there are 50,000 cars in Bloomington. So if one and 100 people have a gun in their car that\u2019s 500 cars that have a gun in them and half the people who have a gun in the car or stupid enough to leave the door unlocked that\u2019s 250. \nAnd thieves found four of those 250 unlocked cars. Yeah, right.  And the other 49,500 cars?  Did the thieves search those cars too?  If this was a random event they would have gone through (4/250) x 49500 cars.  \nDoes anyone really believe 792 unlocked cars were breached on April?  \nI don\u2019t.  \nI don\u2019t know what the explanation is, but I\u2019d bet you a whole lot of money this isn\u2019t people who are terrified enough if society they feel the need to have a gin on their car, yet stupid enough to leave said car unlocked, and then stumbles by a thief who happens to pick the right car to search. \nGet outta here.  \nWho would believe this?\nThis is why math matters. Maybe the po po can\u2019t see the odds.  Clearly the ht can\u2019t do math. A society can\u2019t function with a populace that can\u2019t understand basic numbers. \nMath is important.

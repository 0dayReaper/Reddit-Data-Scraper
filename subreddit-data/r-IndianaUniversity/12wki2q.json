Some students are fine getting AP credit for Calc 1 and starting with upper level math at IU  Others find that upper level math is a big leap, so they retake calc 1 even if they have AP credit, so they can be prepared for later math courses. \n\nEither way, if you have a 4-5 score, you at least have a choice. (And your IU math modeling is done w calc 1, so if you switch degrees, you might not even need to take math.)\n\nTalk to your orientation advisor. And schedule orientation as soon in the summer as you can, so that you can have maximum choice of schedule. Advisors can help you make decisions based on hypothetical AP scores - you don't have to have them finalized when you're at orientation.",

No matter what calc you start with, it's good to overestimate the time you'll need to study, do all homework, and go to math help. Esp at first.",

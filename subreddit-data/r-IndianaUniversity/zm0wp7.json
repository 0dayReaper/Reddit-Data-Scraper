    "postText": "So I\u2019m transferring next spring and I need to send my final transcript. I am switching my major to finance when I get to IU. The majority of my classes this semester were premed but I dropped them since they weren\u2019t related to my major. The 2 classes that I am taking (Math and Accounting) I got a B in. Do you think IU will accept my transcript?",

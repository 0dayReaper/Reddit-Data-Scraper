Really takes you out of your comfort zone and provides you with some fundamental self-preservation skills.\n\nI would definitely recommend taking the introductory course whether you are male or female, just be prepared to show up because all BJJ classes have a three absences = fail policy (with a little leeway).",

Depending on what you like, you could maybe do gender 101, there\u2019s a decent amount of reading but overall it was a pretty easy class. Intro to American Politics (or POLY-S 101) was very easy too and that professor is really chill. Ofc when I did it, it was online so it could be a bit different but it wasn\u2019t a difficult class. Or if you have a background in music (just a basic knowledge is fine), you could music in global cinema. I didn\u2019t even watch majority of the movies and I got an A in that class\ud83d\ude02, but I\u2019m also a Jacobs student.\n\nWhatever you end up going with, it might be best to stay in the 100\u2019s cause those classes are much easier (as you probably know since you\u2019ll be a senior as well).",

The likelihood of you getting a ticket depends on which lot you're parking in and at what time. Parking enforcement is done by IU Campus Police. So, if they happen to be patrolling the lot you're in before 6 and also checking parking permits closely, then they'll write a ticket. I don't know how frequently that happens. If I'm visiting campus close to the free time, I park in a designated visitor garage. If you stay in the garage into the free parking time, the arms are raised and you can drive right out.",

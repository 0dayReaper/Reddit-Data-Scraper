My application status changed from applicant to \u201cin progress\u201d and the description makes it sound like a waitlist. I applied for pre business but I am perfectly fine with just going to the regular school. My gpa for my 7th semester should be around a 3.8 so hopefully that helps my chances. Based off of what the description says it doesn\u2019t sound very good, does anyone know anything I could do to better my chances at getting in?",

They didn't reject you outright, so you don't need to reapply. You should write a letter of continued interest. Your GPA is a little low, so if you now will get a 3.8 that's great - this shows progress and maturity. Hopefully your GPA has been trending up over the years in high school - if so, mention that in your letter of continued interest.\n\nIf there is a regional IU admissions rep in your state/area, email that rep to show your continued interest. Keep up your grades for the rest of the year; if you have continued in sports, extra-curriculars, have a leadership role in any of those, or have a job, write about them in your letter of continued interest.\n\nColleges need students who fit within their range of accepted GPAs and testing scores because it affects their rankings, but they can made exceptions if you can show something extraordinary. In your letter show them why IU is a good fit for what you want to learn and show them why you're a good fit for IU, such as what you can contribute to the community and what you'd like to get involved in. Go to your school college couselor and ask him/her to write a letter of support to IU telling them why you'd be a good student for them.\n\nIf IU is your top choice you will get there. Also remember that many student leave after their first semester or first year there, so applying as a transfer student gives you much better chances of gaining admission and you will still graduate with a IU diploma. I wish you very good luck. Let us know when you get in!",

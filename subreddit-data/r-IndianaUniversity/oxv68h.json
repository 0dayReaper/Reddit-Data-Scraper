Vaccines were effective, now they aren\u2019t the silver bullet(BUT THEY STILL PROTECT AGAINST SERIOUS ILLNESS WHICH IS CRITICAL). I expect this to be case everywhere in the coming weeks if the spike continues. \n\nDisclaimer: The vaccines still protect against long covid and serious illness! These changes are mainly attributed to the fact that delta variant can infect and spread in vaccinated people. The vaccines are still very effective against serious illness. Get vaccinated! You\u2019ll thank yourself if you get a much milder case of the vid!",

Nothing like being force dropped a class and going under full time enrollment status and being forced to pay $ back to the gov/loans immediately, that you probably wouldn't have.\n\nAlso. There are a good amount of immuno compromised people at iu, faculty and students alike, let alone people with relatively common chronic illnesses like diabetes, that aren't even necessarily obese or w.e. \n\nI would wear my mask and shut up about it on campus, so that it doesn't get so bad that they shut down the bars etc again. Honestly, that would be my concern as a student (I grad in 18 so I'm not that far removed)\n\nNot that I wouldn't be pissed/tired of it either, and I am, but im also immunocomprimised now. Imagine how tired I am after being locked away essentially for almost 1.5 years now, vaccines not working for my condition, and I have to go back to work now regardless of current conditions, even though I will either die or be in a hospital for 1-3 months if I catch the RONA. Have a little compassion and keep the bars/house parties in the open where they belong.\n\nP.S.    neurological symptoms like loss of taste or smell, and \"brain fog\" are symptoms of what amounts to permanent brain damage from restricted vascular flow from the RONA. Studies are coming out now that indicate a general loss of I.Q. and critical thinking ability for even mild cases, somthing like 40-60% (or rona cases). Just fyi",

Like I love how you go with the extreme that \"OMG THEY WILL FUCKING DIE IF YOU DON'T WEAR A BIT OF CLOTH ON YOUR MOUTH REEEEE\". You know how many people have died in Indiana from Covid, on a 7 day rolling average? Like a dozen. If you have the vaccine, you are fine and almost certainly not gonna die. \n\nAnd again, you want to take precautions, go ahead. You are a responsible adult, take charge of your life. These people are at risk of everything from measles to car crash to heart attacks, we don't shut shit down. How about you factor in risk for once and stop trying to go with \"zero COVID\".\n\ni WoUlD wEaR mY mAsK aNd ShUT uP aBoUt It or what? Gonna cry? Dude, they are bound to shut down bars and games again regardless of what you do. How are you bitching at me, the vaccinated person, pointing out that with 85% of the school vaccinated, what sense does this make to force us to wear masks? Why aren't you bitching about the people who are taking this way way to far? We are young, we are healthy, let us live our lives. This is my last fucking year and I care not what some administrator thinks, they clearly don't know better than me when they think masking will somehow prevent the spread or that young people are gonna die from this. \n\nOkay cool bud. You make your own risk assessments, I don't need some administrators taking my money and pretending they need to run my life. You have one more factor of life you have to worry about, sorry, that's how it is. Stop living your life in absolute fear. You don't tremble everytime you turn the key to your car or eat a burger, do ya? Take your precautions and let everyone else live their lives, don't force us to conform. We are not gonna stop death. \n\nP.S. I am well aware of the symptoms. I have already gotten the vaccine so I don't need to worry about it. If other people are worried about the long-term effects of the vaccine on their bodies, they have every right not to take it (like you) and they should be well aware of the consequences. \n\nWhat was even the point of your fyi when the vaccines have a 70%-90% efficacy against COVID, the fact that only like .1% of the vaccinated population have gotten COVID symptoms and an even smaller number have died from it. Like dude, when essentially the entire school is vaccinated, what more can you do? \n\nAnswer: Nothing.",

The thing about herd immunity is that I believe around 90-95% of the population in an area must be vaccinated to reduce spreading a disease but we are a bit short from that. What\u2019s worse is that vaccinated people can also spread covid so no one is safe from getting sick but vaccinated people are safe from serious illness or dying.",

Seriously.....The flu strain constantly evolves and mutates, that's why they have to guess what strain is going to be in circulation. \n\nYour second one is an anecdotal. There is no widespread evidence that kids are far more seriously in danger than they were before. What you basically said with the ICUs in Alabama is no better than anti-vax moms pointing to a couple kids having averse reactions to shots. \n\nAnd the flu can still infect vaccinated people. Do we force everyone to wear masks? The vaccines were not meant to 100% guarantee you can't get it, just that you can't die from it. And masks have done nothing. Cloth masks don't prevent the spread. Germany instituted a mask mandate and then got hit with a surge. Same with Israel, same with the Netherlands. \n\nlEtS dO a LiTtLe wOrK tO pRevEnT fUrThEr MuTaTiOnS soooo basically mask until the end of time? That it? Because I did my work, I got the vaccine. Sorry we are never going to be rid of this thing and preventing new mutations is impossible. And don't pull the \"think of the children\" card, kids are not in danger from this.",

How many have died from this Delta variant? When I referred to the flu, did you notice that I wasn't referring to its deadliness? Just the methods of mutations. Maybe you need to leave school if reading comprehension is a little hard for you.\n\nWhich doctors? Fauci? LMAO He literally said masks for children were not necessary. How many times has he and these doctors flip flopped? Are kids dying from this thing? Are they the chief vectors of transmission? Answer: No. So why the fuck do they need to mask up? The CDC themselves said they didn't. Europe doesn't mask up their kids and the WHO never said they had to. Is it because they don't care about the kids?\n\n[https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-science-health-education-coronavirus-pandemic-a65c9c0375ce441fcd10866eb8ea990b](https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-science-health-education-coronavirus-pandemic-a65c9c0375ce441fcd10866eb8ea990b)\n\n[https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/kids-masks-outdoors-cdc/618856/](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/kids-masks-outdoors-cdc/618856/)\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/24/health/who-masks-children-coronavirus/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/24/health/who-masks-children-coronavirus/index.html) \n\nAgain, one instance of an anecdote is all you can give. How about all 50 states? Why do you keep using that as your go to, unless you have no other evidence.\n\nAnd yes because the elderly all are vaccinated! No fucking shit the average age is dropping, all the younger people are less likely to get the vaccine (because they are not at greater risk from it) and they are more likely to attend gatherings. Jeez, if critical thinking comes this hard for you, I dread the future.\n\nplease cite sources :) (especially the ones that say a bit of dirty cloth protects you better than a vaccine). This is just religious virtually signalling at this point.\n\nAuthoritarians like absolutes but OnLY sItHs dEaL wItH aBsOlUtEs (if a Star Wars reference is the best you can give, you got nothing). Sorry the only thing you should be worried about is if people are dying from this thing anymore. They are not.

Seriously, and? People vaccinated for the flu can still get it, people who undergo chemo can see their cancer come back. Were you under the stupid assumption that somehow the vaccines were entirely foolproof from COVID?\n\nIf no one died from it, what point are you even trying to make? \"Some\" literally a fucking couple people got seriously ill.\n\nAnd oh no! Not the children! Will someone think of the children! There are around 75 million kids in the US. How many under the age of 18 have died? Answer: Around 300. Let me repeat, 300 out of 75 million  (which is a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction) have died from this thing. You wanna only count those with COVID, then only 0.008% of kids who have gotten COVID have died.\n\nLike are you seriously this lacking in critical thinking?\n\nRight back at you: Why is it a big deal to you if no one is masking? On a 7 day rolling average, only a dozen people a day die of COVID in Indiana. A dozen. And you want the school, which is pretty much entirely vaccinated, to mask up....what?\n\niF wE uSe aLl tHe WeApOnS iN oUr ArSeNaL man you really need to lay off the kool-aid and bootlicking. Dude, they literally told us like literally two weeks ago that if you are vaccinated, this thing is over for you. Are we gonna do this everytime a new fucking variant pops up? Til the end of time? Hey remember when it was \"two weeks to stop the spread\"?\n\nMan you are insanely easy to manipulate and I am sure those in power just love it when people like you refuse to question their dictates.

The petri dish that was coughed on with now mask had a bunch of bacteria grown on it where as the other one didn't. Ik that viruses are different and smaller but I proves masks do something at least. There still a tiny bit of a pain especially when exercising, but they definitely do something.",

Love how easily you are willing to comply with people that have no evidence, science, or reason to back them up. \n\nAnd dude, the pandemic is over as a public health emergency. They are going to keep on dragging this out and you seem to be thanking them for shoving their dicks down your throat. \n\nThe only people throwing tantrums are those that think we can't make decisions as adults in terms of risk assessment.

And that the normal cloth masks are basically useless because they give you a false sense of security while still allowing droplets to pass through? That \"40% reduction\" was based on centuries old data about the flu, COVID is different. And why is it then that in every country and city from LA to Germany when they have implemented a mask mandate, saw cases spike? \n\nThe timeline here is irrelevant. They didn't mask up for 100 years until they finally got it under control. Like you do know that they have to guess every year which strain of the flu is gonna be more prevalent, with far less efficacy, yet we aren't shutting down society. We have a cure in record time (forgot about that one didn't you), they took far longer to produce one effectively. \n\nFrom the same scientists that said COVID wasn't an issue in the first place (because of their ties to the Wuhan funding)? The same scientists that flip flopped on masks, school openings, vaccines, and also randomly spurred that \"6-feet social distancing\" out of nowhere? Dude, be skeptical of these people, they clearly have fallen in love with the notoriety and control they can exert. \n\nYES IT IS. What more can the government do? The vaccines are available to all Americans, most of the population has taken it and you are more likely to die from Alzheimer's now than from COVID. Idgaf if the rest of the world is having trouble, it was over in the US for months until the politicians decided they couldn't let it go. Delta is on the downturn in the UK and Netherlands (and they didn't need a mask mandate to accomplish it). \n\nWhat's the harm in letting me live my life how I want it? Seems the same administration that loves to tout \"my body my choice\" and that you can't take off women's hijabs seems very adamant (with no real reason) to force you to wear a bit of cloth. The vaccine was never going to be perfect, no COVID is fucking impossible. And what was the \\*point\\* of getting the vaccine if I have to still pretend like I can transmit it? When the entire school is vaccinated, who the fuck is at risk of dying, let alone getting seriously ill? \n\nDelusion is the idea that forcing vaccinated people to wear masks somehow A.) Encourages unvaccinated people to get it B.) That vaccinated people were dying or transmitting this in great numbers and C.) Thinking that people are gonna be okay with this? Why the fuck should I trust the CDC when a couple weeks ago they said unvaccinated people didn't have to wear masks and before that they said that they DID? Like are you serious? These health agencies have flip flopped on everything from vaccine efficacy to COVID's origins to whether kids are in danger. Why in God's name should I trust them? They have not earned it. \"inconvenienced\" dude people have lost their livelihoods, their jobs, their familial relationships, their lives to other diseases and their mental health thanks to these people. These people have cost young people a part of their lives while they feed their own egos with \"more lockdown, vaccine passports, get me on the cover of Rolling Stones\". Give me a fucking break. Sorry, the only people spreading lies and mIsInFoRmAtIoN about Delta are the same ones saying kids need to wear masks and that even though its extremely rare for vaccinated people to get they still need to mask up while saying they need to get vaccinated with no inventive. \n\nI have pointed out several fallacies and instances of lack in critical thinking in what you wrote. And no, it isn't \"all hands on deck\". We are not at war, the vaccines are widely available, there is nothing more to be done. Sorry but since they are coming to the extreme of \"you can't even live life without a vaccine card\" like they are in NYC and France, how long before this becomes the equivalent of China's social credit system. There should be one way to handle it: give people the opportunity to get vaccinated and allow them to make their own risk assessment. Sorry, we don't need some big brother government \"saving\" us. \n\neDiT: No one cares if you have edited for formatting.",

Where is the evidence masks will do better than vaccines? How are you going to encourage people to get the vaccines if the vaccinated can't live life normally? \n\nYou want to wear a mask? All you buddy. I think it is foolish if you are vaccinated but its a free country. Now, don't force me to do the same. \n\nlEgIt ReLiEvEd God that is actually so pathetic.",

Those fatasses are really about to \"drop me on my head\". Tell me how that will look when you have some minorities do the same, because \\*hint\\* they are the ones least vaccinated. \n\nNot exactly gonna look so swell for the campus when you have security tackling people who are vaccinated just because they didn't want to wear a mask. \n\nBut hey, I am glad I am in the presence of such virtuous people, who kneel before the cult of the mask and pray at the alter of public health and government.",

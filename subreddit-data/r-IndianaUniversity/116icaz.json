IU Kelley school of business and A&amp;M Mays school of business. \nA&amp;M is in state for me and hence, lower tuition and lower travel costs (no flights)\nFinancials are important/factor in decision making but not the primary factor.\nWhich one would you choose and any recommendations for me?",

You are able to work in Chicago, Indy, New York and really anywhere in the country with a Kelley degree.\n\nFrom a cost perspective, A&amp;M is definitely the cheaper option and has many good things about the entire campus and Mays. \n\nI would definitely encourage you to look into Indiana and make your decision based off of all the factors",

Likewise, if you have a strong prefence to work for a Texas-based company.     \n    \nIf you are looking  more at Fortune 100 companies, especially those that recruit heavily at Kelley, then the cost differential may make sense to go to Kelley.  Kelley is a great school that is one of the best nationally in most all aspects of business.  It has a very good career services team.",

Placement from Mays to wall street is very minimal compared to Kelley and Kelley simply has a lot more resources and opportunities to break into wall street compared. If you plan on living in Texas post-grad, Mays would be a better choice. However, if you want to do consulting or corporate finance, I would say Mays. Costs end of the day would be the main factor as you can end up with similar careers from either school in those areas.\n\nI would suggest doing your research on what career you want to do (Wall Street Oasis is good). If you know you want to work on wall street, base your decision on that. In either school, you will have to grind to succeed.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any questions",

There\u2019re alot of opportunitites for you if you choose Kelley. All pf the classes are pretty much practical and you\u2019ll be absolutely well-prepared after you graduate qith a Kelley degree.",

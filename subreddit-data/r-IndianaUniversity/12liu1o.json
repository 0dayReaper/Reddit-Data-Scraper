I know there are parking passes available for students, but worry that because I won\u2019t get my decision back until mid June I won\u2019t be able to obtain one. Is there any private parking in town? What are my options? Just searching for some insight.",

If you are living off campus I would recommend Parking there and taking the bus into campus or if you're close enough just bike or bus to get to campus if you are on campus then you can easily just leave your car up at the stadium and get around just fine by foot, bus, or bike.",

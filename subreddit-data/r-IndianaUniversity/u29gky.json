It isn't necessary for undergrads to suffer as a result of the strike. The administration is perfectly capable of sending out instructions like these to faculty, but instead they're sending out instructions to punish the grad students. Priorities.\n\nIU found solutions for continuing instruction during a *pandemic*. It is absurd that they'd suggest they can't find solutions during a strike that takes out a bunch of people that they consider *students first.*\n\nEdit: [Whitten: Students at \u2018Center of the Universe\u2019](https://www.insideindianabusiness.com/articles/whitten-students-at-center-of-the-universe)",

Its why majors and programs have been shuttered in the past.\n\n&gt;those worthless majors and departments make tuition rise\n\nYou haven't established that, you just WANT that to be the case. \n\n&gt;It's clear you have no idea what you are talking about, considering you do not understand basic cost saving measures.\n\nIts not a cost savings if you lose more in funding than what you save but cutting it. \n\n&gt;Meaning if we get rid of useless degrees and departments it will actually make us MUCH better off and especially those kids since they will not be paying high tuition rates for useless degrees in humanities or language.\n\nI mean to begin, imagine thinking foreign language ability is useless, I cant imagine a more smoothbrained take.

Maybe stop going out so much and live more modestly. Maybe actually choose a degree that will pay you a lot more than your \"passion\". \n\n&gt;I think its okay to want that and have my statement about financial motivation hold\n\nNo, it doesn't. Not in the slightest. It makes you look like a hypocrite.\n\n&gt;It isnt \"free\" either\n\nIk buddy but its your crowd that wants less privileged people to pay for your privilege.\n\n&gt;not to you but to anyone who reads\n\nOh my God stop with the politician nonsense. Give me a break, stop being dramatic.\n\n&gt;you keep attacking the amount of money they will make with their degree\n\nOf course I will. They are deserving to be made fun of. It is literally the definition of a bad investment and you are throwing hundreds of thousands of dollars into something that you could be a hobby and you can find online. People like that are why tuition is so high, because you go into useless degrees and the administration spends more money on staff and facilities to compensate. Sorry you should going to college for STEM, not for a PhD in humanities.\n\n&gt;are truly unconditionally passionate about their fields\n\nExcept when they don't get enough money for their bar tabs. Then there are conditions.\n\n&gt;You obviously don't understand how any of this works\n\nI quite obviously do. Sorry if that hurts you. But continue with the superiority complex. No wonder so many normal Americans hate academia.\n\nJust adding context as to why you all look silly.",

And most faculty don\u2019t make much and don\u2019t get cost of living raises annually.  Grad students in my program work 10 hrs a week for 10 months a year, and get health insurance and almost 18k a year plus free tuition, and the job is on-the-job training and experience. Can\u2019t live on that? Get loans and a roommate!",

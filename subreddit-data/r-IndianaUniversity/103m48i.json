    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am currently freaking out about what\u2019s going to happen in 2 weeks. In the fall semester, I have been accused of plagiarism. This is by accident, I didn\u2019t cited correctly, I forgot to add additional sources that I found. I have spoken with my professor and she reported to me. Long story short, I have a received a letter that kinda scared me. I will be doing a hearing in 2 weeks and I\u2019m not sure what to do. This is the first time that has ever happened to me.\n\nUPDATE- This happened on Thursday and I forgot to mention but I received a warning and a seminar. The person who I talked to was very calm and understanding :). She helped me a lot and you guys helped me a lot and I wanted to thank all of you for the help!! :,)",

They use this as a tactic though, the letter itself makes you never want to do this again. You\u2019ll have a meeting with someone from the office that sent you the letter and they\u2019ll just tell you to attend these meetings (they cost $200 but you can attempt to waive the fee) and on top of the meeting whatever sanction your professor agreed upon (in my case I got an F as my final grade in the class). If you miss one of the two meetings you\u2019re fucked and if you get flagged again they\u2019ll consider suspension or probation.",

            "comment": "From the instructor side, this is how the academic misconduct process goes-  \n\n\n* The instructor must \"make a good faith effort\" to meet with the student accused in-person and hear their side of the story (sounds like you've already done this)\n* Instructor then makes a determination if misconduct took place on a \"more likely than not\" (51% sure) basis. If they make a determination that misconduct has taken place, they then make a determination about academic sanctions (which has to be consistent with their syllabus) and they are **required** to report it to the Dean of Students (sounds like this has also happened)\n* Once an instructor submits a report of academic misconduct, it's out of their hands and OSC takes it from there. Note that OSC can't impose academic sanctions if the instructor declines to do so, but they can still impose disciplinary sanctions.\n\nAs others have said, if this is your first time, you'll be fine. Almost nobody faces serious consequences (probation/suspension/expulsion) for a first-time offense. There's no record of misconduct on your transcript, so don't worry too much about it. You also have the right to appeal to OSC, which gives you another chance to argue your case.",

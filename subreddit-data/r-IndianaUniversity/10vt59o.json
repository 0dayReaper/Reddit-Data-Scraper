I'm social, like to party and hope to be surrounded by friendly people who will introduce themselves and make friends quickly. I would prefer being around a group that does like to go out on weekends to parties, but not constantly if that makes sense?\n\n\\-What exactly is the difference between LLC and a dorm? (And how would my experience at JLLC be different)\n\n\\-Where do most business majors live, and how are their social lives? know the business school at IU is tough.\n\n\\-How does rush work for fraternities. I'm from out of state if that makes a difference, so won't know anyone. Best way for me to meet new people and join a frat?\n\n\\-Last question. Is Bloomington a good college town? Do students get bored or are there things to do around?\n\nThanks for all the help!",

One other. It's eluding me ATM. They're known for being very social and lively party scenes. \n\n- An LLC is a \"learning living community\" so you live with people in your major and have group events etc fostered around your major. I didn't live in one, but for example i had a friend in the elementary education LLC, and they had outings/field trips with the whole group to elementary schools etc. A \"normal\" dorm would just be you living on a floor with other people, without curated events to get to know each other or grow in your area or study. Idk what a JLLC is. \n\n- Can't help you with Greek life. \n\n- Bloomington is an AMAZING college town. Lots of restaurants and bars (though you'll have to wait til you're 21... ;) ) within steps of campus. I highly recommend the comedy attic. They have headliners on weekends, and open mic on a weeknight. There's also lots of hiking nearby, and lake Monroe to get outdoors. There are facilities for basically any activity you are interested in, whether on or off campus. \n\nI wish you the best of luck!!",

You have to pay for a dorm along with a $100 fee per semester to be in the JLLC. There\u2019s also a 1.5 credit class you have to take per semester to stay in, and the class is pretty easy but the stuff they make you do such as the PDS events are a waste of time if you major isn\u2019t accounting. Overall, I don\u2019t really like some aspects of the program, and had I known how the process was like probably wouldn\u2019t have applied.",

In terms of resume, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s THE thing that will get you into clubs or internship. But it\u2019s a good filler thing to have on your resume especially as a freshmen with limited activities. So honestly, even if someone isn\u2019t in the program, they are not in a disadvantage.This is just my opinion so take it with a grain of salt.",

While mcnutt is marketed as better because it\u2019s closer to kelley, you\u2019ll probably be taking a lot of gen Ed\u2019s your freshman year. Read is in the dead center of campus. It\u2019s an easy walk to all the math and science buildings, but you sacrifice being about a 5-10 minute walk from kelley (walking like you want to be somewhere). However, you\u2019ll take a total of 4 classes in kelley while the rest are everywhere else. A lot of my friends have said they wished they lived in read given its short distance from classes. \n\n2) you\u2019ll find party people everywhere. IU is one of the top party schools, so there\u2019s always someone who will want to go crazy the first week of school. Just put yourself out there.\n\n3) At LLCs, you live with the same people who will be in your classes. They are VERY focused on school. If you want to find social people who like to party, JLLC might not be for you. I haven\u2019t lived there, but know it\u2019s for the ultra studious kids.\n\n3.5) the kelley school is not as bad as people make it out to be. Obviously I\u2019m only a freshman, but take X170, go to camp kelley, and you\u2019ll have a good foundation. Camp kelley is a super fun experience; it\u2019s not a whole lot of seriousness just fun and games. Work hard and keep up on work and you\u2019ll thrive.\n\n4) I have no input on Greek life; It\u2019s not really my thing.\n\n5) Bloomington is AMAZING! There\u2019s something for everyone. Tons of bars, clubs, and things of that sort if you\u2019re into it. A lot of food that I hear goes crazy when you\u2019re drunk. I\u2019ve only eaten it sober and it\u2019s still bangin so I can only imagine. There\u2019s plenty to do no matter what kinda person you are (partying, introverted, etc.) just find yourself a good group of friends and you\u2019ll never be bored. I love this town and I\u2019m sure you will too.",

            "comment": "It doesn't matter a whole lot. Northwest neighborhood has the most partying and gets in the most amount of trouble. If you want to drink in the dorms and get caught doing it, plus general freshmen dumbassery, go to Northwest. If you want to get in less trouble, just party off campus. \n\nLLCs are sections of dorms that are dedicated to some specific interest. JLLC is for business students, Collins for the artistically and sustainability inclined, etc. \n\nKelley kids live most concentrated in Eigenmann and the Northwest neighborhood. Every student is different. Some Kelley students will actually care and try to get a high GPA and get into the extracurriculars that benefit them. Others party and socialize. You can have both but it's up to you what mixture is appropriate. \n\nCan't help there, but as I understand it, it's basically a bunch of upperclassmen screwing with underclassmen to see how well they fit in. \n\nBloomington is great. It's not a city, but it's got things to do. Plenty of places to drink. The town isn't as fun (but still enjoyable) if you're under 21 (or decide to be 21 two days out of the week. Risky, though).",

You just need to know where they are, and that requires making connections outside of the dorms your first couple of years.\n\nLife is about networking.

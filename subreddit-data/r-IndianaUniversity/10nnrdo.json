    "postText": "Have admission emails for Hutton Honors already gone out for EA applicants? I got in on December 15th and I was so sure I would get into Hutton because I have a 97 gpa and a 1540 sat but I haven\u2019t gotten an acceptance nor a denial yet. My school doesn\u2019t rank if that makes a difference.",

My advice (and the advice I give to all my friends who still ask me registration questions even though we\u2019re about to be seniors) is to utilize Rate My Professor AND the IU grade distribution database. People don\u2019t even know the second one exists and it literally saved me SO much grief in choosing my professors. You basically look them up to see what distribution of As/Bs/Cs etc. they have been giving for each class and semester. It dates back YEARS. I usually just end up picking classes where the professor has a higher distribution of As. \n\nIt\u2019s a good way to protect your GPA with electives, especially since many students have to take gen-eds that may or may not be related to your major or interests.\n\nSource: I\u2019m an extremely busy control freak and a super meticulous planner.",

The class is extremely easy no matter which professor you have. My exams were all online, the final was not cumulative, the topics are really basic, etc. Chem-117 (Principles of Chem and Biochem) is also an easy class but takes a decent amount of studying. If you want a super light schedule I would recommend just knocking out your gen-ed requirements as well as taking the biology class I just mentioned. Your first semester of college will be challenging as you adjust to life alone and taking on more responsibilities, so taking it easy your first semester is never a bad idea. Neuroscience and psychology are both also very easy classes by the way, and is also a requirement for most biology/pre-med students.  Besides rate my professor, I also highly suggest you go on One.iu and check the grade distributions - this is a really helpful tool. Best of luck, and enjoy your summer.",

If you don\u2019t want to take that risk or have a difficult freshman year, go ASU but Kelly is definitely worth it if you can get in.",

While yes, as of right now if you get Bs and above in all of your classes freshman year you will get into Kelley guaranteed, that is not as easy as it sounds.",

Anecdotal evidence is not data, 1. 2, I\u2019m speaking from a data perspective (as in I know the percentages of students who don\u2019t get in), not sour grapes. Almost no one gets in comp reviewed. So many students got in this year thru guaranteed that they are making it tougher so that they can keep the same number of students. That has been a reality for the last few years. Bs may have been very attainable, for you, but that is not the case for everyone, as things outside of school effect academic success just as much as effort. This is just what data of Kelley admits tells us about the likelihood of acceptance thru standard admission looks like, not opinions based off of personal experiences.",

That doesn\u2019t tell us anything\u201d\n\n25% of the entire pool get in through the review. I literally looked at the Excel spreadsheet tracking their official data in the admissions office. \n\nYou said that the odds are tough. That is simply not true. \n\nIn addition to that, you\u2019re the only one who determines if you get in or not.\n\nSo yes. With 75% of all people getting in, and you being able to work consistently ish and still get in no matter what with Bs, it is attainable. \n\nAnd the only way they are making it harder, is you not being able to withdraw from classes. But that\u2019s easily overcomed. Just take finite and Calc at Ivy Tech.\n\nEvery other class you are very much able to get a B in. Even for a poor student.",

I definitely think if you are determined and can put academics ahead of your social life, you should have no problem. I\u2019m not totally sure, but from all the research I\u2019ve done and all the people I\u2019ve asked, it seems like around 40% of standard admits make it into Kelley. If you can get all Bs and above you are guaranteed admission but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s they only way to get into Kelley. You can also have a comprehensive review of your academics to see if you get into Kelley. When I toured Kelley, they told me half of all standard admits are admitted through comprehensive review. It seems like a lot of the classes at Kelley are time consuming, and really anyone can get a B if they put the effort in. If you think you can put school work as your number one priority, then I think you should come to Kelley!",

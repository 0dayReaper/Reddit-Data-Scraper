At Guys and Dollies, we provide one free in-room pick up, one free in-room delivery in August, and free boxes and packing supplies!  Our prices are per-item, which means you only pay for the amount of space you use in our warehouse.  The total cost for the summer is very competitive with self-storage, but you don't have to move the stuff yourself!\n\nWe've been working with IU for 17 years and have helped thousands of students in Bloomington with their storage needs.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call our office at (812)650-4211 or email us at customerservice@GuysAndDollies.com.",

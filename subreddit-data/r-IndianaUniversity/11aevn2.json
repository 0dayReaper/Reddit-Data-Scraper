However, we should no longer blindly believe this, as much as we may want it to be true. Soon, the Media School will be under the leadership of a new dean. Whoever it ends up being will inherit a deficit of more than -$500,000. \n&gt; \n&gt; I cannot say what they will decide to do with the IDS or our finances. Right now, none of us can.",

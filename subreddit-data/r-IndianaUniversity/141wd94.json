    "postText": "Hey there, I was wondering how IU is with their studio art classes and if the courses and staff are good. Are they decent with setting you up for future jobs? I\u2019ve heard IUPUI has better fine arts programs but I like IU Bloomington\u2019s campus much better. Any experience or stories help, thanks!",

            "comment": "I think it depends on what area you\u2019re in. I went to get my BFA in Digital Art because I can market myself in a broad type of digital mediums. I can get a job as a graphic designer, or a social media content creator because I can film, edit and post reels. I could also go the more art world route and make my own art projects that I can get submitted into exhibitions. \n\nI have no comparison to IUPUI classes as I\u2019ve only been a student at Purdue and IU, but all the art classes here are very chill. I\u2019ve grown a lot as an artist in many ways, even from my 100 level classes. They\u2019re not terrifying and looking at ANY fine detail to mark you down a letter grade (like the art classes at Purdue).\n\nHope this helps a lil! :)",

They\u2019ll help you get in contact with the professor and the professor will set up an interview/portfolio review with you (mine was set up with all the professors in the specific program, not sure about everyone though)! So make sure you have stuff to share, be prepared to answer basic questions/talk about your artwork, and express why that specific program will benefit you. Then based on the portfolio/review they\u2019ll tell you if you\u2019re accepted, or to reapply the next semester!",

If you were being loud enough to get dirty looks maybe consider reading the room and quieting down or going somewhere else. \n\nFWIW I have had no problems studying with 1-2 classmates with normal indoor voices in that room. Maybe it is quieter during the middle of the day, I don\u2019t know.",

During weekday mornings and other midday class times, I would agree that there is an unspoken policy of keeping conversations to a low volume, but after about 3PM I would say this drops off and is nonexistent by 6PM onwards. Weekends are way less \"strict\" at all times in my past experience.",

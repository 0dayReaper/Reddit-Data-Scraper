    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m an incoming out of state DA Kelley student who will have to take finite math in the fall. I\u2019ve seen on this sub that it\u2019s difficult and to take it at Ivy tech, but I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s an option for me.\n\nAnything I can do to prepare for the class before hand or any tips to keep in mind as I transition? Thank you so much for your time everyone :)",

As you can see the numbers are all simple numbers, but there are just a lot of them in a single question and one missed (-)negative sign or poorly written 6 that looks like a 0 will mess up the entire problem.\n\nI usually used an entire side of paper for one question, wrote large, and didnt rush in my writing to make sure I didn't misinterpret any numbers. Just do the processes, be precise and you'll do fine.\n\nEdit: might be worth getting a wide ruled notebook or whatever it's called that isn't the smaller college ruled so you can write bigger.\n\nEdit: it tends to get a bad rap because freshman take it and haven't learned how to manage their time/properly study yet and for a lot of them it may be their first time having a teacher who's first language isn't english, so there can be an accent barrier that makes it slightly harder to understand.\n\nEdit: [here is a good video to show you the process, it's simple math, just a lot of little equations](https://youtu.be/0fTSBIBD7Cs)",

They seem to threaten every year that it will change and no longer be accepted. As OOS you will pay higher tuition at Ivy than In state. You can utilize Wyzant online tutoring for support as needed. My kid did that over summer working a full time job and also got one of her Econ classes out of the way online community college same summer. They had a wyzant tutor they would connect w at 10pm at night which worked out well.",

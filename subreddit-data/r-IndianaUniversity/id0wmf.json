How can we avoid that here?\n\nTesting\nIU is protecting you by testing all students before classes start, and we will test all semester. There will be COVID-19 infections, whether you are here or at home. What you do next matters, and it matters a lot.\n\nIf you have a positive test, we intervene immediately. This intervention -- and your candor -- is what gives us our best chance to keep classes in Bloomington.\n\nIf you test positive, you need to be honest with the contact tracers, and you need to follow the rules of isolation.\n\nIf you are a close contact of someone who tests positive, you need to be honest with the contact tracers and follow the rules of quarantine.\n\nIf you are truthful and follow the rules, you will not get in any trouble -- we\u2019ll help you stay current with your classes, and you will give us our best chance to stay open.\n\nBut if you are not truthful, or don\u2019t follow the rules, you will be sent home. We have sent individual students home already for not being truthful or not following the rules, and we will not hesitate to do this.\n\nAnd if enough of you don\u2019t follow the rules, game over. We\u2019ll have to do what other universities have done and go all online.\n\nKeep it safe\nGive yourself and others the best chance:\nAssume for your safety that everyone you meet is infectious, whether they look or feel sick or not: keep your mask on, even outside unless you are distanced, and stay 6 feet or more away from everyone. Know what 6 feet looks like. This rule applies in Bloomington and on campus.\n\nAvoid all parties. Period. Stick with small groups, outside, with masks on.\n\nHold your friends accountable. True friends do not engage in behavior that endangers others or threatens their education.\n\nWe are in this together, Hoosiers. I\u2019m in it with you. Let\u2019s stay in Bloomington.\n \nLauren Robel\nProvost",

The idea is that IU and the city will be safer than not having IU in session and students in residence because we will know about and quarantine the asymptotic.  This certainly does not happen in town, in the schools the children will shortly be returning to, the local folks walking around without masks, and so forth. The fact that there is this quarantine and that local hospitalizations are not rising fast with IU staff suggests it may be working as intended.",

We have learned that students are more concerned about getting in trouble with the University than they are BPD. Both IUPD and the Dean of Students office have been very responsive, but they can't do it alone. It is impossible to be everywhere at once, so if you see something, say something. Even if you just want to call 911, our dispatchers will make sure the report gets to IUPD. The Dean's office will discipline these folks once they get a report with names.\u201d",

You have no idea how much death would be required to obtain herd immunity the \"natural\" way. \n\nAlso herd immunity does not work until AT LEAST 70% of the population is immune. 20% is nothing.\n\nSo lets test how many people have to die in your model. Math is not my strong suit so ill do it step by step.\n\n70% of the US population is 229 Million roughly. \n\nDeath rate for covid 19 varies but lets do a conservative 1%. \n\n1% of 229 million is a 22.9 MILLION deaths. \n\nYou think thats an ok solution?",

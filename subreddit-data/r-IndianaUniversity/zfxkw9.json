    "postText": "Hi I will be moving in next semester as a senior student. I have no idea how's the dorms here are like, but heard there are more chaotic dorms compared to other ones. \n I prioritized a central neighborhood for my housing, and wonder if it could be a good place for a senior student to peacefully rest.\nIn addition, if I chose to have a roommate, is it likely to be assigned with people who are in the same year?",

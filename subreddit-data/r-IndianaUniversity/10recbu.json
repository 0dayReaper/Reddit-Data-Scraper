I just wanted to know if they scan IDs for the student section-- would I be able to use this ticket if I'm not a student?",

I've been to several basketball and football games on a student ticket and haven't been asked for an ID a single time. For basketball, I don't get GA tickets because I don't really want to be in the middle of the traditional students and I'm sure the students don't want me there either. So they *might* check tickets going into the GA section a little closer. I buy the assigned seats and never have any problems.",

I'm in my early 20s still and love the student atmosphere, so if I can snag that student ticket with no issue, I'll do it. Thanks so much for the info!\n\nAlso happy cake day :)",

They aren't going to want members of the public in those sections. \n\nFor IUBB, with the exception of the mini-series games during student breaks, they will sell those tickets at face value, but the rest of their inventory for all games, especially Big Ten season sell out immediately and have a waitlist on top of that. IU Athletics would likely never be selling non- student break games at face value and haven't for awhile. We are sadly at the mercy of the free market on this one.",

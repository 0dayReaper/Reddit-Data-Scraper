    "postText": "\n\nWe are in a quandary. My daughter really wants a single. Not because she\u2019s a recluse, far from it. She\u2019s very social, but\u2014like most people\u2014sometimes she just wants some time to herself. Since students have to choose \u201croommate\u201d or \u201csingle\u201d and don\u2019t really have the opportunity for a backup, she is concerned about her odds of getting a single v. not getting one and then having a random roommate. (I realize there are valuable life lessons to be learned and learning how to deal with less-than-ideal circumstances and all of \u201cthe things\u201d\u2014 I\u2019m not asking about the merits of a double versus a single). \ud83d\ude09 I\u2019m asking who has experience with this. Are there decent \u201codds\u201d of getting a single if you request it? Or should she scramble to find a roommate? Appreciate feedback!",

            "comment": "Odds are pretty low overall as a first year student. Somewhere around 15% of all rooms are singles. Sophomores often take up single rooms as they have priority. Even then- you\u2019re competing against other first year students based upon your housing app date. So if they haven\u2019t even already applied for a single room, then I\u2019d say the chances are very very low.",

            "comment": "Disclaimer: I went to IU in 2013. I also wanted a single (only child....) and I wanted to save money. So I joined a learning living community that required me to do chores once a week and have a certain GPA to have a single room at a reduced rate. It was in Ashton dorms, with the specific building Johnson. It was not nice or glamorous, but I'm glad I did because it was cheap. So my advice is if you're worried about not being guaranteed a single, to join a living learning committee or etc to ensure you get what you want.",

            "comment": "Mom of two recent alums. A) read the housing contract, when they say no guarantee they mean it. Preference is preference. B) No one can predict the demand vs inventory in any year. This current freshman class is approximately 2000 more students over the last three previous record-breaking classes. They are also taking one of the largest mid priced dorms off-line next year for much overdue renovations. C) it absolutely is not true that upperclassman get preference. The significant revenue stream represented by obligatory mandatory freshman housing contracts is vital to the university. \n\nReturning students are offered an opportunity to select housing for next year, but they are picking from a limited inventory, because University holds back what they guesstimate they will need for the future incoming class. \n\nD) it does not matter when you turn in your housing application. It used to. But two years ago they went with a new program where everyone\u2019s housing application gets processed at the same time regardless of when you sent it in. There were so many people who were upset, claiming their kid apply the very first second of the very first day and didn\u2019t get any of their three preferences.\n\n\nE) in the last couple of years they have told people that they might get downgraded from what they have asked for, but will not be placed in something more expensive than what they asked for. What has been happening is there are more students asking for the enhanced more expensive housing than they actually have residential units in that category. F) while it\u2019s a bit of a gamble, the only way to truly guarantee what dorm you are in is to apply to an LLC where you get the notice of acceptance before regular assignments go out. \n\nG) remember that a significant number of kids will either flunk out after the first semester or decide they don\u2019t like it. So even if the initial assignment is not great, your kid has a decent chance of getting reassigned by Christmas. Good luck!",

The university usually says they won\u2019t upgrade someone to something more expensive than they asked for, but they can downgrade you to a lower priced option. This happened to people I know who got placed in Wright and were not please with the conditions. (That place is closed next year for renovations finally).",

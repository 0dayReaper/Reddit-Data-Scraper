    "postText": "Hey Everyone,\n\nI am an engineering student that will be moving to Bloomington for the fall 2023 semester for a co-op. I have done a little bit of digging around online for apartments and have discovered how crazy the apartment situation is there. Which leads me to a few questions. Since I am only going to be living in Bloomington from Aug-Dec I'm not sure if my best option would be to sublet for just fall or sign a full year lease and then sublet it out for the spring semester. Are fall only sublets even a thing here? I know that sometimes sublets for apartments come up if people are studying abroad in fall but they are far and few. \n\nI would also appreciate any recommendations you have on the best apartments in any part of Bloomington, doesn't need to be near campus, but I would really like to live with roommates. Any advice or suggestions are welcome and appreciated! \n\nBest, \n\nA confused engineering student. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: moving to Bloomington for fall 2023 semester only, looking to know best apartments and whether to sublease or sign for a full year",

If you are an IU student it shouldn't be too hard to find a apartment and you can even contact the school for help. ik a friend that was stuck in a lease but had the school negotiate a way for him to get out of it.",

Some people looking for a full year subletter were willing to do just fall if you just ask. I used IU Classifieds. Idk if you have access to that (i assume not) so Facebook market?",

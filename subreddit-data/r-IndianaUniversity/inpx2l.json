This would have been wise for IU as well. Unfortunately the state legislature, along with the precedents set by other Indiana institutions (Purdue, Notre Dame) all impact the decision making of the administration. There was nobody who thought students at large scale were going to be responsible. \n\nThe question is ultimately how many infected, and how many dead will actually be necessary before action is required due to significant public outrage. Yes, this was a money play, in part to keep the university at functional capacity, but to say that it wasn\u2019t heralded in by a confluence of independent motivating factors is naive.",

You have every right to feel bad if you pay for *housing* that you never get to live in, or if you pay *fees* for services that you never get to access, but *if you take a class, then you should be paying tuition because class is what your tuition pays for*.\n\nLet's also note in passing that this is exactly the sort of BS that pushed IU toward having in-person classes in the first place: whiny entitled people complaining about the existence of online classes. You can't have it both ways.\n\n1. Do you think IU should have been all-online this semester? Then stop complaining about online courses!\n2. Do you demand in-person classes? Then stop complaining about the fact that the campus was opened up!\n\n&gt; Sure there are those who do amazingly well and can retain information through an online class, but I for sure don\u2019t. \n\nThat's not the university's fault, man. You don't go to a restaurant, order the food, and then whine about how they're supposedly scamming *you* \\- despite the chef and the ingredients being the same for everyone - simply because you have a cold and your sense of taste is shot. And you don't go to a university, sign up for classes, and then blame the university just because *you* haven't yet learned how to sit still and study.",

How is \"code stealing\" an actual issue? Why would you be working with others at the level of \"what did you have for the third line of code?\" instead of collaborating to figure out the algorithms? \n\nAnd, while I'm not the biggest fan of Zoom, I don't really see how this makes a huge difference in a breakout room with the TA -- raise your hand in Zoom, or send them a quick private chat. Use TeamViewer for quick, easy, safe remote access (we do in our classes; recommend this to your prof/TA if they're not). Personally I like having made my own classroom in gather.town, which lets me walk around the class and talk to students individually or in small groups *much* more easily than Zoom breakout rooms. But there are lots of different solutions to this.\n\nWhat it sounds like to me though is that taking a class online like this requires more effort of you. That's true, it does. It also requires more effort out of your prof and TA. \n\nThat's not the same as having to teach yourself though, as if your prof just said, \"here's the material and some videos, you figure it out.\"",

It shouldn't be known solely as a place to get a credential. It should be a place to learn. A diploma is the certification that you have been taught to a level deemed acceptable by the institution. The quality of the product has been lowered, not only because that classes are not offered in the mode that were promised, but also due to the fact that the last minute scramble of the previous semester to change classes resulted in many professors to lower their own standards or teach in a manner they were unfamiliar with (which is an ongoing struggle for all involved parties). Disregard all of this and focus only on the credentialing side of the institution and you are still left with the fact that currently enrolled students will be less desirable by employers in the the future because employers will recognize that their education has been affected. That is why I think the price should be changed.",

All data from the CDC showed that COVID was not slowing down and anyone with a brain should have known that college students are not going to take social distancing and other safety measures seriously. \n\nAt worst Indiana University has acted recklessly, endangering the Bloomington community and all of their students and staff. But none of that matters to them. They got their checks. Don't forget they even RAISED tuition during a global pandemic while giving us less resources and a worse education. Don't forget they fired a large amount of lower level staff to raise the salary of high ranking admin. \n\nIts not a \"cynical conspiracy theory\". People are getting sick.

There are plenty of photos showing that while I agree with you that the university isn't making the right decisions, the frats aren't even considering safety. I'm not really an outsider to Greek life. I'm not on Greek society's side, I'm not on IU's side, I'm definitely not on the side of anyone who has their honor bound up in the most rapey demographic in society",

You're making up facts here when you paint frats the way you do. Rape is a horrible, gross thing that exists in many communities, including ones you yourself are a part of, and even then its nonsensical to make a blanket statement like \"native american men suck\" or \"DnD players suck\" or \"gaming is rapey.\" Get mad at the national houses for not working with IU, not at the dumbasses who just want to be with their friendgroup.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/style/women-gaming-streaming-harassment-sexism-twitch.html\nhttps://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qbeev7/notallroleplayers-a-history-of-rapey-dungeon-masters",

Comparing this to on campus Greek rape culture is a false argument. I will get mad at anyone I feel is contributing to the endangering of innocent people and prolonging this pandemic. Some might make friends during their time in fraternities, but is that really so sacred we can't examine it as a culture of disregard for anyone deemed other?",

It's a  free* (I mean sure no such thing as a free lunch applies here) weekly PCR test and I've yet to have a turnaround longer than 24hrs, it pales in comparison to fall when if you weren't a live in or out greek you basically were SOL for IU testing and had to go thru the Armory or go to Bedford which is a whole thing (Nothing against Bedford but it's backwards as a concept for the town and uni with more resources to be draining Bedford resources....)  Or go somewhere in Indy.    \nI don't think anyone here is being negative about it but I just wanted to point out how far we've come in a semesters time.",

With the new 24-48 hour TAT, even students who don't isolate at all can only have so many contacts before learning their result. So yeah the in-house labs on campus are huge.",

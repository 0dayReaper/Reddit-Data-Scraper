    "postText": "So I just realized I could\u2019ve picked a much better teacher for one of my Kelley courses and I am now on the waitlist for it. The class is Stat-S 301 and there are 144 people in the class with a waitlist of 6 people. What are my chances of getting off this waitlist and into the class.",

Waitlist the class and see how much it moves and if you\u2019re still waitlisted by the time classes begin, just go to the first class and ask the professor or email them. It\u2019s more flexible than you\u2019d expect most of the time.",

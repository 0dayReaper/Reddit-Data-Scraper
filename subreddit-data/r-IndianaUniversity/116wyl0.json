This one just said motorcycles only with no notice that a permit was required. Any reasonable person would think they would encourage people to take non car alternatives to open up the parking but their priority is money.",

For all they know, you could have renewed your plate but haven\u2019t put the sticker on it yet/are waiting for it to come in the mail. The police are able to look this information up of course, but not parking ops. \n\nThey never towed mine away last year when it expired and was waiting to go home to put the new sticker on.",

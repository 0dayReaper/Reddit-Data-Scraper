This isn't a trait of greek orgs, its a trait of power structures more generally, the jacobs case being a good example. And we can't dismantle all power structures, so a more fruitful path forward is to fortify systems to withstand pressure from any specific interest group, greek or otherwise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Greek societies are separate, but not equal. They're all too often considered above the other student population.

It's 2022.\n\nThis take is pretty outdated. Someone who networks through greek networks is better off than someone who just goes to school and gets their degree, but I really don't think greek networking is more powerful than any other networking in the year 2022. Connections are connections and connections through your greek org don't hold more weight than any other connection anymore IMO. Yeah they can be entitled and it's annoying, but I know just as many people who tried and failed to leverage those connections because they didn't handle their academics. Probably more than the general population tbh due to addiction/strung-out-ness",

Rape is not solely a fraternity issue, it\u2019s a male issue.  As someone in a fraternity, I can guarantee you that we have been and are taking this issue extremely seriously and our guests safety during a party is of utmost importance to us.  And as I have friends in numerous other heavily frequented fraternities on campus, I know they are taking this issue very seriously as well.  \n\nIt\u2019s a fact that at the end of the day, there are some dudes who are just fucked in the head and want to take advantage of a girl.  During rush process screening is supposed to remove those men from potential members but there will always be a couple that slip through the cracks.  And for these guys, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s in their dorm, a fraternity, and a house they live in.  They will be creepy and act creepy.  In a non housed party, very little people are looking out for the safety of women whereas we know their safety is our responsibility and take every precaution to help them.\n\nWhat I am saying is that this is a societal problem and not limited to men in fraternities during parties.\n\nI also know that every person, male and female, in Greek life was very happy parties were allowed to happen again as this is how we have fun.  Every single girl I know wanted parties to resume.  \n\n\u201cCanceling\u201d Greek life and alienating a large and arguably the most visible student population on campus is not the answer.\n\nThe answer is our generation creating a more perfect society and raising young men and women who respect the opposite gender.",

It is refreshing to hear from all the current brothers commenting about their commitment to respecting the safety of your fellow Hoosiers in Greek life.     \nNow when I check your post history to make sure you aren't a 50 year old alum there isn't going to be some stupid tone-death stateme-   \n&gt; Ya. They told them they had to do coke or suck a guys dick. Quickly after said they were joking. Sure I can see how it can be an uncomfortable experience, but PTSD and sexual harassment? Not so sure   \n \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/m5w6am/kappa_kappa_gamma_sorority_suspended_over_hazing/gr65qhg/    \nJfc this is more embarrasing for Greek life at this point than anything.    \nPSA: if you are going to defend Greek life as an institution in this thread, you should do it from an account where your post history isn't full of dumb shit like this",

Every time something like this happens, the comments are full of people who have never been apart of the Greek system, and couldn\u2019t tell you a single thing about the Greek system. They say nonsensical things and make ridiculous claims because they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. \n\nIt\u2019s quite simple. When you have knowledge on a subject, and you hear someone talking who is clearly ignorant on the subject, it\u2019s quite obvious. Anytime someone is attempting to make definitive statements on fraternities and sororities, and it\u2019s clear they\u2019ve never been anywhere near actually being informed about them, they sound stupid. That\u2019s what I\u2019m getting at",

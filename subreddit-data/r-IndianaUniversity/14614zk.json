The professor is a bit painful to listen to and many people don't find her lectures to be particularly useful. She will provide you with an online set of readings, if you read and understand them very well then you will be fine for the exam.",

It\u2019s a shame to hear that the lectures are not viewed as useful, as that is the only thing I paid attention to in that class",

However, if it is a class you are worried about taking, I would recommend taking EDUX-105 , which is a help class for A100. There are TAs who help cover the material which would be covered in A100, and it is also generally an easy A, if you do the short assignments.",

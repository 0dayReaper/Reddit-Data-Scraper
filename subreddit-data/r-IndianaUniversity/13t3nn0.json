Perfect for staying focused during my night study sessions. Hope this can help you too :) \n\n[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6NXv1wqHlUUV8qChdDNTuR?si=baqzVJL-TN-JI65G7Qa3mw](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6NXv1wqHlUUV8qChdDNTuR?si=baqzVJL-TN-JI65G7Qa3mw) \n\nFeel free to share yours \n\nH-Music",

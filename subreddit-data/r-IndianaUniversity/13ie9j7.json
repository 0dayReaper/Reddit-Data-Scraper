            "comment": "Definitely sleezy vibes. It's also right next to Verve so it will be loud especially on the weekends and the first few weeks of school in August. Also, the fire alarms at 3 am will probably wake you up in Vivo, they're that loud. As someone who lives at Verve, I always feel bad for the people at Vivo because they're so close and right up against Verve. You can easily see into people's rooms at Vivo if their curtains aren't closed, it's that close to each other.",

            "comment": "Lived there from August to January because I was moving out of Bloomington in January (or was planning to at the time) and it was the only place I could find that was both reasonably near campus and allowed for month-to-month leases. IMO if you're planning on staying in Bloomington for a regular school year, there are better options for cheaper. And Verve next door will wake you up in the middle of the night every few days (sometimes with a fire alarm). But my overall experience with Vivo management wasn't bad--it's just that you can probably find a studio or one bedroom apartment within walking distance to campus for half the price.",

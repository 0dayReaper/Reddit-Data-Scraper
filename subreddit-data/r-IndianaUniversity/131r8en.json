    "postText": "Hello all! A friendly post from a full time staff member at IU to remind you what your resources are as a student. Finals can be a stressful time, and with a big transition from spring to summer coming, change can be hard. But you're not alone, and there is help if you need it. \n\nStudents can contact the health center/CAPS 24/7 through the crisis hotline.  **812-855-5711, option 1** or contact your local hospital emergency department. You may also call the **988** Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline, a national network of local crisis centers that provides free and confidential emotional support to people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress \n\nCAPS will also ALWAYS take walk-ins if you're in crisis. If you need help, you can ask a friend, RA, faculty member, TA, ANYONE to go with you over to CAPS and they will assist you. You don't have to do this alone. \n\nIf you live in the residence halls, during business hours you can go down to the front desk, and a full time staff member can be found to assist you. After hours, there are always staff on call to assist as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease remember you're never a bother. Your issues aren't too small to seek help. There are staff who's entire job is to help you be successful as a person and a student. Let them help you, because you deserve it &lt;3 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you know of more resources, please share in the comments!",

But that\u2019s not my point just with a simplistic view looking at the other colleges ranked #8 by US News: UNC, Southern California, UVA, Cornell. Those schools are all very very hard to get into impossible for most people. Then Kelley is also ranked #8 but if you get a 3.8 and 1370 which most people at my school have, you are GUARANTEED to get direct admission! isn\u2019t that kinda crazy?? It\u2019s not just slightly better stats for Cornell you need at like a 4.5+ it\u2019s an Ivy League for UVA and UNC you need a 4.4+ and even with those stats you can get rejected I\u2019ve seen tons of people get those stats and get rejected. My friend got a 1590 on the SAT and had a 4.6 GPA and was rejected from Cornell. So isn\u2019t it crazy how Kelley which is ranked the same as all those schools GUARANTEES direct admission as long as you have a 3.8+ and 1370+?????",

Versus maybe .1% who get a 4.3 and a 1550. \n\n1.9% is an incredibly small number. The school understands that\u2019s not going to be the difference maker. \n\nI know standard admission people who are on Wall Street now, making 150,000 out of undergrad, and I know 1600s who are failing courses. \n\nThe difference is what you do afterwards. Not the 1.9%.",

I believe that Kelley (very sadly) removed their automatic standard admission policy, but it looks like you still have guaranteed direct admission if you meet the requirements. Just make sure to get your application in on time, and if they still make you write an essay or two, still put effort in.\n-\nAnother thing, don\u2019t be afraid to email the admissions team at: \n\nhttps://kelley.iu.edu/programs/undergrad/admissions/index.html\n\nWhen I was applying after my first year for standard admissions, I nervously emailed senior admissions director personally (which I do not recommend you do, lol, use that link) but they were still very nice with their responses.\n-\nSorry if the formatting is off, I\u2019m not great at using this app.",

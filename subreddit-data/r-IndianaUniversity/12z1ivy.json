I was just wondering what things IU has to offer. Like what are some good places/ experiences you\u2019ve had at IU.",

            "comment": "I have honestly loved IU! First of all, IU was not my first choice and took numerous visits, a rejection letter from my dream school and lots of financial aid before I accepted my fate. I am a sophomore currently and have really found my place here. The campus is absolutely beautiful, even in the winter and when the sun pops out. IMO, IU is a basketball school and the atomosphere in Assembly Hall is electric. The university offices and sanctioned-groups put on events all year round and they make for something interesting throughout each semester. The people are pretty friendly and theres just an overall great feeling when walking about campus. I haven't had one terrible experience here, though I am one person out of over 40,000.\n\nBloomington has a lot to offer, especially compared to West Lafayette. The mall is minutes away from campus, lots of grocery stores, cute restuarants, and outdoor adventures. \n\nPlaces I like to eat are:\n\nBruster's- Ice Cream\n\nSiam House- Thai food\n\nMura- Sushi and korean\n\nRuncible Spoon- breakfast\n\nSoma- coffee\n\nParlour- doughnuts\n\nSunny Poke- boba and poke bowls\n\nMorganstern's- coffee and it's also a bookstore!\n\nHaha, thats just to name a few. I'm a foodie and love coffee, so I do get to try a lot of local food spots.\n\nHope you become comfortable and enjoy your time here at IU!",

            "comment": "Firstly I want to say congratulations!\n\nIMO, the first things that I think will stand out to you is campus; its a very different vibe physically (layout, architecture, generally being way prettier). Anytime I feel down I just take a walk around campus and it never gets old, I am continuously mesmerized by the sheer beauty of this place.\n\nYou'll still find plenty of organizations putting on the usual campus activities which are always fun and there's about a bajillion clubs and organizations to join. \n\nIf you are 21 then Bloomington has West Lafayette beat six way from Sunday, hands down; practically every 3rd business within a mile of sample gates is a bar, pub, or club; lots of fun to be had.\n\nIf you're musically inclined, then this place in teeming with talent. The All Campus ensembles are open to any student, not just majors, and the Marching Hundred is a great group that spread hijinks and hilarity wherever they roam, plus this place is just crawling with independent musicians not in Jacobs if you just wanna find a jam buddy\n\nPlus even if you don't play you get nearly constant free concerts from world class ensembles all year, with indie bands and performers out all the time. \n\nThe sports here are definitely next level too. Generally we are a very athletic school with nearly all sports seeing great student support, but when they say we are a basketball school they mean it. Its ride or die here, through and through. If you have even a passing interest in men's or women's basketball, then you will be a superfan by February at the latest. \n\nThe people here are great too. I have legit not yet had a bad experience with a person since I've been here (knock on wood lol) but generally everyone here is really nice and caring. The official tour-guide-ese word would be our \"culture of care\" \n\nAll in all, I love this place and I think you might just come to like it too",

I\u2019m really looking forward to exploring campus and everything it has to offer, especially since I was born in Bloomington and haven\u2019t been back much since I was a baby. I really appreciate all you said and I hope I can love IU as much as you do:)",

            "comment": "I grew up in West Lafayette, minutes away from Purdue because my parent is a professor there. I chose to go to IU originally for their music school but also because I wanted to get away. To be honest IU doesn\u2019t feel that much different than Purdue. Like yea there\u2019s different restaurants, the campuses are greatly different, etc., but the environment feels the exact same. It\u2019s still the same small-town college feel. I don\u2019t actually think you\u2019ll feel a huge different environment wise\u2014you\u2019ll just have to become more familiar with the lay out of the campus. \n\nIU and Purdue are both very similar regarding campus &amp; student life, greek life, and the number of student organizations. IU is so big that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find your group of people.\n\nAlso, reading through the replies to this and yeah I agree WL and Bloom are different, they are also the same. And despite what all the comments are saying, there\u2019s way more to do in West Lafayette than Bloom bc WL is connected to Lafayette. Lafayette is about the size of Bloom so there\u2019s more things to do with friends and stuff. BUT the positive side of IU is I think the campus is much prettier. \n\nI love IU and I\u2019m so glad I picked going here than Purdue and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love it here, but if I\u2019m being completely honest I don\u2019t think the social/general atmosphere is much different.",

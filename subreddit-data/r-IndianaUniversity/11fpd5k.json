    "postText": "Hi, new to this sub and kinda Reddit and looking for advice. I got onto Iu (kelley da) and have some questions for current students in kelley.\n\nMy biggest concern is the size of the business school, being over 10,000 students. Does this make it harder for you to seek help, get academic and career resources, get to know professors? With this size, it is competitive to get into clubs/programs etc? \n\nAlso, how is the student body there. Nerdy? Outgoing? Mix? Focused? \n\nI appreciate any advice guys. Super torn between IU and Purdue just cuz kranner is a smaller program with probably more support. I am looking for a good balance between having fun and strong business program (accounting finance) Looking for (somewhat) unbiased advice if that\u2019s possible lol. Thanks!",

            "comment": "&gt;Does this make it harder for you to seek help, get academic and career resources\n\nMany of the Kelley students that I have met are in an LLC or the Honors College (biased perspective as someone who is in the JLLC). Options like these provide resume writing, club, volunteering, student council, and other academic guidance opportunities not given by Kelley or IU. Business Frats, which you can apply for within the first few months of the semester also provide these academic opportunities.\n\n&gt;get to know professors?\n\nI can say confidently that this will depend on your major. Finance majors (off the top of my head), especially those in entry level classes will struggle to differentiate themself among their accomplished peers enough to make a connection with professors. It's a tough school, you have to earn your connections. Beyond networking however, office hours and campus tutoring is reliable and there if you're looking for it. \n\n&gt;With this size, it is competitive to get into clubs/programs etc?\n\nYes. Kelley is definitely more competitive when it comes to clubs, business frats, LLCs (debatable), and programs like ACE due to the extensive funding and prestige many of these opportunities procure. \n\n&gt;Also, how is the student body there. Nerdy? Outgoing? Mix? Focused?\n\nFor the most part in my experience at Kelley, a majority of the Kelley students mirror the party culture of the greater IU. Kelley students are outgoing, but often... strange and painfully clique-y if you're a woman. There are genuine people however, in my experience I had to sort through quite a few interesting individuals to find my way. \n\n&gt; Super torn between IU and Purdue just cuz kranner is a smaller program with probably more support\n\nBoiler down.",

            "comment": "I have the same concerns about the size of the school and how the best resources that are what attracted me to apply to the school seemed to be reserved for an elite few. For context, SAT 1520, unweighted GPA=4.0, underrepresented minority, and was not even invited to apply to ACE. Sent two emails and didn\u2019t even get a response.   \n\n\nRecruiting at other schools are mostly through clubs, at least for front of the office jobs. What about Kelley? \n\n  \nIs there a difference in class size for general and business courses if you\u2019re in Hutton?   \nI know there is a difference if you\u2019re in ACE and business honors. \n\nDo large classes have smaller discussion groups/sessions?",

                    "comment": "Tbh, don't fret about getting ACE. It is not a huge factor when it comes to recruiting. \n\nThe majority of the recruitment comes from the workshops at Kelley. Focus on getting into these workshops if you want a stellar job out of Kelley. Getting into the workshops isn't an easy task (IBW, IMW, CMW, CW) so be prepared to really grind if you want to get into them. \n\nTo note, ACE is there to only make the process to get into Kelley Honors easier (3.7+ GPA). The opportunities provided with ACE aren't much compared to the clubs on campus. There are a lot of people who are successful and working at notable firms who aren't in the ACE program. End of the day, it's the effort you put in that counts.",

Others view it as there\u2019s no way I\u2019m the worst out of 10,000, so they\u2019re fine with being outgoing to look for help. Except for huge lecture classes, it\u2019ll be very easy to go to office hours and have some alone time to ask questions of the professor, especially as the semester goes on. It\u2019s fairly competitive for some clubs, but most are welcoming to almost everyone, and offer the same possible benefits but require a little more work. At Kelley specifically, there\u2019s a lot of everything when it comes to types of people. Nerds, social kids, frat and sorority kids, everything under the sun. I will say you can gain just as much from a social frat as a business frat, so keep that in mind. \n\nWhen it comes to Purdue vs IU, I would go to IU for anything business related. If you wanted a comp sci, informatics, etc, I would go to Purdue. IUs business school and school itself is very well ranked, very fun, and very good at job placement.",

There are the nerdy kids and the chill frat people but everyone here is very outgoing and easy to talk to. I found it easy to find the people I want to be around. \n\nSince you mentioned you want to do Finance/Accounting, I can definitely give you more insight into the Finance side of things. \n\nClubs here are competitive. Everyone who is doing Finance is trying to do their best to differentiate themselves from one another. I would say networking and talking to upperclassmen is crucial (especially if you decide you want to build a career in Finance). However, a lot of it is really just a huge grind. If you are not willing to put in the effort to get into the selective clubs/workshops, you will have a tougher time trying to come out of Kelley with a really good job. A lot of it is really on your own basis. Kelley offers a lot of resources and you can take advantage of them. \n\nEnd of the day, you know yourself the best. If you are willing to put the effort in for your freshman year and look forward to a decent grind, then go for it. I don't have any insight into Kranner. With any college you decide to go to, it is up to do how you want make do with your experience.",

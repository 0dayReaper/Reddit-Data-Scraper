I also don\u2019t mind undergrads, noise, parties, or shared bathrooms etc. I just want the space to be organized, have all necessary utilities, and preferably have a room to myself. \n\nWhich neighborhood would you recommend for an international grad student? I feel like I can\u2019t put together an unfurnished apartment and make it homely.",

Its pretty easy to find furniture at the beginning and ends of the semesters when people just put their stuff out on the curbs, and that's exactly where all the furniture in our apartment came from lol so it was pretty easy to make the place feel homey. \n\nThere are tons of international students here too, and it's usually pretty quiet, but sometimes the noise from the frat houses near here can be annoying on the weekends. Utilities and wifi are included, so you only need to worry about the rent which is nice. I'd recommend it here for sure, imo tuilip tree is a bit more rowdy.",

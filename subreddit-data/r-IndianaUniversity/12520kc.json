People transferring are likely doing so because they are freshman who weren\u2019t fully ready for college level classes and responsibility.",

There are plenty of opportunities to get great finance jobs outside of the IBW and while sometimes there is pressure, you will come to find that people put that pressure upon themselves. Kelley is really what you make of it. There are all sorts of paths to great careers both in finance and other aspects of business that you can find, being in a workshop is not the be all and end all (although it does help a lot, I won't lie)",

So the fact that the workshop is competitive is sort of the point, I think.\n\nBut even if you don\u2019t get into the IBW\u2014as others pointed out\u2014there are lots of other options and choices. The IBW definitely helps with placement, but if you bust your tail and network well, you can find placements outside the workshops as well.\n\nSimply put: if you come out of Kelley with nothing more than a degree from Kelley, you\u2019ll be OK.",

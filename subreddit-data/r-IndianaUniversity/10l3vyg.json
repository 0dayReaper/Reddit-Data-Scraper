Does anyone know how quickly they respond to applications so I'm not checking my email obsessively every hour for the next three months? thanks! Also, what has your experience in Bloomington been like?",

Haven\u2019t started yet. Signed up for Spring but deferred for a mental health break and also had a heart attack two weeks before the semester start date.",

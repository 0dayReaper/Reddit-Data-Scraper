    "postText": "hey guys, im an oos undergrad prospective student at the kelley school of business (direct admit), planning on majoring in finance, and ideally making it to the IBW. im trying to decide between a couple of colleges atm, and saw across the internet that kelley has \u201cexcellent career services.\u201d i was just wondering - how does that manifest, in a tangible sense? so far i have only come across kelley connect. but i also see from the co22 data that kelley produces spectacular starting salaries. so i guess another question i have, is why do more people not attend Kelley? for instance, it\u2019s similar paying to a school like CMU which is nearly twice as expensive. why just not study at kelley instead?\n\nany help would be appreciated! thanks!",

A lot of the stuff they provide you might not see or is harder to find as someone that is not a current student. Kelley has made really good connections with recruiters from top companies like Deloitte or BCG and that helps too. A lot of kids that attend are from either Indiana or Illinois and more than half of all students get a a job in Illinois (Chicago). I don\u2019t know why for sure more people don\u2019t attend Kelley but I will say that it being the only public university while the other top 10 business schools are private universities might factor in.",

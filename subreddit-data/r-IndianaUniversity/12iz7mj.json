Would they still consider me a freshman even though I\u2019ll be 21 at the time? Would I share a dorm and if I do will I get some person fresh out of high school?",

Your age has nothing to do with your class. You start at the beginning unless you have college credits eligible for transfer.\n\n&gt;Would I share a dorm and if I do will I get some person fresh out of high school?\n\nYou are not required to live in a dorm. With access to the GI bill and the BAH it pays out I would reccomend not enrolling in traditional campus housing. Go get an apartment. However, if you opted to live in the dorm I'm sure you would be paired with another first year. 18 and 21 are so close I bet you'd have a blast meeting new people, and you certainly wouldn't be out of place or weird.\n\nContact the Center for Veteran and Military Students there on campus. They'll get you sorted.",

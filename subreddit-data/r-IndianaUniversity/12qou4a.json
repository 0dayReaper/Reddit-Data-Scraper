The advantage of a school the size of IUB is that you can find your community if you make an effort.\n\nBloomington is a great place to spend your college years, and there are a million of things to do in terms of activities, sports, clubs on and off campus.  It\u2019s all what you make of it.\n\nThere are thousands of students at IU who eschew the party life.  You\u2019ll find \u201cyour people\u201d if you try.\n\nBesides, you\u2019re going to school to learn and get a degree.  They don\u2019t give out a BA in frat parties or beer bongs at the Villas.  \n\nBest of luck in your decision.",

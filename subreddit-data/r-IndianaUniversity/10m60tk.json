    "postText": "Hi everyone, apologies for format issues as this is my first post and I\u2019m on my iPhone. \n\nThis summer, I\u2019d like to take foreign language courses at my local community college. Unfortunately, the language I want to take (Polish) is only available as a continuing education/adult education class, and not for official college credit. While I\u2019m not a current student at IU, I\u2019m hoping to transfer in the fall, and I was wondering if I would have a chance to petition for my language classes to count towards the language distribution. If not, is there a placement exam I could take to access a higher level of Polish if/when I begin my time at IU?",

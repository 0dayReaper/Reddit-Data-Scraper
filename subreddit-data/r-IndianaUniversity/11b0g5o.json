You\u2019re not gonna find a significant difference in dorm quality unless you get stuck in Wright. But you don\u2019t choose your form anyway you request a location (central, northwest, southeast) and they choose off of that. If you\u2019re in Kelley then central or northwest are probably your best bets. Southeast is probably too far. You could also do JLLC and get into McNutt which is a fine dorm.",

Some of the on campus apartments are pretty lacking. For your first year you\u2019re going to be taking a lot of gen Ed\u2019s and Kelly requirements so you want something close to everything. I recommend putting southeast or central to be in the middle of everything.",

Keep going down the list til you see where your stats fall. Target schools around there. \n\nMaybe apply to a few above, and a few below, so you shoot your shot and also have some secure options. \n\nThen do research on the schools you think are a good fit. Look at campus life, area, price, etc.  \n\nYou should have a good handful after all that",

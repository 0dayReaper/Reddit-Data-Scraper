            "comment": "Here's my legitimate question - having been employed by the university years ago as a student instructor -\n\nWhy do graduate students need a union?\n\nThat messaging isn't clear right now. The only messaging is \"want union\" and we're all expected to either be pro or anti union.\n\nIt's more complicated than that. Knowing reasons is important. Messaging that includes a clear list of grievances is essential. (See the declaration of independence.)\n\n\nMy sense of it right now, based on my recollection of doing that kind of work, it's not that bad. It's pretty easy to do, you work often for a mentor who is going to let work slide if you need to study for that big exam, and you get a chance to helm a classroom and gain valuable experience in academia from the other side of the mezzanine.\n\nSo, for someone like me who is generally progressive minded... I think - well what about the grad students who don't have these cushy jobs busting ass in the service industry or showing ass on only fans to pay tuition?\n\nI fully acknowledge this is whataboutism. But it has its place in checking privilege and placing movements into context.\n\nI don't write this to be critical in any negative way. I fully believe anyone who sells labor has a right to meaningful representation in bargaining with management. It's a constructive criticism. \n\nI studied history- and one of the clear patterns was when students and labor built bridges real change accelerates. Getting something like this right could be a watershed moment in everything that is wrong right now.\n\nBut - at the heart of it is how corporate higher education is becoming. It's supposed to be a place for thinkers to be left alone and do critical thinking about important things without the pressure to succeed for the sake of profit.\n\nWe've turned it into something ugly. High School 2. More conditioning to serve corporate American agendas. From a certain point of view graduate students on strike demanding a union is one small step for workers rights- one giant leap in messaging that higher education is now a corporate institution.\n\nI don't know how all of that gets fixed. I don't think any of us do really. The world today that directly effects us exists so far beyond our own monkeysphere... it's impossible to even agree on the problems let alone take meaningful action.\n\nI write as a critical supporter. I want the grad students to win - I just want better messaging about grievances and demands. Especially grievances- because educated labor and manual labor deal with the exact same kinds of managerial bullshit.\n\nGetting offended over language is exactly how movements get derailed. I don't care how sexist or racist someone who does back breaking work is - that person understands getting fucked by the man. And that's a bridge to meaningful, productive dialog.\n\nIf the messaging can generally unite the toiling persons with the thinking persons against the lazy user persons - history shows us big change is possible.\n\n*hey everybody - I get that the days of reddiquite are long gone. But this was a better place when people didn't just downvote opinions they didn't like. What I'm doing by expressing criticism is engaging in what should be a productive dialog. Nobody is beyond criticism. You all are right, I didn't read the article. I commented on a general perception based on casual consumption of the issue. That's so much more valuable than simply commenting \"I support you guys\" because that's how most people relate to this issue. With minimal engagement.",

I'd strongly recommend checking out the website - if you're new to learning about our union and why that's the best pathway, it has a very comprehensive group of info! indianagradworkers.org\n\nAnother key point to remember: IU tuition keeps going up, enrollments hit an all-time high last year, the cost of living in Bloomington (esp housing) keeps increasing. But instructors, including Grad Workers, aren't seeing any increase in our wages. That money is largely going to inflated IU administrator salaries. It should be going toward education.",

His dad graduated from what became IU law in Indy in the 1920s.\n\nMy mother was a board member at Ball State where she actively campaigned for more diversity on the board and successfully maneuvered to hire a female president. Her number one concern was the rising cost of living and the expensive capital projects that drove those cost up.\n\nShe cried her way home from just about every board meeting because they were awful to her. They belittled her concerns while they wined and dined shoddy people profiting big time on the backs of students.\n\n----\n\nI come from a very old progressive political family. My grandfather lost a race for Marion County Prosecutor in the 1970s because one of his campaign promises was to end the quota filling practice of rolling through black neighborhoods and rounding people up. My dad was a coauthor of the 65' Civil Rights voting act. I was in Zuccotti Park for Occupy Wallstreet as a student and I interned for Congress. I actually spent a great deal of time hanging around Occupy Bloomington. I watched all of that enthusiasm and excitement for change just kind of fizzle out. Now I'm an attorney with a focus on criminal justice reform - but I also care about unions. My grandfather wrote labor law in congress in the 1940s.\n\nWhich is all to say, I am very interested in this strike and I hope I can find more ways to support it than simple constructive criticism.",

Right now, IU has all the power. That is why we are often one of the lowest priorities for the IU Administration. For instance, for the six years between 2014 and 2020, the vast majority of graduate employees at IU did not receive a raise. This, despite IU\u2019s $2.4 billion endowment and an enormously successful Bicentennial fundraising drive.  During this same time, student fees went up every year, which means for six years, graduate workers received pay cuts. By organizing a union that represents that vast majority of graduate workers, we will have the power to bring our issues as workers to the university and negotiate with them as equals.\n\n...\n\n&gt; **What will change if we organize a union?**\n\n&gt; Right now each grad employee must negotiate over their own wages and working conditions for themselves with their department. This usually doesn\u2019t work well because we are just one person against the entire university. With a union, there will be a collective process where we leverage our numbers and our power to create higher standards for all.\n\n&gt; We will form a negotiating committee with members from across the university to bargain directly with IU over the issues that concern graduate workers.\n\nThere's more on the site, including a lot of into about pay (#s).\n\n\nAlso: **Personal Stories, ABOUT HOW FEES AFFECT THE LIVES OF IUB GRADUATE WORKERS**\nhttps://www.indianagradworkers.org/personal-stories-page\n\n&gt; \u201cI had to lose a tooth because I had to choose between paying the student fees or paying for dental care last year.\u201d\n&gt; \u2014 Anonymous\n\n&gt; \u201c[Fees are] an effective reduction in salary (around 10% of my stipend).\u201d\n&gt; \u2014 Anonymous, Music Theory\n\n&gt; \u201cClose to broke every year, and sometimes had to accept money from my family.\u201d\n&gt; \u2014 Anonymous, ILS\n\netc.",

Independent wealth should not be required for graduate school.\u201d\u201d\n\u2014 Anonymous, Philosophy\n\n\u201cAfter the nearly $3,000 in fees I pay per year, my salary isn\u2019t enough to pay for my living expenses let alone the supplies I need for my coursework. I work three jobs to scrape together enough to pay my bills and my work suffers because I constantly have to prioritize living expenses over supplies.\u201d\n\u2014 Kathryn Combs, SOAD\n\n\u201cThe fees are around $3000 per year, which means 2 months salary!

That means paying us a living wage, and it means not immediately turning around and asking us to give back significant parts of our pay through fees.\u201d\n\u2014 Steve Hussung, Mathematics\n\n\u201cDue to the huge amount of fees, it basically means I have no savings, or any money left to spend on my physical or mental health issues/ emergencies. I can\u2019t tell all this to my parents either, as they would refuse to accept the money I send to help them if they knew.\u201d\n\u2014 Sanjana Agarwal, Mathematics\n\n\u201cThe delay between our first stipend check and the imposition of fees (especially when I was in coursework) often meant I couldn\u2019t do anything, especially conferences or travel, for a few months because I was broke from the fees. I had to go several months with severe back spasms because I couldn\u2019t afford treatment due to the fees, which, obviously, had a dramatic effect on my research and teaching (it\u2019s hard to do either when there are days you can hardly stand).\u201d\n\u2014 Jesse Balzer, Media School\n\n\u201cAny time I have professionalization opportunities, I have to scramble, or miss out on conferences, networking, etc.\u201d\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\n\u201cI even have to ask money from my parents while I am having a job, which is overall quite embarrassing for me and sometimes leads to stress based psychological problems.\u201d\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\n\u201cExpensive, put them on credit cards when I haven\u2019t been paid yet.

Effectively, one more professionalization opportunity missed.\u201d\n\u2014 Anonymous, Mathematics\n\n\u201cThere is little transparency about why these fees come out of our pockets, which is especially strange in a PUBLIC institution such as IU.\u201d\n\u2014 Danial Qaurooni, SICE\n\nThe lack of a summer stipend has placed a growing pressure on my broader financial stability. Before the school year even begins, grad students are obligated to pay fees before we\u2019ve even received our first paycheck. This has forced me to put most of my bills and living costs on credit cards, which only adds to my economic insecurity.\u201d\n\u2014 Denisa Jashari, History\n\n\u201cMany grad workers enter the school year already in debt from not being paid in the summer. Now they have to take even more debt to cover fees. Many of those same grad workers are unable to find jobs after graduation, which means they leave programs in tens of thousands of dollars of debt and without job prospects.\u201d\n\u2014 Valentina Luketa, Anthropology\n\n\u201cI am in desperate need of dental and other medical care that I can\u2019t afford. Owing to the inexplicably late date of the first stipend check (Sept 6, or two weeks after the semester began), I have been struggling to have enough food. I\u2019ve been eating top ramen, eggs, and oatmeal for weeks. I had to ask for help from friends and family to cover my rent 2 months in a row, and I haven\u2019t bought my textbooks because I have to wait till I get paid... and still have to face the fact that my first stipend check will cover almost literally ONLY my student fees and I still won\u2019t be able to make rent for the third month in a row. We are already live well below the poverty line\u2014the fees are seriously crushing.\u201d\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\n\u201cI am fortunate to be in a STEM program which offers a somewhat higher stipend than the average grad student on campus. It allows you to live very modestly, but under the assumption that nothing beyond food, rent, and fees will ever come up. There\u2019s a constant anxiety about the \u2018what if\u2019 emergencies that would shatter any sense of stability. As someone with chronic health problems, those unexpected costs become expected. In my 3+ years at IU I\u2019ve used everything I had in savings, put off physical therapy (twice), had to choose which medications were the highest priority to buy and forego the rest, had to accept help from a sibling and a significant other, and had to take a second job. The nearly $3,000 in fees each year crushes any last hope of making progress towards a lifestyle with stability and health &amp; wellness.\u201d\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\n\u201cI have been in my graduate program for only one year and I have $3,000 less in my bank account than I did when I started. My salary doesn\u2019t cover my very modest standard of living, and the fees and taxes I have to pay have already drained my bank account. I take the bus, I cook my own meals, I have a roommate, I do not spend extravagantly, and yet I do not feel financially secure. It keeps me up at night, thinking if I can even afford to be a graduate student. I have to think about putting life goals like a wedding, and children aside because I simply cannot afford a family, and it breaks my heart. Is going into debt to get a PhD worth the personal sacrifice?\u201d\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\n\u201cHaving to pay fees that I can\u2019t afford means I have to depend on help from my parents, which is stressful.\"\n\u2014 Tyler Erickson, Music Theory\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have to pay the fees, I would spend this money to pay rent and food.\u201d\n\u2014 Peter Cho, Music Theory\n\n\u201cLast semester I had four days of panic attacks regarding fees.\u201d\n\u2014 Hayley Abramowitz, Jacobs\n\nI'm not trying to be an ass, I'm just saying, these things are out there...",

When I get the impression that the sub isn't interested in updates, I'll stop posting them/slow down. In the meantime I'll probably keep doing text posts to highlight the new stuff if the post titles keep looking so similar.",

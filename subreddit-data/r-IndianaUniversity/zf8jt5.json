    "postText": "Hey, so I applied to Indiana university October First. Since then they have asked to see my 7th semester grades. I have at the moment a 3.9 gpa and a 3.7 unweighted. I also explained my 2.9 gpa in my essay. (Had a 2 gpa) freshman year. Is my decision going to stem directly from this semester of grades? Would them asking to see my semesters grades be a good sign for me? Does this mean I am deferred? Sorry I know a bunch of questions. Thank you!",

I would guess you\u2019re on the fence right now in terms of admission, but your current semester gpa will reflect well on you so there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019ll push you over the edge. Just my guess though, I don\u2019t really know much about how they do admissions.",

    "postText": "I will be joining Iu this fall as a freshman, and I plan on buying a new laptop over the summer. I have used a MacBook over the last 4 years for hs, and I am very comfortable with it. Would a software like parallels on a new m powered MacBook work the same as a windows laptop for a class like k201",

They're cheaper, easier to troubleshoot and upgrade, cooperate better with IU's cloud apps and storage and will run any application you'll need. I wouldn't even recommend a Mac for graphics anymore. The PCs recommended here will all be great.",

    "postText": "Hi all! I have been accepted into an REU at IU for this summer, so I will be staying on campus for 10 weeks. I live about 11 hours away from Bloomington and am wondering if it will be worth it to drive.\n\nAll transportation costs are covered, as well as the dorm room and funds for meals. \n\nIs it easy to get around Bloomington without a car? If you live on campus, how often do you find yourself needing to leave the campus?\n\nI\u2019m trying to decide if I want to drive there or fly. Thank you in advance!",

I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ll get a crimson card, but transportation on the campus busses and Bloomington transit busses is free for students. That being said, if you can swing it, I\u2019d probably bring the car. There\u2019s a lot of cool stuff around Bloomington in the summer (lake Monroe, brown county state park, etc.) that you\u2019ll need and possibly want a car for. :)",

However, as soon as you leave campus town and try to go anywhere else, then you will want a vehicle. Our bus system has been inconsistent at best over the past few years. It's gotten a bit better in the last few months, but with summer hours I wouldn't want to be here without access to a vehicle.",

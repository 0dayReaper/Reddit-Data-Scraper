Interested in joining a business frat (specifically AKPSI) for a mix of business and professional.\n\nJust some questions:\n\nWhat was the time commitment? How is the pledge process? Hazing? Is it a safe and inclusive environment in which someone can thrive and benefit themselves career-wise?\n\nThanks.",

If you answered no to either or both of these questions and still want to get into a business frat: good fuckin luck lmao \n\n In all seriousness you don't have to worry too  much about joining a frat they're not super worth it unless you're really hell bent on it.  I don't know too much about the real In's- and- out's but everything I've heard from everyone I know has just been that it's a giant racket",

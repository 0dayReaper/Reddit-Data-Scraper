    "postText": "so i got rejected from UMass, and now IU is clearly my top choice as of right now. one of the things i really liked about UMass is that they had a really cool indie scene and it would have been easy for me to get gigs if i started a band up with friends. Does IU have something like this? are there any organizations or student clubs that do anything of the same nature? \n\ni\u2019m sure there is but i haven\u2019t found anything online so let me know\u2019",

My friend also had no issues starting a band but so far they haven\u2019t started trying to book shows so I can\u2019t speak to that. But I\u2019m also just an indie music enjoyer and not in the scene so I\u2019m not very knowledgeable beyond that level",

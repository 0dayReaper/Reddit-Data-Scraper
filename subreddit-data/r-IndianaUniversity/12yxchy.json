    "postText": "Hey y'all! I graduated with my undergrad from IU in 2021 and am returning this fall for a post-master's degree at the Jacobs School of Music in Opera. I have a pretty generous scholarship right now but am currently looking for a graduate assistantship that is external from my program.\n\nCurrently I serve as a graduate assistant doing admin and student services work for the Center of Academic Success at Louisiana State University. I'm great with any admin work, and specialize in student affairs. \n\nI'm familiar with the GradGrants page but often find you just need to know the right person at the right time for these positions. If anyone knows of anything available I'd be super interested in hearing about it :)",

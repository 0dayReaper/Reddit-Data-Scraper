    "postText": "My overall grade for this course has slowly but surely been dropping. Right now it's a solid 75%. I've had a decent understanding of the coursework, but the weekly quizzes have been steadily killing my grade as I have zero time to study for them, and I usually come to understand the subject we're learning after we've already taken them.\n\nRight now this week's assignment revolves around Informal Proofs, and I'm stumped with the existential claim problems. The professor told us to use the notes he laid out for us, but the example problems feel very different from the problems I actually need to do. And I don't have much time to go to office hours, especially this week, so I have no idea how I'm gonna come to understand these.\n\nHas anyone else taken this course and know any youtube videos I could watch on the subject or something?",

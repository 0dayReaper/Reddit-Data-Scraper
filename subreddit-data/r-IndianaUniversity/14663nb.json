    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman, and my roommate and I just got assigned to Foster.  I'm a little nervous about using the tap water to wash my face, shower, brush my teeth because the water in my state is very different then Indiana's water.  I also have kind of sensitive skin, so I wanted to bring a faucet filter, but my dorm seems to only have communal bathrooms.  Has anyone had any issues with the water causing skin/health issues?",

            "comment": "If you're worried about the water for brushing, you can use bottled water. I also heard the the water has fluoride in it but I'm not really sure about that. On the other hand, I also have sensitive skin and nothing has happened to me when I used the communal showers. I dare say my skin was even better but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

My freshman year I lived in Read and had no issues, but my sophomore year, I moved to Teter and had sensitive, itchy skin all over including my scalp for months. It honestly depends!\n\nIf you can make a faucet filter work in a communal bathroom, go for it. But otherwise, you'll have to tough it out and just take care of yourself the best you can.",

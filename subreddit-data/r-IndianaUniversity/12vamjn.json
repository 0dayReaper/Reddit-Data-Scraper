Even after they shut those buildings down for a year, mold came back in some buildings according to news outlets. Also, bathrooms were not part of the renovations in some of those mold impacted buildings. The bathrooms in McNutt look the same today as when my kid was a freshman there in 2012. I\u2019ve seen pix of mold in buildings not involved in that 2018 crisis. I think they do what they can to address issues as they learn of them. Unlike real estate or traditional landlord rental transactions, universities are not legally obligated to reveal past or current mold/water damage in residential units. Lower level laundry rooms in dorms as shown on student social media can have maintenance issues and malfunctions. Avoiding rooms on those levels would be a wise choice. Being short staffed in maintenance and other support divisions since Covid makes it more of a challenge for some universities to stay on top of things along with budget woes.",

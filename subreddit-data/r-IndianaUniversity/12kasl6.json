    "postText": "As the title implies, I\u2019m a confused freshman coming into as a DA to Kelley this fall. \n\n1. Regarding Finite and Calc, is it still possible to take them through Ivy Tech? Also, I\u2019m not sure if this is possible but I saw a reply to a Reddit post from a long time ago saying that there is a loophole around Finite by taking bio anthropology instead. \n\n2. How many hours a day should I be studying and reviewing content from classes?\n\n3. Is the Kelley curriculum heavily math based for the first 2 years?\n\n4. Is there anything I could do now to prepare myself for success?\n\n5. Are there any other tips for overall success once I am a student?",

            "comment": "1. Yes, that was a rumor\n2. You should be studying/reviewing content based on how many credit hours a class is. 3 credits = 3 hours spent outside of class. 2 credits = 2 hours spent outside of class per week.\n3. I am not in Kelley so I can't answer this but from what I've heard, no\n4. Literally just be yourself. I know you're asking from an academic standpoint, but if you've developed good study habits in high school then you should already be prepared. The social aspect of a big campus is honestly what challenges people the most; you're forced to step outside of your comfort zone. IU has over 40,000 students so it's a great time to experience new cultures, make new friends, and broaden your horizons.",

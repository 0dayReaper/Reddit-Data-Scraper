Your meal plan is attached to it, and once you select a plan during orientation or whatever you\u2019re good. I\u2019m not sure how all of the plans work, but my meal plan has unlimited meal swipes for the \u201call you care to eat\u201d dining halls. \n\nSome places on campus have little convenience stores where you can use what are called \u201cdining dollars\u201d to buy stuff. You can also use them at the Starbucks locations on campus. The amount of dining dollars you get per semester depends on your meal plan. I think I get $50 per semester. Not sure if you can add more, but it doesn\u2019t really make sense to. \n\nThe meal plans also come with a certain amount of \u201cexchanges\u201d per week. These can be used to get a friend without a meal plan into the all you care to eat locations, or get certain items at the convenience store locations. To my knowledge these do not work at Starbucks. I think I get 2 or 3 per week.",

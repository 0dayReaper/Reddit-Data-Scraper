Starting to panic a bit, since I believe it's too late to apply for another year in the dorms. What are my options? How close to campus could I reasonably expect to get this late in?",

The place is super close to campus (5 min walk to law school building, 10 min to IMU). Message me if you're interested and I can send some photos and talk in more detail!",

    "postText": "\nHi guys, \n\nI\u2019m an incoming direct freshman to Kelley this fall, hoping to major in Accounting and Finance. I\u2019m a little confused- at NSO, do we actually register for classes or do we just meet w/ the advisor and they help us select classes (but we have to register on our own later?). Also, I\u2019d rlly appreciate it if someone could look over my schedule. I\u2019m trying to find a decent balance between rigor and easier classes and earn a good GPA. I\u2019m also in Hutton honors if that helps. I\u2019m trying to plan my schedule before NSO. I\u2019ve referenced the degree requirements and iGPS course map but I still need some help and advice on if this is a doable schedule/what classes to take. Thank you so much. \n\n(Note: I already satisfied Eng-W131, Natural Science gen ed, S&amp;H gen ed, and expect to satisfy M119/Calc and Finite M118 over summer)\n\nFall:\n1) Accounting A100  \n\n2) Business Press Honors C106.  \n\n3) ECONB 251 Fundmentals of Econ for Bus1\n\n4) AH 3 credits. 3 CR. (Gender culture society GNDR-G 101?) \n\n5) AH 3 credits.  3 CR (photography?)\n\n\nSpring: \n\n1) Honors Computer in Business K204 \n\n2) Fundmentals of Econ for Bus II. ECON B 252 Should I do this?\n\n3) Management accounting and analysis\u2026. Should I do this? \n\n4) Compass 1  1.5 CR\n\n5) World culture class? 3 credits. FOLK0F 101?\n\n6) Word culture class? 3 credits.  \n\nI want to fit this in somewhere:\nStress Prevention and Management",

            "comment": "Your advisor will help you during NSO, but going in with a rough idea is smart.\n\nYou also can meet with an advisor towards the end of Fall semester to plan Spring semester. Id recommend scheduling that asap once the spring classes are released. You probably wont talk about spring semester before then because they havent released the spring class schedule yet.",

I took Stress Prevention and Management (the web based one), and enjoyed that. It was a pretty low time commitment and it was also I believe an 8 week class. I believe that as long as you are getting all of your required classes done you should be fine. That being said, with managerial accounting, I have heard that most people take financial accounting before managerial.",

Could help with getting things out of the way",

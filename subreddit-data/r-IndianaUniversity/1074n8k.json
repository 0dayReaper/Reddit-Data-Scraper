    "postText": "I go to a college prep school and IU is one of my top choices after I got direct admit to Kelley. A lot of the grads from my school say that a lot of college underclassman classes are easier than the classes we took at my prep school. Just wanted to post here to ask: how difficult is Kelley and its weed-out classes? For the record, I excel in math and stats and have some experience in finance and investment.",

I hear I-Core junior year is tougher, but don\u2019t have direct knowledge about that yet. Some students find \u201cComputers in Business\u201d class tough but my student really enjoyed it.",

            "comment": "I do want to start with a disclaimer that I no longer go to IU and left after my freshman year, but I was ahead on courses and didn\u2019t just take what most freshman do. \n\nKelley was absurdly easy in my experience. A100 and K201 are the cause of most people\u2019s headaches but if you put in the bare minimum amount of effort they\u2019re both a free A. Jamie Seitz is an awful teacher but you have a textbook and only need an 83 on her final to get an A in the course. I went to a very average public high school and my work there was significantly harder. iCore is obviously more difficult but every single college program has challenges in your later years. If you can stay on top of your shit, which I assume you can coming from a prep school, and not go out 5+ nights a week you should do really well without too much effort.",

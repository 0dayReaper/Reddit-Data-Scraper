    "postText": "My daughter is starting IU in Fall and will have a random assigned roommate.  We know that good landlords/good off campus locations book early in the Fall (october-ish?).  We are struggling with whether we should look for a 1 bedroom OR 2 bedroom and hope to meet someone that would be a good roommate for the 2nd year.   Ideally, we would like to find a good place for the remaining years in Bloomington to avoid move in/move out merry go round\n\nWhat have other students done in the Freshman to Sophomore transition?   When do leases start getting signed for the next school year?\n\nThanks!",

However, anything by the stadium is a good, fun, safe, quite (during the week) neighborhood. \n\nMy recommendation is to let you daughter try and figure it out though. \n\nExperiences like that are the additional education that comes from college and the value is incredible. Just touch base with her frequently to keep her on track with deadlines",

I would say fall like october-november is the best time to be looking for and signing leases.",

I\u2019m sure your daughter will make friends fast and quickly, there\u2019s plenty of students and as long as she does at least one kind of extracurricular like a club, she\u2019ll definitely meet and make new friends. Or even from classes. But for sure she should get to know her roommate and make a judgement (should be fairly easy after 2-3 months of living with them), and also make new friends. It shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to find someone to lease with.",

I have had 2 kids go through IU and truthfully I didn't worry about their housing . One pledged and moved in to her sorority the other didn't pledge and found his own housing with roommates in January of freshman year . Lived with them for 2 years .",

            "comment": "Take your meds. Don\u2019t know if IU will let you keep your scholarship. They seem to be very strict about scholarship requirements. If a 3.2 is the minimum, then it has to be at 3.2 exactly. I am a current junior at IU. There is also a student medical center here at IU to help you with medications. Or keep in contact with your current physician who oversees your ADHD medications and request that they make sure you have a supply of medication while you are in university. If you have ADHD and not on meds, you will have a difficult time here at IU. The introduction classes are very difficult as I found out. Students have to work really hard in the intro classes at IU. I suggest you contact the scholarship office regarding your current situation and work out what to do from there.",

If you are on a prescription of stimulants you\u2019ll have to be in contact with your doctor , your doctor to write a script to your Bloomington/IU address pharmacy and you\u2019ll need ID to pick up",

            "comment": "You're fine. The minimum scholarship for HHSP is a 3.0. Just continue to keep your GPA up throughout Freshman year and you'll be good. A good thing to remeber is that the GPA requirement for this scholarship is based on the academic year. So, if your GPA drops to a 2.98 after fall semester you won't lose the scholarhsip as long as your GPA is back to a 3.0 or above after spring semester.\n\nhttps://hudsonandholland.indiana.edu/",

The cutoff to be accepted is a 3.2, though I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019d revoke an acceptance you already got.\n\nSource: https://hudsonhollandscholars.indiana.edu/prospective-scholars/apply/eligibility/index.html",

I apologized as menially as I could, begged him for whatever I could do to make it up, and would like to accept any consequences. But four days have passed, I haven\u2019t received a reply from him. I was wondering whether he saw my email or whether he saw it but chose to ignore it. What would you do in this situation? Should I send him another email or come to his office hour?",

I've had professors wait practically a week before giving a reply to something I had to ask.\n\nI'd suggest waiting a couple more days, then consider asking him in person. If he has AIs, maybe try to find and ask them how he usually handles missed exams.",

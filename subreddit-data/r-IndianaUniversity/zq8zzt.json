    "postText": "Hi I\u2019m a possible student next year and i was wondering if there\u2019s a diverse group of students at IU? Not only demographics wise but interest wise. I really don\u2019t enjoy the company of frat/sorority types. Are there plenty of more offbeat people who are into more worldly/cultural stuff and can actually keep a good conversation?? also would you recommend LLCs? thank you!",

I\u2019ve had trouble meeting ppl even though I\u2019m in an LLC. Met and befriended people but I don\u2019t really have a \u201cgroup\u201d I hang with. I\u2019ve also had trouble meeting people of my race.\n\nTbh, you can\u2019t know till you get here. Some people will meet others in a week and immediately form a close friend group with them. Others will be like me and not fully click with anyone for a while, or possibly not at all. You\u2019ll just have to see.",

I believe theres a separate application to get admitted. But also Bloomington has always been an alternative hub w a cool indie music scene in the midwest. You'll love it!",

None of my friends party but we have plenty to do each weekend and plenty of people to hang out with. With Greek life it\u2019s worth noting you will run into it frequently but personally, I think it keeps things interesting and it doesn\u2019t interrupt my thing. I live in an LLC and I literally can\u2019t recommend it more. I\u2019ve meant majority of my friends on my floor.",

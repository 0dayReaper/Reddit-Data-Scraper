If you\u2019re truly smart enough to keep up at an Ivy League school you\u2019ll be able to balance school work and fun. I don\u2019t know about Dyson specifically, but Cornell is a fabulous school. Great academics, great social life and Greek programs, great network. Certainly a little better than Kelley\u2019s. And yes, I would say there is a difference. When people apply to competitive jobs, unless you have a killer resume, the resumes that are selected generally are either people who know a recruiter, or people who go to target schools like Cornell, MIT, Harvard, etc. At the end of the day, it\u2019s up to you. Costs, time away from family, and a lot of other stuff is stuff only you know and can consider.",

Half of your success is going to be your own hustle; the other half will be being in the right place at the right time.\n\nSigned as someone who went to IU and was later accepted to both Columbia and Harvard. Go crush it either way.",

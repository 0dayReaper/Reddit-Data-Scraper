    "postText": "(Already posted in the Bloomington subreddit, but I thought I\u2019d ask here too)\n\nI\u2019m helping an international student find an apartment for next semester. I recommended the apartment complex I\u2019ll be staying at in the fall. She\u2019s in the process of finding a place through them. They told her \u201cRenters insurance is required to have on all the apartments and homes. The only requirement is at least 100,000 in personal liability coverage\u201d. \n\nThe thing is, they never asked me or my roommate to get renter\u2019s insurance. My sister lives at the same complex and I don\u2019t think they asked her to get insurance either. Does this seem fishy to you? Is it because she\u2019s an international student?",

            "comment": "Renters insurance is often required in buildings, regardless of your nationality. It has been required by several of my landlords both in Bloomington and later in life. While odd they didn't require it of you, there are likely a lot of leasing agents and rather than assume mal intent I would think they are disorganized. \n\nAfaik the building does not make any money on your friend getting renters insurance... Only the insurance company is getting paid. It's also really affordable and great to have in the event of a fire or theft. For me renters insurance is a no brainer and would be the smart thing to do regardless of where they rent.",

If you move and cancel they will refund the months you haven't utilized. There are also cheaper options- I have a couple high value items specifically insured in there that makes it cost a little more. Good luck!",

Honestly, the most likely reason is human error. The person who did your lease might have forgotten, or it might be a newer policy. It\u2019s possible that they\u2019re doing it because the person you\u2019re helping is international, but that wouldn\u2019t be my first thought.",

Your own personal goods may not be worth much but it covers you if an accident occurs like fire, water overflow, etc. that damages apartment.  The landlord\u2018s insurance WILL go after the tenant so insurance is a good idea.\n\nAlso, if it is required than it will be in your lease.  I work for a property management company in Ohio and we require it and verify all tenants have insurance so not an unusual standard.",

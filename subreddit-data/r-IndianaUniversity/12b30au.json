They\u2019re all part of the same program application process that involves u taking a class, etc and all can place u in a solid job in IB. If you actually have what it takes to break in u will get into one of the three (assuming ur starting from scratch as a freshmen and not a junior since u said they don\u2019t counts associates). And I\u2019ll be going to a mid tier bulge bracket (think Bank of America, Citi, Barclays)",

Like I said, the appeal may have to be for next year as this event hasn\u2019t \u201cburdened \u201c your family expenses yet. I truly feel for you. I know and I tell my girls that we are fortunate. We are not rich by any means, but this gift of education that we have given them is not to be taken lightly. My daughter is in Kelley too. There are some courses that you may be able to take at local campuses that may be less expensive. Just make sure you speak with a counselor first. My daughter took finite at ivy tech and will be taking another class as well. These are less expensive than IU. Perhaps you can look into taking some non Kelley classes to offset the cost? Look into all of the scholarships on their site. You may fit the criteria of one or more.",

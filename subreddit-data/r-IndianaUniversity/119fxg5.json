    "postText": "I\u2019ve lived at the same apartment complex for 2 years now and my first year here not once was I cited even when I forgot to put my parking pass up or had my car facing forward for months. Now, in the span of less than 2 months I\u2019ve been cited for not having my pass up (luckily got that appealed) and now for \u201cnot having my license plate facing the lane\u201d. I haven\u2019t checked my actual ticket, but if it\u2019s the same officer as last, me thinks they have a hall monitor personality. Has anyone else experienced something similar?",

So that is \u2018stricter.\u2019\n\nNo parking pass on display and parking with the front of your car facing the drive lane are both ticketable offenses by their current policies, so unfortunately if you are doing those things they are within rights to write a ticket. But you might get lucky with an appeal on occasion.",

Not parking with your license plate facing the lane is going to be the same as not displaying your pass since the plate IS going to be your pass once the move to full LPR is done. They're enforcing this now so that it's not a surprise to anyone later, and they're being much more lenient about it right now. If your tag was properly displayed, appeal the ticket and say you'll make sure to keep this stuff in mind going forward, and you can probably get it approved. Just don't be an asshole about it or they'll make you pay the fine.",

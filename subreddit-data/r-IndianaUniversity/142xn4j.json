The common areas, kitchens, and study rooms are super nice, which does not go for all of the dorms., Rooms themselves aren't huge but are solid size for a double. Bathrooms are not private but not as communal as the other dorms and they are much cleaner and nicer. Good proximity to Kelley, tailgate fields/stadiums, and F bus which can take you all the way to 3rd street. It is a bit far to classes near 3rd street or to go downtown but if you have a car or use the busses, that is not an issue. Easily a top 3 dorm on campus so consider yourself lucky.",

I think you can even dim the lights, lol. \n\nThe only issue I have heard is that if you\u2019re over 6 foot (friend was 6\u20193) you might feel a little cramped in the showers, but otherwise holy hell you got a nice pick! A little far from classes (a lot of freshman kelley classes are in Ballantine, a far walk away) but the bus system (when on time) can get you where you need to go.",

Close to the stadium and tailgate fields for game days, close to a dining hall, starbucks, and c store. Only complaints I have are the elevators are slow, there aren\u2019t enough stair cases, and the building gets absurdly trashed for some reason every year.",

            "comment": "Eiganmann is like it\u2019s own little community. If you\u2019re friendly with people on your floor, you can hook yourself up quite nicely. The single rooms are pretty nice, and you get one hell of a view if you\u2019re on the upper floors. The elevator is also spacious, meaning that if you bring a bike, you can wheel it straight to your room if the elevator isnt full of people (which is great because bikes are frequently stolen on campus).\n\nOnly thing I will say that sucks about eigy is that during the fall semester there was a massive issue with students pulling the fire alarm at night, which means that if you\u2019re on the upper floors, you have to go down an insane amount of stairs to get to the exit. This happened much less during the spring semester, however I\u2019ve had friends complain often about how annoying it was.",

Rooms are rlly big which makes up for being kinda far from everything else on campus, but the E bus stop is right outside. Nearest dining hall is wright which is a 7 min walk and forest which is 15 mins. Loved how it was close to Jimmy johns and pizza X, that always came in clutch as drunk food lmao. Fire alarms were often during first semester so we just stopped going out for them. Walls are thin which sucked. AC constantly went out too.",

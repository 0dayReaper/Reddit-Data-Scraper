    "postText": "Just got into IUB Kelley. I was wondering how difficult the classes are. My friend who goes to Haas said that I'd have to take BUSSY 30(Coloring inside the lines) and Math40 (Elementary addition and subtraction) only in graduate school. But I've heard that Kelley has you take it literally in 3rd yr??? WTF idk if I'm smart enough to do that. I have a 4.83 GPA and a 1620 SAT and 5's on AP Physics C, AP Calc BC, AP Chem and AP CSA btw. please advise.",

            "comment": "&gt; With fears around their safety amplified, Asian American students who spoke to NBC News said they\u2019ve been disappointed in the response from both those outside the Asian community and the school administration, who made their first statements around the attack two days afterward. \n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s very tiring for the Asian community to be doing all the work,\u201d Audrey Lee, a senior, said. \u201cI think a lot of Asian Americans internalize the feeling that if they do kind of speak out, when these situations happen, they\u2019re going to be viewed as crazy or overreacting.\u201d \n&gt; \n&gt; Mara Yankey, senior media relations consultant for Indiana University, responded in an email that the victim\u2019s request for privacy \u201climits what IU or other local officials can say publicly.\u201d \n\n...\n\n&gt; Zhang, a sophomore and resident adviser for the school\u2019s Asian American Thematic Community, said he isn\u2019t confident that those outside the Asian community are all aware of the violent attack. And it\u2019s this lack of awareness, the students say, that shows the administration could be doing more to promote education and solidarity around Asian American issues not only to the student body, but also to the surrounding community.\n\n...\n\n&gt; They praised the university\u2019s Asian Culture Center for releasing a statement shortly after the attack and organizing a night of open discussion last week, inviting the campus community members to talk about their emotions and write letters to the victim. And many took it upon themselves to offer rides to those who felt unsafe and check in on their friends\u2019 emotional and mental health.",

Instead, the report says, he was fired in September 2021 when three campus police officers showed up at his Wisconsin home, 150 miles from the Gary campus, and delivered a trespass notice threatening arrest if he entered university property.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cAfter he made a telephone call that evening to the office of a colleague in Bloomington [Indiana], police officers notified him that his call had violated the trespass notice,\u201d the report says.\n&gt; \n&gt; The month before all this, the university had suspended McPhail from teaching and cut his salary by 75 percent after giving him a poor teaching evaluation, the AAUP wrote.\n\n...\n\n&gt; \u201cMany of the anonymous interviewees discussed the tense racial climate on campus and named numerous faculty members and administrators of color who had left IUN or were \u2018driven out,\u2019\u201d the report says.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cFighting hostile work environments while serving as \u2018tokens\u2019 on administrative \u2018leadership cabinets\u2019 without any ability to effect meaningful change would understandably take a deep toll on faculty members of color,\u201d it says.\n&gt; \n&gt; In an accompanying news release, the AAUP says a committee will now consider recommending to AAUP\u2019s governing council placing IUN on the list of censured administrations.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cPlacement on that list informs the academic community and the public at large that conditions for academic freedom and tenure at the institution are unsound,\u201d the AAUP says.",

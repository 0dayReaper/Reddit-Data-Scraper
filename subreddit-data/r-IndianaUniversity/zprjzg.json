It is downtown, so you would be able to park your car when you arrive and get pretty much everywhere on foot while you are here\u2026 a great way to experience what your life might be like as a student here. \n\nI live off campus, but stayed at this hotel once when our plumbing needed work. It was clean and convenient. There\u2019s a bar and I believe a rooftop area to socialize, though it is getting colder here and as a fellow southerner, I wouldn\u2019t want to be drinking on the roof in this weather \ud83d\ude0e",

There are also several hotels downtown within a 5-10 minute walk to campus\u2026just look up hotels in Bloomington and look for the ones closest the word \u201cBloomington\u201d on the map.  It\u2019s a small town and campus is centrally located, so you can drive to campus from any side of town within 10 minutes.",

            "comment": "I was an economics graduate in 2012.  \n\n**Class size** varied depending on the course quite a bit.  Introductory classes (which you'll be taking almost regardless of major) were 200-300 people.  After that, much smaller (probably 30-50 for the majority of the classes).  You can go to:\n\n[https://sisjee.iu.edu/sisigps-prd/web/igps/course/search/](https://sisjee.iu.edu/sisigps-prd/web/igps/course/search/)\n\nand kind of look around the classes to get a feel for their class size.  For example, E321, Intermediate Microeconomic Theory has a class size of 45.  E341, Economics of Labor Markets, has a class size of 30.  \n\n**Alumni network?**  I haven't talked to anybody since I graduated but occasionally get stuff in the mail like a newsletter. \n\n**Quality?** It's hard to say.  So much of life is what you put into it.  They definitely have the faculty and courses that can help you become an economist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Personal opinion:** The economics major is great for those who want to be an economist and plan to pursue graduate school.  If this is your objective, you should be a double major (grab math or computer science or something similar).  If this is not your objective, there are better options at IU that are somewhat similar: \n\n1. Kelley School of Business (tons of majors here).  A degree from Kelley is the best degree the school offers if your end goal is to make money.\n2. SPEA (School of Public and Environmental Affairs).  Several degrees here.  Top rated program.\n3. Luddy (SICE, School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering).  \n\nYou're a freshman looking for advice on Reddit.  This indicates to me that you're a little unsure of what you want.  Continue to explore your options.  No need to commit to anything, but you want to keep your options available, so explore some of what I've mentioned (if you want, or other programs) and take these ideas to an advisor.",

The whole system can be complicated and awkward to navigate. My problems have come more from getting my disabilities established rather than actually dealing with my representative. \n\nMy meetings have been you talk about your condition as is listed on your documentation. They ask questions about your condition and if you want to clarify or highlight anything this is when you should. Then walk you through an orientation of your academic accomodations and after every meeting you get an email of what you discussed during the meeting.\n\nHope this helps",

Honestly, it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal and it wasn\u2019t all that invasive. They just asked how I\u2019d pay, what I\u2019d do in certain situations, etc.",

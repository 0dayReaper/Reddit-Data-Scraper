    "postText": "I\u2019m in a comp sci course, and the average midterm score was really bad (im sure some of you are in the same course and know what I\u2019m talking about) as there was a severe lack of time given to complete the exam. \n\nThe professor gave out a makeup exam, which I took because my grade was amongst all the other poor scores (grade dropped from an A to a C-). The only issue was that we still lacked a decent amount of time to complete it, and this time we\u2019d receive no partial credit.\n\nI was worried at first, but I was able to get all the questions completed, and all of my code passed the examples laid out for us. I thought I\u2019d get a perfect score, so naturally, I was surprised when I got a C-. My grade has risen to a B, but that\u2019s still far from the A I once had.\n\nI asked my grader if there could be an reevaluation, but they said two of my answers failed to pass two test case respectively, even though they passed the examples given to us, and literally every other test input I could think of. The grader wasn\u2019t sure if they could tell me the inputs used in the failed test case, so I don\u2019t even know what I did wrong or what caused the errors. Since there was no partial credit, I lost all points on these problems even though, again, they passed the examples given in the actual midterm makeup PDF without fail. Also, I think the makeup was graded using our course\u2019s autograder, which is notoriously buggy, so honestly I\u2019m still fairly sure I did the code correctly.\n\nPer my grader\u2019s recommendation, I emailed the professor to see if he could tell me the inputs that my code supposedly failed, so I could test them manually myself to see if I really did have an error, but he hasn\u2019t responded.\n\nShould I meet with my professor after a lecture and ask again, or should I just give it up and accept the C-? Is this something I should bring up to my advisor? I\u2019m really not sure what to do, as I don\u2019t want to risk annoying the professor, but I\u2019m sure I should have received an A on that exam. Plus if we lack time to complete the Final, I\u2019m not sure my grade will be able to take another massive hit even if I manage to drag it back up to an A.",

I don't think too many professors would be annoyed unless you're wrong, won't accept it, and start begging for a grade.\n\nIt may be worth discussing with your advisor if the professor is a jerk to you in order to determine next steps, but nothing you've posted here indicates the professor would be like that at all.  In fact, it sounds like the opposite as he even gave out a make-up exam.",

Probably could've gotten a B at least if that wasn't the case. Hopefully they don't use it for the Final.\n\nBut yeah, ig I'll have to get used to this kind of thing. My grade's a B like I said, and I still have time to drag it back up to an A if I play my cards right.",

I can still apply to the 4+1 graduate program which I\u2019m considering if I want to suffer one more year. You\u2019ll b fine. There are plenty of classes that are free As if you just do the work.",

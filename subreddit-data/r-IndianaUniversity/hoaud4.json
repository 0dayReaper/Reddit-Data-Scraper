Plumbing is easier now than it used to be thanks to pex. \n\nAgreed though. College definitely isn't the right move for everyone and the process is set up so that 18 year olds who have no idea what they want to do with their life start making very expensive decisions as soon as they get on campus. You change your major a few times and all of the sudden you're staying an extra semester or an extra year getting a bio degree that is hard to find a job in. Some degrees flat out aren't worth the cost.",

    "postText": "Well, students, Brother Jed and Sister Cindy have received a 1 year ban from IU after the cops were called to campus today. He claims that a student tried to grab at his camera and he was only defending himself by pushing the student away. I'll miss seeing him on my afternoon strolls through campus. I mean, who else is going to tell me that I'm going to Hell for enjoying some w\\*\\*d every once in a while?   \n\nI'll leave you with the words of the wise Sister Cindy when I asked if premarital sex was still a sin if I kept my eyes closed. \"Yes.\"",

Govt can impose more limits here, but must generally be viewpoint neutral.\n\n- non-public fora, e.g. your professor's office, your dorm room, classrooms (except those that might have been designated as public public fora as above).\n\nIU (my beloved alma mater for undergrad and graduate degrees) has no legal right to exclude the reprehensible Brother Jed.

The city only has easement over a few of them so only those count as public right of ways for purposes of 1A laws and the tresspass warning. There is nothing stopping Smock from finding one of those areas almost inches away from Campus and continuing to do his \"thing\". The deals you mentioned above are not really a thing as far as criminal trespass goes. It is rarely ever a felony so there aren't usually bargaining deals, they either are fined and jailed or just fined.   \nNo one's civil liberties are being violated here. I recognize that you are not a fan of \"Jed\" as you have repeated that a few times now, but if we allow ourselves to entertain Smock's arrogant legal defenses, that's barely any better.",

It is not as cut and dry as you seem to think, and misconceptions like this are common and the reason many 1Ls have a hard time with Conlaw, something you have clearly never taken.   \nYour continued mission to try and brigade the post with Conlaw arguments is missing the forest for the trees, and I will point back to what I said above: he was a given a trespass warning (which is not a sentence under law lol), IU trespassed him from land they absolutely control (Read title 21). 1A doesn't trump trespassing laws, and if he comes back (It's a free country right) he will be arrested for criminal trespass, not for speaking, just as today he was warned because there was reasonable suspicion he committed a crime, which is all you need under Section 35.  \nThere is a fantastic and nationally ranked Law School on IU's campus, I suggest you ask them what they think of your view of this simple tresspass warning. You may be surprised to find they will stop you at the word \"creation\" or \"creature\"  \nGood talking to ya",

So you will just want to select that you want the Southeast neighborhood and you will likely end up in forest, Read, Spruce, or Willkie (all of which are really not bad)",

If you call either dorm's center desk they can also typically give you room dimension details and such and typically have a hand-out they can email you with more info as well. Best of luck!",

            "comment": "&gt; Several faculty leaders from Indiana University campuses wrote a letter opposing proposed state abortion legislation and defending a colleague. An IU official called it a \u201cpolicy violation,\u201d a new report reveals.\n\n...\n\n&gt; \"It seems to me this is a case where they\u2019re speaking out of concern on an issue of both public and institutional significance,\u201d he said. \u201cJust in general this is an unwelcome trend of wanting to constrain faculty members\u2019 remarks on controversial public matters.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Joshua T. Bleisch, a lawyer with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression\u2019s Faculty Legal Defense Fund, said, \u201cIt\u2019s highly unusual that faculty speech on these issues, even where they\u2019re using their titles or university email, would be mistaken for \u2018university speech.\u2019 But administrators\u2019 actions here creating ambiguity on that point and adding threats of discipline create a chilling effect on faculty speech.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cIU won\u2019t lose their tax-exempt status if faculty exercise their First Amendment rights,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOn the other hand, they do open themselves up to legal liability when they suggest faculty may be punished for speaking out on political issues of the day.\u201d",

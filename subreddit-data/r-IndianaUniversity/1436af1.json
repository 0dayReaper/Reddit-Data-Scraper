I am pretty happy with this given the information I know, but I was wondering if anyone more experienced at IU could give me some more information? I mainly want to know the setup of the singles. How many singles share a bathroom/living area? Are there multiple types of Briscoe singles?",

You will either be a single connected to another single room by a bathroom that you share with that 1 other person, or a single connected to a double with a bathroom that you share with those 2 people. There are no living areas connected to single rooms, only the doubles connected to doubles have living rooms.",

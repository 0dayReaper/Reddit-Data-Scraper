    "postText": "Throughout undergrad, I pursued a BA in Media and a BA in Theatre. Due to a series of scheduling mishaps, I ended up graduating in May of 2021 with only my Media BA, since I needed one more tech class to finish my Theatre BA. Would there be any way as an alumni that I could take one more semester and finish my Theatre BA since I have met all other requirements? I scheduled an advising appointment but would like to know if they\u2019re just gonna laugh in my face. Thanks!",

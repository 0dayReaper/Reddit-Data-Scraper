There was one guy who would rarely emerge from the room and when he did, it was basically to throw away an insane number of plastic water bottles.    \nOf course your mileage may vary and you may have a very social floor but the self-selection bias and layout is kinda stacked against that. There are also some obvious pros to having a single at times, just know that you will have to seek out social groups, especially during welcome week.      \nAnd yes there are 'bars' on the windows in the stairwells and it was the \"Covid jail\" dorm so there are a bunch of IDS articles in which people describe it as a prison, but 1) Those people clearly have never seen a prison and 2) it's still better than the conditions at Wright",

As someone who started with a roommate and then moved to a single, I think I would have enjoyed my time and not transferred possibly if I had a single from the start. So you\u2019re being smart choosing that option. Most students at IU that I met were not at all nice to me, but I enjoyed my second semester much more bc I had my own space away from any of them.",

Plus, you\u2019re really close to the Gym which is also a good activity to ask others to join you for (yoga or cycling classes !). You\u2019re nearish to the middle of campus which is always a plus and close to 3 good dining halls (Wright, Library, and Forest). Depending on where your room is placed you might have minimal natural light during the day but you have brick walls so you can get a bunch of decor to hang up without fear of messing up the walls. While the room is a bit smaller than others it is 100% yours and you\u2019ll have full control over it! Try and leave your door open as much as possible when you\u2019re in during welcome week to help with the first week awkwards. Good luck!",

There were way more than that at bid day, so I\u2019m not sure what you mean. \nWould you really want to force a house to take you because of a petition? \nAlabamas system is no joke . I would be careful what you wish for there. \nDid you try cob? You can also try again next year . You said you dropped out, why? If you stayed thru the whole process you would have been given 2 bids at the end and finally a house. Greek life is not the end all be all. Iu is huge and you can find your people .",

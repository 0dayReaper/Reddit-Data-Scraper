            "comment": "&gt; Indiana University recently announced it is using federal grants to help address the shortage of mental health professionals in schools. More than $10 million in grants recently awarded to the university will be used to help train and hire mental health staff in six schools around the state.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of that $10 million, $5.7 million will be used to increase the number of social workers in the Metropolitan School District of Pike Township, Lafayette School Corporation and Tippecanoe School Corporation by offering staff online classes for school social work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another $4.4 million will be used to partner IU campuses in Kokomo, South Bend and Richmond with the school corporations in those respective communities. Those partnerships will address a shortage of school psychologists by promoting a new education specialist program offered through IU.",

I have taught, written, and litigated about academic freedom. I am not exactly on the fringes of the University. Although they are in no way involved in my work on the presidential search and I do not speak for them, I am currently the co-chair of the Bloomington Faculty Council\u2019s Faculty Affairs Committee, an elected member of my law school\u2019s Policy Committee, and a member of the IU Alumni Association\u2019s Executive Council. I would not do anything to maliciously harm the institution to which I\u2019ve devoted most of my life. But it is not immune from scrutiny.",

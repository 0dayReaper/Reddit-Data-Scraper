            "comment": "Question 1: Take fully asynch- trust me. But don't take both at once, it will be a lot of work. Take one over the summer and one during the school year (its only 8 weeks)\n\nQuestion 2: This is what mine was like\n\nFirst Sem: K201, Compass, B251, A&amp;H Course, S&amp;H Course (100% asynch)\n\nSecond Sem: A100, C204, W131, A&amp;H Course, Science gen ed (100% asynch), Ivy Tech Finite\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI easily couldve taken an extra class each semester. I'd recommend taking Compass 2 second sem because it's super easy. Take b251 first sem because you can take G202 or B252 second semester (b251 is a prereq). There are a lot of sophomore year classes. Try to get at least 1-2 out of the way by taking them freshman year. It will give you room in your sophomore year to start taking some major courses",

I got a lot of the IUB campus requirements completed (A&amp;H/WC credits). But you could also take more Icore pre-reqs. You have a lot of choice building the schedule you want. \n\n&gt;Would it be recommended to take a live lecture based version or the fully asynchronous course?\n\nI've had an ivy tech professor (Calculus) tell me that the in person/virtual lectures typically are a little harder, because you do not get full calculator usage like the online version. However, I have not verified this by course.",

            "comment": "I think you\u2019ll find that getting a job is about the opportunities you take advantage of while a student, the confidence you gain, and how hard you work (and how lucky you are). If you go to Luddy and coast, you may find the best job you can get right after graduation is one you don\u2019t really want. Same would be true at the best school. And if you\u2019re outstanding, you\u2019ll have no trouble at all. \n\nI think \u201cwill I get a job\u201d is the wrong question. Yeah you\u2019ll get a job, but if you want a really good job, make sure to do the things that position you for it while you\u2019re here.",

            "comment": "Direct admit into Luddy that graduated in 2018 with a CS degree. Minor in security informatics. I chose to pursue cybersecurity. Received internship and employment offers from the NCAA, Kratos Defense, Booz Allen Hamilton, Blue Pillar, Blue Horseshoe, Oracle, Appirio, Accenture and others. IU is often ranked in the top 50 universities for comp sci so there are plenty of companies willing to hire IU CS grads. None of my friends or classmates that I know of had trouble landing a job.\n\nI believe Luddy reports ~90% of grads are employed or enrolled in grad school within 6 months. \n\nCheck out this site for post-grad data including a list of employers, average starting salary, etc. https://luddy.indiana.edu/career-services/hiring-data-report.html",

You can definitely get into a great career after graduating from Luddy but you have to put in the work. Don\u2019t listen to the people that say GPA doesn\u2019t matter. No one was interested in having me for an internship when my GPA was below a 3.0.",

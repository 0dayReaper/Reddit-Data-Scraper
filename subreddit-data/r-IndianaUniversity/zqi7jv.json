    "postText": "I applied to IU a while ago, and have gotten accepted to IU and direct admitted to the College of Arts &amp; Sciences. However, I haven't heard back from the Hutton Honors College yet (4.2 GPA, 1270 SAT, decently heavy courseload, several extracurriculars). Is it safe to assume I haven't gotten in, and if so, should I petition for admission?",

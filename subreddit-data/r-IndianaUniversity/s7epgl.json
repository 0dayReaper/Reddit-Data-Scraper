We don't do cold/flu/runny nose/runny butt)  \nOn the 10th I worked for 8 hours next to a quietly symptomatic person and we saw patients all day.   \nOn the afternoon of the 12th I was informed by the person that they had tested positive for covid.  \nOn the morning of the 13th I offered to call all the patients that had been exposed. I was told by my boss that I was not allowed to. I was told to trust contact tracing.  \nToday the person returned to work and reported that no one from contact tracing had ever called. I sit next to this person all day every day, contact tracing never contacted me. Two patients in for follow-ups from the 10th confirmed; they were never contacted by contact tracing...and one of them works in a nursing home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis is not good.",

I got an email saying I am past the 5 day isolation period and they apologized for not reaching out because they are 'experiencing an increased volume of covid-19 cases'.",

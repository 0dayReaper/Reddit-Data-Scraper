Unfortunately if you're starting school in the fall 2023 there's probably not a wealth of housing options here as most places start renting for the following year in October or so the year prior; I expect anywhere I recommend will be unlikely to have availability. I would look into calling ew rental companies in town to see what houses they have available. There's not really rough parts of town or anywhere unsafe.",

Millennium is a *bit* cheaper, has the same floor plans and is just around the corner. \n\nBloom was very quiet and in a more secluded area. It was nice to be away from the busyness of campus/downtown. There is also a free shuttle that runs to and from campus. I lived in a 2BR/2BA with a roommate and our rent was 1115 if I recall.",

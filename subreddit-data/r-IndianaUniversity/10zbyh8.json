It also says admitted students will have until April 15th to accept.\n\nPerhaps some additional helpful context? I applied for a PhD in CS or related areas to 8 different programs \u2014 none were IU though, I went there for undergrad. They all had similar application deadlines (Dec 15ish). I\u2019ve heard back from 1 of 8, and mostly they all said mid-February to mid-March.",

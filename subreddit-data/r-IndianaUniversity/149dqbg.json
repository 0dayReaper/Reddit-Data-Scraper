    "postText": "I will be a freshman at Kelley in the fall and with that will have to take Finite Math. I\u2019ve been hearing the murmurs that the class is dreadful at IUB and most recommend taking it at Ivy Tech online. Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t able to do it over the summer because of scheduling and such, but I was wondering if a) Ivy Tech offers this course during the spring/fall semester as an alternative and b) IUB will take the transfer credit for the classes not offered in the summer. Thanks!",

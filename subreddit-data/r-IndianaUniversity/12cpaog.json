    "postText": "Hey, I'm a prospective student that is visiting IU tomorrow and wanted to know if there is anything specific I should ask or keep a look out for. I live in NJ, so my other main option is Rutger's Business School which is decent cheaper. However, I've heard of the opportunities Kelley has and wanted to give it a shot. When committing, was there anything that Kelley or IU, in general, offered that really drew you to it or anything that set it apart from other colleges? Also, I believe I'm going to be meeting with an AO, are there any questions I should ask other than the ordinary? Thanks.",

            "comment": "As far as I know, IU is in the red when it comes to financials. Until the installation of its own COVID testing lab, IU was paying for each individual mitigation test (a price of 85 dollars) for a population of 15000 students. And this was every week; 2.1 million dollars spent on COVID testing alone, more so than any other university.\n\nSome of you might say they were overaggressive in their mitigation policies, and that they should've spent less. Less testing would mean increasing the chances of a case going undetected and thus increasing the chances of an outbreak. An outbreak in a city as precariously situated as Bloomington will have devastating effects. Over a third of the city lives in poverty, a large portion of which is homeless. The business that we visit so often are extremely dependent on us. If the school shuts down, then Bloomington falls with it.",

I know they have to pay staff, etc. but it really doesn\u2019t add up. Next year I will definitely be forgoing a meal plan and eating wherever I want for the same price.",

Just curious, as I was working through the first half of the year during COVID and was paid a standard weekly wage whether I was able to come to work or not, and essential employee pay (time and a half) for the time I had to work on-campus at IU. If Purdue didn't offer any essential employee pay during that time, maybe the bonuses and pay raises are their response to that.",

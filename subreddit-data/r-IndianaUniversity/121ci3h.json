You don\u2019t really have the luxury like other students to take breaks and you have to be really proactive in your learning. Surround yourself with like minded people and get to know your professors well through office hours. The great thing about standard admission is it forces you to be a good student. Good luck!",

If you have a direct admit to UIUC you will still need to maintain a B average or above to succeed in your major meaning the same study and life skills required.\n\nMake your best choice based on knowledge of yourself and a true idea of what you are willing to do to succeed in college.",

            "comment": "I'm including the second link below because the OP doesn't pass the smell test for me (i.e. it's reading as very biased). I don't know enough about Al-Arian's history to confirm or contradict the content of the writeup. I'd be interested if anyone here has more information.\n\nThe event: **Symposium on the Global War on Terrorism and its Impact on Muslim Charitable Institutions**, https://twitter.com/MLFA/status/1600936086921961472?s=20&amp;t=FWcsMQp_ElU9zDKwybXGKQ\n\n____________\n\n&gt; The Investigative Project on Terrorism (IPT) reported on the panel discussion Dec. 20, detailing Al-Arian's prominent history of PIJ involvement and his antisemitic speech, prompting readers to complain to IU President Pamela Whitten. Amir Pasic, dean of the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, wrote back to apologize.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Though he had been recommended to those developing this session due to his academic work and recent efforts organizing a global conference on Islamophobia,\" Pasic wrote, \"we failed in our due diligence to consider his past comments and actions prior to extending an invitation to him. As a result, we have further strengthened our protocols.\"\n\n_____________\n\n[Exclusive interview: Sami Al-Arian, professor who defeated controversial terrorism charges, is deported from U.S.](https://theintercept.com/2015/02/05/sami-al-arian-charged-terrorism-never-convicted-deported-today-u-s/)\n\n&gt; In 2003, Sami Al-Arian was a professor at the University of South Florida, a legal resident of the U.S. since 1975, and one of the most prominent Palestinian civil rights activists in the U.S. That year, the course of his life was altered irrevocably when he was indicted on highly controversial terrorism charges by then Attorney General John Ashcroft. These charges commenced a decade-long campaign of government persecution in which Al-Arian was systematically denied his freedom and saw his personal and professional life effectively destroyed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Despite the personal harm he suffered and the intense surveillance to which he had been subjected since as early as 1993, the government ultimately failed to produce any evidence of Al-Arian\u2019s involvement in terrorist activities, instead relying at trial overwhelmingly on the pro-Palestinian writing and speaking he had done over the years.",

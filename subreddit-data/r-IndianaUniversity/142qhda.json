I just wanted to get some tips that anybody might have like things to look out for, things to join, or how to really thrive as a student and get the best out of it at IU.",

            "comment": "Here is my advice on K201, as someone who will be a peer mentor next semester. It\u2019s not a hard class, just time consuming. Sit down and do all of the review and preparation assignments before class and you will do fine. The fact of the matter is no class is that hard if you attend all the classes and do the work expected of you. Not saying you will get an A in all of the classes, but if you do the work and work hard, you will succeed your first year. \n\nLearn new ways to study in college, high school is very different. I did not feel prepared for studying and was thrown off a bit when I got my first exam back. Don\u2019t let a bad score throw you into a loop and make you think you won\u2019t make it. Take that score and use it for inspiration, not a excuse to get mad at yourself. \n\nBusiness presentation and compass I are the easy classes. People say Accounting is easy, but it threw me in a loop. My professor did not prepare me for the final that was worth 50%, plus I lacked the study aspect of colleges. Economics is a more difficult subject to grasp, but make sure to learn the material and not just cheat to pass the weekly tests. I took finite and calc at ivy tech so I can\u2019t speak for that, but I would highly recommend taking it at ivy if you can, but not a big deal (idk if you can even take it at ivy and have it transferred nowadays). I already mentioned k201, but I don\u2019t see how everyone is worried about that class, maybe it just comes naturally to me. \n\nAnyways that\u2019s my advice. Stick your nose in a book or two instead of partying all day and night. congratulations on being DA. I was not a DA, but from what I understand it\u2019s a little less weight on your shoulders when it comes to grades. Try hard and don\u2019t dig yourself into a hole, you never know what might come your way.",

When I was in school people frequently felt as though advisors, particularly New Student Orientation advisors mislead them, causing people to take the wrong classes during freshman/ sophomore year. You should talk to advisors, but also do your own homework and don't just blindly trust them, even when you start. Maybe Kelly will have it better.",

            "comment": "If you don't already have one, and you're going to be purchasing a new computer for school, **get a Windows device.** Even if you prefer Mac.\n\nAlso, when/if you go to buy, make sure to use resources in https://kb.iu.edu/d/antk to see about student discounts. Take the minimum hardware recommendations there with a grain of salt by the way and think of them as true absolute minimums, in that anything less than that would barely function anyway. I personally would never buy anything with merely a 2ghz processor, and only 8gb of ram in it nowadays. That's just asking for resource bottle-necking, where something running sucks up all the available memory or processing power, slowing down everything to a crawl until the offending process is either done doing what it needed to do, or is killed. For example, Windows Defender (the built in AV package for Windows) is really bad about this on weaker machines.\n\nAs for *why* I say to get a Windows device, some of Kelly's big classes use functions in software that apparently just don't work in the Mac version. I think it's something to do with Excel features. If that's the case, I bet it involves some of the differences listed here: https://spreadsheeto.com/mac-vs-windows/ (just close the full page popup via the x in the top right).\n\nI work in IT support at the school, and we used to assist Kelly students with using bootcamp to install Windows as a second OS on a partition on the Mac, but that doesn't really work anymore given that you can't install Windows via bootcamp on the ARM architecture used in the new Apple Silicon CPUs. You can emulate and run VM's of Windows on them with stuff like vmware I think, but last time I looked it was all paid software and IU IT support will definitely *not* assist you with setting that up, and our options would be pretty limited for assisting with any issues that popped up due to it later too. Maybe there's something free out there nowadays that could work if you're willing to risk it and provide your own support.\n\nSo when those new Apple Silicon CPUs were first coming out, for folks with those new Macs, their only choices were to buy/use a separate Windows device or commit to being on campus in the STC labs for the classwork that required Windows. It's less of an issue lately now that IUanyWare (https://kb.iu.edu/d/bbbr) has a VPC connection for Kelly students to use for those classes, like k201, but still. That service is linked to actual physical devices on campus that can only be used by one person at a time, and if they're all in use, or some other issue occurs, you're stuck either going on campus or waiting. This could be problematic if you procrastinated and are working against the clock, alongside everyone else who does the same, and those devices all get used up. So honestly best to just avoid the issue altogether and use a Windows device if you can.",

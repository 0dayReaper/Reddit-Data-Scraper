    "postText": "I'm signed up, but pretty much I'm already a strong swimmer. I swam for about a decade competetively through elementary and high school, so I know all of the strokes, basic rescue work, ect. I'm assuming I already know most of what'll be taught, but the most advanced aquatics class interfered with a class I need to graduate, so this was the next best option. I thought this would be a fun blow off class because I just wanted an excuse to swim for twice a week, but now I'm wondering how much time is spent in the pool v lecturing? And when we are in the pool, will we just be doing drill work, or what's it like? I just want a set period to swim with other people (so boring alone!), so I'm wondering if I should drop.\n\nAlso I realize I could join the swim club, but I did that for about a month my first semester at IU pre-covid (2019, senior now), but the team seemed super cliquey and most of the people were not friendly. Like hardcore peaked in highschool vibes imo. It definitely could've changed by now, but those experiences have soured any thoughts of joining again.",

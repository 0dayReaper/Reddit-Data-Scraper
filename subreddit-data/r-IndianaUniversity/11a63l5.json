Now we are expanding our research to College Basketball. Please help us ensure that Indiana is included by taking 9 minutes to complete our updated survey:\n\n[https://umassamherst.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_3FdJ8eN2EgFCfCB?grpID=1472&amp;mbsrc=SPB307](https://umassamherst.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3FdJ8eN2EgFCfCB?grpID=1472&amp;mbsrc=SPB307)\n\nOur previous results have been featured in numerous sports media outlets, as well as the Wall Street Journal and New York Times. You can view those results, links to media coverage, and learn more about us at our KnowRivalry.com website.\n\nWe use the Qualtrics online survey software for data collection. This academic research has been approved by two universities' Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and it poses no risks to respondents. You'll find more information on the disclosure agreement that is required to start the survey. Thank you for helping us to include Indiana by participating and please share this with any other fans that may also help.\n\nReece Tolliver, Student Researcher, Northern Kentucky University\n\nDr. Joe Cobbs, Northern Kentucky University \n\nDr. David Tyler, University of Massachusetts\u2014Amherst",

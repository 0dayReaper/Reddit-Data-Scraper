I\u2019ve heard back from all of my other schools, but I\u2019m still missing prescreening round results from Indiana university. \n\nMy friend who applied here last year apparently got her prescreen results first out of all the schools, so I feel like something is wrong?? \n\nDoes anyone know if results are out yet?",

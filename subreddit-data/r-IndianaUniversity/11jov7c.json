    "postText": "I was recently admitted pre-business and I plan on attending and getting standard admission to Kelley. I have a few questions regarding the process.\n\n1. I've heard so many horror stories about A100 and K201. Any specific things I can do that will help me do well in these classes?\n2. Any really good professors for K201 and M119? Any I should avoid?\n3. I'd be curious to see if anyone has taken A100 and K201 in the same semester or know someone who has. I thought of taking them in the first semester along with easier classes to put the hardest behind me, and I'd finish the rest of my pre-reqs in the spring. I'm pretty intent on rushing, and this would give me more time to do so in the spring because from what I understand balancing pledge activities in a typical frat with a class like K201 would be nearly impossible. I really just want to avoid rushing as a sophomore. I figured it might help that A100 is only an 8-week course. Obviously, this could be a huge mistake so I was wondering if the workload would still be manageable if I devoted the majority of my time to studying.",

I\u2019m not going to sugar coat it, K201 is heinous. The first 8 weeks is Microsoft access that if you put it in front of me now I still would have no idea what I\u2019d be doing. The lecture section that goes with K201 really doesn\u2019t matter much just have to study terms on a quizlet before the midterm. After the midterm you go into excel which is actually interesting and something you should really pay attention to because you\u2019ll use it your whole life. Basically what to take away from this is 1) don\u2019t trip about A100 2)pay very close attention to k201 especially access 3)if you miss class in either of this courses your screwed because the profs move so quick.",

Would you suggest taking A100 the second 8 week session to manage the workload between that and K201? Again I appreciate the advice.",

You guys can teach each other, as well as work on the projects together. It also makes doing the work less boring. Towards the beginning of the year if you go to your dorm\u2019s computer lab there\u2019s a good shot someone else is doing k201 down there. \n\nAs a standard admission kid going through the process of applying right now im telling you A100 and K201 arent bad, but TAKE FINITE MATH ELSEWHERE.

I work with several local nonprofits and was wondering if anyone had any storage totes, floor or desk lamps, cleaning and hygiene supplies or non  perishable foods that are going to be left behind during move out. I personally pick up and deliver to whoever will use them. Thanks for considering, and happy summer!",

    "postText": "Hi, I am an incoming freshman and plan to major in finance at Kelley. I plan to bring my desktop to keep in the dorm, but I also wanted to get a laptop for classes and was thinking about a new mac. I know there\u2019s a lot of excel/office/powerpoint used, but I have experience using boot camp and now that there\u2019s IUanyware is it a ridiculous idea to get a macbook?",

There isn\u2019t much difference between using a Mac and a PC to a standard user at IU at this point (at least for the vast majority of tasks) I\u2019d say it boils down to personal preference honestly.",

And honestly, its best to do the GPS and practice stuff on the computers they have- they are plentiful, and will always be acesible, whether in your dorm, the library or anywhere really. It will better simulate the exam conditions, as the layouts will differ from your laptop, and it gets you used to the larger screen, rather than smaller laptop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSmall things, but they do add up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would just buy the nicest, most powerful laptop you can afford to. It can't hurt, only help.",

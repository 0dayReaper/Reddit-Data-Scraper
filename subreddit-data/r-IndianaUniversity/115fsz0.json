If you sign up you have the option to attend a movie, go to a keynote and dinner, get a massage, and much more. Also, you can attend up to 4 of 24 breakout sessions (listed in the \"Breakout Sessions\" tab) about many topics from tech skills to wellness and career development. I'll be leading the session \"Outsmarting Outlook\" teaching Outlook rules and such (which as an IU student you may find particularly helpful). Hope to see you there!",

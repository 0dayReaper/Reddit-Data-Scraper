The issue is the bedrock in Bloomington (and the surrounding region) is not that far below the topsoil, which means the ground can\u2019t really absorb water all that quickly. A lot of rain + sluggish natural ground absorption = flooding.",

I never said it was someone else's job or assumed someone else would take care of it like some mythical landscaping department.     \nI did this so that when I gave the Herman B Wells statue my daily good luck kiss, I could look Herm in the eyes and tell him that I did good today.     \nI would still be knee deep in that brown lagoon if I could, but I am totally bedridden from a freak jetski accident that I cannot discuss per settlement terms with Yamaha.    \nSo you, your generation, must be my hands and do my work, pickup where I left off.

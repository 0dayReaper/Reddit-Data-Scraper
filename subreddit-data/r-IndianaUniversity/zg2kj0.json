I was nominated by my counselor for the wells scholars program and I want to connect with a previous year's scholar to clear some doubts regarding the process. \n\nI didn't know where else to look, which brought me to reddit. Please guide me on who I should reach out. \n\n*If you help me, I'll bring you the tastiest indian snacks when I come to IU, promise :)",

    "postText": "Visiting IU Campus this year for a one week residency for my MBA requirements. Was just wondering what is there to do in Bloomington for those that are a little older (30). Mostly interested in places to eat or places to see. I have never been to a university campus either so it\u2019ll definitely be a new environment for me.",

Classical, jazz, R&amp;R, etc. Lake Monroe is nearby for water sports, lots of fishing opportunities.  Campus is surrounded for miles with state and national forests for hiking, biking, camping.",

            "comment": "What time of year are you going?  What do you like to do?  Plenty of restaurants and bars around the square, Kirkwood, College, and Walnut.  Hoosier National Forest (the Fire Tower just past the causeway and a little drive into the park) and some surrounding lakes provide some off-campus options.  Frisbee golf at Karst Farm Park is another.  Oliver Winery is just north of town--crappy wine but can be a fun experience with a small group to get buzzed for the afternoon.\n\nIf you are heading there in the summer you'll find all options available if you are wanting to steer away from the larger, younger crowds---Still plenty of older people visiting these establishments and locals either way so you won't stand out like a sore thumb if that is a concern. Lots of good food and classic IU haunts: Nick's, Lennie's, Zagreb's, Upstairs Pub, Irish Lion, Trojan Horse, Kilroy's for stuffed breadsticks, FARM for good fresh food.  Live music at the Blue Bird.  The Union is a place to study and walk around.  You can work out at the SRSC if they are giving you some sort of pass or just jog around campus.  \n\n\nIf you are up for a short drive you can head into historic Nashville, IN.  They have some good concerts coming up there. Classis small shops and decent food there too.  I'd make a day trip out of that coupled with Hoosier National if you're into that sort of thing.",

I don't know where you're traveling from, but in August, it's gonna be pretty warm and there are lots of outdoor activities also available",

Alley bar can also be fun to strike up a conversation with a stranger.\n\nHike and/or rent a kayak at Griffy Lake which is close to town.  You can also check out lake lemon and lake Monroe a little further out.\n\nFood: runcible spoon, hinkles, anywhere on 4th street (between Dunn and grant st), mother bears or Rocky\u2019s for pizza. \n\nWe have a beautiful Tibetan cultural center on the south side of town that you can wander around and sit in for meditation and tea.\n\nOur theatre and dance scene is pretty amazing.  Look up what\u2019s playing at the Waldron, Buskirk, Bloomington Playwrites Project, and the various performances on campus through Theatre and Dance,  the Jacobs School, and IU Auditorium(the auditorium hosts big concerts and touring broadway shows).\n\nCoffee:: hopscotch, needmore, soma\n\nI would avoid the bluebird on Wednesday nights(cheap beer, but so packed you\u2019ll spend the bulk of your time waiting at the bar for a drink). \n\nThere\u2019s a bunch more..but my thumbs are tired.",

What would you personally recommend in terms of bars I can just hang out and drink maybe strike up a conversation with people. Nothing too crazy, my body can\u2019t handle that anymore haha!\n\nI\u2019m not much of an outdoor person, I\u2019m 30 with a knee replacement due to my time in the military so I like to chill out somewhere with good ambience.",

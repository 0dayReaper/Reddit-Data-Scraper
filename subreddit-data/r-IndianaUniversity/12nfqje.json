The majority of Luddy alumni in FAANG rn probably grinded leetcode and were involved in a lot of different clubs on campus. If you\u2019re active in the CS club GroupMe, most of the current FAANG employees would be more than happy to give referrals.\n\n In terms of getting a good job, it\u2019s definitely possible, but do know that most Luddy alumni with good jobs didn\u2019t go through career services for their jobs. I haven\u2019t heard many good things for their \u201ctechnical interview prep\u201d either, apparently they just ask a random LC question and ask you to go through it, which anyone can do with their friends. Behavioral interview prep might be well executed though, but I haven\u2019t heard much about it.",

Their network is good for big 4, but that\u2019s only gonna get you into tech consulting at best, which doesn\u2019t really compare to SWE salaries. I\u2019d recommend doing a math minor (2 more courses over you regular CS math requirements) and a data science minor (2 more courses over your base CS prereqs). Use the time saved to do lc, and try doing UROC in your sophomore year(you can do freshman year, but tbh you won\u2019t learn too much). If you\u2019re gonna go towards tech consulting switch to informatics, the curriculum places very well into that domain compared to CS. \n\nI was also originally considering a Kelley minor but for a CS major, having math and data science helps alot more. Even after taking these 2 minors, you\u2019re only taking 12 more credits than usual, far less than the 21 minimum for a business minor. With all that saved time, you can focus on getting a decent GPA and practicing for technical interviews. \n\nRegarding your other comment, UROC is one of the better parts of Luddy. I would suggest looking for a prof in a domain that interests you, and try seeing if they\u2019re part of a foundation that sends students for Google Summer of Code. 1 UROC term and other consistent open source contributions almost guarantee a place in GSoC the following year. If you\u2019re a US Citizen, go for REU for freshman summer if you can\u2019t find a internship, they\u2019re alot less competitive and still give good research exp.",

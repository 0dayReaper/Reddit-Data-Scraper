But after we get alotted our dorm can we request a change?\n\nAnd is there any way to connect with the 2023 freshman like a discord server, Facebook page etc.",

With that said, I am fairly certain that you can add info to your housing application up until dorm assignments made.  Your best bet is to call or email housing with this question.  I would also ask them best way to find a roommate/roommate match process.",

Before that the Admissions office sends out information on \u201cHoosier Match\u201d which is a private company that helps students find roommates.  There are likely other ways but that is there tool offered.",

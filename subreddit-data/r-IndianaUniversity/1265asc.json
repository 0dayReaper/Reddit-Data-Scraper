    "postText": "Hi everyone, \nI recently got admitted to the MSES program and am currently debating whether to choose IU or OU. The coursework required for IU seems much harder than OU. Anyone who is in the MSES, is it really difficult? Im starting to worry about the difficulty of the core courses required, especially the math one. I also looked over the MES requirements and am now starting to rethink everything lol.",

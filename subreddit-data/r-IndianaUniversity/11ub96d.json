            "comment": "Depends on what your offer is. Bloomington has a fairly high cost of living and the graduate stipends aren\u2019t always the best with that in mind. I\u2019d look at the cost of living at the different places you\u2019ve gotten into vs how much they give you and see which is the most reasonable? I\u2019ve been able to do my graduate studies here fairly comfortably because my wife works full time and so my housing hasn\u2019t been as much of an issue. \n\nOutside of that Bloomington is pretty fun. It\u2019s a nice campus there\u2019s really fun restaurants and often small activities to do.",

            "comment": "You might get more useful responses if you share a few points about what decision(s) you face, and which factors are most important to you when making a decision. For example, if you\u2019re financially strapped, ask about cost of living, stipends, etc; if you\u2019re a POC, ask about diversity, townie acceptance; if you\u2018re unsure about the faculty in your program, ask relevant questions, etc. As it stands, I have no idea what to tell you. Asking good questions will also make. Your PhD program more fruitful, regardless of where you go! Good Luck!",

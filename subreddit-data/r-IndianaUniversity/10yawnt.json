Anyone who selected housing between like Feb and May were in the first bucket and rand within it, then the next bucket was people who applied after May (the dates might not be exact). I think that's just for new students, for returning it matters more.",

You will be more likely to get the dorm you want etc. As for neighborhood, I would honestly choose something closest to your classes (just makes it easier). And I would steer clear of the non air conditioned buildings, like Wright, they are extremely crappy and not well kept. \n\nIf I\u2019m honest, I would move off campus as soon as possible, RPS is very dysfunctional and such a pain to deal with (I\u2019ve had to deal with them until I finally moved off campus and they were awful)",

Tbh, I don't understand the new system at all because I haven't had to deal with it, but the buckets comment seems accurate. I worked for the Office of Admissions last semester which is when I heard about it, I don't live in the dorms though, so I didn't bother trying to understand it lmao",

Select groups like freshmen beginning in the Marching Hundred or International students will be able to move in somewhat earlier. You can schedule your move in any day between Monday and (I think up to Friday) before classes.\n\nWhen you eventually receive the email with the instructions on how to select the time and date of your move in, you will have an option of the time (morning or afternoon, to manage how many people are there at once-move in week is nuts) and the date of course.\n\n You should start by checking in on that date at assembly hall where they will check you in *bring your crimson card* From there you will go to your center and get all your stuff up to your room, begin making friends (and promptly forget about them In a month lol), and begin your intro to the college experience.\n\nTL:DR; Aug 14th, probably, but you'll get an email",

    "postText": "Our son applied and and has been accepted as an incoming Freshman to IUB.  Given the mismatch of school years between our southern hemisphere location and the US, he decided to do a semester of university locally - to keep his brain warm and to spend some time with his mates.\n\nWe have now have just discovered this on the IU website:  \"All students who have started university work after completing their secondary study should apply as transfer students, even if they have not yet completed their first term exams at the time of application.\"\n\nI guess our son could just not mention that he had a semester of university here but it would nice if he could get credit for the work he's doing.  We don't have a feel for how big of a mistake has been made.  Any thoughts?  Thanks.\n\n(For whatever it's worth, he applied to IU well before starting the local semester.)",

Unfortunately it may be difficult to get all of the credit articulated but there may already be an existing set of course articulations (the chances of that are higher if the university he took classes at is larger, since more students will have attempted to bring credit to IU from it). Good luck!",

Students who are currently full time at IU are taking courses from outside organizations (like Ivy Tech) and then transferring credits in. I personally took classes at Ivy Tech and 4 different IU campuses (online for 3/4). It might seem like you\u2019ll lose out but once your son gets in and has an advisor they will help. \n\nAn example of why you shouldn\u2019t worry is freshman coming in first semester with AP or dual credit courses. Those obviously transfer in as college credits.",

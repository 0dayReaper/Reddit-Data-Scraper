    "postText": "Hi! So I have been admitting into IU Bloomington and my major is Pre-Music Ed. I already have my classes and I\u2019m getting my audition polished. I\u2019ve been pretty stressed because I know only 10-15 UD students get admitted. I was just wondering if anyone could answer a couple of questions? Thanks!",

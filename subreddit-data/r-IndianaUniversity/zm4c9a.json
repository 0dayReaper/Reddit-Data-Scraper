You will need to take a combination of some of the Kelley pre-reqs alongside your schools pre-reqs. One of the more rigorous aspects of this process is you typically need Bs or better in all courses to be admitted.\n\nYou can totally reach out to a Kelley academic advisor for their advice as well",

You don\u2019t technically declare your major until end of sophomore year, you technically are admitted to the school associated with the computer science program at this moment.\n\nYou will need to apply to Kelley after going through their process. I would highly advise that you reach out to an advisor because as much guidance we can provide here, you should rely on the professionals.",

Kelley is a great school and a great program, sets you up with great careers, etc. You can do double majors if you want, which I think would really be a dual degree, but I don't think it's necessary.\n\nIf computer science excites you and you think you will be good at it, there is no career with more prospects, or higher paying ones than comp sci. If you are career minded and driven, comp sci will set you up incredibly well. Whether you go into consulting, big tech, or a start-up, you will be set up for success.

But it is much harder to get into programming without the requisite knowledge that you would get from compsci classes, and relatively easy to get good at finance and parlay that into a successful career.\n\nIMO you should stick with compsci for now and see how you like it, but meet with your advisor and let them know you are interested in taking some finance classes to explore career options. You do not need to be in Kelley to do that, but if you are in Kelley its hard to take classes from outside the college.",

With what you say about not being sure, staying in your current major is definitely the best course as it allows you maximum flexibility, not to mention CompSci is a great program and generally a higher paying major. Go hoosiers and good luck!",

Then, if you get a B or better in all of your freshman year classes, you are automatically admitted to Kelley.",

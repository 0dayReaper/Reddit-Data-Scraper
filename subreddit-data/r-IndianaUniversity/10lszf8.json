Just check out the stats for every SEC and Big 10 school.  \n\nMy daughter had a 4.6 weighted GPA, NHS, Spanish NHS, started and grew a business for 4 years, and has just under a 1300 on SAT and was deferred from every school (even ones we thought were safety schools) except Indiana and Pitt.",

She applied to Rutgers, Clemson, Indiana, Wisconsin etc. A 1300 puts you in the 87 percentile.  That should be more than enough to get accepted to these schools especially with her grades coming from a nationally ranked HS. \n\nThe issue is most definitely numbers.  You read any number of articles and the total number of applications have increased, despite the total number of first year enrollments going down.  \n\nFor example, pre Covid, 26 people from her HS applied to Clemson.  This year 52.  \nIllinois - preCovid 10, post Covid 31\nMaryland -preCovid 68, post Covid 98\nPitt / preCovid 52, post Covid 81\nTennessee - pre Covid 4, post Covid 28\nIndiana - preCovid 35, post Covid 54\n\nHer HS didn\u2019t have some sort of population boom, people have increased the number of schools they are applying to.  More than likely due to SAT optional and common ap.\n\n\nThey are deferring EA\u2019s to the broader pool unless you\u2019re elite with the hopes that people withdraw their applications.",

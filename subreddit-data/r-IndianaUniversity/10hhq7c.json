The depth of the belief and the escalation to violence were certainly impacted by her mental illness, but the belief itself came out of media she consumed, people she spoke with, etc. IU has a lot it can do to prevent attacks like this - it's an institution of higher ed and a research school. It can use the methods their faculty discover and teach about to combat racism in communities.",

All I heard was the writer saying these people are not doing it right and are not helping now. But nothing about what they expect differently. The author seems to want a magic wand and make all bad people go away.\n\nWhat would the author have them do to make a difference today as they seem to say?",

Not words.\u201d I applaud the sentiment but it is just more words without actually actionable suggestions.",

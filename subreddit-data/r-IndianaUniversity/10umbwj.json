I was wondering if I could apply for housing prior to actually accepting the schools offer. I\u2019ve seen resources implying both that you can and that you cannot. Input from anyone who knows more about this would be greatly appreciated.",

Think of it like paying to process your application (and from their perspective they can\u2019t have some % of their rooms locked up by people who ultimately don\u2019t attend).  Although, if you do choose to attend, that $200 goes to your room/board bill.",

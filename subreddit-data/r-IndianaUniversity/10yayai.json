    "postText": "I am a high school senior from Germantown, Maryland. I have to pick between Indiana University, Ohio State, and UMass Amherst for Finance. I want to go out of state for sure. I know UMD CP is great and all but really just want to leave.\n\n1. What is the party scene like? Big or small? Exclusive only? Only weekends?\n2. How good is the food? (UMass is best in undergrad but still)\n3. How are the dorms?\n4. And anything else I should most definitely know? What stood out to you on the first day of school?",

            "comment": "1. It is what you make it. Want to drink every night? Bars will be busy enough to be fun any day of the week. Want to never go out at all? There are literally thousands of students (probably 10k+) doing the same thing. Naturally, better parties are harder to get into, but the bars are always there. I think the differences are marginal between big state schools in this regard.\n2. The food itself is fine. It's nothing great, but it's definitely not gross. The food systems  (staffing, ordering, meal plans, etc.) got decimated by COVID and the new administration and haven't fully recovered.You'll most likely only eat dining hall food freshmen year at any big state school. I don't think this isn't a great criteria to base your college choice on, but I understand the curiosity. If you're not just talking dining halls, our local food scene is fantastic and relatively inexpensive!\n3. Good! Generally I see our dorms as as new and nice as anything out there, with a couple of exceptions (Wright, Ashton). (I lived in Eigenmann which is still my favorite living situation I've had at IU.)\n4. IU is not particularly diverse, which was a little jarring to me coming up from the south. I did not fully process before showing up the incredible scale of IU Bloomington's enrollment. There are 30+ normal-sized high schools worth of students here.\n\nThere is definitely a very different school vibe here (and within the Big10 generally) than UMass Amherst and other northeastern schools. I think it'd be worth visiting one of each to evaluate which you think would fit you best. Between OSU and IU, Bloomington blows Columbus out of the water. Truly not even close. I am exceptionally biased but I don't think OSU offers anything over IU unless you're Ohio in-state.\n\nI understand the desire to leave, but truly, aside from a marginally-higher-ranked business school I don't think you have much to gain by spending the money to come here. (If money is no issue, come on over!) Realize that at a massive school (as all you listed are) there is also a massive distribution of students, and you will find a hundred people (uncomfortably) similar to yourself anywhere, and thousands with whom you get along well enough. If the important things to you are parties, food, and dorms, you'd be best served to go to the cheapest college (meeting some minimum major prestige) on your list and ball out with the money you save on a sick apartment, a ton of booze (bars are $$$!), eating out, etc. (Or blow it all on options idk)\n\nSource: C/O 2023",

There\u2019s always sometime to do, a more modern campus and a much more diverse experience. There are some downsides that are typical with every college like some outdated dorms and subpar food, but there are a lot of places off campus that\u2019ll take meal swipes that are absolutely fantastic and so much to do around campus that I was really only in my dorm to sleep and sometimes study if I couldn\u2019t find another spot on campus. \n\nBloomington is nice, but after living in a small town most of my life and moving for school, I can honestly say that I miss living in a large city and having everything within a 10 minute bus ride.",

I really enjoy Bloomington (so much, I may stay after graduation), but it doesn\u2019t match the energy of Columbus.",

If 20% of IU got the virus, and a fraction of them opted to go home (or behaved as awfully as Greek life members have), Bloomington would collapse entirely. \n\n7% is a great reason to take a healthy population off campus. Because young adults don't take on $100's of thousands of dolalrs of debt to have schools say \"if enough of you get sick, the problem will go away\"",

But blatantly ignoring them, as the frats have done, is why we have this problem. But herd immunity is idiotic, and you're even more idiotic if you think this is realistic. Achieving herd immunity means dozens of out breaks, a much higher death rate, devastating financial losses for the most vulnerable, and a myriad of effects you need to spend time investigating. \nWe aren't going to kill ourselves for 5 years. We need to be more strict on following guidelines, and support research facilities and organizations that work non-stop to find a vaccine, and develop more cost-effective PPE. But if you really think hers immunity is how we beat this, by all means, please go get yourself sick, quarantine, and keep your awful ideas locked in a dark room with you.",

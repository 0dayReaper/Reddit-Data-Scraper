Niculescu said the test can help evaluate a person\u2019s risk of developing higher levels of anxiety in the future as well as how other factors might impact their anxiety, like hormonal changes.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cThere are people who have anxiety and it is not properly diagnosed, then they have panic attacks, but think they're having a heart attack and up in the ER with all sorts of physical symptoms,\u201d Niculescu said. \u201cIf we can know that earlier, then we can hopefully avoid this pain and suffering and treat them earlier with something that matches their profile.\u201d",

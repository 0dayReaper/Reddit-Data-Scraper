    "postText": "I recently got accepted into IU and applied with intention to attend the Kelley school for business with a degree prolly in finance. Although I meet the criteria for direct admission as a freshman 34ACT 4.0GPA and 4.7GPA weighted, I missed the deadline by a day due to my login creds not coming in on time. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll be able to meet the criteria for auto admission sophomore yr so I was hoping to get some input on how the Kelley school of business is for people attending. I\u2019m currently debating attending UGA Terry or IU Kelley so I was wondering if anyone would have input on what all to consider when making the decision. Thanks!",

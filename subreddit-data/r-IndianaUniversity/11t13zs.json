    "postText": "Hi guy, so I recently got an admit to the MSDS-residential program at IUB. I really liked the course structure and the specific tracks provided to us by the program, but I have been getting a lot of comments regarding the location of the university and the potential prospect that getting internships is a lot harder. Would love to hear your thoughts on this topic.",

Your best bet is in Indianapolis. \n\nThe MSDS program isn\u2019t a ton of credits, which means most people don\u2019t take summer classes since you can complete all the courses you need in 2 years in just the Fall and Spring. \n\nThe best time for an internship is the summer. You could then apply for opportunities in Indy without having course commitments during the summer.",

I\u2019m sure the graduate office would also be able to help a little with your applications and whatnot. \n\nHowever, the MSDS program here is pretty large, so it\u2019s impossible for them to hook everyone up with an internship. \n\nI cannot speak on this process too much however. I didn\u2019t really seek out an internship last summer between my 2 grad years. Hopefully another person on this sub can speak more on this. I hope some of this info helps!\n\nEdit: Luddy and IU also have career fairs with networking opportunities and companies looking for people for internships / jobs.",

            "comment": "&gt; The Indiana Graduate Workers Coalition United Electrical Workers submitted a petition for an 8% salary increase to IU administration March 31. IGWC-UE requested this increase based on the estimated cost to maintain a given standard of living in Bloomington. The request comes as inflation nationwide is nearly double its long-term average of 3.28%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \n\n...\n\n&gt; At a Bloomington Faculty Council meeting on April 18, IU Provost Rahul Shrivastav said he did not support the proposed raise due to its potential cost to administration. \n&gt; \n&gt; Shrivastav said at the meeting the 8% pay increase requested by the IGWC-UE for all faculty, staff and graduate workers would cost the university $200 million and would require tuition to rise 12%. \n\n...\n\n&gt; According to Rob Potter, director of graduate studies in The Media School, there will also be fewer doctoral student admissions in the future to account for the 46% raise graduate students received last year after going on a four-week strike.     \n&gt; \n&gt; Potter said the university is decreasing doctoral student admission because the available budget for graduate students has not increased to account for last year\u2019s promised raise. \n\n...\n\n&gt; Pak said a petition from last year included clauses not just for graduate workers, but also every worker at IU. He said the petition got hundreds of signatures from all sorts of workers at IU. \n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cAdministration saw that the grad workers had not gotten a raise in decades and after going on strike, they got raises.\u201d Pak said. \u201cWhat they\u2019re really scared of is nontenure staff and faculty seeing this collective bargaining being effective, so they want to scare us off and say look at what the grad workers did to these departments. It\u2019s important that narrative is called out for what it is.\u201d \n\n...\n\n&gt; Pak said IGWC-UE intends to continue their role as the elected representative for SAA\u2019s at IU and that the group will continue to collaborate and fight for the interests of graduate workers.\n\nRE: \n\n&gt; the 8% pay increase requested by the IGWC-UE for all faculty, staff and graduate workers would cost the university $200 million and would require tuition to rise 12%\n\nI'd love to see that math.",

Somehow there\u2019s always money for leadership to get raises and bonuses but the average staff member is lucky to get a 3% raise annually and many not even getting that. I\u2019d love to be part of a staff union, but I don\u2019t have the time or energy to start organizing",

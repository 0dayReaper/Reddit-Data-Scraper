    "postText": "Hello!\ni got accepted into IU a few months back. Not sure if i\u2019m going just yet since i am still waiting a few more decisions but as of right now it is my top choice &amp; i\u2019m super excited about possibly attending. I had a couple questions about the university as a whole if you guys were willing to answer!\n\n1. are the dining halls good? how does the dining system work? (can you use dining dollars on nearby establishments?)\n\n2. how are the dorms? which are the best ones, which ones have certain tropes to them (party dorm, quieter dorms, older or newest ones, etc)\n\n3. how is the international scene like? are there many international students? many hispanic ones? (asking cause i am one lmao)\n\n4. i already asked here once but i\u2019ll ask again - is it particularly easy to internally transfer into Kelley?\n\n5. what\u2019s the party scene like &amp; what do you think about greek life in IU?\n\n6. are D1 sports a big deal?\n\n7. what are some cool things to do or places to check out around campus &amp; Bloomington? What do you think about Bloomington itself?\n\n8. anything else you may want to add!",

            "comment": "lmao ignore the other users first point most dining halls are shit, unless you\u2019re into pizza, burgers and fries on the weekends. stay away from wright, almost all dining halls can\u2019t make rice without undercooking it, and the weekend options are horrible. when spice road is open at forest it\u2019s somewhat decent though.",

            "comment": "1.) Generally yes. The dining halls probably wouldn't impress Gordon Ramsay, but they have pretty good quality and enough variety to keep you from hating everything. Read the iu dining website for all details, but the main dining halls are all you can eat/ buffet style and you get unlimited meal swipes. You get 3 meal Exchanges per week that you can use at other campus cafes and dining things. Around town, a number of businesses accept Crimson Card (student ID, room key, and meal card) payment, but for that you gotta pre-load the card with money.\n\n2.)  Dorms are pretty ok all around, again the IU RPS (Residencial Programs &amp; Services) website does a good job of explaining the differences. There's no real \"party dorm\" but ashton is the quietest, Read is the music dorm, and Eigenmann (or Eigey) is huge so there's lots of people. Teter and Ashton are usually considered the \"worst\" but they aren't too bad tbh. The the nicest is probably Union St Center, but that's apartments style and so it's extra. Read is my personal favorite with regards to location and living situation.\n\n3.) We have lots of international students! We have a number of culture centers too! There's lots of cultural events and meet ups and such and just general interaction between people. I would say it seems most international students come from Asia, but there's lots of people from all over \n\n4.) If you're not Direct Admit, you'll be in University Division. The advisors aren't the best, but just take a bunch of pre-requisite classes like English or math and you'll get a good GPA. That's all you really need is a good enough GPA once you get here. \n\n5.) The party scene is pretty strong, IU is one of \"the\" party schools, if you like to party there's no shortage, particularly in the summer/ fall semester. There's not as many big open house parties now in winter, but if you make friends you'll get invited places. I'm not a huge party guy, so the best part here for me is that the party scene isn't too over the top. If you just wanna chill on ur own or stay in and study that's totally doable and chill. With greek life, don't believe the movies, it's not all its cracked up to be. Unless you are really hell bent on def doing it then it's all a racket. Yeah frat parties are fucking crazy, but unless your parents are rich af and/or alumni of the school you're not getting into the business frats. The rest are slightly easier but in reality college life is better/ way more normal in a good way without worrying about frat shit. (Tho there are some others like Kappa Kappa Psi which is for marching band people, for example, and they're a service frat so they just do stuff like hangout or clean up the stadium kind of stuff)\n\n6.) Yes. Football for example, we won 4 games last year/this year. We would still absolutely murder the best High School team in the history of ever. \nAnd Basketball.... oh boy... Basketball is a Religion down here. There's a saying in Indiana as a whole: \"In 49 other states, it's just Basketball\" and In Bloomington we even take it a step further. Assembly Hall is a Cathedral of College Ball and you should pack your passion when and if you come here. (Yes, D1 &amp; B1G are a big deal)\n\n7.) My favorite thing about Bloomington and a whole and the surrounding area is that we're really close to all of the best state parks in Indiana. The Hoosier National Forest, Yellowwood State Forest, Morgan- Monroe State Forest, Turkey Run State park, Brown County state park, and lots more are relatively close and right outside Bloomington. And all around the Campus is absolutely beautiful all throughout the year, but especially in spring and fall. This is one of the nation's most beautiful College Campuses for a good reason\n\n8.) Just wanted to say that you should def come to IU, the culture here us great and we would all love to have you. I have two questions for you that will dictate if I have any other things to add, Where are you coming from and are you a musician?",

                            "comment": "Iu has a great music scene, if you put yourself out there you can find some folks, I just got invited to join a band today actually haha! I, myself, am also in the IU Marching Hundred which is out marching band, look it up on YouTube and you'll see lots of the cool stuff we get up to, (we'd love to have you if you can play a wind instrument) and I'm in our BRBB, or Big Red Basketball Band which is an off shoot of the Hundred that is lots of fun. We have lots of opportunities for music ensembles through the school for people who aren't studying  music too. The \"All Campus\" ensembles are Orchestra, Concert Band, Guitar ensemble, Jazz band, and Choir! There's all sorts of music things to do. \nAlso, the International Studies office that you'll be working with will definitely have great resources to connect you with plenty of great resources to help you out so far from home, from culture centers, to other international students, and everything else, they are pretty good. \nAlso, if you want to try to get a taste of the culture here with Basketball, our #1 Rival team is from Purdue University and they're playing here on Saturday, it's gonna be a HUGE event. I'm not sure what options there are in the Dominic Republic, but if you can find a way to see that game on TV or online, you really should watch it!!! The game starts at 4pm here, so with the time zone I think it should be 5pm where you are on Saturday, Feb. 4th. \n\nAnyway, I hope this all helped some, and I hope you chose IU. We'd love to have you here and I think you'd really like it! Stay cool and maybe see u in the fall!",

My student is currently in a pre- workshop program run by a large firm that\u2019s designed to prepare them for working at a large consulting firm. It\u2019s my understanding that Kelley has a fantastic rep with these firms, however I do believe there\u2019s a Midwest bias in hiring. If your ultimate goal is to land a position outside of Chicago and the Midwest, it might be worth looking at a different school. But much of that is really dependent on student motivation, as well. If you sit around and wait for Kelley to get you an internship, you are going to be disappointed. You need to do some work yourself to put yourself out there where you want to be.",

No one wears suits/ties anymore, generally speaking. Not even for interviews.",

Going to try as hard as possible for this one and then focus solely on doing decent on the final. Goal is to end up passing, B- if possible. It\u2019s a tough class altogether, but I\u2019m wondering if my performance in this class will be indicative of any future classes I take at Kelley as a marketing major? I know I-Core and such will be tough but is there like a class that I will have to take junior/senior year that is directly related to STAT-S 301?",

I\u2019m not taking a hopeful B- for granted, but just curious about how this class will possibly influence my future classes in terms of material.",

I would love to live with some people with shared interests so if you are interested in the arts and looking for a place to live pls DM me. \n\nA little about me: I am a 22/F from VA and am super excited to start at bloomington. I love a clean living space and am looking for anyone personable and friendly to share a space with. I love to read but also love to go out and am hoping to find people to do that with. Comfortable living with any genders. Looking for a 3-4 bedroom off campus home with rent under 800 each.\n\nDM if interested!!",

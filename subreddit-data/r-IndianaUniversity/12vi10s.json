    "postText": "I'm trying to decide on subletting or living on campus for taking summer classes. I'm currently living at Teter, and all students need to be out by May 6th, 10am.\n\nRPS is confusing on what their move-out policy is for students who are taking summer classes and living on campus. \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nTheir website says,\n\n&gt; Residents moving to summer housing will complete check-out at their current building and check-in at Ashton on Monday, May 8 between the hours of 9 a.m. \u2013 1 p.m.\n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nI don't have a car; I'd need to ask my friend to help me move. If I choose off-campus housing, does this mean there's a two day gap between May 6th and May 8th where I don't have housing? Would it be worth contacting RPS to ask if I can have a two-day extension so I can not be homeless for a day or two? \n\nNot sure if this info helps- if I choose on-campus housing, I'd only have to move my stuff right across the road (though I have a *lot* of stuff).",

Better to have in it writing or spoken to you that you have extended time because you're taking summer classes. Also, better safe than sorry so you can make sure you still have card access to Teter while moving out at a later date.\n\nIf you want less of a hassle, on-campus hosuing seems like the better option considering how close Ashton is. But, if you'd rather live off-campus, go for it! Either way, contact RPS or ask for the RLC of the Teter Center Desk for help.",

There are so many kids looking to sublet their places for summer. I think there\u2019s a FB page for those or call the apt you want to live at. You can negotiate for cheaper rent because people are stuck with apts they are paying for but they are not in town. I would think RPS would be helpful with that 2 day gap if you opt to stay at Ashton. Be sure you are talking to a competent person on staff who understands what has to happen with dates on contracts. The university usually charges a significant per diem for anyone in a dorm beyond the contract dates and needs to know where kids are at for security and staffing reasons. Good luck!",

            "comment": "If you choose off-campus housing, your lease start will depend on your specific lease or sublease, and might start May 6th. You need to figure out where you are living over the summer and when you are able to move in there before you will know how long you need to stay in your current housing. If you choose off-campus and your lease starts later than May 6th, contact RPS and ask for an extension. If you choose on-campus, or if your off-campus lease starts on or before May 6th, you don\u2019t need to do anything and will be fine.",

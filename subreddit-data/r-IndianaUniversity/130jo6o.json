If you\u2019re living in campus housing, you\u2019ll be put on a long waitlist for getting a parking spot, because they won\u2019t give out more parking passes then there are spots. \n\nFreshman are discouraged from having cars partly because of that, and also because in general all the extra cars from students can really clog up traffic around campus unnecessarily (because there are other options to get around campus easily like the buses, walking, biking, etc). In general Bloomington is a town that is kind of too small for its student population.",

But trust me it\u2019s something you\u2019re going to have to manage and it will be annoying at times. I will also warn you, if you do bring your car, tell as few people about it as possible. Or else you\u2019re gonna have people wanting to borrow it or get rides ALL the time.\n\nYou will most likely get assigned a pass that will be for a spot at the football stadium. Which is honestly pretty good for your use case of visiting home. One issue is that you have to move the car by a certain time nearly every weekend when football/basketball games are played. Im not sure where they suggest you park though. \n\nOn the weekend parking in a lot of places is free, used by free in CH spots and the parking garages on campus. So usually on a weekend you could move your car to the dorm lot of a nearby parking garage. That makes it even to access even. But you do have to juggle it back and forth between spots to avoid being towed/ticketed.",

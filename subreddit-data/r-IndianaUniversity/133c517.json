If you did, PM me the model and any additional details that could help identify it as yours (background image, color, condition, etc.). If the description matches, we can schedule a time to meet up so I can return it; to be certain you're the owner, I'll request that you bring your charger (the battery has died) and unlock the phone once it turns back on before I hand it off to you.",

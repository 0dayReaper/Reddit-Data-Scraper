Southern Indiana.\n\nI'm really sorry, but if someone ever told them they were safe as a non-white by living in Bloomington they were seriously misled.  I love this town, but as a totally privileged CWM I warn people moving here that we're not living in a walled compound of woke.  It's a very open-minded town *for Indiana in the midwest.*  Recalibrate.",

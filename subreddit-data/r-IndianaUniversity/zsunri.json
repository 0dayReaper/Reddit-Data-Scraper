    "postText": "I had a quick question. Sorry if this is repetitive but I am a freshman. I enrolled into a class called Living Well (SPH-R 142) which started this week. I realized I don\u2019t need to take it since I already fulfilled my S&amp;H credit. The calendar states that Sunday December 25th is the last day to drop a course without a grade of W. So if I drop this class today I will obviously get no W and no other repercussions? Thank you!",

            "comment": "yes, you will not get a W if it is before the deadline\n\nrepercussions would probably only happen if you went below full-time because you dropped or it results in you taking longer to graduate or something",

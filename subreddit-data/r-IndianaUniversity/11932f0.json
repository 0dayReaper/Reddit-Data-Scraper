    "postText": "I\u2019m a sophomore and my housing plan for next year collapsed. I was wondering if it was better to have a single apartment or try and find someone to duo with. I literally asked everyone I know but everyone already has a plan or doesn\u2019t want to room. I\u2019m really scared of going random because there are a million things that can go wrong. Going alone is overpriced and I won\u2019t be able to live by myself socially/mentally. I\u2019m running out of time and ideas so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated thanks.",

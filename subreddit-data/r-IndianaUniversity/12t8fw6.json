    "postText": "Parent of incoming DA Kelley student and have read alot about taking Finite at Ivy Tech.  For someone who is analytical, strong in math, but not a math junkie\u2026could she successfully earn high grade in Finite at IU ?  She has a 5 in AP Stats and likely to get 4 or 5 in AP Calc.  We are trying to decide if it is worth the time and money to take at Ivy.  Any professor opinions good or bad?",

But I had difficulty learning the math during the in person lecture, so IMO the course requires a lot of self-teaching. but I\u2019m sure if your kid is a DA and they don\u2019t skip class/not do homework/not study  they\u2019ll be fine",

So I can say it's a good school, one of the better community college systems in the country. Credits transfer. The difference is the smaller class size and being able to ask questions or take a class that's got a longer time period. I've got an acquaintance that took Finite at Ivy Tech and while the content is still the same and it's not easy, she had a less difficult time taking it there. IUB requires a certain amount of credits to be taken on their campus, but some can come from somewhere else. I've met other IUB students who save money by taking some of their generals at Ivy Tech.",

Getting a B in Finite won\u2019t tank her career. The only thing GPA super matters for is workshops, Kelley Honors, and some scholarships. Even then, one B usually isnt too much of make or break difference in these things. I also did none of those at Kelley, got great job offers, and I am now at a great law school. \n\nMy advice would be she tries to take it on IU\u2019s campus first, she can always withdraw and get a W if she does super bad, but she should honestly be fine and just worry about passing not necessarily get an A.",

            "comment": "Computationally the math is super simple think like 6's and 0's they arent complex numbers but there are like 40 of these numbers in one problem and that problem takes up an entire sheet of paper. So if you write one 6 that looks like a 0 the entire problem is wrong. Or if you forget the negative sign on a -3 it's wrong. So the precision is the difficult part. Given that most freshman who barely know how to study take the class and also a lot of students this is the first time having a teacher that has a thick foreign accent thats why so many people struggle but it honestly isn't difficult you just have to have good attention to detail and be precise.\n\nEdit: [Gauss-Jordan Elimination](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/91a6d1cf405d6a3a67049d38ad8de8da3c7c6fff133feef2c8c583a81f211fe9/68747470733a2f2f7777772e636f646577697468632e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031352f30352f6e756d65726963616c2d6578616d706c652d6f662d47617573732d4a6f7264616e2d4d6574686f642e706e67)",

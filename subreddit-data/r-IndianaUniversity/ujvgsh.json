    "postText": "I fucking hate the bell tower in the arboretum so goddamn much it is going to make my head explode.\n\nThat piece of shit cost like seven million dollars to put up and I have never talked to a single person who said, \"hey man, you know what I really fucking like? The bell tower.\" No one has ever said that. Not the underprivileged students who go here that could've benefited in a tangible way from those seven mil, or my peers, and definitely not me, as I sit in the LIBRARY hearing this fucking thing play Lady Gaga as I finish the last final of my college career. If you play the bell tower you are an asshole and I hate you.\n\nHave a great summer hoosiers, love you",

I'd estimate that about 80% of the students and colleagues I've talked to think it's ugly as sin and a waste of donor energy. As I said in a comment above, McRobbie wanted a new carillon so he went out and found a donor who would fund it. It's not like the donor just walked in off the street. We would have loved for him to put that fundraising acumen to some other more productive use at Jacobs.\n\nFun story, he offered to add a new low A-flat bell that would have cost $500,000 dollars, and was only dissuaded from doing so because there's no music written that would use it.",

Again, the carillon is a beautiful and unique instrument with passionate faculty. Who are you to say what programs are more important than others? Jacob\u2019s has one of the highest ranked organ programs in the country, it very much makes sense that they should have one. Many professional carillon players travel to our campus to give masterclasses and performances, it\u2019s a very cool community. And personally attack the dude? I\u2019m pretty sure he called anyone who plays the bell tower an asshole. Imagine devoting time and taking classes on this instrument, just to constantly see comments on tiktok, Reddit, and yikyak about how people hate it. It sucks. It\u2019s already built, it\u2019s not going anywhere, complaining about it doesn\u2019t do ANYTHING except disrespect the students who play it",

    "postText": "I'm a high school senior accepted to IU, and just curious about what goes on day to day. Such as time for lectures, doing hands on mock real IB work, etc, and how long it lasts, hours per week, etc.  \n\n\nI've seen a ton on Reddit about the difficulty of acceptance, so I know that it isn't guaranteed at all.  \n\n\nAlso, is it possible to do 2 workshops? Such as tech consulting and the investment management both done at once, or would that be too much of a time commitment?  \n\n\nThanks.",

Besides, you have to pigeonhole yourself so much to get in and stay in (they drop people ruthlessly even once you\u2019re in) a workshop it wouldn\u2019t be feasible to chase two career strings like that.",

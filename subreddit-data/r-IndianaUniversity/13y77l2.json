They will give you a letter allowing you to get a driver license without SSN. Next step is to go to BMV with the letter and other documents to take the tests. Also, you are required to take both the knowledge and the road tests.",

Frequency isn't great compared to internationally but the routes are good. There are also E-scooters during the day to rent and places to park bikes outside most buildings.",

Students have free city and campus bus access.\n\nParking on campus is tough to get and must be paid on semester basis with IU.  Definitely use support services geared to international students since these kind of questions are common to them.",

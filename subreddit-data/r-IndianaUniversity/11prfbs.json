So l'm currently doing a research for an assignment on students who cook few times a week.\n\nI need you need to answer 5 small questions for the next 10 days which I will be sending you in an email. Each question will take literally a minute, it's really easy trust me. I'll be asking what you cooked, how much time it took you and things like that - it's really simple.\n\nIf you're interested in helping me out for 10 days, I would really appreciate it!!",

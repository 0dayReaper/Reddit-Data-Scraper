    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'm currently taking time off of school to figure out what I want to study. I came across Hamilton Lugar while on my search and was blown away by the Central Eurasian department.\n\nIt's been a long time since I've felt this passionate and excited about something, but realistically, majoring in area studies/languages of any sort isn't profitable and there are evidently a lack of jobs.\n\nIt sure is nice to think about though, and so I've been trying to find alumni to speak with to see where they're at now. I'm clueless on how to go about this. How do I get in touch with former graduates, or are there any here who could tell me about their experiences?",

Don\u2019t be so focused on what your degree is in. Follow your passion. I turned my passion for graphic design and photography into two jobs.",

Because the academic advising session is coming up so I wanna have an idea before I talk to the advisor. Thanks.",

That being said, you don't have to or may not be able to follow it exactly, as course sign up may depend on when your sign up date is, the availability left in classes , etc. As long as you're getting the required i-core prerequisite classes you should be good.\n\nAlso, if you are thinking of going into investment banking or a similar pathway in the future, check out bus-f100. It's a required prerequisite class for the workshop, and is also a great way to learn more. Similarly. There is bus-f101, called the finance diversity program. This has a small application process, and is an amazing way to network and learn more about opportunities.",

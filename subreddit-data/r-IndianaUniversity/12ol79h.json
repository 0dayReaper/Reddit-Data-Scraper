I thought it was odd that a senior was living in freshman dorms going with a random roommate, and he had no ability to socialize so he just lived in a dorm room with hoarded garbage. Genuinely the worst experience of my life.\n\nGood luck!\n\nIn all seriousness, living with a shitty roommate is an important life experience. I was able to hold it in for a semester and got moved in December or so. There were some kids on my floor that flunked out after the fall so I got to stay on my same floor with my friends and all.",

I just think living together with friends ruins your friendship since you\u2019re spending every waking moment with them. All of my roommates in college ended up being random. The first I didn\u2019t get along with, and the next two became two of my good/best friends to this day. I\u2019m sure it will be fine. It\u2019s a good way to meet new people and if anything you guys might just exchange small talk and have your own friends/friend groups!",

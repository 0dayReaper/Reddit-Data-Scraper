Any person with greek info on their resume is an idiot. You're making it easy for hiring managers to discriminate against you (whether intentionally or subconsciously). The main benefit from frats are references, which add a word of mouth bias to hiring managers. Benefiting the candidate. LinkedIN for example has both strengthened and weakened this benefit.",

    "postText": "Hi there! I'm an incoming international grad student at Luddy School, IUB for Fall 23. I'll be arriving in Bloomington in the first week of August and am planning to move in by the second week. I have a few questions about off-campus student housing in Bloomington. What is the best time to apply for these apartments? I have researched a few options, but none of them are currently available. Should I wait until the end of May, when the majority of students graduating this year will leave their apartments, in the hope that they will then be put on the market? What would you suggest?   \n\n\nAdditionally, I am looking for 3-4 bedroom apartments in the College Mall area, with a budget of $500-$600 per room, that are not too far from the IUB campus and have a bus stop right outside the apartment. I would prefer to avoid staying in noisy areas. Any suggestions for good apartments/townhouses?",

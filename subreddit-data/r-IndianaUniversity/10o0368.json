            "comment": "I was in the same boat as you, got \u201cgood money\u201d and decided to go (current sophomore). So far I have considered transferring a few times, but in the end stuck with it. It\u2019s going to be nearly the same curriculum across all universities, the main difference is the profs and the fellow students. I\u2019ve never been anywhere but IU but I feel that the profs are good, not great. You\u2019ll have some amazing ones (Amr Sabry, Erik Wennstrom) and some horrible ones (Gregory Rawlins) but they do truly care about your education and it is possible to succeed and learn under anyone. That brings me to my next point, the fellow students. From what I\u2019ve seen, IU CS students are\u2026.hm. You\u2019ll have lectures with very low attendance, group projects where no one wants to contribute, and professor\u2019s questions in lecture that go unanswered. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing; you can use this to stand out and learn a lot, but you will have to be proactive. Finally, the curriculum is pretty standard as for the core courses; I really enjoyed taking those classes. If you have any specific questions about the AI courses let me know. \n\nOther stuff you didn\u2019t mention: IU is really good about involvement, and if you can think of an org, we probably have it. Luddy is no different, and I\u2019d highly encourage you to get involved in research, tutoring, CS club, Luddy leadership, ambassadors, etc. early on, if you have time.",

Bryce Himebaugh was probably the best professor I had at IU. He teaches some intelligent systems engineering/systems cs courses.",

                    "comment": "I should mention too, IU provides the grade distribution for previous classes, meaning that if you\u2019re looking to take C291, you can go and look at how students did in comparison to who was teaching it and what the students\u2019 overall GPA was (to get a sense of if they did better or worse in a class than they usually do). \n\nThis is very helpful information when it comes to picking classes and I don\u2019t think every university has it. I\u2019m doing a Masters in CS right now and I don\u2019t have this benefit, which makes picking classes harder.",

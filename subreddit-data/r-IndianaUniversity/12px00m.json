    "postText": "Hi,\n\nMy kid is going to school there in the fall. She is largely indifferent to what type of laptop she uses and is equally facile w/MacOS and Windows. We\u2019re primarily an Apple household and she uses her iPhone, when not using her school computer.\n\nWe talked about going with an iPad as her school device. Has anyone gone that route? She\u2019s going to be in the school for Arts and Sciences, so the types of apps needed for business and engineering aren\u2019t very likely to be needed.\n\nWhat kind of computer are you using? Mac? Windows? Chromebook? Other? (Is 2023 the year of Linux on the desktop/laptop?)\n\nCheers!\nA newly minted IU dad.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m in a very science heavy major, and I run a windows machine just fine (no Linux needed ;)) A lot of people use MacBooks though. If your kid isn\u2019t going to need anything for any heavy duty programming either option will be fine. It really comes down to personal preference (and the price tag of course) \n\nI personally think it\u2019s nice to have an actual laptop over the iPad, but again, that comes down to preference. I find that note taking on a computer is faster and easier (with the exception of math courses). Sometimes professors can lecture very quickly and I type much faster than I write. Of course, Your mileage may vary",

As for computer Mac or Windows are all ok but if she is doing art in technology like using Blender or any advanced software like Adobe Premier def need a good graphic card, and good amount of ram and storage.",

And honestly less hassle. She\u2019ll have access to office for MaC anyway. It\u2019s worth the money. My college MacBook still is running 10 years later just as fast and seem less as day 1 with proper care and updates. There\u2019s not a single PC that will take the beating of 4 years at college and uphold better than a MaC. I would bet my life\u2019s savings on it. The air or the pro should do the trick and do it well.",

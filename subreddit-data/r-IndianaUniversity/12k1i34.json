    "postText": "i was just accepted into iu as a voice major at jacobs and i have no idea which dorm i should pick. when i went to campus, the current music students said to live in either read or forest since those are closest to the classes ill be taking (read would probably be most convenient since it's right across the street and there's practice rooms in the dorms). however, im concerned about feeling too socially isolated in read, as ive heard its like 60% music majors. i want to have a social life and go to parties as well, and ive heard the northwest dorms are the best for that, but i also don't want to hike 20 minutes across campus from my dorm to my classes for that. forest ive heard mostly good things about- theres a good dining hall in there, its quiet, and theres an honors residential community there (i also got into the honors college). however, i heard theres not alot of social life. i know my situation is very niche but could anyone give me any advice? thank you!!",

            "comment": "I lived in Forest! I did love my dorm and made so many friends in it first semester, so I honestly wouldn\u2019t worry about the social aspect. One of my hometown friends was also in Read and she ended up making friends with basically her whole floor. There definitely were a lot of Jacobs students in my building, but there was actually a decent mix of other ones too. I do also feel like the location is really hard to beat for Jacobs students imo (it\u2019s like a 5 min walk which really comes in handy if you have early classes lol) \n\nOverall, it\u2019s just going to depend on the group of people in your building. But I wouldn\u2019t be concerned! We kept our door open a lot during welcome week &amp; that helped :) hope this helps and feel free to pm me anything else if you have questions",

On the housing application, you can only submit your preferences for the neighborhood and room type. It is a random game of luck and hoping for the best. However, there is a space to enter additional comments, so you can write about which specific dorm you want and explain why. Even then, there are no guarantees",

Choose the southeast neighborhood, that'll be Read, Spruce, or Forest your freshman year. All of them are close to Jacobs, Forest Eatery, and all pretty good dorms. You don't get to choose your dorm specifically, but the Southeast is your best bet.\n\nThe social life in all of the freshman dorms is what you make of it, everyone is looking for friends, and the \"reputation\" of any specific neighborhood is overblown.",

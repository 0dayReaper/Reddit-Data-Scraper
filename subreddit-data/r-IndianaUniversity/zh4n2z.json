            "comment": "It sits around in your IU file internally at the Dean of Students office doing nothing. They keep it in case you have another misconduct report. If you didn\u2019t get a serious sanction (F* for exp), it\u2019s nbd, and you don\u2019t have to worry about. However, you do need to mention it when you apply for certain things, when asked if you have ever had misconduct, because they do check. FBI once came to following up, but since the student had reported it, and it was a minor thing, it was fine. The idea is that the first time is a learning experience, and if it\u2019s not egregious, you get a pass \u2014 youthful indiscretion, bad judgement, you didn\u2019t know, whatever. After that, it may be consequential. Some grad programs ask, though.\n\nEdited to add this:\n\nAs far as getting it off your record with a class: there is a class students are often required to take, as part of the educational component of the process, but this does not get it off your record. Seriously, if you have one misconduct report for plagiarism, you really should just not plagiarize any more. Take the class, learn what it is, and knock it off. You have no idea how easy it is to check and catch it, if a professor can be bothered to do so. Most won\u2019t, but there are a ton of little give-away signs that make faculty curious and want to check, and once that starts, forget it \u2014 you are done.\n\nRemember, these people see literally thousands and thousands of student assignments over the course of a career and have a really good sense of what each student is capable of and what is not their own work, and what sources and resources exist. If they can be bothered to go forward with the misconduct process, it will be tears for everyone and at the appeal process, the Dean usually won\u2019t go forward unless it\u2019s a slam dunk that the student will be found guilty.",

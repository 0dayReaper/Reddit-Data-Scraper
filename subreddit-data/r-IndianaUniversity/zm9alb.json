    "postText": "Currently I live in a renovated double at eigy, which has communal bathrooms. A few months ago after the fall semester had already started, I was diagnosed with a chronic illness. I won\u2019t go into too much detail, but I will say that it is a bit difficult for me to share a room with someone and it is more difficult for me to share a bathroom with my whole floor. My doctor has suggested I fill out the medical form to move into a single, but I\u2019m a bit hesitant because they disregard any other preferences you may have and they just stick you somewhere that has room. My biggest hesitation is that I REALLY don\u2019t want to live in northwest. All my classes are in the southeast/central area and besides, those kids scare me. I so much do not want to live there that I would take living uncomfortably in eigy over living comfortably in northwest.\n\nSo here is my question. If I choose to move to a single, what are my chances of  getting assigned to northwest?? What are the dorms with the most singles?\n\nEdit: I should probably add that I\u2019m a freshman, so I will most likely stay in the dorms. It is also the cheapest option for me because my scholarship covers it.",

And the management (especially in on campus apartments) are so bad. Plus being off campus will give you more benefits and flexibility. \n\nBut if you have to be in a dorm, I would be on them about getting that single in the neighborhood you want. I think that\u2019s the only way you can get through to them because they\u2019re pretty dysfunctional.",

IU does a good job adhering to accessibility requests when it comes to documented medical needs. I would submit the paperwork ASAP. \n\nYou can always ask questions/ask to move if they put you somewhere you hate. But I almost bet you end up in an accessible room at Willkie like I did. If not, its better to submit NOW so there is more flexibility in where you end up.",

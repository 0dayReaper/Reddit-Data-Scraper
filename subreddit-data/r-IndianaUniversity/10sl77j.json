    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI wanted to share some good news! I recently received the Provost scholarship and while the amount wasn't as much as I hoped, I am still grateful for the support. I'm also thrilled to announce that I have qualified for the SSA and submitted an essay on food waste. I was wondering if anyone here has any information on the typical amount of money awarded by the SSA for scholarships?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post, and I appreciate any insights you might have to share.",

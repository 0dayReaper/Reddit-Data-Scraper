    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming CS freshman and I have already taken IU\u2019s M211 for calculus and both C101 and C121 for chemistry. However I plan on retaking M211 my freshman year to improve my calc skills and start my college experience with something familiar to try and ease some of the shock. I only ask this because the math placement says incoming students who have taken M211 don\u2019t need to take the test but if I\u2019m planning on taking it there does it still apply? And also do I need to take the Chem placement? Thanks for any help.",

You will need to work at it and spend a decent amount of time studying.\n\n Of the accounting courses I took it was one of the more time consuming and potentially difficult ones. Not because of the material itself but mostly because once you get to further classes (it was the second class I took for my program)  you have more immersed yourself in the mindset needed to grasp and execute the concepts. \n\nI've tutored a few students through the course at my old school and most where able to succeed and start connecting the dots after the first few weeks, but those can be tough few weeks. Some gave up at any sign of difficulty and struggled to do well in the course even with assistance and often dropped. \n\nHope that helps and good luck!",

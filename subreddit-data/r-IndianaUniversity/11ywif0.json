    "postText": "Hi, I'm Stepan! This summer I'm teaching a history course on the Vietnam War (A380). It carries the College S&amp;H Breadth of Inquiry credit and is fully remote. This course has been taught by many IU History faculty members and graduate students such as myself, and each instructor brings their particular flourish to teaching this interesting and difficult period in American history.\n\nSome of the topics that are often glossed over in similar courses but get more attention in mine include:\n\n* The First Indochina War and the longer history of colonialism in Vietnam;\n* Reaction to the war in the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc;\n* Pro-Vietnam War art in the U.S.;\n* The memory of the war in modern Vietnam.\n\nI'll be happy to answer your questions about the course here or by email ([stepserd@iu.edu](mailto:stepserd@iu.edu))! Summer registration is open. Tell your friends!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/28z9vfmhucpa1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e0a39bd28f4140ddabf701ec0067eceaa79ee85b",

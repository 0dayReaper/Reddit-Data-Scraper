    "postText": "In an older thread I saw Chase and IUCU recommended as bank choices. I notice however that both use Zelle, which our older son (who attends college in the NE) says is far, far less popular than Venmo. \n\nWhich platform do most people use at IUB?  If Venmo, any bank suggestions for an overseas newbie?  Thanks.",

Venmo connects to your bank account to withdraw/deposit money from. \nZelle I would use to pay roommates for rent/utilities while Venmo is for splitting the bill when going out to eat in a group.",

Venmo is definitely more popular and I use it more frequently. However, I much prefer using Zelle if my friends/acquaintances also have account since the money gets directly deposited into the receiving account. My overseas friends exclusively use Zelle and from what they\u2019ve voiced I don\u2019t think that they experience a lot of issues with paying people/getting paid :)",

Probably wouldn't be a good fit if you don't drink or something but wasn't anything notable party wise when I was there. \n\nI agree absolutely that there is a uniform KLLC type. I don't know if the KLLC forms it (I lean towards this explanation) or it selects for it, but it is a massively more homogenous crowd at a surprising scale then you will find elsewhere in the IU community.\n\nIf you do choose to pursue it make a serious, active effort to join non-Kelley organizations (club sports are great!) to ensure you remain an interesting person and not a fungible business drone.",

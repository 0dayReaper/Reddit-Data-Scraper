A lot of my friends in my dorm were standard admits for Kelley (I was a direct admit), and as standard admits you have to keep your GPA fairly competitive to get into Kelley when you apply freshman year, while direct admit students only have to maintain a C in all classes to move onto I-Core (the C grade will apply to you as well when you get into Kelley).",

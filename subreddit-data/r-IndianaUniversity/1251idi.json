It\u2019s right in the middle of campus so you don\u2019t have to walk that far for much like you would if you were in northwest neighborhood (mcnutt, briscoe, foster). It\u2019s also right next to wright dining hall, which is definitely the worst dining hall, but I thinks that\u2019s a sacrifice worth making for being in the center of campus",

I am a freshman, previous Kelley major, and it was helpful being around people with a similar major, the Kelley Business LLC, and the dorms are good quality (Walnut Grove, Briscoe) (McNutt and Foster are mid tier).",

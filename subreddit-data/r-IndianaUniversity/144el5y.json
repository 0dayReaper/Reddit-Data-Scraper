Any thoughts, comments or tips on starting Kelley as a sophomore? I\u2019d have to take all the basic Kelley courses this coming sophomore year; i.e. K201, business presentations, Econ etc.",

Classes like business presentations, business writing, kelley compass, are all mainly busy work, classes like Accounting, Econ, financial and managerial accounting, are heavy on material but are doable if you take the time to learn it.",

I\u2019ll be doing it this fall semester as a junior.\n\nAll of the classes you mentioned and I mentioned are perquisites to I-CORE. And some part of I-CORE is usually a prerequisite for some of the classes you take for your specific Kelley major.",

Here\u2019s what the Kelley page on the major describes it as: \n\n\u201cThis major is designed for students interested in creating and managing small businesses. The degree focuses on the study of special skills and knowledge needed by entrepreneurs and managers of small- and medium-sized firms\u201d\n\nIf you want to get a corporate job though, a major like Finance, Marketing, Accounting, Information Systems, would be better suited.",

No minors allowed in Kelley if you\u2019re in the business school. \n\nAnd a co/double major seems out of reach for business since you\u2019re quite a bit behind right now. \n\nI\u2019d focus on getting all your pre reqs so you can take icore, then go from there. Talk with advisors. \n\nAlso talk with the Kelley admissions team. They will be a good resource since you can\u2019t talk with Kelley advisors if you\u2019re not in the business school.",

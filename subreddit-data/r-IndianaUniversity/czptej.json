    "postText": "Less than 1 hour ago I was walking across campus with my headphones turned all the way up and changed directions at the last second, causing a very handsome skateboarder to crash into me. Rest assured that I am uninjured, and have, in fact, thought of a great idea! If you see this post and reach out to me, we can fall in love and then sell the movie rights to whoever makes those terrible Hallmark romcoms. This will make us millionaires. Thank you very much!",

If Andrew Dabrowski still offers it, he made it really approachable and even a bit fun. And that\u2019s coming from some who always struggled with math.\n\nBasically you study applied math. There are two different versions as I understand it. But the one I took focused on math in a couple different social situations. You look at the math of voting, math in ven diagrams, math in ordering supplies for large scale businesses, and finally probability.",

I didn\u2019t take notes before class and didn\u2019t study that much before the final and got a B, and I\u2019m not one of those students who gets an A without studying. I failed the midterm bc I didn\u2019t study.\n\nThat being said you can\u2019t use a calculator during the test which sucks and taking at Ivy Tech is def easier. Even tho Finite is hard, if u take it at IU and put in the work you\u2019ll be fine.",

With more people comes more range of skill. With more range of skill comes more people doing worse. This is ultimately what I feel like it comes down to. \n\nOverall challenging but not as hard as people say",

The last thing you need is to be spending 3 hours a day learning to solve matrices by hand.",

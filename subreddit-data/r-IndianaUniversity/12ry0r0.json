For example, many deaths on campus are suicides and the family does not want anything written. While that\u2019s not the case in this most recent tragedy, there are two families involved and she should vet anything written with both families. And now might not be the time to bother the families with this kind of public announcement.  I bet if you imagine your family member dying in a public way there may be many reasons why a broad based general announcement from the IU President might not be something you want put out there within days of the event. If the family asks, fine,  Personally I think statements from the leaders at Kelly, the Dean of Students, etc to a smaller audience of the student\u2019s peers is fine.",

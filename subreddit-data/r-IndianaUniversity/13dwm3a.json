    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman, looking for some ultra fun general education classes.  \nI scoured the entire list of 1061 courses, but found absolutely nothing fun/interesting besides  \n\\- the supernatural and folklore class  \n\n\nI was comparing with some friends, and theres some fun ones at other institutions, so it feels like IUB is deprived of pointless classes that I would have loved to take.  \n\n\nMaybe I just skimmed the list of 1061 courses too fast, so if anyone knows some fun courses that count as GE (Right now, all I plan on taking is the supernatural and folklore class and a drama class).  \n\n\nAn example of something, would be a stand up comedy class that counts for an English credit, or an \"intro to deadly poisons\" class that counts for a social studies credit.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ll be honest idk what a 1061 class is but I have some suggestions for random gen ed\u2019s and good departments to look for gen ed fulfilling classes: \n\nA few specific classes: the anthrophology class sex drugs rock n roll; MUS-Z 201 History of Rock n Roll; EAS-E 138 Geology of National Parks; MSCI-M 216 Medical Science of Psychoactive Drugs; BIOT-T 270 Alcohol and Food: The Science of Fermentation; BIOL-L 104 Biology of the Senses\n\nMore general ideas of department/subjects to look for gen ed\u2019s in one.iu course search: MUS-Z (music history, other MUS- classes could be fun if you want to learn to play guitar for example), MSCH-  (Media school including film and video games), SOAD - (art classes, I took Ceramics and it was really fun), SPH (School of Public Health including SPH-W 8week classes where you go do an activity related to the class e.g. kayaking trip)\n\nI will also say if you\u2019re in College of Arts and Sciences there are a lot more options for CASE breadth of inquiry gen eds, and some classes count for both. Just something to keep in mind if it applies.",

If you\u2019re really interested in the class you could try emailing the professor who will be teaching it in the fall and ask for a syllabus? But maybe don\u2019t expect a response right away over summer, lol.",

It teaches you to be aware of how you hold and move your body. It helps your public speaking/presentation skills. And it's fun, on top of all that! But every undergraduate student, at any college, should take an acting class.",

You\u2019ll find a lot more friends and the only downside is that you\u2019ll have to take some annoying classes for it (a 1.5 credit course each sem). Besides that, most profs are happy to help out, although in terms of UROC it\u2019s highly recommended to go with some prior exp.\n\nThere\u2019s a Luddy StuGov but I\u2019ve never really attended any of their events, but in general there\u2019s several clubs to get involved with. I won\u2019t say which one I\u2019m in, but it\u2019s pretty easy to get into the eBoards as a member of most Luddy Clubs, and the alumni who used to be parts of these clubs are more than happy to help you out when it comes to getting referrals and general career advice.

            "comment": "I'm a Freshman in comp sci.\n\nThere's two introductory courses: 200, which teaches Python, and 211, which teaches DrRacket. Im sure you have no idea wtf DrRacket is. Neither did we. Iirc it's a language used almost exclusively at IU to teaching programming.\n\n200 is, from what I've heard, easy, because Python is easy.\n\nI took 211, and it's hard. Ridiculously hard. The \"You will most certainly need to make friends in the class so you can help each other\" kind of hard. But it does teach vital comp sci concepts. Or at least that's what they tell us lol.\n\nFor my second semester I'm taking 212, which teaches Java, and 241, Discrete Structures. 212 has been fairly easy for the most part, but I mainly learned by watching online tutorial vids rather than paying attention to the lectures. 241 is usually taken during Sophomore Year, and I see why. I wanted to get it over with, but it has a heavy workload and the concepts can be very confusing. Most of the time I've had moments where a concept \"clicks\" for me and I struggle less, but idk if that will happen with everything we learn. On the bright side, the professor I have allows corrections which can bump your grade up from an F to a B on practically every assignment.\n\nI'm in Luddy. Has a lot of benefits, but I haven't made much use of them because, again, very busy all the time every day. If you come and enroll in Luddy, I wouldn't recommend the Luddy Learning-Living Center. You have to take a required class that pretty much just adds onto your workload, the semi-private bathrooms have weird stains (including blood stains) and broken facilities, not a lot of gender diversity, and many people who don't shower and quite literally stink up the halls. People say you\u2019ll make friends, but it\u2019s one of those things where if you don\u2019t make friends in the first 3 weeks or so you\u2019ll feel out of place because everyone\u2019s already found their groups. Though I guess that can apply to uni in general. Either way, still wouldn\u2019t recommend. Find a better residence hall with diverse majors and people.\n\nOverall, comp sci has been a struggle. I wrote a lot, but I can't really tell you much more aside from Freshman Year is hard, especially if you take 211 and 241. You will not have anywhere near as much free time you did in college. And you have to take advantage of Welcome Week and your classes to meet new people, because you won't have much time for events either. Not to say comp sci here is *bad,* but even as a Freshman I can already tell it will be straining, and sometimes unnecessarily challenging\n\nI don't want discourage you, because again it's not really bad here, but take more time to look into IU and its comp sci program yourself. I wish I did so I could have better evaluated my options\n\nSide note: career fair is useless as a Freshman. I had a friend who went, and nobody was interested in him because he was new. He could visibly see their disappointment when he brought up he was a freshman lmao. So if you do come here, I recommend not worrying about all that until your Sophomore Year.",

    "postText": "Hi, I was recently accepted into the Jacobs School of Music, and am strongly considering going there. However, I am a trans woman, so being in a safe and inclusive environment is obviously important to me in the college decision process. From brief research online, it seems IUB is generally a very LGBT friendly place, but Indiana as whole seems to have a lot of potential to become hostile, especially with the current political turmoil nationwide. I am also curious about housing options for trans students and what that would look like; I understand there is a gender inclusive dorm in the central neighborhood, but as a Jacobs student that would be farther from my classes and it would also be nice to be in a dorm with other music students; it would be nice to know what the alternatives are.\n\nAny help or insight would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Hi! I\u2019m a transfem undergrad at iu who started transition part way through college. As others have said, Bloomington is generally a lot better than most of the state with queer acceptance and community. I have faced occasional harassment (drunk frat guys downtown, etc.), but less than in anywhere else I\u2019ve been in Indiana. You will see queer students on campus regularly and will definitely not have issues finding a queer/trans community within the school. Good ways to get in touch with people would be the LGBTQ+ Culture Center, Bloomington Pride (held at the end of August after student move-in), and campus-wide Queer Student Union or school-specific LGBT groups (although I don\u2019t know what exists for Jacobs, sry!). I don\u2019t know if this is relevant for you, but the student health center also has a fantastic gender affirming healthcare program that I really can\u2019t speak highly enough of. At the same time, the administration has shown a serious lack of commitment to preventing/holding students responsible for [transphobic harassment](https://www.idsnews.com/article/2023/01/iu-student-pushes-change-viral-tiktok-harassment-residence-hall-bloomington). \n\nOn the state level, things are not looking great. Most of the anti-trans legislation that\u2019s gained traction here has been targeting minor healthcare and K-12 education, but, as we have seen over the past few years, queerphobic backlash can gain ground at an alarming rate. Personally, I and most of the queer people I know are looking to move elsewhere after college or in the next ~5 years. At the same time, and this may just be me speaking out of spite, I would urge you to not let our awful state legislators deny you a world-class education. I don\u2019t know what other options you are looking at, but Jacobs is supposed to offer phenomenal opportunities for music students.\n\nIn terms of housing, I have heard good things about the Spectrum housing at Teter and, as others have said, there are single rooms available in a couple of nearby dorms. The Spectrum housing is honestly not as far from the Jacobs building as you would think, and the campus bus service is pretty accessible. Collins LLC is also a go-to for a lot of queer students, but that actually is quite far from Jacobs so I don\u2019t know if I would recommend it. \n\nOverall, I would say it is a mixed bag. The student body is pretty overwhelmingly accepting and there is a big city-wide queer community, the iu administration\u2019s problems notwithstanding. The surrounding state leaves a lot to be desired, but I would also focus on your specific needs and goals regarding education. In any case, sorry for the long response and pls pls pls reach out via DM if you have any other questions!",

I\u2019m a gay man and had no issues, but I get that it would still be very different for a trans person. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll get a great opinion on Reddit. There are a few orgs in Bloomington that might give you a better answer.",

Don't let the hick used car salesmen and landlords that write Indiana's laws deny you of the experience of a Jacobs education. But I would follow what they're doing. They may legislate denying you healthcare while you are a student.\n\nWhen you are going through Martinsville, don't stop.",

            "comment": "I'm a trans women who started socially transitioning while in the art program (graduate level) at IUB.\n\nSo far I've personally have been nothing but supported by my cohort, some faculty have been hit and miss but generally positive if not fully informed with how to deal with someone like me. Even the students I teach have generally been fine or neutral with it, some do avoid using my name however.  \n\nOutside of Bloomington Indiana becomes less great and at times I've felt unwelcome or potentially unsafe. (I can effectively boy mode)\n\nFor the laws, they are horrible and sadly nation wide.  Majority target those under the age of 18 (we are at what now, 9 gender affirming care bans for minors? And one attempt at de-transitioning prisoners?) But there has been a push in red states for laws to target those under the age of 25. Often this is just being used as a tactic to move the range of what is acceptable to talk about and to \"compromise\" down to 18.\n\nAs for Indiana specific laws, last time I checked the only 18+ law was a insurance ban on gender affirming care. Hopefully it will be struck down, if not my medicine will rise from 24$ every 3 months to 120$ a month, but many support groups are out there to help if the worst does occur. \n\nThere have been many issues with IU administration not taking harassment of trans students seriously, enough that one recent student &gt;!attempted suicide!&lt; and is now choosing to no longer attend IU. As a grad student I avoid some aspects of dealing with administration and dorm life, but something to be aware of. (I've also heard of some issues even at the spectrum dorm) I did have no-issues changing my name and pronouns through the iu system.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any more specific questions/need any help at iu.",

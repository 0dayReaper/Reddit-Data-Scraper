Final exam was all multiple choices and could answer them very quickly, as there were no tricky questions. The most struggle part was memorizing HR diagram, you need to figure out what type of star is it based on that diagram and difference of the stars based on its type. You really don\u2019t need to draw anything, but just memorize what was emphasized. Other than that, Maybe Lux calculation could be difficult if you failed to understand it.",

I'm unfamiliar this kind of stuff but with the incredible reduction in staff across campus, I cannot imagine that I am the only one stunned by what IU polices this administration simply ignores.",

Even if you show up anonymously some groups are so small that it'd be easy to figure out who someone is.\n\nI want someone to make it happen because it'd provide a real benefit. I don't know how they'd do it relatively safely.",

The only way things change there is it gets bad enough donors notice and stop donating, we start falling in rankings, or we get a new governor and subsequently board of trustees, who are committed to cleaning house.",

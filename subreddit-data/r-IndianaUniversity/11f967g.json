    "postText": "Hey!\n\nI was wondering if anyone has any advice for this situation. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 recently got accepted to a graduate program at IUPUI and I am currently waiting to hear back about my medical school campus placement at IU. I would obviously love if we both were able to end up in Indianapolis. \n\nI was hoping to go through the  Medical Student Education department as they have a system where you can apply to have your situation considered to help influence campus placement. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips for going about this? Have you heard of similar situations and if they have been successful?",

OP's subtle suggestion about managers and executives conveniently upping their own salaries gave me a chuckle.\n\nAnd can we talk about the timing? It's not just interesting, it's kind of mind-blowing that the big jump in manager salaries happened right smack in the middle of COVID. Isn't that when IU put the brakes on annual raises?\n\nSpot on about keeping an eye on the VPs and their direct reports. There's definitely some more digging to be done here.",

                    "comment": "Hey there, your question about the IUPUI split and its implications for IU is an interesting one, though it's a bit off-topic for this thread. It's a complex issue with many facets that might be better discussed in a dedicated post. I encourage you start one.  \n\n\nI appreciate your point about the loss of STEM programs due to the IUPUI split. It's a significant loss, and while the School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering (SICE) is building new programs to fill this void (for instance, the Luddy Center for Artificial Intelligence), it can't be denied that the transition will present challenges.\r  \n\r  \nThat said, I believe that addressing the issues of executive compensation and budget allocation at IU is critical for the success of these new initiatives. For the university to effectively develop and sustain high-quality programs, we need to ensure that resources are being used wisely, not being funneled disproportionately into executive salaries.\r  \n\r  \nThe simultaneous occurrence of program cuts, staff shortages, and significant raises for executives calls for a serious discussion about the university's financial decisions and priorities. We need to demand transparency and accountability from IU leadership and continue to raise awareness about these issues.  \n\n\nIt does raise red flags when those who received substantial salary increases are now the ones overseeing program cuts. We must ask: what are the performance metrics or significant contributions that justify these raises, especially during a time of program reductions?  \n\n\nAn in-depth examination of the roles, responsibilities, and contributions of these executive positions is vital. By understanding what these individuals do for the university on a day-to-day basis, we can better assess whether their compensation matches their impact.  \n\n\nIt's crucial that we increase public scrutiny of executive actions within the university. This doesn't just enhance our understanding of these decisions, but importantly, it holds those in power accountable for their choices.\r  \n\r  \nAlthough President Whitten often bears the brunt of our scrutiny, which is understandable given her role, I believe a more effective approach would be to also closely examine the actions of the Vice Presidents and Associate Vice Presidents who serve under her. It's worth noting that President Whitten inherited many of these executives. Given the historically siloed nature of IU, it's likely that there are numerous questionable practices carried out by these executives that haven't yet been exposed.\r  \n\r  \nWhile the President holds ultimate responsibility, the decisions of these executives often have a more direct impact on staff. I'm of the opinion that it's high time these executives experienced their turn under the microscope.\r  \n\r  \nConsidering the comment by dewberry69420 about facilities workers leaving IU for Catalant, it's true and it's worrying. Historically, IU facilities had low turnover rates, but post-COVID, their workforce has significantly reduced and morale seems to be at an all-time low. The Vice President in charge of facilities isn't an executive hired by President Whitten. Any new management can make the old guard nervous and possibly resentful. Anyone familiar with IU would know how vindictive some executives can be, and it isn't far-fetched to speculate whether some of these executives are padding their retirements at the expense of their departments and students.\r  \n\r  \nI suggest we start by closely examining the leadership of IU facilities, a department that has a major impact on the campus. If IU continues to lose staff and seems uninterested in attracting new talent to keep buildings operational, halls clean, and toilets functional, the university will undoubtedly face further setbacks. This kind of mismanagement could lead to a few executives shamelessly increasing their income before leaving, not having to deal with the fallout they've created.",

The \"management\" category is only including 238 individuals for IU, while that number is much larger for Purdue, Michigan, and Ohio State.  I think it is also worth noting that those 238 probably include administrators in the SOM which further skews the numbers.",

                    "comment": "&gt;Thank you for your constructive criticism. I agree it's important to ensure our analysis is as accurate and fair as possible. Yes, the \"management\" category for IU does include fewer individuals compared to other universities like Purdue, Michigan, and Ohio State. This could indeed impact the overall interpretation of the data.\r  \n\r  \nIn terms of the School of Medicine (SOM) administrators being part of The Chronicle's IU data, that's an interesting point. It's worth noting that neither you nor I can definitively say whether the data includes SOM staff. So, just as I am, you're speculating. If they are indeed included, it might influence the salary figures upwards due to typically higher compensation rates in the medical field. This would need to be considered for a more accurate comparison.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, even with these potential variances, I would argue that the general trend remains concerning and warrants further discussion. The significant increases in executive pay, coupled with cuts to programs and staff shortages, are key issues to be addressed.\r  \n\r  \nI'd like to reiterate that I am not a data expert, and my goal here is not to provide a perfect analysis, but to raise questions and stimulate further examination. If there are inaccuracies in my analysis, I welcome corrections. I encourage others to dig deeper into the data as well to foster a well-rounded conversation about this critical topic.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman CS student and was wondering if there are any courses that could be helpful to get out of the way in the summer. I don\u2019t really know much about summer courses but a lot of people I know in college are already taking a few. If anyone has taken any classes over the summer, what were they and would you recommend it?",

I had a really good professor for calc 3 however, so if you decide to torment yourself you could try that during a normal semester. In general though, get your gen ed's out during the summer, but get your CS stuff done doing spring/fall.",

Firstly, if you want to take astronomy to get your science credits out of the way, go ahead and just do those during the summer. If you're confident in English, ENG-W131 and ENG-L 204 will get your intensive writing and English credits out of the way. If you're simply built different, your 300 level math class can a also be done over the summer, I've heard M301 is easy. But in general, if you don't care about the class (A&amp;H and S&amp;H are usually the ones people don't really care about), and the class is going to be a cakewalk, do it over the summer.",

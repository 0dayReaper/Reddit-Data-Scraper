    "postText": "Hey, i\u2019m wondering if anyone at IU is actively dropshipping and would like to network. It\u2019d be cool to get in touch, share expertise, feedback, and ideas with each other.\n\nI have also been thinking about some options plays to make relatively soon with the current state of the market. If anyone is interested in mapping out some ideas i\u2019m down for that as well. I stay up to date with news to potentially make trades based off big announcements or noticeable social trends, so we could stay in touch for these type of plays too.\n\nFeel free to drop socials, whatever. Also, if you know anyone who does either of these things i\u2019d be grateful for you to reference me to them.",

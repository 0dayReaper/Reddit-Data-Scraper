As for businesses, it should be fine because of the locals, but there aren\u2019t going to be many college students around most likely. \n\nI haven\u2019t been here for summer specifically, but I\u2019ve been here during breaks and it\u2019s pretty empty in terms of college kids.",

            "comment": "Much slower pace and quieter overall in town. I only worked retail as far as customer service goes, but it's a distinctly different and chill vibe in the summer. I always thought it was initially like a breath of fresh air seeing the town empty out and slow down when school let out, and by the middle/end of summer I was ready for all the life and excitement of the students to return. As a young adult living in Bloomington well after I graduated, I never partook in the student-hating mindset some townies cling to, grosses me out quite a bit. Can't imagine Kirkwood not seeing a marked decrease in business, but I can't directly speak to that. Hit up some hikes that end at the lake to swim before the algae gets bad and you're having the quintessential Indiana summer experience you deserve!",

There was no traffic for the most part. Everything was just a little slower and quieter. There are still shows at the Bluebird, but bars quiet down a lot. I absolutely loved it. It's worth doing at least one summer just to experience that side of the town.",

Everything is easier, no covers at the bars, parking is plentiful, awesome weather, and swimming/lake vibes abound. I had a great group of people in my life that also were in town those summers and it made my summers there unforgettable.",

Depending on what restaurant you\u2019re serving at, business could be slow, but if you\u2019re working for a \u201cBloomington staple\u201d like the Irish lion or the Tap, summer is when the locals all come out more often and generally tip better than the student population. I always think of summer as when I was most financially stable because I had more free time to work as well.",

There are obviously a lot fewer students around but summer classes are a thing and there are students to be found if you are looking for that. It's a lot easier to focus if you want to consider picking up a couple classes as well.\n\nTry disc golf if it sounds interesting, Bloomington had a couple cool courses, and they will be wide open in the summer.",

The vibe is more chill, and it feels like you\u2019re playing with house money because your class load is effectively half of what you\u2019re used to in spring/fall. My wife and I (2012 grads) still talk about our summers spent there. \n\nIf I can give any advice from my personal experience, do the first summer session (if you\u2019re in a situation where you can choose one over the other). Session 2 is more of a ghost town. Whereas session 1 has a comfortable population \u2014 i.e., you can always find parking but KOK/sports are still just rowdy enough except with half the amount of people on a typical Tuesday. I\u2019m actually very envious of your predicament now that I\u2019m thinking back. Man, what a time to be alive. Pour one out for me.",

I worked at a restaurant off campus and didn\u2019t notice business really slow. But if I was on Kirkwood I imagine it would be different. Getting into bars was much easier. The town just felt slower. \n\nI remember Brothers had $0.50 Rolling Rocks and would play movies on Mondays in the summer.\nOverall I highly recommend it. Bloomington summers were so much fun. \n\nThere were enough people there that you could always find something to do but it was just less crowded.",

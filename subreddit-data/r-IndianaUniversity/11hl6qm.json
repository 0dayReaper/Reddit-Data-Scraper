    "postText": "Hello all! Does anyone here know anything about the MA programs at the Folklore Institute? I applied to the MA in Folklore + Arts Administration, but I wanted to get some feedback from those who have experience with the program before deciding to pursue it. I've seen some mixed opinions about the grad experience at IU in general (mainly that compensation/benefits for AI/GA's suck, and that the university doesn't offer livable stipends). What's been folk's experience with the Folklore or Ethnomusicology MA? Does the program provide good training/preparation/opportunities career-wise? General pros, cons, opinions on the Folklore + Ethnomusicology department/grad program?",

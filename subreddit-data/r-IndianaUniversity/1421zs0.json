    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI am an incoming DA to Kelley for the class of '27 and will be a Finance major. I am attending NSO next week, and had questions regarding course selection.\n\nWhat courses are recommended that I should take for my first-semester schedule at IU to put me on a good track? Is there advice you can give me about this, and how would a sample schedule for a Semester 1 Finance major look like?\n\nAlso, any general advice that I should have going into NSO? Thank You!!",

You don\u2019t take classes for your respective major until you\u2019ve taken most of these classes. As well as I-CORE. \n\nLink to all the requirements: https://bulletin.kelley.iu.edu/Undergrad/Degree?_gl=1*1aj8fcv*_ga*NTA4Mjk4NDAuMTY4NjAyMzUzNg..*_ga_61CH0D2DQW*MTY4NjAyMzUzNi4xLjEuMTY4NjAyMzk0My4yOS4wLjA.\n\niGPS will help you map out your classes: https://one.iu.edu/task/iu/igps-plan?_gl=1*sdyjrr*_ga*NTA4Mjk4NDAuMTY4NjAyMzUzNg..*_ga_61CH0D2DQW*MTY4NjAyMzUzNi4xLjEuMTY4NjAyMzk0OS4yMy4wLjA.\n\n\nGeneral rule of thumb, 15 credits a semester will more or less get you through college if you only have one major.",

Business presentations is a lot of public speaking, with some research/preparation during your own time. Either semester works. English W 131 I didn\u2019t have to take because my SAT score was high, but if you have to take it I recommend taking it in a separate semester of Business presentations. Kelley Compass (for years 1-3) is just busy work that helps you prepare for resumes, cover letters, interviews etc. Take it during whichever semester you have less classes freshman year. \n\n^These are all your I-core pre reqs you should take freshman year. You also have your IU Gen ed requirements that you have to fulfill, so just add those classes on for each semester for your first two years. I can recommend some of the classes I took as well as professors (for both gen ed and  and i core pre reqs).",

We weren't allowed to add on Accounting or business presentations for example if we were assigned k201 and compass for that semester. That being said, I may be wrong, so definitely reach out to an advisor or check the website.",

            "comment": "&gt; As the campus-wide work stoppage persisted into fall, gaining faculty and community support, the IU administration began promising a number of costly changes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Graduate workers are now paid a minimum stipend of $22,000, a substantial increase from the previous minimum of $15,000 at the beginning of the fall 2021 semester. In addition to this raise, graduate workers no longer have to pay $1,435 in mandatory fees or any course-specific fees in graduate programs.\n&gt; \n&gt; These concessions have come with consequences \u2014 but what those look like exactly, the university doesn't want to say.\n&gt; \n&gt; Last August, Shrivastav said millions of dollars would likely need to be diverted to cover the increase. While this first year has been covered by short-term cost reductions in the current budget, such as delaying IT improvement expenses and limiting non-essential business travel, Shrivastav claimed a long-term solution was still being discussed. Now, months later, the administration still won't release any specific information on how IU will fund these changes, despite repeated inquiries from the H-T.\n\n...\n\n&gt; Several graduate students are alleging the administration has not properly funded several departments to cover these promises, leading to graduate worker positions being eliminated and Ph.D. programs being downsized.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"We know the university has the money it could give it to the departments. The college could give it to the departments. So why are they not? It seems like it's just to punish us for going on strike,\u201d Meisinger said.\n&gt; \n&gt; A lot of people like Meisinger, a fifth-year journalism Ph.D. student, went on strike for a better paying position at the university. Now, next fall, he won't have a position at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"I mean, I know (the administration) knew full well that they weren't going to fund departments anymore to pay for these raises. So, like, where does that money have to come from? Well, it still has to come from grad students in some way.\"\n\n...\n\n&gt; While her four-year SAA contract was set to expire this spring, it wasn't something she'd been worried about. Throughout her time at IU, Lin said she had been well-assured that students often get another appointment.\n&gt; \n&gt; But then news broke \u2014 first, at an informal pizza party, later spreading like wildfire across her cohort. Administrators within the Media School's graduate program began telling students that at least 15 SAA lines were going to be cut next year in order to fund the mandatory stipend increase.\n\n...\n\n&gt; When The Herald-Times asked whether the reports of eliminating positions were true, the administration would not confirm or deny they had made the announcement. When the topic was raised at a recent town hall, Potter did acknowledge it.\n\n...\n\n&gt; Since her graduate worker job is her main source of income, as well as her health insurance coverage, Lin began to spiral.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"I couldn't sleep actually after I heard about the funding cut for a lot of days. I, like, almost had a panic attack,\" Lin said. \"I thought about, 'So, if we don't have any kind of SAA positions on campus, what's the point for us to live in Bloomington, right?' Because we can\u2019t afford to pay rent.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; The obvious alternative for graduate students is to take a part-time, off-campus job, but this isn't possible for international students, like Lin and Yuqian Ni, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in communication science.\n\n...\n\n&gt; Due to [a] last-minute reversal, Ni and Lin will now have an SAA position for the upcoming academic year, but as Potter mentions in the offer letter, \"(this) will, however, be the last SAA package funded by the school that you should count on.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; The package comes at a cost to the school, Potter wrote. The deans have decided to tap into funds IU expects all schools to keep on hand for \"emergency financial disruptions,\" according to Potter.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Second, I will be reducing the number of offers advanced to waitlisted doctoral students for the coming academic year should students on the priority admission list decline the offers they received. In essence, we will limit the size of the incoming doctoral class \u2014 and then deal with the financial implications of that decision.\n\n...\n\n&gt; Graduate students say they don't place the blame on specific department heads, program directors or graduate school representatives. Instead, it seems their hands have been tied because they were not allocated additional funding to cover the higher pay. In order to meet the mandatory requirement , lower level administrators have had to refigure their limited budget. As Potter himself notes, this, unfortunately, comes with costs.\n\n...\n\n&gt; After making big, sweeping promises to improve the graduate student experience, the administration has remained tight-lipped about how it will financially support this multi-million dollar promise. Repeatedly, the H-T asked the communications team at IU whether any additional funding was allocated to the Media School for its SAA budget. That question went unanswered.\n\n...\n\n&gt; Roskos said he believes IU is trying the \"divide and conquer\" method, staggering the announcements and keeping them informal.\n&gt; \n&gt; When asked whether this action might prompt another strike, many graduate students seemed in favor of some recourse.\n&gt; \n&gt; While Meisinger notes a movement's momentum can fade with time and concessions, \u201cit does seem that nobody's doing a better job of organizing us than the university.\"",

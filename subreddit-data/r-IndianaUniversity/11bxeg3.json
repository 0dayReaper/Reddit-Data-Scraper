I\u2019ve had a hard time finding close friends, only made acquaintances, the last two years, \nEven the people I know dont wanna get out if their damn bed. So if anybody wants to join me hmu, I\u2019m pretty chill, So if you wanna grab some food or try a new cafe let me now \u270c\ufe0f\n\n(Throwaway cus I don\u2019t want my roomate to see this)",

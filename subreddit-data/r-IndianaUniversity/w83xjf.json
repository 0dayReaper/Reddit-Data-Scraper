It\u2019s not hard, it\u2019s a great major for a capitalist society, and you get to play safe (for the most part) ~a Kelley DA who transferred after I wanted more from my education. While I agree Kelley is a great school, that doesn\u2019t mean y\u2019all aren\u2019t the weakest links. This may be anecdotal and I\u2019ll admit that but every racist/womanizer I\u2019ve encountered here have been in Kelley. The same can be said for many others. Again this IS an generalization and is not actual evidence I\u2019m just stating a lot of peoples impression of Kelley kids. I would love for some sociology students to do a survey and study on y\u2019all because you are truly a different breed.",

The 4.0 GPA student went on to get a PhD and became a professor at a prestigious university. The 3.0 student was hired at a big company as an engineer. The 2.0 student flunked out of the program, transferred to the business school, and used his connections to become an executive at the company that the 3.0 student works for and funds the 4.0 student's research.",

    "postText": "Hey guys!\n\nI received an offer from IU on 16th December, and the website says I will be notified in 4-6 weeks of my admission to KSB. Well, I know that there is still a week-ish left, but still, a bit scared that I haven't heard back yet (although I meet the requirements). And apparently, they don't notify students if they haven't gotten in?? So I am pretty anxious. So for people who got into KSB... I have a few questions:\n\n1. If you applied through Common app, your portal says Business Exploratory BSB, right?\n2. How long did it take for you to hear back from Kelley?\n\nThank you guys!",

    "postText": "I'm only four weeks into my classes and I'm already dreading going to every zoom call. I only have one in person class and the amount of soical interaction I get with other students is so low. I'm happy the school is taking covid seriously but I feel the mental health of most people is going down. I've joined two clubs which I do enjoy, but it's a shame I can't experience all IU has to offer. My grades are taking a huge hit as well as my self worth/mental health. Sorry if it seems like I'm just complaining but hopefully some of you guys relate.",

            "comment": "I totally relate and was already feeling this way at the same point last semester.  One thing that I\u2019ve done this semester is find things that I find interesting but don\u2019t involve me looking at a screen, since I\u2019m already online for school all day.  I still check social media and watch Netflix occasionally, but I\u2019m taking a break from video games this semester.  This exact approach might not be right for you if you get your social interaction from video games (I mostly play single player games), but reducing screen time in other areas is good.  \n\nAlong with that, I just try to make things simple and focus on little things I can do to improve myself.  Better Ideas on YouTube has a lot of good thoughts about this.  \n\nNot going to lie, it\u2019s still hard and I feel isolated at times, but these things have helped me to be more productive and stay with things",

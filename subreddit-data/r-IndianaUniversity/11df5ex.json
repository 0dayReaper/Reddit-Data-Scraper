    "postText": "Greetings everyone, we've been seeing a lot of common questions from students admitted to IU\u2014congrats, Hoosiers!\n\nHere's some information that can be helpful as you move through the rest of the process:\n\n1. Admitted students should **reserve their space by May 1** by completing the intent to enroll form at [intenttoenroll.indiana.edu](https://intenttoenroll.indiana.edu/?utm_campaign=adms-2022-2023-yield&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=intent-to-enroll).\n2. There are a few options for visiting campus, like [Red Carpet Day](https://admissions.indiana.edu/events/red-carpet-days/registration.html?utm_campaign=adms-2022-2023-yield&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=rcd) or a virtual admitted student event (hosted by the Office of Admissions) or a Direct Admit day, hosted by your school. They aren't mandatory, but they are fun and a good way to learn more about IU. You can attend just one or all if you like\u2014it's whatever is convenient and helpful to you.\n3. Scholarship and financial aid information has started to go out, so check your email (and spam folder) and mailbox. If you didn't receive scholarship funding directly from IU, you can still look at outside scholarships\u2014there are a lot listed on the [IU Scholarships Future Scholars](https://scholarships.indiana.edu/future-scholars/non-iu-scholarships.html?utm_campaign=adms-2022-2023-yield&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=scholarships) page.\n4. Remember, there are tons of majors and they all lead to a great education and an IU degree. If you aren't sure what you want to major in yet or want other options to consider (or want a second major), take a look at all the options IU offers.\n\nMake sure to check out the other [pinned post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/101odk5/%E2%84%B9_new_here_read_this_post/) for historically important information.  Thanks again and Go Hoosiers!",

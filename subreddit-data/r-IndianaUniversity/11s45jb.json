    "postText": "UPDATE: THE ADMISSIONS REP NEVER ADDED HER MATH CLASS!!!!!\n\nDaughter applied when applications opened. She was missing a math class and is now taking said class. Admissions said she would have a decision within 2 weeks, as she still qualified for early decision. That was months ago. We have both followed up and keep getting the run around. Anyone else having this issue? Today is the deadline and no answer.",

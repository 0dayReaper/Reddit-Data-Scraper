    "postText": "My daughter is an incoming freshman assigned to Teter\u2026don\u2019t know which building but Hutton floor so likely Boisen .  We went on BedLoft and only see 2 options - standard bunk or L shaped bunk.  I thought someone mentioned that their bed was Captain style which is like 3\u2019 from floor.  Anyone know if this is possible? Per website not an option.\n\nWe may have to go with risers because daughter doesn\u2019t want any bunk configuration.  Any info appreciated.",

If anyone knows if beds can be half -lofted that is the question.\n\nBTW\u2014this is my 3rd offspring to go thru college (not IU) so been there /done that on much of college stuff....including my own college years.  So if you have some direct experience to answer Question then thanks ...if not save the sass for someone else. \u262e\ufe0f",

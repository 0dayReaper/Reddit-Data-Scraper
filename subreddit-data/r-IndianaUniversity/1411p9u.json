Beyond the basics like going out in daylight and not going anywhere where there aren't many people, should I have safety concerns/make a more careful run/walk safety plan? Thanks!",

It doesn\u2019t happen monthly or anything like that, but multiple women have gone missing in the decade that I\u2019ve lived here, some never to be seen again. There is occasionally a shooting or stabbing in town, although all the ones I can remember were targeted, not against a random passerby. \n\nI don\u2019t think you have to do anything special for safety beyond not running at night and being a little picky about the areas where you run. I do not think pepper spray is a necessary daily accessory, but it\u2019s probably not a bad idea if you\u2019re going to be out late at night and need to walk home or to your car alone. Better yet, just don\u2019t walk alone late at night.",

Other than that there are a few crazy homeless people but it's no where near as dangerous as a big city like Chicago. If you know where to look you can find some sketchy places but overall there is very little chance you'll just randomly find yourself there unless you go looking for it.",

Downtown will have homeless people but just keep your head down and don\u2019t talk to them and they won\u2019t bother you. In the evening and at night going around downtown and along the edges of campus/by college mall can have a couple crazies who like to talk but I\u2019ve not experienced any actual dangerous people yet at these times. \n\nBut I\u2019m also male and we had a female assaulted just last year in a parking garage downtown at night.\n\nSo definitely carry something for personal protection at night if female and alone, as it\u2019s more so the crowds that keep you safe then anything during the day. \n\nMornings are completely fine I\u2019ve never had issues in the morning with any homeless people or other civilians. We do have very bad drivers though so be aware of surroundings when stepping off the sidewalks and onto the roads.",

I ALWAYS ran with pepper spray as well as a little knife ring (goguarded) if I was by myself but tried to run with friends as much as I could. Generally I'd park at Hopscotch and run north to clear creek. I always felt safer after I got through rail trail and onto clear creek...however, our car was broken into at clear creek trailhead so just beforewarned. Another one of my favorite places to run is Kerr Creek road for long runs, you can park at Bruster's. Running around campus is a good 5 mile loop that I always felt safe on as well. For me, it was the homeless people that made me feel the most unsafe. I never ran at night.",

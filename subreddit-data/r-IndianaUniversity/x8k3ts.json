Students can't go to classes, and grad students and professors can't teach if the lights are not on, there's no running water, and the buildings are not clean and safe to be in. Just like undergrad students can't take classes and graduate if there are no T.As to run the labs, and teach, while professors conduct research and teach other core classes. Both are vitally important to the university ecosystem. Education does come first, but education can't happen without the staff who make sure education can come first for the undergrad students, graduate students, professors, and administrators. That's why I hope us staff, and the grad students can collaborate together so both of us can advocate for higher wages.",

He was a relentless academic workaholic who wanted nothing but the best for this institution. Whitten berates the very same employees, times secretaries on their speed of note taking, and provides 0 constructive feedback when talking to leadership. \n\nThere is a reason we are having a massive flight in leadership, potential faculty votes of no confidence, and general dissent. It\u2019s because plain and simple, she\u2019s an incompetent president and is really nasty in person. She is almost psychopathic with the way she treats the people under her. \n\nThe even sadder truth is that the majority of our trustees are senile, don\u2019t care, or have singular focuses on athletics. They are already preparing to campaign against her.\n\nI work with plenty of people around her and I\u2019ve personally interacted with her. This is the truth.",

If that\u2019s all she wants to do then she\u2019s in the wrong position.\n\nA president shouldn\u2019t only be engaging with students and throwing Hot Dogs. She hasn\u2019t done any meaningful academic initiatives since arriving. She is literally out of her element. If you\u2019re happy with a president that only smiles and shakes hands then you have low expectations of a leader. \n\nMcRobbie met with students regularly and visited global alumni chapters all the time. You\u2019re simply falling for her warm motherly persona propaganda.",

As do &gt;90% of those that interact with her (that\u2019s an underestimate because it unscientific and there was one person that told me they thought she was \u201cdoing the job the BoT expected her to do\u201d so it\u2019s unfair to bitch about her leadership \u201cstyle\u201d.

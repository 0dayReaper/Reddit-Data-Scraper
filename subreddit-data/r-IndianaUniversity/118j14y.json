    "postText": "This is going to sound crazy ridiculous. Maybe the most ridiculous thing you'll ever read. (I'm a ridiculous man). But, I was wondering where someone, who already graduated, might go to get their graduation (With cap and gown) headshot done. I was part of the class of 2020 and I left Bloomington early, so I wasn't able to get any pics with a cap or gown. As a matter of fact, I do not have a cap or gown. I'll be in Bloomington later this spring and wanted to know if there is someway I can get a headshot there. Thanks.",

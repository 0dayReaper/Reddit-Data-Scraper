The dorms aren\u2019t amazing, but most of them aren\u2019t that bad either (it can provide for some bonding experiences too lol). Also \u201conly a mile\u201d doesn\u2019t sound that bad now, but at 7:30am mid semester in 15 degree F weather, you might regret the decision. There is a bus system, but I\u2019ve never really trusted it to get around personally. I would recommend reaching out to rps if you want to still ask about tulip tree though, because truthfully I\u2019m not sure - just giving my experience!",

If you really don\u2019t want to live in them though then you can live at union street. But yeah I lived in Read and found a great group of friends from it. - also you\u2019re not able to choose where you live. I requested northwest and put Mcnutt in the comments but got southeast. So don\u2019t go in expecting to live somewhere.",

Personally I would say go for northwest neighborhood enhanced if it\u2019s in your budget. Especially since you are Kelley it\u2019s right next door pretty much.",

It is a unique sort of place and is centrally located. Briscoe and McNutt are a ways out, but if you were planning on taking Business classes, they might not be a bad choice.\n\nI think Wells is 10K for the year, but that doesn't include food probably. Chances are you will only be in the dorms for one year, so if you don't end up getting the best match for you, I wouldn't worry about it too much.",

As so many others have said there are Positives and negatives to dorms lie everything in life but honestly they aren\u2019t bad and do actually help with getting to know people etc you can live in tulip tree your sophomore year though.  Affordability wise honeslt weirdly Read ended up being a blessing. Love the way they are set up despite being older. There are way more options for how to arrange and stack the furniture to make the rooms \u201cbigger\u201d. Requested an LLC in a different quadrant got Read and not the LLC but it\u2019s been good!

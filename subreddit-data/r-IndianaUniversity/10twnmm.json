They played exceptionally well.\n\nIndiana and Purdue seemed to handle it, on both sides, with quite a high level of sportsmanship within the rivalry.  As a Hoosier I always root for Purdue if/when Indiana in not involved.\n\nWant to see stupid insane?  Go live in Columbus Ohio for 12 years.  As a Hoosier.  See how they are the insane explosive-vest jihaad against Michigan, while Michigan doesn't really even think of them at all.",

It might advantage you to take 3-4 summer classes the summer after ur freshman year (finite math through ivy tech is a big one) so that you can break up the pace of the work over a longer period of time. Managerial and financial accounting can be taken over the summer, as can courses like Econ 2, stats, d270/271, etc. I\u2019d strongly recommend taking finite through ivy tech. This is all contingent on you being willing and able to pay for these courses, which are typically around $3,000 each. This would be the best possible strategy to ensure a high GPA at a manageable workload.",

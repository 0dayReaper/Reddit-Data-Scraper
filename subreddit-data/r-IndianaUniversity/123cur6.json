    "postText": "I am narrowing down my school selection to two schools- IU Kelley and TAMU Mays. Kelley is ranked better for business than Mays and seems to have better outcomes too. However, going to a&amp;m means I will be saving 25k a year. Is it really worth the 100k extra in student tuition after the four years of undergraduate?",

            "comment": "No, it's not.  I am a Kelley grad (undergrad and MBA).  It's a great school/program.  However, you're going to get the same education just about anywhere.  The difference is only in network effects (and that applies to just about any college choice).  I work for one of the Big 4 firms and I have colleagues from just about every school around.  I don't have the numbers, but go look on LinkedIn if you want some evidence.  Work hard and make connections, and you'll do well wherever you go.  If it helps, I am giving my son the same advice.\n\nEdit: I was an experienced hire at said Big 4.  Undergrad interviews with Big 6 (at that time) were unsuccessful for a number of reasons, i.e. lack of maturity and mediocre grades, primarily.  The point being, where you end up in a career has much more to do with you, than where you go to school.",

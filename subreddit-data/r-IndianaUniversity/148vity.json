    "postText": "Hi IU Reddit community!!\n\nAre there any alternatives to fulfill the prerequisite for INFO-201 Mathematical Foundations of Informatics for informatics majors in Luddy without having to take MATH-M 118 (Finite Math) or a similar course? I'm curious if there are any other pathways or substitutions available that would satisfy the requirement for INFO-201 without the need for a finite math course.\n\nThanks !!",

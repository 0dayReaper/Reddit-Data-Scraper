    "postText": "In need of Employment Based Foundation Practicum for my MSW program at IUPUI. Can I use my current work duties and schedule to satisfy my foundation practicum? If not, what about my work duties/schedule needs to change to make this happen? \n\nCan provide additional details on work duties and schedule if need be! Just want to know if my practicum hours/activities are allowed to coincide with my work hours/activities for my foundation (SWK 555: Practicum I) practicum. Practically impossible to complete my practicum hours separate from my work hours due to schedule constraints!",

My work, however, needs these conversations to occur now so that we know what my future at this company will look like, so I was seeing if anyone else has gone through this process before.",

            "comment": "TLDR; There are a lot of pieces that need to fall into place. Don't get too ahead of yourself on this. \n\nLike other's have said, you really need to talk to your field coordinator about this as there is some nuance to solidifying an employment placed practicum. Generally though, you do have to have tasks unrelated to your standard work duties that can count toward practicum hours which would likely translate to more hours at work per week. You should also know, you do have to file a petition to complete an employment based practicum and they can deny employment based practicum petitions for a multitude of reasons. Its definitely possible, many people do it, but just be aware it may not be approved. \n\nTypically for 555 they won't have you work with the field coordinator for 555 placement until mid-fall semester, so just try to be patient with the process (it can be frustrating). There are also other options for completing your practicum around work and class schedules. For instance, I deferred 555 to the summer when my class schedule was lighter so that I could do practicum on opposite days from work. Unless this has changed recently, I believe you can also stretch the hours over a longer period so rather than finishing 300 hours in 1 semester, you can stretch it through the spring and summer. \n\nIt'll work out! Take a breath, this doesn't have to be worked out for several months.",

I appreciate the insight- deferring to the summer or stretching it out between the spring and summer semesters is really smart.",

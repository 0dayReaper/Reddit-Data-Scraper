The department head just sent out an email to everyone in spanish/portuguese classes that they'll be adjusting the remaining assignments and final to not include material that won't be covered while the students are stirking. They didn't specifically say that classes were cancelled, but the grad students definitely won't be teaching (in this department at least). \n\nNot sure what the other departments are doing because this is the only email I've gotten so far. I'm interested to see how the science departments handle the lab sections though, but I haven't recieved any emails from my classes like that yet. Each department might handle things a little differently, so this is all the info I have rn.",

But, we shall see. There's a lot of interesting things to be learned about what happened with the UC Santa Cruz strike and how the administration will deal with strikers.",

                                    "comment": "The strike is starting at the end of the semester. There's basically two paychecks left in the main school year (end of April and early May). It probably won't affect those because it would take time to go through the process to track the students down, go through formal discipline, etc. Generally, it seems as though faculty won't help admin with that process so we can expect it to take a while.\n\nThe risk is getting fired for not \"performing duties\" or whatever and then not getting hired in the fall (or perhaps the summer for some). In that case, there would be no stipend or tuition remission. The admin is going to have all summer to track students down.\n\nAs for cards held, a great many classes are either taught solely by grad students or grad students do grading and other duties (office hours, run a lab portion of the class, etc.) Right now, because it's the end of the semester, the grad students could withhold submitting final grades for the class and otherwise not teach for the rest of the semester. This happened in other strikes, such as UC Santa Cruz, and might put some pressure on the administration but we can see that they're trying to change the narrative so people blame the grad students for it rather than the admin.\n\nHowever, faculty are generally in charge of the classes (even if taught by grad students) and we can see that the administration is putting pressure on faculty to come up with a solution to submit grades even in the event of a strike so that the strike is not a big disruption. What will the faculty do with admin pressure on them? It remains to be seen.\n\nSo, I would argue that a strike that affects a longer period of the semester will be more effective because, while there might be a way for IU to get most/all of the grades submitted for this semester, there's just no way they can teach an entire semester of classes without grad students due to the sheer amount of classes.\n\nI think the strike will work if it lasts long enough, but they're going to try to break it by tracking down enough students and firing them as they did with UC Santa Cruz and see if the prospect of not getting tuition remission/stipend for the Fall discourages the rest of the strikers.",

(https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forum/off-topic/michigan-lsa-econ-vs-iu-kelley)\n\nIf you want to work on Wall Street, I would shoot for Ross internal-transfer and grind my way through the process at mich. Kelley is a good school but you can be better off at a school like umich than Kelley for Wall Street. Umich has the prestige and more resources compared to Kelley for something like that.",

There\u2019s still so many great opportunities with an Econ degree and a lot of them seem to be parallel to what you would get from Ross. If you have any other questions about umich feel free to pm me :)",

Kelley is a school where you get out what you put in (most of the time). if you think you can be competitive and truly have the drive and desire to succeed, then i think the cheaper cost is worth it, but mich is a safer option and has plenty of opportunities outside of ross. i would visit both and talk to people who go to both and base your decision off of what school you vibe with more and would have a better experience at.",

Im fortunate enough that my parents are willing to pay for my education so I won\u2019t take up any debt. But I feel pretty guilty making them pay 70k a year for an undergrad degree. \nAnd as u said Umich is not known for giving out academic scholarships so I\u2019m not expecting a cent from them.",

And i believe finance can be learned along the way whereas econ is like learning the science of finance. Either way both are great subjects. That\u2019s all I got if you\u2019re trynna convince yourself to go for IU. I mean I\u2019m kinda in the same boat as you lol.",

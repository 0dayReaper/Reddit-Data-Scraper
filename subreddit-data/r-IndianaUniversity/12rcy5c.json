Looking on the website for the audition stuff, it might be cool to get a few musicians together, record one of your pieces, and you do some production on it. Tbh I\u2019ll admit, I don\u2019t know much about the specifics, as majority of things I do is pertaining to the oboe, but that would probably be really cool and help you stand out a bit. I think you can also use other stuff too, like recordings from the past etc. \n\nAlso here\u2019s the website I used: https://music.indiana.edu/admissions/auditions/audio-engineering.html\n\nIf you have any other questions about Jacobs (I can try to answer specifics haha, but I can definitely answer general questions), feel free to dm me or something.",

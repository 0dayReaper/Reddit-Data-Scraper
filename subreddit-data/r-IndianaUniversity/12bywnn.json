There, the pedestrian traffic shares the intersection with traffic safely. The unregulated pedestrian traffic crossing from SPEA to the library causes a gridlock that absolutely does not need to exist. When I sit there in a bus with up to 70 students aboard that need to get to class, I just shake my head.",

There are already elevated places to connect to on either side it would have been relatively easy. Plus it would have made more covered pathways to traverse across campus on rainy or snowy days. Huge opportunity missed. \n\nBut in the grand scheme of things it's not too bad. It backs up for like 30 minutes and disappears just as quickly. Mild inconvenience at most but if you know to avoid the busy times like the 2:30 rush you can get through the area pretty well most of the time.",

The crosswalk at the library and the 'alley' on 7th (caused by the bike highway) are both situations like that and both were designed by the City of Bloomington. I have no doubt that the ambulance drivers detour both regularly.",

There are traffic lights on Fee Lane or Eagleson Ave, both within 100 feet, where pedestrians can cross to the other side and it not having to unnaturally stop traffic. I like the idea of having more crosswalks for pedestrians but that place is just terrible for one when you have hundreds of kids trying to cross all at different times and you have each car waiting over a min trying to find an opportunity to get through.",

That pedestrian crossing gets such a huge pass from the business/SPEA people because it's super convenient but there're two intersections not more than 100 meters on either side and traffic backs all the way across them constantly. Heck I've actually managed on occasion to walk from Luddy to Wells faster than a Bloomington transit bus has covered the same distance.",

I'm a few courses off a degree I started in Australia a decade ago, and am thinking of going back and finishing someday, just because I don't like having the incomplete (I don't need it for work or anything, but it is unfinished business in my life).  Thanks for being a good example with your story!",

That lingering inter on the to-do list will get ya.\n\nMy career path didn\u2019t require it either... but when I wanted to make a pivot in work, it became vital. An arguably bigger reason was that my parents sacrificed a lot for me to go &amp; as I started looking into it, all I could think about was hanging that paper on their wall\u2026 and a copy for mine\u2026 and one to keep in the car, lol.\n\nA good thing to bare in mind is that COVID changed everything in Uni.

I sincerely wish I\u2019d had this attitude when I was originally there. \n\nAs an adult, I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge, the experience, and even discovered I\u2019m a bit of a nerd for Voting &amp; Game theory. I will oddly miss it, but my grade was just posted and I\u2019ve never been so proud of an 88% B+ in my life.\n\nTo any adults out there considering going back. You will likely surprise yourself. You\u2019re probably a lot smarter/more capable than you give yourself credit for, and if you were accepted into IU to begin with\u2026 you absolutely got this!",

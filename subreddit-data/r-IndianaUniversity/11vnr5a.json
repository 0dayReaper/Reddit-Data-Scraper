    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am trying to decide if I will attend IU for the PhD in epidemiology program. Are there any past or current students here? I previously posted here, but now I\u2019ve received my acceptance! I\u2019ve asked my potential advisor to connect me with some students, but he\u2019s new as well. \n\nAlso, what are some good questions to ask your advisor to help with the decision? \n\nAlso this is the only school I applied to this year, so the question is if I\u2019ll start a PhD this year at all; there\u2019s no other schools in the picture. \n\nThanks!",

The stipend is okay but you'll definitely be worried about any major unexpected expenses.\n\nThe epi program is pretty diverse but don't have high expectations for a super social group outside of your lab.",

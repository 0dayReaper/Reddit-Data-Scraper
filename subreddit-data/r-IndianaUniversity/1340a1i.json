If that's what you want, you should go with standard with AC.\n\nHowever, it's quite likely that you'll have a roommate, or even two or three. Lots of the enhanced dorms (the biggest being Union Street Center) are more like apartments. My freshman year, I was in a four bedroom apartment in Union Street with three other roommates. We shared a kitchen, two bathrooms, and a living space, but we all had our own bedrooms.",

My friend did Russian flagship and I know people who did Chinese flagship. If you\u2019re willing to put in the work they\u2019re great, but you will be doing massive amounts of language learning in short amounts of time as part of the program.",

Can\u2019t speak for the Arabic and Russian programs, but all of my professors and AI\u2019s were so amazing at their jobs. You also have a lot more opportunities for getting scholarships/funding for studying abroad!",

    "postText": "Now that I\u2019m graduating this weekend, I figured it\u2019s time to share my \u201csecret\u201d parking spots. \n\nFor those of you who can\u2019t afford a parking pass, or maybe only have class 2-3 days a week and don\u2019t *want* to buy a parking pass, this is for you. \n\nFor the entirety of this past semester, I have parked on the curb and all along E 20th street (the street with the rickety apartments, few blocks down from evolve) without paying anything. \n\nI\u2019ve not been ticketed, towed, questioned, etc. haven\u2019t paid a cent. It\u2019s like a 3 minute walk to the stadium bus stop too, so essentially like parking at the stadium anyway. \n\nI also used to live in one of those apartments, and know for certainty that the spaces all along E 20th are in fact public parking spots. So long as you\u2019re not on a yellow curb or in a designated apartment lot, you\u2019re solid. \n\nHope this helps, GO TO CLASS but also save your money, parking pass prices are ridiculous.",

I rarely see more than 3-4 other cars there, which is frankly astonishing.",

It's hard if you're in the dorms, but I do know a freshman who managed to pull it off.",

I had a dual sport and it was so fun to ride all over campus on that thing.  Plus, bikes are generally cheaper than cars and get great mileage which is a bonus.\n\nIn terms of car parking, another option I haven\u2019t seen mentioned here is parking at College Mall. There are spots right by the bus stop that are rarely filled so you can sit in your car and watch for the bus which is nice.",

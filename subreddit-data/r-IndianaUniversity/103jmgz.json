    "postText": "Hey fellow IU community, I have a (senior) friend who\u2019s claiming that the pictures for the IU yearbook are a ripoff for the price and plans on skipping getting it. I\u2019m trying to understand his position, but also get him to consider the drawbacks on it. I don\u2019t have many good points though, mostly that he\u2019ll regret it if he doesn\u2019t.\n\nWhat good points could I use to tell him? And for those that have it or skipped it, what drawbacks could you see to getting the yearbook picture so that I can better understand his view?",

I\u2019m not even sure if people care much about high school. \n\nI\u2019m usually very sentimental but yearbooks are a joke. You pay a ridiculous rate so that you can look at the book like 3 times in your life, just doesn\u2019t seem worthwhile to me. I lived my college career, I have those memories and I have pictures with the people I cared about, not some posed picture that has no meaning.",

Have lugged them around for years, looked at them maybe twice and can identify almost no one in there.  I'm guessing for most people, it's not really going to be worth it, especially after 5-10 years.",

I spoke to some current students as well as did some research by watching their standard admit webinar and talking to their counselors and according to my understanding, it is not that difficult. Only one or two classes feel difficult for the students but it's quite manageable. You just need to stay consistent and put a little extra effort. If you feel confident, I'd say go for it but again it depends on your other options.",

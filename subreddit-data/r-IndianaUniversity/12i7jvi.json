    "postText": "so i got into both ui chicago and iu bloomington for biology and i am planning to go to med school and follow the pre med track for the next four years. i am a high school senior and these 2 schools are both out of state, however are all decent for biology. my brother lives close to chicago, meaning i would live with him and commute around 30 minutes everyday, saving expenses on dorms and having the comfort of a home, however i would also love the college experience before i shove my face harder into textbooks for another 4 years after. both uic and iu bloomington have good medical schools, and i've heard that uic is close to one of the largest medical sectors in the nation and has many open doors for opportunities, but i feel like i could get the same thing at bloomington, but i am still not sure since it's a very suburban college town in the middle of indiana... i got direct admission to the college at bloomington but also got a scholarship for around 30k at chicago. if anybody knows if there's tremendous grade deflation at any of these schools (or inflation \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc) and the opportunities and what you would choose if in my shoes, please help a confused kid out. i would like to also build a strong portfolio (research, experience, HIGH GPA ) thank you!",

UIC seems to have a edge based on opportunities for pre-med, but IUB also has very good resources for me as well.",

Is IUB worth 40k more? I am not sure. It looks like UIC has a medical school on campus, so it is easily walkable if you are looking for medicine related research opportunities. At IUB, the med campus is at Indy which is 1 hr away and research they do at the campus arent medicine related (for the most part, i may be wrong aside from say cancer)",

I\u2019m from a Chicago suburb so I\u2019ve known a lot of people going to UIC and not a lot of people like it, there\u2019s certainly some that do but also a lot of stories of people transferring out to places like u of I. Commuting will make what is already a slow social scene worse, and staying in the dorms won\u2019t be too much better because a large amount of the students there commute anyway. \nWhether a college experience and social scene is worth the significantly more money is up to you.",

What are your current thoughts on this? Also I have AP credit for all of the gen eds, so I am now unsure what to add.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich courses should I add to this schedule to make it complete? Thanks.",

Look for things with an A&amp;H and/or S&amp;H credit, as there are a whole bunch of super duper interesting classes that you can take with all that. I reccomend taking ones outside of your major/ main field of study, just to broaden your experience and maybe learn something new",

For example - Ancient Greek Culture is a 3 credit hour class, but those 3 credits apply to both arts and humanities as well as world cultures. So you will only gain 3 credits, but they will apply to multiple gen Ed requirements. History of western medicine was another one of those. Try to find classes where the credits you earn check multiple boxes",

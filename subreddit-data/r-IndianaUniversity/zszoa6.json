I\u2019ve heard a lot about how bad the hazing can be and I\u2019m honestly very worried for them haha. Are there any sororities that are more chill or at least won\u2019t make it dangerous to join?\nI mean I\u2019ve heard that some sororities will make the freshmen do coke or give random guys bjs or tell them how much weight they need to lose and stuff\u2026 That\u2019s so fucked up.\nI just don\u2019t want my friends to get in trouble or be injured or whatever but I also want them to be able to meet people and make connections through rushing or being in a sorority so I\u2019m mostly just wondering if any of this stuff is true or if I\u2019m worried about nothing.",

There aren\u2019t really easy classes, just ones that feel interesting and ones that feel like work. This kind of question, while common, can indicate that you aren\u2019t interested in learning so much as getting a good grade. That\u2019s a tough way to live in college because eventually there will be a class you aren\u2019t good in. Part of the importance of a liberal arts education is the wide range of subjects. I suggest you move away from the grades-focused perspective into the more learning focused. Even if you are at school to get the job after and that is your only goal, there is nothing stopping you from enjoying the process.",

    "postText": "Deciding (for undergrad) between economics at Krannert Purdue or economics consulting &amp; finance at Kelley IU. I am an international student and Purdue\u2019s degree is STEM-OPT so I have an extra 2 years. Kelley\u2019s is not STEM-OPT but it is much better known and so it might get me better internships &amp; job opportunities. I\u2019m also planning to pursue a masters (that is likely STEM-OPT) either right after undergrad or after a year of working. Should I choose Krannert or Kelley?",

Kelley is amongst the best business schools in the country, Krannert is\u2026 well not. \n\nAs far as just general life you\u2019re gonna enjoy being at IU a lot more. The alumni network at IU and specifically Kelley is crazy good and you can make some incredible connections.\n\nTo me it sounds like your options are to go to Kelley which is a better school and you\u2019d be done sooner, or you could go to Krannert which is a worse school, has worse networking opportunities, and it\u2019ll take you longer. Kelley seems like the clear choice to me.",

Purdue's School of Engineering is one of the best in the world. It has degree programs in computer engineering, aerospace engineering, chemical engineering, nuclear engineering, biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, etc. Luddy doesn't even come close. Luddy's program is specific to machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nHowever, IU does have top tier business, music, and public affairs programs. Purdue does not touch IU in these programs.",

    "postText": "Am I able to park at large ass lots over by the mall, Target, Fresh Thyme, etc? I dont see any signs that say that people will be towed (unlike the lots accross the street at McAllister's), but I've read about ordinances and shit that would prevent such a thing\n\nIf not, where could I park off campus? Preferably somewhere close to a bus line so I can just take that back to campus",

            "comment": "Personally I'd take advantage of apartments who don't have parking passes over risking parking in a public space. Fountain park, Scholar's Quad, and Cedargate Apartments are all near bus stops/campus in general, and you don't need a resident pass. I've definitely parked at Cedargate for extended periods of time when I was visiting friends and never had any issues.",

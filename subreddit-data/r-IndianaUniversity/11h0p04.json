    "postText": "Hey guys. I'm an international student applying for IU Kelley for the MSIS program. Recently had the interview and was grilled by the interviewer over my low grades and work ex. Kelley is my dream college to join and I'm thinking that I messed it up now. I just wanted to know if people usually get rejected in the second interview. I'm also open to hear your interview experiences if you are willing to share.",

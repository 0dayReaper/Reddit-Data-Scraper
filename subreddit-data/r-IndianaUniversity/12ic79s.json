It is what you make it, the difference is the former just did the coursework and the latter did their own learning, programming, etc. in addition to the fundamentals taught by the school. You won\u2019t be limited in any way but nothing will be handed to you.",

But CS is great, you could work remote while possibly making a salary intended for areas with a high COL. I have one more year left of CS and I will be done. The first year imo is the hardest since they are weed out classes and are pretty hard. I\u2019ve heard it has gotten easier though. Id also think about your specialization because you have to pick one for Luddy. Im software engineering.",

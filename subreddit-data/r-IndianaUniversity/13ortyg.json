    "postText": "Does anyone know the difference between these courses?  201/202 are the courses you get credit for from AP Micro/Macro and 251/252 are the courses that meet distribution requirements.  I looked and the school isn't offering 201/202 as classes in Fall 2023 - do they exist as actual classes or are these AP classes just awarded elective credit?",

            "comment": "There's a long story with E201/202 vs E251/E252/B251/B252.\n\n**I don't know this story**, but I do suspect it boils down to IU students avoiding taking these courses at IU by taking them at local community colleges and transferring them in.  Ivy Tech was a big culprit in this.  While the material was essentially the same, the standards were not.  Getting an A at Ivy Tech was much easier than IU.  To make matters worse, these courses were being offered online at Ivy Tech.  Not only could you just Google all answers for homework, but the exams were also online, so students would Google those answers as well.  Ivy Tech was making tons of money off economics enrollment so they had no incentive to change things.  Keep in mind, this all started pre-pandemic, so COVID has nothing to do with it.\n\nSo why couldn't IU just not accept the credits? My understanding is that there is an Indiana law that requires IU to accept credits from other institutions if the course is the same. This is of course well-intentioned!  The policy was obviously intended to help students transferring from community college or those with less money. Unfortunately, as your economics class should teach you, people respond to incentives, and students saw a chance to get a course for 1) cheaper and 2) easier. The vast majority of students take these courses because they have to, not because they want to.  Unfortunately, having a weak background in economics sets you up poorly for some other classes, like G202.\n\nMy belief is that IU created these courses to circumvent this ability to transfer.  From what I have seen of these new courses, they are quite similar to E201 and E202, but perhaps just different enough that they don't have to accept the others for credit.  My question though is what stops Ivy Tech from creating their own version of E251/252 and B251/252?\n\nRight now, students are doing the same thing with finite math (M118).  I suspect the math department will be doing the same thing soon.",

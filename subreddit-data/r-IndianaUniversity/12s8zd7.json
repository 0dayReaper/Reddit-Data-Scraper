    "postText": "So, I'm seeing that for 23-24 year housing cost price, Mason Hall is under standard with AC (also Wright Quad cost section disappeared too). Does that mean Mason Hall will have AC as well now? I remember seeing Mason Hall under standard without AC.\n\n[https://housing.indiana.edu/housing/costs/23-24costs/index.html](https://housing.indiana.edu/housing/costs/23-24costs/index.html)\n\nAlso, would you recommend living in furnished apartment?  I am trying to save money as possible.",

That\u2019s also where they will have the two Free From IX locations for those with food allergies. I read they hope to ramp up services at Bookmarket eatery in the library as well as at Wells Goidbody to meet the demand. \n\nThere will be options in the IMU Biddle building but that\u2019s not a traditional dining hall. Sounds like McNutt and Woodlands will be the popular AYCTE options.",

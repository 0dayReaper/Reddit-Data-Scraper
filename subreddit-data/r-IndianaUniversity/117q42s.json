Also you seem knowledgeable about this so do you know if I have to apply to the partnership awards to the individual school or are they granted automatically?",

This won\u2019t include your EFC or \u201cpersonal expenses/transportation\u201d in cost of attendance calculations. \n\nSo, let\u2019s say cost of attendance (without personal or transportation) is 20k. Your EFC is $1000. You got an 8k deans scholarship. So there\u2019s 11k covered by the covenant (or maybe H&amp;H)\n\nGetting more scholarships won\u2019t let you go over that 20k, it\u2019ll just reduce the covenant/H&amp;H money",

Or is it because 6k + 5.5k FAFSA = 11.5k total (which is conveniently the cost of in state attendance). I was hoping as an out of state student FAFSA wouldn't be counted towards that as it is a literal loan, it must be paid back...",

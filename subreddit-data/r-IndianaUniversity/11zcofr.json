    "postText": "Hi! I'm an incoming freshman majoring in Business at the pre-university division and will try for standard admission to Kelley. I have read many comments about dorms/neighbourhoods in IUB and narrowed my preferred dorms to Briscoe, Mcnutt, and Forest. But most of those comments are like from a couple years ago, so I was wondering if I could get your guys thoughts on Briscoe, Mcnutt and Forest. I'm also open to  other dorms or neighbourhood suggestions. I don't mind the partying aspect but also need some time where I can study, and I would prefer if I didn't share a bathroom with a bunch of ppl. Thanks.",

            "comment": "Briscoe is a great option. To get this, your best bet will be to request the Northwest neighborhood AND enhanced housing. Only downside is no eatery onsite, but McNutt is very close by. There\u2019s no guarantee you won\u2019t be put in McNutt or Foster though.\n\nMcNutt is fine, super close to Kelley, recently renovated, and has a solid eatery onsite. It is also probably the rowdiest party dorm, so it might not always be the greatest place to study (plenty of other places nearby, though). \n\nForest is great too, has one of the best eateries on campus. But it\u2019s about as far from Kelley as you can get living in the dorms. There are always buses you could catch, but living on the south side of campus might make your daily commute harder.",

            "comment": "Another great neighborhood would be the central neighborhood. I live in Teter and it is a really great spot on campus with 10-15 minute walks to almost any spot on campus. It\u2019s down the road from Kelley but also allows you to be closer to other buildings that you might have classes in than you would be in Briscoe or McNutt",

Life guard is one of the hardest jobs to get with strenuous physical tests and group interviews. But I think it paid more than $22/hr and that was in 2014-2015. Bus Driver is less competitive as far as I know, but also very high paying. I know it\u2019s a stressful job though, Bloomington has tons of pedestrians and tight corners that could make driving suck for a bus driver. Those are the two highest paying jobs I knew of on campus. \n\nThe highest off campus jobs you can get likely are bartenders, I delivered pizza and Mother Bears was an awesome place to work. I routinely was making more than $20/hr.",

The training is one-on-one and also prepares you for the CDL ( commercial drivers license) test. My co-workers are friendly and supportive of new drivers. The students are also very positive and easy to work with. Drive a bus!",

I\u2019m not sure what type of visa or paperwork is needed for that unfortunately. You can reach out to the IU International Services who hopefully could help you out: https://ois.iu.edu.",

UITS is maybe the best job you can get, in terms of how easy it can be and the money. But again it\u2019s be like $11/hr or so. Night janitor at the Student Union pays a little more and is chill, but the hours would be like 9pm-3am",

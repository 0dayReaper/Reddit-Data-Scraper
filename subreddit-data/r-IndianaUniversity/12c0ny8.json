    "postText": "I'm A CS major in Luddy, and I'm looking for some classes I should take next year. I've taken 211, and will soon finish 212 and (hopefully) 241. Right now for Fall I'm taking Data Structures and Tools for Computing.\n\nWhat are courses should I consider taking? And would it be reasonable to push Data Structures back to Spring 2023 - when I'd normally take it - so I could have more free time to prepare on my own? I've heard the class is pretty hard.",

I transferred to IU as a sophomore so my junior year, I was taking 3 CS classes a semester (this year). I now only need 3 more CS courses and im done. I\u2019m software engineering specialization too. But I\u2019d recommend 343 and 291. 291 opens up computer structures, then that opens up to intro to OS and computer networking.",

    "postText": "Is there anywhere online I'm not finding that has the syllabi for our courses coming up?\n\nI'd really appreciate being able to figure out ahead of time what I can take based on the workload of a course. I'm finishing my first year at IUB and after a packed first semester, scaled back with one less class but then all the classes I took in the spring were unexpectedly bare in terms of outside classwork. I could have easily taken another class (or two) if I knew beforehand. \n\nI've browsed google, the IU website and this reddit and have come up empty. I was able to find a syllabus for a previous semester of a course I'm taking in the fall from some random document website, and while it may change, it's still helpful. Yet let's say I've got HIST-A 363 (Indiana History), while I'm sure it'll be an interesting history course I enjoy, I'd still like to know how much writing is involved before I pile up other writing based courses.",

Some prof. make their syllabus like three weeks before class starts. \n\nYou are not breaking any rules by asking and in fact you should develop this practice of asking for what you need and making informed decisions. Worst case scenario is that they ghost you!\ud83e\udd23",

Downtown Bloomington and the areas next to the gates on the west side of campus are basically the Green Street of Bloomington. That\u2019s where all of the good restaurants and nightlife is gonna be. Bloomington is not nearly built as vertically as UIUC tho there are no gigantic apartment complexes in town like in Champaign",

The main drag leading from the Gates toward the court house has some very good restaurants and shops. A lot of good food options rigjt around campus but all small budlings",

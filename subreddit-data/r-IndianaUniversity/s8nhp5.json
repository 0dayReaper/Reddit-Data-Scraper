    "postText": "It's only been the second week of the semester and I'm already struggling with school. A lot of my friends are sick &amp; are pending/have positive COVID results, which prompts me to stay home and quarantine for a bit. The issue is, I feel a bit punished in a way for staying home. I have a few classes that do not have Zoom option available. Although they post slides, they're vague and GREATLY benefit from being in person instead, as they are designed that way. Is anyone else running into this issue as well?",

As a professor, I\u2019m struggling, too. And scared. Please get in touch with your professors, try not to be too hard on yourself, and give yourself a little more time to find a routine that works for you.",

Ive managed to avoid it all thus far, but I don\u2019t know when my luck will run out. I feel like people don\u2019t realize that when hospitals fill up, people with non-Covid related ailments can\u2019t get beds either. Heart attacks, strokes, car accidents, etc. these require emergency care, and now people cannot get it. Because the hospitals are flooded with Covid patients. There\u2019s really nothing any of us can do, and the university has left us all in the dark.",

Both are facts. 1) Omicron is highly contagious and many if not most people will get it. 2) college-aged people are indeed not at risk of omicron (or the other variants, according to the cdc: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html). If you are going to the hospital 60% of the time you get a cold, which obviously is not normal for COVID or just about any other sickness, then you should be getting some kind of accommodation from the university (and should definitely not take in person classes).\n\nAnd if you are vaccinated, university policy does not require you to quarantine after close contact unless you show symptoms.",

College aged people may not be at higher risks of getting severely sick or die from COVID than other aged-populations, but that does not mean we are immune or not at risk. Everyone, vaxxed or not, is prone to COVID, though our rates of getting it vary depending on many factors. \n\nAlso, I do not get sick often, but it just happens that when I do, signs are more severe than the average person. I will look into more accommodations for myself to combat this, but even with your recommendation of not taking in person classes, it is difficult. How can we do this, when there aren't many options to do so? Zoom isn't available for some classes and I know MANY professors that refuse to record lectures. Aside from that, a lot of class formats were just made to provide better education in person. Things like labs and demos are just easier when you can see it in front of you. Sick people that stay home are missing out on a lot of their education because classes are structured this way with no alternatives. It's like sick people are being punished for being sick. \n\nAlso, university policy may not require close contact quarantine unless symptoms are present, but it's also best to keep in mind a large population of us will be asymptomatic carriers due to our age and our high vaxxed status.",

When I, and I suspect most people, use \"at risk\", we mean at risk of some kind of serious harm. The normal experience of covid for most people, and especially with the omicron variant, involves no serious harms whatsoever.\n\nRegarding your propensity to go to the hospital: what did you do before the pandemic? I imagine you were in the hospital often. Surely zoom high school classes, for example, were not an option pre-pandemic? Unfortunately, there are limits as to how much an institution can accommodate someone who is chronically sick. You might need to take an online program. But surely you have been dealing with this for sometime and have a much better plan than whatever I can spitball.\n\nIt is true that lots of people will be asymptomatic carriers, especially those who are vaccinated. But you cannot conflate that with asymptomatic transmission, which is very, very rare. And this has been known for over a year (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w).",

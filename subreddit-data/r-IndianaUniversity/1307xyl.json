I've taken 2 AP classes in my freshman and sophomore year in total and will take 3 in my junior. have a 3.56 GPA. I am aiming for a 34 on ACT.  I also do taekwondo (8 years) and play badminton(4 years). I was getting nervous as I'm not sure if my GPA is good enough. I have decent extras as well. I just want to know early to what I can do",

            "comment": "It's very good that you are planning early. It will definitely help you in the future.\n\nIn my opinion, you should mainly focus on extracurricular and gpa. From my understanding, US college admission team overall now look at extracurricular a lot compared to the past.\n\nOfc if you take ap classes and get a good grade, it's better, but i find that ap classes are not usually helpful unless it fulfills gen-ed course like ap lang, ap us history. So, research ahead if your intended major actually needs you to take those ap classes. Because you dont wanna spend money on ap test and spend time studying that material for a whole year for nothing. You can focus on something else instead of taking wrong ap class. \n\nIf you think your gpa is gonna be iffy, write good essay when you apply to iu. Maybe you can start think about what you are gonna say in essay now. For example, tell them what kind of person you are, why you would be good fit to join kelley business school, what drives you to pursue this major/career, what is your career goal, how would joining IU help you achieve your goal ,etc\n\nFor extracurricular, i guess try to join major related club as possible and try to become officer, go on competition, etc since you have been already doing taekwondo and badminton for long time which are very good. \n\nI would also recommend reaching out to your intended major's professor on what you can do. Professors will be happy to help you if you ask.\n\nI'm not a business major so i dont know how process goes for business school but i have experienced college life long enough and those are best advices i can give you right now because i have seen so many different examples of high schoolers as an orientation leader before. Process might be overwhelming, but you will do fine. Good luck",

I am thinking of starting an FBLA(Future business leaders of America) chapter in my hs next year. As far as my GPA goes I would like to aim for a 3.9 or above and hopefully, I can by the end of junior. I am taking three APs(Stat, Psych, APES) next year so hopefully",

They just run a filter for GPA/Test Scores/Identity Groups and accept the people that meet the criteria. \n\nI don\u2019t think they would look for a second at your ECs unless you\u2019re on the appeal bubble.\n\nOnly take classes that\u2019ll transfer. Any AP Econ will not, don\u2019t waste your time.",

I do have other options some being UTK Haslam cause it is instated whihc would be a lot cheaper for my parents and some being others such as University of Georgia, Boston College, Purdue, and OSU.",

I had to write a petition and was accepted as a DA to Kelley. \n\nMy suggestion is to worry about what you can control right now. That being finishing out the school year strong, researching several school options, and preparing for next year. It\u2019s good to be thinking about this stuff but it seems you\u2019ve already got a pretty strong resume.",

You should never just start randomly writing.\n\nThere are exceptions to word vomiting on a page, those being certain creative writing, journaling, and posting on social media (lol).\n\nMake sure you have a plan for every college essay you\u2019re going to write. The common app essay is a perfect example where outlining will save you from not only repeating yourself, but contradicting yourself as well. Best of luck!",

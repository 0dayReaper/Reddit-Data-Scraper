    "postText": "Hello. I have question about which school I should enroll to. I got off the waitlist from university of pittsburgh, indiana university bloomington. I was originally going to go to iowa state university as statistics major because of it's reputation. However, since I got two more options I am wondering where I should really go. I intend to become a data scientist and I want to ask you about these universities. What are your thoughts?",

            "comment": "Unless you're targeting Ph.D. programs, it's not likely to make huge differences for undergraduate statistics majors among those three options.  If you can take a second major (or maybe even a minor) in business at IU, you can get access to Kelley's career services, which might be a worthwhile difference in getting a job, but the value of that needs to be offset by the cost difference from the other schools.  There tends to be a decent demand for stats majors these days.",

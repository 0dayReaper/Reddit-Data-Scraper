    "postText": "Hello everyone/Bonjour \u00e0 toutes et \u00e0 tous : \n\nI\u2019m interested in potentially attending IU for graduate school and have thoroughly researched their French program. I had some questions about the school in general, so if no one in this Subreddit has studied French, it\u2019s all good!!\n\n1). What\u2019s the community atmosphere of IU like? I\u2019m not really talking about the town, but more of camaraderie between the students and faculty. Currently, I go to a larger school, and have not gotten to know people well or really made a solid friend group. Do people get to know each other well? Is it easy to build a network? Are professors of the campus encouraging?\n\n2). Is there lots of research going on at IU? If so, are students generally booking in on it? During my undergraduate career, it has been somewhat difficult to find opportunities for research in the humanities, particularly in languages. \n\n3). I know that the language programs at IU are excellent. Has anyone here taken graduate-level courses in French or the Romance Languages or second language studies? What was that like? I\u2019m interested in either French Linguistics or Literature (undecided), with a minor or double doctorate in Second Language Studies.",

            "comment": "1) I\u2019m not too knowledgeable about the French program, but I interact a lot with the Germanic department and the Spanish and Portuguese department and I\u2019ll say that the relationship between student and teachers is very welcoming. There are many events thrown for people that are interested in German and Portuguese but Spanish oddly enough has less activities run by the department. I know one of the French literature professors and she\u2019s really sweet but the department doesn\u2019t seem to do as many things in helping students get the opportunity to interact with professors as much as other department but there is a weekly event not run by faculty that meet at a restraint and talk in French and eat or drink coffee. This is a very good and easy way to meet new people and friends.\n\n2) I have no clue about research as it doesn\u2019t pertain to my major and I don\u2019t know much about graduate school.\n\n3) I haven\u2019t taken graduate level courses but I have taken 400 lvl German literature classes and I would say we go pretty in depth and they don\u2019t back down when it comes to advanced literature and topics even as an undergraduate. From talking with graduate students tho, they always seem to have a cooler selection and even dive into learning dead languages through knowledge of German which I could assume should help with understanding linguistics in how languages have changed over time in morphology and grammar. I also know that they have classes about linguistics of Spanish in Spanish and of German in German so maybe French has one too",

I\u2019ve heard about the crimson cupboard and I want to know how it works. I read online that it\u2019s at the campus view apartments. Do I go inside the main lobby to find it? And also, will I get ticketed for parking if I\u2019m there for about 15 minutes?",

It's in the main lobby--as soon as you go through the main doors you'll see their table set up with a sign, so super easy to find. As for parking, I'd say park somewhere away from the building between all the other resident cars, and it's unlikely you'll be ticketed. There is visitor parking, but it's metered. Again, I've never used the service, but the people seem super nice, and it seems like they'll just ask you to fill out a form and then get your food.",

            "comment": "Admission is competive as you know. Acceptance rate hovers in the high 30s. SATs over 1290 along with 3.7 gpa are approximate admission for the Direct Admit program. First apply to IU. See the website Kelley&gt;Admissions for more details. \n\nIn my experience, and I used to run the UG program, most students who want internships get them. But you must be diligent and stay on top of the process.\n\nGood luck.",

If u use acceptance rate 2 measure prestige, then Kelley is prolly mid range level at an estimated 38% acceptance rate. Overall, the school sets u up w/ networking opportunities from top level banks like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America. It\u2019s worth noting that u have 2 work hard academically to get these networking opportunities.",

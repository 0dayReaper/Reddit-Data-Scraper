            "comment": "I would say this year, there are roughly 80-90 graduating seniors or so in IB full time, with another 90-110 interns. So roughly 100 each year, as the IBW keeps growing About 60-70 of those come from the Investment Banking Workshop each year, leaving maybe 20 ish spots for non IBW people. 21 of the graduating seniors in the IBW were at BB, 23 at MM and about 15 at Elite Boutiques with the rest at smaller boutiques, MBB Consulting, or pursuing a position in another industry. It\u2019s probably split 45-35-20 NY-Chicago-Other in terms of location but it really depends on what position and at what firm. The bottom line is that if you\u2019re in the IBW, you will get a solid banking job no matter what, outside of that it is very difficult",

AKPsi is prob slightly better for IBW, while DSP places great in IB but also does best in consulting. PGN is becoming stronger and has solid placements everywhere. If you want to join a business frat though, the most important thing is finding one you vibe with the most, all of them have connections and resources to help you become successful",

If you aren\u2019t someone they want to be around, no amount of preparation or \u201cdoing the right things\u201d will get you that. \n\nAlso although I do agree that being involved is good, it\u2019s much more about correlation than causation. Being in ECMG or KC doesn\u2019t increase your chances of getting in to whatever workshop your trying to get into. It\u2019s the people, environment, and attitude you develop while applying and in these orgs that set you apart. \n\nThere\u2019s no formula and so many uncontrollable factors to getting a job in ib, er, or whatever job your looking for.  Figure out who you want to be and it\u2019ll make things a lot easier.\n\nJust my two cents",

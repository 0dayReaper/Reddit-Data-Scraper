    "postText": "I\u2019m a transfer student trying to get into kelley through standard admission. \n\nI had two W\u2019s this first semester, one was a history class at the beginning of the semester that I thought would be interesting and was totally the opposite, which I dropped before I even had a grade yet. \n\nThen secondly Calc, I was too worried to finish with a C.\n\nI ended up with a B+ in k-201 and A+ in A-100, and had a 3.6 for the semester. My gpa is a 3.46 right now and I\u2019m bringing in about 47 credit (will be more after this spring semester). I\u2019m also doing Calc next semester along with my the rest of the I-core pre-requisite. \n\nWhat do you think my chances are? On the website it says W\u2019s don\u2019t count against your application unless you have multiple W\u2019s in an I-core pre-requisite. \n\nAppreciate it.",

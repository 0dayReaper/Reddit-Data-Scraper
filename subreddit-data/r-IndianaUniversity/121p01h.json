    "postText": "Hi all,\nI was recently accepted into the Kelley MBA program. I\u2019m strongly considering attending. Can any current MBA or undergrad students tell me why they chose Kelley and any highlights of the program? For context, I\u2019m interested in consulting post-MBA, likely T2. Also interested in tech. Not opposed to staying in the Midwest but would like a degree that gives me the opportunity to relocate.",

    "postText": "https://old.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/wp0vsj/guest_parking_on_campus/ referring to this link, I should have been okay for parking after 5PM on weekdays. I parked in the EM-S spot at 8PM Tuesday. But I got a citation regardless. I'd like to see whether other people have gotten the same citations recently. Did something change with the parking rules? Thanks in advance.",

Not sure where you saw that. \n\nFrom the link in the top comment of that thread, \u201cPlease remember a valid IU parking permit is required after 5 p.m., except in a limited number of lots.\u201d",

            "comment": "I used to be on the committee that reviewed parking ticket appeals. The info in the thread you shared is wrong.  There is no free parking on campus anywhere, except during breaks (and summer break is only like 2 or 3 weeks, as there are 2 summers terms).\n\nIf you have a student permit, you can park with it at some of the EM-P and EM-S lots after 5pm, but you have to pay attention to the signs and make sure they don\u2019t say \u201c24-hour\u201d.  And you still have to pay for that ST pass. See this page:\n\n[https://parking.indiana.edu/permits/available-permits/student.html](https://parking.indiana.edu/permits/available-permits/student.html)\n\nI am in no way defending the confusing rules. They suck and the website doesn\u2019t make it easy to figure out lol\n\nBut, good news is, everyone gets one appeal waived every calendar year (not per semester as most think), so if you haven\u2019t appealed anything yet, submit an appeal for this one. You\u2019ll find the form on the website I linked above.",

There's free parking in:\n\nGarages after 6pm friday-all day saturday sunday (unless otherwise noted)\n\n&gt;These lots are free to anyone on weekday evenings after 5 p.m. and over the weekend.

It did link to the page above though",

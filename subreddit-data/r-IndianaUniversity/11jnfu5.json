I was wondering if there were any huge differences between Kelly in Bloomington and Kelley in Indianapolis. Any information is appreciated!",

            "comment": "The biggest difference between a Kelly in Bloomington versus Indianapolis is the amount of connections that you can make with the Alumni and people outside of the school. Since Bloomington is the caim campus there tends to be a bigger alumni base it's where the businesses go first to recruit, but indy is a much bigger market for opportunity in your immediate area. Pros and cons, but I'd reccomend main campus for sure",

If you want a large school and/or a party scene, then go to Bloomington. I wanna put out there that Indy really doesn\u2019t have a party scene and it feels like a small school. \n\nBut You should Consider that there\u2019s nobody who has experienced both so everyone will be biased. I like Indy, the idea that you aren\u2019t as connected in indy as bloomington i don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I\u2019ve met so many recruiters here. Us up here are still a part of the alumni network and get plenty of opportunity to seek jobs. (Especially Indianapolis based companies (duh)). Point is it\u2019s very easy to find recruiters and job opportunities here in Kelly Indy. \n\nOne difference I\u2019ve heard is that the ICORE project is slightly different here vs there. I heard that in Bloomington it\u2019s based off a hypothetical, made up company. In Indianapolis, we get a real company to make a rec compensation for and we actually present it to our professors and representatives from the company. I did ICORE last semester.",

It's a Kelley degree regardless, and highly esteemed in the business world. I'd argue the Bloomington route will get you more of a university experience with more chances to network, as IUPUI is technically a commuter school",

A biology degree from IUB and one from IUNW both say IU on it, which is all employers give a shit about it. You also don't have to put the location on your resume. The biggest difference is IUB is the main hub so you get more parties and more of a traditional uni experience",

Each campus has its own set of standards, faculty level, curriculums, etc. that makes obtaining a degree more or less difficult. \n\nYou\u2019re right, you don\u2019t have to put the campus on your resume, but if you don\u2019t you\u2019re doing so because the campus you went to is not held in as high regard as IUB. That would also come out through transcripts. \n\nOP is free to pick the school that they like most and meshes best with their goals, but the degrees will be different. Both good, but different.",

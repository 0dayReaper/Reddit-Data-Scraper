I would be working and studying at the same time. \n\nWhat are the things I should know? \nWhat should I prepare for ?\nGeneral advice and tips that would make my journey easy... \n\nAlso I don't mind connecting with someone who has done or is doing 100% online undergraduate course. \n\nSo I can know the things that would help me. Thank you.",

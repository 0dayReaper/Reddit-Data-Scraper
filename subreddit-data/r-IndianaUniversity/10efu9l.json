    "postText": "Hello ! I applied and was accepted into Indiana University and then accepted as a Luddy Direct Admit by consideration. I put in my intent to enroll and declared by Major as Computer Science, however after further research and taking Calculus 1 and 2 in highschool, I've decided I've become more interested in major in Mathematics and only Minoring in CS. How much work is it to change this? I'm still a senior in HS and I haven't started really much but I was directly admitted into Luddy and I don't know if switching to the other college is possible and becoming a direct admit there. At the end of the day i guess I wouldn't care if I'm not a direct admit for the other college, but I'd prefer to be eligible for the scholarships. \nI have a 3.7 gpa also.",

I'm not sure how all the scholarships work, but I know eligibility for most are only for the college on the application, and I can't find any information if you're still eligible for the original or new school scholarships upon switching. Plus you can't be re-direct admitted either \ud83d\ude2d",

You don't sound like you know for sure what you want, and that degree will provide way more opportunities than a degree from COAS.  Also, after a quick check at requirements, I don't think it would be hard to switch between math/cs after a year as you'll be taking similar courses.  You may even be able to major in both. \n\nIt also looks like there's some funny business with regards to wanting a BA or a BS in computer science, so again, chat with an advisor, preferably a [Luddy advisor](https://luddy.indiana.edu/academics/advising.html). Express your interest in math, and they may be help to set you on a sweet path that includes both.  Advisors won't be offended if you tell them you prefer math over CS, so be open and honest.",

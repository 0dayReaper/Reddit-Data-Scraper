            "comment": "Most people advise taking the two accounting classes (A306 and A304) in separate semesters. I\u2019m taking them both this semester and I have good grades in them, but it\u2019s a lot of work to get those grades. So I\u2019d recommend separating those two. Business writing and Kelley Compass 2 are both just busy work classes, I\u2019d separate them as well. K303 is honestly not bad as long as you go to class to learn the material. Doesn\u2019t matter when you take it. D270 is a pre req for D271 (both of which you have to take sophomore year). I would take D270 fall semester and D271 spring semester. They\u2019re both 8 week classes though so you can take them both in one semester also, but it was nice having half of each semester with one less class to focus on my other classes. G202, L201, and your Statistics class you should try and separate based on your other classes. For me statistics is the most difficult because the exams are extremely tough (the average for my class was like 65% this past exam), so I would knock out G202 and L201 in one semester and statistics in the other. Let me know if you have any questions about how to succeed in each class.",

So I was planning to do G202, L201, and Stats together in spring. Do you think my spring semester will be too difficult?\n\nWould you suggest taking 1 this summer instead?",

This was the plan:\n\nFall: F210, F255, D270, C204 (business writing), K303, A304 - 13.5 credits\n\nSpring: T275 (compass), L201, A306, S301 (stats), G202, Bus X271 (global bus analysis) - 15 credits\n\nAnd if I get into Kelley Honors this summer, I\u2019ll take the honors version of some of these. What do you think?",

I think all the classes are filled up at this point so i cant really change it. i should still be good tho right?",

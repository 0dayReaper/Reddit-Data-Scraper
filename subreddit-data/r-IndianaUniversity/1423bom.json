    "postText": "I have NSO coming up and I am wondering what I should do to be prepared in terms of what classes to take. As a pre-med student my gpa is a big concern. So getting teachers that genuinely care for their students and want them to succeed is very important to me. I am especially concerned for what teacher I should have for chemistry class: C117. Any tips on what teachers to pick or anything else important to know prior to orientation?",

However, all IU students have to take IU gen ed classes. \n\nHere\u2019s a link with the Gen Ed requirements: https://gened.indiana.edu/requirements/index.html\n\nI would knock out math, A&amp;H and N&amp;H, as well as World Culture/Language ASAP. \n\nLink to BA Psych major requirements (includes major classes and CASE requirements - CASE requirements are your prerequisites I believe): https://bulletin.college.indiana.edu/programs/index.html?bulletin_term=4225&amp;program=psyba&amp;_gl=1*10owtti*_ga*MTY4MDcxMTIzMi4xNjg2MDI4OTI1*_ga_61CH0D2DQW*MTY4NjA3NjAyMS4yLjEuMTY4NjA3NjIxOC4yMC4wLjA.\n\nThe CASE requirements and IU gen ed requirements overlap I believe.\n\nAlso talk to an academic advisor if you\u2019re unsure.",

It should be noted, coming from a pre-med alum, that in these huge lectures (hundreds of ppl), the professor can't exactly care about your grade. They can be a great teacher but it's all up to you to learn and practice the material. I'm sure you know this, i just don't want you to be surprised when no one reaches out to you to make sure you're on track! If you need help, AI's (graduate student instructors/assistants) are great resources!",

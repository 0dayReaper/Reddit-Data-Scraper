    "postText": "I have a question about the housing at IU. I\u2019m an incoming freshman and I identify as non-binary. I\u2019m majoring in music and would like to live close to the music buildings. Are the dorms based on sex? Will I have to share a room with someone who has the same sex and are the floors based on sex?",

            "comment": "If you are interested in The music community which is in Reed and just across the street from Jacobs, The floors are gendered though there are some Coad options in the core (the middle of the building, not the wings). Also if you email RPS They should be able to help you either get into a single room (which is an option but there's not too many so you may or may not be able to, but RPS tries to be pretty accommodating). If you do wind up needing to have a room with a roommate, I suspect That is based on your legal gender, However if you talk to RPS they may be able to work something out. \n\nTLDR definitely contact RPS and see what options they recommend, There are a few but some may work better than others depending on your preferences and wishes",

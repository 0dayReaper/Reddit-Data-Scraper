    "postText": "I came back home for break yesterday with all my finals except Spanish finished. Spanish was open from 12 am - noon on canvas today but I accidentally missed it which gave me a 0. Miraculously, my grade stills stays at a B+, but this is a class I 100% should've gotten an A in because of my grand fuck up, I'm not even gonna get to an A-. I've emailed my teacher to see what could be done to salvage the final, but I'm not sure if she'll even see it. \n\nI just feel so fucking terrible \ud83d\ude2d. I was expecting I could be at around a 3.9 this first sem, but now its looking like I might be just below a 3.8. I know a high 3.7 isn't a bad gpa at all but this was the semester where I got a really high GPA and gave myself some buffer for the future, and I'm in Kelley so I feel like I've destroyed any chances of getting into workshops or being a good candidate for internships/recruiting at all. I just feel so terrible. I feel like it's just gonna get harder from here.",

Like I keep seeing people saying that they\u2019re scared because their 3.5 GPA is bad, that since they don\u2019t have a 4 they don\u2019t get into a good school/earn job opportunities, etc.\n\nYou really gotta stop overthinking this man. What happened was bad for sure but a 3.7 is really good. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve lost many opportunities from this if any at all.",

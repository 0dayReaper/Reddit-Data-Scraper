    "postText": "For some background info I plan to major in Finance at Kelley, and I am currently looking for a laptop that is going to last me for the 4 years of college and beyond. As I\u2019m looking through models I was wondering how much of a necessity is to have a number pad on the laptop\u2019s keyboard, since I know that you can buy a USB one if necessary. Also I am currently looking at a Dell XPS 15 if that makes any difference.",

    "postText": "## Colleagues,\n\nAt today\u2019s Bloomington Faculty Council meeting, I discussed several important issues related to the current state of graduate education, specifically related to the interest on the part of some of our SAAs to be represented by a labor union. I am writing to share these comments with you and the entire faculty in support of open and continual dialogue.\n\nFrom my very first week at IU Bloomington, I\u2019ve engaged directly with graduate students to hear about their educational experiences. More than 15 meetings between school/college deans and their students have already taken place this semester. Vice President and Dean of the University Graduate School James Wimbush, Vice Provost for Graduate Education David Daleke, and I have attended many of these meetings. Every two weeks, Vice Provost Daleke also meets with representatives of the Graduate and Professional Student Government (GPSG) to ensure that our students\u2019 needs are being heard and acted upon.\n\nAs a result of our recent discussions, we have made significant improvements on several issues that our graduate students have told us are vitally important to them:\n\n* Enacting a higher salary minimum rate for our Student Academic Appointees,\n* Raising campus-wide stipends by 5%, and\n* Extending tuition waivers for classes taken outside the paying unit for all classes officially approved for the students\u2019 program of study.\n\nThis is the beginning of an ongoing commitment to identify and enact opportunities to improve the services to and support for our graduate students.\n\nAs many of you may be aware, some student academic appointees (SAAs) have stated that they wish to be represented by a labor union. This request has been reviewed and responded to by two former Provosts, [John Applegate](https://click.e.iu.edu/?qs=f0d0dd277b6859ca1d8287b98469a59091f441236fb01e7e22e3ce7d32f861926e0ee39c1966b414ad5228b6b1c237270e227ae1cccdde6d) and [Lauren Robel](https://click.e.iu.edu/?qs=f0d0dd277b6859cadfb3db8ac8f9a3b9b4dbf3e3c6e225d46ac2ec495d26cafc713e9382a8ce66e44d62e4fe91807ab11425c0f439aed918). The rationale for this decision is carefully articulated in their responses. Federal and Indiana law creates no obligation for Indiana University to recognize or bargain with a graduate student union.\n\nAs I have said repeatedly, I do not believe that we need a union to improve graduate education and I will not re-visit this decision. We will, however, continue to work with students to ensure that we offer high quality academic programs and support to each of our 10,000 graduate and professional students.\n\nDespite these efforts, I have heard from a number of you that you may have students who are considering participation in a \u201cStrike Pledge\u201d which calls to \u201ccancel all classes and sections that they teach...to not enter grades into Canvas...to refuse to proctor exams...to stop all non-research work for Indiana University.\u201d **This proposed work stoppage is a disappointing development that has the potential to cause harm to the academic progress of undergraduate students, including their ability to graduate on time. A strike by these SAAs \u00a0will place additional burdens on other graduate students, faculty, and staff who will have to complete any unfulfilled duties. Consider just one example: delays in submitting grades\u2014even by a few days\u2014may especially impact our 6,000+ low-income students who depend on Federal Pell Grants for enrollment. The students who are on the margins often bear the greatest burden of such a work stoppage.** This is unacceptable and does not reflect the academic community we all strive to create at IU.\n\nYou may have been asked to remain neutral or to not penalize individuals who stop performing their agreed upon duties. Although we may sympathize with the spirit of these actions, or, we may agree that there are remaining underlying substantive issues that need to be addressed, we cannot stay neutral in this moment. \u00a0The impact of a work stoppage will have substantive impacts on others to whom we also have obligations. As such, you and your departmental colleagues should develop contingency plans in anticipation of a work stoppage.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the [Student Academic Appointees Guide](https://click.e.iu.edu/?qs=f0d0dd277b6859ca45457daeab3940ecd4136298233f4682a0a6b19397462f458b161793cd83c0fc9a5bfbfde13314b1bbf72ece3a5701b4) outlines the consequences for SAAs who do not fulfill the terms of their SAA agreements. These consequences may include, as stated in the Guide:\u00a0\n\n* Suspension from work\n* Termination of appointment, including loss of stipend, tuition remission, health insurance, and other SAA-provided benefits\u00a0\n\n**The Guide further states that Reappointment of Student Academic Appointees is contingent upon, \u201c\u2026satisfactory discharge of duties in previous appointments.\u201d Participation in a work stoppage will be in violation of this expectation, and therefore, will result in non-reappointment to future Student Academic Appointments.**\n\nA work stoppage during the 2022 spring semester will have no bearing on an SAA\u2019s enrollment status as a student, and IU will ensure that SAA-provided housing and SAA-provided health insurance continue during any suspension from work.\n\nI understand that some of you may have questions regarding the impact of strike participation on our international students. In general, participation in a strike would have no impact on their visa status. That status is dictated not by university policy but by federal law, and is dependent primarily upon enrollment in a full-time course of study. For most students, that is unrelated to their Student Academic Appointments. In situations where an international student\u2019s academic appointment accounts for a portion of the academic credit they are earning, they should ensure that any possible suspension, termination, or non-reappointment would not cause them to fall below full-time enrollment.\n\nYou may have additional questions that this [FAQ](https://click.e.iu.edu/?qs=f0d0dd277b6859cac52c4ac88f29f9ad042fd60076da9efce2ef6ec475173ad9ce8f890f6c230c1150439c3b18734975442fd1d1906ec823) will help answer. I hope that our SAAs will consider the impact of this proposed work stoppage on their students and colleagues. \u00a0We all share a responsibility to ensure the teaching and research missions of the university continue, and we need to work together now and in the future to enhance the successes of all students, faculty, and staff. \u00a0\n\nSincerely, **Rahul Shrivastav**  \nProvost and Executive Vice President  \n\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\nEdited to add - if you are looking to support the organizing grad students, please visit their strike website [https://www.indianagradworkers.org/](https://www.indianagradworkers.org/)",

Summer funding or support is rare, at least in my experience.\n\nEdit to add: It is also relevant to know that it is RARE that grad students actually work 20 hours/week- most end up working much more, because of the intense work demands put on them (teaching 2-3 classes a semester, etc.). In my understanding, they aren't allowed to take other jobs per their contract (though that may vary by program?) and they pay hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in fees every year for things they cannot opt out of (the gym, other university resources they are less likely to use, etc.). All while taking a full course load and doing their own research.",

But as a full time student, these seem like fair enough wages IMO. 15k is enough to pay off in state tuition and at least half of your rent for the year.

It is not the main grievance, but among several- including what I covered with the fees, that the stipend does not follow inflation, establishing a formal grievance process, revisiting health benefits... etc. \n\nOne of the problems is the university makes it so hard to get in state. And, at PhD level programs there is less a chance that someone is in-state. They are so competitive, you go where you get in. So students have to pay thousands a semester for tuition alone, even if they have tuition coverage (because...some programs only cover \"95%\" even if you are \"fully covered\"). \n\nThis website provides more detail that you might find helpful, too!

I see why the university has these fees, but it\u2019s also stupid too. \n\nAs for the in-state tuition, it really sucks that more people can\u2019t get in-state, but that\u2019s unfortunately just how the American higher education system is setup funding wise with public universities. I can\u2019t really fault IU for that, however a pay increase to help offset that makes a lot of sense. I\u2019ll definitely take a look at the website to look more into this. Thanks again for the responses!",

Significantly worse than other states, per reports of individuals at this university working in the financial side. You're absolutely right that that is a systemic issue.  \nThanks for asking questions and looking into it!",

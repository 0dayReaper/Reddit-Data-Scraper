Any graves older than a century would contain nothing but dust at this point.  (There is a really tactless Lauren Spierer joke in here somewhere.)\n\nUnmarked graves on the grounds of a former state run sanitarium tho? That's really not at all surprising. It stands to reason it would occur a lot more frequently there.",

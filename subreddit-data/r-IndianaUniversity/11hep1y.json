How would Kelley be from a longer term perspective, where I might move out of Indiana to somewhere like SF/NYC? Also, I wanted to ask whether there are opportunities at the intersection of sustainability &amp; business at IU? Thanks! :)",

Minors are usually 15 credits and certificates are 30 credits, I\u2019m not sure which of the two Kelley co-majors are. Nonetheless, the Kelley co-majors are only available to Kelley\u2019s, and they are not able to be taken \u2018by themselves,\u2019 meaning you would only be able to take them in conjunction with a normal Kelley major like Finance, Accounting, Marketing, etc.",

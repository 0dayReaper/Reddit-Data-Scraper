I\u2019ll be attending IU fall of 2023 and am currently applying for housing. \n\nI\u2019m a human biology major, kinda introverted (but would like to branch out), female \n\nI\u2019m thinking of choosing to live in Central and kick a preference then see whichever dorm they put me in. \n\nWhich dorm would you recommend end for me? \nAlso, how would I go about searching for a roommate? \n\nThank you!",

I live in Wells quad right now, and while the building is wonderful a lot of people chill in their rooms (which works for me since i\u2019m an introvert, but maybe not if you\u2019re wanting a lot of interaction with people). I\u2019ve had a lot of friends who lived in Forest and loved their time there though",

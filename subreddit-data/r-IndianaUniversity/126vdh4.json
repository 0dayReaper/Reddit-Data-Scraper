The dollar stores around town are also great. I also recommend crimson cupboard, as well as mother Hubbard\u2019s cupboard (community food pantry, might have to fill out more paperwork to access). I recommend against village pantry or cvs, etc. because part of the prices (which are high imo) is a fee for \u201cconvenience\u201d, so I wouldn\u2019t unless I was desperate. One time I ran out of milk and I thought I would pick some up there and it was like 5 dollars for a quart. I was SHOCKED.",

            "comment": "Some of my go-to easy and cheap meals:\n\nYogurt and Granola - I get from Bloomingfoods so there are likely cheaper options from Kroger/whatnot - Brown Cow Yogurt 4.79 when not on sale for four servings, and bulk granola \\~2$ for enough to go with the yogurt.  About 1.75$ per meal, great for running out the door in the morning.\n\nCurry Chicken Salad and Asian Slaw Wrap - Again from Blooming foods, I get about 3.5 servings per container of chicken salad, so 3 meals and one snack. The Asian slaw usually gets me a bit more. It's by weight but About 5/6 dollars for the chicken and 2/3 for the slaw. I then just use a tortilla and some hot sauce, and can always add leftover veggies. Probably close or under 3.5$ a meal (2 wraps per meal) - This can be cheaper if you make your own curry chicken salad but this is zero effort and great when you can not cook.\n\nBroccoli and Tofu Stirfry - Not exactly crazy quick and needs more prep but easy (need a stovetop) I usually use a whole broccoli floret, any random other veggies (mushrooms, green beans, bell peppers, onions, garlic, radishes to garnish, cauliflower, etc) a brick of extra firm tofu, sesame oil, and then combine sauces to flavor. (I like a combo of soy sauce, a chili garlic sauce, siracha, and two types of red pepper flakes) You can also add nuts for extra protein and flavor.  (a peanut sauce also works well, keeps it from being repetitive) No exact cost but tofu is fairly cheap, under $2 for a container of \\~4 servings. Veggies will vary by what you can get and if anything is on sale (usually guides what I add) I also usually end up with leftovers for the next day. It's also great if you add noodles or rice for a little variety.\n\nBe sure to also check short-date items, there are great deals to be had!",

    "postText": "Have you ever heard about Granite Student Living and their DunnPark Studios(nearby sample gates)?\n\nI\u2019m considering studio at DunnPark, but there are some bad reviews about Granite. DunnPark looks pretty clean(in pics) and I like the location of this studio, but there is no review about DunnPark. I can just find the bad reviews about the owner company -Granite Student Living. \nI\u2019m starting master\u2019s degree this fall, and I\u2019ve never lived in Bloomington.. It is too hard to consider a rental studio just depending on pictures and reviews\u2026 \nSomebody can tell me about this company and DunnPark?",

I\u2019m not as sure about Dunn Park specifically. Like with any property group, some will likely be better than others. But from the management side of things, expect slow maintenance time and poor communication from the leasing office based on the reviews.",

They're doing away with security deposits too, in favor of non refundable \"reconditioning\" fees, just a bunch of bullshit. Rent anywhere else if you can",

            "comment": "&gt; On Saturday, Jan. 14, Farley, who identifies as a transgender queer student, [posted a video on TikTok.](https://www.tiktok.com/@declanhatcher/video/7188724278768979243?_r=1&amp;_t=8Z3QAwujtf9)\n&gt; \n&gt; The 57-second video starts with this:\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Over the past five months, I have experienced extreme harassment on the floor of my dorm.\"\n\n...\n\n&gt; In the TikTok, Farley said,\n&gt; \n&gt; \"It started with banging on my door and running away, then turned into yelling slurs outside of my door. Not only that, but they have dumped food and put trash outside of my door. Most recently, I saw someone licking the outside of my door while I was inside.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Farley said he considered it a joke \u2014 until he said it continued nearly every night for a month.\n\n...\n\n&gt; Farley said the harassment continued for more than five months. Farley said he took his concerns to campus and residence hall officials in October.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"I asked, 'What can we do? Can we have a floor meeting?' And they said, 'Absolutely,'\" Farley said. \"That floor meeting was supposed to happen end of October or early November. We had our floor meeting on Jan. 15 after the video came out.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; At that point, Farley said he also filed a bias incident report with the university.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"I was really hopeful for that,\" Farley said. \"They did make a bias report; however, I asked, 'What can I do? What can you guys do? I have all this happening to me. Is there anything that you guys can ... a floor meeting, something?' They told me my only option was to move rooms.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Farley said he received responses from university officials over the course of the fall semester, but no change was made. He said the harassment continued again.\n\n...\n\n&gt; As for the university, Vice Provost for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Dave O'Guinn shared the following statement:\n&gt; \n&gt; \"We are deeply committed to maintaining an inclusive and safe campus for all students. Protecting students\u2019 privacy is always a top priority, so we cannot speak to specific student matters. However, we strive to respond to any report of bias and harassment with a robust process to address reported incidents and behaviors. IU also has a dedicated Care Team that works quickly to connect with students who may be struggling or who need additional support. Support and resources come in many forms and can include assistance related to academic issues, student well-being, and harassment or discrimination.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; A campus spokesperson confirmed the Indiana University Police Department is now investigating Farley's harassment claims. That investigation started Jan. 14, according to campus officials.",

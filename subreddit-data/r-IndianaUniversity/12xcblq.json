Kelley is worth it for an international student only if you get into the workshops. Big 3 consulting give out 6-7 offers only for consulting workshop kids. The Investment banking workshop is even harder. Mid bracket banks will give out 90% of their offers only to workshop students. In the end kelley will get you a job regardless of stem, Obviously the salary would differ between workshop/non workshop students. Therefore for me personally it just didnt seem worth it so I transitioned to Luddy.",

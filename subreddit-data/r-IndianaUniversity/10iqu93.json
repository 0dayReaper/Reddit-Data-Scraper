    "postText": "I had a 3.11 wgpa and a 30 act and got deferred\ud83d\udc80 though this semester I ended it with a 4.0 gpa, which brought up my gpa to a 3.24. I had a full class load first semester and still have a full load second. Is there a chance I will get accepted in the RD round? I applied undecided though I briefly mentioned CS in my essay which might of been a mistake. Thanks",

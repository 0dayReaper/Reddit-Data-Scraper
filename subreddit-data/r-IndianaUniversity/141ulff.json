    "postText": "I am an incoming freshman DA to Kelley and have my NSO this week. I am trying to prepare and figure out which classes I will take during my first year. \n\nI know there is the 8 I-core prereqs that need to be done by the end of the first year and I have three of them done already (finite, calc, english). On the Pre-nso site it says not to add any business related icore prereqs outside of the ones you are pre-enrolled for your first semester, but I am wondering if I am able to add classes like basic accounting or fundamentals of econ for business to my first semester schedule since I already have other icore prereqs knocked out. I'm sure someone else has had a situation similar to this and I'm curious to see how they handled it.\n\nAlso, how many GenEd classes are a manageable amount for a semester? Is it smart to take multiple or is it better to spread them out over a few semesters?",

I would try to shoot for around 15 credits in total, so fill in the rest with your GenEds. Also, if you plan on studying abroad save your world culture credits for then.",

            "comment": "I came into IU with a ton of AP credits and previous courses that knocked out the English, Finite, and Calc requirements as well as many Gen-Ed requirements. As a Kelley students, you will be automatically assigned to Accounting and Business Presentations one semester and then K201 and Kelley Compass the other semester. That pretty much means you need to sign up for Econ B251 in whichever semester you prefer (I recommend first semester) and fill out the rest of your schedule fulfilling your IU Gen Ed requirements. If you take your 2 assigned courses + Econ, you can easily fit in 2 GenEds which should total about 15 credits. 15 credits is generally recommended but 18 is manageable too. This is what I did, as well as taking 2 courses towards a minor I wanted to earn as well as taking G-202 2nd semester which is an easy sophomore year Kelley prerequisite which will allow you to have more freedom sophomore year. Try to take advantage of whatever credits you have to get ahead on coursework now so that you have the freedom later to take courses that fit your desired career path or interests. Feel free to message if you have more questions.",

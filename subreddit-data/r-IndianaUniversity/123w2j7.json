Jacobs also has admissions and advisors you can ask them as well.\n\nI also want to say: there is a process for requesting additional scholarship. When I was coming thru IU, I filled out a form with my other scholarship offers and was able to get 5k more yearly out of it, which was over 20k in total.",

Not sure who is doing that job now.\n\nBut you have to advocate for yourself. This isn\u2019t going to happen for you.",

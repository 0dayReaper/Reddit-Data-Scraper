            "comment": "It\u2019s not in the same bracket. Those are like the best in the country, UMich, NYU, MIT, Harvard, UPenn. Like the best of the best even globally. IU is usually 8-14 on the list. Still incredible, but not that level. As such, it\u2019s hard to compare. The classes have the same content, and IU will probably be a more fun place to be at. However, financial firms generally love the \u201ctarget\u201d schools, and those your nephew applied to absolutely are. However, IU debatably is too. Plenty of kids land at the likes of Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, etc., and almost all of them get great starting jobs. \n\n\nMe personally, I think most kids at NYU are pretty shitty. They\u2019re entitled, and moderately inclined to not work hard. I don\u2019t know about UMich, but I would imagine it\u2019s better than NYU but still a little snobby. At the end of the day, he should pick where he thinks will help him the most, and can afford.",

I, along with some of my friends and acquaintances, have been applauded in internships for having the skills and experiences that make us stand out among our peers from other universities. Kelley has great workshops and is constantly adjusting their curriculum to what is happening in the market. I was guaranteed a fill time career as a sophomore bcuz our career center is one of the best, most connected in the country. Wouldn\u2019t trade it for anywhere else.",

Nonetheless, Kelley will look great on any application, but other business schools have great networks and more personalized attention. \n\nMore important to judge if he likes the school versus the ranking.",

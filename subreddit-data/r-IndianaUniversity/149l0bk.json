    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a grad student in a science field, but recently I have been trying to learn chinese (mandarin). Besides the usual apps, I also have an online instructor I meet once a week, but I would like to have more chances to practice. \n\nIs there hangouts for Chinese language learners and native speakers?\nI know that the portuguese language students have a weekly \"cafezinho\", so I was wondering if there was something similar for Chinese.\n\nI have thought about taking intro to Chinese in the fall, but it can't be through my program so I would have to pay tuition and it is quite expensive. \n\nThanks!",

They\u2019re run by Dr. Xiang Lyu, he\u2019s literally the best professor ever as he truly cares about your Chinese learning. He\u2019s def a character tho lol. his email is xlv@iu.edu and just ask him when and where chinese tables are held, theyre open to anyone and everyone is super friendly, you don\u2019t have to be taking chinese class to do it. good luck!",

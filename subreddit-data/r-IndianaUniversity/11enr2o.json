If you\u2019re struggling to meet the minimum requirements to get in, the coursework itself will be even more difficult. \n\nIf you\u2019re on the edge of the minimum, or struggle to take standardized tests - that\u2019s one thing. If you feel like you\u2019re pretty far off, then try getting in the traditional way (not direct admit - which I think is what you\u2019re going for).",

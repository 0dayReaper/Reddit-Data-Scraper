    "postText": "Hi guys. \n\nSuper late bloomer here, looking at getting into classes at Ivy Tech for accounting then transferring into Kelly. \n\nLooks like Ivy Tech accounting peeps have had some issues getting into Kelly as of recent. Is it even doable? Should I enroll in something other than accounting at Ivy Tech, then go for accounting at Kelly?\n\nMy HS grades were awful, and would say probs have zero chance getting into Kelly outright.",

Most students especially trying to get into Kelly are admitted under University division and then do their pre recs and so on And are then admitted into Kelly specifically",

Do anything but go to ivy tech. Kelley requires you to take all business classes at Kelley so taking it at ivy tech would be a waste of money and time cause the credits would transfer but would not count towards your degree",

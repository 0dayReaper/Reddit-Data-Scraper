    "postText": "A month ago, I submitted my financial documentation to begin the process of finalising my admission and obtaining an i-20 from OIS. As of today, I haven't heard anything about the status of whether or not an I-20 is issued. I'm starting to worry because the longer it takes, the longer it will take for me to secure a visa appointment in India, given that the current waiting period for booking an appointment is 2 months and growing by the week. I'm concerned that I won't be able to obtain a visa in time to begin my PhD programme in August.",

            "comment": "Unfortunately, there is nothing you can to do issue the i20. I uploaded my docs in March 6 and received the i20 last weekend. \nOn other side, the waiting period is derived from a simple calculation. They open the slots in bulk, and it goes to 10 days. Don't worry for visa appointments, you'll definitely get that.",

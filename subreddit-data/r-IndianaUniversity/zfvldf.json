You can estimate your govt aide being around 5k a semester\nCall Financial aide they will clear it up for you best of luck!",

I don\u2019t know your situation, I don\u2019t know how you will appear on applications in terms of financial hardship/academic excellence, but just know that IU will pay if you \u201cfit their qualifications.\u201d",

The last scholarship was because I called and asked if they had any more scholarships on April 20th. 1 hour later I had 20,000 in scholarships in my email. \n\nAlways ask, and don\u2019t be afraid to beg and call. It always helps.",

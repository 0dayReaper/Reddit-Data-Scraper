Every neighborhood is what you make it- I pref\u2019ed NW too and was assigned SE. Ended up loving it! Best food on campus!",

            "comment": "We got nothing we requested as we have learned seems to be the case for many. Lol! But the above poster is correct it really is what you make of it. My son doesn\u2019t necessarily love his roommate, they are VERY different, but they are respectful and both do their own thing and are fine when in the room together just not exactly friends per say but he has his friends hang out when his roommate is out and about unless it\u2019s like 1 person then they will hang out there in the room when he\u2019s there and his roommate does the same. They both go and hang out in their friends dorms at times too. And next year he\u2019s all setup with cool friends to live with in an apt on campus and truly excited about it. \n\nHe actually ended up closer to his major classes also and while he doesn\u2019t have a dining hall in his dorm like he wanted he\u2019s now glad because those dorms can be so chaotic with all the people in and out and he\u2019s right next to the dorm with the best food. He also is in Read which is the oldest dorm but also has more space and adaptability for a double than any other dorm as well as he has a half bath they share with 2 other guys in the room next door so that\u2019s an added perk especially for one of the lowest priced dorms. Don\u2019t fret it will Work out one way or another. \u2764\ufe0f",

    "postText": "So I've been looking at housing for the past week, and it seems like the central and south east neighborhood are objectively better than the northwest neighborhood. The dorms, like eigenmann, seem so much better than briscoe or mcnutt and seem better located for a freshman. Also stuff like the environment around the dorm seems better, with more things to do.\n\nYet the northwest neighborhood seems to be miles more popular, especially for Kelley freshman. I get the appeal of being close to that college, but wouldn't you only have one or two classes in Kelley as a a freshman?\n\n I'm very confused and would love to hear some thoughts/revelations!",

Also even then most Kelley students join Kelley student orgs which meet at Kelley/Hodge Hall. Its also convenient for things like group work and meetings. Back in the day some Kelley classes were even in Foster and McNutt. Super convenient lmao. \n\nAlso unless Eigenmann got a major facelift since I lived there, Eigy is really not that nice. Its average. Definitely better than Wright but still not Briscoe or Walnut Grove. I would argue that Northwest has the best dorms now because McNutt and Foster got lots of renovations and Walnut Grove and Briscoe are super nice. Eigenmann is good bang for the buck. Northwest and Eigenmann though are equally far.",

Mcnutt has a brand new multi million dollar dining hall, with a wealth of options right there. Closest Neighborhood to Kelley, and F bus essentially takes you to any spot on campus where you would have classes. Close to the SRSC, and also a good amount of Greek houses if you\u2019re going to be pledging.",

Mcnutt is pretty overrated imo but teter is the best dorm according to me.",

I imagine less than half of the class would actually go in person.\n\nThat way students who are afraid of getting or spreading covid don't have to go in-class and students who want to be in-person because they have a hard time learning online, don't have their education ruined.",

Assuming an employer doesn't want employees to get sick so they can come to work, they want them to wear masks, simple, easy, effective and controllable. The issue with enforcing the mask wearing of customers, that's not the job the employee was hired\\trained to do. To enforce it, an employer would need to hire and train new staff (or contract out). This is a large expense both financially and PR wise in the state of Indiana. IU has it's own police force, true, but they are not staffed to take on this work but admittedly they have the infrastructure to staff up faster than places like Killroys. However, the city and the state have shown they are not interested in enforcing. I have seen city and IU police openly and actively disregard the mask mandate since the start of the pandemic. So employers, even with the best of intentions, have been put in an unwinnable position from the beginning.\nIn my likely underinformed opinion, this is a failure of leadership at all levels of government.",

    "title": "I'll be an incoming freshman next year and I'm to decide about housing. I'm a DA to O'Neill so I could do the CLC in Briscoe. But the Collins LLC also sounds good. I know Briscoe is enhanced and what that offers. I'm not a huge party person, but I want to have fun. How is Collins since the reno?",

            "comment": "Collins is pretty good. I'm living there now and I have no complaints. The dining hall has had some pretty good food and the cafe has some good drinks for some nice prices. The top tower lounge is a really good study space. The facilities provided by the LLC are really neat (I wish I could comment more on this but I've only started being involved in the arts facilities this semester). I've never been in Briscoe so I can't compare the two, but I'm probably going to try to live in Collins for another year myself (unless I get assigned somewhere else since I'm currently applying to be an RA). \n\nOverall it's a nice looking building with a good community in a good location, with AC and average sized rooms. Hope someone from Briscoe can weigh in and help you make this choice.",

            "comment": "Briscoe itself is pretty nice overall. I got lucky and got a single room, which is really nice, but there are suites of doubles or triples that share a bathroom, so no communal bathrooms which is obviously a positive. The nearest dining hall is McNutt, which offers decent food, but the food at IU in general is decent but not great. Briscoe/ northwest part of campus is more social/party oriented, but for me it really isn\u2019t distracting, and you can chill out and not party or go out and still have a relaxing time. No matter where you live on campus you can find other party goers, and you can also find lots of people that just chill in their dorms. \n\nI\u2019m actually in the Civic Leaders Center, and I think it is a fantastic program. The main reason I joined the CLC was because of a $1000 scholarship and a cheap ($100) trip to Washington DC where you can make good connections to people in DC if you want to intern/work there someday. There is also an Athens, Greece trip at the end of the school year if you\u2019re interested in study abroad. The CLC seminar you have to do for both semesters of freshman year brings in speakers that are leaders in their respective fields, and often these seminars are interesting. Sometimes the seminars also feel like they drag on, but it\u2019s a brain dead easy A, so it\u2019s not really all that bad. You can also take O\u2019Neill gen eds in Briscoe with very good professors. I definitely recommend the Law and Public Affairs class with Professor Paul Helmke (former mayor of Fort Wayne and CLC director). Since you are an O\u2019Neill direct admit, I feel the CLC would align more with your interests/goals, but you do you. \n\nHowever, no matter which dorm/LLC you decide to go to, this is a big campus with all sorts of people you can meet. College and the LLCs are what you make of them. If you have any questions about Briscoe, CLC, IU, or college in general just DM me. Good luck and congrats!\n\nPS if you want to find out more about the CLC, go on instagram and look up iucivicleaders",

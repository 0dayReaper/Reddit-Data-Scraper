Davis, 56, told police that she stabbed the student because the student was \"Chinese,\" adding that it \"would be one less person to blow up our country,\" according to an affidavit shared with NPR. Not one less student to blow up B-town.",

This was an attack of hate, simple as. This individual would've been brutally attacked if they were a student or not. This comes from the hatred of Asian Americans by some white Americans, likely stemming from Asian blame for COVID-19. \n\nCynthia Wu, I implore you to never write an article ever again. An undergraduate freshman can write and think critically better than this, and you're core faculty. This is seriously pathetic.",

In just a few paragraphs she completely dismisses the fear and concern among Asian-Americans in this community and instead blames the housing market? I mean, the assailant flat out said she attacked the student because she was Asian, not because of some overblown town v. gown controversy. \n\nShame on the IDS.",

    "postText": "I am transferring to IU this upcoming spring semester as a second semester freshman and need to be a Kelley student by the start of the fall semester next year due to how workshop applications work. This means I have to apply during the application this summer so I can be accepted to Kelley before school starts back up again next fall. To do this I need to take all the Kelley pre requisites this upcoming semester. I am transferring calc, finite, and english in so the remaining courses I need are Bus C-104, Bus T-175, Bus K-201, Bus A-100, and Econ B-251. What are my chances of getting into all these classes this semester. I register for classes at orientation on January 4. Also, how effective is waitlisting classes because i'm sure a lot of people drop classes in the first week right and i'm probably going to have to waitlist some to secure enrollment in them?",

            "comment": "You should have all those already locked in on your schedule as those are all pre-reqs and the school should have already saved your seats in those classes. however I have heard that you may have to take some freshman classes sophomore year depending on availability(especially since this class is massive). Overall, you should be fine just do your due diligence when choosing what teachers you have for what classes and your set.",

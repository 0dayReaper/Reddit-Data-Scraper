Throughout this past week, faculty have been sending in ballots via email to weigh in on the ongoing grad student worker strike. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now, the ballots are in. While the results aren't expected to be released until Monday morning, faculty at IU say they're hopeful that regardless of the result, this will bring IU's administration to the bargaining table. \n\n...\n\n&gt; While IU faculty voted throughout the week, [an information sheet](https://institutionalmemory.iu.edu/aim/bitstream/handle/10333/14500/IU%20Notes%20for%20Faculty%20Voting%20v2.pdf) sent out to Bloomington faculty from IU warned that a union would erode the existing relationship between students, advisors and their schools.

Robinson has been working closely with the graduate students\u2019 coalition, which is affiliated with the United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America .\n&gt; \n&gt; Another factor was that many grad instructors wanted to be able to teach their scheduled summer classes.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cThey want to win their cause, but they\u2019re future faculty \u2014 they don\u2019t want to hurt students,\u201d Robinson said.\n\n- [IU grad student workers vote to suspend strike until September](https://www.wthr.com/article/news/local/iu-grad-student-workers-vote-to-suspend-strike-until-september-pay-union-benefits/531-7a076188-fcf3-4f4c-8466-63fd15c8c1e6)\n\n- ['You Just Can\u2019t Ignore Them\u2019](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/05/10/indiana-u-faculty-tells-administration-engage-tas) (Inside Higher Ed)\n\n&gt; Attendance at the in-person-only meeting was about 730\u2014many more than the 200 professors needed for a quorum but fewer than the 800 needed to vote on resolutions without sending them out to the faculty as a whole for ratification.\n&gt; \n&gt; One resolution (still subject to ratification) approved Monday, 683 to 39, with two abstentions, asserts that departmental and school policies\u2014not the provost\u2019s office\u2014govern the appointment of graduate assistants. The same resolution calls on the provost\u2019s office to immediately release summer graduate assistant appointments, as classes begin today. It also says that no student will lose reappointment come fall for participating in the strike, even if they turn in undergraduate spring grades late.\n&gt; \n&gt; Monday\u2019s meeting was adjourned before votes on two other proposals were tallied. But some faculty members present said that the sentiment in the room was overwhelmingly in favor of a resolution calling on the campus administration to engage in dialogue with the graduate assistants seeking union recognition while the university\u2019s Board of Trustees works on a permanent resolution to the labor dispute, namely a free and fair union election\n&gt; \n&gt; The room was generally against another resolution calling for increased cooperation among all parties in the dispute and reminding all involved of their responsibilities to submit grades and participate in shared governance, according to accounts from those present. (The union had asked faculty members to reject this measure.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Monday\u2019s meeting was called following a recent faculty town hall at which professors endorsed the idea of discussing a possible vote of no confidence in Provost Rahul Shrivastav, who has repeatedly said that IU will not recognize the graduate assistants\u2019 union. The Faculty Council\u2019s Executive Committee didn\u2019t allow a no-confidence-related resolution on Monday\u2019s agenda, or even a watered-down version of it threatening future \u201ccondemnation\u201d of the administration.\n&gt; \n&gt; Beyond specific resolutions, multiple faculty members said that Monday\u2019s meeting was about sending a message to Shrivastav and other administrators.\n&gt; \n&gt; William Winecoff, an associate professor of political science, described that message like this: \u201cYou have to engage constructively with this constituency.

In order to recommend a course receive the \"not sufficiently completed\" designation, the applicant must provide a reason.

But I want to thank all of the faculty and students that have told me they appreciate these updates, and I'll continue providing them as long as there are important things to share that aren't otherwise being communicated.\n\n&gt; The meeting on Thursday was very interesting. In attendance in person were Rick Van Kooten and Padraic Kenney from the College, Rahul Shrivastav and Eliza Pavalko from the Provost's office, and various Chairs and Directors. There were maybe 100-120 people present in the room, plus many more on Zoom.\n\n&gt; No Chatham House rules were invoked, so I do not feel constrained in sharing notes from this meeting. These are not minutes, they are a personal accounting, I share them because the Provost has apparently decided that communication with all faculty and students about matters of seriousness isn't worth the effort or trouble. So you get my effort and trouble instead! The \"headline\" info is nearest the top of this e-mail, but some of the most interesting things (in my view) are towards the end.\n\n&gt; The Provost maintains the hardest-possible line that is allowed by (his reading of) IU policies. Which, according to the communications Chairs and Directors have received this week, means that we need to continue to prepare for mass firings of graduate student workers across the Bloomington campus. These will likely be heavily concentrated in the College.\n\n&gt; The tone from the Provost was markedly different from every other time I've heard him speak. He was outgoing, cracking jokes, offered to buy each of us in the room a glass of wine at some place (\"Atrium\" in IMU?) that I'd never heard of. He ended up running off to the airport before he had to open his wallet, but at least he stayed for the full time of the scheduled meeting this time (which hasn't been true in all of his meetings, including one I previously attended). He also pre-announced roughly $75mn in new hirings and research support, which we should probably expect to go primarily to the new IU hospital and research center. Anyway: he was clearly trying to get on our good side, but he did so using a bunch of opaque MBA jargon that seemed to annoy everybody.\n\n&gt; The Provost deems the firing of 1038 SAA strikers - without possibility of reappointment-a \"worst-case scenario\", but according to him IU policies must be enforced at any cost. He was careful to remind us that these policies were approved by the BFC long ago, and he views it a shame that any faculty members would even question why we should fire 1038 graduate student workers on campus (nearly half of all SAAS). These are our policies, he was saying, his hands are tied! Why should we complain?\n\n&gt; The Provost did not suggest that these policies were open to any interpretation other than his own.\n\n&gt; I have read them, several times, pretty carefully. I have had some of my interpretations informally validated by the College. Our policies do not require the Provost to proceed as he has. I am quite sure about this.\n\n&gt; The Provost was directly asked how he wanted this situation to end. He offered no substantive answer. **When he was asked what he was doing to avoid the \"worst-case scenario\" he similarly offered no substantive answer.**\n\n&gt; He explicitly endorsed almost every claim made by IGWC, and admitted long-standing neglect by IU towards our graduate student workers, but said that none of that matters so long as they demand a union. He agreed they needed more pay and lower fees. He said they needed meaningful voice (although he also said that he thinks they already have it). He said that they are not fully supported, and that this situation has been festering at IU for about a decade. He said it is a priority of his administration to improve. He views having a union as contradictory to that effort, and he does not view the historical neglect of SAAS as providing license for leniency now.\n\n&gt; He announced that there will soon be a new Task Force to think about how to improve our graduate education. When questioned, he admitted that no graduate student representatives would be included on that Task Force, although they might be consulted by the working groups overseen by the core committee. That plan has been formally announced today (the link is here). There will now be one graduate student representative on that committee, but it is not clear how that person will be chosen.\n\n&gt; In case you missed it, the BFC passed a resolution last week asking the Provost to dialogue with the relevant graduate worker groups-something that the Provost's office has refused to do for over 3 years and refrain from mass firings. The Provost grossly mischaracterized that vote, claiming that the winning vote was determined by the graduate student representatives on the BFC. When another person in attendance pointed out that that was false (and actually impossible numerically), the Provost said \"well I was close\". He was not close (he shrunk the winning vote margin by about half). This is not the first time during this process that this Provost has made false claims along these lines. He did not apologize for his mistake.\n\n&gt; He is preparing a \"response to the BFC's resolution against his position soon. At this stage, he is now in opposition not only to the graduate student workers seeking unionization, but also the undergraduate student government (USG), graduate and professional student government (GPSG), and Bloomington Faculty Council. If anyone has seen communications from the staff or custodial unions on campus-yes, there are unions already on campus, and have been for a long time, and somehow the place is still standing - please let me know.\n\n&gt; The Provost said that if faculty labor is required to \"cover\" for striking SAAS, then overload payments will be made available (in theory, no specifics). Pretty much everything else he said was very vague, other than that faculty should expect more support for their work. Again: he was trying to get good on our good side. It did not seem to work. And he is willing to spend a lot of money in this situation, just so long as it does not go to striking SAAs.\n\n&gt; **One of the more interesting things he said is that he has been working on this issue since before coming to IU. In fact, he said that President Whitten told him before he was offered the job that \"ending the situation with graduate student workers would be his top priority once he arrived on campus.** Frankly I was stunned when he said this. **It validates some of the conclusions that many of us have made about the wider politics of the situation, and the fact that his \"listening tour\" was for optics.** Which makes sense, since he did not change his views on anything after going on that tour.\n\n&gt; After the Provost left Dean Van Kooten stayed. He indicated that only -25 student complaints had been received by his office so far, after the Provost had previously said that 200 total complaints \"from both sides\" had been received by the Provost's office-so he hopes that the situation will not escalate.",

                    "comment": "&gt; At that point someone interrupted to encourage the College to prepare for it to escalate, and the comment became the focus of the rest of the meeting. The gist of that discussion: RVK expected a small number (double-digits) of firings to occur, and he expects those firings to sufficiently convince the rest of the strikers that the admin is serious that they end the strike and drop the unionization demand. Someone told him that the striking SAAS would definitely not react that way, and that person told him that the College should be preparing to be in this situation again this time next year, with rolling (if not constant) strikes in between now and then. RVK said \"don't they care about their livelihoods?\" That person said \"Rick, they pretty clearly don't think they have much of a livelihood.\"\n\n&gt; Another person asked why we were having this conversation once the Provost had left. This was this person's first meeting on this subject, and was attending as an alternate for his department. He does not support unionization. Someone told him that the reason why we were having this discussion after the Provost had left is because there have been many previous meetings. They said that in all of those the Provost has made clear that he does not care what we think, he only wants us to enforce his interpretation of policies. They noted that the Provost was now in opposition to all shared governance bodies on campus of which they were aware.\n\n&gt; After a few \"ohhhs\" and \"ahhhs\" at the \"he doesn't care about us\" comment, the meeting ended. It ended collegially.\n\n&gt; My own view is simple: if the Provost fires only 25 people (say), then everyone on campus will know the names of those 25 people, and their faces will be on the signs carried on the picket lines during next year's strike. What RVK was hoping could be a conclusion that is only modestly \"bad\", and thus acceptable, would inflame the situation enormously. If the number of firings are small, it will also embolden the rest (and possibly lead to others joining IGWC and the strike campaign).\n\n&gt; On the current trajectory, there are two outcomes possible: everyone gets fired, or the Provost leaves office.\n\n&gt; I will say, however, that RVK made it much more clear in that meeting than ever before that he does not agree with the Provost's decision on this, and- implicitly, in my interpretation-was suggesting some avenues to pursue that could defang the Provost. I had already been exploring those avenues, and have continued to do so since. I currently have two plans that would apply in mass-firings scenarios. (I have other plans for other scenarios.) I will not write about these plans in e-mails, but I'd be happy to talk about any/all ideas along these lines via other mechanisms.\n\n&gt; As I left the meeting I asked another administrator if s/he believed that the Provost knew how screwed he was (I used another word). This person replied that she was not sure, but believed that the Provost had no such awareness. Maybe it's because he refuses to talk to a great many people, and ignores the recommendations of many campus groups and governance bodies that have been at IU a lot longer than his own 7 weeks.\n\n&gt; At this stage I do not expect our department to be nearly as (directly) affected as other units should mass firings occur, but if mass firings do occur that will, of course, have a major impact on the whole campus, including our department.\n\n&gt; I want to end with a comment: my position remains one of neutrality. That means what it suggests: that I will do everything I can to protect and support all of our graduate students against retaliation, whether they strike or not. If any graduate students are facing threats or intimidation, irrespective of the direction it is coming from, then I will take that very seriously. If any of you know that that is happening, then please know that I am ready to meet and talk with any of your, via whatever medium best for you.\n\n&gt; I have so far not heard of any actions from any of our faculty members (or graduate students) to pressure any of our students in any direction. I have heard about many great conversations about these issues between our Als and the faculty they are working with in the classroom, and in all of the situations that I know about faculty and students have come to understandings between themselves. I am very pleased about that, and I hope that continues and strengthens our collaborative norms in the department.\n\n&gt; I've been very encouraged by all of my interactions with faculty, staff, and students (including undergraduate students) in the department during this time. I mean that literally: every single discussion I've had has been constructive. We haven't all agreed on all particulars, which I never expected. But I've been very heartened by the seriousness and consideration that everyone has given to this issue.\n\n&gt; None of us asked for this. The Provost is overtly trying to turn students against students, students against faculty, and faculty against faculty. Instead, it seems that he is turning more and more people against his office every day. He has now been on campus for just over 7 weeks. It's pretty impressive, honestly.\n\n&gt; I will be in more meetings this week, most of which will be off the record. So the next few e-mails from me will hopefully be shorter and about more \"normal\" business like the incoming PhD cohort and end-of-year celebration of our graduate students. But I'm happy to communicate with any of you about any of these things.",

I know first hand, having served as a graduate worker in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs on the Indianapolis Campus.\n&gt; \n&gt; Graduate employees are seeking recognition according to the University Policy governing the \"Conditions for Cooperation Between Employee Organizations and the Administration of IU\" (HR-12-20) which covers other campus workers unionized by CWA Local 4818; American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME Local 832); and International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE Local 618 and 893). The policy further states that \"the rights of employees, independently, to associate themselves together, whether that association is known as a union or by some other name, is recognized in Indiana, and there is no legal bar to the collective representation of their employment interests to the public officials charged with the duty of fixing the terms of employment.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, we stand in solidarity with our fellow IU Bloomington workers in their intent to be represented by a union and collectively to present their interests to the administration. We believe labor rights are human rights that express the concern of all workers to have dignity and agency on the job. Moreover, we believe that unionization protects core academic values such as academic freedom, shared governance, fairness, and economic security.\n&gt; \n&gt; We congratulate the graduate workers in their efforts to unionize and call upon the administration to respond promptly and openly to their overwhelming expression of interest in representation. Frank, democratic, and collective representation of graduate employee interests will make Indiana University a fairer and stronger institution, poised to continue another two hundred years of academic leadership, discovery, and creativity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n\n&gt; Joanne Sanders\n\n&gt; International Vice President\n\n&gt; MPA '91",

            "comment": "&gt; Dear Student Academic Appointees,\n&gt; \n&gt; About 25 years ago, I arrived at IU Bloomington to pursue a PhD in speech and hearing sciences. I received an excellent education at IU, was motivated and inspired by accomplished faculty members and peers and had tremendous opportunities to grow as a researcher and educator. I also held a student academic appointment (as an Associate Instructor) and the tuition waiver, stipend, and benefits that I received were critical for me to complete my own program successfully. One of my goals as provost is to strive to provide the same quality of experience that I received to every graduate and professional student at IU Bloomington.\n&gt; \n&gt; Over the last two months, I have heard from some of you that in specific areas of the graduate student experience, we are falling short of that goal right now. You have my commitment, and the commitment of your faculty members, department chairs, deans, campus, and university leaders including President Whitten, to continue improving our graduate and professional education and SAA positions.\n&gt; \n&gt; To those of you who have sent me emails and letters, called my office, joined us at one of 15 listening sessions earlier this semester, and who have been rallying and demonstrating around campus the last two weeks\u2014 you have been heard. You have raised real, important, and wide-ranging issues that have built up over many years, and we have begun to address them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Recent Commitments\n&gt; \n&gt; Earlier this semester, after hearing your concerns about stipend levels and other substantive issues, I announced a 5% stipend increase for all SAAs, a new campus-wide minimum stipend rate of $18,000 for 0.50 FTE 10-month positions, and more flexibility in using your tuition waivers, all effective July 1, 2022. These three initiatives are our first steps to improving graduate education and SAA positions.\n&gt; Last week, I announced the creation of a taskforce to examine the future of graduate education at IU. Members of the core committee will be announced later this week, and I have asked that SAAs be directly engaged in subgroups related to SAA positions. Your insights will help us develop plans to improve all aspects of your work and educational experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; Later this week, I will have an opportunity to meet our newly elected Graduate and Professional Student Government president and vice president, and I look forward to working with them in the coming months. I also look forward to continuing to talk directly with you, our Student Academic Appointees. From May to August, I plan to meet with Research Assistants, Associate Instructors, and Graduate Assistants in units across campus to continue hearing about your experiences.\n&gt; \n&gt; Be Part of Our Shared Governance\n&gt; \n&gt; Graduate students, SAAs, faculty members, chairpersons, deans, vice provosts, university vice presidents, and all of us have been working together to make positive changes over many years. While this has improved things in many places, these improvements have not been consistent across various schools and departments at IU Bloomington. Now is the time to redouble our efforts to continue improving graduate and professional education.\n&gt; The SAA positions will require dedicated attention from many existing governance committees and organizations including, but not limited to, the newly announced Graduate Education Task Force, Graduate and Professional Student Government (GPSG), Bloomington Faculty Council, and the Graduate Faculty Council. Graduate students are part of these committees and your voices in these discussions are critical. \n&gt; \n&gt; Following input from GPSG, the Bloomington Faculty Council Executive Committee and I also endorse the reinstatement of the SAA Committee of the Bloomington Faculty Council. This committee is important to ensure that matters of concern to our SAAs are discussed within the BFC on a more regular basis, and that SAAs have the ability to engage directly in institutional priorities and shared governance.\n&gt; \n&gt; The student Committee on Fee Review has the responsibility to review and recommend mandatory fees for all undergraduate and graduate students. This committee \u2013 which typically has 7-9 students \u2013 will need to review each fee carefully and make recommendations about any changes that may be needed, along with the impact it will have on all students. This committee will meet again in the 2022-23 academic year to make recommendations on mandatory fees. \n&gt; \n&gt; As you may know, IU follows a decentralized budget model with many decisions made at the School/College or departmental level. This means, many school- and department-level policy committees, principal investigators and SAA supervisors, and many others will also need to be involved in addressing policies, practices, budgets, and changes for SAA positions. Many of these committees and organizations represent tables at which SAAs already have an important seat. And because we have a lot of work to do, we will need many of you to be actively engaged in these efforts. I hope you will join me and all of these colleagues who need your energy and ideas at each of these tables to bring about long-lasting change at IU.\n&gt; \n&gt; Last Week of Classes\n&gt; \n&gt; The end of the semester is always a difficult and demanding time, and I am especially grateful for those SAAs who are working tirelessly to ensure that your obligations, including holding classes and submitting grades on time, are met. To those of you who have chosen to stop work in the last few weeks, please consider your ethical and contractual obligations to your students and ensure that you complete your SAA responsibilities. You can do so confidently knowing that your voices have been heard, that your efforts have already resulted in substantive changes, and that you are helping all of us build new and better programs and initiatives at IU Bloomington. You have my personal commitment to continued support in the future.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; \n&gt; Rahul Shrivastav\n&gt; Provost &amp; Executive Vice President",

            "comment": "https://www.chronicle.com/article/after-a-fraught-semester-a-university-wrestles-with-the-meaning-of-shared-governance\n\nAfter a war of words over a graduate-student strike last semester, faculty members and senior leaders at Indiana University at Bloomington have found themselves in a messy rendition of an age-old debate over what shared governance means \u2014 which has effectively led to a stalemate.\n\nIndiana University\u2019s Board of Trustees sent a letter to the Bloomington Faculty Council in late May declining to recognize the Indiana Graduate Workers Coalition as a union, saying that it was \u201cincompatible with IU\u2019s approach to shared governance\u201d because the university has \u201cexisting channels\u201d for working with grad students. But some pro-union professors said that, in fact, the way Indiana officials have handled the situation violates shared governance because they have taken such a hostile stance against the grad students.\n\nGrad students began their strike in mid-April and suspended their strike for the summer on May 10, the last day to submit final grades for the spring semester, to \u201csee the effects of the strike,\u201d according to a strike-updates website, throughout the summer. They plan to resume the strike on September 26.\n\nIndiana isn\u2019t the only college that\u2019s recently clashed with a unionization effort, but the tenor of the conversation there has escalated in recent weeks.\n\n*The process to enhance the experience for our graduate students is best accomplished through the existing channels of shared governance and collaboration.*\n\nThe Bloomington Faculty Council passed a resolution in mid-April in support of the grad-student workers, calling for Provost Rahul Shrivastav to talk with the coalition to avoid a strike, and to not retaliate against those who choose to strike. That same day, university leaders told professors that they are responsible for disciplining graduate-student instructors who don\u2019t \u201cfulfill their assigned duties,\u201d and that those punishments could include being fired and losing their stipend, health insurance, and other benefits.\n\nGraduate-student organizers have accused Indiana administrators of \u201cbullying departments into undermining the strike.\u201d\n\nSam Smucker, a Ph.D. student and a member of the Indiana Graduate Workers Coalition, said it is disappointed in the board\u2019s refusal to recognize the union and called it a \u201cpretty big violation\u201d of shared governance. A university spokesman told The Chronicle previously that officials have held meetings with graduate students regularly. Smucker said officials haven\u2019t formally met with coalition members in any \u201cmeaningful\u201d way to discuss next steps.\n\nGiven what\u2019s happened over the past month, the rift doesn\u2019t seem any closer to being resolved.\n\n**Reaching a Stalemate**\n\nOn May 9, a majority of the 700 faculty members in attendance at a historic facultywide meeting voted to approve two resolutions \u2014 one calling on the university not to retaliate against grad students who participated in the strike, and another asking the university to recognize the coalition as a union. After the meeting, the faculty council held a formal vote on the measures. Of 1,900 faculty members who participated, two-thirds voted to support the grad students.\n\nThen, on May 31, the trustees rejected those calls. In that letter to faculty leaders, the board wrote that the university \u201cmust ensure that there is no disruption to the undergraduate experience\u201d at Indiana.\n\n\"Existing, long-standing university policies that were developed through shared governance recognize this, and any member of the community \u2014 whether staff or tenured faculty or associate instructor \u2014 who fails to uphold their responsibilities in this regard will be subject to the consequences stated in these policies,\u201d the letter states.\n\nThe board\u2019s letter said that the Task Force on the Future of Graduate Education, which university officials established during the strike in April, would make recommendations to improve the graduate-student experience.\n\n\u201cThe process to enhance the experience for our graduate students is best accomplished through the existing channels of shared governance and collaboration, some new and some that have long driven IU\u2019s progress,\u201d the letter said.\n\nA university spokesman referred The Chronicle to a recent email from the provost with an update on the task force\u2019s progress in meeting with graduate students. According to the email, the graduate workers\u2019 coalition declined an invitation to meet with James Wimbush, dean of the graduate school, but officials will continue to invite the group to meetings in the future.\n\n\u201cI hope to see even greater participation at the next round of meetings in July, so we continue to hear a broad range of perspectives as we work together to develop meaningful solutions,\u201d the provost wrote. \u201cThis includes representatives of the IGWC and other graduate student groups.\u201d\n\nSmucker said the coalition responded to Wimbush\u2019s invitation for a meeting this week with a request to delay the meeting a week to include additional department-level union representatives and accommodate their schedules. The coalition said it wanted to discuss \u201cpathways to union recognition\u201d and the graduate-education task force at the meeting.\n\nIn an emailed response, shared with The Chronicle by Smucker, Wimbush asked that coalition members meet on the day he initially proposed so that the task force could remain on track to develop its recommendations by the end of July, and said the coalition would have other opportunities later in the summer for \u201cfurther dialogue.\u201d\n\n\"So that the meeting is an actual dialogue, we ask that you find a time that is mutually acceptable,\u201d the coalition replied in an email, also shared by Smucker. \u201cRefusing to consider times that occur after the Board of Trustees meeting suggests to us that you are not seriously interested in union members\u2019 input on the Task Force.\u201d\n\nBen Robinson, president of Bloomington\u2019s American Association of University Professors chapter, said the way administrators have handled the union push was \u201can attack on shared governance,\u201d because of their \u201chostile\u201d response to the Faculty Council\u2019s recommendations.\n\n\u201cThe faculty felt it was damaging to our mission, which is to teach and research,\u201d he said.\n\nJoseph Varga, an associate professor of labor studies at Indiana University who has consulted with the graduate-student organizers, said the response of Indiana officials to the unionization efforts has been particularly combative, compared with other labor movements he has studied.\n\nThough striking is a \u201cpowerful weapon\u201d in labor movements, it creates a scenario that is not ideal for the grad students or the university. \u201cI think that Indiana University as an institution has ways of avoiding that, and one way is to simply sit down and talk with them,\u201d Varga said.\n\n*The response has really caused unnecessary rifts between the faculty and the administration.*\n\nVarga said the lack of productive conversation between the university and the graduate-student coalition so far has made more professors sympathetic to the grad students\u2019 cause. But it has also widened the divide between grad students and their allies and university leaders.\n\n\u201cThe response has really caused unnecessary rifts between the faculty and the administration,\u201d he said.\n\n**An \u2018Inevitable\u2019 Strike**\n\nBut Steve Sanders, a law professor at Indiana, said he doesn\u2019t see the situation as a mishandling of shared governance. Sanders said some professors are most likely misunderstanding what shared governance means at Indiana.\n\nIn certain areas like grading policies and standards for promotion and tenure, the faculty voice \u201cmust prevail,\u201d he said. But that\u2019s not necessarily the case when it comes to the discussion of labor.\n\n\u201cLabor issues, employment issues \u2014 yes, in a in a big-picture way, these affect the academic mission of the university. But they\u2019re areas where I think it\u2019s generally understood that the trustees and the administration have the final say,\u201d he said. \u201cFaculty have what\u2019s called in our constitution \u2018consultative authority\u2019 but not legislative authority.\u201d\n\nScott Libson, the librarian for history, Jewish studies, and religious studies at Indiana, said he doesn\u2019t think a grad-student union would be incompatible with shared governance, as the board wrote in its letter. But he also doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s a violation of shared governance to refuse to recognize the union.\n\n\u201cWe cannot remove the executive authority of the provost,\u201d he said. \u201cThe provost has his job, the responsibilities of which are articulated by the Board of Trustees and the president. It\u2019s not like we have the authority to just change his authority.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Libson said he doesn\u2019t think either group \u2014 the grad-student coalition or the Board of Trustees \u2014 will compromise before September 26, and a strike will be \u201cinevitable.\u201d He said regardless of what the task force on the future of graduate education comes up with, the coalition will choose to resume its strike in the fall.\n\n\"Given the political climate in Indiana, I just see it as unlikely that the board of trustees will recognize the union,\u201d he said. \u201cSo looking ahead, I see no resolution to this problem.\u201d",

Based on their progress, I anticipate receiving initial recommendations from the Task Force\u2014including those related to compensation\u2014by the end of the month. It is then my intent to swiftly lead the campus' response to these recommendations. In collaboration with various stakeholders required for successful implementation, we will focus on those recommendations that can be addressed as early as possible in the upcoming academic year. The working group on health and wellness has also now been constituted and will begin to meet in the coming weeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Second,** the newly created SAA Council within the College of Arts and Sciences, which is home to more than half of all IU Bloomington SAAs, held its first meeting this past week. I\u2019m grateful to Council Co-Chair and Professor of History Padraic Kenny and the council\u2019s members for their leadership in establishing this additional\u00a0platform for ensuring an ongoing voice for graduate students and SAAs, particularly within the College. I also view this new council as an important complement to the re-constituted SAA Affairs Committee of the Bloomington Faculty Council, which has a campus-wide purview.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, Wimbush and David Daleke, Associate Dean of the University Graduate School, will conduct an additional set of meetings next week with various graduate student organizations. The input drawn from previous meetings conducted in June has already informed the work of the Task Force.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Indiana Graduate Student Workers (IGWC) have again been invited to participate in next week\u2019s meetings, as have representatives from the Media School Graduate Student Association and the Graduate Informatics Student Association, among others.\n&gt; \n&gt; These direct conversations with student organization leaders provide an important complement to the work of the Task Force, and I am thankful to James, David, and to our students for dedicating time to meet and discuss solutions that can lead to sustained improvements in the graduate student experience at IU.\n&gt; \n&gt; And, of course, thank you to the growing cohort of faculty, staff, and students across campus who are robustly engaged in various ways on behalf of our graduate students. This includes more than 100 stakeholders who have submitted comments and feedback through the Task Force website. Your work is helping build consensus and identify meaningful action we can take in the weeks and months to come.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; \n&gt; Rahul Shrivastav\n\n&gt; Provost and Executive Vice President\n\n&gt; Indiana University Bloomington",

                    "comment": "This is a common line of thought, but there are a few issues with it (speaking as one of those striking graduate workers):\n\n1. The vast vast majority of striking graduate workers are doing far more work than the initial contract states. Ostensibly, being a student academic appointee (SAA)  is meant to be a \"part-time\" gig, but the reality is that (almost) no one is working part time - we teach whole classes, which requires course planning, in-class time, grading, office-hours, etc. Over 1,000 courses at IU are taught by graduate students, so our real hourly wage is much closer to $9/hr than the PR people would like you to believe. Also, many SAA contracts come with an explicit ban on doing other work (esp. if you're an International student), so it's not like we *could* be  hustling harder and working another part time gig even if we did have the time after SAA duties, research, classes, and more (which we don't).\n\n2. Even beyond our contractual obligations as SAAs, the research portion of our degrees is extensive, and that research is valuable to the University. They put out stories on us, they use our work for good PR, and we (indirectly) bring hundreds of thousands of dollars in for training fellowships from bodies like NIH, NSF, etc. That work deserves to be compensated. \n\n3. The \"free grad school\" or \"tuition remission\" line is suspect because, as far as I know, that money never **actually** exists. They University just sets an arbitrary threshold of \"tuition is $X0,000/year\", but since we all get tuition remission, that money is never paid. They could just say that PhD tuition at IU is free and *nothing would actually change financially*, but then they don't have that great line. \n\n4. The fact of the matter is, we need to be able to afford to live where we study. Even if all your points *were* totally accurate, it doesn't change the reality that $18k/year just isn't enough to live on in Bloomington in 2022 *especially* if you have children (as many older graduate students do). Even if you say \"well, you're getting a PhD so you'll be set once you graduate,\" I can't tell my landlord \"hey, I can't pay rent now, but, 8 years from now when I've got a job, I'll Venmo you a year's worth of rent.\" Also, most PhDs outside of a few narrow fields DON'T actually come with a guarantee of great wages *especially* for people who stay in academia. \n\nWe're not demanding $100k a year or anything crazy exorbitant, all we want is for the University to meet *it's own* internal standards for what constitutes a living wage in Btown. Amazingly, we all *like* the work we do - we *enjoy* teaching and interfacing with underads and we love it so much that we've all taken a massive pay cut for the privilege of doing it. All we ask is that the University make it possible for us to *keep* doing what we love (which also makes them rich, so this should be a no brainer).",

Not a soul on campus complains about faculty salaries, wonder why? Because it's not a problem. Sounds like you're about as braindead as our administrators and their administrative bloat. Education is unaffordable because the number of new administrative hires since the 80's has outpaced that of faculty hires by 5 to 1. Looks like someone didn't make much of their IU education.",

The best researchers at IU are not on a par with the best researchers in the world.  A few years ago a certain distinguished prof expressed the opinion that IU was not a place he would come to if he were starting out again.\n\nI don't know why IU feels that it must compete with the world's best research institutions at the price of 250-1 student-teacher ratios.\n\nBut this is a side issue, I agree that faculty salaries aren't a main issue w.r.t the grad strike - top admin salaries are much higher, and much less deserved.",

Will it extend into summer?**\n&gt; Earlier this week, members of the Indiana Graduate Worker Coalition voted to continue the strike into its fourth week. The vote, which saw 97.4% support for the extension, had record high participation with 1,132 members turning out. \n&gt; \n&gt; \"I think the (graduate) workers are fed up,\" IGWC media contact Cole Nelson said of the high turnout. \"We're now entering the fourth week of striking and university administrators have still not brought to the table any substantive changes, any indication that they are willing to meet with graduate workers as members of a union.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Since the strike's beginning on April 13, graduate workers have been requesting union recognition from IU and an outlined process on how to discuss benefits, higher wages and fee reduction with administrators. \n&gt; \n&gt; In response to the strike, Provost Rahul Shrivastav has announced a task force focused on crafting the \"ideal graduate experience\" and the reinstatement of the Student Academic Appointee (graduate student worker) Committee of the Bloomington Faculty Council. Shrivastav also has previously committed to a 5% stipend increase for all SAAs and a new campus-wide minimum stipend rate of $18,000, in addition to more flexibility in using tuition waivers. None of Shrivastav's actions have received support from IGWC.\n&gt; \n&gt; Indiana University's Bloomington campus has about 10,000 graduate students, of which about 2,500 are SAAs. About 1,750 IU graduate workers are part of the coalition seeking union recognition. \n&gt; \n&gt; IU leaders have rejected the demand, saying graduate students aren't staff employees because their work is entwined with their education.\n&gt; \n&gt; The labor strike will now encompass the entirety of finals week. This means many graduate workers will not proctor exams or complete grading for the undergraduate classes they teach or assist in teaching. \n&gt; \n&gt;   IU spokesman Chuck Carney said the strike's disruptive impact has been minimal, with only a \"handful\" of classes being impacted. \n&gt; Nelson estimates the impact to be more severe.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"We have over 1,000 graduate workers pledged to participate in the strike, several of whom are instructors of record, so entire classes are not being conducted during the extent of our strike,\" Nelson said.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to Nelson, coalition members are currently deciding whether to extend the strike into the summer session or have the strike stop briefly now and resume in the fall. That vote will be scheduled at a later date. \n&gt; \n&gt; **New grading guidance has IU faculty concerned**\n&gt; Since the strike began, various departments across the college have used \"contingency plans\" to make up for some graduate workers' absences, according to Carney.\n&gt; \n&gt; In an April 12 email from Vice Provost for Faculty &amp; Academic Affairs Eliza Pavalko, faculty members who supervise graduate workers were encouraged to meet with them and \"discuss any failure to carry out any assigned teaching responsibilities\" if they were not completing their work. \n&gt; \n&gt; If the graduate worker continues to withhold labor, faculty were instructed to document the graduate student's \"non-performance of duties\" and inform their respective dean and Pavalko's office. This move has been criticized by some faculty members as it could mean faculty must identify their graduate worker as a participant in the strike. There is a fear participation could spark retaliation that negatively impacts academic reappointments. \n&gt; \n&gt; Contingency plans have been highly individualized within each college to suit the needs of impacted classes, according to Carney. \n&gt; \n&gt; \"It's mainly really just communicating with the chairs, and what classes they know may need some assistance, but again, it's not been widespread,\" Carney said. \"It's not something that we think is going to really hold things up a tremendous amount. We'll be able to get this finished.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; In a recent town hall, many faculty members expressed confusion and concern over how grades will be submitted without graduate workers. All grades must be submitted within four days after the end of the term, per IU's policy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shortly after the strike was extended on May 3, various college deans and department chairs across IU received a memo from Pavalko detailing a new grading procedure for classes impacted by the labor dispute.  \n&gt; \n&gt; **'Not sufficiently completed' designation for classes**\n&gt; College deans are now responsible for determining whether a course can be designated as \"not sufficiently completed,\" thereby allowing students to choose among a variety of alternative grading options. \n&gt; \n&gt; If students are notified their course has received this special designation, they can choose from the following: \"1) retain the letter grade they were originally assigned based on the work they completed for the course; 2) have their originally assigned grade converted to an [satisfactory or fail] scale; or 3) request to complete the remaining assignments for the course and to receive an A-F grade based on all of the work completed for the course or 4) withdraw from the course and receive a grade of 'W.'\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Course instructors, department chairs and the dean are responsible for ensuring students have all instruction needed to complete remaining assignments, which must be graded by June 3. \n&gt; \n&gt; \"We expect to finish the semester and our undergraduate students will get their grades. Those who are graduating will be able to graduate on time. That, we're committed to making sure happens for those students,\" Carney said. \n&gt; \n&gt; Carney said Pavalko's memo provides more clear grading instruction and notes there has been better dialogue between faculty members on workload concerns since the town hall.\n&gt; \n&gt; **'No concession' and 'no recognition' from IU administration**\n&gt; However, according to faculty member Ben Robinson, this additional guidance does not solve any issues. Rather, it places faculty in a more difficult situation.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"It is a slap in the face. There's no concession. There's no recognition of this overwhelming amount of faculty voice,\" said Robinson, an associate professor and chair of Germanic studies.\n&gt; \n&gt; The memo introduces a key ethical issue, Robinson said. In order to recommend a course receive the \"not sufficiently completed\" designation, the applicant must provide a reason. If the reason includes a specific graduate worker's absence, it gives the administration a record of who engaged in the strike. This could potentially be used for reprisals, such as non-reappointments of specific graduate students. \n&gt; \n&gt; \"(IU administrators are) taking a blind ideological line: They want to bust the union,\" Robinson said. \n&gt; \n&gt; For Robinson, it places a burden on faculty to choose between helping undergraduate students receive their grades and protecting their graduate workers.\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition to the ethical quandary, Robinson said the memo's guidance also doesn't work on a logistical level. Though the memo grants faculty members the ability to gain access to Canvas for undergraduate student grades, there's no requirement in current IU policy that graduate workers have to record undergraduate grades on Canvas. This leaves room for doubt of student grading completeness, Robinson said.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"It is just ideological, and it's not giving us ethical or logistical guidance. It's a hollow memo, and the only way to interpret it is it's giving the provost level another way, potentially, of reprisals against units in the college,\" Robinson said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Robinson's department uses 19 graduate workers, who are all instructors of record. This means all 19 teach classes. As chair, Robinson has assigned all supervision responsibility to himself, so he can engage in an open dialogue with graduate workers and not pressure them on behalf of the administration.\n&gt; \n&gt; Robinson said he is not going to request any course in his department\u00a0receive the\u00a0designation because \"it serves no practical purpose.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; In terms of contingency plans, Robinson said he has received little instruction or guidance for grading that will help him and his faculty.\u00a0\n&gt; \n&gt; \"All these contingency plans are absurd if graduate students don't give that labor. That labor is irreplaceable and that's it. It's just not going to get done,\" Robinson said.\u00a0\n&gt; \n&gt; For Robinson, a better solution would be an extension of the grading period, which would give faculty more time than the four-day turnaround.\n&gt; \n&gt; There will be an emergency faculty meeting at the IU auditorium on Monday, May 9 from 3:30-5:30 p.m. All faculty are invited to participate. This is the first time in well over a decade that an emergency faculty meeting has been called.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to the faculty constitution, 200 or more faculty members must be in attendance to form a quorum. At least 800 faculty members must participate in the vote for a resolution to go through.\n&gt; \n&gt; The proposed agenda includes resolutions asserting faculty authority over reappointing graduate student employees, calling on the trustees to begin resolving the labor dispute by arranging elections for graduate employees on the question of union representation and extending the grading period. Another proposed resolution calls for the Bloomington faculty to meet again in the fall to review the performance of university officers in resolving the issues discussed.",

She wanted IU administrators to know her name to challenge the provost\u2019s suggestion that graduate workers could lose their job for going on strike. \n&gt; \nAround 100 fellow graduate workers stood around her, holding signs that read \u201cON STRIKE For Union Recognition\u201d and waiting for the vice provost to come out the door to dialogue.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cIf I\u2019m not fired today, we\u2019ll know the administration is bluffing,\u201d said Tian, a graduate student worker studying library and information science.\n&gt; \n&gt; The lobby erupted into a deafening half-minute of cheers and roars, followed by a minute-long chant of \u201cUnion Yes! Union Yes!\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Tian was not fired for going on strike. She is among more than 1,000 graduate workers at IU\u2019s flagship campus who are on strike for the fourth week after 97.4% voted Tuesday to keep the picket lines going. Tuesday's vote hardly differs from the initial 97.8% vote to suspend instructional duties starting April 13. \n&gt; \n&gt; Indiana University graduate workers continue strike for union recognition\n&gt; \n&gt; Graduate workers at IU teach undergraduate classes including lectures, labs and discussions, grade assignments and exams and provide mentorship, filling in for professors who can't regularly engage with students after class. Represented by the union Indiana Graduate Workers Coalition-United Electrical Workers (IGWC-UE), they have fought for years for better pay and an exemption from university mandatory fees, among other demands.\n&gt; \n&gt; The strike is headed into another week as university administrators remain opposed to any dialogue with the graduate workers over unionization despite promising one-time raises and a task force on IU graduate education.\n&gt; \n&gt; Two requests from this reporter to interview Provost Rahul Shrivastav for IndyStar were denied and referred to IU spokesperson Chuck Carney.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cWe are deeply disappointed that a minority of our more than 10,000 graduate students, and 2,500 student academic appointees, have decided to engage in a strike which specifically targets undergraduate instruction,\u201d Carney said in a statement.\n&gt; \n&gt; Recognizing the value of their work\n&gt; \n&gt; Graduate worker unionization efforts have picked up in recent years across the United States. Since February, graduate workers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Fordham University voted to unionize, while those at University of New Mexico won university leaders\u2019 commitment to negotiate a contract.\n&gt; \n&gt; A 2018 report by nonprofit think tank Economic Policy Institute attributed growing momentum for graduate worker unionization to changing federal legal landscapes for private universities, universities\u2019 increased reliance on graduate teaching assistants and diminishing career opportunities in academia after graduation.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cMany graduate students, despite being among the best and brightest of their generation, are not seeing a good academic future for themselves and are seeing themselves as workers,\u201d said Paula Voos, professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University. \u201cAnd that then means that they want to be paid adequately as workers.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Voos, who is a commissioner on New Jersey\u2019s Public Employment Relations Commission, said universities host doctoral programs in part because they need graduate worker labor. Large undergraduate lectures would be much more expensive to teach without graduate student instructors and would need to be broken down into smaller classes to accommodate professors\u2019 workload.\n&gt; \n&gt; Between research, taking classes, teaching and union organizing, IU doctorate student Pat Wall barely has any time to himself, even during the summer. Last semester, he graded a 10-page paper from each of his 26 undergraduate students every week for a senior-year biology class while supporting both himself and his then-girlfriend, who had no source of income. It was an incredibly stressful year, he said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wall receives $25,000 each year from the biology department, and while his tuition is fully covered, his university mandatory fees and taxes leave him with a take-home pay of around $2,000 for each of the 10 months in a school year. \n&gt; \n&gt; Wall\u2019s apartment in Bloomington\u2019s city center is usually dim all day. The two windows look into the brick wall of a neighboring building just 4 feet away. It was the cheapest one-bedroom apartment he could find, upstairs of a restaurant by the busiest street in town. His $800 rent before utilities knocks out nearly half of his monthly pay.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now he has zero in savings and depends on his monthly paychecks to pay off his credit card debt each month.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stipends leave IU grad workers struggling, hurts recruitment\n&gt; Wall\u2019s stipend is relatively high compared to IU\u2019s other departments. Wall\u2019s fellow union organizer Peter Cho is an instructor of record of an 80-person lecture, which he leads with four assistant instructors at the Jacobs School of Music. IU covers 96.5% of his tuition, and his work earned him a stipend of about $15,600 between August 2021 and May, leaving him with a $1,050 monthly take-home pay.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cho\u2019s stipend meant he had to take a second teaching job to make ends meet despite already receiving financial support from his parents. Other IU graduate workers said they sold their plasma to pay for groceries.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to former IU provost Lauren Robel\u2019s 2021 letter to the Indiana Graduate Workers Coalition, graduate workers on the Bloomington campus received an average of $21,175 in stipends plus fellowships during the 2019-20 school year. The Jacobs School of Music averaged $17,120. Annual stipends are calculated as 10-month appointments, excluding the two summer months outside a regular school year.\n&gt; \n&gt; The current provost, Shrivastav, has promised graduate workers a 5% raise, a minimum $18,000 stipend for those working 20 hours a week and more flexible tuition remissions for the upcoming fiscal year.\n&gt; \n&gt; Despite these raises, the new minimum annual stipend remains far below the local cost of living. A single adult with no children must earn nearly twice as much before taxes, or $34,586, to support themselves in Monroe County in 2020, according to the MIT living wage calculator. The $18,000 pay is also 22% short of the average annual salary of Monroe County\u2019s lowest-paid food preparation and serving profession, according to the calculator.\n&gt; \n&gt; Carney, the IU spokesperson, said given the minimum $18,000 stipend pays for 20 hours of work per week for just 10 months per year, it has the equivalent hourly rate of a full-time, 12-month employee earning more than $43,000 per year, much higher than the MIT living wage calculator\u2019s estimation of a required annual income.\n&gt; \n&gt; But Maria Bucur, IU history and gender studies professor, said it is erroneous to characterize graduate workers as only part-time employees. She said most of the graduate students she knows work harder and longer than a full-time employee between teaching, research and studies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Low stipends leave IU uncompetitive in attracting graduate school applicants, Bucur said. She said in this year alone, her departments failed to recruit three qualified graduate students because they were unsatisfied with the stipends. One took a position at another university that paid a $26,000 stipend, she said. \n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cThat's how we lose talented people who really want to be dedicated to knowledge making, which is the whole point of having a research-intensive university with Ph.D. programs,\u201d she said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Carney said IU operates on a decentralized budget model that in many cases delegates schools to set stipend rates with their respective faculty playing a strong role in making these decisions. He said Provost Shrivastav\u2019s promised raises will give faculty members and schools a boost in setting competitive stipends in their respective fields.\n&gt; \n&gt; IU, Bloomington communities rally\n&gt; \n&gt; Classrooms in the once-busiest buildings were empty April 14, the first picketing day and the second day of the strike, a testament to the importance of their role as teachers on campus.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wall held up a cream and crimson loudspeaker to his mouth as he walked in front of the 50-person crowd, facing Sample Gates, the landmark entrance to Indiana University Bloomington\u2019s campus.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cWhat do we want?\u201d Wall shouted.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cA union!\u201d the crowd chanted back.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cWhen do we want it?\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cNow!\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; The picket line soon grew to more than 100 people while around campus more than 1,000 graduate workers, undergraduates, faculty and staff showed up to picket. Drivers passed by the excited crowd honking their horns and raising their fists. Each honk met a long, collective cheer as the picketers waved their signs.\n&gt; \n&gt; An overwhelming show of support flooded Twitter and the picket lines, featuring community organizations, local and state representatives, candidates for congress, graduate worker unions across the country and IU alumni who committed to withhold their donations to IU. More than 600 IU faculty members, including 17 department chairs, have pledged that their graduate workers will not be punished for being on strike.\n&gt; \n&gt; On campus, many undergraduates voiced their support for the graduate workers despite their classes being canceled because of the strike. Their graduate student instructors planned and taught them classes that inspired their curiosity. When professors didn\u2019t have the time and energy, the graduate workers were there to talk them through tough times.",

He said it felt easy to come out and picket for his graduate worker housemates who he regards as family.\n&gt; \n&gt; In his email to faculty, Provost Shrivastav cited the strike\u2019s potential harm to undergraduate Federal Pell Grant recipients who depend on receiving their grades on time to prove their full-time enrollment. Sophomore Daniel Chval, a Pell Grant recipient, said he was angry about university administrators pitting low-income students against the graduate workers.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m willing to accept the fact that this might affect my grades,\u201d Chval said. \u201cI am more than willing to accept that if it means that the people who are teaching me and giving me those grades aren't selling their blood, aren't selling their plasma and are able to survive.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; What\u2019s next for the IU grad worker strike?\nMany have asked Wall if he was worried about being fired for going on strike.

He said the university expects to successfully finish this semester\u2019s undergraduate classes given contingency plans that the provost has instructed all schools to implement during the strike.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wall is optimistic IU administrators will eventually negotiate with graduate workers. Underpaying graduate workers\u2019 work for years is a choice the university has made, just as recognizing their union can be, he said.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cWe know that they can make better choices, or we can force them to make better choices,\u201d he said.",

This first working group includes 14 total members, four of which are graduate students.\u00a0\n&gt; * The Task Force anticipates finalizing the membership of our second working group on Health &amp; Wellness within the next week \u2013 with its first meeting taking place soon thereafter.\u00a0\n&gt; * We are fortunate to have dozens of faculty and students who have expressed interest in joining the working groups. As we move into the fall semester and finalize membership of several other working groups, each is likely to have approximately 12-15 members with representation from both faculty and graduate students.\u00a0\n&gt; \n&gt; I\u2019m encouraged by and thankful for the participation of students and faculty from across disciplines and programs. Their leadership will be crucial to the development of lasting solutions to the concerns raised by our SAAs and faculty.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Second,** I want to thank student representatives from groups, including the Latin\u00e9 Graduate Student Association, the leadership of the IU Student Government Association, the School of Optometry Vision Science Program, and the Latinx Law Student Association, for productive meetings this week with James Wimbush, Dean of the University Graduate School, and David Daleke, Associate Dean of the University Graduate School. While representatives of the Indiana Graduate Workers Coalition (IGWC) declined to accept Dean Wimbush\u2019s invitation to this first meeting, we will continue to invite them to forthcoming meetings.\n&gt; \n&gt; In conversations that took place both yesterday and today, Dean Wimbush and Associate Dean\u00a0Daleke heard a range of themes in comments from student leaders, including the importance of transparency about graduate student costs, the competitiveness of IU\u2019s graduate student stipends in comparison to other institutions, and the need for ongoing communication to students (graduate and undergraduate) about efforts to improve the graduate student experience.\u00a0\n&gt; \n&gt; These comments outlined substantive concerns and proposed meaningful pathways to solutions, all of which will be shared directly with leadership of our working groups ahead of their first meetings to help provide important context for their work.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Finally,** it is important that this dialogue continue in the weeks ahead, with input flowing to our working groups on an ongoing basis. To that end, Dean Wimbush and Associate Dean\u00a0\u00a0Daleke plan for additional meetings in July to update student leaders on progress and to hear additional input and feedback.\u00a0\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope to see even greater participation at the next round of meetings in July so we continue to hear a broad range of perspectives as we work together to develop meaningful solutions. This includes representatives of the IGWC and other graduate student groups.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is much more to do, but I am deeply appreciative of the engagement from our campus community and am hopeful for meaningful progress in the weeks to come.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rahul Shrivastav\n\n&gt; Provost and Executive Vice President\n\n&gt; Indiana University Bloomington",

            "comment": "June 30 Email from Provost Shrivastav:\n\n&gt; **Dear IU Bloomington Faculty, Staff and Student Academic Appointees,**\n&gt; \n&gt; As we approach the beginning of July, I write to share an end-of-month update on our ongoing efforts to improve our graduate students\u2019 experience and enhance our support for our graduate students and SAAs.\n&gt;  \n&gt; **First,** regarding the work of the Task Force on Graduate Education, the working group on Financial Support held its first meeting last week with 14 total members, four of which are graduate students.\u00a0\n&gt; \n&gt; At this first meeting, David Daleke, Associate Dean of the University Graduate School, outlined the working group\u2019s charge and participants engaged in a preliminary discussion of key issues, matters of procedure and process, and the data and research necessary to support their ultimate recommendations. The working group met a second time just yesterday.\u00a0\n&gt; \n&gt; Co-Chairs David Daleke and Marietta Simpson\u00a0have both shared with me that these conversations have been very positive, focused, and goal-oriented. They specifically mentioned that all members of this working group were deeply engaged in studying key issues and developing practical solutions. I am greatly appreciative of these members\u2019 sincere and serious efforts, and anticipate that their work will be among the first to yield specific recommendations for action.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Second,** new employment agreements for SAAs, which begin to take effect July 1, will now provide significantly greater clarity about workload expectations and responsibilities. This change is a direct result of student and faculty guidance, which highlighted concerns about the scope of some SAA workloads and a lack of documentation about workload expectations.\u00a0\n&gt; \n&gt; The changes to these agreements seek to reform past practices, establish clear and appropriate expectations of our student appointees, and create a layer of oversight to ensure that such expectations do not infringe on our SAA\u2019s ability to succeed as students.\n&gt; \n&gt; My thanks to the deans, department chairs, and the Bloomington Faculty Council executive committee for their engagement in reviewing and providing input on these improved agreements.\u00a0\n&gt; \n&gt; Third, in my previous message, I noted that we would launch a website to host ongoing information and updates about the work of the Task Force and its working groups. I am pleased to report today that this [website](https://provost.indiana.edu/resources/grad-resources/task-force.html) is now live.\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition to providing relevant information and updates, the site also provides an opportunity for members of our community to [volunteer to serve or share specific feedback](https://provost.indiana.edu/resources/grad-resources/task-force-form.html) to be shared with the appropriate working groups.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, this form is not a replacement for existing channels of shared governance, but a supplement to ensure that our community has a range of channels for engaging and helping us co-create solutions that serve our graduate students and SAAs.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Finally,** it remains my expectation that the Task Force will provide preliminary guidance or recommendations for action to address critical issues by the end of this summer.\n&gt; \n&gt; My thanks and appreciation to the members of the Task Force, and those who have volunteered to serve in varying capacities as we jointly seek solutions that benefit our SAAs and graduate students.\u00a0\n&gt; \n&gt; As we head into the weekend to celebrate Independence Day, I continue to be encouraged by your work and remain optimistic about the reforms we are pursuing together.\u00a0\u00a0\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n\n&gt; Rahul Shrivastav\n\n&gt; Provost and Executive Vice President\n\n&gt; Indiana University Bloomington",

It's at reserve on third, and is 570 per month + electricity. \n\nThe lease is for one bedroom in a 3bed, 3bath unit. It has a private, attached bathroom and a walk in closet. It also has an in-unit washer / dryer and kitchen. The location is decent, a little far but literally right next to the 6 bus stop and also the apartment has a shuttle that runs to and from campus pretty often. \n\nLet me know if you're interested!",

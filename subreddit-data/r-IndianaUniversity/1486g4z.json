    "postText": "The scene: OOS Kelley Standard Admit who would prefer to play it safer by putting off Finite and Calc until Sophomore year.  Intention to Study Abroad at some point (which would fulfil the GenEd World Languages/Cultures requirement).\n\nWith the Finance \"Degree Map\" in mind, that leaves a lot of spaces to fill: Finite and World Languages/Cultures (6 credits total) for Fall semester and Calculus (3 credits) for Spring semester.\n\nAny thoughts on classes to fill these gaps?  Doubling up on Arts &amp; Humanities is a possibility, as is taking a Natural Science class - but both would amount to only 6 credits.  Are there sophomore classes that could be reasonably pulled into freshman year?\n\nOf course, the need to maximise the odds of getting Bs or better is very important.\n\nThanks.",

            "comment": "In my opinion, it is best to get as many Gen-Eds out of the way as possible. Take finite at Ivy Tech, it is totally doable both during they year and during this summer or next summer. It is 10000x easier there. Calc I would recommend taking at Ivy Tech too, but if you have past experience taking calculus then the IU course isn't too difficult. You would likely study abroad your second semester junior year which completes your World Language/Culture requirements, leaving A&amp;H and Natural Science left. I would recommend splitting the A&amp;H to 1 class per semester this year and take natural science in whichever semester you have more space or whichever semester you aren't taking K201. Build your schedule in a balanced sense, taking easy and genuinely interesting classes to fulfill your gen-eds leaving you in the best headspace to thrive in the more demanding Kelley prereqs like K201, Econ, or A100. Since you need to get Bs or better, I would advise going light in general but if you are willing to work hard, you can definitely fit a lot into your schedule. You can fit in more than you think, but I wouldn't worry too much about trying to fit in sophomore classes this year unless you really only have like 12 credits per semester planned. Feel free to pm if you have any questions  \n\n\nEdit: I was in a similar place, and used extra spaces in my schedule to complete a minor in a topic I was very interested in, but that was probably a bit overkill. Freshman year should be about finding your place in school socially while doing well in your classes and adjusting to the work-life balance of college. Don't worry too much about filling in your schedule to the brim",

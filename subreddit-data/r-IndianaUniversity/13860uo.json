    "postText": "Hello future Hoosiers and Kelley students! Please read this!\n\nOverall, my professor for finite, Professor Neese, is a good professor, and cares about his students and genuinely enjoys what he teaches and I will recommend him as a professor. What I will NOT do is recommend anyone take finite at IU. I repeat, DO NOT TAKE FINITE AT IU. TAKE IT AT IVY TECH. I have never tried so hard in a class, only to receive an 85%, which I am still ok with. I probably spent an average of 16 hours a week on this class and had countless all nighters and headaches due to it. Professor Neese's lectures are great, but he does not write the midterm and final, which make up 50% of your grade. The tests and scoring for this class are simply unfair. To put this into perspective, I did every single homework assignment to 100%, this homework is worth 15% of your grade, and I received 100% of that. I scored a 84% on the first exam, which professor Neese wrote. I scored a 60% on the midterm, which he did not write. I scored a 100% on the third exam, which he did write, and I scored a 54% on the final worth 27% of my grade, which he did not write. I put in around 30 hours of studying for that final, just to get a 54%. The class average for the final was a 49%.  At the end of the semester, out of the 175 kids who were in the class at the start of the semester, only 60 or so of us remained at the end. Everyone else dropped it, do to the difficulty and absolute nightmare that was the exams. If that isn't a wake up call for the mathematics department at IU, then I don't know what will be. Please save yourself, and take finite at ivy tech. This class is fucking ridiculous and has ruined countless students GPA's and admissions to Kelley. Please, for fucks sake, DO NOT TAKE FINITE HERE. Please upvote this to help save incoming freshman.\n\n\\-A class of '26 Kelley finite survivor, and finite PTSD victim",

As a graduating senior there are some classes that you are going to take that you are really going to give it your all and might barely stumble out with a low B high C. Some classes are designed with the expectation that some of yall are going to fail it or that an exam average is going to be a 60%. Learn to be OK with just passing a class, and accept that sometimes you are going to spend 10 hours studying for an exam and eat shit anyways. It will save you a lot a grief in the long run.",

The general informatics plan is to take finite or a better math class first semester, which allows you to take more informatics courses second semester. I failed my math class first semester and therefore was not able to take an informatics class at the right time, so I had to push it down a semester and it screwed with my plan for the next couple years. Take it at Ivy Tech! I did and it was so worth it.",

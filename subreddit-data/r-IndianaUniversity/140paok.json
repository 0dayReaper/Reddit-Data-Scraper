If you're aiming to coast by college, go to a lot of parties/greek life, and have the more typical college experience Indiana then ASU and Indiana are really comparable in terms except ASU has better weather and wilder parties. However, if your looking more for a rigorous academic experience and don't mind being in the middle of nowhere then Indiana is definently the move. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn terms of standard admission, it's not too hard to become a direct admit as you only need to maintain a B average for all your classes which isn't too hard your first year.",

This is what IU stated in my request review email: \n\nFor students who begin at IU Bloomington in the summer of 2023 and later, MATH-M118 Finite Math and MATH-M119 Calculus are required for the Kelley degree but are not required to be completed at the time of application to the Kelley School. Students should work with their academic advisor to create a plan for completion.\n\nSo, you may have some leeway there. It may be different for other students tho so I wouldn\u2019t take my word for it",

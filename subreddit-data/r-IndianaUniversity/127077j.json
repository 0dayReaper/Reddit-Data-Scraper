    "postText": "Hello! I'm moving to Bloomington for my PhD and I was told that most foreign students get to arrive to Bloomington only one week before the lessons (due to all visa procedures). \nI've been checking rents and it's all very bureaucratic and they demand a lot of documents I'll still get. \nIf you're a foreign student as well, how did you handle this? Where did you guys stay before finding a place to rent? Any recommendations of hotels? I don't want to arrive and have no place to stay with my kid, so I'd love to hear your experiences with that. Thank you so much. \u2764",

I would choose classes based on what sounds interesting and then look at that website to get an idea of what theyre like.

However, you're other classes are up to you for when and who you want to take it with, depending on availability. Some people might take a not-so-convenient time fora better professor, and others may take a better time even if there may be a better professor out there. It all depends on personal preference.",

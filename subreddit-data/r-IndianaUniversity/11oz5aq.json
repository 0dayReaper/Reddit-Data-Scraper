            "comment": "Indianapolis hands down. I did research at the medical school (IUSM) along side numerous med students for about 7yrs and I think most all of them would also agree. The reason being is that you are in a very academically rich environment with the biggest hospitals in the state, providing ample opportunities for shadowing (helps faculty put a face to the name when making residency rank decisions). Further, most of the faculty researchers at the Indy campus are more than happy to have a med student work on their research with them. The students working with the PI who I also worked for came out with a lot of presentations and publications (again, important for residency placement - I came out with 9 publications going into PA school). I have a few more reasons for the Indy campus, but I\u2019m tired. Feel free to PM me with any questions!",

From personal experience interacting with staff and patients from these different hospitals, at the end of the day they are all really the same (yes, some of the more rural hospitals like White or Morgan certainly lack resources the larger hospitals have). While the new hospital is really really nice, it still doesn\u2019t have as great a concentration of the foremost experts in IN, hence why I took a lot of patients from Bloomington to Methodist downtown pretty regularly.",

I recommend posting on the SDN school specific thread for more detailed advice.\n\nOverall, Indy is the most popular campus for med students because it is the main campus for the medical school. Bloomington in the second most popular choice. Students have the option to do all 4 years at a regional campus or try and transfer to the Indy campus/do rotations in Indy during their 3rd and 4th year. The exception is Early Decision applicants who must stay at their chosen campus for all 4 years. Factors to consider are what scholarly concentrations or research you might be interested, cost of living, your support network in the area, and your preferred class size. I'd use that as a starting place to determine what campus you would prefer.\n\nIUSM uses a lottery system, so in most cases you rank your choices and they assign you a campus per their system. Even if you want the Indy campus, you may not get it. There are exceptions for some scholarship students and Early Decision students who automatically get their first choice.\n\nSource: Applied to IUSM during the most recent application cycle",

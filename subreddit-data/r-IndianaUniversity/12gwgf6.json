    "postText": "Hi, I'm currently a HS Senior looking to transfer into Kelley for Sophmore year. Assuming I meet the GPA requirement of 3.5 and take the mandatory courses and get no grade lower than a B in my business courses, how hard would you say it is to transfer to Kelley? I didn't apply to IU as a freshman because I was diagnosed with cancer and so it was better for me to attend my state school(UTD). But right now I am doing really well with treatment and will probably be really healthy by the end of this year. I know high school stuff still matters so imma list some of my stats below:\n\n**GPA** uw: 3.4\n\n**SAT**: 1400/1420 super scored\n\n**Extracurriculars:**\n\n\\-Interned at a Software consulting firm in Dallas\n\n\\-Researched the use of AI in autonomous vehicles with a Professor at UTA\n\n\\-Tutored underprivileged kids for free(140+ hours)\n\n\\-Worked on the outreach team for the underprivileged organization\n\n\\-Attended a BPA state-level competition and placed like 30th out of 150 or something\n\n\\-Worked part-time at Kumon(30+ hours)\n\n\\-Quora \"Influencer\" (Basically I am very active on Quora and contribute to a bunch of financial spaces by answering questions, posting discussion topics, etc)\n\nThis is most of the stuff I did in high school, not everything though. I know this stuff isn't the most competitive for Kelley but in my common app essay, I wrote how I was born with CKD(Chronic Kidney Disease) and how that impacted my life, and later how I received a transplant and how it changed my life and allowed me to reach my full potential. I would say my essays were really good.\n\nAlso, just to compare, I got into SMU Cox for Finance, Capped at UT for Finance, and was accepted into Rutgers for CS and Finance as a dual major. Would be great if someone who transferred into Kelley could maybe share their experience!",

    "postText": "My American girlfriend 18 F, thinks it's not acceptable for me(a financially struggling international student) to say that I struggle more than her and she tells me that the scales are equal in regards of struggles). So I'm going to vent on why we struggle more.\n\n1. Tuition and living expenses: Studying in the United States is super expensive for us. We often have to pay higher tuition fees compared to domestic students, and the cost of living can also be significant, especially in popular metropolitan areas. This financial burden especially makes it challenging for us to afford our education and cover our day-to-day expenses.\n2. Limited financial aid and scholarships: We have limited access to financial aid and scholarships provided by U.S. institutions. Many scholarships and grants are often available only to U.S. citizens or permanent residents, leaving us with fewer options to alleviate our financial burden.\n3. Restricted work opportunities: We are typically restricted by visa regulations in terms of the number of hours we can work off-campus. While we may be allowed to work on campus, these jobs may not always provide sufficient income to cover our expenses. This limitation on work opportunities can add to the financial challenges we face.\n4. Immigration regulations and paperwork: Navigating the immigration system can be complex and time-consuming for us. We need to obtain a student visa, maintain our legal status, and comply with various regulations and reporting requirements. Any errors or delays in the immigration process can create additional stress and uncertainty for us.\n5. Also, we have to go back to our countries if we can't find a job after graduation, no job guarantee.",

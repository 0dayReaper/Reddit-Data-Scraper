            "comment": "&gt; The Indiana University Board of Trustees will hold a public hearing on tuition and fees for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 academic years on June 7 at IUPUI.\n\n...\n\n&gt; Trustees will consider a proposed annual tuition and mandatory fees increase of 3% over the next two years for undergraduate resident (in-state) students at all IU campuses. The proposed increase \u2014 which remains below average inflation and lower than Indiana Commission for Higher Education guidance \u2014 would support faculty recruitment and retention while addressing increases in expenses for labor, services and other fixed costs.\n&gt; \n&gt; If approved, tuition at IU Bloomington and IUPUI would increase by $343 and $304, respectively, during the 2023-24 academic year. Regional campuses would see a tuition increase of $238 in 2023-24.",

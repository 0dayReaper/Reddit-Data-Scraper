    "postText": "Hi, I'm a prospective student who is looking to potentially attend IU Kelley through their direct admit program. As I'm narrowing the choices, I wanted to look into the opportunities past college that IU and other colleges can provide, and I found the Investment Banking Workshop part of Kelley. I also noticed a number of other business-related programs that seemed interesting. If anyone has any experience with any of the business programs, knows someone in one, or is in one themselves, please let me know. Thanks!",

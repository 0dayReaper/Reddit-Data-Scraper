    "postText": "I\u2019m a sophomore and I have more than 250 IBucks left in my account that will expire on December 30th. I\u2019ve tried to spend as many as I could over the semester but I still have $250+ that will just disappear. \n\nIs there ANY way to use my IBucks for anything?? I know I can\u2019t get a refund (as ridiculous as that is) so could I donate them or something? Last year we had the option to donate them but I\u2019m not finding a working link to do that this semester. \n\nI don\u2019t want so much money to go to waste, help!!",

Hi i\u2019m going to be a sophomore and I was looking at the IU scholarship page and noticed that it shows me scholarships that I didn\u2019t apply for on my current page as show below. Which also says not selected and not sure what that means. If anyone can help that will be greatly appreciated. Also does any one know when financial aid gets finalized since an outside scholarship needs info on that. Thank you so much if anyone can answer.",

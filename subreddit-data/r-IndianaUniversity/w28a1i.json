They are smart enough to recognize that Indiana is a very conservative state - more accurately, the Indiana State legislators are very conservative. IU depends on the state for funding. Anyone calling on any sort of official statement from IU is being more than a little naive. Just ain\u2019t gonna happen.\n\nBut OP is correct in my view that Robel should have been the new IU President. The BoT did a terrible job with their search and Whitten was a very poor choice. She\u2019ll be gone inside of 3 years.",

Both McRobbie and Robel put out statements that the legislature did *not* like. I'd be shocked if Robel as president didn't put something out about RvW, which, of course, is why IU didn't get her as president.\n\nEdit: although I should probably point out that what she's done here - taking action - is far more important than putting out a statement.",

There is no obligation to speak to the situation with Rokita.\n\nEdit: although it probably could be argued that the Rokita situation does actually impact the healthcare situation at IU... but that's not as clear-cut, and I don't think I'd call speaking to it an obligation for the university. This is on my mind after reading an article that IU's Chief Health Officer Tweeted (edit: written by a professor at the IU School of Medicine): https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/15/opinion/doctors-roe-v-wade-ohio-10-year-old.html\n\n&gt; Our medical and ethical responsibility as clinicians is grounded in delivering comprehensive, safe and evidence-based health care. If providing that care results in threats to professional and personal safety, patients will suffer. Doctors have sworn to do no harm. Clearly, many of those in power have not.\n\n(More detail in the article - this is just the conclusion to give you an idea what it's getting at.)",

                    "comment": "A former Indiana University provost and law school dean is calling for a disciplinary investigation of Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, alleging that he made \u201cfalse or baseless\u201d statements on Fox News concerning an Indiana doctor who performed an abortion for a 10-year-old Ohio rape victim.\n\nLauren Robel, who served as dean of the IU Maurer School of Law from 2003 to 2011, sent a three-page letter Friday to the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission asking it to look into Rokita\u2019s recent declaration that he was investigating the doctor, Caitlin Bernard, an Indianapolis obstetrician-gynecologist, for possibly failing to report the abortion to state health officials as required by law or meeting other legal obligations.\n\n\u201cGeneral Rokita has suggested no evidence that prompted his investigation into Dr. Bernard other than his political disagreement with her provision of legal abortion services to the child, as evidenced by his repeated references to her on national television as an \u201cabortion activist acting as a doctor,\u201d Robel wrote in her letter. \u201cHe has produced no evidence to substantiate his claim that Dr. Bernard had a \u2018history of not reporting.\u2019\u201d\n\nRecords show Bernard did appropriately report the abortion to the Indiana Department of Health.\n\nOn Monday, Rokita\u2019s office insisted in a written statement that Robel\u2019s complaint was \u201cwithout basis\u201d and said the attorney general is continuing to investigate whether Bernard was \u201cin compliance with Indiana and federal privacy laws.\u201d\n\nRobel\u2019s letter says Rokita failed in his responsibility as the state\u2019s highest-ranking lawyer to refrain from making \u201cfalse or baseless statements\u201d about the law or facts.\n\n\u201cIf he can throw the entire weight of his office without consequence to attack Dr. Bernard, he can do so to target any private citizen with whom he disagrees,\u201d Robel wrote.\n\nWhen reached by phone Monday, Robel said she was compelled to take action because she felt the attorney general of the state ought to comply with the same rules as all Indiana lawyers.\n\n\u201cFrankly, I think he ought to be held to the highest standard of conduct, but at a minimum he needs to do what all of us are required to do,\u201d Robel told the Indianapolis Business Journal.\n\nThe Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission said it cannot confirm or deny whether a complaint has been filed against an attorney unless it decides to file formal disciplinary charges against the lawyer. The commission said Rokita is currently in good standing.\n\nThe abortion for the 10-year-old Ohio girl has become a flashpoint in the national debate over abortion access. Rokita entered the fray on July 13 when he sent a letter to Gov. Eric Holcomb stating that his staff was investigating whether Dr. Bernard had failed to report the sexual assault of a minor to state authorities.\n\nLater that evening, Rokita made an appearance on the Fox News program \u201cJesse Waters Primetime\u201d where he claimed Dr. Bernard had a \u201chistory of failing to report\u201d and said his office was gathering evidence that Dr. Bernard, who has previously spoken publicly about her support for abortion rights, had failed to report the procedure.\n\nThe following day, multiple media outlets published copies of the pregnancy termination report confirming that Dr. Bernard had reported the incident as required by law.\n\nKathleen DeLaney, a lawyer for the doctor, has said they are considering taking legal action against \u201cthose who have smeared my client,\u201d including Rokita.\n\nThe 10-year-old\u2019s case has heightened emotions in Indiana as state lawmakers prepare to convene for a special session on July 25 to pass legislation that is expected to further restrict access to abortion for Hoosiers. Indiana Republicans have declined to discuss specifics of the bill, including whether it would allow exceptions for rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother.\n\nAs first reported by the Indianapolis Star on July 1, Dr. Bernard received a referral from a child abuse doctor in Ohio\u2014where abortion is illegal after six weeks\u2014who had a 10-year-old patient who was six weeks and three days pregnant.\n\nThe story gained national attention when President Joe Biden invoked the case during a July 8 press conference, and media outlets including The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal began to question the veracity of the story. The WSJ editorial was later corrected after the IndyStar and other publications confirmed that a 27-year-old man had been arrested in connection with the crime.\n\nIt is up to the Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission to decide whether the Robel\u2019s complaint against Rokita merits investigation and whether formal disciplinary charges should be filed.\n\nIt is not unprecedented for the commission to investigate a sitting attorney general. In 2019, the commission investigated allegations that Indiana\u2019s then-attorney general Curtis Hill groped four women during a party at a Downtown bar.\n\nThe commission recommended that Hill\u2019s law license be suspended for two years. The Indiana Supreme Court ultimately suspended Hill\u2019s law license for 30 days, determining that he violated professional conduct rules and committed the criminal act of battery. Hill has consistently denied any wrongdoing.",

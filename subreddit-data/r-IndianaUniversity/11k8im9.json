If not, NW neighborhood dorms are closer to Luddy. Even wells quad dorms are closer to Luddy. There's also other ways to get involved with Luddy that don't include living in the LLC. I lived there because I'm a mega introvert and wanted that built in \"friend\" group the LLC provides you. However, don't think that because you're a Luddy kid you need to live in the LLC.",

None of the people in my cohort were welcoming or reciprocated my attempts to be friends and always acted like they were more intelligent than us, you may have a different experience entirely though. The LLC honestly is probably your best bet as a Luddy student, one of your mandatory classes will be in that building.",

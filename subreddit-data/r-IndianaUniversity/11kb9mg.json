    "postText": "Incoming freshman - had to Petition to Kelley (Marketing) felt confident when I applied in October but haven\u2019t heard back yet so my confidence is dwindling. If my Petition is not granted, I\u2019m looking into potential alternatives that are within A&amp;S. \n\nMedia with Advertising emphasis caught my eye since I think it seems in the same ballpark as Marketing. \n\nAm I correct that they are somewhat similar?  Does it require artistic talent?  I\u2019ve taken an art class or two but am not an artist. \n\nDo I need to do anything if I decide to aim for Media School instead of Kelley or is everything fine since I\u2019m in University Division (pre business right now) anyway?",

I took some production classes just mostly Industry/management side of things. My emphasis was advertising/marketing.  I\u2019ve been working in marketing since I graduated in 2012.  I can\u2019t speak for Kelley, but I learned a lot of good stuff that I use daily.",

I thought the media school looked promising.  It's definitely worth talking to an advisor about or going and checking it out.",

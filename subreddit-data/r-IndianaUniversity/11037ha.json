Some big schools are struggling to balance higher attendance with availability. What\u2019s your experience been like? Is it easy for freshmen, but challenging in subsequent years?",

            "comment": "For freshman year, he should be fine as long as he submits his housing stuff early enough. At least for freshman year, since it\u2019s required and more tolerable. I would also avoid housing in the no-air conditioning dorms, they are in horrible horrible condition. I also recommend that he gets a dorm close to his classes, just makes it easier. \n\nAs for the rest his time at IU, I would definitely go off campus. RPS is absolutely terrible to deal with, extremely dysfunctional. Even in the apartments, they have pretty stupid rules and the management is a pain to deal with. I moved off campus because I wasn\u2019t able to do my schoolwork due to the rules, among other things. They also lost packages before and I felt like they just don\u2019t care about the residents. So I highly recommend going off campus after freshman year.",

A lot of my friends from freshman year didn't return because they couldn't adapt \n\nIf you have an option to let them have a little bit easier load their freshman year, take it.  Even if your kid was a AP kid with a 3.7 unweighted in high school they will likely struggle here because of all of the distractions and lack of guidance.  No need to prove themselves their freshman year with a huge course load that might screw themselves up.  Cruise into it.  College is a lot different than high school.",

For the first few weeks of the fall semester, there were 7-8 girls living in the lounge and sharing one (relatively small) room. I believe these were girls who were admitted later than most other students.. or they didn\u2019t fill out their housing forms early enough?? Anyways after a few weeks they must have been placed in another dorm because they were no longer living in there. \n\nSince then, I believe there have been many additions to student housing.",

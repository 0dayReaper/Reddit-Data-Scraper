    "postText": "im transferring in as a cs major for the spring 2023 semester but as a sophomore; does anyone know what dorms have a higher ratio of 2nd years to freshman? or if eignmann/read hall are good options--i saw pretty good reviews.  im wary of moving into non-university affiliated housing because i think it will be harder to integrate into campus but dont want to be living with 17 year olds",

They have great options and the majority of their audience will be more mature due to the distance from campus and the floor plan options they offer. My friends and I just signed there. All included utilities too. https://www.relatoliving.com/",

            "comment": "&gt; The Indiana Environmental Reporter, an independent environmental reporting organization supported by The Media School, will cease all operations June 30 following loss in funding for the organization. Originally funded by grant money and later by The Media School, the funds will be reallocated to support teaching, research and service needs, according to Audrie Osterman, director of communications and marketing for The Media School.\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2018, The Media School partnered with the Environmental Resilience Institute to launch the Indiana Environmental Reporter as part of IU\u2019s Grand Challenge initiative, a $300 million research initiative launched by former IU President Michael McRobbie. The Grand Challenge provided funding for research and initiatives in three challenges: the Precision Health Initiative, Responding to the Addictions Crisis and Prepared for Environmental Change. The Indiana Environmental Reporter received funding as part of this third category.\n\nWebsite: https://www.indianaenvironmentalreporter.org/",

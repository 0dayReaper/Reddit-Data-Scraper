    "postText": "The IU women's basketball team is having an outstanding season so far. Last night, [they beat #13 Michigan](https://www.thedailyhoosier.com/indiana-womens-basketball-sets-program-mark-for-best-start-in-win-at-michigan/) 92 - 83 in Ann Arbor. On Thursday at home, they'll have one of the biggest games of the season against #2 Ohio State. \n\nOne thing I noticed watching the Michigan game was the lack of attendance. Some of the crowd shots made Crisler Center look vacant. I think the box score said 2,900 in attendance. IU seems to be averaging something like 5,500 and hit 10,400 attendance against Wisconsin a few days ago. \n\nHopefully Assembly Hall is rocking and rolling when the Buckeyes come to town. This team is fun to watch!",

            "comment": "Yeah. Looking at Michigan's other attendance they definitely had a let down. They hit 10,000 for Iowa and Michigan State so to see that was a bit surprising. We gotta turn up Thursday though. So excited",

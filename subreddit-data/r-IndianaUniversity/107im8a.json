Female only preferred and parking needed. I'm a college student (UF) btw.\n\nFeel free to message or comment. Also if anyone has any resources that they can share to help me with this process, that'd be awesome (it's my first time doing housing that isn't dorms and I'm kinda overwhelmed trying to figure stuff out). Tysm!",

    "postText": "Hey Hoosiers!\n\nI'm a senior who was admitted into IU in November. Provost's Scholarships came out relatively recently, and I was surprised that I had received 2k/year. I had a 3.77 UW and a 4.3 W at the time of applying with a 1530 superscored SAT. I'll have taken something like 15 AP classes and 8 Honors/Dual Enrollment by the end of this year. I am still super grateful for the scholarship I got, but is this typical? I was kind of expecting to get a little more because it is purely academic. \n\nThanks so much for your time!",

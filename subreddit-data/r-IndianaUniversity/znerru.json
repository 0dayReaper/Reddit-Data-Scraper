If these posts *actually* didn't get any engagement/upvotes I wouldn't post them, c. \"We can just go to the IDS webite\" - Reddit is a *news aggregator,* and this isn't an IDS article.\n\n&gt; The Indiana Commission for Higher Education wants state lawmakers to rethink the formula for funding higher ed.\n&gt; \n&gt; But that proposal isn\u2019t being met with universal praise.\n\n...\n\n&gt; The old funding formula prioritized improvements in completing degrees. The commission said the new formula should be broader. Commissioner Chris Lowery said it should include improvements in the percentage of high schoolers who go to college, degree completion and keeping graduates in Indiana.\n\n...\n\n&gt; Ivy Tech President Sue Ellspermann said she welcomes the new model. But she urged lawmakers not to completely forget the emphasis on degree completion \u2013 which has what Ivy Tech has focused on.\n\n...\n\n&gt; Indiana University President Pamela Whitten said she welcomes greater transparency in how colleges and universities are funded by the state.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cI really had a hard time understanding the last formula,\" Whitten said. \"Hopefully, I was not the only one in that situation.\u201d",

However, Indiana also has amongst the worst level of higher education funding, ranking in the bottom 10 of all states in public higher education appropriations per full-time equivalent enrollment during 2021, as recorded by the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association.\n&gt; \n&gt; In 2020, when budget cuts were spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, higher education was offered up on the chopping block. That year, the state Legislature reduced the total appropriation of more than $1.4 billion by about 7% for Indiana's seven public university systems for the fiscal year 2021; it was later restored.",

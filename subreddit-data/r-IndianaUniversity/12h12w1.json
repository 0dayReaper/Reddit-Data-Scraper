I am interested in studying finance but I didn\u2019t get DA to kelley and as it is $55,000 a year I was wondering if it makes more sense to study finance at JMU for $27,000 a year. I will have to pay for most of my college and I want to know if IU is worth it for 2x more than my in state school.",

            "comment": "I have loans for IU out of state tuition. I\u2019m from a state with basically no good schools (especially for what I studied) and ended up taking out a bit over 100k in loans after scholarships and stuff. Do I regret it? Sort of. I loved IU so much and don\u2019t think I would have been as happy elsewhere. I miss Bloomington every day and had the best professors. I met my husband there and made lifelong friends. I think I also got lucky because now I\u2019m in law school with enough of a scholarship that I am not taking out any loans. I think that evens things out because even though my undergrad loans are higher than most, I won\u2019t have loans from law school. \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m only in my early twenties and I already have over 100k in debt. My husband and I want to buy a house and have kids within the next 5-6 years, but that debt might hold me back. It\u2019s really hard to make that kind of decision when you are just out of high school. You don\u2019t know what your life will look like by the end of college, and it can be hard to understand just how much money that is. \n\nI think investing in your education is worth it. But I also think it is worth it to go to a school offering a higher scholarship or lower tuition if possible, because the burden of student loans will follow you for a long time.\n\nEdit- you also might want to consider whether or not graduate school might be in your future. If that\u2019s a possibility, it\u2019s worth it to take out fewer loans now in case you end up going into debt for that too.",

I did, however, forget to mention that they have one of the most beautiful campuses in the country. Bloomington is an amazing city.  It\u2019s night and day compared to Purdue and West Lafayette for sure. But I stand by the fact that the university has changed enough over the years that I wouldn\u2019t recommend someone going $100k-$200k in debt over it.  And if possible, always get an employer to pay for grad school. I had my MBA completely free of charge while still paying off the last $20k of my undergrad.",

Also, my daughter is a freshman at IU right now studying nursing and she\u2019s planning on transferring to another school next year. IU has changed quite a bit over the years and not in a good way.  She sent home a letter she got from her Resident Life Coordinator stating that some students damaged some signs somewhere on campus (it was part of her dorm room which is a a couple square city blocks) and that if someone didn\u2019t tell who did it the expense would be charged back to EVERY student living in the dorm to pay. There\u2019s been other issues with the dorms that have ruined the experience for my daughter so she\u2019s looking elsewhere. The professors also seem to push their own political agendas instead of worrying about the students learning, which I know I\u2019m older but If I\u2019m going for nursing I don\u2019t care who my professor voted for. So if I was you I would stay I state and find a way to reduce your cost as much as possible while looking for grants and scholarships to pay for as much of it as possible. There\u2019s a lot of money out there if you are willing to look for it.",

A degree in UI/UX will absolutely not reach you the same stuff as a design degree. As a designer who has worked with people with UI/UX degrees, they understand websites, but that\u2019s completely different than graphic design.",

I have a nice job now and really enjoy my career. My design classes were fine, they gave me an opportunity to make cool projects, but they weren\u2019t super informative. It was more what you made of it.",

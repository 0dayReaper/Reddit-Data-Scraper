My internship rn is only people from ivy\u2019s and top 10 public schools (MIT, UPenn, UTAustin, etc) yet I am still working alongside them coming from IU. it\u2019s all about how you network and that\u2019s where Kelley shines imo. use the resources.",

Yes it\u2019s good, but it\u2019s not the best.\n\nIf you\u2019ve attended the business school or just visited you can tell where IU puts their money. The resources available to students are amazing.\n\nSpecifically for the entrepreneurship program, they are entirely student focused. They actually just announced a workshop for the entrepreneurship &amp; corporate innovation major. Doctor K is the GOAT of entrepreneurial teaching (he\u2019s the guy who writes the entrepreneurship textbook and basically started entrepreneurship as a major across the world).\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not just saying this because I\u2019m in Kelley, I\u2019ve spoke with Doctor K and other entrepreneurship teachers. They know what they are doing.",

Think the closest thing is an economics degree at those schools for undergrads. \n\nWith that said, it doesn\u2019t change that Kelley is a phenomenal business school and the school has a ton of resources for entrepreneurs!",

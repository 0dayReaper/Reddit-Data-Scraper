It\u2019s a panel of 7 or so judges I believe that each ask you a question regarding the scholarship, your life/career goals, and things of that nature. Each judge will tell you something about them that will lead up to the question. They start it off with kind of a fun question just to break the ice. e.g. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name and your favorite chips?\u201d Some advice: Research into the scholarship and the people the organization that provides it. It gives you an insight of what they\u2019re looking for. Also, at the end, ask questions about them or the scholarship to show that you care about it. It definitely was nerve wracking for sure, but take a deep breathe and you\u2019ll be fine. This was for the Cox Legacy Scholarship btw.",

But i saw you ask about \"weird\" questions and i don't think there was any of that. I think it was like \"tell us about yourself\" and all the normal questions, then the one i said above. I just remember that one bc i was unprepared for it and blew it haha.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am a researcher from the University of Maryland and am recruiting students to participate in a brief online psychology study. Here is the information:\n\nAre you currently 18 years or older and enrolled in college or grad school in the US? You are eligible to participate in an online study about mental health and college life during the pandemic. The online survey takes 15-30 minutes to complete and would be very helpful for improving well-being among undergraduate and graduate students in the future.\n\nWe are especially interested in the perspectives of students with disabilities and chronic illnesses, who tend to be underrepresented in psychology research. We would greatly appreciate your input!\n\nSee this link (https://umdsurvey.umd.edu/jfe/form/SV_bgE9szOlYuwv7Cu) for more information and to participate!\n\nThis study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Maryland. For questions, please contact the lead researcher, Dr. Rachel VanDaalen at rvandaal@umd.edu.",

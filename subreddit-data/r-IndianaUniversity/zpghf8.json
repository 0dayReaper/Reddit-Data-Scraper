Would it be better to take the X and retake it next semester for a better grade or just accept that I passed? I\u2019m not sure how much it\u2019ll affect my med school applications but I\u2019m also not trying to relive hell with that class again.",

            "comment": "If you retake it, take it with somebody else. Some other professors are apparently easier.\n\nA C isn't ideal for med/grad school apps, but it's not necessarily going to be the determining factor if your grades are otherwise good.\n\nEdit: By the way, many programs will still ask you what the grade was if they see that a grade has been replaced by an X on the transcript or it was otherwise repeated (many programs will use it for GPA as well: https://guidebook.hpplc.indiana.edu/resources/extended-x.html)",

So for example of you have a C (2.0) and then retook it and got an A (4.0) your GPA would average it to a 3.0. Given that, Id just reflect on how this single class affects your cumulative gpa and if you've been successful in your other classes and think you'll do well in your future classes, I wouldn't retake it. Orgo 2 was harder than any of the other science prereqs that I've taken and I wouldn't want to do it again LOL. That said, Burlingham is teaching it next semester and I've only heard good things about him and I think he'd be one of the best professors to teach the course in the last year or two.",

People who took (when I was there) Williams reported a different experience than those who took VanNieuwenhze, etc. (I don't know who teaches it these days other than apparently Williams). I had Williams years ago and I still remember that final being unpleasant and very heavily curved.\n\nAnyway, it seems like if it is still used for GPA, the effort might be better spent elsewhere to ensure good grades in everything else and an otherwise strong application.",

The med school application is all about showing how well you can do in hard science classes so they know you can work hard and pass med school. They don't mind if you pull out of a class and wrangle a good grade later. But if you keep a C (and re-take it and get the average) it's just going to bring your cumulative science GPA down. Some people struggle more with orgo 1, some with orgo 2. Don't have anything I can say about your professor as I graduated a while ago. Make sure to take the class next semester so you don't forget everything (summer semester at the latest if you want another prof), go to office hours and study groups even if you're not a huge fan of the professor. If you want to hold off until summer semester and take it alone, take Orgo lab in the spring if you haven't already as it's only based off of orgo 1. Honestly putting your nose to the grindstone here will help you get by in med school, it's a beast. Best of luck!",

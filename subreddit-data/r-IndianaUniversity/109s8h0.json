    "postText": "Hi, everyone. I'm an international student from IUB, and my major is econ. I have some questions about my two holds. First, let me introduce my situation.  I still have two holds that prevent me from enrolling in classes. One is about the Immunization data, and the other is about my i-94 records.\u00a0I now know how to remove these holds, but I know it's too late to start to remove hold recently. \uff08Almost on Monday\uff09\n\nI used to study at American University, and I transferred here last fall. Now,  I can't log into my previous university's account to find immunization records.  Due to this reason, I think I  probably need to retake the vaccination at the health center, and I think that will takes quite a bit of time.  Also, I have some problems with my i94 too\uff0c and my I-94 record is not consistent with the history.  And the CBP required me to submit some documents and they said the correction procedure will take 2 to 4 weeks. Due to the above situation, I speculate it will take three to four weeks to remove these two holds. I told the OIS about this issue, but they didn't reply to me. I know it's all my fault that I procrastinated all semester to take action.\n\nNow I feel very anxious, and I think that my visa will be canceled, or I will be dismissed due to I can not enroll in at least 12 credit hours. I  am also very worried about whether I can still have available classes for me to register after I remove these holds.  I know that it is almost not possible to cancel these holds during this week.  Could you guys give me some advice?  Do you guys have similar experiences to me, or heard of others with similar experiences?  **The biggest concern for me is that I could not enroll in at least 12 credit hours, causing me to be dismissed from the university.** I couldn't settle down and I want to find some solutions to make me feel at ease. \n\nI apologize for typing so much because I'm really worried about my situation. Thanks for your help and patience in reading\uff01",

Advisor told me that I didn't to be too worried about those holds.He told me I can choose the courses from the second part of the year. \nI knew how to remove the hold, and started to finish them.  To remove the hold about I-94, it need sometimes to wait. Also, I had joined into two courses without registration.",

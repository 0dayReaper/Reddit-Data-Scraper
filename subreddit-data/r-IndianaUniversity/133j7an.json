    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m really hoping to go here for undergrad but I\u2019ve gotten into my head a bit regarding if I\u2019ll be too old to fit in or have a semi normal college experience. So I thought I\u2019d ask all of you about your thoughts on the matter.\n\nBy the time I can attend I\u2019ll be either 26 or 27. However my life experience is largely akin to people typically entering college. Due to a rough upbringing and not being allowed to finish schooling, I\u2019m only just now finishing my high school program, and have never not lived with a relative. I\u2019ve always dreamed about going to college and getting to learn, live on campus, and make friends in such a setting, so I\u2019m curious if I would stand out too much or be frowned upon. Thanks!\n\nEdit: Omg y\u2019all are so nice and welcoming! I really appreciate it. This makes me feel much better about going to school here.",

If anything you\u2019ll just become the token older dude in a friend group of people 4-5 years younger than you. You\u2019re likely the only one even worried about your age. I\u2019ve also met guys that just came out of the military and are freshman at age 23-24. Just find a cool group of people and im sure you\u2019ll be welcomed with open arms. \n\nI will say do be prepared for kids asking you to buy them alcohol.",

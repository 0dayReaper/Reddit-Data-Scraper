    "postText": "This really can't be that complicated but we're still confused.  \n\nOur son is a US citizen but we live overseas.  Taking him to IUB in the fall will be a big, expensive production (which will get more expensive the longer we wait to buy air tickets).  It would be extremely helpful if we could work back from a known move-in date.  FYE told us that we can't lock in a move-in date now but they didn't tell us when we'll be notified of a move-in date.  So far, RPS has not responded to our similar questions.\n\nSo... when are incoming freshmen advised of their move-in dates and times?  What happens if you front up on the wrong day (we may have to purchase tickets based on an assumed move-in date)?\n\nAdding to the confusion... there is a likely looking link box on the RPS web page that says, \"Reserve your residence hall/furnished apartment move-in date\" but clicking on that link brings up only an error message stating, \"The form is not active\".\n\nIt seems like we're missing something obvious.  Thanks.",

            "comment": "In the past, no one actually checks to see if you're signed up for a certain day or not. Sign ups are more so they know rough numbers to expect each day, and things don't get too crazy. I would say if you know they are moving in during normal time( no early arrival or anything) then just book a flight and show up when you need to.",

It looks like the week before classes start is August 14th-August 18th and I\u2019m pretty sure most of the times you\u2019ll be able to sign up for are mostly the Wednesday-Friday, but you could probably come as early as Monday. If I missed anything specific, apologies, but I know move in time is the week before classes start (especially that Wednesday-Friday)",

            "comment": "Have your student contact RPS via phone call. They try to be helpful but are dealing with literally thousands of students with a small staff. If your student is participating in any early programs like Camp Kelley or IFS they are granted early access to the dorms. If for some reason you arrive a day or two before orientation begins, they usually accommodate with a per diem extra fee. Dorms will be open and have students in them who arrive early for marching band, work study job training etc.  Biggest issue in my opinion is to nail down hotel accommodations. Those get tighter with thousands of kids coming to campus. Same goes for parent weekend or any other big weekends. Reserve for graduation, I am not kidding, as soon as you are able to at your hotel of choice. For graduation the popular ones are 3 night minimum, no refunds and go for about $700 a night uptown. Safe travels!",

It's not like its a tropical location or ski in ski out on a beautiful mountain, but they get those prices and terms because there are thousands of families vying for very few hotels in the area. When your kiddo goes off campus second year, at least you can sleep there and they can hit the sofa! LOL!  Indy is only about a 45 -60 min drive. You WILL run into some construction delays south of Indianapolis 465 because they are finishing a literal decades-long upgrade making Route 37 into a major freeway now known as 69. It's literally been years of construction on the route from Btown to Indy but it's almost done. It will be a breeze once your kiddo is in their senior year or sooner! HA! As for housing move in, RPS will work with you. There are always families that have complications due to work schedules etc. trying to get their kids where they need to be, or if they have multiple kids moving into more than one university all on the same week!  They really just try to get a gauge on how many people to expect when. IF your move in day ends up being outside of their parameters I think they charge about $40 a day to go in early.  TIP:  Order what you can and pick it up in Btown or have it shipped to the dorm. The dorm mail rooms will be Swamped at move in, so bring or pick up the critical stuff in town while you are there as the mail room sorts through the deluge of shipments.  Also,if its hot, have your student go get their keys etc at the appropriate time and then go hang out somewhere, grab early dinner and come back and do move in in the evening after dinner, when the crowds are gone. Trust me, this makes it so much easier!  I can tell you that the Target in town is not physically one of the largest,  but from having a family member who is one of their national buyers, that Target has always been one of their largest if not largest back to college locations and they are well stocked. Same for the Kroger, move in is big business and the Kroger will have everything from food to mattress covers and decor. The Bed Bath and Beyond in town used to be. good place to pre-order and then pick up but they just announced Chapter 11 and are closing all US stores in about a month. There's always Amazon! Good luck and safe travels across the sea!",

If you are participating in select student organizations like, for example, the marching hundred, You can move in early, but you need clearance. You should eventually get an email with information on how to sign up for a exact time of housing but expect for Monday before classes begin.",

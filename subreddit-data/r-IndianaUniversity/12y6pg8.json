However, I have heard of some ways to get it to work - IUAnywhere and windows boot. Anyways, what do yall think if u had a mac whats your experience with it? Thanks.",

K201 and K303 are easier to get through when you have a PC, and it\u2019ll help you down the line if you decide you want to take more tech-focused courses. Plus, the adjustment from macOS to Windows isn\u2019t bad at all (I\u2019m a former Mac user myself!)",

It\u2019s a virtual machine though, it\u2019s gonna be a little glitchy sometimes. Get what you\u2019re comfortable with.

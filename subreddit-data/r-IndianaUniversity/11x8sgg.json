Daughter is in a position to take lot of AP credits into Fisher giving an opportunity to do pursue additional specialization. Thoughts?",

            "comment": "'18 Kelley grad here. My thoughts:\n\n\\- OSU Fisher &amp; IU Kelley will be very similar in terms of outcome.  Usually Kelley will place better for Finance &amp; Marketing but for IS/Analytics, you will likely not see a difference. \n\n\\- Disagree with other poster that Kelley recruiting is tied to clubs.. I was not in a club or business fraternity and still work for the company that recruited me on campus. There are many great companies that attend the career fairs and this is Kelley's area of strength.  \n\n\\- Columbus will have more opportunity for local internships compared to Bloomington (not sure if this is important to you)\n\n\\- I would skip the double major and graduate early or do another internship. I was in the same boat and it served me well to forego time in the classroom for additional work experience.",

Most business schools recruiting is through clubs and business fraternities which are super competitive to get in at Kelley due to the size of the school.\n\n.[https://youtu.be/7J-wCHDJYmo](https://youtu.be/7J-wCHDJYmo) Interesting presentation. Kelley is not Harvard but similar logic applies.",

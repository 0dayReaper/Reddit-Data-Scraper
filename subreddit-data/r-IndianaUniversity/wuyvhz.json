Rudy Professor of Political Science Jeffrey Issac told me in an email exchange.\n\n&gt;\u201cFaculty feel ignored and demeaned by her leadership,\u201d says Benjamin Robinson, president of the Bloomington chapter of the American Association of University Professors and chair of Germanic Studies.\n\n&gt;\u201cShe just doesn\u2019t care about faculty input,\u201d observes another prominent professor who asks that her name be withheld out of concern about retribution.\n\n&gt;Here\u2019s a typical encounter with the president, who meets with her vice presidents regularly, and select groups of deans and faculty members occasionally. Usually, all invitees are assigned a seat at a table. They are told to turn off their phones, and a sealable plastic bag rests in a plastic container in front of them, so that everyone can see that everyone\u2019s phone has been dutifully secured, like Crayons neatly placed in their boxes.\n\n&gt;Typically, Whitten forbids people from taking notes, and when she does allow note-taking, she doesn\u2019t allow meeting attendees to take their notes with them.\n\nhttps://thebtownbee.com/2022/08/17/is-ius-first-female-president-a-change-agent/",

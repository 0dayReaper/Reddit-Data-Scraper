You can DM me or email me at [christianbowdenart@gmail.com](mailto:christianbowdenart@gmail.com). Feel free to send my link along to family members that might need a little helping hand in picking out a graduation gift or for those that may want one for themselves! I\u2019m always happy to chat about different ideas and help you work out all the details for your special project.\n\n  \nA little bit about me: Hi, my name is Christian. I\u2019m a local professional artist with years of experience doing portraits and other types of commissions. I graduated from the art school several years ago. This past year, I\u2019ve been recovering from some ongoing health problems (lived in a rental with some severe mold problems and it messed up my immune system pretty bad\u2026 but that\u2019s a story that would deserve its own post\u2026) which makes working from home in my studio the most ideal thing for me right now. So, I\u2019m looking to fill my availability and bring more beauty to people\u2019s lives. I appreciate any support you can give!\n\n  \nJust mention you found me via reddit for 10% off! Thanks",

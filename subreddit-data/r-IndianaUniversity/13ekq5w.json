            "comment": "&gt; Thus it is tremendously disappointing that Indiana lawmakers voted late last month to approve a budget that specifically blocks Indiana University from using state funding to support the Kinsey Institute, and that last week Gov. Eric Holcomb signed it into state law. This is an unprecedented action that takes aim at the very foundation of academic freedom.\n\n...\n\n&gt; I am optimistic that this latest culture war will pass. And the Kinsey Institute will carry on. While this recently passed legislation stings, the majority of the institute\u2019s funding comes from outside the university, from research grants and contracts, as well as philanthropic donations. But I worry about what the future will look like, for our institute and others \u2014 and for the students and researchers who rely on us \u2014 should state legislatures continue to act on misinformation around sexuality.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some years ago, an Indiana University alumus shared with me why the Kinsey Institute was so important to him. He was a gay man in his late 60s, and he recalled how as a student in the 1970s he was struggling to come to terms with his sexuality. At times, he felt so confused and isolated, he wasn\u2019t sure he would ever find his way through that dark time. He was too afraid, he told me, to set foot inside the Kinsey Institute back then, but \u201cjust knowing it existed, that someone was out there searching for answers, saved my life.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; His words took on new resonance last week. I think about this story often, and I\u2019m reminded what\u2019s at stake when we limit the right to even ask questions.\n\n[Kinsey director defends institute in Washington Post opinion piece](https://indianapublicmedia.org/news/kinsey-director-speaks-up.php)\n\n&gt; IU has been cautious in its response. President Pamela Whitten made a statement supporting Kinsey at the end of April after the budget was adopted, but the university refrained from public comment while the legislature was in session.",

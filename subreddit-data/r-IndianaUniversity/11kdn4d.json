    "postText": "Undergraduate rankings for Poets and Quants for 2023 came out, and Kelley dropped 4 spots. It is one of my top choices for college, but I\u2019m OOS ($$$) and want to make sure that there have not been any recent major changes that may explain this. Wharton also dropped from its #1 spot. And yes, I know that I should not based my decision on rankings only. I just don\u2019t want to commit and then be unpleasantly surprised when I show up in August.",

What makes Kelley so desirable to recruiters is the rigorous curriculum and I-Core that makes the kids coming out of Kelley extremely well rounded. The workshops are certainly important if you want to work in specific fields (cough *investment banking* cough), but you won\u2019t struggle to be recruited. There\u2019s a good reason why we place like 95% of kids in jobs right out of school, and a majority of Kelley\u2019s are in any workshops.",

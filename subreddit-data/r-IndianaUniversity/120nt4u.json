They can link you to a lot of different collections, including the Lilly Library, which has a number of primary source works on seances and occult texts. The archive itself will have IU specific activities and documents, like these materials, \"Indiana University Folklore Institute student papers, 1967-2000\" which I believe will have some stories that you are looking for.\n\nhttps://archives.iu.edu/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;group=true&amp;search\\_field=all\\_fields&amp;q=seance",

Susan Alt might be a decent place to start.\n\nAlso looks like prof. William Newman from the history department teaches a class on \u201cThe Occult in Western Civilization\u201d so he\u2019ll be a great resource.\n\nThere\u2019s also an ongoing lecture series on \u201cOccult Natures\u201d put on by the Cultural Studies department. The next lecture is March 29 at 7:30 at The Bishop bar. Could be a great place to meet people who can answer your questions.\n\nSorry about my initial answer being so flippant, I misunderstood what you were after so I went off half cocked.",

You're not going to be able to find a successful current scientist who works on this kind of question because it won't get you big grants or big papers. Someone working on the history of science is where you need to start, as suggested by u/homsar06.",

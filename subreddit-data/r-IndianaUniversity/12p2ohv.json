    "postText": "Should i go to IUPUI or IUB for 4 years. It says on my financial info for IUB that i would have to take out a 2k loan to cover the rest, but it sounds worth it for the clubs, and Luddy llc. The IUPUI and Purdue collab is going to end but i can still receive a purdue degree if i attend this year. Would the reputation for a purdue degree be worth the decision?",

The program is much larger there, and as someone who graduated from there, I enjoy the connections and experience of IUB a lot more than I thought I would. Plus with the Purdue relationship dissolving it won\u2019t carry and weight by the time you graduate. \n\nAlso if you want to learn more, feel free to check out r/iuluddy! :)",

It sounds like you prefer one experience (assuming IUB) over the other or there's an assumption that the education is better. I can tell you that's probably not the case (or at least the campus alone isn't the reason why) but I can't speak definitively because I wasn't part of that program.  I do know they have similar (if not the same classes) and most of their info suggests they are 'multi campus' school which means they should have similar curriculums. Obviously, there's going to be differences across campuses (hell even on campuses there's going to be differences based on who teaches a course). Everyone has their own experiences, so I recognize that. I've met some very talented, great, incredibly interesting people out of the CS program, that attended IUPUI, so if you are overlooking folks from regionals, I would definitely encourage you to take a second look and consider interviewing them at least :).\n\nAlso, FWIW, I've rarely found that a degree is super great for assessing a potential employee. I don't want to take away the value of getting one, so I'm not trying to undermine that, there's just a lot more to it. Some of the most intelligent people I know do not have a degree, and barely graduated high school.  I also know people with grad+ degrees that I'd never want to work with, because they lack critical thinking skills. Especially in IT, most things we can teach (provided some base knowledge is there), so I worry less about the degree, and try to assess in other ways (though there's sometimes a minimum requirement of course).",

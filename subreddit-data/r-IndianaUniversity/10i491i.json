    "postText": "I got diagnosed with a chronic illness my first semester, and it makes living in a double &amp; communal bathrooms an uncomfortable experience. I gave it a chance in the fall, but put in a request for a medical room change (for a single &amp; private bathroom) right before the spring semester started. I was concerned about not hearing back from RPS after a couple weeks, so I called. Turns out they were having trouble accessing my forms. What bothers me is that weeks went by and no one decided to contact me about it. Were they just never going to say anything? I think I\u2019m on the medical waitlist now, but waiting is hell. I feel like RPS doesn\u2019t care about or understand the severity of my condition and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to make them care. Does anyone have any tips for dealing with them? Is there anything at all I can do to speed up the process?",

You have to press them for information and updates otherwise they may just ignore whatever situation you\u2019re having. Don\u2019t be rude about it obviously, but don\u2019t be super passive and always wait for them to come to you.",

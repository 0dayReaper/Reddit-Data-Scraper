Whichever one you like more, go for it. Personally I would think it's worth that risk, but it's all down to you and what you want",

Honestly, I think there is a snowballs chance in Hell that you get rescinded. If you wanna stick with asu, then go for it, it's a pretty good school, but if you want to come to a great school, I don't think you'll regret it at all",

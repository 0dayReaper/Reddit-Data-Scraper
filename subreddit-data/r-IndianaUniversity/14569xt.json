I assume colleges sell these lists or have partnerships with the companies.\n\nThe trade off is convenience vs price &amp; quality.  If you order these bundles, they come right to your dorm room and you never have to go to Target/Walmart/Ikea.  However, they're usually more expensive than if you bought all the pieces themselves and when you buy yourself, you get to control the quality of the merchandise.\n\nAlso, the bundles usually come with things you don't need and won't use.  Toilet brushes may or may not be useful depending on what your dorm/bathroom situation is.  Do you really need that neat looking steamer trunk it all comes in?  Where will you store it during the year?\n\nNow that it's so easy to order stuff from Amazon, why not use the bundles as a guide of what you may want to consider and then order the stuff you actually need/will use?",

Go shopping in person once you get to IU. Yeah, it's a bit of a hassle, but it's also a good way to start finding your way around. Find someone to go with you as soon as you arrive, and you start the process of meeting people. And choosing individual pieces will make your space feel like your own.",

Personally, I would double major within a school if possible. Kelley has a good information science/other data programs you could look at or you could do the MSIS program!",

Because of the way GenEd classes work, you\u2019ll have to take a LOT more classes than the average person, even more than someone who double majors inside of the same school. \n\nDouble majoring is totally cool and doable, almost 50% of the people I know are double majoring, myself included. But out of everyone I know, not one is doing a double major where one is in a different school. It\u2019s just too difficult for almost 99% of people.\n\nIf you\u2019re dead set on doing it, have a conversation with an academic advisor ASAP. They will be able to tell you what is possible or doable better than I can. Best of luck.",

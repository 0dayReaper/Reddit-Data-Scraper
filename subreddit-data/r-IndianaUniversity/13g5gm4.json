    "postText": "After looking through this Reddit,\nI have seen that there is a general dislike for Kelley students throughout campus. What exactly is the reason for this? Also, will I have a hard time making friends with people just because I am in Kelley?\n\nEdit 1: I didn\u2019t mean to start a civil war between Kelley and the rest of IU. I will say that it is kinda sad that there is so much drama and generalization, it feels like I\u2019m gonna be in high school for another 4 years \ud83d\udc80. \n\nEdit 2: Really wish we could just come together as adults and not hate each other",

            "comment": "As a student currently in Kelley, my favorite story to tell is of a fellow student who one day made a speech about how his family one time was at an all time low and we were all so touched at first. Then in his ending paragraph, he talked about how at their lowest, his dad had to sell one of his sports cars that was supposed to be a future gift for his son, and that his parents were devastated when they had to sell one of their beach properties, \u201cour favorite one\u201d. I was floored. As someone who literally works throughout college to send my parents money while trying to get my degree in this school, I quite literally felt all my sympathy for him shrivel up and die. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m a jerk, but it didn\u2019t help that throughout the semester he talked about how all his suits are custom tailored to fit him specifically and how he thinks our society caters to much to the lower class. He also made some other pretty unethical statements throughout the year, but nonetheless he is just one of the many super entitled kids within Kelley that make the rest of us embarrassed to associate with this school.",

Kelley students sometimes brag that they\u2019re going to be making a ton of money when they leave or lord this \u2018fact\u2019 over other students.\n\n2. Kelley students are often from wealthy and/or coastal families. IU has a pretty sharp class divide, so seeing classmates with clothes/cars/vacations that cost more than you\u2019d ever dream about can be off-putting.\n\n3. Business degrees are a lot easier than other programs. Your experience as a business major has a ton more free time than a STEM because you have to do less work to pass classes. \n\n4. People will brag about being in Kelley, which rubs a lot of folks the wrong way in light of #3.\n\n5. Business majors tend to be a little more money-focused and mercenary than other majors. This can be off-putting.\n\n6. When you combine points  #1, #2, and #3 you get a lot of wealthy individuals with a lot of free time on their hands, which means that often if someone is being an ass at a bar they\u2019re probably affiliated with Kelley.\n\nOf course this isn\u2019t universal, most of the Kelley folks I\u2019ve met are just fine- some are even great!",

I\u2019ve got some bad news for you if you think \u201ctop notch smart\u201d is what Kelley kids are. The word you\u2019re looking for is affluent. Kelley hasn\u2019t been a \u201ctop notch smart\u201d school for the past 20 years and it\u2019s because slowly all of the actually smart kids found better programs that are actually selective based on test scores and not how much money their parents have given to the alumni association (See the slipping academic statistics coming from places that aren\u2019t Kelley, the academic prestige they advertise is 20 years old)",

I am doing double major in both Kelley and Luddy. #3 could be debatable because 300-400 lvs for accounting or finance are actually very difficult, I feel like it is almost hard as 300 -400 classes in other schools. Someone did minor in Kelley cannot take those classes, and I believe people are making wrong assumptions that every Kelley classes are super easy based on their experience. Ofc, Freshman classes k201 a100 etc are way easier than other classes like csci c200",

I myself am a Kelley kid, and this past year I chose to act embarrased about it due to the amount of jokes I heard about \u201cKelley Boners\u201d. At the end of the day, it\u2019s your major and what you do with it is what really matters. I know kids who slack and skip class, and I know kids who do clubs and business fraternities; the whole 9 yards. All of them are good people, and it\u2019s rare you\u2019ll find kelley kids that are truly horrible people. Just make friends with people on your floor and try to be social. Most of my friends are actually in the school of arts and sciences.\n\nAlso, as a side note, just work hard. It\u2019s not difficult to get recognized in kelley if you just do your work. Many \u201cweed out\u201d classes that people tend to complain about (K-201 and Finite) are actually rather simple if you just attend class and do your homework. There will be a bit of a grind, but it pays off assuming you are truly interested in your work. Furthermore, don\u2019t assume that just because you are at kelley you will be a scumbag stock broker on Wall Street. There are plenty of good occupations that you can do. For example, more recently I\u2019ve been considering financial advising as a career interest. I hope to help people in rough situations learn how to manage and budget their income. This is (what I like to think) one of many somewhat honorable jobs following graduation. Goodluck and have a good year. Kelley is a lot of fun.",

            "comment": "A general assessment of the Kelley kids that they\u2019re rich, affluent and entitled. The problem is that essentially if you don\u2019t come to IU with your parents black card, or a full ride, Kelley likely isn\u2019t the place for you. Speaking with others from other business schools, this is becoming more common elsewhere too, but just from being a Hoosier, the Kelley kids are usually rich assholes that haven\u2019t made a cent of money through earnings, and that doesn\u2019t rub most of the people that have ever had to work well. Also, a lot of the louder Kelley kids are usually pretty loud about it at the Bars and Restaurants, and they\u2019re generally regarded as not very good tippers so just in general around town they don\u2019t get a good vibe. \nAs for the school itself, a lot of staff have migrated from the school in the last 5 years and the school is using a lot of their prestige to try and lure students into the school despite their departure. There is still many incredible staff still at the school but don\u2019t let them pretend that their prestige 20 years ago means literally anything about why they deserve your money.",

US News is a little weird, but they rank them #8 with a four way tie between schools like Cornell and UNC. Also, poets and quants puts them at #16 with a #1 in academic experience. It still seems that employers still highly value a degree from them, judging based on job placement and specific employers that I have talked to in Finance",

It's about the expansion of knowledge, and some knowledge just happens to be more profitable than others. This very comment shows why people have such sentiment towards Kelley people.

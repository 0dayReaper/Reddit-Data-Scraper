            "comment": "Yep, I met him once in 2014. His daughter was a student there, and I worked at the Tech Store in the IMU. He came in with his daughter, at like 8am, asking if I could help him with an iPad issue he had. I told him I could fix it, and he asked if I wanted anything from Starbucks. I told him that wasn't necessary, but he insisted to get me something, even if just a snack. So I said \"sure, a black Pike Place would be awesome\". So I googled how to fix his iPad real quick, did so, and he returned. And Johnathan Banks brought me a coffee. I don't think I let on that I recognized him, because just as a policy, I always treat celebrities just like normal people. No pictures or autographs because they get it enough. I DID however flirt with his daughter because she was very pretty.",

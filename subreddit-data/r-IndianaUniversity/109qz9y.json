So any advice on what I should try doing?",

That can give you an outlet to meet someone, and then meet their friends too. Also, try contacting the international office in your academic unit (Kelley, College, etc) to ask about their buddy program. The buddies are IU students who are specifically interested in being paired with international students to show them around, work out, socialize, etc.",

    "postText": "I got my final for Discrete Structures in a few days and my mind is teetering between thinking I'll fail and thinking I'll do decent enough to pass with at least a low C. Does anyone who's taken/is taking the class have any practice finals with an answer key that they could send me? I want to identify what I need to work on so I don't have to retake this hard ass, brain cell killing class and screw up my schedule for next semester.",

Got most of it down, although I gotta pay more attention to my first-order logic stuff, and I'm only quasi-decent at the word proofs.\n\nI'm confident I'll pass after looking some things over in my head, but that nagging at the back of my mind won't go away unless I see I end off with a C- or higher lol.",

I know for sure I got two proofs wrong, including the induction one. But i was able to give the prof\u2019s name and three TA names for the bonus.\n\nSo honestly idk. I wasn\u2019t completely lost but im anxious. It was so bad I didn\u2019t study at all on Monday for my next exam so I could calm myself down lol. Deep down I think I did well enough to pass the class but again idk. I hope you do well",

If you don\u2019t mind me asking, do you know if the smoking area had the same culture back then as it does now? I met all my friends there and we go and smoke there every day, and a couple of my older friends like to talk about that table\u2019s legacy of being the fun smoking area.",

This was Spring semester of my sophomore year, so I was already off campus, but a lot of my friends lived there - we were all heads, punks, skaters, artists, musicians... not sure if that's changed or not. These are the steps that face the inside grass area, which on a daily basis was complete packed with blankets, hack-sacking (it was the 90s), people playing music, etc. \n\nThere was no \"smoking area\"... people just smoked everywhere, including in their rooms.",

We recorded a couple albums, toured, and played a couple hundred shows total from 1993 to 1996. Did a bunch of gigs with ffudd. \n\nHere's our second album: https://soundcloud.com/showermast/sets/20_hits_20_stars\n\nAnd Collins was such a cool place and a safe haven in the early 90s. My kids certainly take for granted the personal freedom they have to be themselves, and that all really began to accelerate in the 90s - the 80s were brutal for many!",

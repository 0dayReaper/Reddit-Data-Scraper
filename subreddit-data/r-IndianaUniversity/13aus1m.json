The period is called Late Registration, and if you're a resident of Indiana (may not even be necessary)...you can just take classes. \n\nIf you have questions, you should be able to call Student Central on Monday morning, tell them what class you'd like to take, and they can get you sorted with a quick admit.\n\nNote, however, that this isn't the same as being in a degree-seeking program. It just gets you in the door. Once you start acquiring credits, you can slip into a degree program later by talking to the school or department that interests you.\n\nIt can often take longer than the traditional high school to IU pipeline, but ultimately, IU isn't going to turn down your money if you want to take classes.",

                    "comment": "Also, the reason I'd recommend just calling Student Central is that there are some hoops to jump through -- like getting a University ID number -- that can make it difficult for you to try to register yourself online. (This are more of those automatic pipeline events I mentioned above.) The folks at Student Central know how to navigate all of these systems and get you enrolled administratively.\n\nI'm old enough that back in my day, we'd just show up at Franklin Hall for Late Registration (or the Fieldhouse before that) and pick over whatever classes were left.\n\nThe great part about registering for Summer is that there are 4, 6, and 8-week session classes available all summer long, so if trying to start right away is an imposition, you can pick a class that starts later in the term to start your IU career.\n\nAlso note that starting on Tuesday, there's something called the Late Initial Registration Fee that kicks in for registering late. ($60)\n\n[https://calendars.registrar.indiana.edu/official-calendar/index.shtml?term=4235&amp;session=0&amp;event=0](https://calendars.registrar.indiana.edu/official-calendar/index.shtml?term=4235&amp;session=0&amp;event=0)\n\nI'd also take a look at this page on the Student Central website:\n\n[https://studentcentral.indiana.edu/register/late-registration.html](https://studentcentral.indiana.edu/register/late-registration.html)\n\nBack when I was younger (I grew up in and around Bloomington), this route is how a number of my friends ended up getting their degrees after either not being accepted to IU or delaying the start of college after high school. It's not really like a \"secret\" way to get into IU, just the non-traditional path.",

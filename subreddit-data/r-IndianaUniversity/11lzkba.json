    "postText": "Hello IU Reddit, I am currently filling out my Kelley Standard Admit Application(I\u2019m a freshman who didn\u2019t know to apply for DA last year lol), and was wondering if some of y\u2019all could give feedback on my 250 word essay, I chose the prompt: \u201cDescribe how a particular challenge in the past helped you develop as a person\u201d\n\nMy essay:\n\u201cThe world would be better off without me.\u201d It\u2019s a thought that has gone through my mind many times, over many years. Depression and suicidal thoughts are talked about today more than they ever have been before, but all that talking doesn\u2019t prepare you to have those feelings yourself. I can vividly remember the first time those thoughts popped into my head. I was 13, and had just moved all the way across the country, leaving my friends, and everything I knew behind. I was an awkward kid, I was so used to the people I knew, and being comfortable around them, that I had no idea how to make new friends. So as the first weeks of highschool went by, I remained alone. My thoughts became darker by the day, I went from missing my old home, to hating my new one, and eventually hating myself. I battled these thoughts for years, telling only one person. At one point, I even started forming a plan to take my own life. Then, all of a sudden, everything changed with one phone call. My good friend JW, the one person I had shared my struggle with, had taken his own life. After weeks of mourning, I woke up one morning and I looked around. I saw the deep blue sky, the trees whipping in the wind, and I felt the summer air, and I realized how beautiful the world is, and I thought, \u201cthe world is better off with me.\u201d\n\nThank you if you took the time to read it, I would greatly appreciate any feedback you are willing to give.",

            "comment": "I am so sorry to hear that you have gone through this and happy to hear that you made it out the other side. I was a standard admit last year so I know how stressful writing this essay is. What I\u2019ve learned and been told from others is they want to hear a story that shows you can persevere and make it out the other side in life and in Kelley, which your essay definitely shows. As said in other comments, they are definitely looking for the development of you as a person and the low word count makes it difficult to tell the story while also saying how you are doing now. The first thing that popped in to my mind was \u201cthe Light at the end of the tunnel\u201d which you could even use as your time here at IU and what you believe Kelley can do for you once college is over (jobs, connections, support systems, etc.) if you have anything like that you would like to write about. \n\n*This is a very personal subject and I am coming from a place of wanting to help you on your essay so I want to make that clear before I give critique about your essay because it takes a lot of strength for you to post this online. \n\nAs you tell the story of this situation that you went through, there are some parts that could be used to describe how you are doing now and what you are doing to keep yourself going which is something Kelley really wants to hear about. Even their pre-reqs are literally in place to see if students can make it through and thrive in Kelley upper level classes. Your essay could create a perfect bridge between your personal experience and experience in classes at kelley. \n\nI\u2019m a Kelley mentor and have been helping my mentees with their application essays so please dm or reach out if you want any help, I\u2019d be glad to give my opinion!",

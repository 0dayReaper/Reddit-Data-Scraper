            "comment": "&gt; Farley said he received support from other students on his floor and around campus, as well as support on TikTok. However, he said IU administrators provided little to no support.  \n&gt; \n&gt; As an out of state student, Farley said he felt paying $52,000 a year was not worth it when he wasn\u2019t getting the college experience he expected.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t feel like paying that much to have a really horrible experience and have administration just not care about me,\u201d Farley said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like they deserve my time or my money.\u201d \n\n...\n\n&gt; Farley said Dave O\u2019Guinn, the vice provost of student affairs and dean of students, stated he would reach out to Farley eventually, but he never did.  \n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, Farley said no one from the administration has reached out to him to try and support him or make any amount of change.",

Only care about themselves, and it's irritating people like that are still in power.",

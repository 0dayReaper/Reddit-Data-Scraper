    "postText": "Hello Everyone! My name is Olivia Leake, I am going into my senior year at IU. I am planning on starting a Students Demand Action group at Indiana University\u2014Bloomington. \n\nStudents Demand Action is a group of young activists committed to ending gun violence in USA. As a member of the Indiana University. Chapter, we will have the opportunity to share your story, participate in local events and rallies, peer voter registration, and more. I am currently a part of the national chapter so we will have lots of help from them as well! \n\nIf you would like to join, please fill out this form: [https://forms.gle/onXbJLFAM8GTLWbQ9](https://forms.gle/onXbJLFAM8GTLWbQ9)\n\nHave any questions or concerns? Feel free to contact me at oleake@iu.edu\n\nI am looking forward to starting this chapter of Students Demand Action!",

Just sayin... \n\nWe are not focused on taking away guns, but having good background checks and things like that so innocent people don't get hurt. Guns are the number one killer for teenagers and young adults right now. There are also other countries that don't have this problem. You know why? Common sense gun laws... and if you want my proof I can show you my proof because I do factual research on this stuff.",

Your best bets are zipcar or Uhaul.\n\nI guess the better questions is what you plan to do? Bus system is decent here and Uber and Lyft are options. There is the airport shuttle to get here from Indy. I don\u2019t know how easy it is to get around Indy but there are alternatives.",

Much easier than enterprise rentals too honestly.\n\nJust don't lie to them too much and say \"I gotta drive stuff from here to Bloomington\".

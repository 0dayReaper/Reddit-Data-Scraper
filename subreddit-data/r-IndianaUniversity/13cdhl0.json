            "comment": "If your looking specifically for a language to fulfill the Foreign Language requirement, then I'd have to suggest Norwegian. \n\nBefore transferring to IU, I attempted a semester of Spanish and had some experience with French in high school. It did not bode well, being that I've got some issues with short term memory loss and variable retention, which can make subjects like math, chemistry and surprisingly language arts fairly complicated. Doable, but difficult. A college semester in a foreign language will be roughly the equivalent to two semesters of a high school class. It would be advisable to start some independent study ahead of time if you think it'll help.\n\nI recommend Norwegian because based not only on my own experience, but just a general google search will reveal that it's typically ranked among the easiest languages to learn. The grammar is easy, there aren't as many rules about verbs and everyday objects often don't have a gender assigned to them. Many of the words sound and are even spelled similar to their English counterpart. Spanish involved what felt like an equation- words could change based on the number of an object or the plurality of people, both organic and in-organic items have either masculine or feminine connotations. There's also formal and family distinctions. I busted my ass in Spanish and even with frequent one-on-one sessions with the professor, decided to drop the class after barely staying afloat. Meanwhile, with only a fraction of the time commitment and independently I might add, I've been able to advance much further along in my Norwegian studies.",

Make a list of a few that sounds promising and then go to the grade distribution database and OCQ Student Dashboard on One.IU to see what they say as well.",

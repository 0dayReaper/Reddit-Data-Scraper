    "postText": "Hey everyone, I\"ll be transferring to uni in the US this fall and will mostly be majoring in Comp Sci. As far as the universities are considered I have got accepted to Rutgers, Ohio State, Stony Brooks, Penn State and IU. I'll most like be choosing Rutgers, but am still not very confident about it and considering  IU as an option rn. I compared both programs and saw that they are pretty similarly ranked.\n\nJust wanted to know what would you guys have chosen if you were in my shoes and also why.\n\n(Landing a job after graduation is a pretty big priority).",

I\u2019d recommend considering your current state of residence and financial aid options and weighing cost strongly as a factor.\n\nAnother factor to consider is what else you might be interested in beyond CS. IU is very strong in some areas and not so much in others. Cognitive Science, for example, is a fairly natural overlap, and IU has a very strong program there.\n\nFinally, you should know that IU CS has a pretty strong focus on theory, with less of a practical software engineering component to the curriculum. I don\u2019t think that tends to matter much when landing a job, though.",

Although I would love to have some practical knowledge and work on some projects too. Do you know anything about implementation of the theory that we will be learning at IU and maybe if you could help me understand how exactly will we be going about the practical parts, will it be mostly projects and assignments?",

                            "comment": "I think a focus on theory serves just fine for building up programming skills. You will get the practical skills to solve all kinds of simple programming problems, and complex problems can almost always be broken down into a series of simple ones, so this is a good foundation. Also plenty of chances to actually write code doing various things. What is harder to find is instruction in the best practices of how to incorporate your code into a much larger software application in a way that is maintainable. That, you will probably have to learn on the job. But every employer has slightly different methods they follow, so you would have to learn on the job anyway. And I don\u2019t think employers really distinguish between theory-focused and engineering-focused degrees anyway, they will usually treat CS the same as a degree in Software Engineering.\n\nMost of the projects you work on at IU will be pretty small - one or two week assignments. But they are real programming. Sometimes you will work on a much longer and larger project. Some classes will focus more on larger projects than others. There might have been one CS course I took where we didn\u2019t write code at all - Algorithms, since that\u2019s really more of a math class - but honestly we may have written code there too. It\u2019s been a while since I was there! Anyway, in almost all of your CS classes, you will have programming projects and assignments make up the bulk of your coursework.",

            "comment": "While I can't speak for Rutgers, the CS program at IU is solid. I'd say the programs at Purdue are more intensive and project based, but an education at IU in nearly any program is world class. You have to factor in quality of life and social aspects as well, which IU is filled to the brim with, and with Indianapolis being a stone toss away, there's no shortage of internship opportunities, which is a must for post grad employment. Hope this helps.",

They survey grads, and, at the time, I was like one of like 7 people who had similarly accepted jobs in the Bay Area, *over the last 5 years*. \n\nThe reason I was even considered for the internship was because the lead engineer worked with an IU professor previously at a large tech firm, and he appreciated that the program used Scheme. \n\nI personally believe the program is, or at least was, great. Many companies recruit IU undergrads every year, but if your aspirations are for the big FAANG (or whatever it is these days\u2026) types, somewhere else is probably best. That said, anecdotally, Bay Area companies almost exclusively hire undergrads from the ivies / Cal schools / very well known programs. That opens up a lot more with a masters degree, however.. something to consider.",

[csrankings.org](https://csrankings.org), which ranks schools based on the quality and quantity of publications (whether or not this is a good north star metric is debatable), puts Rutgers far above IU. However, there are some subareas within computer science that IU excels in, which you'll have to look into yourself.\n\nAlso, IIRC, Stony Brook's tuition is far, far lower than the other schools you've mentioned: if nothing else, far lower than Rutgers' tuition fee. Get this also checked out. If you were getting a similar-quality education at a fraction of the cost, you'd want that.",

Anyone who took CS at iu lemme heard from y\u2019all how did it went",

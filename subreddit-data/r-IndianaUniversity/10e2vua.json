    "postText": "Hello. I am a student at IU Bloomington and majoring in Biology B.S. On my Degree Map on the iGPS plan it says I need 4 credits of Math, but I only took MATH-V 119 which is 3, but didn\u2019t take MATH-M 120 which I was advised to do by the website this semester. iGPS says the 4 credits are required by Spring 2023 and I am also still in University Division, going into the college of arts and sciences. Am I going to get kicked out of my major? Can I just take it next semester or over the summer? Am I fucked?? Thank you.",

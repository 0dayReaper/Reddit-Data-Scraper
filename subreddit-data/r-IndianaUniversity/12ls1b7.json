            "comment": "1. My assumption is CS means computer science \n\n2. Freshman, Sophomore internships are EXTREMELY difficult to find. Most companies want to hire juniors (or the summer before their last year). \n\n3. A vast majority of the Fortune 500/1000 are in \u201cpseudo\u201d hiring freezes right now and placing interns are really the last priority, especially ones that are 2-3 years away from full time work. Unfortunate, but that\u2019s the reality. \n\n4. Not saying it\u2019s impossible to find one, but my advice is network in the Informatics school, get a minor in business through Kelley. Go to the career events sponsored by both Kelley and Informatics, leverage the career advisors they have in informatics that you have access to. Above all be patient.",

Use diversity of knowledge to throw a wider net. \n\nCS careers are how to apply tech skills to business to drive ROI and value add to whatever company/teams you\u2019ll be working with after college. You can be as good as possible with tech, but if you don\u2019t know how to apply those skills to be effective and efficient on various teams to deliver value, it\u2019s a tough sell.",

Yes, you need to understand the use case and the end users needs. To understand ROI and value add? What company has CS folks deciding on ROI and value added? I don\u2019t know of many job postings that are both a real developer position but also want someone with business analysis skills. Most of the time they just want a more competent, experienced developer.\n\nI would love to know this commenters experience in tech development. Typically as a pure tech firm such as a startup the CEO understands the business goals needs and discusses with the CTO the implications of making that a reality. The CEO typically has met with the CBO who has marketing, sales folks, customer support folks, and business analysts to gauge what would be better ROI value added. Then the CTO breaks this down into better digestible pieces for product managers. The product manager typically is a manager who distills these big ROI business ideas into digestible chunks for tickets.\n\nFor most developer/engineers by the time a ticket or feature reach there desk. The ROI and value added has been evaluated by more specialized members of the team. Your job is make the product manager\u2019s dream a reality.\n\nIf you just go in a completely different manner because you think you know what will add more value/ROI congratulations you just ignored the guidance of most of the team. You are often part of the conversation, but you need to listen to sales rep, customer support as they often relayed the real world customer implications to the product manager/CTO/CBO/CEO. Most tech firms have a long list of wants/requests/ideas. The CTO/ product manager allocate developers to fulfill these requests based on ROI/value added.\n\nI would argue it isn\u2019t in your job description to determine ROI/ value added. Your job as a developer is to be part of that discussion about the cost of different implementations and planning infrastructure/ major system changes for the future. \n\nI would argue, you would have a better career and earning potential if you just become a very solid developer. I can\u2019t think of anyone I know who ended up in MAANG jobs who studied business/info. Those who got into MAANG did get good internships, be a top CS student, often doing a lot of projects outside of coursework. Look into doing research if you can.\n\nCS is a massive topic and as you will quickly find the line with devops and It folks blurs pretty quickly when discussing AWS infrastructure/ pipelines, Dev ops. Learning these thing will make you a better developer.\n\nWe have a senior consultant developer on our team who attends almost no meetings. She has a lot of MAANG experience and her only goal is to get scalable code as decided by the product manager with constraints and code review by the CTO. She doesn\u2019t even sit in for most of the discussion about ROI as it would be a waste of her time.\n\nMy suggestion to you is go for pure CS, work on pet projects(not a full startup but a tiny game/website/mod). Learn about infrastructure as that will have implications.\n\nI was an info major, network tech cognate, Cs minor. I\u2019ll be honest informatics is mostly a joke. Yeah they teach you a little of everything but your career is often decided upon which job you get out of school and start gaining specialized experience in. \n\nIf you want to be a developer go CS. If you want do anything non-dev do info/bus. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are so many roles nowadays such as Ux designer, Cloud Ops specialist, customer success manager, development support engineer that fall into this non-dev category.\n\nThat\u2019s my two cents.",

            "comment": "In my experience, I\u2019ve seen a combination of local and non-local jobs and internships. During the career fair, typically employers are looking for part time employees during the academic year. These jobs are 99% local, if not more. \n\nFor internships, employers are kinda all over the place in terms of location. I\u2019ve seen anywhere from California to Indianapolis to NYC. This will be dependent on what sector and industry you want to work in, so YMMV",

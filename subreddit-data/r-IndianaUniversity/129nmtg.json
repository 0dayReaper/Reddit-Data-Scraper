It\u2019s okay I promise I know lots of people that either didn\u2019t get direct admit into their field or went in not looking for direct admit and came out with everything they wanted and of course then there are those people who get in their direct admit and then decide to literally turn their lives upside down and go down a COMPLETELY different path and still yet are so so happy.

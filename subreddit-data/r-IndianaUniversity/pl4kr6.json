                            "comment": "Just a point of clarification - the Internet is more than passable at IU. It's actually pretty stellar. \n\nThe problem is the Wi-Fi. It's not as simple as setting up a public network in a Starbucks. There are technical hurdles that get introduced with trying to provide wireless access to such a large enterprise, and being able to do it securely. All of the layers of security add overhead to the network that you wouldn't see on an open, public network. \n\nThis isn't a problem specific to IU - I used to be part of a community of Big Ten IT support people, and most of the Big Ten schools met monthly over a video conference. I was on it for about 5 years and every single year, nearly every school reported how much trouble they had with their wireless network - especially near the start of the semester.\n\nMoral of the story:  Wi-Fi is not a perfect technology, and sometimes just sucks for large, complex environments like universities - unless you throw mountains of money at it. A wired connection is always preferable, if your device supports it. It's not only stable, but the speeds are faster by a mile.",

Since the incoming classes keep getting bigger and the number of devices increase the load grows.

    "postText": "So I\u2019m from TX. got into IU, but not Kelley as a direct admit. my in state options are pretty much UT Dallas and university of houston, both in the business schools as well. Cost aside, IU is the school I most want to attend. I wouldn\u2019t mind UTD/UH, but I honestly wouldn\u2019t exactly look forward to going to either. IU seems like more of my vibe and Kelley is a far superior school. Thing is, I haven\u2019t actually gotten Kelley (yet). I\u2019m leaning towards UTD, but what would be yalls advice? is the slight risk of not making Kelley + the extra cost worth the reward of a Kelley degree over a UTD one? appreciate any response! \n\nFinancially, since my parents are paying I\u2019ll probably graduate from a Texas school with zero or close to 0 debt and an out of state school with maybe a years worth of debt ish, for context",

A Kelley degree does have a strong national profile overall, but more in Chicago than anywhere else. I think you are looking at two good decisions, and obviously, if you\u2019re asking people on an IU forum if you should go to IU, you\u2019re going to get one and only one answer.",

You\u2019ll get a terrific education, obviously, but if you\u2019re sure you want to go back to Texas, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d go to Kelley just for the name.",

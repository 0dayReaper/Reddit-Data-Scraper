    "postText": "\n\nHello,\n\nI was recently accepted to the Kelley Direct Online MBA. I was looking to see if anyone can provide some insight on the residency required at the beginning of the program. What\u2019s it like? Where do the students stay for that week in terms of accommodations?\n\nAlso how would you say the online MBA is compared to the full-time MBA experience?\n\nBackground: I live in Hawaii so business schooling is hard to come by, I am pretty much locked here due owning a home that I can\u2019t sell yet haha!\n\nAlso not gonna lie, I am pretty nervous about actually going to a campus. I joined the military right after high school and got my undergrad from an online program as well so I have never actually been to a campus.\n\nThanks for any insight.",

They put me up in a hotel downtown Bloomington with a bunch of other students and had a shuttle bus running for class. The class is good, great networking and helps put a face to name for the cohort.\n\nIt's not overly stressful and I felt it was a worthwhile use of my time and tuition.",

It\u2019s been an incredible experience, I did experience what it was like to be part of an in person MBA network during my time at UC Berkeley doing my other masters degree. The big difference is in person you\u2019re networking all the time and honing in on in-person skills. Depending on your major KD is all about remote teaming. Everyone is working and going to school so networking happens more organically and in spurts. You end up with a far more diverse network though and learn from/collaborate with people further along in their careers. People tend to choose online when they\u2019re doing well. Lots of folks have advanced degrees, there are plenty of PhDs, doctors, and everything in between. You will work with people from all over the world in most functions you can think of. Are all those connections as deep as you\u2019d make if you were just in one place for school, maybe, maybe not. \n\nKelley really is stronger than my other experience with faculty involvement and teaching. The professors love KD students and it shows, they make time for students and their interests which is amazing and unique relative to many top tier programs. Most classes were phenomenal, it is rare to find a professor going through the motions. If they are teaching KD classes generally it means they are incredibly passionate about helping students learn and develop their careers. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work on 5 or so live cases.  \n\nI was able to pivot into consulting, the program delivered on everything, the professors are incredibly helpful, and classmates are very knowledgeable. \n\nThe cohort I was in overall could rival any top program, I have made some good friends and learned from incredible people. Be prepared to put in some solid work, it\u2019s an experiential MBA degree, there will be work.    \n\nGoing to campus was awesome I only wish I could\u2019ve gone more. They pay hotel, best way from Hawaii is through Vegas. Go to Vegas Hotwire a night of hotel and Southwest it to Indy. You are basically put together with groups and presented with a challenge then have to work through it and present. Everyone is nervous and it\u2019s a fantastic experience well worth the effort. \n\nWe are also trying to put together a network of Kelleys and alums out here, complete with networking events, there are a handful of us. \n\nI hope this helps, and if you have any other questions feel free to ask.",

    "postText": "One of the strongest earthquakes to hit the region in a century shook residents from their beds at around 4 a.m. on Monday in Southeastern Turkey, causing widespread damage, destruction, and loss of life. Many people have lost their homes and are in dire need of food, shelter, and medical assistance. The situation is terrible, and we need to act quickly to help those in need.\n\nThis is where you come in. Your contribution, no matter how big or small, can make a difference in the lives of those affected by the earthquake. All proceeds from this GoFundMe campaign will provide those affected with food, shelter, and medical assistance.\n\nWe understand that times are tough, and we are all facing our own challenges, but if you can donate, it would be greatly appreciated. Please share this campaign with your friends and family if you cannot donate. Every little bit helps.\n\nWe will transfer the donations to [AHBAP](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fahbap.org%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0cnmlp_E-LI8Dy54OU8JpYLwV1iA-eaKQuAm6f_-u9KpaxaubrDs_nvPQ&amp;h=AT0XAAmx_rkFhe8PMbaF_c-Aho2j7Dy8ax45U0Ov4bRCawUxfVuFJdiz6YxnYWw1jH_At0BcwR_H_yAgxoscyyhRD-bPSi6crPlKAfA-0w-tKIG0K-JbequszhE_IZ8FSrRfI9I51A&amp;__tn__=-UK-R&amp;c[0]=AT3GfSU0j7vrP_SvAveL6ay6VIClj-iLcY7LUOBf7tXwpUxaEaG7tTEItD-7zZWL4zMsBMSahDum2VeN65XyN9_FpWUd8S89xHW-n5NzOgJXumrSp60tYW0yWrP-hNacfxq6h60_YRq3eohRqVowBw5QAzJGtMz-ciIZryumKOZS-PIO5UYC0p-HzagXK_cizXy1jVj4lQ8odi7Xm3kf1nY), a well-known, trustworthy, and transparent Turkish non-profit organization that has been actively working in the distribution of earthquake relief since a major earthquake devastated more than ten cities in southeastern Turkey.\n\nTogether, we can make a difference and help those in need.

            "comment": "My personal opinions on all of their statements\n\nKornberg: I agree with his first sentence especially in a university context. But there is a trade off there. Unions, like everything else that affects a Free Market (defined term) obviously offset equilibrium and some small businesses wouldn't be able to exist if faced against unions. Some may say that's a good thing that my local mom n' pop shop can't underpay its employees, some say its a bad thing that the local mom n' pop can't exist because it isn't profitable without underpaying employees. The correct answer, I believe, is somewhere in the middle. \n\nHowever his second half I think is good sounding nonsense. It sounds like a heavy hitting question but in reality what does \"compensated fairly\" even mean. Its arguable that fair compensation is what the person agreed to, which would then make the answer to his question \"yes\". Its arguable that fair compensation is market rate, so do we have to compare every janitor across the country on income and cost of living and determine if ours are fair in context? Its arguable that fair compensation is X amount that is needed to live comfortably. Can we afford that? If we can't, do we need to fire people or cut things to make up extra salary room? If we do that, are we then asking people to do more to cover the missing people and therefore they should have a higher compensation? If the final answer to that chain of questions is that we can't afford to pay janitors X amount, do we need to shut down the whole university system? Just not a lot for me personally to grab on to in that quote as far as substantive decision making and instead just seems like populist pandering. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWinston: Just a boneheaded thing to say. Comes off as complete right wing pandering. Outcome determined decision making as opposed to process. By that I mean she clearly hates unions so even the mention of it to her gets a \"no\" regardless of the context of the question. The funny thing is she says it could be \"worked out\" as in negotiated, as in what a union does for people, but she expects the people to do it as unorganized individuals. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKunkel: Even more braindead. The easy way to dodge a question without saying anything. How much more does he need to prepare before giving even a small portion of an opinion on unions? If he wants more info for the specific graduates and their jobs they are pursuing, and the budget and all that fine I get it, but its like an N/A response that comes off scared.\n\nIn sum, I kinda hate them all.",

            "comment": "/u/printpaperr has been plastering this and another post all over Indiana related subs (see for yourself) and Winston's position seems to be pretty deeply misrepresented. They edited her comment to exclude 'I'm not totally opposed to a union' and instead put 3 dots in its place. Seems relevant.\n\nFWIW, I've never heard of any of these people before this morning. But this bullshit just rubbed me the wrong way.\n\n&gt; [According to Winston](https://www.heraldtimesonline.com/story/news/education/campus/2022/06/09/indiana-university-alumni-vote-board-trustees-member/7467555001/), the biggest challenge IU is facing right now is the graduate worker labor dispute. \n&gt; \n&gt; In April, many student graduate workers went on a labor strike for four weeks, requesting union recognition from the IU administration and an official process to discuss benefits, higher wages and fee reduction.\n&gt; \n&gt; In response, Provost Rahul Shrivastav announced a series of changes and new initiatives, including a higher stipend and a specialized task force, but administrators and the board of trustees have been steadfast in rejecting unionization efforts. \n&gt; \n&gt; As a longtime member of the Bloomington faculty, Winston noted this labor dispute has been brewing for several years, and it should have been resolved way before it recently came to a head.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to Winston, there needs to be immediate action and negotiation on both sides, but a union isn't the only way to go.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"I'm not pro-union. I'm not totally opposed to a union,\" Winston said. \"This could be worked out so that unions don't have to be involved.\" \n&gt; \n&gt; Winston said she isn't a fan of unions because it puts a third party in between students and administrators. She also said the IU graduate workers should have assembled under an academic union rather than the United Electrical Workers, an independent democratic labor union.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"The reason the graduate students that are very pro-union are that way is because they have been let down in the past,\" Winston said. \"I think that we're at the point now where action needs to replace promises.\" \n&gt; \n&gt; Winston noted all of the administrators' long-term plans to update the gradate experience are good, but \"the students want to see something done now.\" \n&gt; \n&gt; After reading the trustees' letter, Winston \"can't foresee how they're planning to get to a fair and expeditious solution.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; If she is elected to the board, Winston said she'd like to talk to IU's peer universities in the Big Ten Academic Alliance, some of whom have a graduate student union, and meet directly with Indiana Graduate Workers Coalition's bargaining committee.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"I feel strongly that everybody should be paid fairly,\" Winston said.",

    "postText": "I am currently a freshman in the Kelley School of Business here at IUB, and everyone I've talked to stresses the importance of internships, but they never say how many I should have. I went to the UCS, and they said for my first internship between freshmen and sophomore year, I should try to get a local internship back home through a family friend, something that isn't that prestigious or formal (since I still have very basic business knowledge). How important is it to have an internship this summer, and how many should I aim to complete during my college career?",

Personally I\u2019ve seen people have like 2-3 internships and have fine careers. You\u2019re also a freshman so don\u2019t overwork yourself, have a little bit of fun but also balance as well. If anything, you should use this time to figure out what you want to do rather than specialize immediately. Build out your LinkedIn profile and start reaching out to people, learn how to be professional, learn how to TALK to people.\n\nThere\u2019s gonna be a lot of people out there who might have it easy, might not have it easy\u2026 don\u2019t focus on that either, no use on comparing yourself to someone who could be in a completely different stage in life.",

Right now it\u2019s way more important to figure out what you want to do and what skills you need to do it versus trying to get as many internships as possible.",

Personally, I decided to not do an internship sophomore - junior year since there are still extremely limited options that aren\u2019t a great experience anyway. I\u2019ve done more than fine in my post kelley career having done only one internship that I chose to work on specific skills I wanted improved.\n\nReally don\u2019t overthink things, pick what\u2019s right for you/ the career path you any and things will be fine. Having good grades and performing well is much more important imo than having 1, 2, 3, or 8 internships.",

J-S internships are pretty much \u201crequired\u201d to get a good job while a sophomore-junior one is for great jobs/IB/prestigious jobs. For freshman summer just be employed somewhere doing something and focus on volunteering or maybe shadowing some local businessman. Also see if there are any major companies doing summer seminars/camps/lectures for freshman that you can attend.",

If you have a mentor in Kelley, ask them too.\n\nIf you want your resume to be glorious, find a student org you like and work hard at that. Be the person that\u2019s not a general member but \u201ctitled\u201d, if you will. If you\u2019re not sure, check out the National Society if Leadership and Success. They get some cool presentations and resources.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t just attend career fairs, work them. Escort guests to their tables, help them set up, offer to fetch an extra pen if they need it, be friendly, that sort of thing. Don\u2019t stand by the door waiting for instructions, take help initiatives. When you walk through later to hand out your resumes, they\u2019ll remember you. \n\nIf you\u2019ve got professors who attend/present at conferences in your degree, get in good with them. I presented at a couple conferences at the side of one of my professors and ran into an attendee last year\u2026she remembered me, saying how I was so professional and on point and how impressed she was that I never looked at the slides (I also didn\u2019t say them word for word). Bumping into this lady and having her remember me presenting at a conference pre-COVID got me my first big job in my field. \n\nGood luck!!! And don\u2019t forget to take time to de stress, breathe, and have fun!!!",

You have your whole life ahead of you and you are more than a resume. remember, you gain knowledge by experience so don't shy away from opportunities you may enjoy! Looking in your hometown is a great idea, and if there are unpaid internships, you can apply for a scholarship/grant from IU and other organizations so you can still make money over the summer.",

The town is probably the size of the campus here, so everyone knows everyone. It's a very connected community, so while I would still have to fill out the application and do well in interviews, it would be fairly easy to reach out to businesses there instead of somewhere like Bloomington. Plus, I guessed she just assumed that one of my parents would be in business.",

Not a Kelly student but a political science/international studies/german studies student here.\n\nI am currently a senior at IU and I have completed 3 internships throughout my time at IU. One during the summer going into my junior year, one during a \"study abroad\" semester in Washington D.C, and another following that summer. I honestly have more than enough to put on my resume. I often need to cut out one of my internships/experiences when applying for jobs now.\n\nIt's fantastic that you're thinking about internships now. I think that speaks volumes about how successful you will be in your academic and professional career. I recommend 2-3 internships. Your first internship could be a development program/experience, like a study abroad. Overall though, I would say take your time, engage actively on campus and focus on applying for development programs during your sophomore year. After that development program, I would focus on applying to internships in the field that interests you most.\n\nI know a lot of people study abroad during their Sophomore/Junior year. I am not too familiar with Kelly's study abroad programs, though I am sure there is some sort of study abroad program that could place you into an internship. I highly recommend studying abroad. \n\nFor now though, I would say enjoy your summer. It may be the last real summer where you won't be busy with an internship/study abroad program. Good luck. You'll be alright though.",

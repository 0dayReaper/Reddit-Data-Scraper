    "postText": "nerves have been getting the better of me. applied on the 30th but forgot the transcript so my app ended up getting completed after the deadline; decision\u2019s gonna be march at the latest and im biting my nails. last SAT was an 1170 which im told IU is happy with, but looks like my GPA rn is about a 3.0 ive declared cybersec/global policy as a major and for ECs, ive done two years of BPA and made it to nationals; even got a computer security certification from certiport. to make matters worse covid\u2019s thrown me off semester and i dont have a credit of precalc, trig or calc but im currently doing college algebra at ivy tech right now. any input? my prediction is that im probably gonna get deferred but i really dont know and its got me messed up. thanks",

I\u2019d definitely look at befriending people in your major or clubs. For example, if you are premed and a POC, I\u2019d look into joining MAPS. Clubs like those introduce you to people who might share similar interests. Goes the same for cultural or religious clubs.",

I\u2019m in my 6th year of college (grad school) and my friend groups have changed significantly every year. In college, people are constantly changing / getting involved in new things. I developed many great relationships that weren\u2019t really all that deep. However, I definitely made a decent number of good deep friendships over the years too that stemmed from those prior. \n\nMy point is, college often has a lot of what I\u2019d call temporary friendships. It\u2019s not necessarily because you did something wrong, but just that people change and move onto new things. Eventually, some of these friendships could develop into deeper friendships.\n\nYou\u2019re still a freshman, and I\u2019d definitely take advantage of getting involved in dorm events and organizations on campus. If your RA throws an event, go to it! If someone is playing a board game in your building, feel free to ask if you can play. Small interactions like this helped me make friends in the dorms. And the biggest thing to remember, is every college student is in a similar boat. We are at that age where it\u2019s really not all that weird to strike up a conversation with people on campus who are in the exact same situation.\n\nNext year, I\u2019d definitely suggest strongly looking into getting involved in a few organizations on campus. IU has a ton of students with many niche organizations. I guarantee there\u2019s a few for you!",

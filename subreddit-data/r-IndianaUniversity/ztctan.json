Info science is about how information is organized and how people interact with information and technology. It\u2019s a broad degree but you can really go in a lot of directions with an MIS. I have one and I\u2019ve been an associate director of IT/application services lead for an administrative unit at IU for 9 years. I have classmates from the program who are librarians, front end web developers, UX designers\u2026 one is leading a division of enterprise systems at IU.\n\nI did the MIS/MLS dual degree, but the MIS was probably all I would need for my work. I\u2019m finishing up my PhD in Info Science now, feel free to DM me if you have questions. I\u2019m sure the program has changed since I graduated, OP, but I can answer questions, and I\u2019m sure the faculty would be happy to introduce you to current students.\n\nI don\u2019t know too much about the informatics master\u2019s but I did get to know a whole cohort of HCId masters students back in the day.",

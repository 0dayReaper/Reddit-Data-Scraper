    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am currently in the process of filling out my housing application. I am really keen on wanting to live in the JLLC as a freshman. My roommate is not a DA to Kelley, but is doing business and applied to the JLLC. \n\nIf he doesn't get into the JLLC, will I still be guaranteed that spot if I am admitted? I will put the LLC as #1 on my housing app, then roommate as #2. \n\nThanks.",

If you want a more immediate answer, you can email them your question now. I bet they\u2019d be happy to help.",

McNutt has the JLLC, Collins has the Collins LLC, Teter has the Luddy LLC, etc. So if you pick an LLC, you should try to find out the dorm it\u2019s in, since you will be required to live there.\n\nBut you don\u2019t need to be in an LLC to get a dorm. If you\u2019re just deadset on northwest, I believe you can just put northwest neighborhood on your housing application preferences (Correct me if I\u2019m wrong. It\u2019s been a year since I filled one out). From there you\u2019ll get a dorm up there (if they have a spot that\u2019ll let them accommodate your preferences).\n\nSo in summary if you want McNutt and you want to be in the LLC, try for the JLLC. But if you just want to be in McNutt or Foster (I assume you mean Foster, since Forest is southeast) and the JLLC doesn\u2019t seem like your cup of tea, apply for northwest neighborhood and hope for the best.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions and I\u2019ll answer best I can!",

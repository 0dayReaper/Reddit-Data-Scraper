    "postText": "I\u2019ve noticed a lot of people looking for apartments and wanted to give a review of Park Doral since I\u2019ve seen them mentioned a couple times here and on the Bloomington subreddit. This is a long post as I\u2019d like to give a view of the apartment that might be helpful before someone potentially rents here. [Insert obligatory apology for cellphone formatting weirdness]\n\nTL;DR: After living here for 2 years I\u2019d give them a 3/5. We paid $786 for a 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment and it was worth it at that price, but we missed the renew window due to waiting for job news and the rent was going to go up above $900 which is a lot for what you\u2019re getting. They do have graduate and preferred employer discounts but they don\u2019t take a lot off rent. The office is a bit bad at communication and can be rude and maintenance takes a while to get things done. If you live here it will be fine, but it\u2019s not great and you could do better easily. \n\n\nThe Good:\n\nLocation: \n\n-Park Doral is in a nice location. You\u2019re really close to campus and you\u2019re really close to the mall/target area without being too affected by the traffic of those areas. \n\n-There are bus lines within minor walking distance so if you need to take the bus you don\u2019t have to worry about getting to one of the stops. \n\nParking: \n\n-Parking is included, and there is usually plenty of it with a good amount of guest parking. \n\nMaintenance: \n\n-the maintenance guys for the building are all really friendly and I\u2019ve only had good experiences working with them. They respond to things as quickly as they can and when they\u2019re in your apartment they\u2019re super respectful and nice. \n\nThe office: \n\n-We haven\u2019t had issues with them cashing rent checks and they check up on maintenance requests fairly frequently \n\nUtilities: \n\n-we only pay for gas and electric and have managed to keep those costs quite low while keeping the apartment at a comfortable temperature.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nParking: \n\n-so while there is a good deal of parking a lot of people have their guests in resident spaces. I know that the office says they tow, but I haven\u2019t really seen that be a thing or seen parking really enforced. \n\nMaintenance: \n\n-like many other places in Bloomington maintenance is understaffed and therefore they\u2019re quite slow. \n\n-They partner with other properties for on-call issues and sometimes the people they send to respond to issues are really dismissive of concerns. An example of this was our bathroom was leaking through the ceiling (from our upstairs neighbors), we called the after hours maintenance and the guy they sent said that it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal and since the walls are made of concrete there can\u2019t be any water damage in the bathroom anyway. Lo and behold we ended up with water damage that needed to be fixed (and was fixed terribly). \n\nThe office: \n\n-the communication between the office and tenants can be vague. They send out really large pointed emails to the residents of a whole building rather than just the tenant in question so half the time we get an email we don\u2019t know if the issue is aimed at *us* or at someone else. \n\n-There have been a couple times when we\u2019ve gotten less than a 24 hour notice for inspections or the office coming in, which to me is a very big deal. \n-The regional manager who comes in for move-out inspections and other such things is horrifically *rude*.  We had some clothes on the couch (we were folding laundry when she came in) and she mentioned that we should pick the clothes up because it makes the apartment look messy. Another time she came in when our dishwasher *was broken* noted that there were dishes in the sink and told us we really needed to clean that up it\u2019s not a great way to live. I cannot understate how annoying and rude this woman is. \n\n-more than once the office has come into our apartment in error when they meant to go into a neighboring apartment. Which is a wonderful thing to have happen when you don\u2019t have clothes on because you were getting ready to go to work. \n\n-The office also does tours of your apartment if you don\u2019t renew your lease. Not a huge deal, but we had the office ask us if we\u2019d be willing to rearrange the furniture in one of our rooms (move bookshelves and such) so that potential residents got a better idea of what the second room would look like as a bedroom rather than an office. When we said no, the office worker was very visibly upset with us. \n-recently there hasn\u2019t been someone in the office during the posted hours so it can be challenging to get ahold of someone in a timely manner. \n\nThe apartment: \n\n-the carpet and appliances were quite old. We had issues with our fridge and stove that took *forever* to get fixed and there were a good number of times we had to fix things ourselves. \n\n-our upstairs neighbor is loud as *fuck*. While I understand that in a shared living setting there is bound to be noise; the amount we can hear is excessive. The walls are a bit thin, but they genuinely keep us up at night sometimes. \n\nUtilities:\n\n-the internet is okay. It goes out more then infrequently but less than frequently and it can be a little bit slow.",

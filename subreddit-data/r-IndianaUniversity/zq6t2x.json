    "postText": "Okay so like, if I can\u2019t pay the entirety of my bursar bill what do I do? Am I just stuck with the fact that it will always increase every month if I can\u2019t pay the full amount? I\u2019m so stressed about it. They have a \u201cpayment plan\u201d which I thought would be something I could pay throughout the year in small chunks but it\u2019s not small at all. Like I can barely pay THOSE amounts. I\u2019m not really financially smart when it comes to loans and stuff so I\u2019m just scared it\u2019s going to put me in a tough position considering I\u2019ve only done one semester here.",

I had to do that my very last semester at IU and they let me pick my monthly payment and timeline, however I did back it up with my income. I\u2019m paying zero interest for it too. They\u2019re much more willing to help you than you\u2019d expect. Call student central or put in a request online and they\u2019ll help you.",

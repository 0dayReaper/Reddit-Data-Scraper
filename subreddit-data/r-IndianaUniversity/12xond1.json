I was wondering if there are any suggestions for a minor that could help my admission to law school in the future? I\u2019ve heard a lot of history or communication / public advocacy, so if either of those are good choices please let me know. Thanks!",

It may seem less applicable or pertinent than a traditional law minor but it could definitely spark a conversation in an interview or something. Ethics/philosophy of law also sort of stands in its own realm of philosophy too, so if you don\u2019t feel that \u2018the study of god, existence, or consciousness\u2019 (or other stereotypical questions of philosophy) really interest you I\u2019m sure you could find classes relevant to your interest in political science.",

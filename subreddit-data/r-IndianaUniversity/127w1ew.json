    "postText": "Did anybody graduate from Indiana University  **O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs?**    \nIs the Master of Environmental Sustainability (MES) program at Indiana Uni worth it?  \nI cannot choose between University of Michigan SEAS and Indiana University. The biggest challenge for me is the tuition. UMICh is my dream school, but the tuition is overwhelming, as I couldn't get a scholarship/funding to study there. Although I got a scholarship from Indiana University, I'm thinking maybe UMICh is worth the price or does the ranking of the college don't play a role when finding a job?  \n\n\nWould be grateful if sb could share their thoughts and experience",

Not sure Umich is worth the price but I\u2019m OOS for both so their both pretty damn expensive but Umich is insanely expensive. \n\nAnyway I don\u2019t think prestige of a school matters much for grad school outside of medicine/law. I think you should look at the individual program that would offer you better opportunity\u2019s/cheaper/fits you personally. (But what do I know I\u2019m only a freshman in college so take all that with a grain of salt)",

I don\u2019t know anything about either schools masters programs but unless there is a definite advantage to going with Michigans program (like research opportunities that would be unattainable at IU, etc.) I think you should just go with the cheaper option.",

They will place you into the EPA, if that's what you want. \n\nAlso im personally biased against everything Michigan (Football/Basketball grudges).\n\nMES is a year intensive program, is Michigan also a year intensive program?",

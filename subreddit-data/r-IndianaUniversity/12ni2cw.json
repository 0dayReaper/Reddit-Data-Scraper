    "postText": "Hey, so I am hoping that someone who isn't an incoming freshman could help me. So I filled out my housing application on 3/14 and my roommate did hers on 4/15. We both are willing to pay the enhanced fee, but we did pick the neighborhood over each other. Is there still good odds of us getting both considering that it has been 1.5 months from the opening application date since I filled out mine and 2.5 months from the opening application date since she filled out hers?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anyone here filled their housing application out later (before May 1st) and gotten both preferences is what I guess I'm really trying to ask?",

Even if you don\u2019t, there have been times where RPS has been able to reassign you to another room with your preferred roommate. During my first year, my roommate had requested her best friend as her roommate, but they were assigned different rooms in the same quad (i lived on the honors floor at briscoe, so that\u2019s probably why). Anyway, RPS were able to assign them to a room at McNutt so they could be roommates, so they can make accommodations if they have the room to.",

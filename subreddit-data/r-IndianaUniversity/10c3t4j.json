The bus line is very close, and it\u2019s convenient and easy to get to campus. The rent is okay, and I\u2019ve had no issues with the apartment itself since settling in. The only bad thing about the apartment was that the kitchen was really gross when we first moved in, and there was hair everywhere in the bedrooms. But nothing that a very deep clean wouldn\u2019t fix. The building I\u2019m in is quiet, but I know a few people in other buildings that had problems with loud neighbors/dogs. I\u2019ve not had any problems leaving my car here so far, and have felt safe leaving it here. The amenities are okay but standard. Management is fine, but it took them a few months to replace my electronic lock that kept dying. Overall I would say they are decent apartments. They aren\u2019t shiny and brand new, but not falling apart and in better condition than some apartments I previously toured. If you\u2019re looking at other common student apartments, I\u2019ve heard equally good and bad things about all of them.",

            "comment": "I heard a mixed bag when I went to IU. The general consensus was it was overpriced for what you get but if price isn\u2019t something you are uber conscious about then its a good place. \n\nThe apartments are quite worn for the price and oftentimes have issues with being dirty on move in, and dinging you for every dust bunny on move out (which is honestly a college renting experience norm). The walk to the bus stop is often times long for people in the cold especially when they see people at the Monroe essentially just walk on. \n\nHowever, its back from the road so it can be a bit quieter and being near shopping with a bus line is nice. People like the staff generally and the units (once cleaned) can be pretty nice. \n\nThats all I remember lmao.",

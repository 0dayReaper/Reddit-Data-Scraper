The school is good and it\u2019s worth while, but if it\u2019s really going to put a dent in your loans and credit score then maybe reconsider\u2026I hate to come off as snobbish, but I\u2019m just saying from my perspective, I wouldn\u2019t come from out of state if I were paying my own bills. That said, I do love the education and campus, and I\u2019m certainly getting the most out of my time here. If that\u2019s something you can do, then maybe the trade off is worth while.",

    "postText": "My Mom is graduating with a Masters from IU. I live out of state and I am not super familiar with the school. Anyway, I am getting her a custom note pad and pen. I am thinking of putting this logo on the front of the note pad with a personalized message on the inside. Does this logo actually get used and would it be recognizable to an alumni? Would a IU grad want this used instead of the tradition pitchfork IU?\nThanks!",

Scholarships from the general application (as I understand it) are awarded mid-february, but programs from the SSA give notifications of acceptance separately.  I sent in my SSA jan 30, and got accepted into a program feb 8.  Since the SSA was due feb 1, you might be waiting until the end of the month, or maybe early march.",

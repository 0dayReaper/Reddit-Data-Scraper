We\u2019re both clueless, and don\u2019t really know where to start looking and how to decipher whether the listings are a good deal or not. We\u2019ve looked through some websites but I guess don\u2019t really understand them lol. Plus it seems like we\u2019re starting late. Any help would be appreciated, thanks",

            "comment": "Gonna be really hard to find a good place close to campus this late. I\u2019d look into the Dillon apartments or the Quarters (I currently live at the Dillon). Both are right next to each other and have shuttle services that take you to campus and back to the apartments (the Dillon ones suck and it seems like the Quarters are more on top with their bus schedules). My roommates and I applied around this time last year, I even think a little later, and still got a place at the Dillon with no real hassle. Just go on their websites and it\u2019s pretty straight forward from there - you\u2019ll schedule a visit with the complex\u2019s and then make a decision based on their availabilities.",

Only issues I\u2019ve noticed is the busses running behind on schedule and it being too packed, but other than that everything has been good. Nice gym, apartments are furnished, and maintenance is good about keeping up with work orders. \n\nWith all that being said, it\u2019s a little pricey and it\u2019s gonna be $959 (not including small fees) per person. I live in a 4 bedroom and my rent is around $750 a month.",

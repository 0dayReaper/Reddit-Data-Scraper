You can still make friends in a single, it just allows you to have your own personal space and the ability to stay up as long as you want with disrupting someone",

People can tell you all they want about how you can \u201cmake friends with your roommate\u201d and how \u201cconflict with them builds character\u201d or whatever, but you have plenty of opportunities to make friends (and encounter conflict). Like I said, live in a single dorm if you can. The potential risk of months of hell far outweighs the potential benefit of one friend",

And that having a roommate, even if you do get along, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019ll make friends with or through them, even if they aren\u2019t unlikeable.\n\nOP is better off taking the single then searching for other ways to be social: clubs, chatting with neighbors, attending events, talking to people in classes, etc. - the same ways they\u2019d meet people even if they did have a roommate. They\u2019d get a private space where they have all the same social opportunities.\n\nSo I\u2019m glad you had a good experience, but mine has been ass and I don\u2019t want OP being all hopeful about their roommate like I was just to end up in a regrettable, avoidable situation with someone they don\u2019t mesh with at all. Virtually everyone I\u2019m acquainted with either doesn\u2019t like their roommate either, barely interacts with them like me, or doesn\u2019t have one but still has a social life.",

Going to college should be uncomfortable to an extent, you get exposed to new situations, different types of people, etc. A roommate freshman year is a key part of that exposure, even if it\u2019s not the best match. If it really is that toxic there are plenty of approaches to dealing with it. Saying the risks far outweigh the rewards is pretty misleading and solely based on anecdotal experiences.",

The fact of the matter  - which I mentioned - is that having a roommate *can* be very beneficial, *or* could end up being a drag. My subjective interpretation of that based on *my own* experiences is that the potential benefits don't outweigh the potential downsides.\n\nI don't like my roommate, as our personalities and habits don't mesh. I don't like living in a small room with a roommate, as I like space and privacy. Sharing a dorm with my roommate has not benefited me in anyway, so I dislike the idea of having a \"dorm mate\" entirely. Based on those experiences, I don't think having a roommate is that great nor do I think the benefits outweigh the risks/negatives. Maybe it'll be different next year when I have a more spacious apartment with someone I know and like, and when I have a private room of my own. But with the conditions I've lived in, the idea of sharing a dorm doesn't appeal to me for various reasons.\n\nI agree college should be uncomfortable. It's a new setting for people, it's bound to be. But imo double rooms aren't worth it and can end up being uncomfortable with little to no benefit. There are plenty other ways to encounter conflict and meet people without a roommate. That's all I'm really suggesting.\n\nLike I said, I'm glad you had a good experience. But saying I'm \"misleading\" OP just because my experiences and views are different is disingenuous. OP is asking for different viewpoints on their situation, so I'm just offering mine, based on what I'd do in their shoes with the information I know now. Your views and experiences are just as true and right as mine, and OP should consider both of our stances.",

Fwiw, it looks like your main issues with this roommate are things like they eat loudly and do homework at night. These are things that can and should be a discussion with a roommate, it\u2019s about learning to communicate and settle differences with others. That\u2019s by no means a roommate from hell, it\u2019s a relatively normal 18 year old who is learning to get along with new people as well.",

My issue is that you called me misleading when I never said anything objectively untrue. I started off acknowledging that there are benefits and downsides, then used my personal experiences to weigh them. That\u2019s all. OP can take that info as they wish.\n\nIf you want to use statistics, *you can do that*, but I don\u2019t have to. Just like nobody else in this thread did or has to. Please don\u2019t try and tell me what the more \u201cuseful\u201d way for me to express my opinion is.

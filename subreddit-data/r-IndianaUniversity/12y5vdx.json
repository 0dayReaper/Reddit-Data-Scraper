Editors and management are chill and communication is key. You make $20/story. For sports, it can be a bit of a grind at times, but if you enjoy writing it\u2019s a great place to be. My only gripe is sometimes they\u2019re very strict about word choice and content but as a freshman you can\u2019t really ask for a better place to start.",

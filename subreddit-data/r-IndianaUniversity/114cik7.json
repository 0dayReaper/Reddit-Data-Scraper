    "postText": "I\u2019m not sure if I should post this here, but I can\u2019t think of anywhere else.\n\nWhile out at night I noticed a red car moving suspiciously next to my residence hall, Teter. At first I thought i was overthinking things or the driver was just weird. They started to slow down near me, but again, I just brushed it off.\n\nWhile walking down the sidewalk as I was about to cross the road a car was driving by. I waited for them to pass, but then they slowed down. I thought they were trying to let me go first, but as I started to walk across the street I realized it was the same red car.\n\nI hurried to the store I was heading to, bought what I needed and left. Didn\u2019t see the car, till I realized it was in the same place. I went a different route back so I wouldn\u2019t pass them. I turned my head back as I was walking, and saw what I think was that same red car pull up, then do a complete u-turn back towards where I originally came from.\n\nTook the long way back, looked to my right, and saw what looked to be a red car pull out from behind a building turning towards my direction. Got to my dorm quickly though.\n\nNow it was pretty dark which is why I\u2019m sort of unsure if some of the cars I saw were the red one, and I didn\u2019t think to take a picture of car when it came up close. Is it worth notifying the police about this? If so what exactly should I do? I don\u2019t want to screw up.\n\nEdit: I've already tried to look for a place to report, but all the IU/Bloomington anonymous reporting services I found either weren't working or need a crime to have taken place, and technically what happened wasn't a crime. Still I'm uncomfortable with not doing anything in case the driver really was planning on doing something, and if they might try with someone else.",

I looked outside and a red car was ZOOMING out of the parking lot and I didn\u2019t see the girls anywhere. I freaked myself out about it and almost called the cops but didn\u2019t know if I had heard it right. I woke up and told my roommate this and she mentioned she saw this today. I thought I should say something. Did the car have any defining markers?",

Apparently about 2-300 is all that's needed to blind someone mid-day. If you use something as powerful as that light in the dark, aren't you risking blinding yourself too from the light reflecting off surfaces, especially if its in an enclosed space?",

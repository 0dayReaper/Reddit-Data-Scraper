            "comment": "I took C291 around the COVID period (not a summer semester). I don't know how much the class has changed, but the version that I took was initially designed by Adeel Bhutta and was far more work than was necessary. He eventually pulled back on some of the assignments, and it became more manageable. I enjoyed the final project quite a bit.\n\nI went in with an Associates from IvyTech and everything was taught in C++ there, so in some sense, I had a head start. A lot of your headaches are likely going to revolve around C strings and pointers. I did all of my work on the Linux VM that they allow you to remote to so I didn't have to deal too much with whether or not my code would compile for the instructors. \n\nIf they are running an autograder now for that course, be sure to unit test your own stuff before submitting especially if they have a low cap on your submissions.\n\nEDIT: Also, for general programming tips, you should probably state what your experience is with programming in general so far.",

            "comment": "If you have literally any prior experience you're fine, which judging by the fact that you skipped C211 and C200 you definitely do.If you're really concerned I'd learn about pointers or how memory works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Oh I just realized you are taking it over the summer right now, sorry about that.  \nFirstly, I have no idea on what you're doing right now so I can't really give best practices, however the [c plus plus docs](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/malloc/?kw=malloc) are really helpful when trying to learn how stuff works (remember, all valid C code is valid C++ code). If you're struggling on the coding aspect though, you honestly can only practice. Find some projects outside of class that sound fun, and code them, and maybe put them on your Resume if they're good enough. I know that sounds really stupid, and hell if you're doing summer classes then you're probably too busy to do this, but the only way to get better at coding is to code, unless I'm missing something. On this note though, you don't have to necessarily code in C to get better, I'd recommend languages that have C based syntax (Java, JS, C#) or even Python (as it's also procedurally based) to get better. I don't know if this is useful, but I hope it helps.",

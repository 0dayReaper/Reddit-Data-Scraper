    "postText": "As part of my course project, I am conducting a survey to better understand the differences between individuals who have become radicalized and those who have not, in terms of their exposure to extremist language and content, engagement with such content, and participation in social networks.\nYour input would be invaluable in helping me gather data for this important study. The survey takes about 10-15 minutes to complete and is completely anonymous.\n\nhttps://forms.gle/xo888AcG5Tvgr3gx8",

What about land back? CRT? Defend the police? Anti-trans rhetoric? Pro- or anti- abortion movements?\n\nWithout knowing how you define extremism everyone is going to be inclined to say they don\u2019t encounter much of it.",

    "postText": "Graduate workers at IU are voting this Sunday to authorize a strike \u2014 no teaching, no grading, no office hours \u2014 because the IU administration has refused to open dialogue with the majority of grad workers who want a union in order to end mandatory fees, bargain for a living wage, and get better healthcare benefits. \n\nIt is VERY likely the vote will go through (but I\u2019ll post here to confirm).\n\nSo far, over 900 graduate workers have pledged to go on strike.\n\nProvost Shrivastav has tried to leverage undergrad well-being against the Graduate Workers Coalition\u2019s unionizing efforts, but let\u2019s show him that the quality of undergraduate education is dependent on graduate workers having a say in their working conditions!\n\n\nAt noon on Wednesday the 13th, first day of the strike, there will be an UNDERGRAD STUDENT WALK-OUT! \n\nMany undergrads will be leaving their classes to go to the courtyard between Ballantine Hall and the Biology building, and march to the picket line. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have class at that time, join your peers in the courtyard!\n\nThere are other ways to show solidarity, too:\n\nJoin Coalition members on Monday 10am at Sample Gates to distribute  flyers for the strike and walk-out. \n\nCome to Canterbury House on Tuesday at 7pm to help make buttons and signs for the strike.\n\nSign the undergrad petition: \n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/iub-undergraduate-students-for-graduate-workers-union?changeinvitetoteam=true\n\nShare, or donate to, the strike fund: \n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/igwcue-strike-fund-spring-2022\n\nSee you at the picket line!",

To argue that the e school doesn\u2019t have the money is complete nonsense. Cheaper, smaller and worse schools pay staff and grad students much better then IU.",

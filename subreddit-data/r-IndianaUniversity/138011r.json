Am looking for recommendations, housing, info about IU, etc. Everything i\u2019m seeing looks like it\u2019s geared towards freshman / new students. Anyone know about anything for grad students??",

Often times they are either at bars with food offered or the availability for group drinks after a rally. Also allows you to connect with graduate student in separate areas that depending on your research could prove to be invaluable. \n\nYou can see posting about upcoming activities on their Instagram: https://instagram.com/indianagrads?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=",

Course is taught literally word-for-word out of the e-text so while it may seem like you can just do it on your own, seeing what they\u2019re talking about live in front of you makes it make so much more sense. Set aside enough time to do your GPs and don\u2019t wait until the night they\u2019re due to start them (like way too many people I know did this year). \n\nLecture kinda sucks but if you\u2019re struggling in lab they\u2019re basically free points so take advantage of that too.",

The reviews, you just do after. Easy as that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople like to mistakenly say, \"oh you need a windows laptop for Kelley\". But when you take the course, you will see how it doesn't matter what laptop you bring.\n\nWhether you have a mac or windows, you will be able to do it easily from your laptop. (Yes, you can do it easily on mac as well... many people are unaware of that).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut that being said, there are numerous advantages to doing your work on the IU computers:\n\n\\- Easy to access... there will be a computer lab in your dorm, and you can easily go to wells library and work on the graded projects as you wish (many people choose to do this). If you get hungry or need a pick me up, there are some \"restaurants\" in the basement eatery and a coffee shop as well).\n\n\\- Familiarity... every computer across IU that you will use for k201, is the same. That means the ones you practice on for your weekly assignments will be the same as the one you take your two exams on. If you choose to do it on your laptop, that's fine. But the layout will be slightly different.\n\n\\- One IU synching. When you do the assignments on the IU computers, you can easily sync your files. So the work you do in the discoveries before class will be ready to be built upon in class.\n\nAs you can see, there are many reasons to do it on the IU computers, rather than your laptop. But the most important is definitely simulating the exam environment, since that is where K201 trips most students\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**K201 is a simple course as long as you do the work. I finished with an A this past spring. Go to every class, do every discovery, and get tutoring on the GPs and I guarantee you will finish with at least a B+.**",

Whether you use your dorms, or the library, there is an overwhelming amount of computers. I will say, in the busiest of times, Wells library can get filled up on the first floor of computers, but that is why you have numerous floors filled to the brim with computers to utilize as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, if your parents/you can afford it, go with the highest quality laptop you can get.

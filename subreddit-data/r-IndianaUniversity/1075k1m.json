The little building on the corner near the school of public health was a part of the stadium, as was the 10th and Fee Lan building you walk through to enter the arboretum. It was going to be turned into a parking lot but that changed as a result of one of IU's classes (I don't remember which, I think it was 1948? It's the one the gazebo is dedicated to) raised funds to transform it into the green space it is today.",

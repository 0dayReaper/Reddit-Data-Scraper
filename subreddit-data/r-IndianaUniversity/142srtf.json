    "postText": "Hello! I'm an incoming student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I'm curious about the reputation and outcomes of the CS program at IU. Can anyone provide insights into the program's caliber and the success of its graduates in securing job opportunities? I'm also interested in learning about the quality of professors within the program. Given that IU offers a liberal arts degree, I was wondering if the smaller class sizes foster a more personalized learning experience. Lastly, I'd like to know if the program enjoys a positive reputation among companies and is well-regarded in the industry.",

            "comment": "lol iu cs is what you make of it. i\u2019m a sophomore and have seen some of my peers do some really amazing things and get good internships early on. \n\nidk who told you class sizes are small, they are most definitely not. my three cs classes were in large lecture halls. however the labs and discussion sections are much smaller and give you an opportunity to ask questions and get personalized instruction.\n\ni\u2019m terms of recruiting/career outcomes look at some companies you\u2019re interested in on linkedin and see how many grads from iu work at that company.\n\nand i\u2019d say that although the ranking is a bit lower than, say purdue, you still learn essentially the same things as you would anywhere else (while still maintaining access to shitloads of fun)\n\nif you end up doing cs at iu i would recommend starting in c211 over c200. it is significantly harder but will prepare you for c212 and other classes. also, the course material is online on a website you can find without too much digging, so you can get a head start. (if you can\u2019t find it dm me)\n\nonce again if you do end up going to IU, i would recommend applying for the shoebox (before you\u2019re even at school, i\u2019ve been on a waiting list for 4 months). and also look into some finance stuff if you\u2019re interested (ie. ecmg and other funds), reach out to professors to do undergrad research, and join email lists for luddy news.\n\nand if your idea of fun isn\u2019t dungeon and dragons, and playing videos games 24/7, don\u2019t join the luddy llc no matter how many emails you get. it added very very little value to my resume and network. However, it can be helpful for socially awkward students to make friends and get out of there comfort zones.",

Where can I find the link to sign up for it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like you're mixing in some business classes with your CS studies. Any particular perks or advantages to doing that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince you've already got a year of IU under your belt, how do you manage to juggle schoolwork with the party scene there? Is it doable?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, would you say CS at IU is easier than at other more STEM like schools or not really?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: I forgot to mention that I was interested in the BA over the BS. I won't get to specialize in something but do you think I should consider the BS some more? I heard it doesn't really matter but would appreciate your take? \n\nIt sounds like your in greek life? Are you able to balance school and your social life pretty well?",

As for the two intro classes c200 is an easy A, C211 can be difficult at times but will prepare you for future classes.\nas for the quality of instruction, if i\u2019m being completely honest i\u2019ve had trouble understanding some profs but they usually supplement with good reading material and thought provoking homework assignments.\n\nas with any difficult major, unless your time management skills are insanely good, there will be weekends where you have to stay in to work. it sucks but most peoples motivation to do cs is for the pay and cushy jobs, you will have to work for it in most cases. rush is strangely competitive especially at top houses. i would recommend trying to meet as many guys in houses as you can before rush and trying to figure out which is right for you. it\u2019s super competitive and i believe only roughly 1/3 of people signed up for rush end up receiving a bid so connections are key. having a deep or exciting conservation with one brother is better than small talk with all of the brothers\n\ni\u2019m taking business classes to have a better understanding of modern finance (and the jobs at the cross-section of comp sci and finance pay more than any other job out of school)\n\non the ba vs bs, i honestly have no idea i think you take less math? i\u2019m not entirely sure but i do think the math helps in developing a way of thinking necessary in cs, but it can be challenging. personally i took my calc classes at community college, compared to my peers, i seemed to have a lot more free time\n\nlink to shoemaker: https://luddy.indiana.edu/marketing/shoemaker-innovation-center.html\ni believe you apply through email, some of the \u201cstartups\u201d in it are absolutely horrendous, so i wouldn\u2019t worry too much about the idea. from what i\u2019ve seen the connections, mentorships and funding opportunities you can make here are very high quality, but you can talk to the guy who runs it if you want better information",

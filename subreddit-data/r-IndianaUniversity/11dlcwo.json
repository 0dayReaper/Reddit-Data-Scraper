Also was wondering what the bathroom situation is in these neighborhoods/halls.",

Read would be best bathroom option because you have a toilet and sink shared between you and the person beside you (suite mate). And you share a shower room with you specific floor: they have some room option in the core of read that have their own personal bathrooms not shared with others maybe a suitemate.",

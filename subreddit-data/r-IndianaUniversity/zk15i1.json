    "postText": "I'm looking for a roommate for the 2023-2024 (Aug 2023-2024) school year. I already have a pre-lease signed for an unfurnished quad 2-bed with Scholar's Quad, meaning we're guaranteed a spot. My roommate bailed, so I'm looking for someone to take his place. Half of the deposit is already paid, the rest being paid when we sign the actual lease. The cost is about 1399-1429 which we'll split. Utilities are included in this price. In-unit washing and drying as well. Each person has a room and their own private bathroom. Planning on splitting cost for some common area furniture like dining table/couch and a better wifi plan.\n\nA little about me, I'm going to be a junior next year, cs major. I'm a clean person, the type who takes off their shoes inside, I'll need someone to take his spot and apply before the end of December. I'm would like to talk over Zoom so we can see each other in person and discuss any details if you're interested. Dm me if you're interested.",

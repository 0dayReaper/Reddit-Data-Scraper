You are GUARANTEED to get Direct Admit into Kelley as long as you get accepted into IU. Like is this true that you are GUARANTEED to get Direct Admit as long as you have those stats?",

IU Kelley is literally ranked on the same level for business as Cornell and that\u2019s so hard to get into even with a 4.7 people get rejected. It\u2019s crazy that Kelley, ranked at same level GUARANTEES  you in with a 3.8. At my school like everyone has GPA of 4.0+ and SAT 1400+",

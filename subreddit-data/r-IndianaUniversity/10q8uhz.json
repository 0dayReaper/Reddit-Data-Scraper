            "comment": "V. Conclusions\n\n1. The IUN administration\u2019s summary actions to suspend Professor McPhail from service, drastically reduce his salary, and, subsequently, dismiss him from his tenured appointment were effected in violation of AAUP-recommended standards of academic due process set out in the 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure and the Recommended Institutional Regulations on Academic Freedom and Tenure. \n\n2. Professor McPhail has alleged that the stated reasons for the actions taken against him were pretextual and that the real basis for these actions was retaliation for intramural speech that should have been protected under principles of academic freedom. In the absence of an appropriate proceeding, these highly credible claims remain unrebutted. \n\n3. The racial climate at IUN appears to be unwelcoming to faculty members of color. In Professor McPhail\u2019s case, it appeared to have been downright hostile, as evidenced by the presence of racist tropes of incompetent, angry, and physically violent Black men in the language used to justify his dismissal. \n\n4. Shared academic governance cannot thrive at an institution in which the administration disregards crucial institutional policies. Nor can it thrive at an institution in which the administration regularly and without compelling reasons rejects the recommendations of duly constituted faculty committees after they have conscientiously discharged their duties in areas of faculty primacy. Conditions for academic governance at Indiana University Northwest can therefore only be described as unsound.",

Wells and saying, \u2018Hey, they won\u2019t let us eat in town,\u2019 and Wells going into town and saying, \u2018Well, if they can\u2019t eat here, nobody can,\u2019 and that\u2019s the kind of courage. It\u2019s concrete commitment to diversity and action and not just words.\u201d",

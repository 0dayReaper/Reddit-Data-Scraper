The bill says \u201cadjusted personal computer\u201d and I have no idea what this means. Does anyone have any insight? I\u2019ve emailed them but no response yet.",

What I can tell you is that if the bursar doesn\u2019t respond to you or simply doesn\u2019t help you, try to speak to a trusted professor. Sometimes professors can help by making them email you back faster/stand up for you. Best of luck!",

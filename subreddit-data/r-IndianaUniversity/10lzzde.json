The entire IU business plan is predicated on low pay and bare bones minimal staffing. The governor\u2019s office put whitten in that seat to bring their right wing conservative agenda to higher education in this state and by god, she is going to do it.",

If you are serious about wanting to know the reason behind this move look no further than the pay and benefits increases given to SAA\u2019s last summer. COAS is pretty much broke so the money for PhD student increases comes first out of MS degree programs. Next change you\u2019ll see is fewer SAA positions as the size of many graduate programs shrink. Mainly those graduate programs that can\u2019t support themselves through external (grant) funding.\n\nEdit: so I guess indirectly you can blame the Provost since he agreed to the increases for SAA\u2019s. Then it gets dumped on the College to figure out how to pay for it.",

You can't shrink one without the other two atrophying.",

The DGS that wrote the letter referenced in the article demonstrated a tremendous lack of professional integrity. Resign as DGS if you disagree but do not throw your colleagues under the bus so that the graduate students will still like you and be your friend.",

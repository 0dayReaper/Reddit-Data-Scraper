Excel requirements of Kelley will make it inconvenient\u2026 and most of the business world is on windows anyway so best get familiar if you aren\u2019t already. \n\nIf you game or are thinking of getting into that realm, there are several competent gaming laptops with decent battery life that could be solid options. Wonderful weight to power ratios on those these days. I\u2019m an Alienware Stan, so I\u2019d recommend that even after acknowledging flaws and admittedly premium price. Something with a 3070/4070 and Optimus screen tech (for battery life) would knock almost all games, VR included, out of the park (I own a 2020 3070 model).\n\nIf you have no interest there and want a 4-year + machine, I\u2019d rec Dell latitude if you have the cash it won\u2019t have all the newfangled features of say, HP Spectre, but it\u2019s a very popular enterprise options for a good reason: build quality/longevity. Otherwise, most modern HP and Lenovo products kick ass and would serve you well.",

You need half a semester of access (windows only), and many semesters of excel (better on windows). A Mac is fine* but commenter is right in saying most accounting/finance businesses are already on windows. If you\u2019re a Mac Stan, you\u2019re probably fine with getting one because of all the resources IU offers. \n\nFine* assuming you have access to consistent, strong internet or consistent access to the physical hardware IU offers in libraries, classrooms, etc. \n\nI use a Mac because I also have a $$$ expensive beast windows desktop (yes I game) that I use for just about everything when I\u2019m NOT physically in class. \n\nIf you\u2019re not a big apple guy, just get a windows.",

Works great and you can use pretty much anything that can connect to the internet for that. \n\nTo run apps natively, as a finance/accounting major, you\u2019ll probably want a Windows computer to easily run Microsoft Access and Excel. Tho if you have a Mac, you can use cloud Apps or install Windows on the Mac too. UITS Support Center used to help with that, not sure if they still do.",

A Mac will work, but we're seeing more compatibility issues with them all the time. An average size hard drive will be fine because you'll have ample online storage. If you choose one of the new Dell or Surface Pro laptops that have only USB-C connections, be sure to get an adapter for C to A that you can stash in your bag. Otherwise, any regular laptop with good battery life that isn't too heavy will serve you well. Hope that helps!",

They mass produced a bunch of 1660ti and 2060rtx laptops a couple years ago with i7 intels, I see those on sale and used for like $500-$600.   Those would work, plus you can play most games in your spare time!  Honestly, you probably just need a fast processor, and might not even need that.",

For the last several months, The College has been reconsidering who can hold an SAA line, and how things like fee remissions and health insurance will be handled for those who perform labor for The College.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We were informed last week that beginning in Fall 2023, out of \"financial necessity,\" terminal MA students' compensation for their CA work will be \"cut\" by reclassifying them from SAAs with stipends, full fee remissions, and health care to hourly workers with partial fee remissions and no health care. This change is being made despite the disapproval of chairs, directors and DGS's from across The College who have expressed their deep concerns on how this change will affect the lives of their students and the health of their programs and departments.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Please know that this DGS registered her strongest opposition to this move from the beginning, on the record, including last week when the change was announced.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I regret being the bearer of such news. I am, however, here to discuss this with you in whatever format you may wish, whether collectively or as individuals.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sincerely, ACM\n\nTerminal Masters students: students enrolled in a MA program with the intention of completing their degree and not continuing on to pursue a Doctoral degree\n\nCA: course assistant",

Most SAA lines are for PhD students, not Master's students.\n\nI'm guessing the vast majority of graduate students, faculty, and of course the general populace doesn't understand how funding of students works at IU.  I know a bit because I've been around so long and my funding situation has changed multiple times, but even I don't know all of it.\n\nI don't have the numbers... so I can only speak from knowledge on the handful of departments that I'm familiar, but the vast majority of Master's students that are TAs are **not** SAA's.  My department is fairly small, but I think only 1 master student has an SAA line, and the rest are paid hourly (like 10 or so people).\n\nIronically, if the union actually believes \"paying some students hourly for the same wage creates artificial divisions\", then they should support what the university is doing.  They are making it more equitable as funding for all master's students will be the same instead of some getting additional benefits.",

Also, positions can vary by department but their are department positions and official positions recognized by the college.  \n\nSAA is a funding method that comes with the stipend, tuition remission, and healthcare.  Hourly... well it seems like hourlies get paid by the hour but some can also get tuition remission.  Not exactly sure how that works but this was my funding situation my first semester of my Masters.\n\nI believe TA is a position that some students/departments have (whether they're a SAA or an hourly) but I don't think the college recognizes this position.  This was like 10+ years ago, but my understanding was there were GA = grading assistant and AI = Associate Instructor.  In economics, for example, they have TAs, but in the system they were put in as AIs (which enabled them to get EM-P parking passes). **Note, I am less certain with what I'm saying in this paragraph as it was from awhile ago and may have been given incorrect information.**\n\nI would imagine most AIs (graduate students that typically teach) are SAAs, but I don't know if this is always true.",

Removing health insurance benefits literally puts the lives of MA students at risk, while reducing tuition remission will drastically increase in the precarity that students already face.\n&gt; \n&gt; We would ask that union representatives (Elijah Beaton, Jakob Myers, and Hugh Farrell) meet with you at your earliest convenience to discuss these changes further. Moreover, we want to make this meeting open to any other students as well.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/IndianaGrads/status/1617581661251858440",

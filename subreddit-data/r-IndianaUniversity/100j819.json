            "comment": " If your grades are reasonable I'm getting accepted IU isn't very difficult with a good application.  If you have very good grades and a very good application you can get direct admittance to your school.  If your grades are average you will most likely be accepted into the University Division.  For the most part in UD, you just worry about prerequisite classes and GenEd classes, in order to get your grades up and be able to be accepted into your desired specific school.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a sophomore Kelley student and I live off campus with 2 other Kelley students and one that\u2019s trying to get into Kelley. 3 of us were direct admits. The one that\u2019s trying to get into it (who transferred from a school in another state) is having some difficulty in a couple classes which is probably hurting his odds, last I heard. I met a couple people trying to get in last year also and I think it\u2019s rather difficult if you\u2019re not a direct admit anecdotally but statistically odds aren\u2019t bad as they take at least several hundred per year (you can look those up, I don\u2019t have them on the top of my head). I think like only 70% of Kelley is direct admits meaning a bunch did internal transfer. I\u2019ve also heard some Kelley kids got into Kelley via internal transfer with Cs before so I don\u2019t think anybody can really answer how difficult it is to do that besides the committee because they recently changed it (and seem to every year).\n\nIf your applying from high school, shoot your shot and see. If you\u2019re not sure if its worth it to apply because your afraid of getting rejected, it\u2019s worth it. We love it here. It\u2019s a great school. We don\u2019t have a workload that kills us like UMich, NYU, or Cornell AEM (schools I also considered) but still get the benefits of a top business degree and employers tend to hire us because of the soft skills and relationships we develop from actually socializing with each other. \n\nIf you\u2019re out of state and you or your parents are veterans you may even be able to get instate tuition based on recent additions to residency laws (contact CMVS, both I and my roommate get it) which makes it significantly cheaper than top 10 business schools too (by approximately $40-60k year).\n\nEdit: to be clear all of my roommates and I are from out of state\n\nAnd by soft skills I mean things like sales and persuasion that we pick up when we\u2019re trying to convince our friends to go out to Upstairs Pub with us the Friday before the weekend of the weekend before break (50% chance it\u2019s dead, 50% chance it\u2019s popping)\n\nOur workshops and clubs are also excellent. I\u2019m in a few clubs and we had people like Evan Kauffman of KKR come in and speak to us (mentioned how our workshops put us ahead of other schools like Harvard in investment banking with certain firms because we actually know how to build a discounted cash flow in excel) and I believe Sam Zell among many others spoke to real estate club last year. \n\nMark Cuban occasionally visits campus and hits up Kilroys while he\u2019s here so that\u2019s also always exciting (to grab a selfie with the owner of the Mav\u2019s)",

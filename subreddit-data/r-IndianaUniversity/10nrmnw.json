But if taken at Ivy Tech you have to get a C for it to be eligible to transfer and transfer credits don't count towards your IU GPA.\n\nEdit: the class is very midterms and finals heavy so there is really no way to try and shoot for a C because you either know the material or you don't. Try and be as accurate and precise as you can and hope you don't mess up too much.",

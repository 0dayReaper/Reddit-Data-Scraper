Maybe that's being covered elsewhere.\n\nEdit: or even just some links highlighting what the culture center is offering to the community right now.",

How did this lady manage to choose this girl, in particular?\n\n\n\"Citing court records, WRTV-TV reports that Davis told police she stabbed the woman multiple times in the head with a folding knife, because it \u201cwould be one less person to blow up our country.\u201d\"\n\n\nLike did this person just really not get out much? My money's on some deteriorating mental illness. This was just so senseless.",

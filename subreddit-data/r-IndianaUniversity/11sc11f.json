    "postText": "I was accepted into the MPA program and I'm wondering what life is like for grad students at IU and in Bloomington. \n\nHow was your experience in the MPA program? How do the different concentrations interact with one another? Do you feel like the cost to attend was worth it for your career? What postgrad positions and incomes are typical? To what regions of the country do alumni move? I'm from out-of-state and would like to work in Chicago or Minneapolis one day.\n\nAre there any places grad students typically live in the area? What bars have older crowds? \n\nIf you think there is anything else important please let me know!",

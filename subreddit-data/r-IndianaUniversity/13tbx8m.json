Assuming you\u2019re looking for a 1BR so you can live alone, the price for anything that\u2019s not sketchy will probably be $700-$1,000 per month minimum, and generally you pay way more than minimum to live very close to campus. Accepting taking a bus to commute, being willing to do a long walk commute, or getting a bike and commuting that way will save you a lot of rent money. \n\nI trust apartments.com for finding a place. I would not trust Craigslist. IU also has housing resources you can find online.",

Although its a bit late to get all the good ones, you will still find some. Try east side because bus frequencies are better and they are reachable distance to college mall and other small establishments.",

            "comment": "I am actually trying to find someone to take over my lease at reserve on third for the next academic year (July 29th 2023 through July 26th 2024). It is 570 per month + electric (internet and water is covered).\n\nThe lease is for one bedroom in a 3bed 3 bath unit. It has an attached private bathroom and walk in closet. So, you would get your own bedroom and bathroom, but would have 2 roommates.\n\nIt's not close to Luddy, but is right next to a bus stop for the 6 bus, which goes down 10th to Luddy. On this bus you can get to Luddy in about 15 minutes, and the bus runs really often. I used it to get to Luddy all last year, and never had any issues. \n\nI'm transferring to a different school, so looking for someone to take over the lease.",

            "comment": "I took MATH-S403 last semester. We used Artin. I think Artin is not such a great book but it gets the job done. If you\u2019re not familiar with proofs I would take the stepping stone course (don\u2019t remember the name or number; think it\u2019s 300 level) that introduces you to formal logic and proofs. Linear algebra is also required and definitely necessary. Definitely do not take MATH-M403 without taking linear algebra first. \n\nI\u2019m taking MATH-S415 now, which is different but related to MATH-M413. Not sure which textbook is used, but it requires very strong proof knowledge (the whole course is proofs) as well as strong foundations in calculus. I would recommend taking calculus 1-4 first. Linear algebra is useful, but I doubt it\u2019s required here. I don\u2019t think calculus 4 is required, but it isn\u2019t for MATH-S415 either and it has DEFINITELY been paramount in understanding the course, so I would still recommend it. \n\nIf you have any further questions feel free to ask",

I would definitely recommend practicing your proofs if you\u2019re looking to get ahead. Get those down solid, and you\u2019ll be perfectly fine. \n\nI would say I spent an average amount of time on the course. Who is the professor? That will determine how the course goes usually and I know a couple of them and can tell you what I know",

In terms of pre-reqs, a couple 300-levels is fine since it\u2019s not computation heavy, but I\u2019d highly recommend familiarizing yourself with proofs and logic. It was one of my more time-consuming math classes compared to other 400-levels",

    "postText": "I intended to take Calculus 1 online during the Summer, but when I tried to do so on the schedule builder, there was only one class and it told me all the seats were taken. I'm confused on how on all the seats can be taken if it's an online course. Are there no other ways I could take the course online this summer? Also, if there is, do I need to meet with my advisor to properly enroll and notify Ivy Tech that I've fulfilled the prerequisites?",

I just opted to send an email so they can clarify themselves what I need to do.\n\nWorst comes to worst, I'll take it online over the Fall and just take another Gen Ed course online this summer alongside the one I'm already taking.",

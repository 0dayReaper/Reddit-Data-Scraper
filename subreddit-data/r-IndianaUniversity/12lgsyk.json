    "postText": "How is the computer science program at IUB? I've heard that the AI/ML courses are good and have good faculty but the core engineering/systems like OS, networking, and Distributed Systems are not up to the standard. Is that really the case? I've also got an admit from the University of Utah MSCS. What would be a better option among the two? Also, does the big alumni network of IUB help in getting referrals and getting a job?",

(Replace \\`B544\\` with the appropriate course number.)\n\nYou can then use [https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) to determine how good the professors for your courses were in the past. (This is not a great metric, but it is something.)\n\nAlso visit [https://csrankings.org](https://csrankings.org) and have a look at IU's faculty and their research areas. The little home icon next to each professor links to their website, if they have one.",

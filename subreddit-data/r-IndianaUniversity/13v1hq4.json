I started looking into zip car and I wanted to see if anyone has had any experience with it. Mainly looking to see if it\u2019s actually practical and convenient in Bloomington. Thank you!",

If you're asking for the daily use, you don't really need a car if you live on campus, because there are buses around.\n\nMake sure to download the IU Mobile app, and turn your location on for this app, in the app specific settings, if you use an iphone (a lot of freshman do not know to do this)",

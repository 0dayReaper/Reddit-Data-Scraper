As long as it's not a floor wide communal it's good. Would like to dorm in a single but not required. Anything near Kelley around the 6-9k range? \n\n\nAny recs?",

Rooms are either private bath shared with a suitemate, or pod style where you share a bathroom with like 3 or 4 other rooms. It's super nice over there. They have singles wirh private bath but those usually go to upperclassmen",

It\u2019s down the street from Kelley and will also be closer to other buildings you\u2019ll likely have classes in than the northwest neighborhood. The bathrooms are pod style so you have a shower, sink, and toilet in each bathroom pod. These are shared amongst the floor but it\u2019s better than full communal style.",

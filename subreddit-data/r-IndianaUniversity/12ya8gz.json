    "postText": "I'm going to be retaking Orgo 1 as my progress in it this semester was way too rocky to move on to Orgo 2 (I dropped the class a few weeks ago), and I currently have the option to retake it this summer with Burlingham or next fall with Laura Brown.\n\nI've heard phenomenal things grade-wise about Brown, and absolutely heart-wrenching things about Burlingham. Is it worth waiting until the fall and taking it with Brown? Or should I just brave it through the summer? \n\nI heard from someone else taking a different class taught by Burlingham, that the class average on exams are absolutely *abysmal*, so now I'm scared...",

            "comment": "Laura Brown was a sweetheart when I had her for orgo 2. That  might have been because it was a zoom class so she might have been more lenient with us, but I think she is a great instructor in general.\n\nI also had Burlingham for biochem C483 (aka not orgo) and tbh for that class I liked him &amp; thought he did a fine job teaching. Can\u2019t speak to what his orgo classes are like, sorry.\n\nWill it delay your degree progress to wait until the fall to retake?  If not, I wouldn\u2019t spend the extra $$$ on summer classes if I were you. But no matter when you retake, at least try to learn from your mistakes and you should be able to do well no matter who the professor is. Good luck, you got this!",

            "comment": "I had Laura brown for orgo 1 and Burlingham for orgo 2. Here are a few pros and cons I can think of for both:\n\nLaura Brown Pros:\n- teaches slowly enough to where you can understand what she\u2019s teaching in lecture \n- curves exams and understands we have GPAs to worry about\n- very kind and understanding with students\n- easier exams\n- allows you to redeem yourself\n\nLaura brown cons:\n- exams are straight forward and don\u2019t prove that you truly understand the concept (could be a problem if you plan on taking the mcat)\n- felt like I forgot everything once the class was over\n- had issues with connecting some concepts\n\n\nBurlingham pros:\n- gives plenty of resources \n- always available and willing to help\n- great explainations for concepts\n- really pushes you to think about why and how something happens\n- truly cares about students learning\n\nBurlingham cons:\n- exams are brutal and require you to understand orgo on a deeper level\n- doesn\u2019t curve (sometimes will allow you to do corrections for some points back but not a guarantee)\n- can go fast in lecture\n- exams are 85% of our total grade\n\n\nUltimately, I would say that if you really want to understand organic chemistry as a whole, go for Burlingham. If you want to pass the class and move on, go for brown.",

I won\u2019t deny that the exams are challenging, but if you keep up with the material, they are very doable, especially if you are retaking the class.",

(MUS-Z 110) I really want to take cello lessons next semester at the jacobs school but I wonder if they have instruments to borrow or if I have to find one over the summer, and also if they teach people that have never played an instrument before?",

Your lessons will be with a graduate student.\n\nFair warning that Jacobs is a very good music school. It is likely the most prestigious school at IU. So the graduate students who are teaching there may be not be good with working with beginners. Hopefully you get someone in the music ed department. Please upfront with the teacher early about your experience and commitment level.",

I wanted to wait until after the weekend to choose my three preferences since they are major related. Does anyone in the sciences have feedback about doing the ASURE program? pros and cons? Is it better to go with the research that\u2019s just one semester or that is spring and the following fall?",

The research that has an extra semester counts as an advanced lab which is nice when trying to rack up upper-level credits for your major.",

Which one did you take? My options I like are 1) Antibiotics: silencing bacteria to stop infection 2) bacteria antibiotics and resistance 3)cellular and molecular neuroscience research lab",

For instance, for the Biology B.S [https://bulletin.college.indiana.edu/programs/4215/BIOLBS/](https://bulletin.college.indiana.edu/programs/4215/BIOLBS/) requires a biology lab that can be fulfilled by the asure biotech lab, a chem lab that can be fulfilled by the antibiotics chem lab, etc. There are a certain amount of upper-level credits you need to graduate and a certain amount of upper-level credits you need for your major.\n\n I took the bacteria, antibiotics, and resistance lab, we did a lot of work with microbiology and bacterial genetics. I know the antibiotics one is chem based and would count as a chemistry lab and I assume the neuroscience lab counts toward psych/neuro majors. \n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to DM me!",

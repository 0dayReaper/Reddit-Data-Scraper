I'd definitely say schedule your orientation asap to get in classes before they fill up and come in with a specific schedule in mind.\nYou can preview a course plan in iGPS (on One.IU) or you can probably find it on Google by searching ur major and whatever IU campus you want to attend. (You can also preplan courses on iGPS and show your advisor when you go in, they can tweak whatever is needed)",

In my very limited experience full time students normally stay around 12-16 credits, 17-19 for high achievers (you'll have a very heavy class load). Never heard of anyone doing 28. \nI'd definitely just keep it as a preplan for now so your advisor can get an idea of what you're looking for. Don't get attached to it as you may have some unexpected required classes pop up (First Year Seminar for example)",

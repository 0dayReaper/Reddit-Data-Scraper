ALSO would it be weird for a sophomore to rush a sorority like would i get bids or just immediately dropped? kk thanks :))",

            "comment": "Hi! I think most of the people who live in dorms are freshman, not saying that there isn't anyone who isn't also living in them, but from my knowledge it doesn't seem like that many. I think the best option for living on-campus though would be to look into the on-campus apartments. The ones on union street aren't too bad. Really depends how much independence and space you want. Renting can be a bit expensive, so I suggest looking at that first. I'd say overall southwest has the better dorms, central has some nice ones though, like teter and union street. As for rushing, I think a good amount of sophomores also rush. It wouldn't be weird at all, I know some who did and they got bids for places they wanted. Hope everything goes well :)",

            "comment": "I think mostly freshman live in the dorms. As for living situation, you could do on campus apartments, but from personal experience, i would recommend going with something off campus. The residential services are extremely difficult to deal with, in addition to the building managers being terrible and also difficult to deal with. Each building is different, but what seems to be consistent, is that they have ridiculous rules and the buildings tend to be pretty run down. \n\nThere are plenty of options that are pretty close to campus, I highly recommend City Flats on Walnut; the management is very nice and easy to deal with, the apartments are modern, not that far from campus, and the amenities are very nice (like I have my own washer and dryer). Other good places (that I\u2019ve heard of) is DunnPark Studios, Maxwell Terrace, Evolve, etc (there are lots of options). \n\nAs for rushing, I don\u2019t know, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were other sophomores that do it. I think they would totally let you.",

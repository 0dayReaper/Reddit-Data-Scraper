Traditionally plenty of kids apply pay the enrollment deposit and housing deposit then are no shows closer to the start of school year. There are even some kids who get assigned a roomie, then the roomie never shows up. The revenue stream importance of mandating on campus housing for freshmen is huge! In past years they have converted lounges to temporary bunk rooms and doubled up kids in rooms (3 kids in a room designed for 2) to accommodate all freshmen and be sure they have those housing contracts/dollars.  Then everyone eventually gets sorted to a regular room. \n\nIt was only during the height of Covid that they permitted freshman to live off campus.",

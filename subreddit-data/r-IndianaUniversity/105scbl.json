Any recommendations on which is a higher value for incoming Kelley students to attend? \n\nShe is planning on committing to IU so no need to \u201cclose the deal\u201d. \n\nThanks for your guidance\n\n\n\nEdit: thanks to those who helped. I couldn\u2019t find any specific info online.  Side note: not sure why asking a legit question gets downvotes but whatevs.",

I believe in the past there have been some online sections but I think you have to get special approval to attend those versus coming in person. Orientation is where students will meet classmates and register for classes.",

Direct Admit day is really cool and it was a great experience to be on campus while classes were going on. However, if you attend direct admit day, New Student orientation is basically just a regurgitation of the information from direct admit day and during new student orientation you are guided on how to pick classes. Hope this helps and congrats to your daughter!",

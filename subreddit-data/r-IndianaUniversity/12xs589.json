I did the latter and it left me with more time to enjoy my senior year rather than stressing about a couple classes that I really should\u2019ve taken before.",

It has been super helpful for me, it\u2019s a career class that teaches you everything you need to know to prepare for finding internships and jobs after college. It\u2019s pretty easy as well.",

I work on campus and I\u2019ve gotten at least 4 reminders to \u201cRSVP.\u201d Like, no.  I don\u2019t have time for this dumb event and the only way I\u2019d ever consider attending is if they offer crab legs and alcohol like McRobbie used to do for his holiday party.",

It\u2019s been funny to watch the prizes get better and better\u2013we\u2019re at courtside basketball tickets now. Who\u2019d have thought students might be in class on Thursday afternoon?",

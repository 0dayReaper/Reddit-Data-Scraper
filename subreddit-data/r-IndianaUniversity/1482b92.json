Nicks is a local bar and restaurant thats pretty important locally. There\u2019s local pizza, and local sushi there. Potbelly, Noodles and Co, Which Wich are also right there for some maybe more familiar options. Also just a block or so over is 4th street where there is a wide variety of foreign culture restaurants are, Thai, Turkish, Greek.\n\nEdit: if they\u2019re forming in the Southwest neighborhood, Mother Bears on 3 street is a pizza spot that they might be frequently this year, so that could be cool too.",

For dinner, I'd do Lennie's or Big Woods, which are both a short walk from Sample Gates.\n\nBeyond food... If they're into fossils or rocks, go to the Learning Lab in the geology building, or the Greenhouse in Bio if they like plants.",

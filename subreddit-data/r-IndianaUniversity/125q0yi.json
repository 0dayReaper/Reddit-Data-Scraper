    "postText": "I am an International Student, so planning everything for moving to Bloomington for my PhD is a bit overwhelming for me, so please bear with me and my questions.\n\nWhat are the housing options for PhD students at Indiana University-Bloomington? Is it possible for graduate students to live on campus, or is it only available to undergraduates? What are the best options for a first-time international student if on-campus is an option; if that is not an option, what are my best off-campus options?",

I would recommend looking at Campus View and Tulip Tree. I think many grad students and/or international students live there.\n\nThe grad students I know tend to live off campus either in the neighborhoods south of campus or east of campus along 10th street. I would avoid housing by the stadium as these are mainly undergrad areas with lots of parties &amp; noise. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that most leases are signed way in advance, think october/november for a lease starting the following august, because things fill up quickly. You can try looking on IU Classifed through one.iu.edu as people will post on there with available subleases, needing roommates, places to rent etc.",

A lot of the international grad students I know live on campus. \n\nOutside of campus housing, Ph.D. students and other grad students typically rent an apartment or a room in a house. IU has some rental houses set aside for staff, faculty, and grad students but they can be kind of pricey if you don\u2019t have a roommate.",

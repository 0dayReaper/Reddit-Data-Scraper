    "postText": "I have a physical disability. Not only do I have a permanent disabled parking placard, but I have to pay to park in IU disabled spots. I primarily TRY to park in the disabled spots by Ballantine. Unfortunately, other students seem to think they are entitled to those spots despite not having any sort of disabled placard, license plate, etc. You are not entitled to park in disabled parking just because you're dropping off or picking up a friend. You are not entitled to park behind disabled spots, preventing people with disabilities from parking or leaving. You are not entitled to park in the no parking zones between disabled parking spots that are meant to allow people with canes, walkers, wheelchairs, etc. to safely enter and exit their vehicles. You are not entitled to park in the road leading up to the disabled parking, despite the many no parking signs, and block disabled people from entering or exiting the lot. You are not more important than disabled people. I have had to miss or be late to classes, especially when it rains or snows, because entitled pricks decide that they're more important than people with disabilities and I can't find a place to park. I can't walk long distances. Park somewhere else, take a bus, stop being entitled and walk. I don't think people should have to be told to follow the rules and treat others with respect, but apparently, that needs to be done.",

The guy I see all the time is like my age, young, driving a black benz. It screams, \"My parents are rich,\" to me.

There used to be many such spots outside Ballantine before the university removed about 20 spots several years ago. Ballantine is one of the most populated buildings on campus. Someone moving a bunch of books into or out of their office, or a student with presentation materials or some other large object is not going to park two blocks away.\n\nI agree that people should not park in the disabled spots. The university, however, is partly to blame for this bad behavior.",

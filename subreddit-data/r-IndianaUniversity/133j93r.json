    "postText": "I just enrolled and am looking to complete housing (hopefully I'm not too late?), not sure about the dorms though, I didn't visit and the IU page is not very descriptive.\n\nI am a direct admit to the Kelley school of business for undergrad. However, if possible, I would like other majors as well instead of just Kelley kids...but the perks of kelley llc don't sound bad. Im also going for a double, and a dorm where people like to be social.\n\nBased on past reddit posts I've scoured, I've narrowed down the options I'm considering to the following(either bc I've read good things or I've read nothing about them)- Eignmann hall- Teter Quadrangle- Foster Quadrangle- McNutt\n\nAlso, where is the Kelley LLC going to be for this fall?\n\nAnd an also to the also: How can I best get the dorm I desirrrrre, or is it ultra crapshoot since I'm doing housing not very early?  \n\n\nEDIT: An also to the also to the also: I'm looking at my computing account and I have no idea which is the actual housing application I'm supposed to click. Anyone have the link to it? Thanks!",

Live in either McNutt, Briscoe, or Foster. \n\nJLLC kids are more 'nerdy'? I'm using that word sparingly, but compare them to another dorm,  there's less activity on weekends. It really depends on the type of person you are, your goals, and how you like to spend your free time. \n\nAlso if you are in the JLLC, you have to take T134 and T144 \u2014 two super easy A classes. Waste of time though.",

While you live among other business kids which is good for support, you will have more obligations in the LLC. Mcnutt is an okay dorm. All are Social. Hopefully for the Investment of time and money, you don\u2019t spend the majority of time in any dorm. Also if you have any or potential health issues, McNutt and Foster quads were all involved in the mold crisis and subsequent lawsuits.  While they eventually closed both for a year after the lawsuits, the bathrooms were not part of those renovations. Bathrooms at McNutt look like they did in 2012. The student news outlets said there were incidents of mold coming back in some of the mold crisis dorms after renovations. You can\u2019t do well in class or enjoy your collegiate experience if you are saddled with unnecessary health issues due to dorm conditions. Good luck with your decisions. Remember it\u2019s a preference not a guarantee where you get placed unless accepted to an LLC . They find out assignments first.",

About 16 different symptoms you can have. Everything from headaches, neurological, dermatological, and especially severe respiratory issues. Some kids ended up in the emergency room , in the hospital, some had  to withdraw. Found out later mold had been an issue for quite some time and other kids had  gotten sick, but the University never properly dealt with it and they were not obligated to disclose any past history of mold, fungi, or water damage. The depositions and filings of the class, action lawsuit are public record. Volumes of info. \n\nIt didn\u2019t help matters that the lawsuit later revealed a letter from housing leadership sent to the campus clinic asking them to downplay mold in the dorms as a cause for the record breaking number of students that year going to the clinic for help. \n\nBe careful. Get an independent qualified physician for care if you get sick. \n\nBathrooms in McNutt are co-Ed use. Can be used by anyone. Cleaned a few times a week by staff. Communal use.",

Second honest to goodness imo the best chance you have especially now for a request is the JLLC but honestly it\u2019s a crapshoot at best. There are tons of options some better than others for what fits you and obviously other pros and cons but as a whole the residence is what you make of it. Getting nothing requested and totally not thrilled with it at all turned out to be pretty great so try to go in with a positive attitude, understand it\u2019s a crapshoot and make the best of it \ud83d\ude0a",

I probably had the worst room out of my friends at other dorms as far as like the size and whatnot. I also didn\u2019t find much value in either of the classes or the networking lunches with  companies. That\u2019s just me. They were more of a burden on my schedule than helpful. \n\nI found it pretty social though. It wasn\u2019t \u201cnerdy\u201d or it wasn\u2019t like there was nothing going on the weekends. People that wanted to stay in stayed in and people that wanted to go out went out. Everyone was very nice and I made a couple friends, but my friend group was apart from the KLLC. \n\nBathrooms were little solo pods with a shower and toilet",

I\u2019m speaking as an undergrad, but I would think there is still a decent amount of camaraderie within the grad departments too. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve seen in my departments anyway",

Starting minimum wage was good, you submit your schedule so they schedule your shifts based on that, and you don't have to worry about taking time off for breaks because campus will close. And they schedule around your finals too so the finals week schedule is different from your regular semester schedule. I ended up finding an apartment with one of the girls I became friends with working in the library cafe and we're still friends to this day\u263a\ufe0f my other friends I met in my dorm. I highly recommend talking to people in class! One of my friends that I still see kind of regularly (like once a year as opposed to others I talk to on occasion but haven't really seen the past few years), we met at a house party because she was like \"omg we have a class together!\" And so I caught up with her that Monday and she's now one of my best friends \u2764\ufe0f",

There are so many people trying to achieve a similar if not the same goal as you so it's very easy to connect through comradery. Join clubs, go out and just explore the town, go to parties and gatherings, join a fraternity if you have the mula, talk to your classmates. IU is so diverse you're almost guaranteed to meet people with similar interests as you",

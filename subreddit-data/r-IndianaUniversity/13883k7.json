Your friend is getting As because they\u2019re doing the level of work expected for the program. Many humanities departments don\u2019t bother splitting hairs. Either you\u2019re meeting expectations for your research or you\u2019re not.",

When I came in they basically told us that we were expected to get As and A-s and Bs were considered bad for the degree and in our field. We were expected to meet certain levels of work and maintain them and if you did that you were going to get an A. If you weren\u2019t meeting those expectations then it was going to show in the grades and you would likely end up having to speak with your advisor or the DGS. That being said, this type of system isn\u2019t the case outside of the humanities (to my knowledge) and even some humanities programs don\u2019t run on that type of expectation.",

    "postText": "The dining situation clearly is of no concern to anyone in charge. In an effort to force the university to use the ridiculous amounts of money we have almost all paid for dining plans, local news reporters have been contacted to investigate the issue. I am looking for students of IUB that are willing to join a zoom session with a reporter tomorrow (9/16/2021) circa 7 Pm. If you are unable to attend or do not wish to participate, providing personal accounts and screenshots of the insane grub hub wait times and lack of available options would also be greatly helpful. One way or another, we will eat.",

Instead, they just have multiple places spread around campus that sell similar or the same foods.  \n\nAfter eating at Wright for a few weeks, I\u2019m getting tired of eating the same types of food.  The AYCTE places in Forest and McNutt give a little bit more variety than what Wright does, but I don\u2019t always want a buffet.  I just want to grab something and go.\n\nAs students, we can\u2019t deny the fact that there\u2019s restaurants and grocery stores off campus.  We all know this.  At the same time, the point of the meal plan, in my opinion, is to spend as little money as possible out of our own pockets on food or groceries.",

It's not the actual dining hall workers' fault, but IU upper management or somebody needs to step in and fix this not by a discount or some sort of coupon but by actually feeding us or completely refunding dining plans so that students can put the money towards groceries.  \nIdeally, it'd be the first option though, because many students don't have the space or transportation to actually shop for food.

I have seen dining hall wait times that are over 3 hours long. Dining halls shut down at odd hours of the day. I constantly hear of my classmates skipping meals because the wait times at dining halls are too long and they cannot miss class. It has been like this since day one and only getting worse.",

I was directed to attend physical therapy every day, and to work in a situation the doctor would allow.. After several weeks of this, I called in and missed 2 days of work due to flu, and let the physical therapist know, also.\nIU shut my medical care off because of \"neglecting medical appointments\", telling me in a letter.\nI went and saw John Shean, injury attorney in Bloomington. He said the legal improprieties of IU was his biggest business. He said what they did was illegal... and they KNOW it's illegal.\nThey count on most people never consulting with an attorney. They still save more money by occasionally \"getting caught\" than by just doing the right thing from the get-go.\nWhat I'm saying is: retain an attorney. Go see John Shean... IU just gets him mad. See what legal recourse you can force IU to adhere to.",

Even better is to minor in math. CS/Math will increase earning potential, MIS will not, in case that matters to you.\n\nNot sure if you mean Ecology (very cool, no clue about practicality) or Econ (fun if interesting to you, won\u2019t make a difference in recruiting when you\u2019re already a finance major). Either way, no minor is particularly hard or unmanageable.",

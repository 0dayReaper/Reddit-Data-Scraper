Because if your junior right now definently just enjoy your summer \n\nOverall there\u2019s not much to prepare for. If you can, I\u2019d recommend taking calc and/or finite over the summer if you don\u2019t have credit for them already and watch a few videos for accounting. Also if you have ap credits or a high enough act/sat score, getting out of the writing class will save you a LOT of time.\n\nBuis pres, Econ, and k201 you can\u2019t prepare for. My major piece of advice though is that you get an EARLY orientation date so you can front load your required courses so if you want to take sophomore classes freshman year you can take it second semester. \n\nidk how many credits your coming in with/what your major or goals are but you can pm me\nAnd I can go a bit more in depth. Good luck on the admission process\ud83d\udc4d",

Because Finite and Calculus are now \"for students who begin at IU Bloomington in the summer of 2023 and later, MATH-M118 Finite Math and MATH-M119 Calculus are required for the Kelley degree but are not required to be completed at the time of application to the Kelley School. Students should work with their academic advisor to create a plan for completion.\"",

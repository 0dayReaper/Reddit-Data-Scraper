Go out and meet people. Talked to the people in your classes talk to the people on your floor. If you meet someone in a fraternity try to hang out with them. If they like you you'll get invited to events. \n\nEvery chapter is different of even the same fraternitires and they are all different year to year based on what personalities of people that are there.\n\nBut if you like elephant walks go Fiji. That has been a rumor at every university I attended in undergrad.",

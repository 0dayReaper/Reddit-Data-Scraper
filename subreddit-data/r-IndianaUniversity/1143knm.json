These Reddit nerds are gonna downvote me but I\u2019m giving you real ass advice here. I\u2019ve been in this situation a few times. When I told the truth they basically said \u201ctough shit bud\u201d and I failed the class and had to retake it. if ur gonna make something up the key is not to give some generic excuse about being sick. It has to be something so specific and unexpected that there\u2019s no way you just made it up, but also not quite so outlandish that it is unbelievable. Something like your roommate had an rare allergic reaction and you had to rush them to the ER immediately. Apologize and say you\u2019d be happy to provide documentation if necessary. Maybe they\u2019ll call ur bluff, but if you know the professor is a hardo then the chances of this are probably lower than them simply saying \u201ctoo bad\u201d if you are upfront with them. Why? Simply because it takes more effort on their part to try to verify ur complex lie than to say \u201cno\u201d when you admit to having no excuse. Weigh the risks by all means but some profs are simply assholes that will not hesitate to fail u if it is convenient for them and this method has saved my ass multiple times. Most likely even if there is no makeup they\u2019ll just let you reallocate the points from the midterm to your next test instead of getting a 0. Good luck soldier \ud83e\udee1",

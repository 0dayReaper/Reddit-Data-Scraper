As far as I can tell there will be significant restrictions and IUs housing contract says they have the right to charge you for living there even if u r sent home. I\u2019m out of state and paying a lot - they didn\u2019t come close to my Fafsa EFC and when I tried to get help financial aid office said all the funds went to in state students. So I\u2019m supposed to buy all this stuff to stay in a dorm room for maybe 6 months - travel halfway across the country to take classes in my room - take out meals so eat in my room - who knows what on campus activities there will be - probably none - and possibly get sent home as Covid numbers escalate - and not get money back. It would be nice if IU would be more forthcoming on what they feel campus life would be like - and for sure make adjustments to housing and meal plan costs when students aren\u2019t there. I\u2019ve tried to call but just get message to email. I\u2019m seriously wondering why I picked this school. I expected more clear communications and fairness. I get the town will suffer but I\u2019m just asking for fairness. I\u2019d have no problem going if they clearly made costs adjustments for housing and food and made more effort to try to have some level of college life even if only in small groups.",

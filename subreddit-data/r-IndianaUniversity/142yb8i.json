Only negative as a freshman living there is that people tended to keep to themselves and it could be hard to meet people, but if it\u2019s a freshman building now that might not be as difficult.",

I lived in a 2 bedroom my sophomore year before living in a 1 bedroom. The sink being in the bathroom was really the only difference between the 1 and 2 bedroom. You get all the same stuff and furniture in the 1 bedroom, the apartment is just smaller.",

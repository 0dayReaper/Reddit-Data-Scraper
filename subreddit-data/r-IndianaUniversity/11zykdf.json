    "postText": "I was directly admitted to Kelley for the class of 2027. I was wondering if a Withdraw Pass and dropping a course second semester of my senior year could lead to admissions being Rescinded. This course was an extra AP Math class which was unnecessary for graduation. I also got a B the first semester i took this class it wasn't like I failed or anything. Please let me know!\u00a0",

I emailed my AC yesterday and haven't heard back yet. but based on everything else I have read that means that just graduate and don't get any Ds or Fs. and bc kelley isnt as competitive as wharton or harvard i hope my admission stays in tact.",

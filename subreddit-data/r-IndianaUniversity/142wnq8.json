            "comment": "lived there last year as a part of the luddy LLC. overall it's decent. rooms are alright but the way everything (beds, dressers, desks, etc) is arranged by default gives you like no free space whatsoever. i saw some people move their beds parallel to the wall instead of perpendicular, which helps a lot. \n\nbathrooms are fine as long as your floormates aren't dickheads, which unfortunately will probably be the case. they're pod-style which means there's a communal sink room and then three individual bathrooms with their own toilet, sink, and shower. no issues with privacy as long as you lock the door. would recommend using the handicapped bathroom (as long as you're not restricting access from any potentially handicapped floormates) as it is significantly larger than the regular bathrooms, which feel claustrophobic at times especially in the showers. lots of people will forget to flush the toilet, leave the toilet clogged, and generally forget to clean up after themselves in the bathroom. no one told me this before going into teter and i wished i had been able to prepare myself for some of the utter horrors i had witnessed in those bathrooms. \n\nthe study hub is a really nice place to study but it closes at midnight most of the time, i think during finals week they don't really care how long you stay. there are other amenities in teter like the makerspace and the kitchen, but those are LLC-only unfortunately. there's also the \"theater\" which is nice, a lot of people gathered to watch the super bowl when it happened which was a lot of fun. the lounge next to the elevators is also good if you want to get some late night studying done outside of your dorm, provided someone isn't playing the piano. there are also some practice rooms in the lounge which is nice if you play an instrument, they also have smaller pianos in there.\n\ni think the biggest upside to teter is the location. pretty much everything was walkable for me, even during the winter. ymmv obviously but wells library is like a 5 minute walk, it's pretty easy to walk to most dorms besides the ones in northwest campus, wright dining hall is like right next to teter and forest dining hall (the superior choice) is a 5-7 minute walk if you cut through the school of education. none of my classes were super hard to get to and were maybe like a 15 minute walk tops. kirkwood is about a 15-20 minute walk and there are bus stops right across from teter if you want to take the bus.\n\noverall, i had a decent time but my main issue was with my floormates. hope you have better luck than me lmfao\n\nedit: for further clarification i lived in rabb but your experience should pretty much be the same. also village pantry is pretty close if you need a quick snack fix at night",

                    "comment": "relatively certain i\u2019m apart of the dickheads your referring to, made sure to flush the toliet tho.\nmy biggest piece of advice when dealing with annoying floor mates is to talk to them directly. my friends and i never had an issue being quieter, or stopping whatever was disturbing somebody if they just asked. sometimes dickheads don\u2019t realize they are being dickheads (+ luddy llcers tend to be a more quiet bunch). so if you have an issue, just ask the person to stop and if they don\u2019t go to the RA.\nanother piece of advice is to lock your door!!! even if your in a learning community theft is common and will occur (more people will have access to your floor than your floor), i\u2019 had one incident during my time in the luddy llc where things were stolen in a matter of minutes while i left the door cracked when i went to the bathroom. and if that does happen call the police bc the RAs refuse to do anything about theft.\npeople will throw up in the bathrooms, people will forget to flush, however, you will be able to find another bathroom that isn\u2019t disgusting. make sure to bring shower shoes. \nteters location is its best quality for sure, you will have a much shorter walk to class than most and a short walk to forest if you get tired of wright food",

It's pretty centrally located. \n\nUnfortunately they are doing construction updating the interior of Wright the dorm next door so some of pass throughs will be blocked so you'll have to walk around the construction fencing instead of cutting through but shouldn't be too much of an inconvenience and the work is all being done inside so it won't be like there will be jackhammers going off outside your window on the sidewalks at 8am. Not sure if dining will be affected.\n\n[Edit: IDS article](https://www.idsnews.com/article/2023/05/wright-quadrangle-entering-first-phase-of-renovations)",

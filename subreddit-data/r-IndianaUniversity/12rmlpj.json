How\u2019s it look on the transcript?\n\nI know that the previous grade will be replaced and will not carry credit or factor into GPA, but I would like to know whether the previous letter grade will be replaced by \"X\", or whether it will remain but add some notation.\n\nFor example, if my intensive writing course is graded B, then I retake it and receive A. Will that \"B\" still be on the transcript?",

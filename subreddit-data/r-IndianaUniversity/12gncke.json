My friend who\u2019s a sophomore told me to apply to the Northwest neighborhood (specifically Brisco or Walnut), I just wanted to make sure these would be in my best interest. Connections wise it would probably be better to apply to the Kelley JLLC, but would I overall be better off at one of the northwest dorms?",

Although it\u2019s a bit nicer, I think year after year the people in Briscoe kinda suck. Many athletes live there, including the ones who think they\u2019re better than everyone else in Bloomington. Things could\u2019ve changed since I graduated but I would\u2019ve done McNutt over Briscoe all day long. Walnut was not open when I was at IU so I can\u2019t speak to it at all.",

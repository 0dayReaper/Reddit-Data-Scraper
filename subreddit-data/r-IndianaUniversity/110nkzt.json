            "comment": "Not all clubs are extremely competitive. Some are but others are easier and looking for new members. Just like a job interview extroverts may have an edge but be yourself and be confident. Applying to and interviewing for clubs is great practice for job interviews. That being said not all clubs require interviews and you can just join them by going to meetings and giving them your information. \n\nI would recommend going to the Kelley carnival at the beginning of the year to learn about all the clubs and get your name/face out there. Also there are many types of clubs (not all finance/accounting) so again the carnival would be helpful for you to see all of your options.",

Some of the clubs aren\u2019t updated regularly on there, so sometimes they\u2019ll have their socials linked in the description. If not, at least you have a list of clubs to look into at Kelley Carnival.",

I remember the group that focuses on mental health had a crazy high membership fee too. I get it was all for the club to be able to afford throwing all of these events but as a broke freshman, floating $$$ their way was pretty difficult.",

Or any suggestions you may have?",

Don't cut him off financially until you can assess this, if possible. If he is in an emotionally bad way, he may not be thinking clearly. One of our sons was struggling with depression/then guilt about school, and quit going to classes and hid it and avoided contact because of this (we weren't paying for anything, &amp; he was of age, so we had no leverage/control even if we'd wanted to use it). Later, when he was feeling better, he regretted just letting his classes tank to Fs, and had a long uphill battle to bring his GPA back up. He was on scholarships and loans, so it also interfered with them in the future. If he just doesn't want to be there, that doesn't matter much. Our nephew  tanked his freshman year with heavy Frat partying (another college/state); turns out he just didn't care/want to be there. My brother was footing the bill, and just stopped, let him be. Our son, years later, after lots of hard work, is now elsewhere  teaching/working on his doctorate.",

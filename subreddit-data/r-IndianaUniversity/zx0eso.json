Comic books are my special interests but it\u2019s between this class which take place at a time I\u2019d prefer not to have class and all the reviews say that attendance is mandatory and there\u2019s a lot of papers. OR I could take THTR-T 147\nMUSIC AND SOUND DESIGN IN HORROR AND SCIENCE FICTION",

Every week or two we had to write 500 words about an assigned reading, which was mostly pointing out artistic and literary elements within the comic. I can't remember if attendance was mandatory when I took the class; I attended every zoom regardless but it wasn't really necessary to succeed. If you're already big into comics, you probably know a lot about what the class goes over already and won't gain much from the class.",

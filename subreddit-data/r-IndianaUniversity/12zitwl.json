    "postText": "Hey everyone! I was accepted into a PhD program at IUB recently and immediately accepted. My question is, does anyone know the next steps? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m supposed to have a campus email yet or receive any information from the university rather than just my department? I have also been told I have a funding package tied to a student academic appointment, but have no clue what my job will be. \n\nI don\u2019t want to freak out because I was told there will be a grad student orientation \u201csometime in August\u201d but I just want to make sure I have all my bases covered until then. Thank you!",

I kept getting booted out though and contacted tech support who told me that my status is still listed as applicant rather than accepted student. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if things are a bit of a mess rn with the end of the semester approaching",

WildCare is a local nonprofit wildlife rehabilitation facility that can help with any animal situations you may have! If you encounter a baby animal, don\u2019t offer any food (formula at the wrong concentration or composition will kill the animal) but keep them warm, somewhere quiet and dark. Checking opossum roadkill can save up to 20 baby opossums per adult. WildCare\u2019s also always accepting volunteers in every part of their organization!",

I've volunteered there off and on (primarily during my time at IUB) and they are great. Just be prepared for cleaning because baby animals are *messy*! LMAO",

    "postText": "So I\u2019ve noticed lately there\u2019s been a lot of posts from incoming freshman asking a lot of admission questions, and particularly a lot of Kelley questions. Are you all getting a little annoyed with it?\n\nI understand this sub is meant to help others for IU related inquiries but every day there\u2019s more Kelley admittance questions that were answered less than a week ago. I really think there should be a rule where those questions need to be searched in this sub before posting a whole new thread. \n\nI acknowledge that I may just be being grumpy with this mentality but the questions being asked in here almost certainly must\u2019ve been addressed in emails. Furthermore, IU pays people to answer those questions more in-depth. Happy to hear your thoughts!",

Those subjects are basically the entirety of this sub, yeah there\u2019s the argument of \u201cjust ignore it\u201d but that mentality is gonna ruin the sub and cause people to not wanna use it. It\u2019s really not difficult to add a moderator bot and then create a couple mega threads per year. It would not only help improve the saturation of this sub, but it would also put all the freshman info in one place which is arguably way easier than just posting a question and getting comments saying to read your email, ask someone at IU, or refer to a different post.",

Less people are likely to regularly check a stickied \u201cquestions go here\u201d thread and then the kids who need help will have no answers.  I don\u2019t really see a downside to allowing simple questions I\u2019m posts other than the fact that it clogs the feed.  But then again this subreddit isn\u2019t really designed for constant content consumption. Most people who come here just want help or clarification.",

My concern is just that people using this sub for other reasons are pushed away. Room for all is all I\u2019m saying! I think every sub similar to this should have a rule about searching for previous posts up to say 6 months back before posting. Or in our case, having a mega thread related to housing and admissions. I really think it would be a win win for everyone. Hope that makes sense",

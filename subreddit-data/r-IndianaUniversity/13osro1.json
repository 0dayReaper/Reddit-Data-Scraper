    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all, I am currently planning on moving to Chicago in September, right after my new lease begins. I am looking for someone to sublet my room out in my apartment. It\u2019s a 3 bed/2 bath, you\u2019d share the space with my current roommates. All of us are queer and \ud83c\udf43 friendly, everyone usually keeps to themselves, the living room and kitchen are the shared spaces of the apartment. Rent would be $325 a month!",

I'm a transfem who graduated from IU this May, am clean and have experience co-renting with others, and would be eager to learn more! Please DM me with info and I can provide contact info, roommate references, etc. Thanks !!",

I was wondering if any past/present standard admits could give any tips/info on getting into Kelley. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

See if you can take M119 through a community college. If you took calc in HS you\u2019ll be fine but I didn\u2019t and it was a pain through IU. M118 was also difficult for me but for others it was easy so your mileage may vary. A100 moves quickly so keep on it. It\u2019s only 8 weeks with the midterm being in week 4. I recommend taking that the second 8 weeks of your Fall semester. Other than that I\u2019d advise against rushing until the Spring. You need to get a solid footing for college before spending time on other things. Just work hard, study, and keep the partying to a minimum and you\u2019ll be fine.",

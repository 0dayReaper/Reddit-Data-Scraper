Why is it the best pregame bar?\n\nBest bar to watch Hoosier football games? Why is it the best watch party bar?\n\nBest postgame bar after Hoosier football games? Why is it the best post game bar?\n\nAny information is extremely helpful and appreciated. I can\u2019t wait to see some of the responses.\n\nThank you",

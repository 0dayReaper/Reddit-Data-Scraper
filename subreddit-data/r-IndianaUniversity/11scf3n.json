    "postText": "We really need mobile or email notifications when classes become active on Canvas. I don't mean when we register, just when the professor makes them available to interact with. I logged in several times last week to do my assignments for my 16 week classes (grad school btw, so I am very much active in them). One of the two of my 8 week classes (undergrad, long story of another gripe) has been active for a couple weeks. Good, because we needed a textbook and I like to get mine through Interlibrary Loan at my local library if possible so I don't have to pay. That class due dates are \"end of the semester\". Cool. No worries there. My other class wasn't active yet. I assumed it must start after Spring Break, makes sense to me. Why start a class for a week, just to have a week off and pick up the next week? Today, I log in, because, yes, even though it is technically Spring Break, I like to make sure nothing is wonky with grades or anything. My final 8 week class is now active. Cool, I'll check to see if I need a textbook, read through the syllabus, blah blah, first week stuff. Except, I noticed that all the first week assignments were due last week! I emailed the professor. I guess I am doing homework on Spring Break. Awesome. I am a full-time working older adult, so Spring Break really isn't a thing for me anyway. But, that still rubs me the wrong way. A simple email or text alerting me would be awesome. That's my rant, off to do my missing assignments and hope I get graded for them.",

At MOST... someone might put in a feature request for a new notification type (course added to dashboard or something)... but all that will really do is potentially result in one of those public feature voting topics, as described here: \n\nhttps://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Community/How-do-Ideas-and-Themes-work-in-the-Instructure-Community/ta-p/2980. \n\nYou don't need UITS to do that, any Canvas Community member can submit ideas.\n\nReally, this is a combination of the prof not starting their class on the actual first day (implied, not sure what the actual start time was), and the student making assumptions as a result.",

They also sometimes do custom work for Canvas. Or maybe there\u2019s a notification setting that we don\u2019t see that they can change. \n\n\u2026 or submit an idea to the place you mention. \n\nIf you just wanted to vent about a professor that\u2019s fine, but your post starts with talking about what Canvas should do.",

I always send a Canvas message to my students that class has started and my site is open. However, I'm not aware of many instructors who would cancel the first week of class, even with Spring Break coming up. Esp w a shorter length class.\n\nThat said, it would be great to have a Canvas notification that a site is live.",

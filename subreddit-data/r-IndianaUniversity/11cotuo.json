            "comment": "Your first acceptance is to IU Bloomington.  You are then reviewed to see if you qualify as a direct admit to Kelley.   If you are directly admitted, you will hear from them in 4-6 weeks.  You can also petition to be directly admitted.  If you do not qualify for direct admission, you can still attend IU Bloomington and work to gain admission to the business school at then end of your first year. You must obtain a certain GPA your first year to qualify. If not directly admitted, you must roll the dice and hope that your college GPA can qualify you at the end of your first year.",

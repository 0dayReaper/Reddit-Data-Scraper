    "postText": "On the IU website Global Engagement is said to *typically* be between 1,000 - 11,000 $, my question as an international student, is that if you are a competitive applicant could you receive or apply to receive more than 11,000 through the Global Engagement Scholarship, or in other words could you get a scholarship greater than the typical amount as an international Freshman, (thinking of applying to the school of Arts and Sciences) ?\n\nThank you in advance to any responder!",

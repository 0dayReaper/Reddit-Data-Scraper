            "comment": "I actually interviewed for it last week. Asked the current members about their experience with the workshop. Essentially you meet once a week on Fridays, you discuss topics around the sports industry, and guest lecturers come in that you can hear from. It's an easy way to network and something to add to your resume. I'm sure there's more to it as well. They also said networking is the biggest thing you get out of it because you meet with professionals from all corners of the sports industry, so some might be in a field you're interested in, some might not be. But you get experience with professionals that have a wide experience.",

From the number of interviews I saw, there were about 50 or so people interviewed, and presumably not everyone who applied got an interview. It\u2019s a newer workshop so the prestige isn\u2019t as high, but Teamwork Online (If you don\u2019t know what that is, it\u2019s pretty much the most popular website for sports companies to advertise jobs) actually featured the workshop in a LinkedinPost recently. Compared to other workshops it may not be as prestigious yet, but it\u2019s been around long enough for students to get a career benefit out of it (some of the students I know who are graduating this year/last year have gotten jobs at companies where professionals who come talk with the workshop work at.) I can definitely tell you more next year once I actually experience it, but that\u2019s mostly what I know as of right now.",

You\u2019ve got sports teams, players, venues, etc. You\u2019ll have the more typical business jobs like marketing, sales, management, etc, but you\u2019ll also have jobs that are more unique like sports agents and general managers. Essentially just imagine everything about sports having something to do with the business behind it. That\u2019s what sports management is, and there\u2019s a wide variety of jobs. I\u2019ll focus more on the typical jobs, because most of the unique ones like sports agents and general managers have salaries that vary based on how much money they bring in/how professional the team they work for is. Let\u2019s say you want to work in ticket sales for a professional team, like an NBA team. The most difficult part about the sports industry is getting in. With stuff like lawyers, doctors, etc, while it\u2019s important to have connections, a lot of has to do with how much of an education etc you have. In the sports industry, while an education is important, having connections will ultimately decide if you get in and how far you go. I had a video conference with someone who went to IU and now works for the Washington Wizards. His path, which is pretty similar for most students who go from college to working at a sports team, is getting an internship at a sports team summer after junior year, the year after you graduate you work a year as an intern (so low pay or no pay at all), and then typically you\u2019ll get promoted, either through the team you\u2019re on or to another team. The person I talked with was interning at another NBA team (forgot which one) and he was recommended by someone from that team to someone who worked at the Washington Wizards which is how he got that job as a ticket sales analyst. Now I believe he\u2019s a regional sales manager. Salary essentially goes from low pay for intern, to maybe around 40k-60k for a base line sales analyst (or maybe more/less with commission), and then as a manager you\u2019d probably get closer to 100k a year. And higher as you get promoted. \n\nBut yeah, biggest takeaway is that you pretty much have to have a connection to get into the industry, and the maximum amount of pay is probably around 100k-200k unless you\u2019re like an agent for a player who\u2019s making millions.",

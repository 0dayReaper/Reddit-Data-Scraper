    "postText": "So I live in Eigenmann right now, but due to some medical circumstances, I requested to move. They made me an offer for Briscoe, which is definitely not what I wanted (although sadly beggars cannot be choosers).\n\nMy two main fears:\n1. It\u2019s far. I\u2019m an arts major so most all of my classes are in the auditorium or the southeast area. I\u2019m afraid that this would be such a pain.\n2. It\u2019s in northwest. One part I love about eigenmann is that it\u2019s usually pretty dead. I\u2019m more of an antisocial person, and while I do like to party from time to time, I am mostly a more chill reserved person. I\u2019m scared for the kind of people that live in northwest, and I\u2019m scared of how insanely busy and crowded it always is.\n\nHowever, it would be good for me health wise. I know health is first, but if I can\u2019t even get to my classes or feel comfortable in my living space, it\u2019s not worth it.\n\nSo should I move?",

According to Google Maps Eigenmann is a [14-minute walk](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Indiana+University+Auditorium,+East+7th+Street,+Bloomington,+IN/Eigenmann+Hall,+Eigenmann+Hall,+East+10th+Street,+Bloomington,+IN/@39.1697269,-86.518139,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x886c66bf1fcb1459:0x93786a1bf8045bb9!2m2!1d-86.5181604!2d39.1684839!1m5!1m1!1s0x886c66a4c8c133ab:0x93e703b18a53add4!2m2!1d-86.508803!2d39.1711586!3e2) (0.7 miles) vs. a [16-minute walk](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Indiana+University+Auditorium,+East+7th+Street,+Bloomington,+IN/Briscoe+Quadrangle,+1225+N+Fee+Ln,+Bloomington,+IN+47406/@39.1733642,-86.5219419,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x886c66bf1fcb1459:0x93786a1bf8045bb9!2m2!1d-86.5181604!2d39.1684839!1m5!1m1!1s0x886c66b7cb3865b5:0xc94cfd25bea81730!2m2!1d-86.5196522!2d39.1782297!3e2) (0.8 miles) from Briscoe. Biking is an excellent option if you can. It cuts the walking time down to a third.",

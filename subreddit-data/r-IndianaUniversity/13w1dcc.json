    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm transferring away from IU and looking for someone to take over my lease at reserve on third for next year (July 29th, 2023 through July 26th, 2024). The unit is fully furnished, with a washer and dryer in unit, and each bedroom has an attached private bathroom and walk-in closet. The rent is 570 per month plus electricity (internet, water, etc is covered). This is an individual lease for one room in a 3 bed, 3 bath unit. I've lived here for the last year, and have no complaints. Good 6 bus access, and has a shuttle to and from campus. PM me with any questions.",

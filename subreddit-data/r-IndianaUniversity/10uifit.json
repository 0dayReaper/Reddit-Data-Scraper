    "postText": "Hello, I am a current freshman at Purdue, majoring in physics. First semester, I got a 3.08 GPA. I will likely do better this second semester, not sure how the second semester will effect my application tho considering I am applying rn, although the final transcript will come in before the June 1 deadline.\n\nIn high school I got \\~3.5 UW \\~3.9 W, 1510 SAT. Obv I will send my SAT, but I'm not sure if I should submit my high school transcripts (apparently it's optional which was surprising to me) because I got 3 Ds second semester senior year, and matched with my average grades first semester it might show a downward grade trend\n\nWhat are my chances at admission? And would you recommend submitting my high School transcript or not? Should I wait until second semester is over to submit my application or does it really matter?",

Physics here will be about average for a state school in the midwest, but your minor can make a huge difference in your career path and employability.\n\nA buddy of mine majored in physics at Purdue with a minor in computer science.  He was also a bit of a gear head.  He spent most of his career designing / programming the optics for headlamps and tail lamps of cars for Big3 and Tier-1 automotive.  He still loves it and still works.\n\nI majored in chemistry at IU with a minors in physics and secondary education.   I spent most of my career in labs (especially materials science) analyzing customer samples, writing reports, and helping to sell them bench instruments for polymer composites analysis.  I frequently traveled to customer sites to train them as well.  It was very rewarding for me, but I retired in my early 50s.\n\nIt all dovetails in the end.",

I thought you all would really enjoy it!\n\nIf you want to support me so I can make more stuff like this, instructions are available for purchase [HERE](https://edacity.gumroad.com/l/eocnqy)! \n\nAnd if you can't do that, I completely understand. Spreading it also helps a ton!\n\nBut either way, have a wonderful day!",

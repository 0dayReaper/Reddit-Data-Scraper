    "postText": "I'm a senior in HS and IU is one of my top choices. I'm planning to rush in the fall and just wanted to post on here to ask: what are the top frats? are the hazing stories somewhat still true? I heard from a friend at IU that events are suspended right now but just wanted to ask anyway.\n\nFor context, I've basically lived through greek life at SMU throughout my high school years since so many private school kids from Dallas go there and I am friends with them. I'm generally familiar with the experience but just wanted to get the scoop on IU's greek culture.",

            "comment": "Top frats can vary year to year based on probation, suspensions etc but historically they would be Sigma Chi, Pi Kapps &amp; Fiji. \n\nHowever, most of the guys in these frats know each other from the same handful of high schools in the Indy or Chicago burbs. Or they have a rich af alumni dad. \n\nIf you\u2019re not in one of those 2 categories you\u2019ll really have to put yourself out there as an Alpha Chad to get a bid. I wouldn\u2019t get too hung up on the specific house and just go wherever feels like the best fit. Don\u2019t be a try hard or come off the wrong way, first impressions are super important.\n\nHazing is not that bad anymore, the university cracked down hard on frats starting about 8 years ago",

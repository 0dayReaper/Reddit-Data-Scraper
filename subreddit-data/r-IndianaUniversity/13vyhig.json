    "postText": "I don't have a car in Bloomington and I'm planning a trip to Columbus, IN in about a month. I'm not staying overnight, but I'll be in Columbus for the whole day.\n\nI'm confused on the round-trip / one-way booking system that Zipcar has; what's the \"designated parking\" for Zipcars supposed to mean? If I'm driving out of town, would I book round trip, or can I just book two separate one way trips? Seems like booking round trip is a LOT pricier given that it still charges me even when I'm not using the car.\n\nAppreciate it!",

            "comment": "You have to return the car to the exact location that you pick it up from. So any trip is one round trip and not multiple one-way trips. You can't start in Bloomington and then end at your destination to restart later at your destination to return to Bloomington. Zipcar doesn't rebalance the cars like the e-scooter companies rebalance the scooters so this is the system. \n\nMost cars are parked a majority of the time so yea, there's always a cost even when we aren't using them. Cars kinda suck like that. You could think of the cost of a Zipcar relative to car ownership - I would guess that renting a Zipcar is cheaper than gas, insurance, oil changes, monthly payment, etc. I haven't done the math.\n\nAlternatively, is there someone you can share the ride with or a friend that will let you borrow their car?",

    "postText": "Just an hour or so ago, I got off of the late shift from working at one of the libraries. I waited at an intersection, the one right in front of village pantry, and I heard a car pull up beside me. The cars were rolled down and someone inside started barking at me. I knew where this was going so I ignored them, staring ahead. But then came the \"Hey! HEY!\" The light turned green and the car pulled away, but I saw a car full of young men filming me with their phones. I wish I had thought to take a picture of their license plate number, but my legs were shaking.\n\nIt seems like this semester, I've been yelled at from cars in the exact same way a handful of times. It's always a car full of the stereotypical frat boys (sorry) with their windows rolled down who stop at a light or a stop sign. It doesn't matter if I'm alone or what I'm wearing. (Though, when I am alone, they're much more bold.) \n\nMy guess is that these boys are finding some cruel humor in it for themselves or they're trying to be a big man in front of their brothers. \n\nBut for a woman walking alone, this sort of occurrence is extremely disturbing. To be frank, whenever this happens to me, I think to myself, is this it? Is this the time that they go further than just yelling from a car? And when the moment passes, I get so incredibly angry. Why hadn't I screamed at them? Or thought to take a picture of their car? Anytime I see a car with it's windows rolled down, I tense.\n\nIf you know someone someone who does this sort of thing or if you see it happen in front of you, please say something. I'm hoping that if they understood how threatening that sort of behavior is, they'd stop. But, in the mean time, I'm getting a knife.",

Way too many ppl act stupid without their mommies and daddies to tell them what to and not to do.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s mild, like letting the trash overflow, eating too much candy (I\u2019m guilty of this ngl), and being loud. But sometimes it escalates into getting drunk and doing shit like this\n\nToo many people have not learned real discipline or self-awareness, and simply make their decisions based on whether or not their parents are managing them.",

Sometimes it\u2019s just \u201cAYYYYYY!!!\u201d, I\u2019ve had people say things I can\u2019t decipher, I\u2019ve been barked at. You name it, it\u2019s probably happened. I\u2019m not entirely sure if this happens more commonly to females, but it sure as hell happens to me a lot. Just some dudes tryna have fun as they drive past people walking I\u2019d assume (in my case at least).",

            "comment": "If you can find a TA position (in a class that has no lab section for you to run), you may be able to host office hours virtually. And of course, you can grade assignments at any time of day. That's all heavily dependent on the class and professor you work for, but it's something to think about. AFAIK, all undergrad and graduate TAs are **capped** at 10 hrs/week.\n\nThe UITS Support Center might let you work fully remote. They're very good at working with students' class schedules, and since they're open 24/7, they can schedule you for any time of day. Keep in mind that you would receive a weekly schedule that doesn't change until the semester ends, so it's not something you can change up all the time. Plus, you have to work a **minimum** of 20 hrs/week there.\n\nBest of luck!",

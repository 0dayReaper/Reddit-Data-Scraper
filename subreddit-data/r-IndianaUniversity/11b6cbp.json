IU looks like a better academic school than Rutgers or FSU but its going to cost more for me to go there. I want to know if I will get better opportunities at IU than Rutgers or FSU. Thanks!",

I think it\u2019s mainly due to how competitive New Jersey\u2019s applicant pool is makes it really hard for smart kids there to get into the same top schools without being super cracked. Cause IU\u2019a fairly well ranked, makes it a good safety for high achieving kids from competitive states. \n\nHonestly though, IU has a lot of opportunities you just gotta have a fire under your ass and always look to improve and reach out to upper class men for help.",

Plus, it's in the central neighborhood so I don't find it to be too far away from anything. Only problem is that the walls are super thin lol",

That's not to say there wasn't activity, but it's certainly not a party dorm. There is a general mix of people living in Willkie, but I think your experience is going to end up being what you make of it. I wouldn't change it, and I'd even say most of the people who didn't want Willkie ended up liking it. \n\nYou could always try for a single dorm in a different enhanced building, where there's a mix of singles and doubles.",

IU is planning on tearing it down soon (eventually), so it's the last priority for any maintainance or repairs. IU mostly uses it as reserve housing for COVID quarantines, students who abandoned their first room choice, or summer housing.\n\nThere will likely be roaches, the walls are thin, and it's typically hard to meet people there. Living there will be generally fine, but there's no reason to choose it.",

It was Named as part of the moldy dorm class action lawsuit. Unless this is the only thing in your budget. Lots of student social media posts about how awful it was when used as the Covid quarantine dorm. If you have of potentially have mold allergies or sensitivity, be cautious. Most people love Wilkie. It has central air but somehow escaped having all the windows bolted shut by the university after the mold outbreak in dorms. There\u2019s a few videos online of flooding in some rooms that kids had to be evacuated from last year,so again depends where in Wilkie you end up and any health issues you may have. More money but more privacy. Ashton is all singles. Wilkie , 2 kids share a joint bathroom you have to clean yourself.",

Ashton is a quad of old dorms all built at the same time. Kids live there because of exceedingly low price, they want a single for sure, and it had Windpw AC units. Which means you all can never open a window for fresh air. The floors in your room are glazed concrete.",

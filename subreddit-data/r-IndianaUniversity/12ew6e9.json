I'd like to know how the course and university is from someone who has a first-hand experience of the same.\n\nI have heard that the course, faculty and university infrastructure is amazing. The only drawback people have pointed out is the location in terms of networking and job opportunities.\n\nAny input on the how the experience would be during Masters there is appreciated. This will really help me decide if I want to consider IUB.\n\nThanks already!",

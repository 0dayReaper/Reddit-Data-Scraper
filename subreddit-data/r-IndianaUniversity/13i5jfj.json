            "comment": "Sad. The food institute was a great space for students to come together and bond over food and meals. It was one of the only hubs for grad students across different disciplines at IU who were studying food and agriculture to congregate at round tables. And several student groups utilized it as a space. Many a memory was made at the food institute and many people\u2014often from different cultural backgrounds and not from the US\u2014were able to share stories, eat food that was unique to them, and educate one another. The campus farm is much farther and is off campus, and doesn\u2019t have a kitchen or inside space. Although resources are scare and have to be allocated somehow, I do hope eventually it comes back in some form. I would love to see more spaces for social capital to thrive at IU.",

            "comment": "&gt; Indiana University's Food Institute has closed its doors after its operating budget was eliminated to prioritize \"critical investments in graduate education.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; The duplex on North Park Avenue \u2014 where for nearly a decade hundreds of students have cooked in the kitchen, pulled research from the shelves and socialized in the living room \u2014 will no longer serve as the heart of food studies at IU.\n&gt; \n&gt; Leadership learned only a few months ago the institute's $80,000 operating budget was no more.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"We have no space. We have no personnel,\" James Farmer, interim director of the Food Institute, said. \"We can keep the website up because it doesn't cost us anything.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Steven Barnes, executive director of the College of Arts and Sciences' communications and marketing, said the decision to close the Food Institute was multifaceted and part of recent efforts to \"steward College resources and prioritize our critical investments in graduate education.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; While its programming, which includes an academic certificate and student-led data initiative lab, is slated to reappear elsewhere on campus, institute personnel mourn the loss of a dedicated space where cuisine, coursework and connection among faculty and students all co-existed.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"It'd be like, 'Hey, let's have a campus farm, but you don't actually have a farm,'\" Farmer noted. \u201cWe can go in and bring in a guest speaker (and) we can rent the room over here. Sure, we can do that kind of stuff. But the Food Institute was primarily about people engaging in real human moments with each other.\u201d\n\n...\n\n&gt; \u201cIt was about the research and outreach and engagement that are gone now,\" Farmer said, adding while food research has existed in the anthropology and geography departments for decades, the institute was the only hub that connected such interdisciplinary work with out-of-class student engagement. \"But the importance of being able to bring it together and have it organized \u2014 that's what's hard to replicate: the outcomes that are derived from that intentional organization.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; The Food Institute even had its own piece of academics by spearheading the food studies certificate. In addition to coursework on campus, the certificate requires internships, where institute personnel connected students to farms, wineries and restaurants.\n&gt; \n&gt; In March, during a routine budgetary meeting, Farmer had planned to ask for an increase in the institute's budget to expand its programming. To his surprise, it was then that he was told the Food Institute would be losing its operating budget, effective by the end of the spring semester.\n\n...\n\n&gt; The institute's programming will be spread across the university in the near future. According to Barnes, the college is looking into incorporating the institute's Critical Foods Studies Lab into the Arts + Sciences Undergraduate Research Experience. This will take some time to develop, Barnes said, noting it could potentially be available in the fall 2024 semester.\n\n_________\n\n&gt; The College has ceased funding the IU Food Institute. That will mean no director, no assistant director, no 405-407 North Park St., and no operating budget. What is left, you might ask? Over the past eight years, we have convened scholars, students, and community members at the Institute to advance conversations and awareness regarding issues related to food and agriculture: environmental, political, economic, scientific, social, and cultural. In one form or another we plan to continue those conversations.\n\nhttps://foodinst.indiana.edu/index.html\n\n&gt; **Research Projects**\n\n&gt; Food Insecurity and Poverty\n\n&gt; Black Farmers and Land Access in Indiana\n\n&gt; Institutional Food Purchasing Power and Activism on Campus\n\n&gt; Emergency Food Programs\n\n&gt; White Supremacy and Discrimination\n\n&gt; Food and Service Access in the US\n\nhttps://foodinst.indiana.edu/research-outreach/cfsl/projects.html\n\nPublications: https://foodinst.indiana.edu/research-outreach/cfsl/publications.html\n\nMore detail on the page.",

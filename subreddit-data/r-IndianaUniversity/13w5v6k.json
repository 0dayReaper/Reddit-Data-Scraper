I\u2019ll never forget that when they laid us off for COVID they said we could come get a free medium pizza every single day until we got our jobs back, I mean that was months and months. \nAlso off campus, if you can get a job at a bar and stick with it, eventually you can become a bartender and make more money than just about anyone without a degree in Bloomington. And more money than tons of people with degrees, this type of life can hold people back though. The money is so good it\u2019s easy to get complacent, and you\u2019ll probably start drinking a lot.\n\nStay away from: any Dining Hall job on campus, awful jobs. Please be nice to the poor souls that end up working there, many are hard working international students.. that is the worst job on campus.",

Really best advice is just speak up and answer several questions in the group stage. There might be like 40 people in the room but they\u2019ll only ask 10 questions and only ask those who raise their hand to volunteer. So stand out in the group interview as well as completing the paper application.",

College is different than high school and it takes time to develop healthy routines.\n\n100% get a job that doesn\u2019t follow you home either.

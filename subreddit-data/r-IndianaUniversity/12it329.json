M106 isn't advertised much but everyone in class are all people who don't like/struggle with math. You'll have to wait until your sophomore-junior year to take it though as the courses fill up with upperclassmen. I tried taking finite through Ivy Tech last summer and dropped after 3 days... don't let people fool you finite through Ivy Tech is not immensely easier.",

Usually the classes are smaller, however , IU did have done resources Ivy Tech didn't in mathematics such as incredible Math Lab! I hated math but had to get good at it for chemistry and grad school. I'm a wiz at it now and a go to person for this subject now.",

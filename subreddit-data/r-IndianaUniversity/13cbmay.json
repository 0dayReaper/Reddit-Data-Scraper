However have seen a few comments saying people are unsure if the credit is still transferrable for C/O 2027. Will I be able to take it this summer at Ivy Tech and transfer the credit to IU?",

Advisors have told me over and over again that the university has no plans to stop accepting the credits.\n\nThe transfer credits don't count towards your gpa. Could be a benefit or not depending on your situation.",

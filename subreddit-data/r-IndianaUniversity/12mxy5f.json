It got kinda weird fast. He would constantly snap me, find me at parties and try to dance with me or go further. It got so bad my friends were noticing and the free alc wasn\u2019t even worth it. I eventually had to block him and stop going",

My roommate was in with those guys and they used to throw events at our place. I was going through it at the time and didn\u2019t have the energy to put up a fight about it. Just a nightmare having that many people in your basement and some pretty dangerous situations ending up happening. Their videos make me laugh though \u201cturning up\u201d with like 500 people squished in, a million degrees, and no alcohol. They did an event at the showalter fountain which made me laugh. So cringy that he\u2019s still doing that. I was tired of those open parties immediately",

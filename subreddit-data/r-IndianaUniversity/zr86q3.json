Their advice was to include the test scores no matter what and just explain he\u2019s a horrible test taker. He actually was accepted into IU fine. He also applied for a direct admit to the media school. He was denied however they told us to appeal it with a great write up as to why he\u2019s so passionate and would be a good fit, but mostly because NO ONE EVER appeals because of the intimidation. So he did and got approved no problem. And, actually probably most important, he missed the deadline for the appeal even because we hadn\u2019t got this advice yet. So he called the media school and they gave him an email to send to the director. He emailed him back with approval within 30 mins. They want to see your \u201cfight\u201d show them!  I think you\u2019ll have a great chance and don\u2019t stop at No there are always many ways to get to the end result. Praying you get in! \ud83d\ude0a \u2764\ufe0f",

As if you went in as a Direct admit, its only a 2.0 and above to remain in Kelley. There are also some weed out courses you will take: K201 , Finite math , and maybe A100. Now I don't mean to discourage you but these are the current circumstances, but if you put in the work, you'll be fine.",

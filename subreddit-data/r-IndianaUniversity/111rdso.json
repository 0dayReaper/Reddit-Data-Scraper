    "postText": "Hey everyone \ud83d\udc4b \n\nSo this might be a weird question, but I am just dying to have this sandwich again and I need help recreating it. I\u2019d go down to Bloomington and try to get one but I don\u2019t know 1. If they still sell them and 2. If I would be allowed to buy one as a non student\n\nSo, information: I went to Bloomington for 2 years, 2015-2017. During that time I, like many, had some classes at Ballantine hall. On the first floor (I think?) there was a little convenience store that sold sandwiches and paninis that was pretty popular. The line was always decently long, anyways. I would consistently get this panini that was an herbed focaccia bread with cheese in between. Basically just a grilled cheese. But oh my god it was so good. One of my favorite things on campus aside from forest\u2019s burgers. \n\nSo my dilemma is this: I can make focaccia just fine, and I\u2019m 99% sure it\u2019s as close to the bread as possible. And obviously I can make a panini. But I cannot for the life of me remember the cheese that was in this sandwich. I know, any cheese that I like would probably taste just fine and be plenty good. But I really want THIS sandwich. I can\u2019t even remember the colors of the cheese. Swiss maybe? It was a blend I think. \n\nIf anyone has any idea what this sandwich is, or knows what the cheeses are that they used, I would be so eternally grateful. \n\nWeird inquiry, I know, but im obviously still obsessed with this sandwich 8 years later so. I need to have it again.",

I know they had a meatless version, which I presume was the same 3 cheeses and tomato slice.  I\u2019d have had this at campus dining around the 2012-2015 timeline or so.",

I\u2019ll give those three a whirl, thanks! Those could very well be it, because it was definitely a blend, and definitely milder cheeses.",

I'm only marginally familiar with the Ballantine store down there, but I don't think this particular sandwich exists anymore. I'm more than willing to take a look tomorrow though.\n\nIn the meantime, a lot of sandwiches on campus this year have provolone, which is similar to Swiss and has a pretty distinct flavor when melted. Maybe give that a try?",

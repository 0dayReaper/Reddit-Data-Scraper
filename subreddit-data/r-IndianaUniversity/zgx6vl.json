What we know so far.\n&gt; \n&gt; Each year, IU sees about 250 to 300 new faces in the faculty, made up of permanent faculty members and those who are visiting the campus temporarily. In addition to the regular campus shuffle, IU is expected to grow its faculty by 100 positions. The staffing boost goes along with the three big priorities for the Bloomington campus: improving the undergraduate experience, investing in graduate programs and expanding the university's breadth of research.\n\n...\n\n&gt; The new positions will not be created all at once. Instead, Shrivastav expects to hire around 20 to 30 new faculty each year.",

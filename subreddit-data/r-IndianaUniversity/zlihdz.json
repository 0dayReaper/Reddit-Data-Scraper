And you should! Take the W earlier in the semester next time, pick up a second 8 weeks class to stay fully enrolled if necessary. This all comes with experience, and usually that is understood, so an F earlier in the academic career is usually not too consequential..",

So if it was this semester (or a previous semester, of course) it's too late -- but depending on the circumstances, the prof might be amenable to an Incomplete (if this semester) and/or student services to get accommodations or a W (e.g. for physical or mental health issues, disability services or student advocates office depending on the situation; can even happen retroactively for a completed semester).",

Iirc the class changes your grade and gives you the credits you missed. I\u2019m not sure if it removes the original F from your transcript though. I *think* retaking may change the initial GPA impact you got from the F, but I\u2019m basing this off of a statement I vaguely and don\u2019t fully remember from my counselor back in high school, so don\u2019t rely on me.\n\nI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re a freshman like I am. If that\u2019s the case, don\u2019t stress to much about an early F. Just learn to overcome whatever shortcomings you\u2019ve had this semester for the next one and your other years here.",

    "postText": "Saturday, May 6, 2023\n\nBLOOMINGTON, Ind. \u2013 It is with sadness that the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music announces death of Menahem Pressler, distinguished professor of music in piano and Dean Charles H. Webb Chair in Music, at the age of 99 years. \n\nPressler died peacefully today, Saturday, May 6, in London, England. He joined the Jacobs School of Music faculty in 1955 and received the Indiana University Medal in 2013.\n\nCo-founding member and pianist of the Beaux Arts Trio, Pressler established himself among the world\u2019s most distinguished and honored musicians with a career that spanned more than seven decades. He continued to captivate audiences throughout the world as a performer and pedagogue, performing solo and chamber music recitals to great critical acclaim while maintaining a dedicated teaching career.\n\nDavid Henry Jacobs Bicentennial Dean of the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, Abra Bush, said, \u201cMr. Pressler was a brilliant pianist, an extraordinary teacher, and gentle soul who has left an indelible mark on generations of pianists around the globe. He believed that his \u2018performance informed his practice, and his practice informed his performance,\u2019 and he loved nothing more than practicing! His loss is an enormous loss for us all, but his presence will continue to be felt through his students, past and present, for decades to come.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nBorn in Magdeburg, Germany, in 1923, Pressler fled Nazi Germany in 1939 and emigrated to Israel. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHis world-renowned career was launched after he was awarded first prize at the Debussy International Piano Competition in San Francisco in 1946, followed by his successful American debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra under the baton of Eugene Ormandy. Pressler\u2019s ensuing tours of North America, Europe, and the Far East included performances with virtually all of the world\u2019s leading orchestras.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter nearly a decade of an illustrious and praised solo career, the 1955 Berkshire Music Festival saw Pressler\u2019s debut as a chamber musician, where he appeared as pianist with the Beaux Arts Trio. This collaboration quickly established his reputation as one of the world\u2019s most revered chamber musicians. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWith Pressler at the trio\u2019s helm as its only pianist for nearly 55 years, the New York Times described the Beaux Arts Trio as \u201cin a class by itself,\u201d and the Washington Post exclaimed that \u201csince its founding more than 50 years ago, the Beaux Arts Trio has become the gold standard for trios throughout the world.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe 2007-08 season was bittersweet, as violinist Daniel Hope, cellist Antonio Meneses, and Pressler took their final bows as the Beaux Arts Trio which marked the end of one of the most celebrated and revered chamber music careers of all time. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPressler continued to excite audiences throughout the world, both as piano soloist and collaborating chamber musician, including performances with the Juilliard, Emerson, American, Cleveland, Pacifica and Eb\u00e8ne quartets, among others. Nearing 90, he collaborated with tenor Christoph Pr\u00e9gardien, playing Schubert\u2019s song cycle \u201cWinterreise\u201d for the first time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFollowing lifesaving surgery in 2015, Pressler resumed his robust teaching and touring schedule in the United States and Europe. In 2017-18, he again toured the United States, Europe, Israel, and Asia giving recitals, playing chamber music, as soloist with orchestra and giving master classes. In 2018, he again performed across the United States, Europe, and Japan. \n\n\u00a0\n\nEqually as illustrious as his performing career, Pressler was a master pedagogue and had prize-winning students in all the major international piano competitions including the Queen Elizabeth, Busoni, Rubinstein, Leeds, and Van Cliburn competitions, among many others. His former students grace the faculties of prestigious schools of music across the world and have become some of the most prominent and influential artist-teachers today. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIn addition to teaching his private students at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, Pressler presented master classes throughout the world and served on the jury of numerous international piano competitions. In 2019, he was invited to join the jury of the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow. Many contemporary composers wrote works especially for him including three works by Kurtag.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAmong his myriad honors and awards, Pressler received honorary doctorates from the Manhattan School of Music, University of Nebraska, San Francisco Conservatory of Music, the North Carolina School of the Arts, an Honorary RAM from the Royal Academy of Music London, and an honorary doctorate from Ben Gurion University Be\u2019er Sheva. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe garnered six Grammy nominations, lifetime achievement awards from Gramophone magazine and the International Chamber Music Association, Chamber Music America\u2019s Distinguished Service Award, and the Gold Medal of Merit from the National Society of Arts and Letters. He was also awarded the German Critics \u201cEhrenurkunde\u201d award and election into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. \n\n\u00a0\n\nIn 2005, Pressler was honored with two additional awards of international merit: the German President\u2019s Deutsche Bundesverdienstkreuz (German Cross of Merit) First Class, Germany\u2019s highest honor, and the Commandeur in the Order of Arts and Letters award, France\u2019s highest cultural honor.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn 2007, he was appointed as an Honorary Fellow of the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance in recognition of a lifetime of performance and leadership in music. \n\n\u00a0\n\nFurther honors and awards include the prestigious Wigmore Medal (2011), the Menuhin Prize, given by Queen Sofia of Spain (2012), inductions into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame and the Gramophone Magazine Hall of Fame (2012), and the Music Teachers National Association Achievement Award. Pressler received the 2015 ECHO Klassik Lifetime Achievement Award in Germany and the 2016 Victoire d\u2019honneur Lifetime Achievement Award from the French Victoires de la Musique Classique.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPressler recorded almost the entire piano trio repertoire with the Beaux Arts Trio. In 2015, Decca released a 60-CD set of the trio\u2019s complete Philips recordings comprising some 122 works. Additionally, he compiled more than 30 solo recordings.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe piano legend\u2019s second volume of the complete set of Mozart sonatas for the La Dolce Volta label was released in 2017. His CD of French music for Deutsche Grammophon, \u201cClair de Lune,\u201d was released in 2018, and his Schumann recording featuring \u201cDichterliebe\u201d with Matthias Goerne and \u201cKinderszenen\u201d for Harmonia Mundi was released in 2019.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPressler\u2019s DVDs include a live recital, concertos with Paavo Jarvi and the Orchestre de Paris, and his Mozart concerto for the Berlin Philharmonic\u2019s New Year concert with Simon Rattle, transmitted live worldwide in 2015. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPressler\u2019s own 90th birthday concert, live from the Salle Pleyel in Paris, was recorded for DVD and CD with the Eb\u00e8ne Quartet and Pregardien, among others.\n\nThe documentary \u201cThe Life I Love: The Pianist Menahem Pressler\u201d won Grand Prize at the Golden Prague International Television Festival in 2015. \n\n\u00a0\n\nBooks honoring his life and legacy include \u201cMenahem Pressler: Artistry in Piano Teaching\u201d and \u201cAlways Something New to Discover: Menahem Pressler and the Beaux Arts Trio.\u201d In 2016, a book of conversations with Holger Noltze, \u201cDieses Verlangen Nach Sch\u00f6nheit,\u201d was published in Germany by the Koerber Stifftung.\n\n\u00a0\n\nProfessor Pressler will be deeply missed at the Jacobs School of Music. May his memory be a blessing. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWe will update the Jacobs School of Music community as information about a memorial service or funeral arrangements become available. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0",

Personally, I would attend some info sessions, ask older students, or meet with the study abroad advisors if I was completely stuck but I would just start by reading the descriptions and looking up each program individually (like if its through CIEE, direct study with the school, exchange program) and see what their websites say.",

Buy power adapters before you go. \n4. Please take an umbrella. \n5. Figure out as much as you can on the phone front (ie service) before you go. \n6. Trazy.com is gonna be ur bff (its a website that offers discount on tourism stuff. Check it out. Really good deals and helps you find things to do)\n\nThose are my type 6 tips. If you want more I am always down to chat but most of my tips became outdated when covid restrictions loosened lmao.",

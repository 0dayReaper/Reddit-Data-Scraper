            "comment": "If your referring to the requirement that many majors have of a foreign language, then I highly recommend one of the Scandinavian languages. At IUB, they have Norwegian. You'll find that a lot of languages like Spanish and French can be complicated, almost like putting together an equation- maybe you've seen the memes about one's French professor being pissed because they forgot what gender a toaster oven is and whether it's being discussed in the present, past or future tense. I started taking Spanish and devoted hours each day to keep up, and eventually dropped it for Norwegian. Significantly easier and ranked among the easiest to learn. It sounds like your speaking English while drunk. I'm cruising through it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the 'world culture' requirement, I recommend one taught by Jason McGraw, or one involving music. Something with broad appeal, it'll make the homework easier.",

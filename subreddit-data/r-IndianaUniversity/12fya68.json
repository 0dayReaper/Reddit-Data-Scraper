    "postText": "For context, I am going to study at Kelley and enter the university as a freshman this fall. \n\nAny advice for the JLLC essays and specific ways to answer them?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are the prompts for reference:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The JLLC is a place where students have the talent to succeed, the humility to grow, and the tenacity to persevere. Please describe a single moment in which your talent, humility, or tenacity led to an unexpected learning moment in your life.  \n\n\n2. Describe an issue you are passionate about, and explain why you are passionate about it.  \n\n\n3. Identify a person you admire and explain what you have learned from this person\u2019s life. Please do not select someone to whom you are related.  \n\n\n4. (Optional) What else would you like us to know about you? With your answer, please help us identify you as one of the best potential contributors in our community.",

The committee can tell. Be honest. \n\n3. Use your best writing skills. Some people can write these the day before and be fine, others can\u2019t. I always just recommend to use your best writing skills and take your time. \n\n4. If you can make them unique without being totally out of left field (i.e. someone you admire you can be creative with but don\u2019t choose like Kim JongUn or something and think it will win you any brownie points), then do so. A lot of them talk about \u201chelping people\u201d or \u201cinnovation\u201d related issues. Stand out.",

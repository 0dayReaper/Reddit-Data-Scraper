(maybe)\n\nCons for Rice:\n\n* Too expensive ($54000 for one-year tuition) so it will take longer to pay off the loan\n\nPros for IUB:\n\n* Way Cheaper than Rice\n* Larger Alumni network (because of more people)\n\nCons for IUB:\n\n* The location is Bloomington, so it will be harder to get jobs &amp; internships in tech\n\nIf you have anything to add please tell me.",

            "comment": "Bloomington is close to the Indianapolis area. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re speaking of jobs and internships while enrolled or over summer breaks etc obviously that matters. But if speaking maybe while not in full time but breaks summers, semester off etc there are lots of close by options even up to Chicago etc. Ultimately being \ud83d\udcaf% honest what matters most is that you CAN succeed wherever you go. Mental health comes above all else and sometimes that means being closer to home or it may be there are more opportunities for your happy places whether that\u2019s a hobby or club or somewhere to practice your faith or you have friends you know going to close by or even the same college. I am a parent \ud83d\ude09 and I will tell you this every single one of my kids (and I have 4 sooo lol \ud83d\ude1d!!) \u201cjust knew\u201d when they hit that right place for them. And honestly as a parent I \u201cjust knew\u201d every single time too. I never fully outright told them what I thought as in this is where you should go. That is absolutely not for me to decide not to say as a parent. I did go over the pros and cons with them and give my small insights I saw. In the end if your mental health is awesome and you graduate you are doing so much more there many others ever achieve. That\u2019s not putting those that don\u2019t make it or choose not to go to college down at all. I was 27 before I graduated college and my husband is not a college graduate at all and yet we earned the same amount of money per year \ud83d\ude09.  A little wisdom you may or may not have heard yet but maybe take note if you haven\u2019t \u2764\ufe0f\u2026Its honestly kind of astonishing how a couple things in life really do just give you a \u201cyou just know feeling\u201d. In my experience they are 1. College choice\n2. Getting married (I know\u2026I know\u2026divorce rates~~BUT trust me if you aren\u2019t in \ud83d\udcaf% and your questioning anything about it you DEFINITELY need to dig further into why you are questioning it so much! Don\u2019t ask me how I know \ud83d\ude09but trust me now that I have the most amazing husband EVER of almost 17 years YOU JUST KNOW!! \ud83e\udd70\n3. Buying a house~when you find the one~you just know\u2026now full disclosure on this one sometimes it\u2019s just not meant to be even though you know (9/10 I find it works out great but there are those moments that are out of our control ie say another buyer who is paying cash ooof etc.)\n\n\nLast thing if your mental health is good and you believe you can truly handle and enjoy the more affordable option~~~my personal opinion go with \u201cyou just know\u201d but also go for the affordable choice work your tail off and I promise you will succeed in all the other ways. Over Half my kids aren\u2019t even using their exact degrees and I think one has had to submit his in-depth stats and college degree full spread info and it ended up not even being a point of contention. Also just fyi I have 1 son with the exact degree you speak of if that\u2019s helpful at all.   Praying for wisdom and peace about what wisdom is given to you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\u2764\ufe0f",

            "comment": "Coming from someone who went to IU and whose sibling went to Rice, I feel like I can weigh in on a few things.\n\nThe college experience you'll have at each of these schools is completely different. IU is, of course, a large public school on a large campus in a small-ish town with a pretty substantial presence of Greek life. Rice is a small private school on a small campus in the middle of a big city with residential colleges.\n\nI can't speak as much to the degree you're after and the pros/cons of each school for that but I would think hard about the type of college experience you want to help differentiate the two.\n\nPro for either: your school will host an amazing Spring event centered around bikes (Little 500 or Beer Bike) haha \n\nGood luck!!",

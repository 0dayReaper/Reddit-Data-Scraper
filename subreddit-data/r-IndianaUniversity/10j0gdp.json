Keep your head up and work on some social skills. You\u2019ll find your true friends quick sorry you\u2019re going through this",

If your goal is to go to multiple parties every week and get wasted, there\u2019s no more convenient path than joining a frat. As far as what to do if you don\u2019t join a frat \u2014 literally anything else. Don\u2019t pigeon-hole yourself into adopting other people\u2019s interests to fit in \u2014 find people who are interested in some of the same things as you and talk to them. \n\nI\u2019m an older graduate student, but I certainly remember feeling lonely as a freshman at a big school, and how difficult it seemed (at times) to meet people and make friends. As you get older, you start to realize that as intimidating as it can be, everyone wants to make friends and connect with other people, but not everyone is brave enough to put themselves out there. My advice is to be brave and try to talk to as many people as you can \u2014 in your classes, in your dorm, waiting for the bus, whatever. Some people won\u2019t want to open up, but you\u2019d be surprised how many friends you make just by being friendly.",

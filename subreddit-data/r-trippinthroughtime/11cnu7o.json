Maybe more so, since there was no real science to medicine then. [Purging and bloodletting](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4513889/) were the most common treatments of physicians which is more likely to harm the patient than help. A philosopher talking about fatalism would be better.",

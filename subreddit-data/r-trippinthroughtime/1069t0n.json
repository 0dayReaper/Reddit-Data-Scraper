So she kept nodding off in class, and after the like 4th time the teacher yelled at her to wake up she fell asleep right after, so the teacher assumed she was on drugs, let her sleep, then delayed the next period class, my twin woke up with both deans surrounding her, the teacher, and 3 cops. They thought she was going to wake up in a drug filled rage or something when it was just benadryl. Imagine waking up to that, I would've pissed my pants.",

                            "comment": "lol. Im just a dweeb who reads about myths and religions around the world and other subjects. lol\n\nEros was the greek deity of male love. He was the male counterpart to Aphrodite. \n\nThe Romans also had a male deity of love, but they called him Amor or Cupid. After the church came into prominence and power, sexuality became suppressed. To be fair, the greeks were kind of the atypical ones actually, because they were so sexual. But I think part of the church's asexuality was in response to that. \n\nSo anyway the christian influence, and influence from general sexual suppression, caused people to reimagine Eros/Cupid as a child or infant. \n\nSo greek versions of him were a beautiful man, bisexual or pansexual. Like in the story of Psyche and Eros (the head and the heart, or the heart and the soul). Eros falls in love with a human woman, and his mother Aphrodite puts her through all kinds of trials until she proves her love for him is true. \n\nThere are also different versions of Eros. Because the greeks would often have different versions of their deities. So we've all heard of Nike, the shoe brand. And it is named after the goddess of victory, named Nike. The statue of Nike was located in Athens, and she was probably an aspect of Athena. So she would be called Nike-Athena. (In Rome, Nike was called Victoria, and that is the origin of the common modern name.) Dike was the goddess of justice, and in my opinion that is probably the origin of the modern slur for lesbians. \n\nSo Eros had a few different versions. one was the deity of requited love, one of yearning love, one of unrequited love, etc. And that is why in the Sistine Chapel, the famous ceiling painting, there are a bunch of different little cherubs. They are supposed to be the different deities of love, or Cupids. \n\nI had to look up the painting, and it is titled \"A young girl defending herself against Eros\". It is by Willaim Bougueraeu, a french painter from the 1800s. I had never heard of him or seen this painting before. But I had seen his painting of the goddess of dawn, Eos. There are a bunch of his paintings in the gallery section on his wikipedia page. He also has a couple famous paintings of Psyche and Eros, with Eros in his greek form of a handsome man. \n\nAlso, slightly unrelated, but all the greek deities were bi. Hercules had a bisexual sex temple. Apollo (the sun) had many male lovers, such as Hyacinth (a flower). Poseidon had a few male lovers, and honestly they probably had many more but the stories have been exclusively told as hetero for centuries in order to avoid ridicule, criminal charges, and because of the inner homophobia of the scholars and historians over the centuries. \n\nOne example is the god/dess Herm-Aphrodite. She is a combination of Hermes/Mercury and Aphrodite. So she has both male and female genitalia, and she is supposed to represent many things, such as the inner mind of all humans, how we have both male and female aspects in all of us, and also neither, non-gendered aspects, and so on. So that's where the word \"hermaphrodite\" comes from. There are a few statues of the deity Hermaphrodite, although I'm not sure how old they are. \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William-Adolphe\\_Bouguereau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William-Adolphe_Bouguereau)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping\\_Hermaphroditus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Hermaphroditus)",

While Greek and Roman myth were similar they aren\u2019t the same religion (though some philosophers of the time claimed they were). Syncretism was a thing, yes, but they were still different religions up to a point.\n\nEros wasn\u2019t the male counterpart to Aphrodite either. Eros was a god of sexual or passionate love while Aphrodite could embody different types of love. Eros also didn\u2019t just have power over men, he had power over men and women, like Aphrodite so it wasn\u2019t like \u2018Eros is the god of male love\u2019 \u2018Aphrodite is the goddess of female love\u2019 they were just love gods.\n\nAlso, you sort of mentioned it but sort of not. In some myths about Eros, he was born from Chaos instead of Aphrodite and was stronger than the Olympians, while in some he was the son of Aphrodite instead. \n\nThe gods also weren\u2019t all Bi. A majority of them do have stories about being with both men and women, but some only have stories about being with one gender, and some don\u2019t feel any attraction (Athena and Artemis primarily)",

In his realistic genre paintings, he used mythological themes, making modern interpretations of classical subjects, with an emphasis on the female human body. During his life, he enjoyed significant popularity in France and the United States, was given numerous official honors, and received top prices for his work. As the quintessential salon painter of his generation, he was reviled by the Impressionist avant-garde.\n \n**[Sleeping Hermaphroditus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Hermaphroditus)** \n \n &gt;The Sleeping Hermaphroditus is an ancient marble sculpture depicting Hermaphroditus life size. In 1620, Italian artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini sculpted the mattress upon which the statue now lies. The form is partly derived from ancient portrayals of Venus and other female nudes, and partly from contemporaneous feminised Hellenistic portrayals of Dionysus/Bacchus. It represents a subject that was much repeated in Hellenistic times and in ancient Rome, to judge from the number of versions that have survived.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/trippinthroughtime/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

It depicts the grief-stricken Russian tsar Ivan the Terrible cradling his dying son, the Tsarevich Ivan Ivanovich, shortly after the elder Ivan had dealt a fatal blow to his son's head in a fit of anger. The painting portrays the anguish and remorse on the face of the elder Ivan and the gentleness of the dying Tsarevich, forgiving his father with his tears.\n\n\nhttps://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_the_Terrible_and_His_Son_Ivan",

It's the only nation (millions of people) that's somehow fundamentally evil, with terrible, terrible culture. I've literally never heard of Ivan the Terrible to be \"one of the most glorious leaders\". Nobody even talks about him. He is not important to us, he's just a figure from a history textbook. I remember writing essays at middle school about this painting (it's part of every school's curriculum), and his main characteristic that was discussed is how cruel and paranoid he was.\n\nYour another point is that he was one of the most psychopathic rulers ever to exist, but he was actually as cruel as many European rulers of the time.\n\nAbout the love for Stalin: maybe about 50% think he was a great leader, while another half of the nation hates him for many reasons, but who cares. Every thread on VKontakte about Stalin arouses huge debates with a few people who believe he achieved many good things, while others criticise him for his cruelty.\n\nThe world isn't interested in these Russians: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VuoIQNHiU0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VuoIQNHiU0)\n\nUpdate: wow. Thank you, kind redditors, I didn\u2019t expect this comment to be upvoted! I think I\u2019d assumed that the entire world hates us, and I just genuinely appreciate your support. I honestly don\u2019t know people who would support Putin or Stalin, and I hope they\u2019re a loud minority, though it\u2019s really hard to judge the statistics nowadays. I read about a lot of \u201ccrimes\u201d every day (someone reposted something against the war, someone spoke against Putin, 10 years to Sasha/Alexandra Skochilenko, etc.), and this fascist government is going nuts. I hope Putin suffers a lot before he dies for what he\u2019s done with Ukraine and Russia!",

I do also believe that vast majority of those people left Russia at some point in their life.\n\nI also do believe that Russia as an institution is a pure evil that corrupts it's inhabitants and it has been doing it since it's very founding. Dreadful history, evil politicians, horrendeous propaganda. There is a very good reason why ex-soviet countries hate Russia with passion.",

Why should they be forced to leave their family, friends, and the rest of their life behind due to the actions of people they have no control over?\n\nAnd when they're the type of people to support (or even join) protests, I'd rather they'd stay than leave. At least that way there's people pushing back against the propaganda, in one way or another.\n\nPlus, we're assuming here that everyone has the resources to move to another country, which is obviously false.",

It comes with a green bulb syringe (is that what they\u2019re called?) but that syringe isn\u2019t very effective. Its main issue is not producing enough pressure for a long enough time, but it could get the job done with enough patience.\n\nThe EZY kit comes with a soft-tipped syringe with 3 holes that shoot water in 3 directions at fairly high pressure. With this, you can more easily dislodge impacted ear wax than with the bulb syringe. For *minor* wax buildup, this syringe is good enough to work on its own without the wax-dissolving solution. However, you don\u2019t necessarily need this kit if you buy the other kit.",

Mostly because he runs exactly as much as he wants and lazes around the rest of the time.\n\nEdit: a word",

The general idea is that each person has a public key and a private key, and if I want to send an ecrypted message to someone, I use their public key, which everyone knows, to encrypt the message, then give them the message. They can then use their private key, which only they know, to decrypt it and read the message. The exact specifics of how all this works are very complicated, but an analogy a professor gave me once is to imagine the process like a physical mailbox. Anyone can use the public key to put something into the mailbox, but only the owner, who has the private key, can remove things. \n\nNow, with that general idea in mind, some important issues arise. The one at play here is the question of how to be sure a given person is really who they say they are. For instance, if I needed to send something to you, how do I know that the public key I have which is supposedly for u/DirtyAmishGuy is actually you, and not just someone pretending to be you? Like a lot of internet technologies, there is not some singular entity in charge who is responsible for making sure cryptographic keys are only used properly. Rather, the system in place is more of a network of trustworthyness. One way that people in the cryptography community enforce and improve this trust is through the abovementioned parties, where the intention is to prove identity in person. Once you do so, there are systems in place for other users to say \u201cyes, this is really the person they claim to be\u201d. \n\nHopefully that al makes sense, and I can go into more detail if you\u2019d like, but that\u2019s a general overview",

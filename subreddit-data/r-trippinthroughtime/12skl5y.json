If everyone would be taught to be confident regardless of what society thinks of their actual value, that wouldn\u2019t work anymore, at least not as well as it does currently.\n\nConfidence is also rewarded because it enables you to keep performing under pressure. Telling you why you shouldn\u2019t be confident is a form of pressure. While it would make more sense for society as a whole to only expose you to as much pressure as is needed for you to build your confidence up, a lot of the other individuals (that make up society) compete with you for resources and don\u2019t really have an interest in investing time and effort into nurturing you that way. Instead they just freely apply pressure and filter out the people who can\u2019t withstand it. Could turn out differently in less competitive forms of society but I guess we\u2019ll likely never know. Feelsbad",

Good luck divorcing him in the era this was painted in, society will shame you and women can't inherit.",

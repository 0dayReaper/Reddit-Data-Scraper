            "comment": "&gt;Theodor von Holst Bertalda Assailed Spirits.  The subject is taken from the short tale Undine (1811) by the German writer Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9 (1777-1843). The heroine Bertalda is tormented by a host of fantastical creatures, conjured by the wicked supernatural creature, K\u00fchleborn. These have been sent in an attempt to drive her away from the household of the hero, Huldbrand, and the lovely water-nymph Undine.\n\nMy note: she was not the heroine. Undine was the heroine of the story.  Burtalda was actually kind of a jerk who stole Undine's husband.",

Once the Romans ransacked Greece and renamed their gods, these fools had to become someone or something else in order to benefit off of that worship, prayer is their ambrosia. They never say dead gods it's always the \"Old gods\". Immortality  seems to have its bounds too, imagine going hundreds or thousands of years without food yet u cannot die. Poor bastards envy us because of that madness.. \nAll this is theoretical of course. In reality we don't even know what's more likely to be happening monotheism or polytheism",

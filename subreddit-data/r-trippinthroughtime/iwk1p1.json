I\u2019ve seen similar things with fire fighters these days. Like I get all the homophobic Navy stuff about being out to sea but if you just survived being sunk by torpedos or shot by planes, it makes sense you\u2019d need some emotional support. Not even mentioning watching your friends die in front of you. It is a weird boomer/greatest generation creation to be so homophobic and push that to the concept of masculinity I think. I wish gender and queer studies would push more research on that and not just trying to convince people now to change their view but expose a view that\u2019s been fluid over time. Just my useless two cents.",

It's not like straight people there have any human rights protection either. I don't think these examples show that Chinese people are more homophobic than any other non-western middle income country.",

But that's also oversimplifying the conflict. They've been disagreeing on a whole host of domestic and international policies, ironically switching from Stalin being the idealist and Trotsky the pragmatist in 1918 to Stalin having no qualms with working with people opposed to socialism ideologically. Like supporting Kuomintang over the Communist Party in China. Trotsky's last writings on Stalin are also filled to the brim with very personal hatred so there's that as well.\n\nI should have perhaps phrased it as \"focus on war\", since the shit hit the fan for gays when Stalin's repressions started to pick up in 1934 and hit in full swing in 1937. No one can to this day tell what the reasons actually were, but the most persuasive arguments were that the USSR was preparing for war. And Stalin wanted there to be absolutely no dissent as the Soviet armies were preparing for shit to hit the fan.",

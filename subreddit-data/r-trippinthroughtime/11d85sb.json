So, I typed out this long thing telling him that we could play a game where we pick states and the first to find a state where a non-Catholic hasn\u2019t diddled a kid in the last 4 years wins. \n\nWhen I hit reply I found out that the mods had not only locked the thread, but they had deleted our comments.

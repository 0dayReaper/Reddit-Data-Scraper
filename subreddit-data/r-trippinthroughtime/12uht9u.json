Just before the summer starts. But the booty is random according to the years. It remains largely dependent on the weather on the plateaus of the country of Sault in the Aude, **where Paul Luttge, installs hives, queens and bees.The beekeeper,** respectful of the environment and the land, produces a handcrafted honey, always cold extracted.\"\n\nI read this segment and assumed that it required bees.\n\nEDIT:\n\nOk so I looked further into it and found different website where it explain how to make vegan dandelion honey. In summary it says:\n\n\"\"HOW TO MAKE VEGAN HONEY  \nPick the flowers  \nBoil them with water to harvest the fragrance of them.  \nStrain the flowers away and reduce the flower water together with sugar and a splash of lemon.\"\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, basically, it's a sugar syrup with the aroma of a dandelion? It supposedly tastes more lik honey because of the floral hints!?",

I don't know where you live (I'm in Germany), but you may find them at shops locally. I believe my local Edeka (a grocery shop) even carries it.",

Since drones' only purpose in life is mating (during which they die anyways), and they don't do any work besides that, beekeepers see them mostly as unnessecary. Many beekeepers even regularly cut out male brood from frames, because a type of parasite (varroa mite) likes to live and breed there. Even bees themselves don't care much for males, since they chase them out of the hive to die at the end of summer, when they are no longer needed.",

Outside of concerns about farm treatment, most vegans oppose dairy because the male calves are culled (as they can't make milk) and the dairy cows are sent to slaughter after 5-ish years/pregnancy cycles when their supply slows down or they become sickly (they can live 15-20 years). They males are generally used for veal and rennet (the stomach is used for making certain cheeses), and the dairy cows are generally stew meat as they get old and tough. \n\nIt's the same with eggs, the male chicks go straight to the grinder and the female chicks are eaten after they've made their eggs. I can't get attached to my parents chickens for that reason lol. I get not everyone lives in rural/farming areas though, so I understand people not getting a chance to know about this stuff.",

So these virtue signalling concern trolls who use Joe Rogan as an authority are not only contributing far more to animal abuse, but they also contribute to far more plant abuse they care so much about as well.\n\nWeird how once they get exposed on abusing animals equal to or even smarter than dogs and cats, they suddenly become plant activists. Ass juice leaks from the noses of these hypocrites.",

It is not meant to be a strict term with hardline rules. If that were the case, you can\u2019t have pets (though there are some vegans who feel that having pets is exploitive too). It is simply impossible to wholly avoid harm.\n\nWhat is *possible and practical* for one person may not be possible or practical for another.\n\nAlso, say a person is starving and all there is to eat is meat. That person is still vegan even if they eat the meat. Or even something as small as a person having a hard time finding sugar alternatives (*all* agriculture results in the death and harm of countless insects, you would literally have to grow all your own food in order to not harm any bugs) choosing to continue to eat honey for their own well-being. That person is still a vegan because it was never meant to be a strict and gatekeeping term.\n\nAnyways. There\u2019s a reason honey is a hot debate topic within the community. People don\u2019t all agree. Especially when you consider a lot of people farm their own honey.\n\n(Also, Watson didn\u2019t start the movement on his own but he did coin the term \u201cvegan\u201d and helped found the vegan society way back when)",

We humans value animals. So we better not abuse them. Eat plants or abuse animals, two options. Whatever the reason we have laws, we also protect the animals. Whatever though, who cares about laws am I right!?\n\n&gt;Most of human history there was such a shortage of food and variety that I bet you were pretty much stuck with whatever you got your hands on\n\nYeah humans resorted to rape, killing, cannibalism and theft. Luckily we are not animals anymore no pun intended. **Eating an omnivore diet is a privilege.** Poorer countries literally can not afford to waste their limited resources on making animal products, as they are far more costly than healthy plants to produce.",

It\u2019s a crude devices. It similar to a meat grinder. They force the bees in and grind them up. What comes out is a paste. That paste is later filtered into what we know as honey\n\n_He was talking about a honey extractor machine that spins the beehive frames a speed that removes the honey. There are no bees inside it._\n\nETA: I can't believe I have to say this but y'all know that all people are different right? I just saw a video of a brunette person doing something stupid, and yet I didn't feel the need to comment \"they're not brunette, they're just an idiot, I'm brunette and I would never do that\" because just because they have one thing in common with me doesn't mean they're the exact same person as me. Some vegans are idiots, that doesn't mean all vegans are. Calm down. No need to downvote someone who said it's possible for stupid people to be vegan too jfc",

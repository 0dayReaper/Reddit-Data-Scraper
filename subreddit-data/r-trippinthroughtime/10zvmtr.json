            "comment": "In La Clairvoyance (1936), Rene Magritte delivers a self-portrait of himself painting a bird. But, as with all of Magritte's work, there is so much more going on. Not only is he painting a picture of a bird, he is using an unhatched egg as his point of reference. Magritte is painting more than what is right in front of him: he is painting the possibility, potential, the future. Hence the name of this painting: Clairvoyance. Magritte has painted himself painting his perception of the future.\n\nBy infusing himself into this picture and entitling it \"Clairvoyance\", Magritte is delivering a message about himself as the painter: he is clairvoyant, he conveys the future through his art. This painting is therefore as much about him as a painter as it is about the resulting artwork.",

When Cosimo de' Medici rebuilt the convent, he commissioned Fra Angelico to decorate the walls with intricate frescos. This included the altarpiece, the inside of the monk's cells, the friar's cloister, the chapter house, and inside the corridors; around fifty pieces in total. All of the paintings were done by Angelico himself or under his direct supervision. Out of all of the frescos at the convent, the Annunciation is the most well known in the art world.\n\nhttps://wikipedia.org/wiki/Annunciation_(Fra_Angelico,_San_Marco)\n\nEdit: This meme is officially cursed. Lunch didn\u2019t agree with me and now I am dead.",

A ceramic bowl can support your weight, how much extra weight are you adding before it cracks? You can't lose more weight than you had to start with, so I don't see how Ron could've evacuated enough mass to break the bowl since he would've had to eat up to such a ridiculous weight before he sat down. Unless the point is that there was so much force to his evacuations that liquid shit managed to hit the side of the bowl hard enough to leave cracks. Unfortunately I can't really find any data on pressure washers v toilets or anything along those lines so I can't know for sure how hard you'd have to push it out, but it must be a gargantuan exertion.

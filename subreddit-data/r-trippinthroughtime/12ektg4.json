Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\" and \"Sense and Sensibility\" are great stories exposing the culture. Also Ken Follett's \"The Pillars of the Earth\" tells the story of building a great Cathedral thru many generations during the Middle Ages. Its a great read that also shows the culture of the times. These  are all big books, but I promise, once you get started you can't put them down. Please read, books are windows, thru books we see other worlds. Oh, and forget about movies. I love movies but Hollywood screws up the history. There used to be a TV show called History vs Hollywood comparing the two. It was pretty funny.",

Instead of a civil reply letting me know it was a joke I got what seemed like a sarcasticput down. Not to be mean, really, the whole world isn't your age or follows your references. I had 4 older brothers the government was trying to send to Vietnam. Nixon was in office. We had serious issues, some life &amp; death. I'm shortening this up...On a quiet night, Kenmore Square Boston, I was sitting on a stoob with a Black man talking away the boredom. We witnessed 3 B.C. coeds lying to cops about 3 guys hanging under a street light They were trying to have them arrested over nothing. My friend made the mistake of trying to let the cops know we were witnesses. They dragged him down into the gutter and all 3 cops beat him mercilessly with their nightsticks. I tried to holler the truth at them. Finally I had to scream up to the dorms that lined the square to save my friend's life. A riot ensued, plenty of arrests including me. In Court a big beefy cop testified that 5'2\" 103lb me threw him down a flight of stairs.The judge looked at me and dismissed the charges. My Black friend was a Decorated Army Sergeant who was getting ready for his 3rd Tour in Vietnam. He arrived in his dress uniform dripping with medals and a row full of Officers for his defense. Charges dismissed. I'm going to stick with the Cat subs, I just don't understand you all.",

She was ranked at the bottom of the social stratification of a harem, serving not the man of the household, but rather, his concubines and wives as their personal chambermaid. Odal\u0131klar were usually slaves given as gifts to the sultan by wealthy Turkish men.\n\n&gt; If an odal\u0131k was of extraordinary beauty or had exceptional talents in dancing or singing, she would be trained as a possible concubine. If selected, an odal\u0131k trained as a court lady would serve the sultan sexually and only after such sexual contact would she change in status, becoming thenceforth one of the consorts of the sultan.\n\n\n\n&gt; In popular use, the word odalisque also may refer to a mistress, concubine or paramour of a wealthy man. \n\n&gt; During the 19th century, odalisques became common fantasy figures in the artistic movement known as Orientalism, being featured in many erotic paintings from that era.\n\n&gt; In 2011, the Law Society of British Columbia brought a disciplinary hearing against an unnamed lawyer for referring to another lawyer's client as living with an odalisque. The Law Society found that the word's use, though an extremely poor choice, did not rise to the level of professional misconduct.",

The vast majority of chief consorts (Haseki Sultan) were all white harem slaves abducted from Eastern Europe as children.\n\nThat's why many sultans looked like [ginger Sultan Selim II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selim_II) or was as pale as [Mehmed III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_III).  Even the last ever sultan, [Mehmed VI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_VI)'s harem was solely compoaed of Abhkazians, Circassians, and Albanians - in other words all Caucasians.

That's been the consensus in the field of 19th c art history since at least the 70s when Said published a book on the subject. Ingres never even traveled to the Middle East and is known for painting imaginative, not accurate, interpretations of things he read about the Middle East. He's also known for painting Western European looking women in Orientalist contexts and for intentionally inaccurate depictions of female anatomy. If you want historical accuracy don't look at an Ingres painting.",

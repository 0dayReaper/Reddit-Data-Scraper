It could have lessened the economic and military impact the war had on Sweden if it had ended earlier. Ending the war earlier could also have granted Sweden more time to prepare for another defensive war with Russia and maybe secure alliances with other nations. But in the end no matter what, Sweden can't alone stand against the vastness of Russia and the overwhelming population compared to Sweden.",

Many did rely heavily on luck, but then again, war is all about taking the right risks. He got too ambitious in Russia, but even Napoleon tried and failed to invade Russia. It's easy to see his mistakes when we know history, but with the limited information of the time it's another matter.",

There are two versions of the painting, the original painted in 1878 och a copy painted in 1884. The one depicted here is the original.",

This was the culmination of Charles XII Norwegian campaign. \n\nHe split his army in two parts, a southern and northern one. The southern one made slow and tedious progress because of Dano-Norwegian naval dominance, and the need to be resupplied by land. As they sieged the Fredriksten fortress in Halden (then Fredrikshald) the Swedish king was killed while scouting (most likely by a Norwegian sniper, but there are also theories of friendly fire).\n\nThe Northern army crossed into Tr\u00f8ndelag and was initially successful, but because of fierce local resistance failed to gain a proper foothold. When the message was relayed of the Kings death they decided to retreat back to Sweden. The army was caught in a blizzard as they crossed the Tydal mountains (this was december-january). Half of the 6000 strong army froze to death in the mountains, while 3/4ths of the remaining either died on the other side or were crippled for life.",

Very funny at times, too.\n\nAnyway, re: stomach issues, Napoleon seems rather conclusively to have died of stomach cancer, despite talk of poisonings and other things; the postmortem on Saint Helena showed pretty gruesome damage it had done to the inside of his stomach and adjacent organs-- one of the doctors present described a huge black blob of solidified blood or something like that in, I think, the stomach wall. We're just talking really, really obvious internal problems. So \"stomach issues\" at least eventually killed him, unfortunately (if one is of the disposition to like Napoleon; or fortunately otherwise).\n\nOn the day of *Waterloo,* though, apart from generally being exhausted and a bit out of shape, there's evidence that he may have had a horrible hemorrhoid flareup. \n\nThat was only one of the issues, though; he was sleep deprived, and regardless, Waterloo was a desperate situation for Napoleon from almost every angle. Even if he'd won, it would've been hard for him to beat the succeeding waves of reinforcements. The whole of Old Regime Europe was out for his blood. \n\nTerribly interesting story. Cool guy, Napoleon. Shame about all the death and destruction from his wars.",

This is because wet ground would dampen the effect of their canons, which the French had in more numbers than the allied forces (canon balls can bounce on dry ground and achieve much more destructive potential than on wet ground where they would simply bury themselves into the mud).",

Beside you is a half eaten ham sandwich and a precariously balanced wine glass filled with orange juice, which you don't keep in the house.

Little did they know you were ready for them.  There are no less than seven cheese and bean burritos cooling in the back of the fridge.  The vicious cycle continues.",

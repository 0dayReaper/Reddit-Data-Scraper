Their famous matrimonial policy was the whole reason why all the other major houses were related to them. They maxed out that path by the end of the 1500s and were careful to make sure other families can't use their tactic against them.\n\nIt was three specific marriages over three successive generations that changed the course of history and made the Habsburgs the most powerful dynasty in Europe. First the Burgundian Marriage of Maximilian I and Mary of Burgundy, the richest heiress in Europe, which gave the Habsburgs a massive cash infusion and land in Western Europe. Then the Spanish Marriage between Maximilian's son Philip and Joan of Castille and Aragon, this gave them control over Spain and its new colonies. Then the Jagiello Double Wedding of 1515 which was a masterstroke orchestrated again by Maximilian involving his grandchildren. Maximilian brokered a deal with the King Ladislaus of Hungary back in 1506 in which he betrothed his granddaughter Mary to the king's son Louis and his grandson Ferdinand to the king's daughter Anna. When King Louis of Hungary died without a heir the Crown of Hungary passed to his brother-in-law Ferdinand, paving the way for Habsburg domination of Central and Eastern Europe.",

And those rules were only legitimized by tradition. \"We always did it that way\". Break the tradition, and you break your own legitimization.\n\nSecond, if you do try to change the rules of inheritance, you have a civil war on your hands with everyone who stands to lose from those changes. And with other people who will claim that those new inheritance rules should also apply retroactively if that would mean that they would benefit. And probably several more wars for generations to come, because some people will claim that the change of the inheritance rules didn't count and that they are still entitled to some lands they would get under the old rules.",

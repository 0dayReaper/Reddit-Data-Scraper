I am certainly open to correction. But it made me think of the story, and everyone should have a chance to hear some 1001 nights anyway",

Then Sheherezade, the vizier's daughter (the same guy who's been the royal supplier for noble virgins for the king) decides to marry him.\n\nWhen in her chambers, her younger sister comes to say goodbye and asks her to tell her favourite story one last time. She only tells half the story, and then stops, claiming that it's already dawn.\n\nKing let's her live another day to finish the story. But the next night she finishes it and started another (by mentioning a few details of it and the king asking for the full story). Same shit happens for 1001 nights.\n\nBut the lady got only a 1000 stories. The king decides she's trustworthy in the end and does not kill her (the fact they got 3 kids together by then might have had something to do with it).\n\nMeanwhile, the king's brother seeing that his SIL cheated on his big bro, goes back to his kingdom and starts the same shit. But when Sheherezade finish her story, the king calls his little brother and says: Hey bro, turns out not al girls cheat. Then little bro says 'kay bro and marries Sheherezade's little sister.\n\nAnd that's the story of Sheherezade, inventor of the audiobook, the movie trailer and the cliffhanger and Middle East's first marital counsellor (though the practice of marrying to customer has,  in time, fallen into disuse).\n\nAnd then the king and Sheherezade stopped sleeping through the day and got on a normal sleep schedule again.\n\nThe end. (Not Sheherezade's though, she lived.)",

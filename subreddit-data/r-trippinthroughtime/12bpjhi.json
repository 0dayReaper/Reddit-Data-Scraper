When it comes to say the situation with Polyxena, I will be on her side forever flying a \"f*** Achilles, and not in the way he wants it\" banner-- but I have a soft spot for his reaction to Patroclus running off and doing a dumb in his armor... \n\nHonestly I think I get more from the \"try to raise him from the dead and it fails and he has to realize that some consequences don't fix and trying only hurts those around you\" theme than the road trip one, but you know. I'm kind of morbid and creepifying like that. Honestly if one went with the On The Road clone there is a lesson or 50 in there if you read the original to take on. It definitely wouldn't be a replica of the Illiad where Achilles' inflated ego is glorified as peak manhood and everyone else has to pay the consequences for his actions without him understanding that... \n\nBut what is fanfic other than seeing others' characters you feel are neglected in a direction and taking them in that direction?\n\nI mean, other than the plotless butt stuff. Which okay, is most of fanfic still, probably. It's been awhile since I've been to those kind of sites, I built up my own army of original characters in my head so I don't really have the need to borrow.",

It's so damn dry, Not one character has any actual depth or any emotion asides for selfish asshole, it's Wildy frantic without moving the story along at a pace faster than a glacier. It's honestly hard to follow with how often names with their full titles and locations are thrown out rapid fire at near random, it's all over the place all the time with characters and story locations. \"A catalog of ships\" .\n\nIt took me 4 attempts to get through it\n\nCredit where credits due, the fact Homer could recite it from memory (iirc) is beyond impressive, and if I had more than a passing interest in Greek mythology I'd probably not dislike as much",

It is my firm belief that just because something is a classic or widely regarded doesn\u2019t mean everyone has to like it, think highly of it, or force themselves to analyze it.\n\nSome stuff is just a slog and the payoff is too low. Especially if you have no interest in the topic at hand.",

That is why there are so many recurring sentences and sentence structures, to make it easier to remember. The storytellers would be accompanied by music and they told it in a rhythmic manner.\n\nThose kind of storytellers were called *rhapsoidoi*, which is where the words rhapsody and rap came from.",

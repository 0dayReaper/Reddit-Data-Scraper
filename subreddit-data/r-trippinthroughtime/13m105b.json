It shows the famous charge of the Royal North Dragoons (also called the The Scots Greys) at the Battle of Waterloo (1815) in which Napolean's forces were defeated by an allied coalition opposing the French. Here's the wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_Forever!) about the painting, and here's a high resolution version of the [image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Scotland_Forever%21.jpg).",

Just like the joke above, Keegan points out that not only are the horses too close together, they're all on a collision course destined to wreck at the foot of you, the viewer (or painter).",

On top of that, it\u2018s probably meant to leave an impression. One you wouldn\u2018t get as much when you either only show a couple of soldiers or a bunch of tiny ones to fit them all on the canvas. \n\nDramatization is a tool often used in arts.",

It was based on the Roman Republican model which influenced a lot of Enlightenment era revolutionaries.",

But again, I reiterate, I can't think of another country where such openly racist attacks happen with such blatant frequency. I did not intend to imply that \"mild\" racism doesn't matter, it certainly does and shouldn't exist either. Simply that it's not quite so...wild west, I suppose. That's why I used 'mild' instead of 'minor'. Poor choice on my part.\n\nI'm sorry.",

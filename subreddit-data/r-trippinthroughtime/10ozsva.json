The staffing shortages existed long before covid, and vet techs have one of the highest burnout rates of any profession. Veterinarians also have one of the highest rates of suicide out of any profession, and their pay sucks for the first few years out of school (in addition to the hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt that most of them graduate with). \n\nIt's not a matter of available clinics - every one of them in my area is hiring.  They just don't want to pay more than ~$16/hr and there is zero upward mobility. As someone who is now 30, that's not great. I am \"lucky\" enough to work for state-run veterinary teaching hospital (i.e. university) so my pay is higher than average ($20/hr), but there are a lot of problems here as well that I won't get into. Regardless, the cost of living is so high that I don't feel like I'm making much more than I did at 18, despite making over double what I did back then. Still can't afford a house, surprise medical expenses, etc. Life just sucks.",

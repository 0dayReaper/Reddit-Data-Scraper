To medieval people, it seemed like the rabbits were giving birth without having been inseminated, so they thought that rabbits could have virgin births. As such, they became associated with virginity and Mary's conception of Jesus in particular. Jesus was thought to have been conceived the same day he was crucified(3 days before Easter) , and so rabbits got eventually got associated with Easter itself .  \n\nEggs were forbidden during lent, but your hens would keep laying them and they kept longer than most other lent-prohibited food. so oftentimes,  the first thing people ate to break their lent fast was some of the eggs they already had gathered. Since the end of lent was Easter, eggs started to become associated with Easter.\n\n Later, German protestants combined the two and  started telling their kids that a rabbit would bring eggs and other goodies on Easter if they behaved. Eggs made of chocolate is a pretty natural extension of that.",

When you argue with someone you have to understand what your goal is and how you achieve it. It also helps to be relatable and know how to present things in a simple way that most people can understand. You also have to know when to let stupid people beat themselves and know not to ever interrupt someone who's making a mistake. When you're \"discussing\" something with someone in public your body language and facial expressions play a huge role too.

It works, especially against people who don't know how to debate.\n\nYou're basing your whole opinion of this guy on some dumb comments, attacking his character in the process, which doesn't exactly make you look good when he just said something stupid. If I were meaner, I'd say something equally as dumb and wait for you to attack me, then make you look mean and un-sportsmanlike, which would change how people view you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nListen, it doesn't matter how right you are, you're now falling into the same trap this post talked about.

It may become a lifetime project to remove alll the little things that stop (namely your ego in this example) you from being thankful.\n\nIn general the perfection of human qualities by these mystics is done through service. Again, it's a lot of service.\n\nThe mysticism is sometimes just a drop of sugar to help you affirm you are doing the right thing. Cause your ego doesn't like to serve and will make billions of excuses including 'why am I in this cult'.\n\nBut I can tell you now from experience. To help others is good even if you don't like it. To respect others before putting yourself first is good.\n\n7 years ago I was incredibly selfish and entitled. Now I am only slightly less so. I feel a million times better.",

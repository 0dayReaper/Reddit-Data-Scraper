Average backyard/barnyard flocks often have roosters too, so their eggs might be fertilized. Most will be eaten soon after laying tho, well before the chick is recognizably developed, unless the people want to grow their flock. Candling is how to tell fertilized from un; hold the egg up to a light in a dark/dim room. By four days after laying, if fertilized you'd see some blood vessel development.",

It's part of the broader movement of Art Nouveau.\n\nGaud\u00ed's architectural style is very distinctive but his use of ruled geometrical shapes like paraboloids, hyperboloids, and helicods was very modern. A lot of his techniques were cutting edge stuff that he pioneered in the 1910s and 1920s. He used a lot of building materials that were new at the time.\n\nHe was going for a look that was totally modern while also building on the Gothic tradition. If you look at the Sagrada Familia, it's a lot more three dimensional and organic-looking than traditional Gothic cathedrals but it has buttresses and arches and towers in that tradition. His work was very unique and very eclectic, he aimed to combine the old and the new in novel yet seamless way.",

Guadi was a stauch Christian and Picasso was a young idealist with a magazine.\n\nGuadi's meal of choice would be lettuce with oil, Picasso's was several women.  Both madters of their craft. The fate of Catalonia is what caused the schism.  Very political times in Spain. Civil war and general political unrest arose due to the faltering economy and preservation of the church over its people.  \n\n\n\n8 pages, 1 source, and I got a 95.   Darn tootin, best paper Ive ever written.",

Maybe something like Finnegans Wake by James Joyce.\n  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnegans_Wake\n\n&gt;Finnegans Wake is a book by Irish writer James Joyce. It has been called \"a work of fiction which combines a body of fables ... with the work of analysis and deconstruction\".[1]:210\u2013211 It is significant for its experimental style and reputation as one of the most difficult works in the Western canon.[2] Written in Paris over a period of seventeen years and published in 1939, Finnegans Wake was Joyce's final work. The entire book is written in a largely idiosyncratic language, which blends standard English lexical items and neologistic multilingual puns and portmanteau words to unique effect. Many critics believe the technique was Joyce's attempt to recreate the experience of sleep and dreams.[3] Owing to the work's linguistic experiments, stream of consciousness writing style, literary allusions, free dream associations, and abandonment of narrative conventions, Finnegans Wake remains largely unread by the general public.[4][5]\n  \nThe book starts mid-sentence. I've heard it described as an endless loop, a dream of the main character happening over and over again. It's a trippy book.",

I know opinions are like assholes and all that but hear me out\n\nThe one on the left is a technically good portrait, but it\u2019s kinda boring. To achieve realism in art is an incredible feat, sure, but I just find it so...lackluster - personally. The middle one is an artist discovering his own style outside of the confines of realistic portraiture, and the one on the right is an artist fully established in his own personal style. The one on the right is how the artist expresses himself best, how the art flows from him naturally and feels like passion and emotion and a life well lived. \n\nI\u2019m not a professional artist or even a good one, but when I first started I was so obsessed with trying to make everything look as \u201creal\u201d as I could. I couldn\u2019t seem to advance much or get what was in my head onto paper because I was so intent on it being this one particular box of art. Then I went to the Chicago art institute and saw stuff in person that was just so awe inspiring and life changing - and ever since then I just kinda draw and paint what I feel, I\u2019ve focused more on developing my own personal style and advancing my skill within those confines instead of trying to be Da Vinci.",

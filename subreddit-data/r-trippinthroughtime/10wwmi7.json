Instead of being cut in triangular slices, they are presented in thin strips, or \"fingers\". Instead of the traditional tomato sauce and toppings of a pizza, garlic fingers consist of pizza dough topped with garlic butter, parsley, and cheese, which is cooked until the cheese is melted. Bacon bits are also sometimes added.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/trippinthroughtime/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

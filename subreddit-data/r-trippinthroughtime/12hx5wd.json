I had imagined a nap sack hanging off the back, but there is that spur that comes off at a 90 angle just in front of his throat.  That wouldn't be typical of a walking stick, it's too big to be a night stick so I'd guess it's some kind of agricultural implement.\n\n...and yes I realise I am thinking to deeply about this.\n....And yes I am neuro divergent.",

Handle is typical sword handle. \n\nThere is a reflection on the blade on right, as well. \n\nAnd because i am as anal as u are, i googled the image. \n\nThe funniest part painting is literally called **David with his sword**\n\nP.S. reddit is 80% neurodivergents, who cares. U do not need to explain yourself to anyone and your way of communicating. Those that wanna be offended or ridicule u, will always find a way regardless of how autistic u perform. No need to label yourself in order to have excuse of being weird either. Own it.\n\nAdditionally, sometimes art is just bad, and even painter does not remember what they meant to draw.",

It is defo a sword, according to the Getty - the artist deliberately painted a slack jawed young King David carrying a sword too big for him.  It was part of series of old testament heroes.

In reality some things are not \u201csymbolising sadness\u201d, but extremely trivial explanation like \u201cthere was an empty space\u201d. I am a long time artist, stuff art critics etc come up with can be truly hilarious. Artists and their styles are too romanticised, they were more practical and also flamboyant to experiment, imo.

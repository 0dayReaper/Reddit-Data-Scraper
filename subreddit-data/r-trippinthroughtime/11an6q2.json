I found some metal thing with a spring under the seat in front of me (where my grandma was sitting) and started pulling on it with my foot out of boredom. It was squeaky, so after a while my grandpa stopped the car because it was making a weird noise. Naturally, since I got curious, I stopped moving the thing and the noise stopped.

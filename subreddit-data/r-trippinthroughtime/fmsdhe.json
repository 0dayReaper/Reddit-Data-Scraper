When you are dreaming, details are extremely fuzzy. You can't really focus in on anything without the illusion crumbling. I think that's where this painting succeeds, it contains just enough detail to trigger schemata recognition in the brain, yet provides very little to extrapolate on it and make it something too particular to be a dream.",

Unlike other artists that painted out of pain and struggle, Hopper painted through sheer observation of American life. Many of his paintings involve civilization encountering nature, and where that line is exactly. So many of his works are beautifully surreal and dream like to invoke such a deep sense of longing. Absolutely one of the most amazing American artists to have lived.",

Meaning you have everything the city has to offer - a variety of restaurants but the wait/delivery time is quicker and the food is better because it isn't rushed. Clubs that still have enough people around to make it fun but not so many your'e squashed up against everyone else. Less traffic and pollution from said traffic.

                    "comment": "The painter - Artemisia Gentileschi - has a cool story from a time when women had a hard time being a painter.\n\nSome excerpts from her very cool [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_Gentileschi) - \"Her achievements as an artist were long overshadowed by the story of\u00a0Agostino Tassi\u00a0raping her when she was a young woman and Gentileschi being tortured to give evidence during his trial. For many years Gentileschi was regarded as a curiosity, but her life and art have been reexamined by scholars in the 20th and 21st centuries. She is now regarded as one of the most progressive and expressive painters of her generation\"\n\n\"In an era when women had few opportunities to pursue artistic training or work as professional artists, Gentileschi was the first woman to become a member of the\u00a0Accademia di Arte del Disegno\u00a0in\u00a0Florence\u00a0and she had an international clientele.\"\n\n\"Many of Gentileschi's paintings feature women from myths, allegories, and the Bible, including victims, suicides, and warriors.\"\n\n\"Roberto Longhi, an Italian critic, described Artemisia as \"the only woman in Italy who ever knew about painting, coloring, drawing, and other fundamentals\". Longhi also wrote of\u00a0Judith Slaying Holofernes: \"There are about fifty-seven works by Artemisia Gentileschi and 94% (forty-nine works) feature women as protagonists or equal to men\"\n\n\"These characters intentionally lacked the stereotypical \"feminine\" traits\u2014sensitivity, timidness, and weakness\u2014and were courageous, rebellious, and powerful personalities\"\n\n\"A nineteenth-century critic commented on Artemisia's\u00a0Magdalene\u00a0stating, \"no one would have imagined that it was the work of a woman. The brush work was bold and certain, and there was no sign of timidness\".[44]\u00a0In\u00a0Raymond Ward Bissell's view, she was well aware of how women and female artists were viewed by men, explaining why her works were so bold and defiant in the beginning of her career.\n\nLonghi wrote:\n\nWho could think in fact that over a sheet so candid, a so brutal and terrible massacre could happen [...] but\u2014it's natural to say\u2014this is a terrible woman! A woman painted all this?\u00a0... there's nothing sadistic here, instead what strikes the most is the impassibility of the painter, who was even able to notice how the blood, spurting with violence, can decorate with two drops the central spurt! Incredible I tell you! And also please give Mrs. Schiattesi\u2014the conjugal name of Artemisia\u2014the chance to choose the hilt of the sword! At last don't you think that the only aim of Giuditta is to move away to avoid the blood which could stain her dress? We think anyway that that is a dress of Casa Gentileschi, the finest wardrobe in Europe during 1600, after\u00a0Van Dyck.\"\n\n\"Because Artemisia returned again and again to violent subject matter such as\u00a0Judith and Holofernes, a repressed-vengeance theory has been postulated by some art historians,[49]\u00a0but other art historians suggest that she was shrewdly taking advantage of her fame from the rape trial to cater to a niche market in sexually charged, female-dominated art for male patrons.\"",

The singular beauty of this rising star of the French theatre did not fail to move the Parisian critics, who either deplored or admired the slender, sinuous figure painted by Clairin.\n\nThe 32-year-old actress was enjoying her first triumphs in the plays of Racine and Hugo at the time. As a sign of her social ascent, she had just moved into her new mansion near to Monceau Park, the bohemian splendour of which is depicted in this painting.This large portrait showing the subject in a white satin dress, with a very studied nonchalance, was one of Sarah Bernhardt\u2019s favourites and she kept it all her life.\n\nIn 1876 it heralded the Art Nouveau aesthetic, with its sinuous lines, pearlescent tones and the magnetism of a feminine presence that is both seductive and disquieting. When his mother died, Maurice Bernhardt donated it to the Petit Palais, where it keeps the myth of this great actress alive.\n\n[Check out the painting in extremely high definition.](https://sc22c0t4k8s822o5229171931fbb682a2.s3.amazonaws.com/web/index.html?js=22w696d31247322488736727d9a9166/a22w450m54812d324480876838d13cf_fr.json)",

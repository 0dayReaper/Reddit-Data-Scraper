Using emojis is frowned upon here on this great site, and for good reason. Instagram normies often use them, and you don\u2019t want to be a normie, do you?\n\nIf I catch you using an emoji in the future, I\u2019ll be forced to issue a downvote to your comment. Why should you care, you may ask? Well to begin, you will lose karma on your account, which is a useful social status tool and also a way to show others you know your way around Reddit.\n\nIf you were to continue the use of emojis, I would be forced to privately message you about your slip-up. Any further offenses past that would leave me no other option than to report your account. I don\u2019t think I have to explain why you don\u2019t want that.\n\nBut anyways, no harm done yet! Follow these simple rules and you\u2019ll enjoy your future on Reddit! Have a blessed (and hopefully emoji-free) day, stranger.",

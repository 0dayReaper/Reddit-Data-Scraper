I find their art absolutely charming.\n\nIn this one I especially like how the artist has depicted what I assume are stars in the night-sky background. I also like the attention to detail on the shields, the dudes who are just sort of chilling in the arrow slits under the parapets, and the fire or whatever it is steaming up from the open door.\n\nAt the same time, I don\u2019t know what it is about this style of art, but the way people are drawn just makes them look so smelly to me somehow. Like they all have a kind of unwashed dirty clothes smell, an odor that makes you feel sad rather than repulsed. Which perhaps they did. But how do you convey that in an artwork? I hope someday science can rediscover this ancient technique that now is lost to time.",

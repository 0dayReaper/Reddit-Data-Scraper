Last chapter in revelations literally says if someone adds or takes away from The Bible their life will be taken out of the Book of Life and they will go to hell, okay 3. Why are so many ppl so flipping gullible, these paintings all have so many red flags it's disgusting. They look like real what irl a witch and warlock looks like, go look up like freemasonry and their attire on the job and the ridiculous stuff they wear.",

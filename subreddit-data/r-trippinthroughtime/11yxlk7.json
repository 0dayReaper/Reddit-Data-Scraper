The only people who ever ask for it are the expensive car owners, and the only people who really supply it are the dealerships. \n\nThey say it's supposed to stop the air pressure from fluctuating when it goes from hot to cold, but most shops don't have anything more than an air compresser because the alternative is super expensive to purchase and maintain and generally not worth the cost.\n\nThe rich guy on the horse is the fancy car driver and the lady with the cows is the shop owner. And is expecting 5 star service at a random farm.\n\nThe second part is that cows fart a lot",

The air we breathe is 78.9% nitrogen, 20.9% Oxygen, 0.1% Argon, and everything else including CO2 is in that last 0.1%. they're basically paying extra just to have the oxygen removed.",

This also makes the slip out of the rubber sealing much less, so the tire holds air more reliably. But tires filled with regular air don\u2019t really deflate quickly so I see no point in filling tires with nitrogen, unless it\u2019s a race car where temperatures affect performance a lot.",

That 8 picometer difference will add up over time, but you're only replacing 1/5 of the volume of a tire with the larger molecules. It ends up being a 2.6% difference for the volume being replaced but a 0.56% difference over the entire volume of the tire. Even in special applications it still sounds pretty gimmicky to me.",

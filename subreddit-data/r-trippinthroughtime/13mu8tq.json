Be right back I'm going to have to dig into some etymology.\n\n\"The Old Tar term comes from the early days of the Navy when sailors often boarded enemy ships in battle and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Beforehand, they would dip the knot of their long hair in tar, which would then harden and protect their necks from blows from behind. Some sailors soon became known as \"tars.\u201d An \"Old Tar\" was one who was honored and respected for his knowledge, wisdom and long experience at sea.\"\n\nCool! You learn something new every day. And it's not always about mermaid or porpoise sex!",

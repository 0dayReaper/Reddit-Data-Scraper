Ha-ha. You shouldn't be here, y'know.\"\n\n\"I told you, sir, I can run Goop and work for you just fine. I'm an excellent time manager.\"\n\n\"That's not what I mean, Pepper.\" Mickey said, his voice taking a grim tone.\n\nPepper Potts became deeply silent.\n\nPepper had known this game of his for far too long to find it funny.\n\nMickey's sterner tone would reveal itself in moments of distress, moments when Mickey was forced to reflect on what must be done.\n\nA moment later, his famous smile would return to him and he'd change the subject.\n\nEach time, especially in the last year, it took longer and longer for him to drop what he called an act and it felt more and more transparent every day.\n\nWhat felt like a full minute later, Mickey's smile did, eventually, return.\n\n\"I got your candle, Pepper.\"\n\nFor the first time, Mrs. Potts did not return the smile. \n\nMickey knew his time was up.\n\n\"Do you\u2026 ha-ha, do you remember, Pepper?\" Mickey was using her name a lot today. For how eloquent Micholas was, this was akin to a stammer or a loss of self. \"Do you remember that day?\"\n\n\"Like it was yesterday, Mickey.\"\n\n\"It feels like yesterday, doesn't it? It feels like a week ago at most, ha-ha. Gosh.\"\n\n\"Tell me the story again, Mickey.\"\n\n\"Of course, Pepper.\"\n\nMickey moved to shut the curtains behind him.\n\nHe couldn't bring himself to do it.\n\nHe couldn't turn a blind eye to the chaos of the outside world.\n\nHe couldn't rid himself of the responsibility that welled up in his heart when he heard even the most distant attack of a coronadaemon, and the accompanying screams that it brought.\n\nMickey turned himself back around, light still blaring against his backside.\n\nHe sat, slowly.\n\n\"Old Jiminy Cricket came back from one of his adventures. To the future\u2026 this time. It wasn't often that ol' Jim went where he hadn't been before, ha-ha. This time he went a little far. Decided you and I were the best people to tell about the coronavirus. I remember, we were working on Treasure Planet then\u2026\"\n\nMickey exhaled, long and deeply.\n\n\"Don't torture yourself, Micholas.\" Pepper reminded him.\n\n\"I'm not. Ever since that day, when he told us about the coming of the Grand Coronadaemon, I've spent a lifetime of hard decisions. You remember what we did when we found out, Pepper?\"\n\n\"Tell me again.\"\n\n\"We, ha-ha, we decided that if we were going to be the heroes we told stories about, it wasn't going to be fun and it wasn't going to be glamorous.\"\n\nMickey stood up again, pouring himself a glass of scotch, served with ice from a melting ice bucket.\n\n\"No more making art, we said. We had our chance. Now was the time to do something important. We had to prepare art for the coming storm\u2026 if it was ever going to survive.\"\n\nPepper looked at the floor solemnly. \"Jiminy said that humanity would survive this mess, Mickey.\"\n\n\"But we didn't know if its art would, Pepper. So we decided to be art's protectors. To gather it all into one place, a fortress of steel and solitude and more money than had ever been gathered in the world. And do you know why, Pepper?\"\n\nMickey sighed again. \"Because old man Walt's company was never going to make it. Not through this. Not you. Not me. If he couldn't do it, then who could? Warner Brothers? Don't make me laugh. And now it's just about time. We've held out through the first six years of the coronavirus. If Cricket's correct, with zero income, Disney should fall right as the exponential arrival of the coronalords cuts out. We did it, Pepper.\"\n\n\"We did?\"\n\n\"We did it. By appealing to the lowest common demoninator, by crushing heart after heart and turning art into a commodity\u2026 we gave our legacy every resource it needed to be safe and return to the hands of the people, instead of being scattered to the winds in the unprepared hands of Fox and Sony. God, ha-ha, Sony didn't even make it a year into this mess! Imagine if we hadn't helped them as much as we did! And where would their IPs be now, Pepper?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Mickey\u2026 but couldn't we have-\"\n\n\"No, Pepper. It had to be garbage. Every last film. We didn't just need money, Pepper, we needed every last dime we could get our hands on. Every Moana and Ant-Man and all of those insipid remakes\u2026 no one could be allowed to miss them when they're gone. I've explained this to you before, Pepper.\"\n\n\"You're right, Mickey. I know. I just wish-\"\n\nPepper's voice was interrupted by the increasingly garbled voice from his assistant Demetri on Mickey's security intercom.\n\n\"Sir! Mr. Mouse! A coronataur is climbing the walls to your office! You've got to get out of there!\"\n\n\"You betcha, Demetri.\" Mickey spoke into the intercom, not moving an inch.\n\n\"Mickey?\"\n\n\"You'd better get out of here, Pepper. Get somewhere safe. Protect Goop. When this all blows over, you need to get medicine to every last man, woman and child in the wake of this nightmare. And you've got to do it Goop style.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do, Mickey?\"\n\n\"When I'm gone, our stock prices are going to plummet. That's okay. We don't need the shareholders anymore. Just focus on your medicine.\"\n\n\"\u2026Sir\u2026\"\n\n\"Go, Pepper! The world\u2026 still needs you.\"\n\nPepper Potts walked around to the other side of Mickey's desk.\n\nMickey and Pepper stared longingly into each other's eyes.\n\n\"If only we could have had more time.\" Pepper spoke softly.\n\n\"It wasn't our destiny, my love. Ha-ha.\"\n\nOne last kiss.\n\nPepper Potts' human lips pressed awkwardly but sweetly against Mickey's large mouse lips.\n\nIn an embrace that came just shy of holding a lifetime's worth of desires, regrets and missed moments, Pepper Potts and Mickey Mouse kissed each other one last time.\n\n\"Goodbye, Mickey.\"\n\n\"Goodbye, darling.\"\n\nOnce again, the clacking of shoes against hardwood.\n\nOr was that the sound of coronataur feet scaling the building?\n\nDid it really matter?\n\nMickey guessed not.\n\nMickey would soon be feeling the strange fingered hoofs of the coronataur squeezing against his neck.\n\nBut the art would be okay.\n\nThe coronataur would grab at the broken glass with its many arms and rip Mickey Mouse to shreds.\n\nBut Snow White would survive.\n\nThe coronataur gripped Mickey Mouse by the jaw, ripping and ripping until Mickey Mouse felt air beneath the skin on the back of his head.\n\nBut Mulan would see the sun another day.\n\nAladdin and the Lion King.\n\nBeauty And The Beast.\n\nMickey Mouse felt his life slip away at the hands of the coronavirus.\n\nThe brown, dusty, setting sun was the last thing he saw.\n\nBut the art survived.",

Like to some degree I just choose to ignore the conspiracy theorists, because I think it's also a manifestation of mental issues of those people.\n\nBut what gets me is these 'I didn't think it through but let me be loud about my selfish opinion'. The concern with the virus is not exactly the mortality rate alone, but also how infectious it is, an done of the biggest aspect of this is the long ass incubation period. By the time you may suspect you're sick, you had at average 5 days you could have spread it around. And fuck the mortality rate, because when it gets this infectious, even low mortality rate becomes a huge number.\n\nAnd the whole argument on economy is total bullshit, a perfect lockdown can theoretically end any Corona cases around 2 weeks. The less people take it seriously, the more the lockdown has to drag on. And hmm, who are the people who are not contributing a single thing to a swift lockdown? Oh but people must work? Then fuck you and put on a mask and keep distance so we can at least minimize the spread so we can get out of lockdowns faster. \n\nAnd bottom line is, the more infection the bigger chance of mutation that we can't keep track of. This pandemic is already going way further than it ever should have gotten because of these selfish fucks who cannot think beyond anything that gets shit out by their two neurons having an electric fart. \n\nSo these are hollow arguments to just enforce their selfishness, nothing to do with any intelligent argument or an attempt to fix any issues. They call all go fuck themselves.",

We have to become educated to become rational and to trust in science. Those who do not understand science have no reason to trust in it.  \n  \nI have spoken with people on the other side of this and honestly they have thought through their opinion *as far as they can*. We cannot know what we don't know, so it is impossible for them to perceive how wrong they are.  \n  \nBoth sides believe the other to be indoctrinated.  \n  \nA lot of the arguments covidiots make are certainly made with a bias to conveniently enable the behaviours they want to continue doing. But honestly the same is true with a lot of us. A harmless example of this would be: when we have to do dishes we will sometimes convince ourselves that \"they need to soak\" to put it off. That's just how we're wired. We do what gives us an advantage because it's evolutionarily successful.  \n  \nSo the most productive place to start would probably be at trust.  \n  \nTrust seems to be the biggest issue.  \n  \nAnd it's no coincidence that trust is also the reason why \"revolutions in education\" haven't ever taken off. We need a human teacher who we can look up to as a mentor. Who we can trust. That is how we learn as humans.  \n  \nIt's also no coincidence that misinformation spreads best on Facebook, because it's *your friends* who are sharing it. You trust those people, so you are more likely to believe what they share. And going against them would threaten your social acceptance. Something that's a *necessity* for humans.

Our contributions extend beyond what is visible to us. There's also the fact that outside influences (ala Russian bots, tech companies like Facebook, media companies like Fox News, basically various propaganda machines which have become very powerful and far reaching in the information age) stoke the flames.\n\nThinking that sharing memes will be what ultimately brings about the radicalization of these individuals is akin to believing an individual's carbon footprint makes a serious contribution to climate change when industry is contributing at a rate that would bring us there in nearly just as quick a time even if we could neutralize the carbon footprint of your average individual.\n\nI get doing your part and I think it's important if only to bring about a change in attitudes, but people don't need to be one-dimensional.

(prime minister Mark Rutte completely denied something he said at the start of the corona pandemic) \nI havent been able to properly go to school for about a year now, and its really annoying me. I have tests coming up and since the pandemic started, im having a hard time focussing on school.\nAnyhow, it all started the first few weeks of the pandemic (i believe it was March 2020, not entirely sure)\nPrime minister Mark Rutte said: '' We need to stay calm, wear masks, only go to where you need to go, dont make unnessecary road trips, and we must build group-immunity'' the pandemic was a setback, but there was still a lot of hope itd be alright..\nA few months later, prime minister Mark Rutte told us that we could all go back outside, as long as we keep the 1.5 meter distance from each other and wear masks in public places.\nFew months later, he told us that we needed to go back inside, we would do things the same way we did when the pandemic started. (this is also where he completely denied that he said we had to build group immunity)\nThis cycle has been going on for a while now, and it disappoints me, i dont know what the government is doing, but had they just put us in lockdown, investigated a bit further to what the virus is, and locked the borders (something they still havent done) we wouldve been alright.\nEverything seems a bit sloppy, and its hard to deal with this situation for a year, and still trusting in the government.\nWhen the new vaccine was developed i had faith that they might had actually done something, sadly there are many different stories aswell about the vaccines, one person says it is 90% safe, the other says 98%, and the other says 60%.\nWith so many different stories flying around your head, its hard to know what the truth is.\nAnd to strengthen this argument; there will and are a lot of people just saying: '' just believe the government, they are elected for a reason''. Yes, but they thought the exact same thing with for example Hitler. Hitler was part of the government and we all know how that went.\nThis is also part of the reason why ive become afraid of the vaccine, well, at least not sure to what it does and how.\nWe cant trust anyone in this world, thats what disappoints me the most. Now a days people are just trying to make money.\nIn China they have Apple phone factories where chinese people are trying to KILL themselves, so they try to jump out of the window. To prevent that the owners of these factories have made nets all over the building, which proves my point.\nMorale of the story: dont trust anyone, do your research. Im not making conclusions here, i just have NO idea wha tis going on and im very confused. Being confused is better than having a chance to believing the wrong thing.",

Chemtrails sound wild too right?  How about the multiple times the USAF sprayed zinc cadmium sulfide powder over Minneapolis, which was later connected to increased cancer rates in poor black neighborhoods.   Or the biological release from planes like the C-119 \"Flying Boxcar\"?  That all is real and documented.  MK ULTRA was when the CIA intentionally kidnapped and drugged American and Canadian citizens to test mind control experiments with LSD and other lost chemicals. \n\nOnce you learn about the straight up evil shit our government has done in the name of control, you would be skeptical of anything they tell you, too.\n\nA large number of conspiracy theories are true, but the evidence hasn't been found yet.",

After banning and doxing massive amounts of people big tech and the news is now saying the virus DID come from a lab. \n5. After lefties left it all out on the field burning this country to the ground for 10 months they couldn't even enjoy their victory lap because of a super duper deadly virus but then d.c. mayor bowser opened everything in d.c. five days after the inauguration.\n6. The youtube video of the inauguration was getting savaged so youtube deleted tens of thousands of downvotes. They workin OVERTIME for ya boy Joe \"pisspants\" Biden.\n7. Youtube also had to turn off the comments because the most popular \"president\" of all time is so loved every comment was blasting this fraudualant admin. \n8. Joe Bribin, after getting 80 gazillion, TOTALLY LEGITIMATE votes after criticizing President Trump over his handling of the WuFlu, saying \"he has no plan\" then went on to say recently \"there's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the virus in the coming months\"... Aka, he has no plan. \n9. Call Trump a \"fascist dictator\" then proceed to fortify d.c., bring in 30k troops and sign 40 Executive orders in his first two weeks. \n10. The fake news media who has been covering for Biden and putting a flamethrower on Trump for four straight years will now pretend that they didn't try to push the now admitted fake Russian Dossier on us....$50 million tax dollars later, multiple investigations, fake whistle blowers and NOTHING was discovered. No collision. Trump acquitted. \n11. News is fake, got receipts.\n12. Epstein didn't kill himself.\n\n**For those of you still dumb enough to use Google....

(Italy, Peru)\n\nThe rare person who critically thinks in, let\u2019s be honest, mostly blue states or on any big tech platform gets grouped together with the extreme conspiracies that think it\u2019s fake altogether. The trend the past year has been shaming, whether it be \u201csocial justice\u201d or coronavirus. Let\u2019s also disregard the fact that no evidence in sociology suggests shaming is a good method for changing behavior. What\u2019s so sad is that these people are afraid to have these discussions altogether. Not because they aren\u2019t informed. The discussion simply won\u2019t take place because they have to be right. Their morally superior world view could be challenged and discussion could reveal how infrequently they think for themselves. Better to just keep virtue signaling and discouraging discussion altogether. Best way? Shaming. \n\nMake no mistake people like OP and similar posters(likely bots) on this toxic website are trying to erase your ability to even think for yourself. No discussions allowed even if what you say is factually true. I don\u2019t see a bright future ahead for this country and that hurts to say. I suppose all empires have their peak. If what I said sounds like thoughts you\u2019ve had recently don\u2019t worry you aren\u2019t alone! Protect your thoughts, take things with a grain of salt and think critically.",

After all, we are social primates and things like trust, cooperation, and belief are natural instincts. All people tend to feel uncomfortable accepting they have trusted the wrong side in the past or admitting they were fooled (some pompous people claim they aren't, but i think you'd have to be pretty unusual to be an exception here). So what makes believing scientific and medical experts better in this case, and in particular experts with media attention in positions of power.\n\nThe difference is revising your opinion based on new information, and mental flexibility in the face of confusing new facts. If someone told me the stuff the cdc says is horseshit I'd ask where they heard that, why they think it, and if they presented a solid source that seemed equally credible I would be willing to revise my opinion. No one has, all the hoax stuff or masks don't work stuff is either really obvious click bait or doesn't present evidence, but rather just tries to use fallacies to discredit the experts. It's not about picking the right side first and believing it, it's more about willingness to try and wrangle unfamiliar situations while listening to many sources and rejecting claims lacking evidence.\n\nFinally, when two sides are directly opposed in a debate like this, it's good to think about what the parties stand to gain and lose if their claims are true/false. People are human, sometimes experts lie for their own benefit. Medical practitioners stand to gain nothing by forcing people to uselessly wear masks (especially masks which restrict breathing). The CDC stands to gain nothing and it's leader stands to gain nothing by asking businesses to follow certain standards. What do they lose if they're caught lying? A lying doctor will be fired and sued for millions (malpractice). A lying member of a government agency will lose their prestigious job in a high profile way that makes finding a new one hard. What does an online article or a YouTuber stand to gain by saying something false? Attention and therefore, money. What do they stand to lose if they are caught? Some side hustle making shit up online (possibly not even under their real name).  This doesn't mean doctors never lie or fringe articles online don't sometimes end up being the real deal: but if you're making a real effort to see what's what, it's easier to believe the side that stands to gain by being honest and stands to lose by lying, and harder to believe someone who can talk shit all day and night with no consequences.",

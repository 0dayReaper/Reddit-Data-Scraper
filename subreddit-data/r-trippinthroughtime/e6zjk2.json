It\u2019s less what the dream is \u201cabout\u201d and more the the dreamer can understand what it was attempting to tell them. Making a story from it is one of the best ways to understand its underlying message. Many dreams can be hodge-podgy and seem random or meaningless. But that\u2019s also in part of the recall ability of the dreamer.",

Those can *feel* terrifying. When you describe them you start to realize how fucking dumb it sounds and wonder why you were scared in the first place. Then think of someone listening to that story. I'm not saying all dreams aren't worth sharing, but most of them definitely don't deserve it.",

Long dream made short I was playing with my family in my back yard when a stampede of Dino\u2019s comes over the knoll, me and my grandpa hid in the garage but a t-Rex tore the wall down and ate him then me. Years later in real time he would ask me to ditch school and come help him work but I was behind in classes and figured I shouldn\u2019t, he died a non Dino related death later that day before I got the chance to see him. Though I do wonder if that dream was a warning of sorts, maybe the fear of losing him before I was ready? If that were the case, then I think it\u2019d make me pretty happy, cause as much as missing out on that last day with him sucked, I also took advantage of many opportunities to spend time with him in the years preceding his death, we were tight, he was my first mentor. Well damn... I didn\u2019t make this short at all and for that I apologize, but I\u2019m leaving it as it is just cuz I don\u2019t usually go on about this kinda stuff. There ya have it, dreams.",

But I was always walking out of the room at my house and my room was pitch black like tar and as I'd get further away from it it would grow and follow me. I would try to run down the hall but it would be long and I would be running in slow motion or like I weighed a million pounds. \n\nI would try to run up the stairs where it was light and sunny. But the shadowy tar would chase me up the stairs grab my leg and drag me down into the darkness. Then I'd wake up terrified.

But! There was something wrong with my baby! My baby\u2019s legs were too long and apparently it was a big deal. Anyway throughout the dream the sex of my baby changed several times and so did its name. And I kept remembering there was something wrong with my baby but couldn\u2019t remember what it was. But it was long baby leg syndrome I guess. I was really relieved when I woke up.",

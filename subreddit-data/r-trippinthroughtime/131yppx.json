            "comment": "Actual ancient acupuncture could be pretty brutal.\n\nThose fine, delicate needles they used today? You can't even make those with ancient techniques. They were big, almost knife and stake-like. They were used for procedures not so different from european bloodletting.\n\nThough to be fair, what counts as \"acupuncture\" is debatable. It's roots are pretty old (though probably not the \"3,000 years old\" that are normally claimed), but what we would recognize as acupuncture is significantly younger, from like the 16th century.\n\nSome fun quotes from [*De acupunctura*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4613749/), one of the first (1683) western writings on acupuncture (I think it coined the term), as it was practiced then:\n\n&gt;The needle must be inserted only superficially into the affected location\n\nOk, this doesn\u2019t sound so ba-\n\n&gt;with the following exceptions:\n\nOh, no.\n\n&gt;Certain ailments of the head which the needle is sometimes implanted into the skull itself; similarly,\ncertain uterine conditions for which the womb itself is occasionally\nperforated\n\nDamn.\n\n&gt;The Japanese\nemploy acupuncture especially for pains of the belly, stomach, and head\ncaused by winds, and for the initial stages of cataracts. They perforate those parts in order to permit the confined wind to exit (in the same way, sausages, when they threaten to explode in a heated pan, are\npierced to allow the expanding wind to go out). The same technique is\nuseful in tympanites or flatulent ascites, colic pain, etc.\n\nThanks for that lovely sausage image, Rhijne!\n\n&gt;Puncture the womb of a pregnant woman when the fetus moves excessively before the appropriate time for birth and causes the mother such\nsevere pains that she frequently is in danger of death; puncture the fetus\nitself with a long and sharp needle, so as to terrify it and make it cease its\nabnormal movement fraught with danger for the mother.\n\nWe've gone soft. Today, the mother feels pain and she asks for dumb things like \"pain killers.\" Weaklings. In the good old days, when a fetus got uppity, we just stabbed that fucker into submission.\n\nI like that, at the end of a long list of diseases where he puts \"swelling of the testicles\" (which is apparently very common in Japan at the time) and \"gonorrhea,\" he's very clear that \"for the conditions listed, acupuncture must be performed on that\npart of the body where the disease originates.\"\n\nAnd yes, I know modern medicine can be not pretty, too. But remember: this is being done with no antiseptic protocols and no scientific  method to prove this procedures are actually necessary, or even effective.",

But to me that's exactly what this piece does. It reads like it's just a snapshot from an everyday moment in his life where he was working as a carpenter, and maybe he's griping about something, or soneone that frustrated him in a very animated way. But in this moment he just happens to take the exact pose he would later take on the crucifix and his shadow cast on the wall with his tools, the things he would use to build, be it tables or ideals, representing his cross.\n\nI'm not a terribly religious person, but it's striking. And I can appreciate the context.",

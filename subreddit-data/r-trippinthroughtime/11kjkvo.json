All of which had a lot of bops on them, dynamite probably being my personal favourite for its slow bass-focused grooves.\n\nAfter that, they started veering towards disco house beats which weren't nearly as good as their acid jazz funk albums IMO. That said, almost every one of their albums has at least one really good song on it and are worth listening to.\n\nSome good more recent songs are: white knuckle ride, starchild, telullah and cloud 9.\n\nI'm not so sure if you haven't heard them since, you might\u2019ve just not recognised it. Their newest album automaton was the nr. 2 top selling dance/electronic album in the US in 2017. Their recent songs get played on radio relatively frequently.",

            "comment": "The Arnolfini Portrait (or The Arnolfini Wedding, The Arnolfini Marriage, the Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife, etc.) is a 1434 oil painting on oak panel by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. It forms a full-length double portrait, believed to depict the Italian merchant Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife, presumably in their residence at the Flemish city of Bruges.\n\nIt is considered one of the most original and complex paintings in Western art, because of its beauty, complex iconography, geometric orthogonal perspective, and expansion of the picture space with the use of a mirror. \n\nVan Eyck used the technique of applying several layers of thin translucent glazes to create a painting with an intensity of both tone and colour. The glowing colours also help to highlight the realism, and to show the material wealth and opulence of Arnolfini's world. Van Eyck took advantage of the longer drying time of oil paint, compared to tempera, to blend colours by painting wet-in-wet to achieve subtle variations in light and shade to heighten the illusion of three-dimensional forms. The wet-in-wet (wet-on-wet), technique, also known as alla prima, was highly utilized by Renaissance painters including Jan van Eyck. The medium of oil paint also permitted van Eyck to capture surface appearance and distinguish textures precisely. He also rendered the effects of both direct and diffuse light by showing the light from the window on the left reflected by various surfaces. It has been suggested that he used a magnifying glass in order to paint the minute details such as the individual highlights on each of the amber beads hanging beside the mirror.\n\nThe illusionism of the painting was remarkable for its time, in part for the rendering of detail, but particularly for the use of light to evoke space in an interior, for \"its utterly convincing depiction of a room, as well of the people who inhabit it\". Whatever meaning is given to the scene and its details, and there has been much debate on this, according to Craig Harbison the painting \"is the only fifteenth-century Northern panel to survive in which the artist's contemporaries are shown engaged in some sort of action in a contemporary interior. It is indeed tempting to call this the first genre painting \u2013 a painting of everyday life \u2013 of modern times\".\n\nDespite the restricted space, the painter has contrived to surround them with a host of symbols. To the left, the oranges placed on the low table and the windowsill are a reminder of an original innocence, of an age before sin. Unless, that is, they are not in fact oranges but apples (it is difficult to be certain), in which case they would represent the temptation of knowledge and the Fall. Above the couple's heads, the candle that has been left burning in broad daylight on one of the branches of an ornate copper chandelier can be interpreted as the nuptial flame, or as the eye of God. The small dog in the foreground is an emblem of fidelity and love. Meanwhile, the marriage bed with its bright red curtains evokes the physical act of love which, according to Christian doctrine, is an essential part of the perfect union of man and wife.\n\nAlthough all these different elements are highly charged with meaning, they are of secondary importance compared to the mirror, the focal point of the whole composition. It has often been noted that two tiny figures can be seen reflected in it, their image captured as they cross the threshold of the room. They are the painter himself and a young man, doubtless arriving to act as witnesses to the marriage. The essential point, however, is the fact that the convex mirror is able to absorb and reflect in a single image both the floor and the ceiling of the room, as well as the sky and the garden outside, both of which are otherwise barely visible through the side window. The mirror thus acts as a sort of hole in the texture of space. It sucks the entire visual world into itself, transforming it into a representation.\n\nThe painting is signed, inscribed and dated on the wall above the mirror: \"Johannes de eyck fuit hic 1434\" (\"Jan van Eyck was here 1434\").\n\nSources: \nhttps://wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnolfini_Portrait\n\nhttps://www.wga.hu/html_m/e/eyck_van/jan/15arnolf/15arnol.html\n\nHere is a video that discusses the various meanings of the painting and symbols within it:\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=wM6d9BOj4Ww",

(Also, good job, OP.) \n\nIt could be that she looks pregnant due to the style of dress, but also she may have been painted to reflect the beauty standards at the time. Many of the female nudes of the Early Northern Renaissance or Early Netherlandish painting were depicted with small, high breasts, an elongated torso, and a protruding belly. (Then again, maybe some of these women were actually built somewhat similar to that...? I don't know.)\n\n- NSFW - \n\nHere's a link to a Van Eyck depiction of Adam and Eve nude that shows the female body type described above: \n\n- NSFW -\n\n[https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/kooness-stage-bucket/uploads/archive/2_Jan_Van_Eyck_-_Adam_and_Eve.jpg](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/kooness-stage-bucket/uploads/archive/2_Jan_Van_Eyck_-_Adam_and_Eve.jpg)",

It's like taking a selfie on the beach in Hawai'i for your Insta feed and some scholar trying to say the image is symbolic of the fragility of life and the sunsetting of beautiful days as we grow old or some other b.s.",

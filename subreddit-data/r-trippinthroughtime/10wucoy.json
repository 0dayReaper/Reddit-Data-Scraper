I bet she was mystified why I didn\u2019t go for her.\n\nI only just found out recently she had a massive crush on the bday boy, who already had a gf. Before that I was so confused why she locked herself in the bathroom with him then hit on me. Now I get it, she was like me, crushing on more than one person just trying to figure out young life. But still, no, thank you. You were just very obviously giving my friend bday bj or sex. So if I can have any girl I want it\u2019s not you. Sorry not sorry.",

She said, \u201cHey handsome.\u201d I said, \u201cHello beautiful.\u201d And walked straight back to my room and went to bed.\n\nWhen I was young I was convinced that no one wanted me. If anyone showed any interest it had to be a joke. I was sure I was ugly and I didn\u2019t stand a chance.\n\nI got older and realized I was a fool.\n\nEverything worked out though. I\u2019m with the most beautiful person I\u2019ve ever seen or known. My friends were probably convinced I was 100% gay. I just had no confidence. If a man had took the time to hit on me I would have been sure it was a joke. \n\nSome of us aren\u2019t built for it. We have to find our way. \n\nI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t grow up with incel communities. They could have ruined me.",

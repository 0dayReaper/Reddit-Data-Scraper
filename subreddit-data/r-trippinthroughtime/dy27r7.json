Some royals actually had the doorways in their palaces widened to accommodate the panniers! \n\nBut it\u2019s also important to remember that most gowns never got anywhere near this wide, this style is an example of what would have been worn at court at the time, like an haute couture runway look of the day. Not practical, not representative of what people actually wore, but perfect to show off how much money you have or how important you are!",

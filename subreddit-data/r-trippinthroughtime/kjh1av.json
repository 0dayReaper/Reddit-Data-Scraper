                                                    "comment": "You had seen the way the crusader looked at you, but you could not be sure.\n\nThere were more important concerns.\n\nThe dead rising, the beasts of the wild, the starving refugees; these occupied your attention.\n\nIt was the merest vanity, regardless, to imagine that he could think of you that way.\n\nSuch distractions only served to hinder the Quest, he would doubtless say.\n\nStill, you could not stop yourself from considering it, in the long dark hours, alone in your bunk.\n\nYou muffled your cry of release in your pillow, imagining that it was his rough warrior\u2019s hand on your cock instead of your own, and swallowed the guilt afterwards.\n\nBut then \u2014\n\nYou were alone with him, slogging mile after miserable mile through the Blood Marsh, beset by all manner of hideous beasts, searching for the ancient way to Corvus. \n\nFor once, lust was the farthest thing from your mind; surviving the next hour, the next day, was everything.\n\n\u201cWe should return to the enclave and rest,\u201d you said. \u201cThis cursed cold mud has sapped the life from my bones.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe passed a cave not a quarter mile back,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps we can rest there a while. I\u2019m loath to leave the trail when we\u2019ve covered so much ground.\u201d\n\nThe cave was well enough - small, dry, and even warm once you got a little fire going.\n\nThe crusader prayed to the Avatars of his order, and they appeared, faintly shimmering spectral figures, to stand watch outside. \n\nThe crusader took off his armor and you took off your cloak and scarf, spreading them out to dry; when you looked up, his eyes were on you.\n\n\u201cI think this is the first time I\u2019ve seen your whole face,\u201d he said; nodding to your scarf, \u201cI wondered if you ever took that off.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly on grand high feast days and in muddy caves,\u201d you said, hoping your voice sounded light and breezy despite feeling like there was too much air in your chest.\n\nHe gave a little chuckle and dropped his gaze, and you could finally exhale.\n\nYou busied yourself with going through your pack for trail bread, doing your best to ignore the way his eyes kept flicking back to you.\n\nYou wondered if there were special punishments in Zakarum for seducing one of their Crusaders.\n\nHe took a swig from his wineskin, then passed it to you. \n\nIt was miserable stuff, only a half-step above vinegar, but it soothed your dry throat and you smiled your thanks as you passed it back to him.\n\n\u201cThis is a far cry more pleasant than some of the places I\u2019ve spent the night, out on the road,\u201d he said, gesturing to the cave around you. \u201cA roof and a fire are nothing to take for granted; let alone such agreeable company.\u201d\n\nA stronger man would have left that unanswered, or barked out a sharp rebuff; but as the ancient Horadrim fell to pride, it seemed, so would you. \n\nYou looked up to meet his eyes, and you noted the faintest flush in his cheeks and on his throat, and the way his gaze drifted to the open neck of your shirt.\n\n\u201cDid you\u2026 keep company often, out on the road?\u201d you asked, suddenly aware of every bright-hot nerve in your body.\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d he said, and his eyes were on your mouth, his voice breaking hoarse. \u201cIt is not forbidden, but distractions are\u2026 discouraged.\u201d\n\nYou thought of whips and red-hot irons deep inside of anuses like depicted in this meme, but these thoughts did nothing to dissuade you; if anything, the opposite. \u201cIs any respite from the war a distraction, then?\u201d\n\nHe considered for a few long moments before answering. \n\n\u201cI think not,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything, denying the needs of the flesh distracts the mind. One would not go without sleep for fear of losing focus in battle the next day, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWise words,\u201d you said, letting your own gaze wander to the breadth of his shoulders, the muscled planes of his chest.\n\nYou looked to his face, and there was a look of such restraint, heated desire matched by iron will, that you felt the briefest thrill of power; you held the stone to tip that scale, and it was intoxicating.\n\nSo you said, \u201cCome over here, sit on my cloak,\u201d and with a sudden fluid movement, he was beside you and his mouth was on yours.\n\nHe closed his eyes as he kissed you; you wrapped a hand around the back of his head, feeling the few days\u2019 growth of stubble there.\n\nHe was fever-warm, and his strong hands were careful on your side, on your jaw, as he guided you to straddle his lap.\n\nThe laces of his jerkin were stubborn but your hands were nimble, and he groaned when your fingers brushed his throat.\n\nYou thought, for a moment, of him on his knees before you, hands bound behind his back, his mouth on you; the thought was almost too much, and you rolled your hips into him, holding back a moan of your own.\n\nYou pushed him back to lie flat on your cloak, pressing your bodies together from chest to knee.\n\nYou could feel the hot insistent shape of him against your hip, and you shivered as he tugged your shirt free from your breeches and ran his hands up your ribs.\n\nHis palms were as firm and calloused as you had imagined.\n\nYou rocked against each other for a little while, reveling in the smooth shift of his muscles under your hands, pressing your mouth against his neck.\n\nHe held you close, his hands wandering from your shoulders to the small of your back to your ass, caressing and kneading like he could never get enough of you. \n\nWhen you pulled back just enough to get a look at his face, his eyes were half-lidded, pupils blown, like a drugged man.\n\nYou kissed him on the mouth again, watching his eyes flutter closed, and let him wrap you in his arms.\n\nHis breath caught when your hand went to his groin, his hips jerking up toward your touch.\n\n\u201cTell me if you want to stop,\u201d you said, though every line of his face and body shouted more.\n\nHe shook his head and mirrored your own movements, pressing his hand against you through your breeches. \n\nYou tugged at his shirt and jerkin and he raised his arms to let you pull them off; you had to stop and look for a moment at the first sight of his bare chest, painted gold and red by the firelight.\n\nHe met your eyes then, and gave you a small smile.\n\nHe was such a mix of contradictions: strength and tenderness, humility and pride, duty and pleasure; all you could do was kiss him again and unlace his breeches with impatient hands.\n\nHe stifled a cry when you wrapped your hand around him. \n\n\u201cSo thick,\u201d you whispered in his ear, open admiration in your voice, and he whimpered in earnest, his eyes squeezing shut. You worked him slowly, savoring every twitch and shudder and moan that he gave. \u201cAm I the first to see you like this?\u201d you asked, running your thumb up the length of him.\n\n\u201cFirst to\u2026 touch. Not the first to see.\u201d He opened his eyes to look at your face, and must have liked what he saw there, as he shut his eyes again and thrust into your hand. \u201cI went to a bathhouse. In Caldeum. I\u2026 watched a squire named Demetri get dominated by 5 me-...\u201d\n\nHe moans, rutting into your palm, story interrupted.\n\nYou pictured him there, skin flushed and slick from steam, breath heavy, hand on his own cock as he watched other men touch and suck and fuck each other. \n\nYou wondered if anyone had offered themselves to him; if that iron will had been tested.\n\nYou moaned at the thought and rocked your hips against him.\n\nHe hooked his thumbs into the top of your breeches, tugging down, and you obliged; your shirt went, too, for good measure.\n\nYou weren\u2019t as thickly muscled as he, but he didn\u2019t seem to mind.\n\nHis eyes roved appreciatively over your body.\n\n\u201cYou, too,\u201d you said, and he pulled off his boots and breeches as well, leaving nothing between you but a few inches of empty air.\n\nThe hair between his legs was shaved just as close as the hair on his head.\n\nHis cock stood hard against his belly (leaning just slightly to the right, you now noticed); without thinking, you licked your lips as you looked at it, and he made a choked noise in his throat.\n\nWhen you glanced up at his face, he reached for you, wrapping his arms around your shoulders and kissing you deep.\n\nIt was so good to feel the warmth of his skin against your own; Akarat knew how long it had been since you\u2019d had such a simple comfort.\n\nHis big, calloused hand found you; after a few rough urgent strokes, you said \u201cHere, like this,\u201d and showed him the grip and rhythm you needed.\n\nHe caught on quickly, and soon your breath was coming in gasps.\n\nYou wrapped your own hand around his cock and echoed his movements, but your own pleasure was outpacing his. \n\nHis eyes were open now, and he was watching your face, his breath catching and his cock twitching in your hand at every sigh and moan you let slip.\n\nYou relaxed into it, letting your own hand go loose and focusing on the feeling of his fingers around you, his chest pressed close to yours as he brought you to the edge and then over, letting yourself give voice to a rough wordless cry as you came in thick white spurts against him.\n\nIt was a few long moments before you found yourself again, but the crusader held you close, rubbing circles into your back as you caught your breath and blinked away stars. \n\n\u201cBy the Light,\u201d you whispered, and other soft blasphemies, and you felt rather than heard his chuckle.\n\nHis cock still stood, stiff and woefully unattended; when you once again had full control of your faculties, you turned your attention to it.\n\nHe took in a sharp breath when you shifted your body down and pressed your mouth to the crease of his hip. \n\nYou kissed the tip of his cock, just the faintest brush of lips, and looked up to see him watching you, his bottom lip caught between his teeth.\n\nYou smiled for his benefit, then wrapped your hand around the base and took the head in your mouth, cheeks hollowing as you ran your tongue over him.\n\nHe groaned and arched his back, his head pressing back against the rolled-up scarf that served as a pillow, but ever so carefully keeping his hips rutting deep into your throat, slowly in and then out.\n\nIn and out.",

Also lets look at middle class not some idealised rich person.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe same 7 companies control almost all of your audio/video entertainment.  Young actresses/actors have to perform on the casting room couch before they get a chance to perform on camera.  All of your entertainment is local live, or what the big companies want you to see, the best you can get otherwise is only available on folding tables in the disreputable parts of town.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at the disreputable parts of town, murders, rape, robbery were all 2 and 3 times worse in the 90s than they are now.  Getting mugged in any major city with a vibrant local flavor was common.  Your only way around town as middle class was in a death trap (compared to today) of a car with maybe only a drivers airbag.  Or a nasty taxi or public transit that you shared with many more homeless than now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso lets hope you don't need any medical care, its not the stone ages, but MRI's were rare, and very expensive.  Cancer treatment was better than it had ever been before, but almost all the treatments available now hadn't been invented yet.  Non smoking sections were just getting started, so most restaurants had a flavor of smoke added to each dish.  \n\nDon't forget the 50% of the world that lived in abject poverty in the 90s and could and did die from draughts, and pandemics in other parts of the world.  \n\nI could go on, but at most I would want to spend 10 years in the 90s before moving on to something better.",

The picture is considered one of her iconic works. The canvas shows Judith beheading Holofernes. The subject takes an episode from the apocryphal Book of Judith in the Old Testament,  which recounts the assassination of the Assyrian general Holofernes by the Israelite heroine Judith.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/trippinthroughtime/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

One thing that really caught my eye is \u2014 you know how many paintings for the 17th century (and before. And after) were praised for having less stringent body stands? Well, I just notice that she has an amazing grasp (in my opinion, a better one) on the female form. I notice all these little things you don\u2019t quite realize are missing from a number of the portraits. The tail of spence, and how well it\u2019s illustrated, in Lucretia is golden. All of her pieces have these minute, realistic differences.",

The story of Judith killing Holofernes is directly tied to Judith using her place as a woman of a conquered village to unassumingly infiltrate the enemy generals bedroom. It\u2019s a story directly tied to femininity, and a woman\u2019s power in the world at the time. \n\nLook at the posture and facial expression of Judith in each picture, in Caravaggio\u2019s painting, she looks like she\u2019s mildly inconvenienced while carving a Turkey. Artemisia\u2019s Judith looks like she\u2019s killing someone.\n\nI always like to point to the position of the handmaid in each painting too. Caravaggio, she\u2019s just sitting by and waiting for his head to fall into her bag. Gentischeli shows her holding him down, actively helping Judith. There\u2019s a much more real sense of sisterhood, of struggle and of triumph. Because that is what the story is actually about.",

I disagree that anyone's manhood prevents them from somehow understaning the situation or portraying the movement or emotion of the women involved well. That shortcoming is on Caravaggio and his skill as much as the depiction of blood is, not the fact that he is male.\n\nMaybe Artemisia captured the moment better because she understands people or specifically women better, but it isn't inherent to being born female any more than men have some sort of collective consciousness.\n\nRespect her for making it into the art world at a time when it was harder for women, respect her skill, respect her understanding of people and emotion, but don't attribute it to her sex. That's all.",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hot take to say that in general, women understand women historically better than men do. I never said it wasn\u2019t possible for men to portray women well, or that it was something inherent in the gender.

Caravaggio seems to assume that Judith would be dainty and delicate even while beheading someone - a clear reflection of a male perception of women. Artemisia's Judith is more determined, forceful, and aggressive. As a woman who experienced sexual violence herself, she understands that an angry woman wouldn't be looking so small and pretty as Caravaggio's Judith. Both artist's gender and perspective clearly plays a role on how each chose to portray her.",

I can figure out most conversational Spanish if it's written down, with the occasional words I have to guess at the definition via context clues, but I feel I have a solid grasp on verb conjugations, and can comfortably turn a new verb around in many different ways as soon as I learn it, or I at least know the tense of unrecognized verbs in sentences.\n\nI struggle to speak it conversationally, and feel like a child when I do, but I've carried on a few conversations with Spanish-only Uber drivers, often asking them to repeat words or phrases. \n\nI'm still not very good at listening to someone speak Spanish and follow along for longer than a sentence. It all just goes by too rapidly while my brain is trying to discern which words were heard.\n\nAll in all i can understand Spanish words very quickly now, like the definitions are muscle memory, but I haven't done enough listening to Spanish conversations, and so there's a noticeable disparity between that and text.\n\nI just need to talk to more people in Spanish.",

New broadcasts are boring but have a wide vocabulary enunciated carefully. Dramas have a lot of colloquialisms and kids cartoons are surprisingly good for gaining a solid grasp of the unique phonemes. You can start with subtitles then graduate to just watching without but I recommend at least an hour a day of just jumping into the deep end if you want to progress quicker.",

I have 6 years of Spanish through high school/college and feel like I could have gotten by (I'm covered in rust at this point but I do fine enough reading Spanish) so that's carrying me through Italian by sounding close enough. \n\nI know you can click on the words and it'll expand it and tell you the translation, but I really wish they would open each lesson with \"here's the rules we're going to be building on for the next couple activities: \" and show me that plurals have an I on the end but only sometimes because sometimes its an E and if you get it wrong you don't get an explanation for why, just that it's wrong because you guessed the wrong ending.  \nThe discussion tab is always closed for the lessons I'm on so I can't ask people, and the comments that are left there are 80% useless with the occasional explanation that's worth my time.\n\nAlso if Duo could reach through my screen and shape my mouth and tongue to how the heck I'm supposed to pronounce \"gli\" that would be dope as hell. I think I've pronounced it differently every time it comes up in the speaking activities.",

It definitely helps you learn the language but you need extra immersion to really build a proper and smoother understanding - ideally by speaking with other Spanish speakers, but  reading/listening to Spanish books or short stories or watching Spanish films helps too.\n  \nDuolingo added a \"stories\" tab at one point that was FANTASTIC for said immersion. I remember listening/reading to the Tell-tale Heart in Spanish, and really focusing on properly learning it.\n\nBut they changed the system recently by a lot and I'm not a fan - it took away a lot of choice from the lessons. You can't control/choose to do stories anymore, one gets unlocked after every 10-20 lessons. And you used to have some variety/choice in the lesson topic you chose for the day too - but now everything is this fixed linear list known as the \"new Duolingo learning path\".",

Had a 575 day streak and the new design - compounded by the glaringly painful fact that the top spots in the leagues were appearing to be out and out gamed by users (Googling for \u201cDuolingo cheats\u201d was both eye opening and disillusioning; doesn\u2019t make sense to ~~chat~~ cheat at a learning app, but people gonna be people) w/o any action or communications from Duolingo to address that while attempting to increasingly monetize or drive people to Plus - was the final nail in the coffin for me.\n\nExtended my streaks, and helped by streak freezes, through vacations, hospital stays, you name it. I\u2019m busy enough as it is with work and my personal life, but had been somewhat checked out on Duo for awhile basically playing to extend my streak without really learning anything new after going through Spanish and French in their entirety. \n\nDeleted the app after the redesign and been pursuing more immersive methods to continue learning on my own; haven\u2019t really looked back since and definitely don\u2019t miss the pushy notifications when I\u2019m trying to read or do something else I enjoy with what little free, personal time I have absent of other obligations.\n\nEdit: Spelling.",

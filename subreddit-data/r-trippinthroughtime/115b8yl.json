But you don't form a perfect vaccum when you drink, so some of it will always end up back in the drink.

It is however, enough to get you sick if you're sharing a glass with someone who is sick.",

At least that's how I do it.\n\nI just don't get people who put the whole bottle down their mouths, this includes family members...",

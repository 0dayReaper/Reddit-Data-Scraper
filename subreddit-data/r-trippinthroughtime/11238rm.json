Because grabbing them from the front is kind of awkward, unless they're level with your own shoulders.  As women are generally shorter, not taller, this is difficult.  Note this problem goes away if you're lying down and she's on top of you, as height is no longer an issue. However, wrapping your arms around a woman giving them a big hug and at the same time holding their boobs is always comfortable, and therefore ideal, assuming you're standing up talking to your guy friends, and not lying in bed with them.",

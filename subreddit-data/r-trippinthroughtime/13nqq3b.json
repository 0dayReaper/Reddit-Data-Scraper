I open one, insert a pill near the top (cut it up if need be in smaller pieces), squeeze a little Churu out to cover it up and let the cat lick the top of the Churu tube and squeeze the part with the pill into their mouths. If they find the pill and start to try to spit it out I squeeze more Churu in their mouth and they automatically swallow the pill and are just happy to have more treats. Works great on two of my cats that would otherwise be nightmares to pill and they actually come running for it when they hear the treat come out.",

But there will hopefully be something similar available to you.

I put a dollop on my right index finger, make a little hole with a spoon handle, drop the pill in the hole and use the spoon to cover the pill with another dollop on top. I cover it carefully so the smell of the pill (I can't smell it, but cats can) doesn't filter through. Works every time. Be careful when you're putting it together though, because cats are very clever and if they realise what you're doing, they'll never trust you with offered treats again. Also, give them a bit from time to time so they get used to it and don't smell a rat when you're actually giving them the pill. Best of luck.",

The South by contrast kept it going, forcing the North to return slaves in the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. And also true that lots of guys in the North fought and died for slaveries end in the Civil War. So it\u2019s not really equal sides of a coin here.",

It\u2019s the fact that the north profited off of selling food and other supplies to the southern states up to the middle of the Civil War to keep the machine going. The Massachusetts cod explosion and the Tennessee/Virginia hog trade just to name a few made those states lots of money keeping the slaves fed. After the cotton gin, southern states devoted all of their land to cotton growth and needed supplies to keep the slaves fed, those supplies came from the northern and western non slave states. Northern figures like Sherman, Hamilton and even Lincoln did not want the slaves here and thought of the slaves as \u201cless than.\u201d It\u2019s a dangerous thing to pas slavery off as just a \u201csouthern\u201d thing.",

One side directly profited from slavery while the other one provided basic essentials. Without the the Northern supplies the South would still use slaves, just in different agricultural aspects. But the North wasn\u2019t even the South\u2019s primary cotton trading partners, so that\u2019s significantly more degrees removed from slavemasters on horseback with whips in 1850. It\u2019s also fair to say the abolitionists were not some profound humans who wanted true equality. Just slightly more equality than what was present",

Mainly due to the way each representative holds authority, by their own districts or states. Basically every state is their own party and every county is their own party. The point is, the constitution was written initially for representatives to only care about their county and their state. Political parties arguably allowed the entire nation to unify instead of having 50 different viewpoints.",

No way that lasts 250 years though.\n\nBut I also think that today's political parties are as much prescriptive as they are descriptive (i.e., they aren't just binning like-minded people, they are telling people how to think). It's absurd to think that the country is nearly divided into two groups that are diametrically opposed in their thinking on 20+ issues. A more accurate way of categorizing people would be if we had coalitions around different causes that could overlap. If there were more money going to these individual groups (e.g. pro-gun vs anti-gun groups) and less money going to political parties, labels like Republican and Democrat would be less influential. The difference is sorta like sorting your email by folder (political parties) or tags (issues).",

When there is a ceiling mural in the capitol building called \u201cthe deification of Washington\u201d which features angels surrounding him on the throne of heaven, it\u2019s clear that he was more a symbolic leader than a actual political one. Obviously he made decisions as president, but the reason he was elected president was because he was the commander of the continental army, not because he was a great politician, he was a business man if anything.  When the whiskey rebellion happened because a lot of revolutionary veterans were upset about economic inequality, rather than fixing the issue through policy like the people demanded, he rode his horse with an army behind him and terrified the people into submission.  His job was to keep the newly born country together, and one of the ways to do that was to advocate against parties during its formative years.   Washington likely knew parties and factions would form eventually, but he had to make the country feel unified at a time when people were still trying to figure out what the country really was.",

You either toe the party line or you're not a \"true [party member]\" to your peers. You can't be a Republican in today's society and think that abortion is okay in cases of rape. You can't be a Democrat and call for looser gun restrictions. It's all or nothing, and if you're not one of \"us\" then you're one of \"them\" and therefore bad.  \n\nHaving parties is fine, but it should never have become either-or or us vs. them. It's okay to opt not to belong to a party because politics are extremely nuanced and complicated and it's not healthy for our democracy to have some nameless, faceless organizations determine what's right and wrong for us. And I think that's what Washington was warning us about.",

So long as only one person can win in a district, the system cannot, practically speaking, yield a proportionate result, and will thus always favour larger parties.\n\nProportional representation would be most likely to yield a Congress which most reflects voting preferences. That would require multi-member districts, which would be quite a departure from today. But, these are are common in other parts of the world, like Europe. Notable voting systems include [party list proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation) and [mixed-member proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation).\n\nEven more fundamentally, though, if we are concerned about the general quality of the political system, the presidential system should itself also be subject to scrutiny. Even with instant-runoff voting, it is a system which places a lot of power into the hands of a single person. That does not reflect the more nuanced nature of politics in reality. It also means that within the domain of presidential power, parties either win everything or lose everything. Further, because of the separation of powers between the president and Congress, political deadlock and paralysis is much more likely to occur, yielding suboptimal political outcomes.\n\nAn alternative to the presidential system would be to introduce a parliamentary system with proportional representation. If designed well, such a system would yield more mature and representative governance. Voters would have the choice to vote for parties across the political spectrum. Those parties would negotiate with one another and a majority of them would form a governing coalition. That coalition would be led by a prime minister, who would require the continual confidence of the legislature, and their coalition partners.\n\nAmerica does not seem to have a great track record with reform in general, let alone changing its whole political system. I would be very surprised if it did so, but that does not negate the fact that it most certainly should do so. There are solutions to the problems that America faces. One need simply look out into the world and observe how other countries govern themselves. The core problem is that America must summon the will to actually implement these solutions, to eschew piecemeal change, and to pursue real and substantive change.",

The problems in America are caused by white supremacy and American Evangelism, not by the ability for one party to monopolise the votes of those who pledge allegiance to those causes. Attack the problem at its root.",

In my very humble opinion I think that there is no system that would always work better than the others in every country. The point of the US federal election system is that the terms of the Congress and the President are different, so you could have a Republican President with a democratic Congress and vice versa. \n\nSo obviously this means that the two parties are forced to collaborate, or at least to dialogue, which you guys have always done in the course of your history. The problem today is that Dems and Republicans are completely polarized. Or at least this is what I perceive living in Europe and following American politics. \n\nHonestly I don't know if changing the election system is the best way to solve your political issues. Whenever someone asks me what should the US do to improve their situation I always say that you guys really need to improve your education system. I'd start from there. But I'm nobody so don't take me too seriously ahah",

I personally think the biggest issue facing the country now is voter disenfranchisement. There's so many issues that allow the establishment / right wing / white america to keep disproportionate voting power:\n\n* The Senate and Electoral Colleges, where each state gets two Senators and at least three votes in the electoral college regardless of population, giving voters in less populous (and typically less urban and less conservative) states a lot more weight to their vote.\n* Election days are not holidays, so lower income people must find ways to vote while keeping up their lives, which might involve stricter/longer working hours. Additionally, some states say you must provide a reason to vote by mail, making it harder for people to vote in advance.\n* Voter ID laws, which supposedly innocuously require people to bring ID to vote to \"avoid fraud,\" but which actually hit low-income and minority groups the hardest because they are less likely to have an ID due to other disenfranchisement.\n* Screwing with the census, which is used to track populations and thus distribute political seats. Recently the Trump admin fought to attempt to add a question to the census about citizenship-- which would likely have discouraged undocumented immigrants from answering the census, and thus under count the population of that geographic area.\n* Felons are not allowed to vote. However, again, felons are far more likely to be minority groups than white, so again this is a way of taking votes away from those populations-- especially bad considering the ways in which we are now beginning to realize drug laws (which are a huge source of minority convictions) are problematic.\n* Suspicious closings of polling places in low-income areas, leading to crazy lines that discourage votes. This [JUST HAPPENED](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/06/kentucky-slashes-polling-places-voting-rights-mcgrath-booker-lebron-james/) in Kentucky.\n* Though used by both parties to their advantage, [Gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering), where political districts are geographically divided up to artificially preserve seats with little contest, is still an anti-democratic move that protects the establishment.\n\nI think legislation which enshrines the right to vote *conveniently* would be a huge step towards breaking the chokehold the established interests have over the US, as it would allow outsider campaigns to more easily fight disenfranchisement in the courts. I also think all felons should be allowed to vote.",

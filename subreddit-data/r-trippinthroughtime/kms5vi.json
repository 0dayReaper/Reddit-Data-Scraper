Saving up as much as I could so that I could study in 2020.\n\nIt's taken me more than 10 years, but I finally know what I want to do.\n\nThere's a huge bridge that I need to try and cross between my uneducated self and getting into the uni course that I want though.\n\nSo 2020 was meant to be spent trying to cross that bridge.\n\nAnd then covid hit.\n\nI found myself unemployed again and it took my government months before I was able to start receiving unemployment benefits.\n\nIn those months I burnt literally all of my savings, just trying to pay rent and bills.\n\n-\n\nNow we've reached the end of 2020.\n\nI'm still unemployed. I haven't been able to do any study at all. Because even the most basic (creditable) online courses have been financially out of reach.\n\nMy unemployment benefits are about to be reduced next week, to the point where after paying for rent, I'll have $4/day left to somehow cover food, bills and literally anything else that comes my way.\n\nI honestly don't know what I'm going to do.",

I\u2019m required to work 6pm-5am Monday-Friday and two Saturdays a month for eight hours apiece (all through the pandemic, never shut down once). \n\nI stayed sober this year. I got a car this year. I got my own apartment this year. I was able to afford long-overdue dental surgery this year. All because I couldn\u2019t do anything except work and sleep. \n\nIf it had been a normal year, I feel that my depression would have worsened to the point of needing intervention, or worse, relapsed on meth. Night shift is lonely enough as it is; having to work 63 hours a week on night shift is completely isolating.\n\nWith the shutdowns and quarantines and social distancing, I missed out on NOTHING this year. I wasn\u2019t able to go out and I wasn\u2019t able to spend much money \u2014 but neither was anyone else. It\u2019s a big bummer for the rest of the world, but for me, this year has been instrumental in paving a bright path for the coming years. :)",

            "comment": "No. Fuck that. Ive been sitting around the house on sick leave, while on the job i hated a lot. Worked there for 7 years. Dreaming of a job in IT. Shit pay. Shit colleagues. \n\nSo the sick leave was also because im a critical patient. Im chronically ill. If i get covid. There is a big chance id die. \n\nSat around the house for 2 years. Working 4/8 hrs a day until the last year where i just said fuck it and quit all together(paid of course). \n\nStarted applying for my dream job. Was like fuck it, i can do this. Even without credentials. \n\nGet hired at this fashion place. IT Support. Amazing pay. Amazing teachers. Fun as fuck job. Everything i ever wanted. Went from no hrs on the job to 38+ hrs and feeling amazing. 50 min commute also has me doing what i couldnt back at my 5min commute shit job. Listen to music. \n\nIt was dangerous for me to get in the office. But i wanted to work so bad, i didnt care. \n\nBest year ive ever had.",

A living artist will not just make commissioned works; they\u2019ll get an idea from somewhere and, on their own volition, create some novelty. The AI can only generate something if instructed to do so. \n\nIt\u2019s why I\u2019d be more impressed by a concert pianist and the composer than a player piano I guess",

Mordhau, using both hands to pummel with the hilt, is considered a form of it, although might not have been immediately back in \n 14th century Germany. Many people conflate the two perfectly, I suspect largely due to [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vwuQPfvSSlo) video that went around, he does explain the different forms but features mordhau much more prominently while leaving it unnamed iirc.",

It was a last ditch effort to use the leverage of the blade to either hit with the pommel (counterweight at the end of the handle) for a bludgeoning effect, that wouldn't go through any armor, but a well placed strike can most definitely disorient the opponent (ask me how I know) or to put all of that leverage behind the point on the guard which can actually pierce historic plate with enough force. A murder strike is basically an \"oh shit I gotta do something or I'm going to die\" move against a walking tank. The training involved with a murder strike does teach to place the flat of the blade against your palm and wrap your fingers around the other side with a gap between your knuckles and the edge. If you're doing it right, even without leather lined gauntlets or gloves, you should* never make contact with the edge, of course, the impact usually says otherwise, but even that is not a huge issue. Cutting with a blade, unless very well sharpened, which historical swords were not by modern standards, requires both horizontal movement and lateral pressure, meaning you could actually grip the blade and not cut yourself unless your hand moves up and down along the blade, which again, could happen on impact. As a last note, swords were backup weapons during the middle ages, not primaries. A soldier going into battle would usually have a pole arm (halberd, spear, big pointy on a stick that could generate huge amounts of force behind a piercing point,) and, if they could afford one, a sword or a good dagger on their hip as a backup.\n\nEdit: this is of course my understanding of the small amount of documentation and source materials we have. Wiggle room on understanding is warranted.",

My personal favorite is when a shorter opponent gets close in on me (I'm a tall bitch) I give them a nice fun bonk on the head with the pommel of my longsword, step out and strike on the way out. That's a sports move though. My understanding is on the battlefield, daggers killed the majority of armored soldiers when two people on foot fought against each other, the idea being use your big weapons to keep distance, and do what you can to kill them there, but knowing you're most likely going to end up real close together, so tie up your opponents weapon with yours, find yourself in close and either get them on the ground or do this standing up; take out your dagger and find the weak spots of the armor (armpits, back of the knees, under the chin.) To an extent in early medieval times but definitely as plate got better and better at covering those spots, very few armored soldiers actually died during battle for two main reasons. 1. Armor does its job really really well, and 2. Armor was expensive. Only the rich could afford a full set, so if you saw someone on the battlefield who had that armor, you'd try and capture them to ransom back for money.",

I do however actively study this stuff as an interest.\n\nAgain, I can tell you from lived fighting experience that a longsword hit from the blade is VERY different than a strike from the pommel or guard. At this point, I barely feel a blade strike, but a pommel strike throws your head around. \n\nYes, bind and trip up your opponent or get away, that's a given, but imagine your in maybe a narrow corridor of a castle, or in rough terrain, basically imagine you can't get away without fighting this opponent. You then have 2 main options. You can half sword like the opponent on the left and try to find the weakness in the armor, but risk getting hit by your opponent in the process, or you could murder strike and have a little bit more distance, and yes, more leverage. This \"silly strike\" was taught for the scenario of last ditch effort, as I said in my original post. It was not something to use regularly.",

Even more so than just ringing their bell with the blade end.\n\nTo break armour you need a lot of weight behind a thin punch. So a sword hilt like this is just you wasting time instead of chucking the sword and picking up a proper weapon.\n\nAlledgedly they traine dto use this and folk who practice will claim it works but without actually killing somebody or wining a real fight with it nobody really knows. Also you have to factor in how much these old masters who wrote these books talked bollocks or padded them out for dosh.\n\nHeres an example most folk won't know.\n\nWhich weapon do think does more real life damage when you land a hit with iit.\n\nA light curved cavalry saber used from horse back or a heavy straight cavalry saber used from horseback. \n\nThe answer is teh light saber. It actually made deeper wounds. Folk have teste dthis on carcasses from horseback. Due to the curve of the sword it saws deeper. The  weight of blades don't matter when you have an entire horse behind it.\n\nWhile straight swords were used lots they were eventually phased from real world use for curved sabres for horse back precisely because they killed usually in one good hit.\n\nSo always take these manuals with a pinch of salt cos a good lot of them will be just as useless as akido.",

[Mordhau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordhau_(weaponry)), using both hands to pummel with the hilt, is considered a form of it, simply called the murder stroke, a technique that used half-swording with both hands  \n\nMany people conflate the two perfectly, I suspect largely due to [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vwuQPfvSSlo) video that went around a while back. He does explain the two different forms but features mordhau much more prominently while leaving it unnamed besides \u201cthe murder stroke\u201d, which is less clear to non-German and non-giant fucking nerd audiences.

The butterfly effect is fascinating - one man\u2019s emotional agony causing most of Western Civ to think that women are sick and that sex is inherently evil until JPII comes along last century",

I'm a westerner (group up Lutheran in fact) but converted to Orthodoxy and so as such I've never been super familiar with JPII or recent Catholic figures. My knowledge of the catholic church has a steep drop off after the 1500s lol",

                                    "comment": "Sure! JPII is most well-known for Theology of the Body, a series of addresses describing how the sexual act is not inherently sinful, but rather a symbol of God\u2019s love for humanity and a reflection of Trinitarian life. Since we are composite beings, our male and female bodies are truly \u201cus\u201d as much as our souls are, and express us uniquely as human persons. He grounds Catholic sexual ethics in both the personalistic norm (persons are not to be used) and Trinitarian metaphors (self-giving love begets all life) while taking on both the sexual revolution and the shadow of Augustine\u2019s scrupulosity.\n\nHe also addresses the dignity and status of women in \u201cLetter to Women\u201d (which is short and a good read) and the longer encyclical Mulieris Dignitatem. He takes care to describe and emphasize the *feminine genius*, counteracting both the historical oppression of women and the cultural hatred of femininity that arose with second-wave feminism.\n\nHe lived and wrote in tumultuous times, but from my perspective his work was almost a \u201credemption arc\u201d correcting critical deficiencies in Western thought. I\u2019d even argue that personalist philosophy influenced JPII positively much like the Manichaean philosophy influenced Augustine negatively. \n\nHere\u2019s an extremely long article that explains pretty much everything about it: https://www.nfpoutreach.org/47 :D",

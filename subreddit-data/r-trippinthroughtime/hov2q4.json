I'm not sure if bail was at issue here or if it was just an arraignment. The guy obviously sold some weed.\n\nBut apparently the judge is a jackass.\n\nhttps://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2017/01/09/passaic-county-judge-faces-misconduct-charges-wading-into-custody-case/96266620/\n\n&gt; Judicial conduct officials alleged that DeAvila-Silebi inappropriately inserted herself in the case, which had been assigned to another judge in Essex County. She also faces allegations that she neglected to investigate the case properly before calling the police to ask that they assist Chermont in picking up the child from the father, who is not identified.\n\nI guess she was brought up on improper judicial conduct charges because she took a phone call from a guy posing as a lawyer (imposter) and immediately involved the police in a custody matter to take a child away from his father to give to the child's mother, when the judge in question was not even assigned to that case and had been reassigned May 1st.\n\nThen she was barred from the bench and[ stripped of her pension,](https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2019/01/03/former-passaic-county-judge-has-pension-revoked/2465735002/) wtf:\n\n&gt; DeAvila-Silebi came under fire in 2015 for helping Vivianne Chermont, a former judicial intern, win custody of her child for Mother's Day weekend. State investigators found that DeAvila-Silebi placed a phone call to Fort Lee police, informing them that Chermont had a court order to have her 5-year-old son on Mother's Day weekend, but the father took custody instead. \n\n&gt; The order, however, never existed. DeAvila-Silebi also misrepresented to police that she was the presiding judge over the Bergen County case, when she was actually a civil division judge in Passiac County. \n\n&gt; The state Supreme Court **dismissed** Liliana DeAvila-Silebi in September from her seat on the bench for violating the state's Code of Judicial Conduct. In early December, members of the New Jersey State House Commission followed with a rare vote to strip DeAvila-Silebi of her pension, the first time that has happened in at least 10 years, according to state Sen. Gerald Cardinale, a commission member.\n\nSo she basically used her position as judge (she became a civil judge after 2015, I assume this was when she was hearing criminal cases from 2010-2015) to help a friend/intern in a custody dispute. And kept lying about it / providing cover stories for why she did what she did. It was weird",

Sir, you have to wear clothes in here and also please stop carrying around a bloody head. It's dripping all over. Holy shit, is her hair made of snakes?\" And then Perseus went out to his car and walked back into the store with a sheet dangling behind him and tells the door guy, \"There. I'm wearing clothes. Can I come in now? Sorry if I was snappy earlier. To be honest, I'm kinda stoned. Get it? Because I'm stone? Also because this is Medusa? This is one of those multi-level jokes. Anyway, what aisle has like picture frame wall mounts for severed heads?\" And then the door guy just stands there thinking, \"Why did I ask to transfer to the Olympus Walmart?\"\n\nAnyway stay tuned for Tales from the Olympus Walmart Chapter 2: \"The Zeus is Loose\"",

The original is in the Vatican museum; the replica is in the Met.\n\nThe statue was based off the [Apollo Belvedere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Belvedere), a Roman statue from the mid 2nd century AD. It's believed to be Roman because of the distinct Roman style of footwear, but the Vatican Museum believes it may well be based off a Greek bronze statue from 330-320 BC by Leochares, who worked in what is now Bodrum in Turkey.",

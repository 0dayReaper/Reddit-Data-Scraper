One time she hid in the trunk of her boyfriend's car. I don't know exactly what she was diagnosed with. I just know that she went to a lake. Swam to the middle, then straight down. She then started to drink as much water as she possibly could. Her dad (my great grandfather) committed suicide after my grandpa left for Vietnam, as he had cancer. Which was a death sentence in those years. My grandpa's brother killed himself because he was the one who found their dad. Same shotgun, and spit in the barn. My grandpa found him. Funny story really, my grandpa literally got to Vietnam. Got a letter telling him to return because of his father's death. Then his brother committed suicide. Which had went to the barn (where he was found) to say goodbye to him. The army never asked for him to come back.",

The original guy even said he can't date because he can't get a job. The result of that is that his biggest issue is getting/keeping a job. im guessing motivation is an issue. wanna know what suffers if you're hitting those chemical receptors in your brain with rewards for no real accomplishments all day? motivation. \n\n\nlook: if you're a betting person, would you bet the situation is closer to my guess or yours? [enter the part where you shamelessly back away from that question while feigning a high road you want to conveniently fabricate as opposed to actually answering]",

            "comment": "Psycologically and physiologically...the human body will grow dependant on certain things, such as melatonin, laxatives, intense vibrations...etc. If your sleep schedule is really screwed up and you constantly supplement melatonin, your body actually decreases the way it naturally supplies it and you grow dependant on it in order to ever sleep properly again. If your bowels are messed up and they become dependant on laxatives, it is very possible that you'll need laxatives on a consistent basis for your bowels to function.. If you use vibrators consistently, it messes with the nerves and overall function of your body chemistry and you grow wildly dependant on the high reving vibrator to get intense sexual satisfaction (which in turn dulls the experience when you're with a regular person and takes an exceedingly high level of stimulation to get you to orgasm).The same thing goes for men. If they masturbate too often or use highly explicit porn, this destroys the depth of intimacy and the true ability to connect with their partner during sex. These things have been clinically proven. The lack of a deeper connection in your relationship/marriage might be stemming from something like this. \n\nFood for thought. I just wanted everyone to be aware of the clinical studies that have been researched. Thanks for reading this reply.",

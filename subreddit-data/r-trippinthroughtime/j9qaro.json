Compiled languages (such as C, C++, Pascal) are handled by the machine itself--it will convert the code into 0s and 1s without assistance. Interpreted languages (such as Python and Javascript), on the other hand, require another program, an interpreter, to do the converting. The coding environments I've used to write programs with interpreted languages have all included the interpreter in their software packages.\n\nI'm but a fledgling programmer, however, so I'm sure more experienced folks could elaborate more on the subject for ya.",

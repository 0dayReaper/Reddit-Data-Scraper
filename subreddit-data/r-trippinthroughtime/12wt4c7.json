It is becoming more widely accepted that Medusa is seen as a victim rather than a monster. And this art piece, in my opinion, reflects that. Look at Perseus's form and how dominating it is compared to Medusa who looks more like she's calling for help. We the viewers see her soft features compared to Perseus's hard features it forms an idea on who actually is the evil one and who is the good one.",

Ive read some fanfics that were better than some original stories. The point stands that it wasnt the original version told in greece. Preseus was tasked eoth killing a dangeroud monster. Retroactively turning her into a human and a victim while keeping the original monster slaying is an unfair change in the source material. Because it repaints the whole thing. Which was ovid's point, but he went about it by rewriting what someone else wrote down. Presenting it as just another version of the myth instead of specific retelling on an existing one give it legitimacy that dpesnt make sense given the dissonance it causes. The story is fine, but it is essentially an allegory that takes over an existing myth",

So the vast majority of the population only knows of Medusa in terms of when she is brought up in pop culture context. And that almost never goes into her backstory. \n\nThe SA tattoo thing seems to be a very recent trend, driven by tiktok of all things (only based on my googling over the past few minutes, so definitely not exhaustive). I do like that symbolism now that I understand its meaning. But I also don't think OP should be looked down upon for not knowing it. \n\nAlso, FWIW, OP's meme isn't about sexual assault, although the content is certainly *SA adjacent*. The meme only makes sense in the context of two people who have discussed a particular kink enough that they've agreed to a safe word beforehand. That implies a level of respect for the importance of consent in such play.",

I know a lot of people who haven't studied Classics as a subject and knew the Ovid variant more than than the pre-Ovid so it sounds anecdotal either which way.\n\nThe tattoo trend was popularised on TikTok but us based on an understanding of the myth so again: not sure what to make of that. I didn't necessarily say OP should be looked down on necessarily, just that the current trend of understand of Medusa has a slant towards sexual abuse which has been co-opted by a collective of people who have been sexually abused, so the meme can come across bad, much like how people could unknowingly be making any kind of potentially harmful memes without realising it.\n\nForgetting a safe word and then sex continuing means you're having sex against your will which...is pretty much the definition of sexual assault. How that comes out in the wash is difficult, sure, but the picture literally shows one person dominating the other with the second person being an unwilling participant tied up in a meme about not being able to stop someone having sex with you which all in all is pretty sexual assault-y even without the Roman myth of Medusa featuring rape in its origin...\n\nEh, fuck it, cba though now.",

These are kids so severely abused that they actually feel pleasure as a response to pain and are caught trying to kill their adoptive parents and family members unprovoked. I knew some people who worked with children adopted in the 90s from Russian orphanages. Most eventually had to be committed because there was absolutely no other way to prevent them from continuing to hurt others (and possibly kill, as adults the diagnosis changed to sociopathy). \n\nSuper sad reality that often gets missed in the Medusa story. Perseus just enslaved her by removing her free agency (body) and turned her into a weapon against her will. Like all those who have resorted to assassination over the centuries. The first step is to find someone already damaged enough to do it, and once they do you own their secret and can compel them unwillingly from then on.",

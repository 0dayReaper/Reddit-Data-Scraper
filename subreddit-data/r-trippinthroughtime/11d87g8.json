Wouldn't you be better for directing your energies at yourself or the people in charge? \n\nLike if servers have it so much better then how can you become one? \n\nOr maybe if the restaurant is pulling down a premium you could advocate for the kitchen to be paid more than \"gets fucked\".\n\nYour suffering is irrelevant to their suffering. Your suffering is your suffering and thus you should do something about your suffering as opposed to complaining about how everyone else isn't AS fucked as you are.",

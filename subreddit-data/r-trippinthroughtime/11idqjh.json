            "comment": "The Sleeping Gypsy (French: La Boh\u00e9mienne endormie) is an 1897 oil painting by French artist Henri Rousseau (1844\u20131910). It is a fantastical depiction of a lion musing over a sleeping woman on a moonlit night.Rousseau first exhibited the painting at the 13th Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, and tried unsuccessfully to sell it to the mayor of his hometown, Laval. Instead, it entered the private collection of a Parisian charcoal merchant where it remained until 1924, when it was discovered by the art critic Louis Vauxcelles. The Paris-based art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler purchased the painting in 1924, although a controversy arose over whether the painting was a forgery. It was acquired by art historian Alfred H. Barr Jr. for the New York Museum of Modern Art.\n\nRousseau described his painting as follows: \"A wandering Negress, a mandolin player, lies with her jar beside her (a vase with drinking water), overcome by fatigue in a deep sleep. A lion chances to pass by, picks up her scent yet does not devour her. There is a moonlight effect, very poetic.\"\n\n\\-\n\n\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" is a song originally written and recorded by Solomon Linda  under the title \"Mbube\" (Zulu for \"lion\") for the South African Gallo Record Company in 1939. Linda's original was written in isiZulu, while the English version's lyrics were written by George David Weiss.\n\nAccording to journalist Rian Malan:\"Mbube\" wasn't the most remarkable tune, but there was something compelling about the underlying chant, a dense meshing of low male voices above which Solomon yodelled and howled for two exhilarating minutes, improvising occasionally. The third take was the best, achieving immortality when Solly took a deep breath, opened his mouth, and improvised the melody that the world now associates with these words:\n\nIn the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight.\n\nThe song was adapted and covered internationally by many pop and folk revival artists in the 1950s and 1960s. It was recorded as \"Wimoweh\" by the Weavers in November 1951, in 1961, a version adapted into English with the title \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" by the doo-wop group the Tokens became a number-one hit in the United States.  The pop group Tight Fit had a number one hit in the UK with the song in 1982.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is an amazing quality version of the original along with the more widely known version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPn01QeJEYQ",

It is a coming of age story about a shepherd from Spain who travels to Egypt in search of a treasure  he dreams about. I also read The Devil and Miss Prym which is about lies, deception, greed, and religion when a tourist comes to a small town and causes chaos over the promise of treasure, testing if the nature of humans is good or evil.",

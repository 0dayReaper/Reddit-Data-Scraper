This warehouse was apparently a dilapidated mess and was used for film shoots whenever crews needed an 'abandoned factory'. \n\nOnce that accountant got the boot, the boss, who ran an aftermarket car accessories business had to get his stockpile of mats out of that rat infested hellhole, and figured despite the rainbow colors of mold on the boxes that some of the shipment could be salvaged, so on a hot summer's day three employees had to unload this mess in the blazing sun. \n\nThose stupid mats sat around for years, no customer wanted them. They ended up just getting dumpstered three years after that.",

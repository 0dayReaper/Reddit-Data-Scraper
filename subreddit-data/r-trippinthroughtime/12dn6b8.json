Do YOU know how gambling works\"\n\nTo which he replied \"no I have no idea this makes no sense to me\" lmao so I then told him how it works with betting on the favorite a win just means you get your deposit, plus a smaller iteration of your deposit back and they dont just keep the initial amount in, and how betting on an underdog gives you a multiple of your deposit, plus the deposit and he very graciously thanked me. \n\nSometimes it goes somewhere lol",

But you always got me until I joined a guild and had 3 level 60s literally walk me through Methenil to the next flight path. We had a hunter casting flares as we scooted to safety. We caught you out for a second but you popped Vanish while I ran my ass off.\n\nYou killing me a lot directly led me to rerolling a tank and endgame raiding with that guild I joined to get past YOU.\n\nI have feared things under my bed less than I feared you. Next time I babysit my neices and nephews I will tell them bedtime stories about how Angwe can pop out of nowhere. And even if you live through the first strike the poison damage will tick and still kill you.",

Ain't nobody got time for that! It's like a roadblock in my scrolling game, slowing me down and killing my vibe.\n\n  \n\n\nAnd don't even get me started on how overwhelming long comments can be! When I see a never-ending block of text with no breaks or formatting, it's like trying to navigate a maze without a map. My brain just goes into overload mode, and I'm left feeling lost and confused. Come on, people, throw in some paragraphs, bullet points, or something to make it easier on the eyes!\n\n  \n\n\nPlus, what's the deal with long comments lacking organization and coherence? I feel like I need a PhD in deciphering to make sense of some of these rants. They're all over the place, jumping from one point to another, and I'm left scratching my head, trying to figure out what the heck the author is even trying to say. Ain't nobody got time for mental gymnastics!\n\n  \n\n\nAnd you know what's the worst? Long comments that are biased or misleading. Like, seriously, people, back up your claims with some legit sources! Just because you're typing a mini-novel doesn't mean you're spitting truth bombs. I need receipts, people! Otherwise, it's just opinions and anecdotes flying around, and that's not helpful or reliable.\n\n  \n\n\nAnd don't even get me started on how long comments can kill the engagement vibes! I'm all about lively discussions and diverse perspectives, but when I see a never-ending comment thread, it's like a participation killer. Ain't nobody got the time or energy to craft a response to a comment that could double as a novella. It's like a conversation black hole that sucks the life out of the discussion!\n\n  \n\n\nLook, I love Reddit and the opportunity to connect with fellow Redditors, but these long comments gotta be reigned in, folks! Keep it concise, organized, and backed up with legit sources. Let's make the comments section a place for meaningful interactions, not a marathon of scrolling and decoding. Ain't nobody got time for that! So, let's keep the comments short and sweet, and bring the energy back to the discussion!\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n(Thanks chat gpt, I would never have bothered to write that.)",

A random example:\n\n&gt; Aeris vs. Aerith\n\n&gt; The Final Fantasy VII character was introduced to English audiences in 1997 as Aeris, but her name changed to Aerith in later appearances. Was the first name a misspelling? A mistranslation from the original Japanese pronunciation? But that's how it was when it was first released in English so that makes it her official name. But the later appearances are official too right? But she was known and referred to as Aeris for years, so that makes it the common name. But she's been going by Aerith since 2002, so now that's her common name. Many edit wars, page moves, and lengthy discussions later, the page is at Aerith Gainsborough and when mentioning her first 1997 appearances, she is called Aeris. All other appearances are called Aerith. With every title in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII using Aerith, the warring and discussions seem to have ended. The lengthy discussions are archived at Talk:Aerith Gainsborough/Name debate archive (page size of the archive is 113kb).\n\nEdit: Also:\n\n&gt; As of September 2022, the talk page for Hummus states: \"The article Hummus, along with other articles relating to the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict, is currently subject to active arbitration remedies.\"",

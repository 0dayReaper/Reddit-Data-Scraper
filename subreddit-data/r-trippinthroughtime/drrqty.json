Even then, people who sit around all day and eat themselves into obesity, can live as old as 60-70, which was about the maximum lifespan for **most** people of the past. We have more people making it to 80-100 right now than we ever have before. The reason we generally don\u2019t live much longer than that despite advances that have been made in longevity research, is because of aging, as our cells continue to divide, the telomeres in our DNA get smaller and smaller until they\u2019re gone and then as division continues to happen, mutation takes place, as there\u2019s nothing really protecting the DNA strands any more. Chronic diseases start to pile up, the body\u2019s ability to repair itself is dissipated, we eventually can\u2019t handle it and we die.\n\nFortunately, science is looking into creative ways to solve the aging issue and things are really looking good for anybody who\u2019s still alive in a couple decades, assuming we make it through this climate crisis. \n\nPoint is, we **are** living healthier and that\u2019s why generally, we live longer than we used to.",

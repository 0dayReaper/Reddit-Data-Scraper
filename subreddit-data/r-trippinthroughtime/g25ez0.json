in Kiruna, Sweden.\n\nI was sitting on my couch trying to wait out the winter storm.\n\nAll of my favourite TV shows were currently taken off air to give us radar images and forcasts of the storm which just\ngave us all less hope.\n\nI really didn't get it, why would you take the TV shows off air during a storm?\n\nWhat else was there to do when you are encased in 5 metre snow banks?\n\nStruggling to find something to occupy the time, I walked over to my bedroom closet where I kept my games. \n\nLooking inside I saw Monopoly, Chess, and Settlers.\n\nHave you ever played any of those, FeFiFoPinky?\n\nThey used to tell me, FeFiFo, wow look at Demetri, he\u2019s so good at um.. touching those chess pieces like nipples.\n\nAnyways.\n\nWhat a great time to be stuck between relationships, I have fuckall to do alone.\n\nI kept digging in my closet, past all of the sex toys from my father let me borrow but I never returned to him and finally found a deck of cards.\n\nPhew, now I can at least play Solitare.\n\nThe clock struck 2000.\n\nAfter playing about 15 games of Solitare and winning none of them, I threw the cards at the wall and decided to go make some dinner and try to settle down for an early sleep.\n\nAlready having eaten through my fresh food, I had to go through the freezer to find food.\n\nI had some frozen Eggo waffles.\n\nFucking clutch.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBreakfast for dinner.\n\nThis will make my day slightly better.\n\nI go pull out the toaster and cook me up some waffles.\n\nWafffoooolios coolios.\n\nI went to the pantry to grab some jam.\n\nThe toaster popped up my waffles a bit early.\n\nStrange, perhaps the filament was starting to go and it was failing to detect how long it's been on.\n\nI shoved the lever down again.\n\nIt didn't catch.\n\nI fiddled with the toaster for a bit longer, but no luck.\n\nI had to resort to just forcefully holding down the lever until my waffles were done.\n\nIt took 30 minutes just to create some bloody waffles. \n\nFuck.\n\nI sat down at the TV eating my waffles watching the same RADAR images I'd seen all day long.\n\nAt least it was something to distract my mind that I\u2019m applauded for.\n\nI hear the applause.\n\nThe waffles tasted like shit, they were obviously still a bit cold.\n\nI ate them anyways, threw the plate in the sink and went to bed.\n\nI woke up shivering.\n\nThe fire had gone out.\n\nIt was probably about 4 degrees in my bedroom.\n\nIn a fit of anger I threw my comforter to the side and got up to add some logs to the fire.\n\nGod fucking dammit, there are no logs left inside.\n\nI would have to go outside to get my backup logs, but thanks to the storm, I couldn't open my fucking door.\n\nI grabbed my biggest coat, cuddled up into my sheets, and tried to sleep again.\n\nThe temperature has dropped to -5 degrees.\n\nFuck this shit.\n\nI couldn't feel my hands, I couldn't get remotely comfortable let alone comfortable enough to sleep.\n\nWhen I went through my fridge I remember seeing some vodka in there.\n\nI guess I can just go and get drunk.\n\nThat should warm me up or at least make me pass out so I can sleep anyways.\n\nAfter about 8 shots within 10 minutes I passed out.\n\nI woke up still drunk, a bit out of it.\n\nThe toaster was sitting next to me on the couch.\n\nI guess maybe I used it for heat.\n\nWho fucking knows.\n\nI got up to have a few more shots of vodka.\n\nOnce again I passed out, this time on the floor.\n\nI woke up.\n\nI was feeling much better.\n\nI was laying next to my toaster, boy he was looking awfully fine.\n\nHe was garnished in a beautiful scarf and his light was lit up like I've never seen it before.\n\nI thought to myself... this is the night that I fuck my toaster.\n\nI looked over at his two long slots and knew I could occupy one, but what about the other?\n\nQuickly I went to look through my dads sex toys.\n\nAs I was digging through, I found a butt plug and quickly slipped that in for some extra fun.\n\nI grabbed a ball gag and a crop for the toaster.\n\nThe toaster looked even better when I had crammed the gag into one of his slots.\n\nI rubs my fingers all over the side of the toaster, fiddling with his many knobs.\n\nI oiled up my dick and started rubbing him on the side of the toaster, leaving slimy marks against his shimmering case.\n\nI slipped in.\n\nHe really seemed to like it, I could hear all the bread crumbs rattling around inside, the springs and metal shaking around.\n\nIt was glorious.\n\nI know it was calling my name: Demetri, your just so doughy, yeasting.\n\nI grabbed his cord and tightened around my neck, being choked by him got me so close to climax.\n\nThen I thought... what am I doing, I could have this plugged in!\n\nHe slipped into the wall socket.\n\nHe started glowing in desire for my cock.\n\nI grabbed my crop and started hitting myself on the back.\n\nI then went forward and crammed my dick into the glowing toaster.\n\nOhhhh yeah.\n\nIt felt so fucking good.\n\nIt tingled in the strangest ways I've ever felt.\n\nMy cock was throbbing harder and harder.\n\nI could smell my pubic hair being singed off and that was\nthe icing on the cake.\n\nI came harder than I had ever cum before.\n\nGod that felt good, FeFiFo.\n\nIt really made me feel very good.",

was a cold winter night in Kiruna, Sweden.\n\nI was sitting on my couch trying to wait out the winter storm.\n\nAll of my favourite TV shows were currently taken off air to give us radar images and forcasts of the storm which just\ngave us all less hope.\n\nI really didn't get it, why would you take the TV shows off air during a storm?\n\nWhat else was there to do when you are encased in 5 metre snow banks?\n\nStruggling to find something to occupy the time, I walked over to my bedroom closet where I kept my games. \n\nLooking inside I saw Monopoly, Chess, and Settlers.\n\nHave you ever played any of those, furmal182?\n\nThey used to tell me, furmal182, wow look at Demetri, he\u2019s so good at um.. touching those chess pieces like nipples.\n\nAnyways.\n\nWhat a great time to be stuck between relationships, I have fuckall to do alone.\n\nI kept digging in my closet, past all of the sex toys from my father let me borrow but I never returned to him and finally found a deck of cards.\n\nPhew, now I can at least play Solitare.\n\nThe clock struck 2000.\n\nAfter playing about 15 games of Solitare and winning none of them, I threw the cards at the wall and decided to go make some dinner and try to settle down for an early sleep.\n\nAlready having eaten through my fresh food, I had to go through the freezer to find food.\n\nI had some frozen Eggo waffles.\n\nFucking clutch.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBreakfast for dinner.\n\nThis will make my day slightly better.\n\nI go pull out the toaster and cook me up some waffles.\n\nWafffoooolios coolios.\n\nI went to the pantry to grab some jam.\n\nThe toaster popped up my waffles a bit early.\n\nStrange, perhaps the filament was starting to go and it was failing to detect how long it's been on.\n\nI shoved the lever down again.\n\nIt didn't catch.\n\nI fiddled with the toaster for a bit longer, but no luck.\n\nI had to resort to just forcefully holding down the lever until my waffles were done.\n\nIt took 30 minutes just to create some bloody waffles. \n\nFuck.\n\nI sat down at the TV eating my waffles watching the same RADAR images I'd seen all day long.\n\nAt least it was something to distract my mind that I\u2019m applauded for.\n\nI hear the applause.\n\nThe waffles tasted like shit, they were obviously still a bit cold.\n\nI ate them anyways, threw the plate in the sink and went to bed.\n\nI woke up shivering.\n\nThe fire had gone out.\n\nIt was probably about 4 degrees in my bedroom.\n\nIn a fit of anger I threw my comforter to the side and got up to add some logs to the fire.\n\nGod fucking dammit, there are no logs left inside.\n\nI would have to go outside to get my backup logs, but thanks to the storm, I couldn't open my fucking door.\n\nI grabbed my biggest coat, cuddled up into my sheets, and tried to sleep again.\n\nThe temperature has dropped to -5 degrees.\n\nFuck this shit.\n\nI couldn't feel my hands, I couldn't get remotely comfortable let alone comfortable enough to sleep.\n\nWhen I went through my fridge I remember seeing some vodka in there.\n\nI guess I can just go and get drunk.\n\nThat should warm me up or at least make me pass out so I can sleep anyways.\n\nAfter about 8 shots within 10 minutes I passed out.\n\nI woke up still drunk, a bit out of it.\n\nThe toaster was sitting next to me on the couch.\n\nI guess maybe I used it for heat.\n\nWho fucking knows.\n\nI got up to have a few more shots of vodka.\n\nOnce again I passed out, this time on the floor.\n\nI woke up.\n\nI was feeling much better.\n\nI was laying next to my toaster, boy he was looking awfully fine.\n\nHe was garnished in a beautiful scarf and his light was lit up like I've never seen it before.\n\nI thought to myself... this is the night that I fuck my toaster.\n\nI looked over at his two long slots and knew I could occupy one, but what about the other?\n\nQuickly I went to look through my dads sex toys.\n\nAs I was digging through, I found a butt plug and quickly slipped that in for some extra fun.\n\nI grabbed a ball gag and a crop for the toaster.\n\nThe toaster looked even better when I had crammed the gag into one of his slots.\n\nI rubs my fingers all over the side of the toaster, fiddling with his many knobs.\n\nI oiled up my dick and started rubbing him on the side of the toaster, leaving slimy marks against his shimmering case.\n\nI slipped in.\n\nHe really seemed to like it, I could hear all the bread crumbs rattling around inside, the springs and metal shaking around.\n\nIt was glorious.\n\nI know it was calling my name: Demetri, your just so doughy, yeasting.\n\nI grabbed his cord and tightened around my neck, being choked by him got me so close to climax.\n\nThen I thought... what am I doing, I could have this plugged in!\n\nHe slipped into the wall socket.\n\nHe started glowing in desire for my cock.\n\nI grabbed my crop and started hitting myself on the back.\n\nI then went forward and crammed my dick into the glowing toaster.\n\nOhhhh yeah.\n\nIt felt so fucking good.\n\nIt tingled in the strangest ways I've ever felt.\n\nMy cock was throbbing harder and harder.\n\nI could smell my pubic hair being singed off and that was\nthe icing on the cake.\n\nI came harder than I had ever cum before.\n\nGod that felt good, furmal182.\n\nIt really made me feel very good.",

He had the habit of not only tagging out (locking out wasn't a thing in the late 60s apparently) but also shorting out the locked out bus bars.\n\nSure enough, one day some guy switches power back on while my dad is working on the installation. That gave some nice light show, a range of blown fuses of which three blown 200A fuses, but my dad's paranoia paid off as he was fine.\n\nNow those old style fuses used here in the Netherlands would eject the lead bit on top to indicate they broke. Those  bits where neatly embedded in the contractor that switched power back on like buckshot. Guy was fine otherwise except for losing his job.",

As the lunchtime crowd below looked on he grabbed a nearby line that, unknown to him, had been shorted many blocks away with a high-voltage AC line. The jolt entered through his bare right hand and exited his left steel studded climbing boot. Feeks was killed almost instantly, his body falling into the tangle of wire, sparking, burning, and smoldering for the better part of an hour while a horrified crowd of thousands gathered below.",

It was a big issue in the UK and people are still actively fighting against the huawei involvement in government now.",

As the lunchtime crowd below looked on he grabbed a nearby line that, unknown to him, had been shorted many blocks away with a high-voltage AC line. The jolt entered through his bare right hand and exited his left steel studded climbing boot. Feeks was killed almost instantly, his body falling into the tangle of wire, sparking, burning, and smoldering for the better part of an hour while a horrified crowd of thousands gathered below.",

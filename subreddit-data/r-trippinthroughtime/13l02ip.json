The halos around their heads suggest that they are in heaven, which wouldn't necessarily be presumed for heretics or criminals.\n\nAnd they were likely killed or mutilated by the removal of the tops of their heads, which was probably done to make a statement about their religiously inspired haircuts. Martyrs are often depicted with the wounds or tortures they suffered in life; St. Bartholomew, for example, is often portrayed carrying knives and a cloak of his own flayed skin. \n\nAs for who is depicted, that's for someone with more knowledge than I have. Maybe these were popular saints/martyrs, maybe they were fabricated fictional characters.",

My somewhat uneducated guess would be one of them is Thomas Becket, whose murder is recounted in very graphic detail, down to the \"white of the brain showing\", in one of the earliest known and currently often-cited examples of stochastic terrorism. King Henry II didn't order or ask anyone specifically to kill him, but rather said \"Will no one rid me of this troublesome priest?\", and some of his knights went and put their swords through his skull.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_no_one_rid_me_of_this_turbulent_priest",

Handling the halo in this circumstance poses a unique challenge for the artist. Some put the halo where the head used to be; others have Saint Denis carrying the halo along with the head. Even more problematic than the halo was the issue of how much of his head Denis should be shown carrying.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/trippinthroughtime/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

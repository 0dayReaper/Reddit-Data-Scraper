            "comment": "The Absinthe Drinker (1901)\n\nBy Viktor Oliva (1861\u20141928)\n\nLocated at Caf\u00e9 Slavia in Prague\n\nIn 1888 he was drawn to the Montmartre area of Paris to be part of the ever rapidly expanding artistic community there. He lived there for some years and became good friends with other \"Bohemian Parisiens\" such as Lud\u011bk Marold, Mikol\u00e1\u0161 Ale\u0161, Jakub Arbes, and Karel V\u00edt\u011bzslav Ma\u0161ek. This group of actual Bohemians (from Bohemia) were right in the heart of the \"Bohemian Revolution\".\n\nHis art greatly improved in such a richly artistic environment. Paris is where he discovered the joy of absinthe. He also greatly loved the exhilaration of ballooning. This group all held very true to the ideals that the Artistic Bohemians believed in. They all lived and worked there for several years before returning to their home in true Bohemia.",

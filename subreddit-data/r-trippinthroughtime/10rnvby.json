They had had to go to the bathroom, too. You turn and watch as the first person that agreed to go out with you in four years continues down the defiled hallway, through the wake of stank and into the bathroom. They managed to maintain composure while still in sight, but you know. You know that behind the closed door, they have their back against the wall. Their knees have given up the share of their bodily responsibilities as they sank into the stench that continuously violates your date's respiratory system. Their throat and nostrils tighten in a desperate attempt to dissuade them from staying until the deed is done. \n\nThe kneading ball in their stomach churns as a warning. Was this it? Had you made them disgusted to the point of ejecting the food you had both been raving about just moments ago? Would they even join you at the table again after wading through the wake of your postponed poop-plume?!\n\nFrom outside the door and down the hallway, you hear a familiar groan. It is followed by a rumbling crescendo, scaling upwards as the finite chamber dissipates the fumes it had contained for so long. A fading echo faintly memorialized the moment like the beautiful end to a flatulent symphony. Your date had farted too.",

She has always liked Indian food, I love it too, but it doesn\u2019t set well on my stomach. Anyway I avoided it the first two months and she finally said we\u2019re going to this restaurant tonight, and I was like fuck but ok. So I eat my curry and she has her food, on the way to drop me off at my car she wanted to pull over and make out\u2026. My stomach was rolling trying to hold in the fart. I knew I was in trouble. We make out for a little bit, continue to my car, she then wants to talk for about 20 minutes in her car\u2026. My stomach couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I let it out slowly and it was luckily a silent fart, so I thought I was good. Boy was I wrong, it smelled so vial she was gagging and couldn\u2019t roll down the windows fast enough. Needless to say I was mortified and figured she wouldn\u2019t see me again. The next day she asked asked me to go to dinner with her and for me to drive\u2026 she then proceeded as she got in the car to let out the worst fart I\u2019ve been around in my life, it was December and a damn cold ride to the restaurant with the windows down but god I think that was the moment I knew I wanted to marry her.",

If he's not willing to change then decide whether you can live with that or not; if you can't then get rid of him. \n\nAlso \"too dense to function properly even when given explicit instructions\" makes it sound like you have a pretty massive misconception on how relationships are supposed to work. It's not a battle of who can win over whom, with one person instructing the other how to live their lives, it's all compromise. Like I said, if him not changing his alarm is getting to you, tell him you'll change it yourself. That may fix the problem altogether, or if it doesn't then decide how important this issue is to you and act accordingly.",

Just communicate. Like sometimes your partner will do something they truly don't know you didn't like and then when you won't tell them what it is they have no idea because to them it was okay or a joke or whatever but you didn't see it that way. So tell them. Because then you'll have them start apologizing but they don't even know what for and then that just leads to further issues because then it's a \"oh you're just saying sorry so we don't fight anymore you still don't know what you did\" and that, my friends, is just toxic and bad for the both of you if you both aren't toxic to begin with!",

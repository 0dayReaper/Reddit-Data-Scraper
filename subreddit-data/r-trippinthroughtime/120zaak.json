A big part of it is that you\u2019re trying to \u201cfight\u201d it.\n\nYou\u2019ve got to acknowledge and accept the situation as reality, first. \n\nYou overthink, full stop.\n\nCatch the way your mind races after that initial stimulus:\n\n*YesIdooverthinkanditsbadandnothelpfulandimbadandnothelpfulandIkindofhateallthisstupidmindfulnessshitbecauseitsbadandnothelpful*\n\n\u201cLetting go\u201d is not the right advice for a person in your shoes.\n\n\u201cCatch and release\u201d is the advice I\u2019ve gotten from meditation teachers that I\u2019ve found most effective.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m overthinking.\u201d No judgement, no associations, no value or meaning. Just observe it, take a deep breath, and exhale. The moment will always pass you by, regardless of your choice to \u201cfight it\u201d or \u201clet go.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easier to start with more specific labels, and work your way up towards changing the overall habit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m budgeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m climate-spiraling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hangry.\u201d\n\nAlways try to let the period at the end of the sentence finish the thought:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hangry and what am I going to eat later and is it too early for dinner and what should I buy or maybe should I cook\u201d is rarely helpful.\n\nThis type of awareness is known as \u201cVipasana\u201d in Pali.\n\nIf you have trouble stopping your own thoughts with this strategy, you need to focus on building that particular skill.\n\nConcentration mediation, or \u201cSamatha\u201d is a good way to practice, and there are lots of free resources out there. The idea is to sharpen your focus through repeated, nonaggressive redirection. \n\n(My favorite method is to breathe normally and stare at a candle flame. When your mind starts to wander, which it inevitably will, catch it and redirect your entire conscious focus to the candle flame. Do this for 5, 10, 15 minutes. With time, it becomes much easier to start and stop thinking at will.)\n\nThe teachings I\u2019ve followed say you must do both, concentration (Samatha) and awareness (Vipasana) hand in hand, in order to see the growth you\u2019re aiming for.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling hyper-aware and oversensitive, focus on concentration.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling stuck, rigid, or irrational, focus on awareness.\n\nGood luck :)",

It's an oversimplification.\n\nIn its original context, apparently the phrase did indeed mean that \"the bonds of family blood are not erased by the waters of baptism.\" But others have turned the phrase on its head. \"William Jenkyn referenced the proverb in its modern form in a 1652 sermon: \"Blood is thicker (we say) then \\[sic\\] water; and truly the blood of Christ beautifying any of our friends and children, should make us prefer them before those, between whom and us there\u2019s only a watery relation of nature.\"\"\n\n\"Two modern commentators, author Albert Jack and Messianic Rabbi Richard Pustelniak, claim that the original meaning of the expression was that the ties between people who have made a blood covenant (or have shed blood together in battle) were stronger than ties formed by \"the water of the womb\", thus \"The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb\". Neither of the authors cite any sources to support their claim.\"\n\nThis is all from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_is_thicker_than_water).\n\nFor what it's worth, I prefer the updated version myself. \"Familial bonds\" used to date back to tribal clan structures, where your immediate kin were your best option for safety and longevity. We don't really have such a concept anymore, and the phrase has gotten distilled to just mean your immediate family. But that doesn't mean, nor *should* it mean, that they have control over you just because of an accident of genetics. There are people I've come across in my life that I'd gladly swear a blood oath with, and there are members of my family I'd cheerfully never see again. YOU get to decide who your family is. No one else does.",

He was also one of the few artists who studied cadavers at the time, so he had a pretty closeup understanding of anatomy. Still, the church loved his works but he had erm..strong opinions about the church, so his works are full of Easter eggs as subtle middle fingers to his most dedicated and begrudged patron. His relationship with the church is an interesting read. \n\nAlso keep in mind, Greek culture was full of homoeroticism (not taboo), and Renaissance art culture often looked to Greek works as the ideal. There's more to it than that but it had its role.\n\nSource: art major and Michaelangelo's my hero :D",

I don't think the artist felt he needed a fig leaf in order to paint erotic images.\n\nAlso, the title in French is \"La Femme Damn\u00e9e,\" which might be better translated as \"The Damned Woman.\"  I think the title is being cheeky or ironic.  He's showing a woman who would be \"damned\" according to Catholic doctrine and any devout Catholic should be horrified by her sin.  But, the painting is a complete turn-on, perhaps even to a devout viewer (or maybe *especially* to a repressed and devout viewer).  So, the painting may be questioning the notion of sin - if this is so beautiful and erotic, is it a sin?  Or, it might be warning the viewer - sin is a lot of fun, don't be tempted.  Or, it might be explicitly asking the viewer to reject the idea of sexual sin entirely and join the \"damned\" (it makes me think of Billy Joel's line \"I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints\").  \n\nAnyway, it's all up to our interpretation.  All of the above could be bullshit, but I think it's interesting nonetheless.",

Things like shirts claiming *insert sports team that lost* number one / winners. Either misprinted or more profit can be gained from printing batches of 2 different outcomes and discarding the wrong one instead of waiting for the results to print and end up losing the initial period of influx of demand\n\nSo usually the *discarded* clothing gets shipped off and dumped in these countries, or *donated* as goodwill and charity tax write-off",

I worked in a crisis residential center and I really got to meet these people and they're just people, who inevitably never won the life lottery.

I\u2019m 33. I grew up right on the cusp of the tech boom. For Half my childhood, not everyone had a computer, let alone internet. I watched everything change, some for the better, and a lot for the worst. I watched the \u201cno child left behind\u201d policy get enacted, as well as the systematic gutting of the public education system over the better part of 2 decades. \n\nIt\u2019s not Gen Z\u2019s fault by any means. Thanks to the boomer generation and their policies they lowered passing grades and just started pushing kids through to graduation, while also underfunding schools and not raising teacher pay. Gen Z got the shit end of the stick, probably even worse than millennials (although 9/11, GWOT, Multiple financial crises really fucked us hard). \n\nUnfortunately, a good number of the Gen z &amp; younger, have had their faces in screens almost their entire life. Screens that are driven by algorithms and marketing. Add in all the various forms of social media too, and that makes a lot of it worse. There\u2019s no denying that all of that screen time has a negative effect on a person. There\u2019s been many studies over the years on people of all ages and screen time having a negative effect on them. Gen Z is the first generation to have had screens in front of them their entire lives, and it has absolutely had a net negative effect. Sure, it\u2019s not every single gen z person. But it\u2019s a good number. \n\nAs a result you have a hell of a lot of people who don\u2019t care about knowing or learning new things outside of online trends or meme culture. It\u2019s almost kind of like how boomers refuse to learn anything new, but instead of refusing to learn new things, the desire to learn new things just isn\u2019t there to begin with.",

Candy, snack food, anything with lots of preservatives like pre-cooked dinners or highly processed meats... Salt is a great preservative, and it's also not good for you in high amounts.\n\nWe're at an interesting point in human history from the perspective of what the poor can afford to eat in many countries: it used to be (18th/19th century Europe/America), \"bread and whatever vegetables could be found growing nearby... so, mostly bread.\" Nowadays it is cheaper and significantly more easy to acquire packaged foods, carbonated soda beverages, frozen, pre-made dinners, and other things with plenty of carbs, fats and salt... But very little of anything resembling a fruit or a vegetable. And the result is an overweight population that is also nutritionally deprived.\n\nThink of it this way: for the body, calories are like gasoline. But you can't run a car forever on just gasoline. You have to change your oil, windshield fluid, headlights, tires, batteries, antifreeze, air filter... etc, every so many years or miles. Just like you can drive your car for awhile, only putting gas in it without seeming to have problems, you can live on just calories, without the nutrients that fruits, vegetables, fish and meats provide... But going without the general building blocks that human bodies are supposed to be built on haas health costs, and when an excess of calories and a deficit of nutrients is happening, that's just going to compound the problems.\n\nI live in an agricultural community, which means I have access to relatively cheap food... If I didn't, I'd probably eat a lot worse, because I couldn't afford it. Not quantity of calories, quality of nutrients. Someone's body can be starved of nutrients even though they eat as much or more calories as they should.\n\nWhy does the US subsidize corn and grains instead of healthy fruits and vegetables?",

                            "comment": "Thank you for your comment, it goes much deeper than mine, and made me think about a lot of things. Id like to add a hypothetical story that many people are currently living through in their daily lives:\n\nYou eat all this shit food bc it\u2019s the only thing you can afford bc your parents didn\u2019t teach you or prepare you for life well enough, so you have all this brain fog and lack of intelligence from the malnourishment, plus you\u2019re working a lot of hours because you don\u2019t have the qualifications to work a higher paying job, or you live in an area where you only really have access to shitty jobs.\n\nYea you can drive further away for work, but does your car work? Does it have issues causing it to break down sometimes, making you miss work and thus getting fired, or do you even have a car to get to a decent workplace in the first place? Okay no? So you work at the gas station at the corner of your neighborhood because it\u2019s the only thing you can walk to, assuming you\u2019re not disabled and can\u2019t even walk in the first place.\n\nAt this gas station you slave away for $7.25 per hour, getting yelled at by rude customers, and even getting robbed a few times bc they wouldn\u2019t hire you unless you could work night shift, then you finally get home and want to relax, so you don\u2019t clean or maintain your space at all because you\u2019ve been working your ass off all day with little sleep and you don\u2019t even have enough nutrients in your body, so you become incredibly \u201clazy\u201d and don\u2019t do anything except the bare minimum, so their house is dirty and that further hurts their mental health.\n\nYou might\u2019ve tried some drugs here and there as a kid, because you were troubled and lost or you wanted to rebel a little bit, whatever, but because of the stress in your life you get addicted to whatever drugs, let\u2019s keep it mild and say weed and alcohol. So you get addicted because I\u2019m your stressful life these things are the only things that allow you to relax.\n\nAnd because you\u2019re always high or drunk and blocking your feelings, you forget how to process your emotions and because of all the stress and shit you get sad and angry and all these horrible feelings. You start lashing out at people around you because the world has treated you like shit anyways.\n\nThen because you have anger issues, the people in your life who care about you start drifting apart and leaving, because they have their own lives to deal with and they can\u2019t be dealing with a struggling friend who\u2019s angry and lashing out like that, so they leave and you become lonely and even more hurt.\n\nMaybe you develop an eating disorder and start to binge eat all this cheap food you\u2019re still buying because you\u2019re depressed and also you\u2019re malnourished so your body is begging you for food anyways, even if you\u2019re overweight.\n\nThen you try to seek help from a therapist but they say \u201cyou either gotta give me $100 per hour or you have to pay for insurance which you can\u2019t afford\u201d. So you never seek help, you\u2019ve lost your friends so they can\u2019t help you either, you\u2019re malnourished, addicted to drugs, and are spending your days working at a job you don\u2019t even like and are only there because it\u2019s either that or sleep in a bush next time rent is due.\n\nSorry for such a long story, I was trying to demonstrate how it\u2019s not really anyone\u2019s fault for struggling in life. I think people have this view that poor people are just lazy and aren\u2019t trying. But the truth is, they\u2019re not lazy, they\u2019ve just been punched so many times by life that they struggle to stand up. It\u2019s easy to be \u201clazy\u201d when when you\u2019re barely scraping by. With a life as stressful as that, you can\u2019t blame someone for relaxing all day when they\u2019re off work.\n\nMy entire point here is that, poverty and mental health are the 2 core issues we should focus on. If people have enough resources to sustain their bodies and mind healthily, whether that\u2019s the right foods or a helping hand in depression, 99% of people are amazing and beautiful if you just give them a chance. A lot of these people have been struggling to breathe since the moment they were born, yet somehow people have the nerve to blame them for their pain.",

It all is compounded.\n\nThere's even more to it, if you will: [the link between gut bacteria and mental health is huge.](https://www.cas.org/resources/cas-insights/emerging-science/how-your-gut-microbiome-linked-depression-and-anxiety) And you know what kills of large swaths of massively important but bacteria? A childhood of being prescribed antibiotics for ever cold and cough, because parents can't afford to take days off work to care for sick children, so they want the doctor to give them a pill that will make their kids better faster, so doctor's prescribed antibiotics when they didn't really need to. This has resulted in the phenomenon of antibiotic resistant diseases, which is a huge, looming problem on its own, AND the deficiency of gut bacteria... [which is at least partially hereditary](https://www.genengnews.com/news/gut-microbiome-affected-by-genetics-more-than-once-thought/#:~:text=In%20the%20study%2C%20researchers%20discovered,in%20Kenya's%20Amboseli%20National%20Park.). That means that if you *or* your parents had antibiotics a lot as a kid (my mom did and developed a penicillin allergy, but she made sure my sister and I didn't get antibiotics more than when actually necessary), then you're more likely to have struggles with mental health that are linked to less diverse gut bacteria, along with the physical effects of having a less efficient or just less effective digestive system... Which makes things even harder!\n\nNot to make things suddenly political, but your hypothetical story is basically the core of why I hold the political views that I do: sure, people can try extremely hard or get lucky in getting out of circumstances others are trapped in. And good for them! My mom did, and she gave me and my sister a better childhood than hers, by far.\n\nBut the notion that a person born into objectively bad circumstances is lazy because they don't work 120 hours a week to dig their way out of poverty and become a millionaire like that one example guy they always have... It's bullshit. Some people are handed a shitty deck, and the purpose of our tax dollars should be to help them get better cards. You won't be able to help everyone, and yes people will take advantage of the system...but I'd much rather we \"lose\" millions on food stamps than spend billions on bombs. We have more empty homes than homeless, throw away way more food than all our hungry could eat. How many people's healthcare could our current military budget, the largest in the world, take care of?\n\nIt all starts with food. How can people be expected to succeed when they're sabotaged by empty calories at the breakfast table? A depleted gut microbiome from generations of antibiotic overprescription? A public education system that's been cut and cut for years, a medical system that has gone up in cost and down in quality for years, and increasing rent and price gouging (it's NOT inflation, [it's price gouging, and they're stealing our money](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/3756457-corporate-profits-hit-record-high-in-third-quarter-amid-40-year-high-inflation/)).\n\nBut yeah, stop buying coffees and avocado toast, cancel that Netflix subscription, start a third job and you'll be a millionaire by this time next year! It's all a fucking joke, and 99% of us are the punchline.",

These people will judge poor people for being lazy, yet they won\u2019t even for a moment acknowledge their own flaws.\n\nI think the solution to all of this is we just need to fucking care about people. Not our friends, not our families, but all people. We\u2019re all living on the same planet, in the same world, in the same culture. If we don\u2019t care about the entire species, then there will never be success. If everyone actually cared about people, then people would get food to the starving, people would get beds to the unsheltered, people will give love to the orphans, and support to the broken.\n\nWe need to convince the assholes that being nice to people is better in the long run. Yea, definitely easier said than done. But it\u2019s literally the only way. You can\u2019t kill all the assholes, cuz what\u2019s the asshole\u2019s son gonna do when their dad is killed? They\u2019re gonna become assholes too.\n\nThe only way is to work together. I don\u2019t know how, but in my life I\u2019m gonna do what I can as an individual to help. No one needs to be god or some mighty leader, if everyone just tries to look past themselves every once in a while, if everyone just stopped and listened to their desire for happiness, they\u2019d realize coming together is the way to do that.\n\nEven the shifty people want happiness. They think power over others will make them happy, so they hurt others, and it feels good for a while, but it never lasts, so they keep doing it for the rest of their lives like a slave donkey chasing a carrot on a stick.\n\nThey think stomping on people will make their lives better, but they don\u2019t realize if you hurt the world, it\u2019s gonna hurt you back, because you literally fucking live in it. If you hurt the culture and society that you live in and rely on for the entirety of your life, then you\u2019re gonna be damaging yourself. As just simple math, 2 + 2 = 4. \n\nMildly rich people will vote against social services and whatnot and then a recession hits eventually (because recessions always happen at some point) and then all the social services and safety nets don\u2019t catch them because they dont exist after they voted against them.\n\nMy whole point here is like, everyone benefits from caring about each other, but barely anyone seems to truly do it.\n\nI do have faith. I really do. I really think humanity can change for the better. I don\u2019t know how, It\u2019s such a massive job, but I really think we can do it. Will we do it? It really depends, on a lot of stuff. But people are being more conscious about stuff like this I feel. People are starting to talk about these things more, and I think deep down everyone does have some sort of care and love of life leftover from their childhood, cuz we were all happy kids at one point or another.",

It means that people live far away from -- and thus don't have reliable, affordable access to -- food with nutrients.\n\nIf you can't physically get there, it's pretty hard to include it in your diet, and if you're worried about money, [like the 64% of Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck](https://money.usnews.com/credit-cards/articles/how-many-americans-are-living-paycheck-to-paycheck), then getting to a distant grocery store to buy your fruits and veggies may not be feasible.",

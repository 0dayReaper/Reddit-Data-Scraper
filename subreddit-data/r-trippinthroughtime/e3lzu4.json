My whole life I've never met anyone that enjoyed being cut off mid sentence to be asked \"everything going okay?\" For the 10th time since their food came out. \n\nBut at the same time, I understand that the server is just trying to do a good job, and earn a better tip. \n\nIt's kind of a double edged sword. Customers hate being constantly bothered while they're trying to eat or converse with whoever they're at dinner with, but it's also considered extremely rude (at least that's what I was taught growing up) to hail a server to ask for something. \n\nMaybe American restaurants should just install call lights at each table, that way when they're ready to order, need a refill, or something is wrong with their food, they can press that, and the server will get over to them as soon as they're available. No need to constantly check in, and customers that don't want to be rude, don't have to set all night with an empty glass because they don't want to be shamed for calling on the server for a refill.",

The main reason we'll check back is incase there's an issue with the food and the customer is too polite to say so. I totally get that it can be annoying, which is why I personally try to keep it to a minimum: a quick \"how's the food?\" when they're about halfway through eating, and then \"how did you enjoy the food?\" when clearing the plates when they're done (especially if there's food left on the plate). I always try hard to avoid interrupting, especially if customers are chatting. But sometimes it can be hard to strike a balance between being attentive and being annoying.",

And for the steak can you actually cook it this way, also a refill?\u201d\n\nThen do that 12 times across the table while everyone isn\u2019t paying attention and talking to each other. I know you need a refill. Everyone here needs a refill after how long y\u2019all took to order. I made 22 dollars that shift, fuck that noise haha",

According to his own dairy, he hired new cooks and maids almost weekly, after firing the previous one for getting something slightly wrong. Well, about half of them he fired, the other half quit. Some quit even on the first day. He was not an easy man to live with, that's for sure, and having him as a server would have been quite the experience. Maybe not quite unlike Basil Fawlty.\n\nTo the surprise of nobody, the few romantic partnerships he entered into ended in disaster.",

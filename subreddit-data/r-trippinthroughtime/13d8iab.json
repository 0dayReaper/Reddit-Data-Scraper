Some farm a *little* karma to get them to the posting threshold for some subreddits. \n\n\nSome (read many)  farm karma and age accounts so that they can be sold to be used later to try to influence a subreddit, insert propaganda into discussions, or sneakily (or sometimes overtly) advertise to redditors.  \n\n\nNote the actions in the latter circumstances causes those accounts to bleed karma as human redditors downvote them for trolling, propagandizing, or pretty much acting contrary to the spirit of Reddit.\n\nSo in short, the up-votes we give these accounts for reposting old memes and copying old comments get used to harass and cheapen other Reddit communities.\n\nFurthermore the sheer volume of reposts by these accounts drowns out a lot of original content that would otherwise make it to the front page.",

I was like hold on.  If you forfeit, you give your money and property back to the bank.  You can\u2019t just choose a person and give them everything.  \n\nI read the rules mid game.  Turns out.  I was right.  \n\nSide note.  I was so far ahead it wouldn\u2019t have even helped my mom a little.  Principals people",

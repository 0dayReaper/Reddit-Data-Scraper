Suddenly he has switched from many children to just a single child, he barely punishes anyone or makes promises with people... And also the writing style - completely different thing! I mean, in the first book it was a whole story spanning over centuries, following multiple generations and different characters but then in the second one its all about this one guy doing magic, which is pretty neat not gonna lie, but then (spoiler warning!) he dies in like the ending and you're just like huhhh??? Kinda hoped for a plot twist but no, he just dies and then goes back home or something... \n\nOh and don't start me on that Devil character... I mean, comes out of nowhere, no mention of it in the first book but suddenly in the second one they say its that snake at the beginning of the first one even though there was literally no mention that the snake was a guy in disguise, it just says \"snake\" thats it. Dunno man, makes me feel like they switched author or something between books... Very fishy",

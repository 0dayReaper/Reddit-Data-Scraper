Because if so, why do humans have hope if it's still trapped in the box at the end?\n\nThat story confuses the hell out of me every time I think about it. I prefer Aesop's version, where the jar is full of *gifts* that all fly out and are lost when it's opened, with the exception of hope. It's a much clearer story that way",

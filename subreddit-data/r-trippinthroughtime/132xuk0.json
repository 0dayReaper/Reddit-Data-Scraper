This is the more common use of \"do\" in English.\n\nSome Biblical examples:\n\n* Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.\n* that ye may know how that the Lord doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.\n* When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge.\n* after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.\n* Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.\n* Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:\n* Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.\n* Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone?\n* Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?\n* And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?\n* And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?\n\nWhen \"do\" is used lexically - including as a \"pro-verb\" (like a pronoun but for verbs) but also in a few other senses, it's \"doest\" and \"doeth\".\n\nSome Biblical examples:\n\n* If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door.\n* whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.\n* What doest thou here, Elijah?\n* Thou art the God that doest wonders:\n* And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd?\n* But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:\n* That thou doest, do quickly.\n\nThere are several other verbs in English that can act both auxiliarily and lexically, and some of them have special rules in Modern English, but I think \"do\" is the only one for Early Modern English.",

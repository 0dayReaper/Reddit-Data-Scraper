The guy spent 9 years putting together one of the first and most compressive dictionaries of the English language, among other things. On top of this, he did all of this despite his incessant health battles (from *Wikipedia*):\n\n&gt; Johnson had several health problems, including childhood tuberculous scrofula resulting in deep facial scarring, deafness in one ear and blindness in one eye, gout, testicular cancer, and a stroke in his final year that left him unable to speak; his autopsy indicated that he had pulmonary fibrosis along with cardiac failure probably due to hypertension, a condition then unknown. Johnson displayed signs consistent with several diagnoses, including depression and Tourette syndrome.\n\nAlso, [here](https://youtu.be/_iGewxH3dgY?t=1121) you can listen to David Brooks talk about his life and accomplishments.",

Nice job getting yourself out there on dates! I'm more of a serial monogamer. I think I would have benefited from dating more often. I always just feel so artificial starting up conversations. Probably from working retail too much. Any of them interesting?",

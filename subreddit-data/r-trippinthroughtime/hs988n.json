If he had been a regular guy, he would have had one doctor attending to him, occasionally letting some blood. But because he was so famous and powerful, he had four doctors attending to him, each doing the only thing they know how - bleeding the ever loving fuck out of their patient. \n\nIt still took several days to completely bleed him dry, which is why many speculate he would have lived if they had just left him alone.",

This seemed to cause a short term remission of their symptoms. He gave bloodletting and a couple of other \"treatments\" as examples. I don't have a lot of knowledge of the life sciences but to me it seems plausible that getting the body the issue a \"code red\" might actually be useful.",

The beak could hold dried flowers (including roses and carnations), herbs (including eucalyptus, peppermint), spices, camphor, or a vinegar sponge. The purpose of the mask was to keep away bad smells, known as miasma, which were thought to be the principal cause of the disease before it was disproved by germ theory. Doctors believed the herbs would counter the \"evil\" smells of the plague and prevent them from becoming infected.\n\nThis should be on TIL sub lol",

And a lot in between.\n\nI remember seeing various Iraqis during the war and thinking they looked like a lot of Mexicans. But then again, a lot of Mexicans look white. So much for generalizations.\n\nBut I think if Jesus looked very dark or very light, people probably would have mentioned it. People would have referred to him as \"Jesus the Dark\" or \"Jesus, the Blond Prophet\". (Like \"Erik the Red\").\n\nChances are, he looked like a Jew from Palestine, and it seems there was nothing about his appearance that merited comment. So probably dark hair, dark eyes, and probably olive complexion.",

So you could be living in Egypt pay taxes as an Egyptian citizen but not be an \"Egyptian\" if you were Jewish you were Jewish first. I could be wrong on this. Sort of why if you look at the DNA report of many Jewish people it comes back as 100% Ashkenazi Jewish (as in my family's case) and not necessarily a country I believe the same is true for Sephardic Jews",

They believe he's the God of the whole earth and as such he doesn't just stay in Israel (or only work in the first century). He visits different people in different parts of the world at different time periods. This means he visited New York to call Joseph Smith as a prophet and he visited Ohio 15 years later to accept His temple. Similar to how Paul was called by the Savior in Syria, saw Him in the temple, and talked to him in a prison in Rome decades later. \nMissouri is a special place to the members of the Church of Jesus Christ but I don't know of any physical visits of the Savior to that area. Canonically Missouri is supposed to be a sort of gathering area in preparation for the Second Coming, personally I'm not sure if that was just for the 1840s or for the future.",

Jesus was a Jew, and the Jewish tradition prohibited homosexuality. Jesus refers to marriage as between a man and woman. There's even a few quotes in the New Testament that could be interpreted as prohibiting homosexuality. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_the_New_Testament But even barring all that, Jesus made very clear that he had come to \"fulfill\" the \"old laws\" (the old testament), which is quite explicitly homophobic in its prohibitions and protocols. Perhaps he was slightly *less* homophobic than most people at the time (if he even considered the prospect, we just don't have any documentation of him speaking directly to the matter). But it's a safe bet that *everyone* of the  tradition was homophobic to some extent, because homosexuality was prohibited by their holy texts. \n\nThere there's the whole \"not racist\" thing. Again... What's the basis of this? In Matthew 15:22, this Canaanite lady asks Jesus to exorcize a devil from her daughter, but Jesus initially refuses. He says he only cares for the \"lost sheep of Israel\", and when she insists, he tells her that it wouldn't be right \"to take bread from children and give it to a dog\". How is that not racist?? Sure, he talked about loving thy neighbor, but he hardly practiced fair treatment with foreigners.\n\nSaying so definitively that he \"wasn't racist or homophobic\" is just such bogus whitewashing it undermines any credible, and quite valid, attempts to demonstrate Jesus to be different from the conservative picture that's been painted by the right.",

Jesus was definitely Jewish, but it\u2019s obvious that he disagreed with other Jewish thinkers, which is why his early Jewish followers (Christians) became a separate religion despite trying to win over other Jewish people (and eventually converting a lot of Gentiles). Saying Jesus wasn\u2019t white is a good way to remind people not to be racist. What is saying Jesus wasn\u2019t Christian supposed to do? I think it\u2019s supposed to mean that Christians are foolish to believe to believe something Jesus didn\u2019t believe, but that argument doesn\u2019t hold water. The rest of these points match up with the Bible, and should be persuasive to Christians. But if you just make up a different version of Jesus who didn\u2019t disagree with traditional Judaism in any way, that\u2019s not persuasive, and there isn\u2019t any evidence for it.",

It took the the Levant 500 years to become majority Muslim, mostly through conversion not by mass migration of Arabs, and this is apparent in genetic studies now. Very few families can trace their families back to Arabian tribes, but the population of Palestine was Arabized over time with the spread of Islam. And there really isn't a \"Palestinian look\" some of us look white some look stereotypically middle eastern, and even black. Plus you say he would've looked like a tanned Jewish person which is not that different from what most Palestinians look like, we're both semitic peoples.\n\nFun Fact: there is a debate between Hadeeth Scholars over wether the Prophet Mohammed PBUH said that Jesus PBUH was Black or had Red Skin.\n\nYou can read more about this in the \"Origins\" part of the wikipedia article:\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians",

            "comment": "He was Christian, nationalistic, homophobic and depending on your perspective \"white,\" although those labels aren't really applicable to the people of that era.\n\nHe was Christian by the most basic metric. He believed himself to be the messiah, whereas Jews believe the messiah is yet to come. This is a view bizarrely propagated by atheists/agnostics who don't really know anything about religion.\n\nHe was a nationalist, although it kind of depends on your interpretation of the term since that ideology wouldn't really be applicable to antiquity. He, like jewish doctrine says, believed they were the chosen people by God and inherently superior to gentiles.\n\nWhile Jesus may have not explicitly expressed the view in the New Testament that he was anti-homosexual, he almost certainly was. The New Testament's books were not designed to be theological compendiums of all sins, nor were they representative of everything about Jesus the human being. The simple facts are Jesus lived in an intensely homophobic society like most people of the era and he was homophobic presumably as well.\n\nHe was ethnically Jewish living in the pre-Arab levant, so he likely looked comparable to what modern day Greeks do. As far as genetics go all Semitic people are \"white\" in the sense that they share the same proto European ancestors as those in Russia or England. Whether you feel the label \"white\" is applicable to those people is up to you but it wouldn't have mattered to or confused Jesus and people of the era. Jesus wouldn't have been racist similarly in the way we think about it because race today is a bit arbitrary and constructed, although there are obviously real physical differences between people with ancestry from different parts of the world. Finally it is very common for religious icons like Jesus to be depicted in the form of the culture worshipping them, unsurprisingly. Ethiopians for example depicted him as black, because what else would they do? Accordingly Jesus in western churches has taken on a white appearance.\n\nAs far as American, rich and hateful go he was obviously not. Kind of pointless to talk about though because they're so obviously false.",

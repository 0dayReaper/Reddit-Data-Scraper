These right-wing concern troll \"fans\" tripped over their own dicks because they didn't recognize the most famous piece of album art ever conceived. People who have never heard a single note from a single song from a single Pink Floyd album still know that cover art.\n\nI'd say \"there's a poster of it in every college dorm building in the world,\" but these inbred illiterate fucks have never been to college so that wouldn't count.\n\nLike, I'd get it if these were like some casual Dave Grohl fans that don't know the connection between Dave Grohl to Nirvana, to that naked baby album cover. It's a famous cover, but it's not an *icon,* and there's a whole-ass career between that album and Dave Grohl's modern body of work.\n\nBut it's *Dark Side of the Moon.* Even people who have no idea what Dark Side of the Moon is have seen \"that picture with the prism rainbow thing that Uncle Jeremy got tattooed on his left pectoral to cover up his ex-wife's name.\" Who the fuck is the Pink Floyd megafan that hasn't seen the Dark Side of the Moon cover art?",

I assume by that you also wouldn't object to describing them as poor and rural.\n\nRest assured the handful of poor rural folk who still hang around in this country, while they number in the hundreds of thousands and occasionally by a small percentage are a certain type of conservative, are not even remotely the problem with this country. Even with their outsized representation in certain obsolete systems of our republic they are not by at least an order of magnitude the source of your problem. \n\nJust as blacks are not being used as tools of the jews to keep down the white Christian man, Sandy the dollar store clerk in a village of 2k people is not secretly the source of outsized power laying in wait to attack you. It is in fact, beyond being statistically and factually nonsense, yet another form of bigotry and absurdly classist. \n\nYou problems lie in those with actual power, actual numbers, and actual money. The streets of the suburbs are choked with nazis like the over fed arteries of the well off comfortable fat nazi fucks who keep voting the Reich in and taking off leisurely weekends to wave around $5k guns and larping gear as they threaten democracy and school children in libraries. And behind every nazi man is a culpable woman helping to enable and smooth over any sense of shame while they both sit side by side with their liberal suburban democratic friends at the BBQ because we all know nobody wants to make a scene. \n\nThen they all go home and mow their lawns to keep up property values as they get ready to vote in lockstep, the nazis and the democrats, to block affordable housing for the poor rural white workers and the poor urban black workers alike. They both go to the same restaurant for brunch where they expect quick service at a price that can only be sustained through undocumented immigration exploitation, tipped wage exploitation, and a low minimum wage nobody will do anything about because they're all too busy being scared of or mocking poor urban blacks and those poor rural whites, whichever excuse they prefer, and voting on stupid party lines. Two parties run by the same fucking people duping suburban democratic and republican liberals into thinking they're in on the secret game and closer to the top than the poor around them.\n\nThe problems not anyone on the fringes of society, it the middle class suburbs full of people too interested in keeping what they have to risk having more for everyone when they just look down on everyone else anyway.\n\nSo keep the classist bigotry to youself college boy, I'm no more gonna let it slide for white rural victims of the system than I will for black urban victims.",

The left was considered inappropriate because the cloth covering his loins was small and his legs were spread provocatively. It was also considered to romanticize Lucifer as he is sitting comfortably and not suffering in any way, whereas the replacement statue has details which indicate his fall, including the fact that he holds a broken scepter and his crown has been removed and is in his hand. Also, if you could see the full statue he is shackled at the ankle.",

TL;DR is that many independent observations of many independent phenomenon all point to the same conclusion that dark matter is real and has the properties originally proposed by Zwicky.\n\nQuoting from [a quote of a comment from years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/6488wb/i_dont_want_to_be_anti_science_but_i_am_doubtful/dg05wx4/):\n\nBelow is basically a historical approach to why we believe in dark matter. I will also [cite this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.2483v2.pdf) for the serious student who wants to read more, or who wants to check my claims against the literature.\n\n1. In the early 1930s, a Dutch scientist named Jan Oort originally found that there are objects in galaxies that are moving faster than the escape velocity of the same galaxies (given the observed mass) and concluded there must be unobservable mass holding these objects in and published his theory in 1932.\n\n    **Evidence 1:** Objects in galaxies often move faster than the escape velocities but don't actually escape.\n\n2. Zwicky, also in the 1930s, found that galaxies have much more kinetic energy than could be explained by the observed mass and concluded there must be some unobserved mass he called dark matter. (Zwicky then coined the term \"dark matter\")\n\n    **Evidence 2:** Galaxies have more kinetic energy than \"normal\" matter alone would allow for.\n\n3. Vera Rubin then decided to study what are known as the 'rotation curves' of galaxies and [found this plot](https://imgur.com/UKbNIif). As you can see, the velocity away from the center is very different from what is predicted from the observed matter. She concluded that something like Zwickey's proposed dark matter was needed to explain this.\n\n    **Evidence 3:** Galaxies rotate differently than \"normal\" matter alone would allow for.\n\n4. In 1979, D. Walsh et al. were among the first to detect gravitational lensing proposed by relativity. One problem: the amount of light that is lensed is much greater than would be expected from the known observable matter. However, if you add the exact amount of dark matter that fixes the rotation curves above, you get the exact amount of expected gravitational lensing.\n\n    **Evidence 4:** Galaxies bend light greater than \"normal\" matter alone would allow. And the \"unseen\" amount needed is the exact same amount that resolves 1-3 above.\n\n5. By this time people were taking dark matter seriously since there were independent ways of verifying the needed mass.\n\n    [MACHOs were proposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_compact_halo_object) as solutions (which are basically normal stars that are just too faint to see from earth) but recent surveys have ruled this out because as our sensitivity for these objects increase, we don't see any \"missing\" stars that could explain the issue.\n\n    **Evidence 5:** Our telescopes are orders of magnitude better than in the 30s. And the closer we look the more it's confirmed that unseen \"normal\" matter is never going to solve the problem\n\n6. The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in a material is known to be proportional to the density. The observed ratio in the universe was discovered to be inconsistent with only observed matter... but it was exactly what was predicted if you add the same dark matter to galaxies as the groups did above.\n\n    **Evidence 6:** The deuterium to hydrogen ratio is completely independent of the evidence above and yet confirms the exact same amount of \"missing\" mass is needed.\n\n7. The cosmic microwave background's power spectrum is very sensitive to how much matter is in the universe. [As this plot shows](https://imgur.com/ssw6TJw), only if the observable matter is ~4% of the total energy budget can the data be explained.\n\n    **Evidence 7:** Independent of all observations of stars and galaxies, light from the big bang also calls for the exact same amount of \"missing\" mass.\n\n8. [This image may be hard to understand](http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/millennium/pie_millennium_walls.jpg) but it turns out that we can quantify the \"shape\" of how galaxies cluster with and without dark matter. The \"splotchiness\" of the clustering from these SDSS pictures match the dark matter prediction only.\n\n    **Evidence 8:** Independent of how galaxies rotate, their kinetic energy, etc... is the question of how they cluster together. And observations of clustering confirm the necessity of vats of intermediate dark matter\n\n9. One of the recent most convincing things [was the bullet cluster as described here](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2006/08/21/dark-matter-exists/). We saw two galaxies collide where the \"observed\" matter actually underwent a collision but the gravitational lensing kept moving un-impeded which matches the belief that the majority of mass in a galaxy is collisionless dark matter that felt no colliding interaction and passed right on through bringing the bulk of the gravitational lensing with it.\n\n    **Evidence 9:** When galaxies merge, we can literally watch the collisionless dark matter passing through the other side via gravitational lensing.\n\n10. In 2009, Penny et al. showed that dark matter is required for fast rotating galaxies to not be ripped apart [by tidal forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force). And of course, the required amount is the exact same as what solves every other problem above.\n\n    **Evidence 10:** Galaxies experience tidal forces that basic physics says should rip them apart and yet they remain stable. And the amount of unseen matter necessary to keep them stable is exactly what is needed for everything else.\n\n11. In 2018 astronomers discovered [NGC 1052-DF2](https://earthsky.org/space/ngc-1052-df2-galaxy-without-dark-matter), a galaxy which lacks dark matter. This discovery indicates that dark matter is not coupled to 'normal' matter, as both can be found separately. This demonstrates that dark matter is not simply a [difference in the behavior of gravity on large scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics).\n\n    In 2019 astronomers discovered a second galaxy without dark matter, [NGC 1052-DF4](https://earthsky.org/space/galaxies-lacking-dark-matter-df2-udg), confirming that the previous discovery was not a fluke.\n\n    **Evidence 11:** Galaxies can exist without dark matter, thus ruling out modified theories of gravity since physical laws should apply to all galaxies.\n\n12. There are counter-theories, [but as Sean Carroll does nicely here](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2011/02/26/dark-matter-just-fine-thanks/) is to show how badly the counter theories work. They don't fit all the data. They are way more messy and complicated. They continue to be falsified by new experiments. Etc...\n\n    To the contrary, Zwicky's proposed dark matter model from back in the 1930s continues to both explain and predict everything we observe flawlessly across multiple generations of scientists testing it independently. Hence dark matter is widely believed.\n\n    **Evidence 12:** Dark matter theories have been around for more than 80 years, and not one alternative has ever been able to explain even most of the above. Except the original theory that has predicted it all.\n\n**Conclusion:** The vanilla theories of dark matter have passed literally dozens of tests without fail over many many decades now. Very independent tests across different research groups and generations. So personally I think that we have officially entered a realm where it's important for everyone to be skeptical of the claim that dark matter isn't real.",

I believe the original version had his real name and it randomly switched to his metaphorical name (morning star) halfway through. Newer translations just use Lucifer. There are zero official biblical connections between \"Lucifer\" and \"Satan\". Satan was a word in Aramaic to describe someone who opposes somebody. David was described as a \"Satan\" in the original Aramaic text. The translations basically only kept \"Satan\" when the entity that was described as such was otherwise unnamed. This is why Satan does not have a consistent character at all, going from making friendly bets with God to tempting his son: it\u2019s believed to actually be describing different angels and/or demons instead of one evil entity.",

Apparently in the original Judaic mythology was just an angel dedicated to present humanity to god by temptation as it is his heavenly assigned function ( that's why he appears like a normal angel in its first Christian depiction, a mosaic in Ravenna, Italy ) but later its was \"bestialized\" by the constant fear for \"the Apocalypse\" and current Christian mythology still depicts it like that. Basically Judaic god is \"do what I say, but conveniently\" while Christian says \"I'm good, do your (my) good but conveniently\" (this second one leaving the problem with evil as a loose string somewhat solved by the Apocalypse and by adding angels as some kind of race that can also be against god ). With islam is even worse because they add the djinn to the math so the mythology becomes a mess.",

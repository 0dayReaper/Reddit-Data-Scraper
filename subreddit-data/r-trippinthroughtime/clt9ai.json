Lewis said something to the affect of, \"if there's ever a question of whether the Bible is inerrant, or whether God is good, you must always side with the goodness of God.\" Jesus explicitly claims to be the God of the old testament, but there's no way Jesus would command people to just go out and murder men, women, and children, and especially then punish people for not doing so. So I think the only real option, at least for Christians, is that the biblical authors misunderstood things and attributed them to God (because they probably had a shitty world view) and/or used God as a device to justify certain actions.  It's all really messy, and I really wish more Christians would stop insisting that they understand everything.",

If we humans had a God like justice approach and brought unimaginable disproportional punishment upon people, say torturing people for 10 years for a parking violation, would you still say the sinners do that to themselves?! You saying God is incapable of not torturing people for FUCKING ETERNITY?!\nHe did torture his son in hell for only 3 days for literally all the sins!",

We've discovered so much about the way we interact with the world since the bible was written, so why shouldn't we base morality on our current understanding.",

Some rules continue and are in that case repeated. There is a whole section in acts where God tells Peter that these rules do not apply anymore. This is also the point where it stops being a religion just for the jewish people, and the relationship with Jahweh is spread to include all people! :) i see why it may seem like people are picking and choosing, but thats not really the case.\n\nAbout homosexuality, if you hold a view against it, you do not base it solely on OT as well, but the subject is written about by Paul. :)",

If you're looking for an explanation, consider what hundreds of texts written about it suggest, which usually is because the human body is \"borrowed from Yahwe\" (\"God\" in American), and tattooing is considered abuse of \"His property\". \n\nAny doubt about the meaning of this passage is purely in the imagination of those who pick and choose. Which often are religious apologists who feel ashamed about the book they worship. They are ashamed because the bible is without any question a self-contradictory, homohobic, xenophobic, and downright homicidal scripture. Don't let these ignorants confuse you mate.",

Anyone who says different is probably a boring old timer who learned about god while getting whapped with a ruler or someone way more interested in using the religion as a control scheme than it's intended function.\n\nBesides, God's not so petty as to doom you to fire and brimstone(which honestly isn't even what hell propably is) for that sick tribal tattoo you got for sophmore year with your frat bros. And even if he was, that was a whole point of Jesus, who died for the redemption of \"everyone and everything\", even people with tattoos or people subbed to r/witchesvspatriarchy.",

Also, never eat pork or shellfish.  That good, traditional Christmas ham will send you straight to Hell!\n\nOh wait, the verse you're deliberately misrepresenting has something to say about all that.  *\"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.\"* Matt 5:17\n\nfulfill (*verb*) - 1.\nbring to completion or reality; achieve or realize (something desired, promised, or predicted), 2.\ncarry out (a task, duty, or role) as required, pledged, or expected.\n\nJesus' life did not abolish the Law, but His death fulfilled it.  It was brought to completion and no longer holds sway, hence the new covenant.  *In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.*  Hebrews 8:13\n\nDear so-called Christians,\n\nStop trying to use the Old Testament to excuse your bigotry. \n\nThanks, People who've actually read the Bible.",

They're often about health risks and about going against pagan culture. \n\n2. For the high priests to follow and obey. These are laws to keep oneself holy and to talk to God without Jesus as a mediator. \n\n2. And a section for general moralities that should be upheld by all of God's followers.

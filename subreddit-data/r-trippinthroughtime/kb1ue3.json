Although I would add that, historically, big wars also killed a staggeringly large amount of vulnerable populations like elders and children through looting and pillaging, basically the disruption of food production and other necessities. Wars in ancient China (aka the biggest of the bunch) were notorious for this, with near society-ending famines following the destruction. This is especially true if a society depended on complex infrastructure for farming, such as an extensive network of irrigation canals.",

Now I'm really curious about all this.\n\nAnd I'd be really interested to see the differences in warfare between different continents in terms of casualties broken down by age and class. Obviously, European and Asian wars are better documented than American (north or south) wars... Wonder how much of that is because Europeans and Asians had a greater proclivity to write stuff down, and how much is because the conquerors of the Americas had a proclivity to destroy everything that was already here.\n\nFucking hell, now I'm all interested. You did this to me.",

A small war was observed between two tribes in Papua New Guinea by early anthropologists. Only about 50 people were killed in the ensuing confrontation, but the results were crippling: Nearly half the adult male population of one group was killed in one battle.\n\nCompare that to World War II, the war that has killed more people than any other.  Depending on the estimate, about 80 million people died as a result of the bloodbath, which (if we\u2019re rounding down the numbers) was about 4 percent of the worlds population killed by various means over 5 years. \n\nAre humans becoming more destructive, or less destructive?",

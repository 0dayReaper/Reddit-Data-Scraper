Monday is going to be enough of a shit show without your added shenanigans.\n\nSimilarly, no, you're not starting the repair on Friday. Because you're going to come to me at 3:00 pm saying the supply houses are closed and the system will be down until Monday.\n\nYou can work on those two days, but we aren't starting new projects then.",

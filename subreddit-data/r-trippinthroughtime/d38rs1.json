My parents weren't too excited because this guy's paintings were all weird and grotesque, but they were too polite to refuse. \n\nA few months after the photographs were provided we received the two portraits. They were hideous. Mine was particularly bad, but my parents were too polite to not put both portraits up on display in our living room.\n\nThere was a girl at my school whose face was very flat and mildly deformed from some medical condition. We'll call her Vanessa. Vanessa looked *nothing* like me. Yet every time we got a new visitor they'd stare at my portrait for a while before saying \"is that... Vanessa?\" or else they'd look at it in silence and be too polite to comment on it at all. \n\nMy parents quietly got rid of both paintings a few years later. \n\nNow I sell hand drawn portraits from photos. I live in fear that one day I'll look at my work and see Vanessa's face staring back at me.",

Her father similarly had a painting done of him when he was battling gout to appear strong. \n\nIt even was so bad there are records of royalty/lords seeing portraits of a beautiful princess/lady and demanding to marry her only to be extremely upset when they realized they were catfished when she showed up to the wedding.",

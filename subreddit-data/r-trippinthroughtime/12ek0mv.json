One Mary is talking about how much she loves her baby and all the exciting potential that had been prophesised. The other deeply mourning her son's death.\n\nIt was very powerful.\n\nWe have benefit of retrospect for Good Friday, but we often forget what it was like in the moment. The crushing despair and mourning. But eternal good times were only 3 days away.\n\nToday is Friday. But Sunday's a coming.",

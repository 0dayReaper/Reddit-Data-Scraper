He was known to enjoy eating a meal while watching his victims get impaled.\n\nReason: listening to people relentlessly screaming for days (he liked to maximize the length of time they were alive during the process) in unimaginable agony while begging to be killed made him hungry. I\u2019m just speculating, but I suspect this is where the \u201cDracula\u201d connection comes from.\n\n(Edit: I mean the \u201cDracula the supernatural blood-sucking vampire\u201d connection, not the connection to the name itself)",

Dracula means basically \"son of the man who has the order of the dragon\" if I recall correctishly. There were some reports, or stories, that he would dip bread in his victims blood and eat it. That's probably more where the inspiration comes from, blood being count Dracula's literal bread. But this is all vague recollections, it's more fun than googling.",

Stopped the Turkish army in it's tracks and had them turn back home when they saw 10s of thousands of people impaled, leader said something to the tune of \"what can you do to a man who does such things?\"\n\nAnother fun titbit is the time when Turkey sent some people to check on him, he asked them to remove their hats in his presence and they refused, saying it is their custom not to bare their heads to anyone (or something like that). He responded by having his men nail their hats to their heads and send them back, saying he's confirmed them in their custom. He was so cruel and fucked up that he could place a golden cup by the water well and everybody would drink from it but no one would dare steal it. Law and order by fucken pole up your ding dong.",

It was expected that men would only demonstrate supposedly feminine emotions within the home, where it would be expected that women were there to comfort/support. \n\nHere, we see the man having just opened a black-bordered letter (which were given to inform of someone\u2019s death), so he is naturally grieving, and the woman is there to comfort him.",

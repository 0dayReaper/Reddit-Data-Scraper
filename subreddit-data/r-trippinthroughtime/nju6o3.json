The statue itself was made by Romans for a Roman emperor's villa in Italy, so it would be more correct to call this particular statue a Venus.\n\nHowever, it was likely based on an older statue by Doidalsas, a Greek sculptor living in Greek Bithynia, who would have referred to it as Aphrodite. This is unsurprising given Hadrian was notoriously obsessed with Greek culture. So in this context it is Roman Venus, but the image itself was originally that of Greek Aphrodite, so it can technically be used as an example of both.",

Like did all their adventures and stuff take place some time in a distant past, or did they sometimes get new stories? Did they believe the gods were running around and interacting with each other as citizens were just living their normal lives? I know for Abrahamic (sp? Is it the right word?) religions talk about events of the past, but that\u2019s because they believe that those people lived in a certain period of time and they go off of historical and prophetic texts that provide a timeline. Seems like that\u2019s not really how the beliefs of ancient Greeks came to be, so I\u2019m always just curious what time frame the stories are set in.",

Gods could favor cities (or heroes) and would often come to their aid to help them gain glory or fame. Gods might like a mortal because of their piety or warring skills or they particularly liked a sacrifice. \n\nGods would also procreate with mortals and their offspring would be mortal, but heroes of their time. Lay persons likely couldn't talk to gods, but priests had channels to gods and would recommend sacrifices to appease the gods. \n\nI guess one last thing to note is that both mortals and gods were tied to \"The Fates\" which foretold the future and could not be avoided. These prophecies would often be cryptic until they came to fruition.",

Britney ran for 2 hours on the treadmill and did 1000 crunches a day to look like that (and still got photoshopped in magazines). Kate Winslet in *Titanic* was considered unacceptably fat. So was Alicia Silverstone in *Batman and Robin*. (Look up photos of them from those movies - they were thin! Healthy, but very slim!) We all aspired to look like the women on *Friends,* who got thinner and thinner every season. No wonder every girl I went to high school with was on some kind of a diet; even the thin ones couldn't measure up. By grade 12 I had starved myself down to 100lbs (I'm also 5'6), but still cried myself to sleep at night over how \"fat\" I was. It's a wonder any of us got out of that decade alive, honestly.",

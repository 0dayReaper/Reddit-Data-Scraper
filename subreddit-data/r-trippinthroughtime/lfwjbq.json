I just want 4 days to do whatever I want.  Go for a walk, eat too much bad food, catch up on a TV show, blast some music while cleaning...but mostly just sit and play video games and wonder how the hell it's almost dinner time already.

Strictly scheduled this or that, I'll do this at that time and that at this time, and finding it weird when I say that the most I'll ever organize is dinner with my parents or going to the pub with a friend. I generally just get whatever stuff I have to do done with (maintenance stuff, shopping etc.), then do whatever I feel like I'd enjoy the most. Go for a six hour walk, read about random stuff online, binge a video game or strut around my apartment with headphones on for the whole day. The point of relaxation shouldn't be to get something done. That's for work days. If spending a weekend modding skyrim for a playthrough that I might never even do is what I want to do to relax, I'll do that. \n\nAnd funny enough, I'm consistantly the least stressed person in every social environment since the end of high school.

I'm saying there is a possibility. \n\nIt's the same reason a woman will try not to walk alone at night, or get nervous if she's on a quiet street with a guy following behind her, or if she's alone in a car park with some stranger loitering in the area. These are risk assessments women make all the time. It's extremely sad that women feel like living this way is necessary because of the ill intentions of a handful of bad eggs, but if the alternative is being raped, can you blame them for being cautious?\n\nYou say, \"It's just a party\". Maybe for a guy, it's \"just a party\" but for a woman, \"just a party\" can also mean things like:\n\n- Make sure you don't get too wasted and taken advantage of\n- Make sure you watch your drink so it doesn't get spiked\n- Make sure you stay with a buddy so that if something does go wrong, you have backup\n- Make sure you have reliable transportation home because jumping into a car with people you don't implicitly trust is far more dangerous for a woman\n- Make sure you don't go to the bathroom alone in case you get isolated and assaulted \n\nNote, I say *can*. Not every woman will be thinking of these things, but I'm sure most women have thought of at least one of these things. And this list isn't exhaustive. \n\nI understand for a guy, some things might also be applicable (e.g. Don't get too wasted so you don't get into a fight) but for men, the vast majority of the time, a failure to follow these guidelines won't result in being raped.\n\nWould you think \"It's just a party\" if you were a woman?

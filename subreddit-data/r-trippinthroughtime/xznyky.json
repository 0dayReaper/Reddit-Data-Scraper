In the southern U.S., we were taught in elementary school that people migrated for religious freedom and to escape the rule of the crown.\n\nThe narrative always changes from who is doing the teaching.  People in the U.S. have been so mislead through propaganda and bad education, that there is no wonder the rest of the world sees us as backward and arrogant.  \"Freest Nation on earth\", and yet our school boards ban books.\n\nAs an American that has slowly been waking up to these facts, I apologize to the world on behalf of our country.",

And the things it brings me are quite apparent all the time: heat, light, food, and a lovely day. There's no mystery, no one asks for money, I don't have to dress up, and there's no boring pageantry. And interestingly enough, I have found that the prayers I offer to the sun and the prayers I formerly offered to 'God' are all answered at about the same 50% rate.\n\nGeorge Carlin",

That\u2019s an under-appreciated fact.\n\nSimilarly, a lot of the peaceful religions never made it very far because the religions of violent imperial invaders tended to dominate and spread faster. Christianity and Islam were both particularly egregious in that regard, though they have both been somewhat tempered in recent centuries by theological shifts, especially Christianity. We don\u2019t need religion to get people to fight wars now that we have nation states with conscription laws.\n\nOn that note, you might say that another trait that was \u201cculturally selected\u201d in the evolution of religions was the ability for their political models of the world to evolve through theology. If a holy book 100% required an absolute dictator to rule the world, they would have to bend the meaning of that or morph into some other type of religion.",

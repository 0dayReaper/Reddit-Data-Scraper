The method begins by cutting down the trees and woody plants in an area. The downed vegetation, or \"slash\", is then left to dry, usually right before the rainiest part of the year. Then, the biomass is burned, resulting in a nutrient-rich layer of ash which makes the soil fertile, as well as temporarily eliminating weed and pest species. \"",

You know, burning down an entire forest is kinda hard and dangerous and destructive.\n\nI've actually been present for something similar, in this case it was just an overgrown field without any trees. They were just carrying little flamethrower-esque torches to burn up dead grass, though I think it was to prevent a wildfire rather than to work the land. It's fun to watch, probably not as fun to do lol",

Docks usually don't have backup train tracks. That's like saying \"unicorn poop\" is grammatically incorrect because unicorns don't exist.\n\nWords such as \"with a\" and \"at the\" are added to give context. Another example would be simplifying \"grandmother\" as \"mother of my parent\", despite \"grandmother\" not containing \"of my\". Or explaining \"border town\" as \"town at the border of something\".\n\nEdit: There's no need to be so pedantic. Word avalanches and tongue twisters are meant to be amusing, not 100% linguistically waterproof.",

I would have guessed something like 50k.\n\nhttps://finlandabroad.fi/web/usa/finns-in-states\n\n\"However, proper mass migration began only after the American Civil War (1861 \u2013 1865) and continued until the 1920s. Altogether approximately 389,000 Finns immigrated to North America during this time. The years between 1890 and 1914 were the most significant, as they saw over 200,000 Finns leaving for the U.S. \"",

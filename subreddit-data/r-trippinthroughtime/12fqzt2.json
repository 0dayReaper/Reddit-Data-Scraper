Respect people's boundaries and sexualities, but be open about your own and where you stand. Also, think optimistically; people's reactions aren't really down to you, and there are often external factors when something feels off. Plus, if you do get rejected, whatever, /that doesn't spell the end of that friendship as long as you're a generally good, respectful person and LISTEN when people tELL YOU THINGS/, and you can ALWAYS find other people!\n\n(All this being said I do have to acknowledge my privilege of being at an arts school lmao)",

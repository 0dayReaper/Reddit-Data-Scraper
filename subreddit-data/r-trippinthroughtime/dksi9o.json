The tell has a height of 15 m (49 ft) and is about 300 m (980 ft) in diameter. It is approximately 760 m (2,490 ft) above sea level.\n\nThe tell includes two phases of use, believed to be of a social or ritual nature by site discoverer and excavator Klaus Schmidt, dating back to the 10th\u20138th millennium BCE. During the first phase, belonging to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA), circles of massive T-shaped stone pillars were erected \u2013 the world's oldest known megaliths.More than 200 pillars in about 20 circles are currently known through geophysical surveys.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/trippinthroughtime/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Michelangelo originally didn't even want to paint the sistine chapel, going so far as to run away from Rome to one of this holiday homes while the pope was busy at war.  But eventually the pope won his war and returned to Rome, and sent the swiss guard out to drag Michelangelo back to Rome and force him to paint the ceiling.  Michelangelo was angry but finally capitulated, 'fine, i'll paint your stupid ceiling', then under his breath he muttered, 'hope you don't mind a bunch of dudes with their dicks out tho'.",

That being said, there were still people who didn't agree with that sentiment and tried to persuade M. to overpaint the genitals. In response Michelangelo painted one of his opponents in hell as Minos (complete with donkey ears &amp; snake biting his junk, which I personally think is way funnier than painting a bunch of dicks. \"You don't agree with my art? Whoops, you're in hell now.\")",

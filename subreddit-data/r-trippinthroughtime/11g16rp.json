                    "comment": "\n\nOhhhh, [The Awakening Conscience!!](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Hunt-AwakeningConscience1853.jpg) One of my favorite Pre-Raphaelite works! \n\n\nHunt was considered one of the more \u201cmorally good\u201d painters of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. He painted a lot of subjects about the morality of man, but most especially his (and some other notable Pre-Raphaelite paintings) dealt a lot with the trope of the \u201cfallen woman\u201d, but Hunt brings a bit of a different approach here than most works about fallen women in the Victorian age did. Instead of denouncing her as a wicked woman who has lost her reputation for a man, he shows us a more sympathetic side, where she breaks free of her chains to start a new life. \n\nThis painting features a \u201ckept woman\u201d, a mistress to the man in the painting. Her status as a mistress and not a proper wife is clear from her clasped hands. Notice no wedding ring!\n\nShe comes from a working class background most likely, but you can see from the apartments/house her lover has bought her that she is living in opulence now, and all in exchange for her body and her love. However the decorating, even for Victorian times, is very gaudy and over the top and not suitable for a \u201cfamily\u201d home. She\u2019s surrounded by beautiful expensive things, but they serve no purpose other than looking beautiful and keeping its owner happy. Much like the mistress here. \n\nThe title, The Awakening Conscience, refers to this \u201ckept\u201d woman coming to the sudden realization that there is a better life out there for her \u2014 she has leapt up from where she was sitting in the man\u2019s lap, entertaining his every whim as she is supposed to do as his mistress, suddenly transfixed by the beautiful nature outside her window. Nature in this case could be closely linked with purity, god, and beauty. In the reflection of the mirror we can see just how transfixed she is by the light pouring in and the highly detailed trees and leaves right outside her window. She has come to a revelation, one that is completely divorced (heh) from her kept house, kept life, and kept relationship. Surrounding the pair are reminders of this woman\u2019s precarious situation: the cat in the corner toying with a poor caught bird, the tapestry on the right, by the piano, that is unraveling at its very seams. The man has been singing a song about happier times of the past, as shown in the music on the piano \u2014 Thomas Moore\u2019s \u201cOft in the Stilly Night\u201d which speaks about these themes. As she leaps from the man\u2019s lap her partner seems to beg her to sit back down and enjoy their time together, but she is too caught up in her revelation. She has realized that as soon as the man tired of her, which he eventually must, she will be out of all of these luxuries and will have lost her reputation and maybe even her marriageability because of it. And she has also realized that she can break free from her caged bird life, to live a life of moral good. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note how radical a view this was during Victorian times, because it offers a hugely sympathetic view of the \u201cfallen woman\u201d. Hunt is not chastising this woman for her choices, in fact he seems to show that for a woman with no other way to rise in the ranks of society and keep a roof over her head, this is not a bad life at all. She has everything she needs \u2014 a house, an allowance, and a man who is infatuated with her. But she knows now it is totally fleeting. In a way, Hunt is redeeming her. She has \u201cawoken\u201d to find that there is a better, more fulfilling life out there for her, one that is beautiful and fruitful, and she no longer needs to be a \u201ckept\u201d woman to have value in society. \n\n\nHunt wasn\u2019t the only notable Pre-Raphaelite to show such a sympathetic view of women. [D.G. Rossetti\u2019s \u201cFound\u201d (unfinished)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Found_rossetti.jpg/270px-Found_rossetti.jpg)was going to be a scene where a prostitute, aging and down on her luck might be going to the bridge behind her in London to commit suicide (it was famous for prostitutes to jump from it to their deaths) However, a man from her former life \u2014 likely from her hometown before she moved to the city to sell herself, has found her and tries to stop her act. He is overcome by his love for this woman he used know, he wants to redeem her. He cares not for her current position as a fallen woman, he wants the woman he fell in love with back. Rossetti even wrote to Hunt about this painting, referencing the Awakening Conscience as inspiration: \n\n&gt; I can tell you, on my own side, of only one picture fairly begun [\u2026] The subject had been sometime designed before you left England and will be thought, by any one who sees it when (and if) finished, to follow in the wake of your \u201cAwakening Conscience\u201d [\u2026] The picture represents a London street at dawn, with the lamps still lighted along a bridge which forms the distant background. A drover has left his cart standing in the middle of the road (in which, i. e. the cart, stands baa-ing a calf tied on its way to market), and has run a little way after a girl who has passed him, wandering in the streets. He has just come up with her and she, recognising him, has sunk under her shame upon her knees, against the wall of a raised churchyard in the foreground, while he stands holding her hands as he seized them, half in bewilderment and half guarding her from doing herself a hurt. \n\nAnother Pre-Raphaelite to take a stab at the fallen woman trope was [Ford Maddox Brown, who painted \u201cTake Your Son, Sir!\u201d](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Ford_Madox_Brown_-_%60Take_your_Son%2C_Sir%27_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/1200px-Ford_Madox_Brown_-_%60Take_your_Son%2C_Sir%27_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg) (Also unfinished). At first it may appear to be a wife, dutifully handing over her son to her husband as a subservient wife should. However, the aggressiveness of the title, and the way the young woman looks defeated and aged as she thrusts the baby into the man\u2019s arms suggest she may be the wealthy man\u2019s mistress who has grown tired of her after she has given birth to their bastard son. She is \u201credeemed\u201d by the stars of the wallpaper behind her and the \u201chalo\u201d that the mirror behind her head forms. She is standing up to the man that provides for her to look pretty and do nothing else \u2014 for the sake of her child. She may be a \u201cfallen woman\u201d, but she is a fierce mother and protector, a noble cause for women in that time. \n\nThank you for tagging me, and thank you for allowing me to go off on another art history rant about the Pre-Raphaelites! I am always happy to gush about this piece of art history!",

If you're interested in more of the Pre-Raphaelites (and some other movements around the time in Victorian English art history), I would highly suggest reading works by Elizabeth Prettejohn. She is a great art historian who doesn't overfill her essays with meaningless floofy words to make herself sound smarter :) I really enjoy her essays and books, one of my favorites being titled simply \"The Art of the Pre-Raphaelites\"!",

Her hands being positioned on top of her shawl suggests that she's also pushing down on her clothing.

It's extremely possible he was copping a feel and this is what led her to have this sudden realization. Perhaps she wasn't in the mood, or she was already having these thoughts and his lustful grabbing at her really switched a lightbulb on in her mind. Her clasped hands definitely suggest she is pushing his hand away, or her muscles have tightened up in a typical flight or fight response, and his open mouth protest seems annoyed. It's like he's saying \"Come on, we're just having fun, aren't we?\" In his mind he is doing as he is entitled to do, feel up his mistress for a quickie while his wife and children are at home waiting for him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt has all suddenly dawned on her her role in this whole affair. Just looking at her left hand, every single finger has a beautifully jeweled ring on it except, notably, the ring finger. She is well kept and well compensated, she is adored, but not loved. She will never be the wife, just the mistress. She will never be the number one in this man's life. Even the clock on the piano, decorated with embracing lovers, seems to signify a countdown to when her reign as his favorite mistress will end. It's like the clock is taunting her, tick tock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe symbolism of her looking out of the window is not necessarily because she has become distracted, but rather she is looking for a \"way out\". A way out of the actual physical home, and a way out of this relationship that makes her feel valueless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your comment!",

Ima just tag them\u201c and magically they will pop up and drop a long ass, informative and enriching essay comment like it\u2019s the most normal thing in the world. I always like to imagine it as pulling out an expert out of your coat pocket who will excitedly tell you all about whatever you want to know and it\u2019s the cutest thing ever. \nAlso: it\u2019s always so crazy to see how much people can see in a painting or any sort of work actually. Like 90% of those things I wouldn\u2019t have even noticed much less seen as something deliberate and meaningful and here people are just interpreting and analyzing it in a way that shows us why it\u2019s so cool almost as if letting us see it through their eyes and it\u2019s just so wholesome. \n\nThank you for the great comment. I really enjoyed it!",

It's the conscious control she tries to establish against the grain regardless of what that would cost her relationships. The result is that the people closest to her have daily proof that she doesn't see them as fully formed people worthy of the considerations she obviously feels that she alone deserves. Black and white  thinking mixed with a healthy dose of entitlement is a bitch that way.\n\n It's one thing to embrace your own misery as an unhealthy character trait (and a self defense strategy), it's entirely another to try to trick somebody else into that unholy mess or make them feel like the problem when they don't fall for it.",

Our disorder largely revolves around this fear, usually a result of childhood abandonment or abuse by parents. Many of us were taught we weren\u2019t worth anything and that everyone will leave us like they did. So as an (unhealthy) coping mechanism some people with BPD develop a feeling of entitlement to combat that narrative from their childhood that is reinforced through their mental health issues. They think \u201cno, I do deserve ___\u201d but instead of forming healthy boundaries to ensure they aren\u2019t mistreated (as any sort of boundaries were generally punished growing up) they use manipulation to try to get that treatment. Which obviously is self defeating, but for some that never mature much (the louder but smaller part of the community from what I have seen inside these spaces, at least among people who are aware they have BPD) they don\u2019t learn from their mistakes and only double down on the toxic behavior. \n\nHaving strong boundaries is important for anyone with BPD as well as the people who are close to them. It\u2019s the best way to promote change in their behavior (if they have the capacity for it at least) and gaining boundaries of our own gives us a way to protect ourselves from abuse (which is important as most of us are predisposed to being abused due to the frequency of child abuse we faced). It\u2019s a healthier way for us to feel safe that puts some of the power back in our hands, as most of us at some point were disempowered and taught that we don\u2019t have value so we have to \u201cmake\u201d people love us or at least stick around. When we were kids we didn\u2019t get to choose whether the people in our lives stayed or treated us well, but as adults we can also choose to remove ourselves from relationships that harm us. That can be very counterintuitive as we generally see ourselves as the party that has to cling to relationships. \n\nIt\u2019s important to enforce your boundaries even if that means her not being part of your life.

Most people can find dishonest people and this upsets those particular people. These people then try to mask their dishonesty with niceness and get pushed further away. Being nice to someone is also completely different than being kind. Best bet is to look up the definitions of both nice and kind and compare and contrast them to understand the social issue.",

So eat all the raw cookie dough you want.\n\nEDIT: If the packaging states do not eat raw then use common sense and don't eat raw.",

            "comment": "The incidence of salmonella from raw or undercooked eggs is vanishingly low, and there are tons of other things in the world that might give you salmonella. You're far far far more likely to get it from something that's been touched by someone who has touched raw chicken, than from any kind of egg.\n\nThere are whole desSerts (autocorrect, you *bitch*) that depend *entirely* on raw egg. Mousse, for example, depends on raw egg whites for volume and structure (you can make it without, but the difference is clear). So the fact that there is some egg in your cookie dough is probably not a good enough reason to not eat it raw.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, don't let your dreams be dreams. It's just salmonella, don't be a wuss.\n\nEdit: As far as flour goes, if you have wet raw flour, it can make a decent bacterial culture, but the [water activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_activity) in cookie dough is essentially nil, so it's hard to see how you could get a colony of significant size without storing it in an unsafe way for a significant period.\n\nCookie dough is in many ways a really bad growth medium. No water, craploads of sugar, salt, alcohol (from the inevitable vanilla extract), butter or shortening, either of which aren't friendly to bacterial contamination. Eggs and flour are your vectors, and in some kind of emulsion or wet dough, that was given the amount of time to set up that store-bought cookie dough has, might be a concern. But given the components, I wouldn't worry. If you're really worried, whip up a batch of your own, and eat it on the spot.",

Even though, like you said, its outside of their wheelhouse. \n\nIn reality, your Doctor isn't a detective. They have no idea where you got salmonella. And if it's not a big outbreak they probably don't care. It would be an entirely different group of doctors and researchers to determine where the outbreak is coming from. \n\nBut when you go to the doctor and you have salmonella, you're bound to ask \"Where could I have gotten this?\" And the real answer from the doctor is \"I dunno, something you ate probably.\" \n\nBut Doctors have probably learned that patients don't like to hear \"I don't know\" so instead they throw out a few foods that might have salmonella and hope you ate one of them and call it a day.  \n\n(When I say you, I mean in general, not you specifically.)",

From the [Annual report of the Scientific Network on Microbiological Risk Assessment 2020](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/supporting/pub/en-1991) published by the European Food Safety Authority:\n\n&gt;The representative from Switzerland gave a presentation on Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli\n(STEC) in flour. STEC strains are often found in food and cause human infections. Although STEC\nO157:H7 is most often responsible for human disease, various non-O157 subtypes have caused individual human infections or outbreaks. The importance of STEC serogroup typing is decreasing\nwhile detection of virulence gene patterns has become more relevant. Whole genome sequencing\n(WGS) reveals the entire spectrum of pathogen information, such as toxin variant, serotype, sequence\ntype, and virulence factors. **Flour has not been considered as a vector for STEC; however, this product\nhas been associated with several STEC outbreaks in the last decade. Flour is a natural product, and\nmilling does not include a germ-reducing step. Flour is rarely eaten raw, but the risks associated with\nthe consumption of unbaked dough are probably underestimated.** The aim of this study was to\ndetermine the prevalence of STEC in flour samples (n = 93) collected from Swiss markets and to fully\ncharacterize the isolates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and WGS. **The prevalence of STEC\nin these flour samples was 10.8% as indicated by PCR, and a total of 10 STEC strains were isolated**\n(two flour samples were positive for two STEC subtypes). We found one stx2-positve STEC isolate\nbelonging to the classic serogroups frequently associated with outbreaks that could potentially cause\nsevere disease. However, we also found several other common or less common STEC subtypes with\ndiverse virulence patterns. Our results reveal the benefits of WGS as a characterization tool and that\n**flour is a potentially and probably underestimated source for STEC infections in humans.**",

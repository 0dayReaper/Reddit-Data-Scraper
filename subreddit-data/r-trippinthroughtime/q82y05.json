So I would instead expect the sub-continent to be organised into a rather loose confederal band that primarily exists to reduce barriers on economic activity, much like the post-WWII pan-Europe institutions that precede the EU. It might have issues if there are a few larger member states that, like the EU, fight over the course the community should take and over influence over the smaller members, but also like the modern EU it could have a growing movement of people identifying more with the wider group than with their local community, and wishing to introduce more state-like bodies like a full legislature to the top level.",

When the British were kicked out they made sure to grant autonomy to the 500+ independent kingdomes that existed around the time in India, the lapse of paramountcy did exactly what British were doing for the last 200 years, divide the continent. It was a pathetic plan to balkanize the subcontinent but lucky for us we had leaders like Sardar patel ( biggest statue in the world, statue of unity, is now dedicated to him ).\nThere's also reports of covert British support to Hyderabad to help them fight against the Indian army, it was one of the richest and biggest independent kingdomes of India. Imagine how hard it would've been to integrate most to India, at the end of 1947 there were only 3 big states left independent and rest had agreed to join india and a few went with Pakistan.",

Denemark, Kenneth Pomeranz\nand Amiya Kumar Bagchi have criticized\nMaddison for grossly underestimating\nper-capita income and GDP growth rates\nin Asia (again, mainly China and India) for\nthe three centuries up to 1820, and for\nrefusing to take into account contemporary\nresearch demonstrating significantly higher\nper-capita income and growth rates in\nAsia. According to Frank and Denemark,\nhis per-capita income figures for Asia up\nto 1820 are not credible, go \"against what\nwe know from sources\" and may need to be\nadjusted by a factor of two. Maddison's\nestimates have also been critically reviewed\nand revised by the Italian economists\nGiovanni Federico\"\n\nBritish historian Playfair described the situation\nin India at the time as,\" In 1707, only ninety-eight\nyears ago, the Great Mogul ruled over a country\nequal in extent, and little inferior in population,\nto France, Spain, Germany, and England. His\nrevenues amounted to thirty-two millions\nsterling, which, at that time, was nearly equal\nto the whole revenues of all the monarchs of\nEurope. He is now circumscribed to a territory\nless than the smallest county in England, and\nis the vassal at will of a company of English\nmerchants, who, with all their greatness, do not\ndivide profits equal to one week of his former\nrevenues!\"\n\nTo put this into perspective, the richest province of the Mughal Empire, the Bengal Subah (Modern day Bangladesh and West Bengal) accounted for 12% of the world's GDP. It had even undergone a proto industrialization and single handedly accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia before being forcibly deindustrialized by the British  \"According to evidence cited by the economic historians Immanuel Wallerstein, Irfan Habib, Percival Spear, and Ashok\nDesai using data from primary sources show that mid-late 18th-century real wages and living standards in Mughal Bengal (under the Nawabs of Bengal) and the South Indian Kingdom of Mysore (under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan) were higher than in Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in Europe.\"\n\nScarcely more than two centuries later in 1943, Bengal, formally the most prosperous region on earth underwent a massive famine killing 2.1 to 3.1 million people out of the population of 60.3 million people. Even today, the Indian opinion on British hero Winston Churchill...is dim to put it diplomatically.\n\nMore evidence cited by these same historians indicate per-capita agricultural output and standards of consumption in 17th-century Mughal India was on-par with or higher than in 17th-century Europe and early 20th-century British India. The Mughal Empire also had a higher proportion of workers in the secondary sector and a greater percentage of urbanisation during this period. It's worth noting that these figures stagnated or decreased during British colonisation. \n\nGiven the history we're taught it's absolutely wild how little more than two centuries ago societies that which are now considered dirt poor have actually been ahead of Europe economically for basically all of human history minus perhaps three centuries.",

The damage to Bengal was twofold, first due to the loss of potential revenues due to selling raw materials at extortionately low prices which could have been made into more profitable articles of export and reinvested into the economy of Bengal, and secondly the drainage of currency paying a foreign power for the same textiles that the region had been manufacturing previously.

From 0 Ad to about the 1500's the various polities that existed in the southern Asian region combined accounted for about 33% of the the world economy.\n\nChina averaged about 26% during this period (overtaking briefly between the 1500's and 1600's) and the Roman empire (whilst it existed) accounted for 21% of the world economy. Out of the last 2000 years Madisson's study covers India has had the largest share of the world economy for about 1600 years.\n\nBoth China and India have been huge siphons of wealth even going back to Greek and Roman times. The Romans were huge consumers of silk, incense and spices. It's estimated that by putting on a quarter tax on imports from the trade ships leaving to India (tertarte) the Roman administration actually doubled their revenues from Egypt.\n\nEgypt had previously (AD 14)  provided 1/3rd of the revenues of the entirety of the empire (300 million sesterce alongside a contribution of grain for Rome's grain dole) but trade established with the east (Late 1st century Ad) increased that to nearly 2/3rds (576 million) not withstanding the smaller 1/40th portoria tax when these items were exported to other regions of the empire. \n\nIn essence the value of the tax on the Indian ocean trade alone was equivalent to the revenues sent to Rome from every other Roman province combined in the entire empire excepting Egypt whilst also supplying Rome with luxury Eastern imports. The enormous influx allowed Rome to expense the massive legions over the entire empire (Which required roughly 430 million sesterces per annum) that allowed them to hold their territory over western Europe and the Mediterranean even when doing so would put Rome in an economic deficit. (Not all regions provided enough to pay the cost involved in holding them)",

The Battle of Plassey was a decisive battle where because of the treachery of Mir Jafar, Siraj-ud-Daulah, the then Nawab of Bengal had to concede to Robert Clive. This marked the beginning of the takeover of the subcontinent by the EIC and the culmination of the 7 years war (fought in Europe but it spilled into India) and the end of the carnatic campaign which was supported by the French East India company on the side of the Deccan monarchs (the third carnatic war).\n\nEdit : IIRC the French also supported Siraj-ud-Daulah in the Battle of Plassey in 1757. Ultimately, Siraj's defeat hinged on the betrayal of Mir Jafar. Alamgir II and Robert Clive never met each other. By this time, the Maratha Empire had almost reached its zenith had was successful in igniting the decline of the Mughal Empire and its balkanisation into multiple regional satrapies. I'd love for someone from /r/badhistory to correct me and provide more nuance! Thanks!\n\nEdit 2 - I was wrong as /u/le_pagla_baba pointed out. It is the painting of Shah Alam II surrendering to Clive.",

How this happened is an interesting story:\n\nIn the 1700s England was getting sick of paying the Chinese for tea because colonialists don't really like paying for things, and the Chinese wanted real money, which in those days was Spanish silver.\n\nThe English didn't want to part with silver, but they figured they could grow opium on large colonial plantations in India (which they had already colonized by this point) and peddle that to the Chinese instead. The Chinese didn't really want to allow all their people to become opium addicts, so they pushed back, but the English were so adamant they fought (and won) military wars to push opium in China. So now they could effectively buy their tea with opium instead of silver.\n\nBut the English still weren't happy with the fact that they didn't have direct control over producing the tea. So they decided to steal some Chinese tea plants (which were jealously guarded in China) and grow them in India. This took a lot of work and it never became entirely feasible to grow Chinese-style tea in India, but Indian tea kind of became its own thing.\n\nSo now that English were growing their own tea in India, they decided to go another step and encourage the consumption of tea among Indians in India.\n\nSee, when Indian consumers bought tea grown in India by Indian labor, the profits went to... England. Colonialism is pretty lucrative like that.\n\nAnyway, *that's* how we Indians got into the tea habit.",

I've seen people say that if you have a job outside the house (meaning that you're not home for 8 hours a day) it's abusive to have a dog.\n\nThere was also a highly upvoted \"life pro tip\" a few days ago that said a dog costs as much as a car and you should budget accordingly, or not get a dog.\n\nThe downvotes are likely from people who think that it's entirely reasonable that he's not a retired millionaire at 27. Because, you know, it's irresponsible to get a dog otherwise.",

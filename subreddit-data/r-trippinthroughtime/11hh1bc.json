That wuzznt Santa!\n\n That year, the birds friggin sucked ass. So much so, we cudda had great dreft pretty picks, but then they had to go an' friggin win enough games in the second half of the season to fuck that up! \n\nCome Christmas game, there's snow in tha stands, all is Philly fans are pissed the season is for nothing at this point and the only thing wes got to looks forward to is Santa at half time. Woodnt yous know it, the real Santa we have come every year for this game is piss drunk on his ass at home and didn't even show up. \n\nSo the event staff at tha game pull some drunk bro from tha stands who just happens to be wearing a Santa costume down to the field fer half time. We Philly fans, after a dog shit season at a game that no one cares about, only have one thing we're lookin foward to; SANT. AN WE DONT EVEN GET THAT!\n\nSos dis wuz the straw to break our backs. We fuggin LOSE IT! We start makin snow bolls from the grimy ass, rock laiden snow from the stands and throw them at this fake ass, drunk imposter Santa an the world had a field day with the story, \"Philly phans throw snow balls at Santa\" That happened in the God damn 1970s and STILL that's all people bring up bout Philly!\n\nLol I hope you've enjoyed that rendition of a Philadelphian explaining that story. It's tough to do the north Philly accent justice through text, but i hope you could imagine it.",

Rare I would miss Bill Cosby on tv, and despite knowing a lot of what he said was scripted, always saw him as a wise calm head, and thinker. Not the first star or someone highly thought of to have a hidden dark side. Being a fan of dialects, and accents, I doubt i'll ever speak any language really \"properly\". To me odd or interesting sounding words and phrases are my \"shiny things\" to collect! I reccommend everyone to get a good basic education, take an interest in languages, and take their time deciding where they want to go in life, before jumping into further education.",

There's a few reasons for that. \n\nThe most likely is that cannabis is an Asian plant, and it seems to have arrived in the Middle East around the time the Old Testament was written. It may not have been widespread enough to warrant discussion.\n\n Of course, psychoactive plants grow everywhere, and while they get mentioned in the Bible, it's always as a medicine or poison, not as a drug. While the apostles speak of the importance of being sober, it's not clear they are talking about substance use specifically or just taking religion seriously. \n\nThere have been scholars that suggest an unknown plant in the Bible, used to make an anointing oil,  \"kaneh-bosm\", may be cannabis. That appears to be a minority position.\n\nSmoking as we know it didn't seem to happen until pipe and cigarette tobacco culture was imported from Indigenous America in the 1500s. Old world drug use was usually from infused wine, oils, edibles,  hotboxing enclosed spaces, and perhaps inhaling burning resin from an open bowl.",

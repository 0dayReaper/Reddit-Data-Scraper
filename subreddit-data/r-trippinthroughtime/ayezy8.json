Metallica had a lot of classical influences in their older stuff, too, so it's still not crazy to say it might have helped inspire it. ",

Metalheads are *definitely* gatekeepers and it pisses me off. The looks you get as a metalhead if you say you like -core music is frustrating, and vice versa. \n\nBut *beyond* their gatekeeping it feels like metalheads like a lot of classical music, jazz, folk, etc.\n\nThat said, again, I personally hang out with and associate myself with and as a metalhead. For all I know, hip hop heads are like \"Yo dude Claude Debussy is slaps\" \"I fuckin love Les Mis\" \"I would pay money to smoke a joint with Bob Dylan\"",

I mean yes he was generally religious because everyone was back then, but there's evidence to suggest he kept his church job for so long because it paid the bills.\n\nHe would still be pretty taken aback by modern society and I struggle to imagine it would be in a good way.",

Most composers definitely made music to pay the bills (Mozart), and I don't think that Bach isn't included there. But at the same time, there is something otherworldly about the music he wrote that makes me have a hard time believing he wasn't extremely passionate about religion. ",

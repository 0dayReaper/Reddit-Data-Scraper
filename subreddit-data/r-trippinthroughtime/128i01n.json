Once we find out what was making me feel terrible, I am much more active in initiating.\n\nIt could be a health thing, it could be stress, it could be a lot of things, but I bet there is something keeping him from initiating.

And I know this won\u2019t work for everyone, but I just stopped initiating so often. Rejection would make me spiral and that wasn\u2019t good for anyone. We talked, and we had a pretty good understanding of where we were on the frequency scale and where we wanted to be. And my initiating pretty frequently would leave him in a position where he would turn me down and he felt bad, and I would feel bad and everyone was just sad. So I just backed off completely for a few months and that really helped, and now he\u2019s the one who initiates. And because I\u2019m the higher libido partner, I\u2019m usually ready to go anytime he is. It\u2019s really worked out well. It took us about a year to get to this point. And there\u2019s just less weight and stress around sex. It\u2019s less fraught with obligation and self consciousness. And because of this, my husband actually initiates waaaay more than he has in years. We\u2019re now closer to my ideal frequency than we are to his prior stated ideal. I think it really helps him to know that he\u2019s not obligated and knows I\u2019m not gonna be springing sex on him daily. I have rejection sensitivity dysphoria due to my adhd so the rejection around sex was honestly soul crushing at times and the harder I pursued, the more he felt bad about having to say no. \n\nI\u2019m so SO much happier now that we\u2019ve found what works for us.  \n\nI realize though that for some partners, not initiating for a few months might only lead to no sex at all. But believe it or not, I got this advice to back off from the dead bedrooms subreddit. I was shocked that it actually worked.",

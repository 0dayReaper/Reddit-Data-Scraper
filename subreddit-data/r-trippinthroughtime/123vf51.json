We caused it, and we're hardly acknowledging it whilst doing nothing to stop it.\n\nI will not ignore peoples or countries' attempts to deal with the issue, but *none* of those issues tackle the larger scale issues with fossil fuel companies. All of it gets directed onto the individual, like us, who are told to recycle and not waste anything.\n\nThe problem is a collective problem. It's fueled by mass consumerism culture and companies banking off of their ability to control essentially everything we buy and consume.\n\nIt's a larger scale issue than \"a bus driving straight for a cliff and the passengers are helpless.\" A more realistic perspective for the general public, would be to be blindfolded with headphones on playing soft classical music as the bus speeds for the cliff, and the passengers don't even know there's a problem until it's too late.\n\nThis is a generational issue, that's how large the scale of it is. People have been born into this problem that never even had a hand in starting it, and yet they seem to understand the problem the best.\n\nWhether or not the issue will be addressed by our governments and large corporations is besides the point. We have to be the reason things change. I know it's such a cringy statement, *\"You have the power to change the world!\"*, but its objectively true. The only reason issues like Cimate Change aren't prioritized is because our governments don't care, and we keep going to work every day. As long as that continues, *nothing is going to change, and we are all fucked.*\n\nI personally either see a large-scale workers strike taking place sooner rather than later, or *later comes,* and people start revolting. I wish I was exaggerating, but when your lakes start drying up due to heat waves that only get worse, and floods that wash out your crops every year, people will get fed up. *Especially* when working conditions become unbearable in certain locations.\n\nThings will change, one way or another. Either way, it's going to be shitty consequences. But the longer we wait, the worse those consequences become.",

Be Engaged.\n\nThe majority of the shitshow you see is because of republicans and red states removing regulations, stonewalling protections, and wishwashing real damages by pointing to fabricated lies like drag queens and immigrants.\n\nAnd if you look at some red states, you could see the potential if people just showed up and voted. Especially younger people who are statistically 30 point more favored to voting democrat than republican. But on average there is only 20-25% turnout of those under the age of 35.\n\nTexas (40% turnout):\n\n* 29M Citizens\n* 22M Eligible Voters.\n* 17M Registered Voters.\n* 9M Voted in 2022.\n* only 15% of those under the age of 35 Voted in 2022.\n* Ted cruz won by 200K votes in 2018.\n\nFlorida (50% turnout): \n\n* 21M Citizens\n* 15M Eligible Voters\n* 10M Registered Voters.\n* 7M Voted in 2022.\n* Desantis won by 30k votes in 2018 (1.5m in 2022).\n\nOhio (45% turnout):\n\n* 12M Citizens.\n* 9.4M Eligible Voters.\n* 8M Registered voters.\n* 4M Voted in 2022\n* Senator Vance (R) won by 250K votes in 2022.\n\nDemocrats have only had 90 days of actual majority senate and house control in the last 60 years. And even then they needed to water down bills to get McCain to vote alongside them because 2 senators were hospitalized unable to vote. Just those three states would have yielded democrats 5 new senators, **thats ~500K votes where ~25M eligible voters did not vote**.\n\nSo don't be depressed, don't ignore reality, because this is happening in YOUR BACKYARD. YOU &amp; YOUR CHILDREN WILL FACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY. Its not some far away place that has no effect on you. You will see the damages of these actions that continue to happen. Be ENRAGED, BE ENGAGED, BE ATTENTIVE, BE ACTIVE. \n\nAnd sure keep saying, i need to ignore it because its unhealthy to be angry all the time, or i need to laugh at these events because humor helps me cope, sure but the cancer is there, you can ignore it, laugh at it, make jokes about it, but you gotta do something about it too, or else its definitely gonna kill you.",

Alongside Mancin and Sinema.\n\nThe issue was put to rest and allowed the union another 3 months of negotiation to find a common ground. \n\nWhen there was no progress, Biden interjected again and asked congress to push forward the deal that 9 out of 13 Unions agreed to, and push for legislative means to pass the sick days at a later point and allowing the unions to seek the sick days independently.\n\nWhich I believe 4-5 Unions have now gotten independently.\n\nSo yes, Biden interjected into rail workers strike, by forcing the rail companies to give them what they were asking for without having to put at risk hundreds of millions of american people who have nothing to do with the rails, but EVERY REPUBLICAN voted against giving them the sick days.",

There is no legal pathway to go after them for train derailment, you can go after them for any negligence after the derailment, but that information is still in the process of being collated and verified and analyzed. \n\nIn reality there are about 1,500 Train derailments every year, over 100,000 Truck accidents every year. around 30% deal with hazardous materials. That is the factual reality that has been going on for decades. \n\nWhat has Biden done to address that issue? He has allocated and pushed through congress the largest infrastructure plan that is using about 25-40Billion USD to improve the train and rail systems in the USA.\n\nIf you can find proof of willful negligence that the leadership of Norfol Southern can be arrested for, id welcome it. But the issue of the train derailing, isnt a illegal action. Its an accident. \n\nIt could be prevented with regulations and control mechanism. But Republicans remove them again and again, just like the bank regulations that caused one of the biggest banks to go under a few weeks ago.",

Change would happen, whether or not it was the change you intended. 2020 saw some of the highest voter turnout rates in history, which means we almost hit 2/3, but young people 18-25 were still significantly lower than that. You're saying voting doesn't work, but at the same time the exact same section of the population all of you are saying is making all the decisions also had the highest voter turnout of any age bracket. Over 3/4 of the 65+ voting eligible population voted. I don't get the sense you are part of that population, so you can say voting doesn't work all you want, but you have to also recognize that *you* are the reason why.",

They felt the rest of us were being paranoid and negative in our thinking. And I felt bad for people who had thoroughly learned their lesson about trusting others, many of them as children. People aren\u2019t usually just born distrusting the world. They are punished until they do.\n\nWe didn\u2019t set out to reach an agreement, but we all arrived at one thing- that people are motivated by what benefits them. Sometimes they benefit by doing good, sometimes by doing bad. It\u2019s preferable to live in situations where things are set up so people benefit more from doing good. Wish there was more of that.",

But I don't know if it's just me, but the atmosphere seems to be changing into something very concerning. There's been a shift towards seeing our condition as something made up and delusional that's growing with more people. I could write a novel on all the reasons I think this is happening but I've had to just stop looking at any of it. I don't tend to get reactive or have my day ruined by what some asshole has to say on the Internet but even I'm feeling very uneasy with the climate right now and spending too much time looking at what's going on and what people have to say is really affecting me mentally.

I realized that if something were to happen that was monumental enough that I should know about it, then it will make its way to me. Either I'll see it on my reddit feed or people will tell me about it. More importantly I realized all news is never ending and finds a way to be politicized, telling you the opinions you should have and the wrong opinions other people have. But the fact is, nothing is coming up in this news cycle or any news cycle in the foreseeable future that I can or will really do anything about outside of voting, and I know how I'm going to vote regardless. There's nothing that will show up in the news one day where I'm suddenly going to realize \"Oh, now I'm going to vote for the other party\" and I think most democrats and republicans feel the same way here if they were being honest with themselves. If I were to ever vote differently, it would almost certainly be a slow rolling realization based on many, many factors. There's no prize for being the most informed person about politics except a declined mental state, and I only have the bandwidth to know/care about so much. So why would I waste that mental bandwidth on beating myself over the head with details about things that won't change my actions or improve my quality of life?",

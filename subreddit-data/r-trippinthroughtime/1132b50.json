The holiday is based on Lupercalia, a Roman holiday adopted by the church. And not so surprisingly they dedicated their fake holiday designed to subvert the traditional holiday to a possibly real person (but likely not) whom they adorned in the pomp of christian myth. The fact that there exists at least 3 different persons who could have been the basis should be the biggest giveaway that he's likely fake, the fact that christians believe in him should be proof that he was certainly fake. \n\n\nCelebrated at the ides of February, or February 15, Lupercalia was a fertility festival dedicated to Faunus, the Roman god of agriculture, as well as to the Roman founders Romulus and Remus.",

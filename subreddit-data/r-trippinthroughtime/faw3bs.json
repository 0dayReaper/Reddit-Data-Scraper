If you aren\u2019t smart and quick enough to come up with funny material on the spot, that\u2019s not something you can really practice. The people who end up doing improv seem to often be the people who can\u2019t pull off a normal standup set, but if you can\u2019t be funny with material you\u2019ve had time to write out and prepare you won\u2019t have any more luck trying to be funny on the spot.",

A lot of the best comedy actors out there did some time in improv and there also seems to be patterns where some of the most successful all worked together. I think the UCB is where a lot of big names came from, but more than anything they eventually stopped doing improv and moved onto new things.\n\nI\u2019ve honestly never watched an improv show but I have listened to some improv podcasts that were honestly hilarious to me so there\u2019s certainly I think some genuine skill and value to it.",

I have heard from aspiring comedian friends that they would rather train in Chicago and then move to Los Angeles because the Second City Hollywood isn\u2019t as reputable. From what I know, the go to place for improv and sketch out in LA is the Groundlings theater. \n\nI have also seen some bad improv in my day, hell I\u2019ve been in bad improv. But truly good improv exists you just need to know where to find it. If you ever find yourself in Chicago I highly recommend coming to see Improvised Shakespeare and hopefully they\u2019ll be able to change your feelings towards improv.",

Maybe lots of the guys in Baghdad bared a resemblance to my grandfather, but now we're too diversified. Over the past 3 generations there has been too much migration for that many homogenous traits among a population where there can be, as you said, like 20 types of faces.",

And when those genes kept dominating, they were passed on. \n\nThat's my theory of why we have dopplegangers now and in the past. I think it's a good way to put an observation to the evidence of our common ancestry. \n\nI imagine that one of my offspring will, in future, have children with a person who has an ancestor that looks like me and will have a kid that looks just like me. \n\nAnd that person will be a descendant of Danny McBride.",

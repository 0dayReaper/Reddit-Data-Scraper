Have you tried being lazy for a week straight when you\u2019re doing ok? After 3 days it becomes more work than just getting up and being productive. Sometimes it\u2019ll be another mental disorder but sometimes it\u2019s about well being (do you like your job, are you avoiding other stressors etc). Like maybe quiet BPD presents itself as laziness when you\u2019re in the splitting &amp; freakout phase\\*. Sometimes shit just sucks and you won\u2019t be able to fix it but at least you know and that\u2019s most of the way there.\n\nLaziness as a moral concept is, like, so last century, dude\n\n\\* Not saying this is a common presentation of BPD symptoms but I personally just go to sleep involuntarily when I experience splitting, though I don\u2019t meet the clinical criteria for BPD",

The Republican majority is so gerrymandered that Dems could win an election statewide by 10 points and still not get a majority. It\u2019s a one party state whether voters vote for it or not (lol, actually like Russia/China). \n\nOh, we also had a referendum and voted by like - holy shit I just looked thus up, actually 75% - to stop gerrymandering and draw maps with a commission and legally required that they be fair, competitive, etc. and they just\u2026ignored the law. Like they literally just refused (despite state court telling them to stop 4 times) and delayed until it got kicked to Republican court that said \u201cwell, since there\u2019s no time to redraw the maps before the election, these are the maps. Also nobody gets punished or goes to jail for violating the law\u201d.\n\n^ They are now wanting to make it harder/almost impossible in a polarized state, to get pass referendums by raising threshold to 60% of the vote (or higher) so the legislature can\u2019t be overruled by voters against their policies.\n\nSave yourself, out of stater, before they try it in your state government!",

Before I met my wife I literally didn\u2019t even have a bed, I had a couch in my room I slept on.  I wore clothes until they got so many holes in them I had to get new ones, same with shoes.  I worked a creative but low paying job that let me fully express my creativity and work hard every day. Let me tell you something I LOVE my wife, I would die for her, and she loved me and didn\u2019t care that I didn\u2019t make loads of money. But one time we went shopping and I just watched her face, and the heart break she would feel when we couldn\u2019t afford even really simple stuff like eyeliner or getting her nails done occasionally or a pair of underwear that make her feel pretty and it broke my heart in half.  So I gave it up and I work hard every single day and make really good money now. I don\u2019t have a single regret about it and I probably never will because I love taking care of my family more than my own selfish desires.\n\n\nTLDR: you wanna live a simple and free life? Don\u2019t have anyone that depends on you ever. Then who knows maybe you\u2019ll grow old and regret that too?",

My thinking isn't to judge people for inaction, but rather to point out that we must find a way if we don't want to condemn our families to the vagaries of fate.\n\nFate doesn't care that we have to pay for daycare and school and food. We can provide all of things, give our families the perfect life in the short term, while still marching toward calamity in the long term.\n\nI don't like thinking in terms of justifications for action or inaction, I feel like that locks your thinking in. I prefer to think in terms of goals. In this situation the first goal is immediate survival and thriving, the second goal is long term survival and thriving.\n\nI'm not sacrificing the first for the second, but I'm also not using the first as justification to stop thinking about the second. Ignoring the first goal hurts my family. Ignoring the second goal hurts my family.  I can ignore neither.\n\nWith this approach with each situation I am in I look for ways to advance my goals. It could be as simple as not spreading defeatist thoughts around and instead encouraging action whenever I can. Each person I talk to is a chance to prod them in the right direction. It's about maximising the positive force I exert towards my goals.\n\nAs individuals we don't need to be the avalanche, just a single flake of snow within it.",

Changing our own votes or purchases is good, but for it to achieve anything it requires everyone else to get on board. Minds have to be changed.\n\nI have more than one dependent. I have participated in protests. I have communicated with politicians. I look for situations in casual conversations to prod people in the right direction.

She had coworkers with masters degrees making half as much as I did 2 years after my undergrad. The only reason my wife was able to do her job and not live at home was because of our combined incomes. If she worked for the state she would have been able to do basically the same job but with much better work life balance, twice the pay, and great benefits (largely due to the public workers union), but the state jobs require a test which is only given twice a year so she is now getting her masters. \n\nLong story short, depending on the state/country you live in, you can make decent money (you'll never be rich rich) working for the government, while really positively impacting the lives of people who actually need it.",

I mean, it's right and it's wrong.\n\nYes, I daily make concessions. I often think to myself, \"remember: you can't have nice things.\" And that keeps me from getting my hopes up around stuff that's proven out-of-reach.\n\nHowever.\n\nAfter a many years of working just to secure my position in this Capitalist, Corporate, Consumerist hellscape, I have\u2014only in the last two or three\u2014come to realize that I had been making concessions that I _could not stomach_, and which my younger selves would find horrific.\n\nThat changed. Is changing. I am going to do something about this fucking economic system. I am going to set my life against it. I do it for revenge, and I do it for my grandchildren.\n\nThese things I'll not concede.",

Understand that tons of people do too, often in the direction to the opposite of you. That means you need to work your ass off and learn as much as possible. That means maybe your 20s are studying in libraries instead of going out, spending money on a business instead of on drinks, getting yourself into a top grad, business, or law school - or spending your time after work networking with successful people instead of recovering from the day. You have to make sacrifices, not little changes like missing a vacation, actual huge sacrifices like dedicating your months to practice, failure, learning, and building when you\u2019d rather be out with your friends enjoying life. Let\u2019s be realistic: you\u2019re going to fail if you don\u2019t put everything you have out there and cut the fat out. \n\nThis isn\u2019t for everyone, there are plenty of great and perfect goals in life. But if changing the world, or being the best at something, or making a difference is one of them, understand that just as Olympian\u2019s work their ass off, and those people getting into Stanford business school work their ass off, you aren\u2019t going to do jack shit towards those goals without spending your life, and actual hours working towards them.",

America fumbles along the way, but so much progress has been made in a single generation. Things are better. Things could still be even better. But just because a president you didn't vote for lobbed a drone attack at another country doesn't mean the institution is broken. Settle down.

Though we have a few options to vote for you can tell who are the two biggest options that are only worth voting for because the other parties will not amass enough votes to come close to winning. I would understand if 75% of people wanted to leave the EU but you are very close to having half of the population against it living in a country that is going through a decision that is directly harming our economy. It always hits us folk first before the elites and people who have what they need.\nThat's why people complain about democracy because it's a system we are suppose to have a say in but we are so disconnected from the process and we definitely get played with. Do we really know what we are voting for? It's pretty evident that popularity, social media presence and propaganda all affect how people vote. Democracy should be faceless and your vote should be based on policies, if the winning parties policies are not followed through there time in office should be terminated and a disqualification should be enforced from further elections for a set amount of years to prevent abuse to the system. \nYou see it all the time in the UK, MPs and prime ministers say one thing and do something else and the reality is not close to their original scope of ideas. \nI get where you are coming from just my thoughts on the matter.",

I've only been drunk a handful of times in that sort of environment and it fucking sucks and ruins the experience. I like drinking at home because it's quieter and cheaper, and I have my personal space, good food, and bed to sleep in after without needing to travel. Much more enjoyable haha",

He\u2019s a felon, he had it rough at a young age while our parents were poor but for me we were poor when I was 9 on. He\u2019s carried a lot of resentment for me going to school, excelling at work and just generally escaping the circle of abuse, instability and chaos. \n\nHe\u2019s been out 5 years nearly and hasn\u2019t had a job longer than 3-6 months due to his anger issues in my opinion. At least when he\u2019s drinking he\u2019s somewhat self aware. He\u2019s stopped that and is just an agoraphobic asshole nowadays. Woe is me at every turn. \n\nSorry for the text dump, I\u2019m eating breakfast after waking up hungover and your comment felt applicable. Boutta clock into another 8 hour day and then be off for two days. Done worrying about whether this grown man can nut up. \n\nHe always calls me a bitch for really unleashing over the phone, gamechat or whatever method. It\u2019s because of his tendency towards violence his life is fucked. It\u2019s because of that I can\u2019t tell him this face to face, man to man. Im no goody two shoes. I\u2019ve done my number of drugs, crimes as any good fuck up does but I wake up regardless and clock in. \n\nWe all gotta do it if we wanna eat. He\u2019s got a kid on the way and I think that\u2019s what finally made me snap on him when he couldn\u2019t control the conversation and got into his usual abuser habits.\n\nIf I have a kid I\u2019m gonna break that cycle. It\u2019s gonna be when I\u2019m stable enough. I\u2019ve worked 10 years this May to reach the point of a salary and benefits and I can be proud of that. He should be proud of me.",

I had no odds of succeeding, based on my circumstances. Born to a 16 year old high school dropout, parents divorced, childhood was really rough at times, parents struggled with substance abuse, but we went to church so at least they could all pretend they were good people. (Praise Jesus lol) \n\nI had an amazing influence in my step dad. He\u2019s a legitimately kind, calm, even tempered man. He had a much nicer, albeit humble, childhood than my mom and father. And what a good dude for marrying my mom when she had a 6 year old and nothing else to her name. \n\nAnyway, due to his and my sweet grandparents influence I ended up joining the military, going to college, avoiding teen pregnancy, and ended up doing alright for myself. I\u2019m going to be a surgeon in the next few years, married my absolute soul mate who is a 10/10 in every way, have slight financial stability, am super fit, overcame my own alcohol issues, and am finally planning for a baby this year at 32. \n\nThat whole realization that I didn\u2019t want to fuck up some little person really changed things for me. I try to be a better person every day. It\u2019s really important to reflect and remember your roots, and to wake up each day and choose happiness and success. Don\u2019t let your brother dim your light. I\u2019m sorry he couldn\u2019t be more influenced by you. He\u2019s hurting, but it\u2019s easier to mask that with anger.",

I think it's because the code of chivalry was a patriarchal concept that promoted the idea of women as inferior and in need of protection by men. It was also overly idealistic and unrealistic and promoted a level of behavior and ethical conduct that was (and would be) difficult to uphold in real-world situations. It also reflects feudal society, where the privilege and power of the noble class was upheld, and the poor and lower class are not considered in the code, and it could be used as an excuse for the oppression of marginalized groups.",

            "comment": "I was wasted at a Giants/Eagles game at MetLife and since Philly was visiting and is only like 1.5 hours away, it was overrun with Eagles fans. Since this is a rivalry and the Giants sucked this year, it was bound to get ugly. Just our luck, we had a loud Eagles fan behind us (they all are loud TBH) and was screaming \"pussy!\" and \"this shit is too easy!\" as the Giants defense was efficiently dismantled and steamrolled. My dad and brother were trying to hold each other back from jumping him because they knew it was not going to end well. I was near-blackout wasted and without a word I stood up, turned around, gave the guy a huge hug and said \"hey, I'm just happy you're not from Dallas.\" My dad said the guy got a huge kick out of it and quieted down for the rest of the game. Anyway, I hate football and I'm a happy drunk (horses on the left).",

While he was there, the young Spanish court artist Diego Vel\u00e1zquez painted The Triumph of Bacchus, or The Drinkers (1628-29). Surrounded by a drinking party of older rugged-faced men, the young Dionysus is placing a crown on the head of a younger man, who kneels for the honour. Five of the figures are amazingly lifelike: very contemporary but also timeless, their faces and clothing telling so much about them. On 22 July 1629, King Philip IV paid Vel\u00e1zquez 100 ducats \u2013 a goodly sum \u2013 for this painting. ^[Source](https://eclecticlight.co/2020/11/09/god-of-the-week-dionysus-bacchus/)\n\n^[Still-Image](https://i.imgur.com/hgEaMR9.jpeg)",

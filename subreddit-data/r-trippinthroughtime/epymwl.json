That is why when he commands you to kill you son, you have to do it. That is why when he advises you on how to own slaves, and the acceptable amount of beatings for them, you listen to him. God loves us when he says that a woman shall be silent in church, and must obey her husband. When god sends two bears to maul 40 children to death for calling one old guy bald, he was just being fair. When god sacrificed himself, to himself, to forgive us for a sin another dude commited, it's because he is smart, reasonable, and he loves us. The imaginary friend in the sky truly is great.",

The implication  being  non-israelites had foreskins so that means he had killed all these  guys  from other tribes and cut off their penis.\n\nLater  King David has his commander and friend killed so that he can take his  wife because David saw her bath and thought she was hot. (yes David had  multiple wives and sex slaves because that is what traditional marriage  is)\n\nSeveral times when Israel  conquers another local tribe god commands  them to kill all the women,  children, and even their animals so there is  nothing left of them.   Sometimes god tells them it is ok to keep the  children as sex slaves.   (concubines as the book likes to call them.   Those were real popular in  the old testament)\n\nOh yeah in  another place god gives instructions on how it is OK to  take slaves  from other tribes.  You just can't take slaves from israel.   Unless  they own you money, then they can be your slave for 7 years.\n\nAnother talks about a woman lusting after penises that were the size of donkey penises and had emissions of a horse.\n\nGod has a bear maul 40 children to death because they made fun of a guy for being bald.\n\nGod commands to murder gay people.\n\nThe  bible lists a test for a woman that is faithful.  The priest gives the  woman a potion of dirt from his floor and makes her drink it.  If the  woman has been unfaithful she will get sick and abort her baby.  If she  is faithful nothing with happen.  The only place the bible mentions  abortion is a recipe to kill children.\n\nThe  bible explains that if you want striped animals you can get them by  tying two ribbons of different colors together, and then having the  animals mate while looking at the two ribbons.\n\nHumans  decided to build a tower (in Babel) so high that it would reach in to  heaven.  God became afraid that they would find him so he made each of  them speak a different language so they would be confused and stop their  project.  This is how multiple languages came about according to the  bible.\n\nThere are two sets of 10  commandments in the bible.  The only set that actually has the phrase  \"10 commandments\" in it is the set that includes laws like do not mix  milk and cheese.  Somehow Christians never want to put this set up in  court houses.\n\ntalking donkeys is just the beginning.  The book is brutal, filled with genocide, violence, and rape.",

God then tells him to sacrifice his son (naked dude on table). He immediately goes to do it and God's angel says \"it's just a prank bro!\" and then old dude goes on to have more kids than anyone ever. Or something. His name is abraham iirc.  \n\nSource: grew up being forced to attend church services",

                            "comment": "The interesting thing, whether you believe it happened or not, this story is part of many of world events occurring today.  Abraham is one religious figure that Islam, Christianity, and Judaism all agree in.  Because old dudes wife couldn\u2019t have kids, he slept with another women and had a son out of wedlock.  He was Ishmael.  Old dude didn\u2019t disown him and while stayed with his wife, took good care of his son and mistress.\n\nBut later god blessed old dudes wife and they finally were able to have kids, the first together being Isaac (young dude on the table) followed by many more after.\n\nAll three of the religions believe that god had promised old dude and his lineage that all the land in the area would be his (modern day Middle East and Israel).\n\nBirth right at the time was passed through the first born male son.  Islam, believes Ishmael, to be the bloodline of gods promise, as he was the first born male.  Christianity and Judaism, believe it is through Isaac, the first born male son born in wedlock under gods covenant, and that Ishmael is just the bastard son with a servant girl.\n\nThis sets the stage for thousands of years of conflict.  It is why Israel is still a heated topic of debate.  It is a source of conflict between Islam and Jews and Christians.  It is quite literally a starting point for much of the Mid East conflict today.\n\nAmazing to me how so much world history can be traced back to old dude and who he was fucking.",

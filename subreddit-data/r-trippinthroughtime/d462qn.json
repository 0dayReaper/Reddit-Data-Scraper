Friends respect your decisions and shouldn't try to egg you on. Friends who want you to drink don't actually want you, they just want a drinking buddy so they can get shitfaced. A true friend will love you for who you are, a true friend will love you when they're piss drunk and you're piss sober. Quitting drinking can be hard, you may realize that the people around you who you call friends enable your drinking and are not good for your health. It can be hard but those kinds of people may need to be removed from your life to better your health.  A mantra my father carries is \"not today\" you only need to stop drinking for today, don't worry about all the other days ahead of you, you only need to focus on not drinking this one day, and when tomorrow comes repeat the mantra. I wish you the best of luck on your journey of abstinence \u2764\ufe0f and know you're never alone in this courageous journey of self help.",

You need it out at that point..And eat a slice of bread and a sip of pickle juice.",

And since you might have just given food and housing to the enemy, So 'Swedish drink' became a popular torture, forcing feces water into a peasents mouth with a funnel until they are bloated, and then jump on their stomach and try to 'pop' them to get them to reveal any hidden food stashes. \n\nAmerica was really revolutionary in their statement of private property rights even in the face of starving, cold, drunk soldiers.",

Some I impaled upon the pillar on stakes and others I bound to stakes round the pillar. I cut the limbs off the officers who had rebelled. Many captives I burned with fire and many I took as living captives. From some I cut off their noses, their ears, and their fingers, of many I put out their eyes. I made one pillar of the living and another of heads and I bound their heads to tree trunks round about the city.\" \n\nThe Brazen Bull is debated but that was a crazy painful torture device. \n\nWhen the Munster Anabaptist rebellion happened in the 1500s and the leaders were captured and tortured they used red hot pliers to grab the armpits and drag down and it was said the skin melted away like butter. \n\nHumans are simultaneously capable of the most horrific, and beautiful acts.",

Let me ask you then: what value do you think there is in emphasizing his hypocrisy versus his accomplishments, today?\n\nEveryone who has ever lived has done some bad things, especially noted historical figures who by their very nature had wide-reaching impacts on society. Like, Martin Luther King cheated on his wife a lot; should we always make sure this is the first thing people think of when his name comes up?\n\nIf we always focus on the negative things that people have done, we won't have anything positive left. People are people, including \"heroes\" of history. They have complexities and flaws. I don't have any problem accepting that Thomas Jefferson, a bookish, hypocritical racist who abused the power he had over the people whose freedom he owned, was politically very important to the eventual end of slavery in America. We don't need to qualify it with \"YEAH BUT ALSO HE DID A BAD THING\" every time. It's okay to just recognize that sometimes, people in the past did good things -- even if they had questionable, selfish, or outright bad reasons.",

Getting off topic here, but I'm curious now -- I agree that hero worship is part of human nature (and the literal origin of most classical religions). People need archetypes to idolize or venerate.\n\nIf we can't use historical figures for this purpose because we know too much about them and know they were mostly assholes -- and we also can't use religious figures because we know they're made up and it's irrational to believe in things that don't exist -- who then should we idolize?",

He *wasn't* politically very important to the end of slavery in America - as he aged, his defenses of slavery grew louder and shriller, and he was politically important in keeping alive the delusion of state supremacy in the South. The Virginia/Kentucky resolves were not widely appreciated in their day, but the Fire Eaters loved that shit and they started a civil war. As the wartime governor of Virginia he abdicated responsibility and allowed the British to capture Richmond; he allowed himself to believe that a trade embargo with England would hurt them more than it hurt us; his mismanagement of the Navy was so severe that the country was left unprepared for the War of 1812; and he bitterly clung to his agrarian utopianism, persuading himself that the industrializing nation preferred urban commerce to subsistence farming because of its fallen morality. Fuck Jefferson, Jefferson got everything wrong and was a shitty person to boot.\n\nSo yes, I see your point, presentist personal hypocrisies aren't the lenses we should use to view historical figures, but also, Jefferson sucks.",

He was also a racist in a way that was popular in his area and era, in that he believed black people didn't feel the same range of complex emotions as white people. He thought the humanitarian thing to do was let black people live however they wished in their homeland, free of the overbearing of whites.\n\nDoes this position make sense today? Of course not. But morality isn't a zero-sum game. I'm not saying we should celebrate his racism, but we should appreciate what he and other people of the past did that was progressive *relative to the context in which they did it*.",

He married into the Custis family. His father-in-law died, and his will set out that the slaves be freed once his estate is settled, no longer than five years.\n\nThat dude died in debt, though. Lee wanted to free them, but couldn't afford it. So he had to continue having the slaves work the Custis land until they could pay off the debts. He couldn't find a slave master that he trusted would treat slaves well, so he did it himself. That didn't work out well. \n\nAnyways, he eventually freed them. So yeah. 'Fun' fact for the day.",

They are laid out so our government does not infringe/take away these natural rights.\n\n\nEvery human has a right to speak freely, every human has a right to follow their own religion, every human has a right to privacy, every human has a right to defend themselves. This is natural, this describes foundational parts of the human experience that precede any government. Making sure these rights are not encroached upon is not \"lit\" (aka wild/abnormally exciting), they are the bare minimum when building and maintaining a just and liberal democracy. \n\n\nAny notion that these rights are reckless, debased, or superfluous is, to me, a sign that we have normalized the priorities of an overbearing, bloated, and unchecked federal government.",

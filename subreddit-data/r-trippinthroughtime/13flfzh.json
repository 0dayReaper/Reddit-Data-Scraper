This proceeded to incense the emperor, who then had him clubbed to death. This is all highly unlikely as Sebastian was supposed to have died in 288 in Rome. Diocletian might have been in Rome shortly after his ascension in 284 for like 2 days but doesn't actually do an extended stay there until 303-304 to celebrate his 20 years on the thrown. Also Sebastian is supposedly a victim of the Diocletian purges of the Christians. Which seems to actually have been more a thing he was pushed into at the end of his reign by his subordinate Galerius, who cranked up the purging after Diocletian retired. And in any case, those didn't begin until 299 at the earliest. Before then, Diocletion didn't really seem to have a penchant for religious persecution.",

There's a music bot called rythm that lets you play YouTube audio to everyone. \n\nI find playing either appropriate nature or urban sounds for the role playing bits adds a bit of extra immersion and helps with any silences. The battle music helps keep the tension as it's been specifically composed to be used during action sequences.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing how a game is run there's plenty of videos of people playing it on YouTube. They're often a bit long but I'd recommend critical role campaign 2 to start with as that's done by professional voice actors so they all role play really well.",

It is actual polish music. The music OP is referring to is when usually western composers try to imitate Middle-Eastern music by using instruments and scales native to Middle-Eastern countries, and yes they do often have a woman vocalizing in chest voice which is really the only thing they have in common with the Witcher soundtrack.\n\nPS: I guess you could say that the scales sound similar, but that's just because most Western Europeans and Americans only hear major and minor on a regular basis so anything that is not sounds *exotic*.",

Gordon Wasson and Allan Richardson, a banker and a society photographer from New York, first traveled to Oaxaca, Mexico, in June of 1955 in search of a divine mushroom. There they met Maria Sabina, a Mazatec shaman, or curandera, who shared the psilocybin mushroom with them. Thanks to Sabina\u2019s open spirit, Wasson and Richardson became some of the first Westerners to participate in the sacred Mazatec ritual called the velada.",

She was really into occultism and alchemy, but also often did paintings about her own life experiences and experiences being a woman. One interpretation could be that the painting is about feeling trapped as a woman trying to make a career in a male dominated field. Surrealism was very anti-women (women were seen and respected as muses, but not as artists) so this could be an interpretation of that. But again, it could be something else. These are just my own thoughts after looking at the picture for a short bit!\n\nAlso, if you're interested in Varo i made a [short YouTube video about her and some of her artworks! ](https://youtu.be/qk_jG_IZmyY)",

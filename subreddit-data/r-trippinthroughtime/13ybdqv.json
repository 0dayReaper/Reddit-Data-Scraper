The woman has either fainted and is held by a man feeling her heart (in the nineteenth century the painting was called \u2018a sick Lady, her Husband and a physician\u2019), or she is resting against her lover in ecstasy. It is probably a scene from Renaissance literature.\n\n \\* No joke\n\n[OTHER THEORIES](https://www.rct.uk/collection/403928/the-lovers)",

When they adopt foreign words, they generally change either the spelling or the pronunciation to fit the rules. You don't really have silent letters or words that are spelled one way but sound completely different.\n\nI learned how to read Polish first, and my teachers telling me to \"sound out\" words in English seemed like a complete joke in comparison.",

Growing up, I had grandparents that spoke German, Swedish, and Norwegian. My grandmother improved her English skills by helping to teach my brother and I to read, as they watched us when we were young and our parents were working. A lot of people I grew up with have similar experiences. \n\nFlash forward a few years and one older brother married a Spanish lady and they now have bilingual children and my brother speaks Spanish. Another brother married a Vietnamese lady and they have bilingual children and my brother speaks some Vietnamese (which is hilarious to hear).\n\nPoint is - there was a time in my life where there were 6 languages, English included, represented at the Thanksgiving table. Maybe my experience isn't typical for Americans, but I can't help but feel like there is a rich history of melting pot multiculturalism that is often overlooked in favor of the typical American stereotype.",

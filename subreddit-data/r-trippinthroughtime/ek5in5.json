They were doing all types of gross, inappropriate \"flirting\" like touching them, making lewd comments and gestures, antagonizing them for ignoring or brushing them off, etc. They said they'd kick their asses if they could. I said I was up to throwing hands and went out and told the guys off. The one threw a drink in my face, my friends saw and started throwing punches.\n\n2 - The most dramatic was when a group of guys who were building up to flat out assaulting a trans woman. She fled to the women's room and was freaking out. We called her a cab and told the dispatcher that we needed to know when it arrived because someone was being harassed and needed a quick getaway. Once we knew it was there, the other four in the restroom and I went out swinging to distract them while she made a run for it. These dudes were vicious and I ended up picking up a bar stool and whacking them.",

The blurry image of the devil present in the peripheral, the psychological torment, the score, and the overall mood all just made it a super quality horror movie and is what I like to see in the genre. If only they made more movies like The Witch, Hereditary and (My favorite of 2019), The lighthouse.",

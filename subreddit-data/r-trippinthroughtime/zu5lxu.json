Historically, I guess hotels just sort of went along with it, because it doesn\u2019t really make much difference to them if someone leaves a bible in one of their drawers or not? But like others have commented, they seem to be saying \u201cno\u201d more often these days\u2026 I definitely haven\u2019t noticed as many bibles in hotel rooms as when I was a kid.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gideons_International",

The Gideons' primary activity, along with their wives in the Auxiliary, is \"encouraging each other to do the work of the Lord, focusing on who they are before God, and strengthening the power of their personal testimony for the Lord Jesus Christ\". They are most recognized for distributing copies of Scripture free of charge, paid for by freewill offerings from local churches and from members themselves. This Bible distribution is a worldwide enterprise taking place in around 200 countries, territories and possessions.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/trippinthroughtime/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

Kindest guy you could ever meet, honestly, love him to death. I would typically overhear that hotels with Christian owners would be the ones that accepted Gideon Bibles much more frequently, sometimes once a month. It seems that the upper management/owners of hotel buildings are trending away from being Christian, which makes sense. I suggested once that they should just leave QR codes to the bible, since people would be more curious as to what it is, and actually go to it, and it would use less paper. He is just a distributor, so literally nothing came of it, but I thought it was a cool idea.",

Plenty of 4th-6th century depictions lack the iconic beard, or dress him up like a triumphant Roman emperor or general. A version akin to the modern take did exist (see Christ Pantokrator icon in Sinai, a 6th century painting). It just wasn't universal. If there was a rule, it's that Jesus was typically depicted as looking like whatever locals looked like.\n\nRavenna, Italy was the western Roman capital from the 5th through 8th centuries (and the capital of Gothic Italy from 476 to 540 when the Empire took Italy back) has just about every possible depiction of Jesus on display.",

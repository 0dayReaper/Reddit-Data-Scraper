People with prettier words than me say:\n\n&gt;\tIn Vampiros Vegetarianos three mutant, vegetarian vampires appear mesmerised and huddled around a small bistro table, each feverishly feasting from long straws on a succulent meal of blood red fruits and vegetables. Two hybrid creatures, half rooster and half cat \u2014 reminiscent of those in the paintings of her friend Leonora Carrington \u2014 look on, tethered to their masters and eager to partake in this banquet. A fiery glow emanates from the vampires as they consume their meal and appear to regain a sense of vitality with each sip.",

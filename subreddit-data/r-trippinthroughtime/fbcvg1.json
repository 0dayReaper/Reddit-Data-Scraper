I started to think maybe I never heard the song, or it was a random one off that made it to the radio station that fell off the earth. Then maybe like 2 years ago I had a sudden urge in the middle of night when I couldnt sleep to find that song. I searched and I finally fucking found it. It was real. It was such a huge weight off my shoulders, I was dancing, it was an ethereal moment.",

I'd head it on the radio before getting dropped off for school, at a loud and crowded mall, etc. Could hear the guitar riff, but never enough of the words to piece it together. Drove me out of my mind whenever I heard it.",

I only remembered part of one line, no friends knew what I was talking about, and the station didn't play it again. So I called the radio station and they didn't know either from my small lyric sample. \n\nIt took going to multiple music shops before *one* guy knew from my (slightly wrong) lyric. Turns out it was not a new song at all, but Pepper by Butthole Surfers. So grateful I found that guy because otherwise I wouldn't have looked twice at that band. \n\nLater on I went back to the same dude for an obscure song and found out about My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult.\n\nPeople like that felt like musical mages before the internet.",

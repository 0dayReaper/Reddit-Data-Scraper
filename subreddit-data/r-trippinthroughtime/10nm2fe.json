I prefer the - actually used- nickname of \"war tubas\".\n\nBasically you'd have a set of these arranged at different angles. In the same way 3 people can triangulate the source of a gunshot if all three of them take a bearing, one set of these could be used to determine the flight bearing of an incoming plane, and another could be used to determine the altitude. Operators could tilt these in different directions and listen using stethoscope. By sweeping them in different directions until you heard a plane at the loudest volume you could put that information together to determine direction and altitude.\n\nBasically old-school radar, before radar was a thing.",

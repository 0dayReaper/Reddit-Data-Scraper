            "comment": "1780's English Court gown.  These dresses cost a fortune. She is basically wearing a 100k car.\n\nIn England the court dress code required these hoops for formal occasions, well after they fell out of fashion. By the point this portrait was made the hoops were old fashioned but traditional. \n\nIt also [caused the greatest sin against fashion in human history, hoop and high waisted Regency gowns.](https://janeaustensworld.com/2015/10/24/awkward-the-regency-court-gown-regency-fashion/). No place for your elbows.\n\nEdit: thanks for the award! And I stand corrected - it is a Spanish Court gown, not English as it's a the Spanish painter Goya. (Check out his work!) Didn't realize the Spanish were slow to chuck this style of hoop too!",

All the men immediately get raging erections at her inconceivably wide dress.\n\nBut wait what's this. The servants are sliding across the windows and walls of the foyer. It's Belle that bitch and she has a dress the size and shape of a 30ft sea container. Half the men have fainted and the other half immediately came in their cod pieces.",

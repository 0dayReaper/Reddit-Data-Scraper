I was talking to a girl at a party for most of the night and decided to tell her I think she is attractive and asked if she wanted to go for drinks, she just said \"aw thanks\" then looked at her phone. \ud83d\ude02\n\nEmbarrassed of course, I decide to leave her and go find my mate. A week later my mate is at another party and sees this girl. She tells him \"your mate is sweet and all but he shouldn't do that to girls, he was very creepy\" and she went on a bit of a rant about me and made up a second encounter where I was supposedly once again being creepy despite me being too embarrassed to talk to her again for the rest of that night so I actually avoided her. So that obviously didn't happen and my mate knew she was talking BS because I was with him for the rest of that night. \n\nObviously this isn't going to happen every time but it was definitely a reminder why I don't do it. I've seen my female friends do it all the time, if a guy they don't find attractive comes onto them then he is being creepy but if he is attractive then he is just confident. This is of course is not all women but it is very common and I don't wish to have a reputation of being a creep, word gets around. Don't want to scare you off from trying yourself, just be careful man.",

It happened after a casual joke when we were walking with other friends (one of them noticed, it was more than obvious).\n\nI thought she was just being friendly.\n\n...Even though we were making 4~5 hour long phone calls every week, chatting nonstop on every major social medias, and there was a time she invited me to spend a weekend with her family at an apartment close to the beach. \n\nSince we were into anime, manga (well, we both are pro artists nowadays, so that makes sense), and I got her into Yugioh (took like 300 cards and some decks with me, and she and her sister had their decks), we spent the whole day playing cards, drawing, playing some game on PS2, watching movies, till the point she suggested that we wouldn't sleep so we could watch the sunrise together (she insisted it was a fantastic experience, that we could see it in full view from the balcony).\n\nI remember we were watching a shit horror movie past midnight, and she was so sleepy, she put a pillow on my lap and laid her head down. Clueless me thought it was a common thing girls did with their closest friends.\n\nIt was so boring, she decided we'd sneak out without waking her parents and sister, so she could show me the building, walk a bit to force ourselves to not sleep.\nShe even joked we could use the pool, but it was cold.\n\nHours later, us like zombies, watched the horizon saddened that a thick mist was blocking the sun, so it was all for nothing.\n\n...Months later, after a whole year of pure frustration from her part, she admitted she liked me, and it clicked... \"She wasn't being just absolutely friendly\", my 40 IQ brain concluded.\n\nIt was late though, since she just admitted her interest in me after the fire was alteady extingueshed. It was just her making things clear so she could understand what happened. It was a confusing year.\n\n............\n\nThat, my friends, is what self-deprecation does to you. \n\nI always felt girls deserved better, that I was a piece of shit. My mind was really, really messy.\nI did like her a lot, but my inner demon stopped me from going further, so all I could see was she being friendly everytime.\n\nEdit: typo",

I can speak for most men when I say, 'We want to know, if you are attracted to us!' \n\nHonestly same goes for more intimate things. Most guys want to make a move but aren't sure if the woman is ready yet. Its super weird that guys need to make the first move even though women are the most likely to reject an advancement.",

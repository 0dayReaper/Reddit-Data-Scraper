His contemporaries described Paul as \u201dshort, fat, bald and quick to anger\u201d. Not to mention that the preferred means of too-lazy-to-walk transportation was donkey at the place and time. So\u2026Paul got kicked in the head by a donkey? Sounds better. Thank you for steering me in the right direction!

La Follette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._La_Follette#Legacy). Also known as \"Battling Bob,\" he was a firebrand progressive, and he was from **motherfucking Wisconsin.**\n\nThis is a man who won 16.6% of the popular vote when he ran for President as a third party, more than almost any other third-party candidate in US history, on a ticket that included government ownership of railroads and electric utilities, stronger laws for labour unions, and an end to child labour.. He opposed the measures that limited freedom at home and overextended US reach overseas during the Second World War. He publicly denounced a fellow senator who attempted to bribe him early in his career, a move that could've been political suicide. He rammed a bill through the Senate and then attacked it for compromising too much on what he wanted it to achieve (railroad regulation). He spoke on a 19-hour filibuster, at the time the longest in history. Teddy Roosevelt compared him and his National Progressive Republican League to John Brown. After the First World War he fought vigorously for self-determination and an end to imperialism. He has a *town* named after him in Wisconsin.\n\n*This* is the progressive tradition of Wisconsin. From the Civil War, when the black-hatted Midwesterners were known as the \"Iron Brigade\" and fought alongside their fellows from Minnesota and Illinois to achieve the highest casualty rate of the war, she has *carried the flag* for democracy and socialist thought in America. The machinations of Walker and his motley assortment are an aberration, and like all their ilk across America they will fall before the march of the left.\n\nSo of *course* he's from Wisconsin. Wisconsin *knows this shit.*\n\n/rant\n\nJesus Christ, I did not mean to write that much.",

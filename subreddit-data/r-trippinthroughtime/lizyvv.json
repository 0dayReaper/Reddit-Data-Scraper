Has a balanced composition and very vivid colors. I wouldn't be surprised if it was painted by a master aswell. \n\nSame with the top right. Also looks intentional and meant to be humorous. It also looks like its just a small section of a larger painting.\n\nOnly one im not sure about Is bottom right. But it could be  part of a larger theme of a painting where all figures and animals are distorted \n\nI dont think most of the artists who paint these intend to create a realistic painting of a cat.\n\nEdit: turns out top right is a master piece by Fernando Boterno who is actually known for his cat paintings and sculptures. His work is absolutely outrageous and I love it.",

Realistic painting was certainly the trend for quite a long time after artists were nailing down those *painting* techniques, but it seems to me that most laypersons just assume that art falls into one of three categories: 1) Really really old, where nothing looks realistic, 2) really old, where everything is realistically depicted (lol), and 3) modern, which is terrible because it doesn't look realistic. \n\nThe parent comment is a good example, where they say these are \"bad paintings\"- I bet if we asked them to unpack that comment, the root of \"badness\" is that they're not realistic.",

Imaginative realism is even more difficult because then you have everything real to deal with and them unreal things need to be portrayed realistically. That said its also requires considerable talent to develop a cohesive and imaginative method of illustrative stylization but that often isnt as as strict as doing something totally realistic. Even with a camera obscura an untalented artist wont get good results. Drawing is 100% the easy part, everything that happens after that is matter of talent, and that includes color theory and composition.",

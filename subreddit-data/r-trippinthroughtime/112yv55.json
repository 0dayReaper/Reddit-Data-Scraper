She has this whole bit about men naming all the things, and if women named things balls might be called something like \"Karen's handful\". And then later does a call back with this exact painting about Karen picking a basket of handfuls. I can't think of anything else looking at this.\n\n\nThe special is so fucking funny, I've watched it so many times and it's still funny. She briefly references her other special \"Nanette\". It's also good but not really a comedy special, more her dealing with trauma and stuff. Also recommend but be prepared for feels. You don't need to watch it first.",

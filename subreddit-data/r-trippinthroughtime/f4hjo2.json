I'm way oversimplifying, but IMO the big 4 have the most coherent and regularly consistent messages (relatively), so early Christian doctors likely chose those to organize under.",

[That's folk etymology for ya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica):  \n\"Veronica (also spelled Veronika or Ver\u00f3nica) is a female given name, the Latin transliteration of the Greek name Berenice, \u0392\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7.

A celebrated saint in many pious Christian countries, the 17th-century Acta Sanctorum published by the Bollandists listed her feast under July 12, but the German Jesuit scholar Joseph Braun cited her commemoration in Festi Marianni on 13 January.\n\nAccording to Church tradition, Veronica was moved with sympathy when she saw Jesus carrying his cross to Golgotha and gave him her veil that he might wipe his forehead. Jesus accepted the offering, held it to his face, and then handed it back to her\u2014the image of his face miraculously impressed upon it.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/trippinthroughtime/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

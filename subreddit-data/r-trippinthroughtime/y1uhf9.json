To the man's surprise, it did not smell of shit, but had notes of oak and cherry.  It was a deep red color, and he steeled himself and took a sip.  It was delicious, and he drank deeply.   \"I have midjudged you, Jesus.  I will tell the others of this miracle!\"  ^17 And so he told the other Pharisees, and they came and gave Jesus a large clay decanter to show them again this miracle.  Bowing, Jesus dunked the decanter into the steaming turd water and filled it, then brought it to them and filled each of their cups in turn.  ^18 And one by one they drank, and marveled at the rich flavor and floral delicacy of the wine Jesus had made from their foul-smelling leavings.  ^19 And Jesus laughed, and said, \"As your disbelief turned into thirst, just as ungodliness curdles into wickedness, so has the wine turned back into piss and shit in your bellies!  For you have been pranked, and now all of the people can call you shit-eaters and piss-swallowers without being themselves liars.\"  ^20 Thus was Jesus crucified, and as he breathed his last breath upon the cross, he cried out, \"Ha, got 'em!\"",

However, an omni-impotent thing cannot exist,  as existing itself would be beyond its capabilities. That would not make it a \"beta\", as a beta fails to excel, but still performs. Underperformance still indicates potency. A society that equates non-excellency with impotence and inadequacy makes me think of Mad Max Fur Road, where \"Mediocre!\" has become synonymous to failure.",

Here's some discussion of exactly that point, although it is, as it says, incomplete.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/AskBibleScholars/comments/v1wxjn/how_does_judaism_view_adam_and_eve_and_sin_the/iapm871\n\nNow I am not arguing against the idea that at least the American version of Christianity has become obsessed with sin and the fall from grace. But reasons for that are outside the scope of this discussion. I doubt most Americans would recognize Christianity from before the Great Awakening, and maybe for a while afterward. And this current strain of evangelical militants is quite recent, not dating back further than the 70s (with earlier roots, of course). \n\nFor your reading pleasure, here's a little info about the Hebrew origin story compared to other cultures. https://people.howstuffworks.com/adam-and-eve.htm",

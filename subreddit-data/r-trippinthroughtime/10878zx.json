She paid me no mind and brought it into her office (we work from home). Next day she screams that there\u2019s a wasp in there and comes to my office and closes the door. \n\nI go check it out and look to see if the window is open, check where a light had been in the ceiling that is now covered with a plastic cap. Couldn\u2019t figure out where it came from until I saw the decoration from the porch. \n\nThere was a nest with about 8 or 9 in the middle of it. I don\u2019t know how she missed them/didn\u2019t piss them off when she brought it in the day before. I grabbed a trash bag to cover it to take out side but it wasn\u2019t big enough. I slowly carried it outside, swearing nervously and chucked it into the middle of the front yard. \n\nWhen I came back in she was crying and cradling our dogs. She\u2019s allergic to them as well.  \n\nShe sat in her office for 3 hours with that nest, not counting them being in the house overnight. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Christmas before last she tore her sclera bending over at a store when an empty display hook got her right in the eye and has had numerous mishaps involving exploding eggs. It\u2019s like she\u2019s trying to frame me or something.",

Basically a bunch of young and rebellious college boys who wanted to change the art world and caused a LOT of controversy with their first few paintings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven Charles Dickens himself wrote a scathing review about [Christ In The House of His Parents](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/John_Everett_Millais_-_Christ_in_the_House_of_His_Parents_%28%60The_Carpenter%27s_Shop%27%29_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg) also by Millais calling it ugly and distasteful for the \"honest\" and realistic depiction of the holy figures of Christ and Mary and her family, wrinkles and veins and all. The core thesis around the Pre-Raphaelite movement was to depict everything in an honest, truthful way. Study nature, leave no detail unpainted. The real beauty lies in truth, even if that means Mary is showing fine lines or Christ's feet are dirty and toenails have grown out. That's why when you look at Pre-Raphaelite work such as this one, it is so finely detailed you could spend hours looking at all of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFun fact! The Pre-Raphaelites were so trashed in their early days that it was only thanks to one man, John Ruskin -- who was a famous and well-reputed art critic -- that they ever made it. Ruskin was the only one to latch on to the Pre-Raphelite Brotherhood and see talent in their work. It was largely thanks to Ruskin's championing of these guys that led to them being successful artists.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen Millais, the painter of this piece, later married Ruskin's ex-wife Effie. They met while Ruskin and Effie were still married, and Millais had come to paint Ruskin's portrait. Imagine stealing the one man you owe your success to's wife! That had to hurt poor Ruskin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's been your boring Art History ramble for the day!",

They were a bunch of rascals -- talented rascals but rascals all the same!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMillais was not the only Pre-Raphaelite star to steal another man's wife. Dante Gabriel Rosetti, one of the OGs of the Brotherhood, was left alone in Arts and Crafts Movementt pioneer William Morris' house one summer to help him decorate his new place. But he was left alone with Morris' wife Jane -- and well, you know how it went from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJohn Ruskin died a virgin (he never consummated his relationship with the wife who would leave him for Millais) and was likely suffering from bipolar disorder, which accounted for his religious zeal and lost some of his reputation in his later years after a scathing review he put out of a new artist's work led to a court case where no one won and everyone left broke by the end of it. Still, he is remembered today as one of the greatest art critics of his time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the way, here is a quote of Dickens' scathing review of Millais' *Christ In The House of His Parents*, whicch is honestly pretty funny!\n\nOf Mary, he said: \n\n&gt;so hideous in her ugliness that ... she would stand out from the rest of the company as a Monster, in the vilest cabaret in France, or the lowest gin-shop in England.\n\nAnd on Christ himself he wrote:\n\n&gt;a hideous, wry-necked, blubbering, red-headed boy, in a bed gown\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that review one of the founding members of the Brotherhood chickened out, and never exhibited his art in public ever again.",

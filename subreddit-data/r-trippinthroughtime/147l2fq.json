Once you go public, you literally have to be profit driven, always chasing increasing profits, and that is legally enforceable.\n\nAfter the news broke that reddit filed for an IPO, I knew this whole thing was inevitable. Honestly, I'm more confused that people are shocked by these decisions. I feel like a lot of people don't understand how the market works.\n\nWhile there are tons of shitty run private companies, they aren't forced to chase ever increasing profits if the owner doesn't want to. A great example I like to use is Valve. Gabe Newell runs the company to still be quite profitable, but many decisions and products they release and work on are not primarily focused on profit but on the actual user experience.",

Anyone who makes a buck knows that you have to make people happy so that they will give you the bucks. Reddit has to care about their users, and they do, but it's sort of a partnership, and the more reddit makes, the more incentive they have to re-invest and make the site better. That's the way capitalism has managed to improve the lives of humans more than any other inventive scheme since the dawn of time, through the implicit partnership that exists between buyer and seller. \n\nReddit has been a second tier social media site despite being primed to be top tier, like Facebook or Twitter.  The public perception of reddit on the whole is very poor, and for good reason. They need to make changes to make this a serious platform that isn't dominated almost exclusively by woke shut-ins. All the people who made their subreddits dark, I bet reddit would love for all of them to take extended vacations from the site.",

Ultimately its the mods that prevent reddit from being a top tier social media site, because they create and enforce ideological capture, and it becomes known as a hivemind cesspool, and not a culturally relevant battle ground of ideas. Not only that but they constitute a higher class of users, where these few users are more privileged than the rest, the general public doesn't want a social media site that makes them feel like subjects in a fiefdom. \n\n&gt; Remember the only value reddit has is it's userbase, killing apps shrinks that userbase, subreddits going dark for extend periods drops reddit in search rankings.\n\nThe number of users on the secondary apps is likely very very small.",

                            "comment": "Reddit is a haven for echo chambers, and we're seeing a lot of that right now, but there is also a couple of real grievances to be made here. \n\nFirst, Reddit has a problem with bots and spam posters, and has for several years. While Reddit's in-house systems have some controls available to admin and mods, those are the controls that the programmers of bots and savvy spammers figure out how to overcome, cheat or exploit. Thus, lots of mods use 3rd party apps and tools to institute better controls and improve their local communities. Getting rid of 3rd party resources will likely make the individual user experience much, much worse than it currently is. \n\nSecond is Reddit's method of ditching what they see as competition. Not necessarily relevant to those of us who aren't following the drama or using 3rd party apps, but still important to the reason for the protests. They *could* have said, \"We're trying to become more profitable for an IPO, so we will no longer allow 3rd party apps or resources, effective 'x' date.\" Suckish, maybe shortsighted, but standard business. Or, institute prices at a fair market value, allowing enough time before implementation to allow 3rd party partners to shift and adjust. \n\nInstead, they just decided to announce a price-gouging access rate using semi-arbitrary figures, with an effective date that doesn't allow for any change in business model for those 3rd party developers. The whole thing reads like something out of the bank and railroad Trust era. Strongarm and bully-boy tactics are actively illegal in the U.S., and I'm surprised no one has been trying to pursue that avenue. \n\nFinally, Reddit's CEO is demonstrating very poor business acumen through this whole process, which does not bode well for the immediate future of the site. As he is being publicly outed as kind of a jackass, he is not showing any sign of an ability to lead, redirect, retract or effectively negotiate with business partners. This will likely sour many potential public investors and can really damage their IPO return. That, in turn, can tank Reddit's overall value and funding, leading to a downward spiral in quality and user experience. Those who follow economics have all seen it before. \n\nAll in all, there are two ways to look at it: 1) If you follow site drama, then Reddit's CEO is being an incompetent little assclown. 2) If you use Reddit but don't give a shit about politics, recognize that the experience and content may be dropping quality significantly over the next year.",

They are incredibly opaque in terms of their genuine reason to the point making idiotic lies and attacking others.\n\nThey don't come out and be adults and say third party apps are problematic because they don't display ads. They don't create a multi tier API system where no ads is a higher price (not $20 million a year) but reasonable and with ads there is no cost.\n\nThey don't even bother improving the functionality of their app before any of this. They don't engage the community, they are just attempting to run rough shot.",

They pay studios to produce content and make their money off the user as they want to see the content.

Netflix can cut password sharing and then drop a super hyped tv show to make you buy it anyway. If Reddit runs off their power users the quality of the site will noticeably be different.",

I do think he\u2019s dropped the bag pretty hard all the same like all these years they\u2019ve done such a shit job monetizing the site to its actual potential. But it\u2019s still been around for near 20 years so it\u2019s doing that much which isn\u2019t cheap\n\nPlus him saying that about profitability was probably a lie anyway since he\u2019s a fuckin liar",

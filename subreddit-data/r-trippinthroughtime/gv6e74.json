The tea wasn't even property of the crown, instead the East India Trading Company.  \n\n\nOther goods like paint, glass, lead, newspapers, and playing cards were just as heavily taxed as tea.  \n\n\nWashington even wrote in June of 1774: \u201cthe cause of Boston\u2026ever will be considered as the cause of America.\u201d However, his personal views were different. He voiced strong disapproval of  \u201cTheir conduct in destroying the Tea\u201d and claimed Bostons's people were upset. After all this tea was private property. Washington being a wealthy person found it's destruction unsettling.",

He did it for the most basic of reasons; one that became a principle clause of our Constitution. All men have a right to a fair trial and defense in front of a jury of their peers. Adams didn't necessarily agree with what happened, having been vocally outraged at the installation of British troops. But for Adams, this was a bigger fight for the integrity of the law.\n\nHe was an incredibly interesting man. I highly suggest *John Adams: American Patriot* by Samuel Crompton or if you enjoy reading things as they were; *The John Adams Papers* edited by Frank Donovan if you'd liked to know more.",

He was the strongest believer in the ideals of the revolution as opposed to \"pragmatic\" concerns like his own property, and he went on to continue the fight in France.\n\nMost importantly, he is to my knowledge the only one who went beyond political rights to talk about social and economic equality. He [proposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrarian_Justice?wprov=sfla1) something like a combination of social security and UBI, funded by taxing big landowners like Washington or Jefferson. The idea was that since the earth belongs to all humans equally, every person is entitled to some of the wealth drawn from it.",

No American businesses were harmed, and those involved went out of their way to ensure no people or other property were harmed. Historians note that literally \u201conly tea and a padlock were damaged,\u201d and the decks of the boats were scrubbed clean as they left.\n\nAlso, the British government afterwards imposed what was basically martial law, while levying a tax forcing the entire city of Boston to pay for the tea. They suspended the constitution and elections, and enacted a law which required quartering of British soldiers. Imagine the city of Minneapolis levying a 5% sales tax to pay for property damage to owners today, and allowing police officers to take over your home whenever they wanted.\n\nThis is such a terrible example to justify vandalism and looting because the founding fathers valued the concept of private property so highly. Even Washington and Franklin disagreed with the party actions because of that, and felt the tea should be paid for. By comparison, business owners may get insurance money but it will be pennies on the dollar compared to lost revenues and the sudden stoppage of cash flow.\n\nEdit: Sources for those asking as well as various articles and writings online that I don't have time to find but a fast Google search should suffice.\n\nColin G. Calloway- The Scratch of a Pen\n\nBernard Bailyn- The Ideoligical Origins of The American Revolution \n\nDavid Armitage- The Declaration of Independence A Global History \n\nRichard Archer- As If an Enemy's Country The British Occupation of Boston and the Origins of Revolution.\n\nThese are just a few.

The guys even went back the next day to replace the lock they had to break open to access the harbor, they replaced a couple other things as well. \n\nThe only similar analogy would be when the protesters trashed the Minneapolis police department. All other destruction since then has been entirely unjust and counter productive to the protest movement",

Everyone in the neighborhood notices the incident and starts gathering around the house. Some call the fire department, some try to do what they can to contain or put out the fire, some just watch unsure or unable to do anything useful. One person goes into the house, takes whatever he can find of value, throws it in his truck, and drives off.\n\nIn my mind, most of these looters and rioters are that thief. The people trying to deal with the fire are the protesters. They\u2019re using the cover of a horrifying situation to do whatever they want. The thief does not represent or reflect the other people there. Calling them out is not inherently an attack on the others. If he says he was doing it to \u201cprotect the items from the fire\u201d or some bullshit, it\u2019s bullshit.\n\nThe looters are the kind of opportunistic assholes that do the same shit at festivals, or after sports games, or at any other rally/protest. They aren\u2019t sending a message. They might say they are as an excuse for what they\u2019re doing, a last ditch effort to get away with it, but that\u2019s just a cover. They only care about themselves, taint the whole protest by giving assholes an easy way to criticize the whole thing (though it is an unjustified criticism), and are relying on good willed people trying to push for change to a better system being tricked to defend them or theoretically lose the cause. \n\nAgain, these people are trying to abuse your good will to their benefit by using the idea that \u201cif they\u2019re a part of the protest, then we can\u2019t punish them as it defeats the protest. And we don\u2019t want to defeat the protest as we need institutional changes to how policing is handled in this country.\u201d But the truth is we can call out these looters for being selfish opportunists AND support the protesters pushing for change. Don\u2019t accept these false dichotomies people attempt to force upon us. The world is a complex place with complex problems and complex solutions.",

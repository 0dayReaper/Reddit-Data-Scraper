I didn\u2019t actually have to meet him, but I did help out as an usher at one of his shows on his first tour back. Most of it was good. Some reflection, some audience participation, and then he went into that LGBT joke. The first one about the bus. It was kind of funny, not really that offensive, but some parts seemed forced. 2 years later and that became his entire bit. I even tried to defend him when people were saying terrible things when he went out with Elon Musk and got Covid\u2026 I just want Dave to drop it and move on. I doubt he will ever apologize for marginalizing a disenfranchised group. Wealthy people gonna wealth I guess.\n\nEdit: This was the most upvoted comment a few hours ago, and I guess the anti-woke crowd found my comments because they can\u2019t handle reality. The guy isn\u2019t funny anymore. Period. If you don\u2019t agree please give me one recent example of something funny he has said or done.",

I love them but there is a certain amount of mental illness that comes with being a comedian. \n\nIf you listen to comedians talk about themselves and the lifetyle they lead, they admit you have to be a little fucked up to be a comedian. \n\nI have heard from multiple comedians \"upper class white kids with a good upbringing aren't good comedians.\" \n\nI know of one comedian that thinks stand up will die out because the only people that can afford to do stand up are people that have financial stability in their lives. So the funnier people are going to come up in other ways (virally).",

Perhaps instead of concluding in what you believe is true just to dismiss or argue it would be more beneficial trying to understand each other\u2019s perspectives as to avoid misconceptions? \n\nAt the end of the day who knows what is subjective and objective, where does one draw the line, does it even exist or is it a construct? All I know is that it is a very complex philosophical topic of much discussion.\n\nEdit: I suggest to try not asking a question you already know your own answer too. That is a rather rhetorically dismissive way of conversing that I believe one should try to avoid if the desire is to learn something new and expand knowledge. Instead try asking a question you genuinely are curious about. \n\nFor example ask: why does OP see it as an objective shift in opinion? Or what does he mean by objectively in this case?",

Those people are gaslighting, they are saying we are not allowed to be angry, partially because they are afraid inside. \n\nBut there are obviously always ways to grow, and in my opinion, cancel culture is just too black and white. although i think it does often times account for apologies and forgiveness, and it's just that people don't want to apologize. But i mean, Chris Pratt for instance. He hasn't really done anything that terrible. The man went to church. Oh the horror. Same with Ellen. She didn't do anything terribly wrong. So cancel culture does go overboard, and tries to blacklist people. When really maybe they just need to be \"gray\"-listed instead.",

Also about Carlin, like people always say how great he is but when I watch his standup there is literally nothing funny about it. It's just incredibly depressing and sad. He just seems like an old man who hates the world and everything about it. And on the one hand I don't really blame him, the world is a fucked up place but isn't the whole point of comedy to take the fucked up parts of life and make light of it? It almost feels like Dave and Carlin had enough bullshit from the world and just started calling it what it is. Not saying that their wrong in their views but it's just sad and isn't funny at all.\n\nAnd yeah I think you're spot on with Key and Peele. You can definitely see the influence from Dave in their skits. I love their skits and think their hilarious but they also aren't quite the same as old Dave. They kind of seem like a Disney version of Chappelle.",

            "comment": "The Psalter of Bonne de Luxembourg is a small 14th-century illuminated manuscript in tempera, grisaille, ink and gold leaf on vellum. It is held in the collection of The Cloisters, New York, where it is usually on display.\n\nThe book was probably commissioned for Bonne de Luxembourg, Duchess of Normandy, daughter of John the Blind and the wife of John II of France, probably at the end of her husband's life, c 1348\u201349. At the time illuminated manuscripts could compete with monastic scriptoria and panel painting as commercially attractive donor portraits. Bonne died of plague in 1349.\n\nIt consists of 333 pages of parchment each measuring 126 x 88 mm. The illustrations are attributed to the miniaturist Jean Le Noir, and include graphic representations of astrological predictions by the Roman writer Marcus Manilius.\n\n-\n\nDeluxe medieval devotional books used images and texts together to produce compelling, spiritual experiences for their readers. One particularly dramatic image confronts the reader from the pages of a book made for a woman, Bonne of Luxembourg, in the French royal family. In the center of the parchment page, on a blue field teeming with scrolling golden vines, the instruments used to torture Christ during the Passion stand arranged for the viewer\u2019s inspection.\n\nIn the center, filling the composition from top to bottom, is a gaping, disembodied wound. Framed with an almond-shaped ring of white flesh, the bright orange-red tones of torn flesh deepen in color closer to the irregular, vertical brown gash in the center. This is the spear wound created in Christ\u2019s side after his death on the cross, isolated for the pious reader\u2019s contemplation. Shown at what medieval Christians believed to be actual size (about 2 inches), the wound dominates the composition while the miniature instruments of torture that surround it seem to fade into the background. Along with the text (a prayer describing Christ\u2019s suffering), and the manuscript\u2019s lively margins, this graphic painting worked to engage viewers in emotional contemplation of Jesus\u2019 sacrifice.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, this powerful image was meant to orient pious readers\u2019 attention to Christ\u2019s body and the physical suffering he endured to ensure their salvation. This emphasis on Christ\u2019s body is part of a larger trend in late medieval devotion known as affective piety, in which compassion for Christ\u2019s suffering held the key to salvation. With its almond shape, vertical orientation, and confrontational placement, the wound of Christ in the Prayer Book of Bonne of Luxembourg might remind a modern viewer of the Eye of Sauron (known from J.R.R. Tolkein\u2019s The Lord of the Rings). Medieval viewers likely overlaid other associations onto such images of Christ\u2019s wound. The change in the wound\u2019s orientation from a diagonal slit to a vertical opening and the isolation of the wound as an almond-shaped device transform it into an image strongly reminiscent of medieval representations of the vulva and the vaginal opening. Similar imagery persists in modern visual culture, such as Judy Chicago\u2019s 1979 installation The Dinner Party. This association of Christ\u2019s side wound with female reproductive organs has connections with mystical writings that eroticized the body of Christ and that emphasized its nurturing and generative qualities.\n\nMore here: https://smarthistory.org/jean-le-noir-bourgot-miniature-of-christ-wound-passion-prayer-book-bonne-luxembourg/",

After the [French Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution), the standard pronunciation in France changed to that of the [bourgeois](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeois) class in Paris, but [Quebec](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec) retained some pronunciations and expressions shared with modern [O\u00efl languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%C3%AFl_languages) such as [Norman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_language), [Gallo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallo_language), [Picard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard_language), [Poitevin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poitevin_language) and [Saintongeais](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saintongeais). Speakers of those [languages of France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_France) predominated among the settlers of [New France](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_France). Thus, they spoke a popular language that was largely shared with Paris, but they had their own habits, words and pronunciations that were not known in Paris which are now part of everyday language in Quebec. \"\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Quebec_French",

Or perhaps baby eggplants in a thick tomato gravy, perhaps with a side of greens pan fried with coconut oil and chilies, and some steamed pumpkins rubbed with a spice mix? Black beans in a yogurt curry? Lentil curries with a gentle sprinkle of melted ghee? Deep fried sago seed and potato patties (sabudana vada)? Little pastries stuffed with lentils, or peas (samosa)? Nepalese-Tibetan shredded vegetable and noodle soup (thukpa)?\n\nAlternatively, Ethiopian cuisine has some excellent options too! Greens with smoked milk, chickpea gravies, lentil dishes (misr wat being maybe the most famous), vegetable dishes and spicy salads, cabbage and potato fry.. nom!\n\n\nOrrr perhaps some Greek classics? Due to orthodox fasting rules, Greek cuisine is packed with vegetarian dishes. Check out fasolada (bean soup, basically a national dish), their take on fainted imam with feta, the spinach and feta pie, lentil and tomato stews, roasted vegetables stuffed with rice and herbs, pan fried wild greens, a simmered dandelion, spinach, olive and feta dish with generous olive oil..",

Actually, I used to hate legumes and most vegetables as well, and that was until I found out that...my parents just cooked them in the most boring way possible (steamed veggies with zero seasoning and legumes from the can right into the microwave) and growing up I assumed that was the only way to prepare them. It took me many years and a life changing decision from omnivore to *mostly* vegan (sometimes vegetarian) to finally understand that you don't have to eat healthy in the dullest way possible",

I\u2019m not vegan (I raise my own quail and chickens for eggs and meat) but I regularly do vegan/vegetarian dinners bc I want my kids to have a broad palette when they\u2019re older and are making their own shopping/cooking choices. I understand veganism from the view that factory farming is a blight on humanity and inherently cruel. I have had vegans give me a lot of shit for raising my own animals but I find it to be a really fulfilling experience, and I think it\u2019s important to know where your food comes from and how it\u2019s raised. I\u2019ve even had meat eaters act like I\u2019m weird for keeping birds but are perfectly comfortable buying a plastic wrapped steak from the store. The disconnect is wild.",

Personally, I wouldn\u2019t raise animals for food even if I had the space/resources but I have a lot more understanding for people who do it themselves rather than defend animal agriculture with no actual hands-on experience with it. For a lot of vegans, it\u2019s not just about the animal liberation or treatment of animals but the environmental aspects, but I\u2019ve wanted my own chickens as a way to help get rid of food scraps/kitchen waste. There is a way to do it. I think just cutting out everything animal based is an easier solution as someone who can\u2019t own animals, if I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s from or how it\u2019s been treated or the impact on the planet, I don\u2019t want to eat it. Plus, there is something to be said for sanitation and the conditions in which animals are kept, which can also be avoided if you raise your own. Again, I couldn\u2019t personally kill an animal to eat it when other things exist for me, but to each their own.",

Two weeks isn't enough time to learn how to shop and cook for a vegetarian diet, and vegan is quite a step further.  Not saying you should retry just to torture yourself, but a reasonable plan would be two-three months to GET to vegan, and a month to try it from there.  Something like a month eliminating all animal flesh and animal fat (except for butter), and about a month after eliminating the fish and rolling back butter until there's no animal fats.  Then try vegan.  Also if you do that and decide it's not for you, you might just end up not eating as much meat, because over that journey you'll find it's often just used as a vehicle to carry flavor.",

It\u2019s kinda cool to prep a meal and think \u201cnothing died for me to sustain myself\u201d. \n\nFrozen vegan chicken nuggets are quite good. Impossible beef is also a really decent substitute for beef. Some meatballs are decent. But then there\u2019s other products that have a long way to go. \n\nIn general I\u2019d say it\u2019s easier to \u201cstomach\u201d if you don\u2019t try to convince yourself this is supposed to replicate meat (despite the obvious marketing attempts at portraying itself as such). It\u2019s just a different type of protein that happens to be meat-like. \n\nAnd finally, for anyone on the fence, there\u2019s plenty of calories and protein to be found in vegan and vegetarian foods, so this meme is kinda misleading.\n\nETA: Like anything you eat, good food prep goes a long way. Baking that vegan \u201cchicken\u201d nugget will get you a much tastier snack than microwaving.",

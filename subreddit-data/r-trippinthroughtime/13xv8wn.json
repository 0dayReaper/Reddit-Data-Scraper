A pund has 14oz instead of 16oz, so you have the right amount there by our measure\"*\n\nLike, why? I would respect the drive manufacturers more if they just said *\"due to manufacturing variability, the size listing is the maximum theoretical amount. The actual amount will be lower, but we guarantee it'll be within X% of the theoretical maximum\"*. By counting on base-10 instead of base-2, they're fattening their specs and confusing the consumer.\n\n/rant\n\nEdit: I really don't care if it's a \"Microsoft thing\". Imo, Microsoft is 100% right here. Computers use base-2 math. The CPU cache is case-2. RAM is base-2. VRAM is base-2. Suddenly hard drives are base-10 because... why? Because \"Tera\" is 1,000 in base-10? Who cares? Computers use base-2. It's dumb to adhere to the strict name instead of the numbers. So, no, I won't be mad at Microsoft here. I'll be mad at everyone *else* for being pedantic over language, over being pedantic over math (the *only* thing worth being pedantic over).\n\n/re-rant",

The Porkinator is an ancient confusion of whirring cogs, spinning blades, and crushing hammers, that nobody has truly understood since the mid-19th century, when it was designed by a cult of food processing engineers in a bastardised mix of metric and imperial that spawned dimensions humanity was not meant to know. A lone worker stands by its side, shovelling coal into its engine, stoking the flames ever hotter as world hotdog consumption increases, demanding that the Porkinator runs ever faster. We could design a new Porkinator, that shoots out 8-packs and doesn't require the yearly virgin sacrifice, but why would we. If it works it works.",

Let me double check before I post this\u2026 shit, that\u2019s 999. What do I even do wrong? I shouldn\u2019t have smoked so much weed in college... Let me see\u2026 Half of 1000 is 500, 250, then 125\u2026 can\u2019t half that. 125 is uhh.. 64 plus 32 plus 16, that\u2019s uhm, 112\u2026 plus 8, plus 4, skip the 2, then plus 1. So that\u2019s 1111101. Double that by adding a 0 to get 250, then two more zeroes\u2026 so 1111101000? That better be right\u2026 let\u2019s see.. aaaand hooray, that is right!

The Tera, Giga, etc prefixes are defined by SI to be powers of 10. Kilo = 1000 (think kilometer, kilogram, etc), Mega = 1 million (megahertz, megaton), Giga = 1 billion (gigawatt), tera = 1 trillion.\n\nApproximating these powers of ten using powers of two (1024 instead of 1000) became wide-spread in computing circles for some time because powers of two are more natural for computers. But it was never correct. And the larger the prefix, the larger the discrepancy between the two becomes. So a kibibyte (based on 1024) is roughly the same as a kilobyte (based on 1000), but a tebibyte is quite significantly more than a terabyte. So this fell out of favor more and more. \n\nWindows never switched from 1024 to 1000, or from the SI prefixes to the binary prefixes. Probably because Microsoft cares so strongly about compatibility.",

During the 19th century rediscovery of Leonardo it came to be considered a masterwork. The theft (and subsequent worldwide press coverage) simply made it a household name. But, it had been prominently displayed in the Louvre since long before it became a public museum, and briefly Napoleon's bedroom, so it was already a famous painting (which is probably why it was stolen in the first place).",

Erotic paintings from my observation, are a way to show the difference between the religious ideology that sex is a form of affection that only a wife and husband (female and male) can have, but with the paintings depicting gay intercourse it shows the whole idea in a different perspective, pretty much breaking that form of religious ideology or supporting it.\n\n(Sorry for my bad grammar)\n\nSource for whoever wants to read more:\n\n[Source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/culturacolectiva.com/art/erotic-paintings-that-show-the-heavenly-side-to-an-orgasm/amp)",

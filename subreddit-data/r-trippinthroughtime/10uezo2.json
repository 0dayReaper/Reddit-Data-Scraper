Personally, most of my use of English is this \u2013 reading stuff and writing messages on the internet. It's fairly rare that I get to speak it with someone.\n\nSo for the non-native speaker, the connection between the written and spoken word is stronger, and the written form is strongly in our mind. For a native speaker, the sounds of the language are there first, and are more prominent. If two words *sound* similar, they're more likely to get mixed up.\n\nThe upside for non-native speakers is that we seem to be less likely to make homophone mistakes like this \u2013 *obviously* \"your\" and \"you're\" are different, \"you're\" is a contraction of \"you are\", for god's sake! \u2013 but on the other hand that can mean our understanding of the language is a little more rigid, and so things like puns can pass us by initially.",

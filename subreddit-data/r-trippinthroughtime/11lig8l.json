It\u2019s the little things that we remember, the moments of delight or outrage or silliness. Guess that\u2019s why I commented at all. It was a happy memory that I alone held since he left and it seemed a small, bright thing wasted. But now, you hold it too. My Daniel was a good, if broken, man, and he did many wonderful things that will never be mentioned in a Wikipedia page. So the shiny jewel: a fine man, comically appalled, grousing about a strange namesake. Remember him fondly.",

After buttoning up a career in the textile industry, Hardman would go on to become a speed walking champion at the local Lodge for veterans of foreign wars four wars ago. Nearly choking on his own tongue at the ceremony, Hardman was able to marry his cousin's second love In spite of her teeth. Other than his last contribution to society when he invented the golf swing with straight arms, this wedding was it. He died of ten different things, take your pick, in 1836.",

The Chinese weather balloon is a result of the Federal Reserve Notes that are being printed in huge amounts. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is the main printer of the United States paper money. They will print a volume of currency which is more than our national debt and more than the United States Treasury. At one time in history there was only a national debt. Now the United States government has two debts: national and debt of banksters. The United States currency is printed on a massive scale and many times more than our paper money of the past. They have printed so much currency they are now printing paper money faster than we can spend it.\n\nThe United States economy is a fractional-reserve system; this is where we have an economy based upon borrowing that is not paid back. The problem with a fractional-reserve system is we don't have any money to repay loans with. We have spent all of our savings and have borrowed beyond our ability to pay back. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York prints money for the United States Treasury. When money is printed, it becomes more valuable and the Federal Reserve sells its printed money to the United States Treasury.",

It gets expensive fast too. I switch to bud for a day or two here and there and only smoke/take edibles at the end of the day anyways. I\u2019ve had Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome at times in my life when I was using a lot of concentrates (mostly dab pens). It\u2019s horrible and I had to quit weed for a while. Thankfully it seems that if I stick to low doses and high cbd stuff, and NOT DAB, ugh, then I don\u2019t trigger the cyclical vomiting. The episodes get worse over time too, and my last episode was 2 months, the last 2 weeks of which were literally no food except broth, and Gatorade and sprite, which I would vomit up still and had to be in the hospital almost daily for IV hydration. It was truly horrible. I hope I can keep thc in moderation in my life just because it\u2019s the only thing that cures my night terrors and sleep paralysis (have tried medications like prazosin which I take but do nothing), short of benzos this is my best bet. I never want to be a huge constant-stoned stoner again though. It\u2019s too much money, energy, and I really think that being such a huge stoner from 17-22 made me slightly dumb compared to before ): it can work miracles but it\u2019s not all benefits all the time",

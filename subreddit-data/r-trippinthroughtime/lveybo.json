Even though it was shit posting in the 18th century, it was predicting the direction that art was going to take, even if it was unintentional. on top of it potentially predicting the future of art, it is ahead of its time with the painting techniques that it used.",

I know there are some college courses that study memes, but most of the normal population doesn't really pay attention to things they don't find funny. This generation finds different things funny than older generations. And the next generation will find something else funny than we do. Memes are inherently tied to the culture of the times to draw on for humor. For example, how often do people look at memes from the 2000s and find them funny? There of course are some classics that keep on living, but many major meme formats have been left behind never to be used again. Like when's the last time you've seen a rage comic?",

It's neat that we all stand on shoulders of giants and that the complex mechanicsms of science often stem from what we used to call philosophy and art because back then.. empiricism and art was the closest thing humans had to science.\n\nIt also demonstrates why it's important to know the history of our fields of study even though they may be outdated, disputed to be factually incorrect, or lacking in intellectual substance. Understanding the thought process, the philosophies these great and novel thinker had gives a roamap to why we know things today.",

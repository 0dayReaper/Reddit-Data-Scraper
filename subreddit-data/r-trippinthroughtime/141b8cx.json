No high is worth getting Hepatitis C or HIV. If you think you feel like crap now, wait until your liver fails or your immune system gets completely wiped out. Dope sick will feel like euphoria in comparison to the hell of Hep C induced end-stage liver disease. When the hepatic encephalopathy starts giving you horrifying hallucinations and anxiety, and the toxins building up in your blood make you feel like your whole body is on fire, you\u2019ll wish you were \u201cjust\u201d in withdrawal. And also, you most likely will be.\n\nOr, you know, quit before you get a batch with just a little too much fent and it kills you. \n\nAnd if there\u2019s someone out there who maybe does opioids recreationally and doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re the type of person that could get addicted \u2014 fent is a completely different thing. Just a few uses within a few days can lead to significant withdrawal symptoms when you stop. As strong as it is, the analgesic effects go away really quickly despite it having a long half-life in your body. You can literally experience withdrawal AND overdose at the same time.\n\nIt\u2019s so easy to get addicted to. You can go from zero to hopelessly dependent much faster with fent than you can with literally any other drug. \n\nIt\u2019s an absolutely horrible drug. Stay away from it at all costs. I\u2019ve seen it rip people\u2019s lives apart in a flash, financially and morally bankrupt them, and oftentimes kill them. \n\nStay away.",

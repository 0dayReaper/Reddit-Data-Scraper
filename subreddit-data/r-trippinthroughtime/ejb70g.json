                    "comment": "Something I discovered a few weeks ago and is 100% real. Eating a girl's ass who has attended a music festival, preferably a all day long festival in the middle of summer heatwave, is by far the most enjoyable experience. First, the heat and humidity provide a hot, sticky, and succulent environment for the asshole and crack. Second, she's obviously been outdoors all day using port a potties with cheap toilet paper, so wiping isn't nearly as good as like home. Cheap paper will leave behind remnants and residue. The heat and humidity liquifies the remnants and mixes with her pussy discharge, and it creates a most succulent, delicious, and scrumptious asshole flavor. Third, all of the constant dancing and the heat trapped in her crack from being underneath underwear and tight shorts just add to the flavor. I would literally eat ass like this on a daily fucking basis.\n\nYes, I'm still on tren.\n\nEdit: Unfortunately I cannot take credit for this abomination, the original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/cpst94/offtopic_daily_chat_20190813/ewrcruo)",

Something I couldn\u2019t imagine myself doing but then I met her. Literally the moment I laid eyes on her bare ass that night in the shower I began to long for the moment I would be nose deep in her ass crack drowning in her fumes. People always want to talk about taste and smells but that ain\u2019t it man. That moment nothing like that even crosses my mind. Her energy is leaving her body and violently convulsing through mine. It\u2019s incredible. I now love eating ass and day dream about it quite often. There\u2019s just nothing like it.",

She is incapable of doing any wrong and is his saviour from the pressures he faces, his emotional pillar. \n\nThis man holds this ideal near to him and is always in search of her. As he grows older he realizes that she is nowhere to be found but continues his search. Eventually the weight of his own expectations for this perfect woman begins to weigh him down.

One of the more requested strippers had a tattoo of a very detailed cat on the upper inside of her thigh where the leg touches the pubis area and the cat had a very looong cartoony tongue that snaked up the pubis to the very top of her vagina and ended in an arrow right above her clit hood. Underneath the cat itself were the words in all caps \"IT'S RIGHT HERE!\"\n\nShe said that she got tired of having to teach men where it was so she was thoughtful enough to leave them instructions \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

Like really up close and I got to see *everything!* It never occurred to me at that moment to think about \"nakedness\". I was just crying because I felt emotional at the beauty of giving birth; I was also very pregnant at that same time. So, seeing her strip was nothing to me. I was just there to clap for her and be her cheerleader, while also making sure that she was safe while going home.",

We might have something closer to world peace if humans had never started creating magical stories of gods and goddesses to explain to themselves why their world worked the way it did. Because then we end up with cults started by pedo conmen that today is worth billions of dollars (LDS). The best and quickest way to earn tax-free money is to create a religion! Just like L. Ron Hubbard and Joseph Smith!",

When I\u2019d ask him to go down on me or even TOUCH me down there, he would get this twisted fucked up look on his face, get all self conscious and then angry. Told me \u201cI don\u2019t know why you need me to touch you to get you wet.. or go down on you.. kinda fucked up you need that\u201d referring to fore play. Like sorry my pussy isn\u2019t just drenched after 2 minutes of you shoving your tongue in my throat. Told me he was self conscious of his OWN HANDS and felt like he was doing a bad job regardless of my coaching and active encouragement. Dude would love it tho when I would go down on him for a half hour and happily jizz down my throat and then tell me he\u2019s tired now and doesn\u2019t want to have sex. Told me that with blowjobs that good, he doesn\u2019t even need to fuck me. I\u2019m a nympho tho and need it till I\u2019m sore. I\u2019m single now.",

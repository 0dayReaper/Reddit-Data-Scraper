As in: \"two households both alike in dignity\". You can emphasize the pattern and it sounds da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM.\n\nOne of the more common errors for beginners acting Shakespeare is to fall into that pattern and make their dialog sound singsong as a result.  Not 100% of the dialog in Shakespeare is in iambic pentameter, and sometimes he stretches the definition to make things fit, but most of it is.\n\nBasically it's why Shakespeare sounds like Shakespeare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was common in sonnets, and Shakespeare was a poet before he was a playwright and sonnets were his favorite kind of poem; he wrote hundreds. He also slipped sonnets into his plays sometimes. In Romeo and Juliet there are three: the Prologue, the part when Romeo and Juliet first meet, and the prologue to act II.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's a nice page that goes into sonnets, the way iambic pentameter works, and so on: [https://owlcation.com/humanities/Three-Sonnets-in-Romeo-and-Juliet](https://owlcation.com/humanities/Three-Sonnets-in-Romeo-and-Juliet)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: iambic pentameter is the rhythm that makes Shakespeare sound like Shakespeare.",

Then Middle English started showing up after the Norman conquest when a lot of Norman/French influences we're being introduced. Modern English actually started around the time of Shakespeare. Obviously there have been changes in the words we use and the way we use them over the past few centuries, but the language at it's core has been mostly the same for a while now",

If you're going to say things that may make you sound interested to some, don't be surprised that they'll think you're interested. I \"hate to break it to you,\" but sometimes you're going to have to be upfront and stop hiding behind meaningless responses and hints, and just say that you're not that interested in their kids/cats/dog/yoga/crossfit stories. Otherwise you'll just have to sit and listen to it.",

So scratching their belly is a violation of trust. Do you have cats?",

I'm not addicted though, I just can't imagine ever being without them, you know?

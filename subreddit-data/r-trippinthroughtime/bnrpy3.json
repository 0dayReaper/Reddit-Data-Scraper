            "comment": "I was doing a regular pest control service for mice (filling outside bait stations) at a house for the Vice President of an underwear company (i'll let you  guess which one) who had Bernese mountain dogs that roamed the property.  The older dog (one of two) was very aggressive and would often try to sneak up on me while i was bent over checking bait stations for activity. It got to the point where the dog would lunge at me every time i turned my back on it. The older dog's personality soon rubbed off on the new puppy who started to emulate it. I was forced to call the homeowner's wife and ask her to lock up the dogs so i could do my service because i was forced to fend them off constantly with a large flashlight. She repeatedly refused, saying they were harmless and wouldn't bother me. The last straw was when she refused while watching them bite the tires of my van and lunge at my door. This kind of customer is the epitome of  \"has more money than brains\" in our industry.",

I knew someone whose dog was shot and killed by a stranger that it had run up to (while unleashed). The distraught owner then went out and adopted another dog that turned out to have even worse people aggression. I used to enter animal abuse cases into the system at the legal office I worked in, often involving dog on dog attacks  due to dogs left unrestrained or uncontained that went after someone else's (often leashed) dog. Some  people are just chaos magnets, I think. They never learn,  it's never their fault, and their dog must have been provoked, etc. I've come across cases (yes, plural) wherein the owners of a dog that severely injured their own child still insisted that the dog would never hurt anyone. Hello, half of your kid's face or leg is missing! All due to pure neglect on the owners' part. Pay attention and train/control your pets!",

I'm hiking in a pretty popular hiking spot with my shepherd (on a leash) that I'm trying to train to be friendlier around other dogs. Turn the corner and there's this pitty mix sprints up to my dog and starts sniffing his butt, from the front. My dog is understandably a bit miffed that this dog is rummaging around near his genitals and starts to growling at him and this dog just doesn't back off. So I basically tackle my dog to keep him from biting the other dog and then this dog decides now that  my dog is incapacitated he's gonna start growling and snapping at him.\n\nI look up and this dude and his girlfriend are just nonchalantly staring at a map like a quarter mile up the path. My dog starts loudly barking while I'm struggling to keep him from wriggling free and the guy just kind of slowly jogs to me and is like, \"oh, sorry my dog doesn't really respond to me well when he's off leash around other dogs...\" and I'm just like, \"neither does mine, that's why he's on a fucking leash\"",

Finally she gets up and picks him up, telling me that usually he's really friendly. My dog could have easily killed your dog you cunt!",

Best thing to do is build up their confidence with lots of praise and treat them for ignoring triggers entirely.\n\nTLDR make sure to consider your dog\u2019s situation and emotions when training and always let them know when they\u2019re good boys",

He willingly let a person approach and pat him the other week.\n\nWe are making similar progress with dogs, he has the same reaction.

He was still a \u201cpuppy\u201d, and I think he got excited or something, but it startled me because of his size. He was taller than me standing! I backed off tho, and she just gave some nonsense \u201coh I don\u2019t know why he barked at you, he\u2019s very friendly, etc etc\u201d. Lady, if your dog can\u2019t handle strangers yet, don\u2019t let them pet him! That\u2019s why I asked! Saw her again today as I parked my car and she milled around for awhile. I waited til she was gone to get out.",

So he's acted defensive against people (mainly males), but he hasn't bitten anyone, and seems to be fine once he realizes that the person is okay. \n\nSomeone came up to me with my dog barking at him, and asked if he'd bite. I said \"man, idk, he hasn't bitten anyone yet but I don't wanna say he *won't* because he's never acted like this before\" because again, he didn't start acting like this until we moved, but he will usually still give someone a chance. However I still tell people to be careful and pet him at your own risk.\n\nThis dude starts petting my dog, puts his head to his and looks him in the eye. What do you think happened?\n\nThat's the only person he's tried to bite, he didn't actually get him, but still. I felt really bad but I'm not sure *what* to feel or what I should do about it. I feel like I should have told him to just stay away but I don't know how that would affect how my usually super friendly dog sees the people in my area.",

Stiffness and hard staring are precursors to aggressive behavior.\n\nOntop of that, you must keep absolute calm both mentally and physically and not give your dog a justification for his suspicion.\n\nIf someone new wants to meet your dog, tell him or her to go down to the dogs level, sitting sideways, not making eye-contact and not acting stiff and nervously and letting the dog approach.\n\nThis method significantly increases the chance that your dog will have a positive reaction to the new person.",

I don't think all of those cases are because of bad rearing. I'm sure it plays a role but it's absolutely not the only factor. \n\nNow when it comes to breeding.. Yeah, pitbulls have historically been bred to fight, and that is indeed the fault of humans. The thing is, you can't just yank those instincts out of your pitbull and the breeding has been going on for a long time. It's literally in their genes and that's what makes pitbulls unpredictable. \n\nI don't care at all how sweet a pitbull acts with their owner, I'd still never leave one alone with kids or pets. Honestly I'd avoid it even with supervision, because once it decides that one of my cats is a chew toy it's already too late. I can't do anything about it and the owner can't either. \n\nI don't know why so many pit owners defend them so hard. Never experiencing or witnessing a pitbull attack does not mean they don't happen and the numbers speak for themselves. Feel free to love your pitbull but don't expect everyone else to share those feelings.\n\nEdit: And yeah, obviously every single pitbull isn't going to be aggressive. But the breed is the most aggressive one by far.",

From 1979 to 1988, 157 dog bites related fatalities occurred (70% being children) and Pit Bull Terriers were involved in 41.6% of cases with German Shepherds being the next most commonly reported species\u00a0[10]. Deaths caused by Pit Bull Terriers increased from 20% in the 1979/80 period to 62% by 1987/88 and at least 25 breeds of dogs were involved in human deaths from 1979-1998. However, Pit Bull Terriers and Rottweilers were accountable for more than 50% of cases\u00a0\n\n&gt;Attacks by Pitt Bull Terriers were associated with a higher median Injury Severity Scale score (4 vs. 1), higher risk of an admitting Glasgow Coma Score of 8 or lower (17.2% vs 0%) and a greater risk of death. Compared with other breeds of dog, attacks by Pit Bull Terriers were associated with higher morbidity, hospital charges and risk of death\u00a0[9].\n\nCharacteristics of 1616 Consecutive Dog Bite Injuries at a Single Institution.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27400935/?i=10&amp;from=\"pit%20bull%20bite\"\n\n&gt;This single-institution study of 1616 consecutive dog bite injuries over 4 years Pit bull bites were implicated in half of all surgeries performed and over 2.5 times as likely to bite in multiple anatomic locations as compared to other breeds.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29184724/?i=8&amp;from=\"pit%20bull%20bite\"\n\n&gt;Of the 56 cases that had an identified dog breed, pit bulls accounted for 48.2% of the dog bites, and 47.8% of pit bull bites required intervention in the operating room.\n \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/30473254/?i=2&amp;from=\"pit%20bull%20bite\"\n\nOne-hundred and two patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 5.84\u202fyears, and 43.1% were preschool-aged (2-5\u202fyears). Parental presence was reported in 43.6% of cases, and most attacks occurred in the evening (46.8%). Injuries often involved the head-neck region (92.1%), and 72.5% were of major severity. Pet dogs were responsible for 42% of injuries, and pit bull was the most-identified breed (36.2%). Most injuries occurred while the child was at home (57.8%) and was petting or playing with the dog (28.4%). Intervention in the operating room was required in 34.3% of patient\n\n\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/25638634/?i=13&amp;from=\"pit%20bull%20bite\"\n\n&gt;650 dog bite incidents, 282 met the criteria for inclusion in the trauma database. Median age was 5 years (range, 2 months to 17 years) and 55% (154/282) of patients were male. Pit bulls were most frequently responsible, accounting for 39% (83/213) of incidents in which dog breed was documented. Fifty-three percent (150/282) of dogs belonged to the patient's immediate or extended family. Sixty-nine percent (194/282) of patients required operative\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\u00a0Pediatric dog bites span a wide range of ages, frequently require operative intervention, and can cause severe morbidity. Dog familiarity did not confer safety, and in this series, Pit bulls were most frequently responsible. These findings have great relevance for child safety.\n\nThere are 35 more studies, should I post more?",

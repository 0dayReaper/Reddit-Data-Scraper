To my understanding, theology has to do with interpreting or understanding aspects of a particular religion (I assume both in a historical context and in interpretation of scripture?). Which, I would think, means you're studying in a field where you're always going to be wrong... as in, religion, especially Christianity, has a bajillion different denominations. So of course you're going to face people who believe your interpretation and understanding of the religion is wrong, whether they are Christian or otherwise.\n\nYou might be able to pinpoint certain historical things down to record, but the tenets of the religion itself as a matter of something to believe in and follow, I don't see how you would break through to indisputable fact. Unless you were focusing on a specific argument as to what the beliefs/teachings were at a certain period in history and/or in its origin.\n\nI would think it's closer to philosophy than the sciences? Where it's more about making a persuasive argument or discussing historical perspectives on the subject, than it is about proving something indisputably?",

I also lack knowledge on interwar Poland so i won't be covering them much.\n\nThere are a few background factors that you have to understand to see why these countries acted the way they did; namely the great depression and the trauma caused by WWI. The economic turmoil of the great depression gripped all of these countries hard during this time, even though they were on the path to recovery. This made re-armament both harder to pull off and a less attractive of an option.\n\nIn addition, France and the UK had just lost an generation of their young men on the battlefields of WWI a few decades earlier. Neither country was too eager to send a another generation to their deaths, so re-armament or any sort of intervention was politically extremely unpopular among the populace. The USA on the other hand had embraced isolationism and thus they couldn't care less about European affairs. It took a direct attack on US soil to drag them out of this in 1941.\n\nIn addition to these dire domestic problems, the Germans also played their hand quite well. They had mostly hidden the scale of their re-armament until 1935, giving the French and Brits less time to rearm themselves. In addition, they had more or less tricked the French and Brits to believing that Germany's only goal was to unite all the German people's under one state. Thus they didn't see Germany's early expansion into German majority areas like Austria or the Sudetenland as too worrying. This \"Appeasement policy\" proved to be a fatal mistake in 1938 however, when the Germans took over all of Czechoslovakia, directly going against their promises to Britain. At this point, the Brits and the French weren't ready enough on their re-armament nor did they have the political support to intervene.\n\nHopefully this shed some light for you, as you can see there was a ton of factors playing into why the French and Brits didn't make their moves earlier. The USA on the other hand was completely uninterested in European affairs due to isolationism.",

Both feature a massive amount of interesting movements and individuals duking it out for a wide variety of goals. You can easily spend hours reading about their goals, stories and where they eventually ended up (spoiler alert; most of them didn't end up too well).\n\nThen you have the new nations which emerged from the end of WWI. All of them treaded quite different paths and some ended up enduring up to this day while many of them were wiped out soon afterwards. Really dramatic stories there.\n\nCountries like France, Britain and the United States also faced severe economic and political turmoil during this period which led to a bunch of interesting stuff there too. If you are less interested in the grand scheme of things, you could also look at the cultural and technological progress at the time which was also very rapid.\n\nI could go on and on about the wonders of this relatively short period of time. There is nothing more interesting than a world trying to find it's footing after a massive war and all the economic and political turmoil that comes alongside that. It all leads up to the grand finale of WWII too so knowing all the backstory helps enhance your experience when reading about WWII.",

Obviously didn't address other points I had made... \n\nI usually hit then back with the \"well if I'm the idiot, then explain -insert the dumb point they made- to me?

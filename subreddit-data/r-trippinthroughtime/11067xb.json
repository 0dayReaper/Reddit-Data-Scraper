I am a pothead and also have travelled a little and I think that changed my risk tolerance about things like that.\n\nSmall quantity of pot should be less than $100 bribe, but it has to be handled on the spot or a nearby ATM. If they bring you to the station it's gonna cost you a lot more and you just might be proper fucked. It helps an infinite amount to speak the language, too.",

My mate had already bought coke off the street without us knowing and pulled it out in our hostel, so we did some and it was average. We went out that night and said we don't want any more, lets stick to weed and drink. We had literally got about 20 metres from our hostel and our mate is talking to a group of dodgy looking dudes trying to get more coke. He comes over to us and says he needs some money, do we want to chip in. We said no, so he walks back over to these guys and gives them the bad news. Next minute we're surrounded by 4-5 guys demanding something like 100 euros for wasting their time. \"Your friend owes us\" one said.  I said \"walk\" and we briskly walked away with them following right behind us. We walked for a few minutes and then they stopped following us, like they had come across an invisible line. We were told later that that was likely the edge of their territory. \n\nWe were not too impressed with our mate and we steered well clear of that part of town the rest of the trip.",

The reagent is made by creating antibodies (proteins made by an immune system) that have an affinity to stick onto the drug in question when in a mixture/solution with it. The synthesis and production of these antibodies are a bit beyond my scope, and I couldn't tell you how the LSD reagent at my lab was produced by the manufacturer, but you can read about common techniques here:\nhttps://www.proteogenix.science/scientific-corner/antibody-production/antibody-synthesis-development-new-drugs/\n\nWe had these screening tests (referred to as immunoassays) for several drugs. In fact immunoassays are a very common method for many clinical lab tests beyond drugs. The issue with drugs though as that they are pretty small molecules, and depending on the drug their structure can have a lot in common with other drugs (false positives were very common and accounted for in my lab, but not all labs have the means to confirm immunoassays and will result them as \"presumptive positive\". They should anyway...). The antibody of the LSD immunoassay test did in fact have a higher affinity (it was more likely to bind) with fentanyl. \n\nOur barbituates immunassay also sometimes rang false positives for something in patient's blood, but it wasn't in our mass spec library so I didn't know what it was. I just knew when I would confirm it on our lcms it would not show up.\n\nImmunoassays sometimes show \"low positives\" or weak readings, usually near the level of detection. We would shoot these through the lcms too and often the signal/peak of the drug would be small or low quality so it was not reliable enough to report as positive.",

Didn't dare to even look for it in Singapore.\nBut yeah I just wouldn't buy anything synthetic. Except maybe for coke in south and middle America if I actually did consume it.",

If you are the one initiating the approach, there is a monumental less risk of it being a setup. \n\nCops, thugs, etc, are predatory and gain their goal by looking for targets. If you eliminate that process, there is way less risk.\n\nYou just need to get past the awkwardness of asking for drugs. Use common sense for safety and who/when you think it would be appropriate to ask. \n\nSource: I love doing drugs when I travel",

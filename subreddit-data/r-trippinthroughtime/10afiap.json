I had a broken spine and was on opioids and 8 other daily medicines. My dad died and my wife\u2019s mom died close together and I began to ask questions. \n\nI had a psychotic break and sought out therapy. I wanted help and off the medication and I wanted to get my life back. I discovered psychedelics. My doctor was willing to help me process my trips. So much can be said about those trips and I barely have the words to begin. \n\nMy life changed. I got good help. I weigh 265 lbs today. I\u2019m opioid free, 3 years. I\u2019m on zero medication. I am a stay at home dad now. I did have a very difficult 18 months. I made some sloppy decisions and didn\u2019t have a lot of support, mainly because people didn\u2019t understand me using psychedelics. After that time though, life is much better.\n\nMy wife is currently going through therapy and getting good help. We grew up in the same church and we have been together since we were kids. She understands now. We had to start over. Thankfully our kids are great and we\u2019ve been self aware enough to be honest with them and we have been good parents. But we have struggled supporting one another. The good news is, we refuse to quit. \n\nLife is getting strange for all of us now. Not just me. If I could give short advice, LOVE with INTENTION. Control yourself by Balancing your Mind and your Body and your Soul. Wake up slowly.",

Albert Camus?\nSpecifically he wrote in his essay, The Myth of Sisyphus, There is only one really serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide,\u201d so claims Camus in his essay The Myth of Sisyphus. By starting with the question of whether life is worth living, Camus places the problem of how we are to live our lives squarely in the center of his thought.\n\nFor many people, a life without meaning is not a life worth living. Camus understands this and tackles the problem head-on. He concludes that suicide is of little use to us, as there can be no more meaning in death than in life, and turns to questions of what makes life worth living. When it comes to what meaning we might find, however, he is of little help.

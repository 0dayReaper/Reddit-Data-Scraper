Some historians say that the institutional roots of Byzantium begin with Diocletian, others say Constantine, still others say Heraclius some hundreds of years later. But even if we push the beginning of \u2018Byzantium\u2019 to this time, the empire lasted from 640 CE until 1453 CE. If we include back until Constantine, that makes it even more impressive: 337 CE - 1453 CE; over a thousand years of Roman history. A lot of people tend to minimize Byzantium to a footnote of classical Rome, but over at hundred years of continued existence in some form is no easy feat, and easily exceeds the span of the Republic and the Western empire by a rather hefty margin.",

There was no Eastern and Western Rome for them, just Rome. When the Western part fell, Rome was still there. An empire is defined by much more than a capital (Rome even shifted it several times before the \"split\")  \nThe same as todays France are ancestors of the Franks despite them not owning land they origined from.  \nWhen Germany was divided and one of both would have \"fallen\" the remaining one would still be Germany... as it actually is.",

Those two aspects of Roman history are just that - Roman - but they have different flavours and themes that necessitate some form of categorization. However I do wholeheartedly agree; the Roman Empire ended in 1453, not \u2018Byzantium\u2019 as we would understand it. It\u2019s unfortunate that history has not been kind to the Basilea Rhomaion in terms of their rightful legacy as THE Roman state, but it is what it is.",

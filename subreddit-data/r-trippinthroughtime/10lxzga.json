Too bad because a ton of things like old letters from great grandparents and etc are in cursive so people lose out on that now. It certainly has applications if you want to be a historian, but I think these days more and more new important things are popping up in education so fast that they might have to get rid of things that are too niche or obscure now.       \n\nI don't understand how people can't read it. The letters are mostly the same shape as normal letters. People can't use context clues? Like I can see how someone might not know what that lowercase r is in learning, but the rest of the letters are pretty much the same. Wouldn't it be common sense?",

They are just portrait paintings with really exaggerated expressions/characteristics and are kind of like the old master equivalent of caricatures. Whenever I have a bad day I love to look at them for a laugh, some of them are really goofy :)",

But there is less and less need for cursive at all, so it is being taught and used less. The only thing I \u201cneed\u201d it for is a signature, but that\u2019s a personal preference in most cases. I saw a video last week where a teacher is helping a young child who was reading and he saw a lowercase \ud835\udc20 and asked \u201cwhat the hell is that?!\u201d - I hope someone shares it because it\u2019s hilarious.\n\nEdit: Found it!\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Unexpected/comments/109h24n/a_proper_response/",

Normally, cursive should always be faster (all other things being equal), since your pen barely leaves the sheet and each letter flows into the next. Writing in print letters basically means you write each letter one by one. You can be fast at that, but I can't imagine it being more efficient than cursive.",

Just kinda flew under the radar in my class of ~30 kids, so I mainly wrote in pretty sloppy print letters until I was a late teen. I was getting into bullet journaling at the time and felt embarrassed that my handwriting was so bad, so I went back to basics. My handwriting\u2019s a kinda weird mix of both print and cursive depending on what letters are easiest to write and remember in the moment. It\u2019s still not the _neatest_ or _prettiest_ in the world. But, that comes down to issues like me getting distracted by spelling mid-word or forgetting what I was going to write (ADHD is fun. Yay.)\n\nFor a while my signature was a stressful *thing* that I couldn\u2019t figure out despite all the adults in my life telling me that it was easy and to not overcomplicate it. But I could not-not overthink it. I filled out a notebook with me trying to write my name in cursive faster and faster until it \u201cclicked.\u201d It never really did. Maybe my name\u2019s just too long, idk. I compromised by quickly writing the first two letters of my first &amp; last, and then doing a little squiggle after each to represent the rest of my name.",

I was fully ready to play the whole \u201cback in my day\u201d when my 7 year old ran into cursive for the first time but she didn\u2019t even stumble a bit and read the whole block of text. I think there may have been like 1-2 letters that she didn\u2019t know immediately. I\u2019m sure the heaviness of the font comes into play though depending on how italicized and crammed the letters are",

And yeah, it is not as funny, of course \"this one guy in a bridge stopped a whole army until someone stabbed him in the balls from below\" is eye-catching, but it doesn't really tell you anything other than \"this thing happened\". Like, it's still knowledge and it is valuable, but it doesn't tell you why crossing the bridge was such a big deal in the first place.",

It's faster than print, but it loses legibility much more quickly than something like italic calligraphy, which is also very fast if you know how to use it, or print, which is probably fast enough for most situations. There seems to be this assumption that if you were just a better person, your cursive wouldn't be all wibbly, but actually, it just is not easy to maintain legibility in cursive, *especially* if you are using it for speed.",

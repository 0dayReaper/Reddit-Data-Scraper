Apparently it used to be viewed as a way of achieving atonement for your crimes, and some criminal would go into with hot attitudes and interact with the crowd even during the torture.\nThat's probably unrelated to this though, I'd bet this is just a case of the usual abstract quality medieval art has. Still interesting though.",

This podcast is amazing--what the commenter alludes to is that the atonement piece of this theatre was *highly desired* by onlookers. What they saw as someone was being tortured to death was their earning a definite seat in heaven. They were in fact envious of the tortured subject.\n\nDan goes on to essentially argue that public torture and executions laid the foundation for our modern sense of empathy, which is fucken wild.",

You can pretty much count on Dan to tell the more compelling and interesting version of a story, even if that version has been debunked.\n\nFor example we\u2019ve known for a long time that the Gavrilo Princip sandwich story was false. In fact it appears that the story was made up for a Brazilian historical fiction novel about 20 years ago. But Dan wanted to wax philosophical about fate and how fortune intervened to put the Archduke in front of Princip, so Dan repeated the story about how Princip had given up and gone to buy a sandwich. In reality Princip had analyzed the likely routes for Ferdinand to return across the city. He positioned himself at the corner of a major intersection next to the Latin Bridge which was a few dozen meters from his original ambush spot. But apparently a smart forward thinking assassin didn\u2019t mesh as well with the theme of fate and destiny that Dan wanted to use in that episode. So he went with a fake story that\u2019s well known to be debunked. When it suits his narrative Dan will dip into historical fiction rather than history.",

He often oversimplifies topics and uses questionable sources because they make a good story and can still technically be a citation. I appreciate that he makes people more interested in history but if you just listen to him and laud that fact he may be better than your public school history teacher without pursuing your own research afterward you're just doing yourself a disservice. \n\n[Here's a succinct summary from r/askhistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ppmsm/thoughts_on_dan_carlin/cd4qedu/), one of the most heavily modded subreddits in terms of keeping this relevant and accurate. Again, I'm of the same mind as u/Celebreth in terms of him being overally a positive effect, I just hope people use him as the stepping stone he is meant to be and not an actual academic.",

Ppl think this is only a problem in Mexico...NOPE, many are living here and many chicanos are in these cartels as well. It's because of them alot of ppl think all Mexicans are criminals, yeah sure, go ahead and blame Trump for that or maybe blame the psychopaths killing and raping without any remorse.",

Victims we\u00adre placed inside, usually with their tongues cut out first. The door was shut, sealing them in. Fires would then be lit around the bull. As the victim succumbed to the searing heat inside, he would thrash about and scream in agony. The movements and sounds, muted by the bull's mass, made the apparatus appear alive, the sounds inside like those of a real bull. This effect created additional amusement for the audience, and served the added benefit of distancing them from the brutality of the torture, since they couldn't directly see the victim.\n\nOr Scaphism\n&gt;It entailed trapping the victim between two boats, feeding and covering them with milk and honey, and allowing them to fester and be devoured by insects and other vermin over time.\n\nOr a pyramid spike thing.\n\nSo eff\u2019d up",

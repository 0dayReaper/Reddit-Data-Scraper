While I could still sense my waking body, I also saw my friends on a football field where something tragic happened. After the vision was done I was still kind of trapped there. I thought it was a seizure and talked to my doctor who agreed it was probably a small seizure but not to worry about it. YEARS went by before I finally learned about sleep paralysis and felt like a huge weight was lifted from me knowing that I didn\u2019t actually have a seizure (or see the future.)",

Second time, tho, a shadow in human form detached itself from the corner of the room and came to crawl up and sit on my stomach and proceeded to stab me over and over in the chest. I wasn't really scared just confused and sort of fascinated because it didn't feel like a dream but a hallucination. It wasn't until I realized that I had had my room completely blacked out that I \"woke up.\" I always left a little light in my room when I sleep after that lol I didn't learn about sleep demons until much later",

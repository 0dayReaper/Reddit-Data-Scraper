Can't believe I need to say this, but: do not touch AC power lines, there is still a high risk of death or injury.",

There are modern DC long distance lines, I've done some work on the parts where they crossed bodies of water. They need a fair bit of ground work with special clays and such so they don't overheat.\n\nThe thing with long distance DC is that the transformer stations are expensive as hell but the upside is that the two sides aren't coupled in the same way as with regular ac lines. So there's more room for smart grids and fine control.",

The reason electrocution was involved *was* because of Edison\u2019s experiments to prove AC current was more dangerous than DC (which it kind of is, in some ways), but Topsy was actually sentenced to execution by the bigwigs of the circus due to her having killed three men. Originally, the plan was to hang her (and sell tickets, the bastards), but that got changed after the ASPCA objected to invitation/press-only and the more \u2018sure and humane\u2019 mess they went with instead.\n\nAgain, Edison wasn\u2019t actually involved. It\u2019s still a terrible story of animal cruelty and objectification, and Edison was still an awful jackass who experimented on animals for the sole purpose of advancing his business, but this one thing he\u2019s clear of.",

However, the two paths the electricity has are through bird or through wire between bird's feet.  Most of the electricity goes through the wire and only a tiny amount goes through the bird, so it's fine.  \n\nNow if the bird touched two wires, the electricity still has two paths.  It can go aaaaalllll the way down the one wire, go through whatever it's connected to (probably a transformer) then come aaaaalllll the way back down the other wire.  Or just go through the bird.  So most goes through the bird and very quickly you have crispy bird.  \n\nThis is oversimplifying, but gets the point across.",

AC.\n\nwhy is it always the weird shit that ends up as the most upvoted comment?\n\n&gt; On October 11, 1889 John Feeks, a Western Union lineman, was high up in the tangle of overhead electrical wires working on what were supposed to be low-voltage telegraph lines in a busy Manhattan district. As the lunchtime crowd below looked on he grabbed a nearby line that, unknown to him, had been shorted many blocks away with a high-voltage AC line. The jolt entered through his bare right hand and exited his left steel studded climbing boot. Feeks was killed almost instantly, his body falling into the tangle of wire, sparking, burning, and smoldering for the better part of an hour while a horrified crowd of thousands gathered below.",

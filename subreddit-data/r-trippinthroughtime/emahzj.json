I was waiting for my parents to pick me up. The couple started play wrestling on the floor of the basement in front of me and I felt super awkward. Especially because I didn't know them that well. I was shy and they were 2 years older than me. I also had a crush on the guy at the time so that made it all the more fun. \n\nFYI, it was a band party, so the whole marching band and color guard were invited. I wasn't cool enough to get invited to a party otherwise, especially one with juniors/seniors as an underclassman.\n\nEdit: The picture looks just like me sitting on the couch while they're cuddling on the floor and I don't know what to do.",

It was 1999 so it's not like he had a mobile phone to pass the time or whatever.\n\nNothing happened that night, a little bit because of that guy, a lot because a friend of hers was knocking and screaming behind the door \"bitch I told you to close the door on your way out, now someone's gone and stole all my weed!\", which kind of ruined the mood and the melody.",

Yeah that morning was the biggest test of my temper and politeness of my life. I threw a party and told people they could stay over, but only this girl I had a bit of a crush and another friend-ish stayed over. They made it very clear they wanted to sleep alone (they hadn't been together before this night) and they slept on the couch in the middle of the living room while I went to my room to sleep. That night kind of sucked, but I just thought fine, they just found each other they'll have a cozy night and they'll be gone early tomorrow. Wrong. \n\nFor some reason I woke up at 8, and found them cuddled up on the couch, trying to just ignore my feelings I snuck past them to get some breakfast and I thought I'd watch some office and they'd leave pretty soon as they woke, which they did at that time. They stayed and cuddled in that couch for 3-4 fucking hours, and the very few times I had to leave to get something in the kitchen or go to the bathroom they seemed SUPER annoyed and interrupted, in my living room. Like I was the one who was supposed to leave our just stay locked inside my room. Add to this the fact that I had feelings for the girl, I was so damn close to just telling them to get the fuck out and it's beyond me how they despite the best hints I could come up with just stayed right there when they were obviously very annoyed by my presence, in my house. I eventually made up some shit about having to leave to get them to go lol.",

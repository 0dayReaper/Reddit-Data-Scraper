A portmanteau of moustache and November and it\u2019s a month dedicated to raising awareness of mens health and mental health issues and a lot of people grow crazy moustaches to get money to donate to mens charities. \n\nOn the news they have segments encouraging men to seek help should they need it, information on resources, men sharing their personal stories etc. \n\nMuch better. \n\nAlso, masturbation is good and healthy. Unless you have an addiction there is zero reason to stop, keep yourself healthy by wanking lads.",

During the series, the older son Lance came out as gay and dealing with that issue dominated the rest of the series. Maybe on PBS, because gays were still invisible on commercial networks? But that very well could have triggered downfall of \"Lance.\" \n\nBet very few American girls were named \"Karen\" in the past year.",

Indian women are servants to their husbands and their in-laws. Japan considers it a national crisis that women don't want to marry and have kids.  \n\nChristianity is just one example of universal misogyny.  And name a country that doesn't exploit women for sex.  Denmark is supposedly very socially advanced for women and their rights, but Copenhagen has African women working the redlight district, forced into prostitution.  Doesn't stop the Danish men from doing business with them.  Amsterdam now has women working the red light district who were trafficked from Eastern Europe.  It's the same everywhere.

So they were already bumping uglies before the temptation. Plus, the fruit is said to grant knowledge of good and evil, not pleasure. The serpent specifically says that the fruit will make Eve akin to god himself, which when coupled with the \"good and evil\" bit suggests that it will give her secret knowledge of the cosmos. \n\nSecond, the punishments are not exclusively sexual in nature. Eve suffers painful childbirth, but Adam suffers arduous food collection. Specifically, Adam is required to toil in the fields for his food, which was previously easy for him to access. \n\nIt seems likely that the punishments are meant to describe traditional gender roles and their challenges, but it seems unlikely that the temptation was sexual in nature. Most likely, the story is meant to explain why human lives kinda suck if there is a creator god who cares about humans. There had to be some mythical justification for why that god created a shitty existence, and the explanation arrived at was that humans tried to take the god's power. This theme is repeated in the Tower of Babel story.",

The story of the Garden of Eden is meant to explain why we did that, and thus, why we suffer the way we do. It uses the things they noticed about how we are relatively unique in their necessarily narrowed worldview. \n\nThe ancient Semites that invented the story were looking at everything wrong with their present lives and extrapolating backwards to try and explain how things came to be that way with the assumption that we must've fucked up somehow because God cannot be at fault in their mythology.\n\nI know the risk I'm taking here, but in a weird way, I actually think there might even be just a smidge of truth to that idea, but please note that I'm not justifying misogyny, not even a little bit. It's just that it makes sense that men might've felt pressured to provide safer environments for women and children. This doesn't mean that Eve, metaphorically or otherwise, should be assigned blame. It means that men, in a patriarchal culture, made the conscious decision to submit to being ruled by others if it meant that his wife and his offspring had a better life, a better chance of survival. \n\nEarly monarchies basically universally claimed divine right of rule and I think that is a factor in understanding this story. They were, in effect, telling the people under their rule that they themselves take the place of God in their lives whereas, previously, God had provided for them in the Garden. The king provides and he does so in such a way that lions aren't picking us off every time one of us goes to take a piss. That's great until he decides that your wife is now his concubine and you and your son have to march 150 miles to fight a war over gold or whatever other bullshit reasons the Elite have come up with to get us to kill each other. So once things started to go to shit, and the horrible consequences of their decisions began to rear its head, they placed blame on the women who had pressured them from their own patriarchal point of view. After all, the men, who had taken the place of God, were just as infallible as God, right?\n\nI've read a lot about this and there's so much more to say. I haven't even scratched the surface really.",

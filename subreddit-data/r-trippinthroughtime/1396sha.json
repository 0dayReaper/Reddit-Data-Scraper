I live in a rural area (yes of course that has its own drawbacks) and look at the stars almost every night.  \n\nMany times I use one of those apps that tells me what star or planet it is, and the constellations etc.  I just enjoy it, finding out many of the brightest \u201cstars\u201d are planets. \n\nI feel like it\u2019s a strong drive in the human experience, to enjoy the night sky.

It's a problem that's easier to get rid of than something like oil or plastic pollution (it goes away at the speed of light!), but the hardest part is simply spreading the word and properly educating people. The international dark sky association has a great website with resources to help educate yourself with. It takes one light at a time!",

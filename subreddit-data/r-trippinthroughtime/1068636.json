While I usually had one weekday shift per week and a Saturday every other week... it was summer. Library was super busy so I picked up 3 \u201cmidi\u201d shifts which are basically just 3 hours during the busiest part of the day. And picked up a weekday shift for someone going on vacation. So Monday midi Tuesday full Wednesday midi Thursday full Friday midi Saturday full. We are closed on Sundays but my family has church stuff so basically I was working that day as well. On my second week of this schedule it was my Saturday off and I was so ready to sleep in. Welp. My DAD gets a call at 8:30 am from my coworker asking me to come in for her. Not a single call to me and I would need to be there at 9:30 am till 5pm. I cried but she bullied me into it. I have chronic ankle pain and could barely walk that day so I was crying from that too. I was sent home early and a children\u2019s librarian did the rest of the shift because I could not function. \n\n\nLater when my boss tallied my hours for pay she realized I was way over the hour limit and asked why I worked that Saturday too. I told her about my coworker calling my dad and she stopped me there. \u201cI know you\u2019re new to working but your coworker should not be calling your dad instead of you for scheduling. Why does she have his number?\u201d For the record she had it so she could call him to reserve some of his free range eggs. But yeah that coworker got a talking to for that and I was told not to take extra shifts while I had the midi shifts since I would be over my allowed hours and too many of that and being over too much would get my manager in trouble even if it was shift switching and not her scheduling me then.",

I worked at a Kroger deli in one of the busiest stores in the city. Towards the end of my time there it wasn't uncommon for me to go two weeks straight with no off. Even if I did I would see one of the managers show up at our station and look at our schedule sheet. I would know then that my day off was axed. This was also when I was pretty much working frying and baking chickens single handed and trying to keep up the pace with everything. I now work at a more chill place. The pay is less but I'm hardly stressed out or overworked. Hopefully it got better for you.",

They decided to just arrange the summer section and children events schedule better to not create sudden surges of angry parents who can\u2019t find their kid\u2019s summer reading book that the other 400 kids on their grade also have to read. EDIT: actually the school made it easier on us too. Instead of kids needing to pick one from 4 specific fiction books and another from 4 specific nonfiction books, there\u2019s a website to look for recommended books based on your kid\u2019s grade and reading level so now they can really read whatever they want as long as it\u2019s grade appropriate and one fiction one non fiction.

The thing is, I'm *extremely* comfortable at work. I work third shift. I'm in front of a computer, in a literal basement, all night long. My inner goblin is living the dream. I am goblin mode, all day, every day, *especially* when I'm at work. \n\nMy colleagues have been nothing but respectful the few times I told them I couldn't cover extra shifts. And the pay has been good when I did. Goodness knows my household would be doing far worse right now without the extra income. \n\n**However,**\n\nThis is part of why I encourage people to look out for their personal interests and take time off whenever they need it. There are several people here who are completely unreachable on their off days, and I root for them! The money is the icing on the cake; the cake itself is that they have higher morale from having a better work-life balance. Because I work when other people (friends, family, etc) are asleep, the ball is in my court to choose when I sleep. I try to sleep as soon as I get home in the morning so I'm all rested up by the time everyone else is just getting out of work, and I can be there for them. Or, if I have pressing errands to perform, I'll do them before I go home. \n\nI realize *intensely* that I am the exception. I am **thrilled** to be that exception. Please call out, blow off those texts, passively encourage your boss to hire someone who is BUILT to gobble up all the excess time and leave your schedule stable. It'll be better for everyone if they correct their staffing situation, and it won't happen unless they are SUFFERING UNTIL THEY FIX IT.",

One of his summonings requires, along with other ritual trappings, that he provide a humanoid type of body for the demon to inhabit while it's briefly in our realm.  (He also has to provide booze and tobacco as a kind of tribute, I think.)  \n\nSo he summons the demon, which wakes up in its temporary body and is immediately pissed because the only even-vaguely human body Dresden could find for it was a cabbage patch doll, but in resignation, the inhabited doll takes a swig of the booze, pops the provided chewing tobacco into its little doll cheek, and plops down, sitting like the woman in OP's pic, legs straight out ahead because cabbage patch knees don't bend, and says grumpily, fine, what did you need to know.\n\nI enjoyed that scene in the books, and pictured the demon looking almost exactly like OP's woman, but smaller and not as fat.  And chewing tobacco.",

He mastered realistic painting when he was 14 so he had to keep experimenting to keep things interesting.\n\nBesides even his primitivist and cubist exhibit a lot of artistic skills and mastery of technique if you examine it closely. Picasso also went through a lot of different periods and he reverted back to a realistic neoclassical style for a bit in the 1920s.",

Hilarious. \n\n\"The tongue-in-cheek way of using a weasel for the portrait of Cecilia Gallerani is made apparent when you come to know that the woman was the mistress of the Duke of Milan.\n\nThe Duke had hired Leonardo to do the painting of his then-pregnant 16-year old mistress.\n\nThe 15th-century painting\u2019s use of a weasel is also said to represent the mistress\u2019s last name Gallerani, which can resemble the Greek word for ermine \u2018galay\u2019.\u00a0\n\nSome also believe that the weasel is a representation of the duke himself, given how the weasel is strangely muscular and masculine and how the lady is touching it.\"\n\nI imagine this Duke standing over Leonardo's shoulder, saying...\"maybe a little bigger? But not too big? Maybe a little bigger than that. A bit more.. KEEP GOING I AM PAYING FOR THIS!\"",

The ermine was his personal emblem. He died in a dungeon after being captured in battle in France. She lived a long and happy life and had 4 more children. \n\nThe portrait disappeared for a few hundred years until it was bought by Polish prince Adam George Czartoryski, visiting Italy in 1800. He gifted it to his mother Izabela Czartoryska Flemming who changed the background color from blue to black and had Leonardo\u2019s name added. Along with the incorrect title La Bele Feroniere, thinking the painting was another version of Belle Ferroni\u00e8re in the Louvre because the models look very similar.\n\nThe painti bounced around Poland and France until it was put in the Czartoryska museum in Krak\u00f3w in 1878 which was founded by Princess Izabele Czartoryska. It resided there until it was moved to Germany during WWI then moved back in 1920. Germany seized it during WWII, and it bounced around Germany and Poland in the hands of the Nazis until the Allies discovered it and sent it back to Krak\u00f3w. It has since been sent on exhibitions and has traveled more extensively than any other Da Vinci painting. \n\n(I filled in some details from the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_with_an_Ermine?wprov=sfti1)",

So, in our drunken state, we called it Mags and Chi Chi.\n\nSo every night, we'd stumble to the floor with Mags and Chi Chi and talk to it like an old friend.\n\nFast forward to this past Christmas. \n\nWe finished our basement, and each of us has an office. Needed noise canceling panels. \n\nSaw Lady with an Erime panels and thought I'd won the Christmas lotto. I knew it would make him laugh.\n\nTurns out, so did he. We both got each other the same thing.\n\nThat is how I ended up with a surplus of Lady with an Ermine noise canceling panels. \n\nThe end",

Tiniest little beady black eyes but adorable. \n\nThe ones here in the rocky mountains are called stoats during the summer when their fur is brown and ermines in the winter when it's white. They are a lot smaller than the guy in the picture. A lot of species of weasels turn white in the winter and they all get called ermines.\n\nThe stoats here are vicious predators. They will find a den of marmots or other small rodents, murder and eat them all, and then keep the fur to line their newly acquired cozy winter home.",

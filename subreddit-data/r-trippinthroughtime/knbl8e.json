That stuff would literally take hours per building and our 3 building iterations were always changing.\n\nI wrote an excel sheet in about 10-12 hours that made a 2-3 hour process done in seconds. I sent that shit out to my classmates cuz fuck having to do those calculations over and over again. My ball park guess is that form saved 200-300 work-hours that semester and probably more if anyone passed it on.\n\n[This magnificent sheet](https://imgur.com/a/xScYBE5)\n\nEdit: Here is a link to the sheet so you can see how awful my code was lol. It worked, but was a bashed together mess that somehow worked. Expect errors tho as this was made in excel and dumped into sheets without fixing the conversion issues [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gbr6pM1XTvBpEuHE0-t4Maqa9\\_rZJGhH/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gbr6pM1XTvBpEuHE0-t4Maqa9_rZJGhH/view?usp=sharing)\n\nNow I use excel to analyze and interoperate stock data. This shit is like crack once you learn how to use it!!",

I wrote some software years ago to help determine staffing levels based on some datasets. There was scrutiny initially, but after a while people more or less assumed it would be accurate. The dataset changes over time though, and assumptions made 10 years ago may no longer be true. If no one maintains it, it's just a ticking time bomb. Now extend that to AI making Healthcare decisions without a human really understanding why and you realize it's already happening",

Well Apple made a good touchpad then Microsoft introduced Windows Precision Touchpad drivers which made touchpads mostly useable on Windows laptops.\n\nI just wish Microsoft takes their endeavors seriously rather then only doing it properly after Apple does something.",

All the while, Stacy is still expected to perform all work at 100% capacity because no manager saw fit to actually allocate Stacy's time in a way that would actually allow for a detailed accounting of every feature, workflow, column, etc. that would be necessary to migrate to the new system.\n\nThen a product lands in Stacy's lap one day that's the \"finished\" thing, and Stacy starts using it for day-to-day work before hitting that edge case that didn't come up before because, surprise, management was too impatient to begin \"agile\" development, and didn't allocate any development effort to proper requirements gathering either.\n\nAnd I'd love to blame management at this level. Often they are at fault. But more often than not, there's someone above that boss demanding to *see* progress, so all the invisible steps that happen before visible development work get rushed or skipped or otherwise pushed aside to appease someone who is trying to make sure that their boss doesn't get in trouble with investors for not meeting velocity goals that were set with the express purpose of quarterly growth at all costs.\n\nThen we zoom all the way back in to Stacy who has an angry boss for forgetting feature Y, and an angry development team for what, to them, is scope creep. \n\nStacy in accounting usually gets screwed over in these scenarios just as bad as the devs do. \n\nThe truest blame almost always lies with someone further up the chain.",

Software makes a bunch of vague promises about what their platform/new feature can do.\n\n**Step 2**: Owner comes back from conference excited, insisting that we need to start implementing this new feature, it will save a ton of time/money, etc.\n\n**Step 3:** If some poor soul asks for the nitty gritty details of how this feature actually works, how it will work with our current procedures, etc, the owner will either brush them off as a \"we'll figure it out as we deal with it\" or attack them for being reluctant to change.\n\n**Step 4**: Owner instructs someone in middle management to implement said feature. Usually a mildly involved office manager. Office manager spends a month with customer support of the new software, works out the billing kinks, and is the one who gets a basic tutorial of how the thing works.\n\n**Step 5:** Feature is implemented. Owner suspiciously goes on vacation the day before. Office manager hands the new software to general staff with, at best, a tutorial video that only explains the basics.\n\n**Step 6**: Once general staff starts using the feature, it doesn't do everything it was promised. Not only that, it doesn't interface with any of our current procedures, so workarounds are developed to fit a square puzzle piece in a circular hole, meaning this \"helpful\" new feature actually takes more time than the old way of doing it.\n\n**Step 7:** Owner finds out that general staff are taking too long, making errors, etc. Owner initially gets angry at staff, then gets angry at middle management. Claims it's a training issue and that we'll just need to deal with it. He might instruct the office manager to reach out to customer support.\n\n**Step 8**: Customer support reaches out to specialized technicians. Turns out, the feature can only do xyz in a very specific way that does not work for what we do. We would need to change how employees' pay plans work to accommodate it, etc. These are changes the owner is not willing to agree with.\n\n**Final Result**: Software technicians are baffled at the questions we're asking and features we're asking for, because it has nothing to do with what they were told to design. Software's marketing team continues to use target words they don't understand to draw customers in. Owners refuse to admit they are wrong, or refuse to invest the time to revert back to previous methods. General staff is left finding workarounds that occasionally don't work, angering customers/employees. Middle management is stuck in the middle of it all, frustrated that they're getting the blame for it on both sides.",

Yes, its better to use a real database, but sometimes its not practical to start one up, you don't want to get your company's IT involved, or other people don't have the know-how to deal with them easily.",

What data?\n\nAll data for all clients for the last 3 years, run on demand.\n\nSo... The product team wants us to export our entire, multiterrabyte database, in Excel, on demand, for a client?\n\nYes\n\nDo they understand that that isn't possible?  Like even technically feasible?  You can't have a multi terrabyte excel.  \n\nWe can't?\n\nNo.\n\nHow large can an Excel be?\n\nI don't know.  But even if it was several gigabytes, each report would have thousand files for each export.\n\nOkay, let's do that.\n\nWtf?  No.  We have an API, let them just use that.\n\nAn API?  Let me see.  No, I just checked with sales, when they made the deal, the other team was extremely insistent on excel, and that was what was written into the deal.\n\nWtf?  First, who the hell allowed that deal.  Secondly, what idiot was he talking to?\n\nHe was talking to a sales rep at COMPANY X, but now we're contractually obligated, so development needs to begin yesterday \n\n\n\nNote: this was a real fucking conversation at my company.",

I had a neighbor was a COBOL programmer who retired in 1995, then continued to work freelance until the mid 2010s when he really did retire. While fewer and fewer COBOL systems exist by the year there are even fewer people who are capable of maintaining them. If you have experience with it you can pretty much write your own ticket.",

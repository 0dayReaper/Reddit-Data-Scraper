I kept reasoning with myself that he\u2019ll just find someone else to do it if I don\u2019t. I ended up doing it and there\u2019s no way that dude passed.",

Knowing he couldn't, he was soliciting strangers for a pee sample that would pass the test. Op is implying that they also would not have passed the drug test, but provided the pee and got a cool $100 out of it. \n\nGood deal for op, bad deal for parking garage pee cup man",

Suppliers are drawn to the opportunity, bringing in more foot traffic, generating a positive feedback loop and eventually consolidating into a de facto free market economy.",

There are people who have no desire for sex or go there whole lives without sex and they don't turn into predators.\n\nSome people are just fucked up and use whatever authority is at their disposal to abuse others.

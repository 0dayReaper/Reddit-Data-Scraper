Basically the concept is humans live with intelligent dinosaurs, and all sorts of cool stuff happens with that! They went super in depth with it, and made a whole writing system that would be easy for dinos to do with their claws, and more stuff like that. There\u2019s also power crystals and giant steampunk Dino mechs, and other wacky stuff like that, but it\u2019s all in context and not just random or included to be cool. Once you understand how the world works, they tell stories of characters and their Dino companions, and all the conflict that occurs in this world. You should try to buy one of the books, you\u2019ll be hooked!",

However, I think if a major studio made this it would be adapted as a dino police procedural that's basically Law and Order: Cretaceous Victims Unit. For fucks sake Fox took Lucifer, a moody tale of the King of Hell dealing with \"family drama\" and the ennui of immortality and turned it into a buddy cop procedural where Lucifer helps a pouty blond cop solve crimes. I mean it was ridiculous fun in it's own way, but Lucifer definitely got run through the Hollywood Hack Mill. I can't think Dinotopia would fare much better. Hey, maybe we'll luck out and the  BBC will option it and it won't suck.\n\n*grammar",

            "comment": "You should know: Microdosing isn't real.  \n\nOh it's definitely correlated with perceived increases in mood and anxiety.  It's just that so is giving the same person absolutely nothing at all.  Placebo is massively effective at treating depression and anxiety, and microdosing doesn't outperform it:\n\n&gt;Ample anecdotal evidence suggests that microdosing can improve mood, well-being, creativity, and cognition [17, 28], and recent uncontrolled, open-label observational studies have provided some empirical support for these claims [7,8,9, 18,19,20, 27,28,29]. While encouraging, these studies are vulnerable to experimental biases, including confirmation bias and placebo effects [56]. This is especially problematic in the case of microdosing, since users make up a self-selected sample with optimistic expectations about the outcome of the practice [4, 57]. This positivity bias, combined with the low doses and self-assessment of the drug effects via scales and questionnaires, paves the way for a strong placebo response.\n\n&gt;According to our results, **0.5 g of dried mushroom material did not present significantly positive impact on creativity (divergent and convergent thinking), cognition, physical activity levels, and self-reported measures of mental health and well-being.**\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-022-02039-0\n\n&gt;However, when looking at the between-group comparisons of the same outcomes, no significant differences were found between the placebo and microdose groups. On the cognitive tests, which are less subjective than the self-reported psychological outcomes, the microdose group did not even improve from baseline to week 5 and the between-groups comparisons were not significant either. Thus, our study validates the positive anecdotal reports about the psychological benefits of microdosing (significant improvements from baseline in a broad range of psychological measures); however, **our results also suggest that these improvements are not due to the pharmacological action of microdosing, but are rather explained by the placebo effect** (lack of significant between-groups differences).\n\nhttps://elifesciences.org/articles/62878\n\n&gt; We conclude that within the context of a controlled setting and a limited number of administrations, repeated low doses of LSD are safe, but produce **negligible changes in mood or cognition in healthy volunteers**.\n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/adb.13143\n\n&gt;Our confirmatory analyses revealed that **psilocybin microdosing did not affect emotion processing or symptoms of anxiety and depression compared with placebo**. Our exploratory analyses revealed that psilocybin microdosing did not affect self-reported interoceptive awareness, that symptoms of depression and stress were significantly reduced in the first block compared with baseline, that participants broke blind in the second block and that there was no effect of expectations. Further research in a substance-na\u00efve population with clinical range anxiety and depressive symptoms is needed to substantiate the potential beneficial effects of microdosing.\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/02698811211050556\n\nThat's not to say the science on ACTUAL, significant doses isn't real.  Those produce clinically significant benefits when compared to placebo that last for months.  But the concept of taking a dose \"too small to perceive\" having any neurological benefit at all does appear to be a myth.",

I have long hair, kinda unkempt, and a goatee. I saw a full on caveman staring back at me. Staring amazed re at me, and my surroundings through this mirror portal. The look on his face was god fearing amazement. Afterwards, i raced a train, howling at the moon. I showed up at my girls window, and freaked her out. Described later as a bushman with twigs and leaves in the hair. She knew it was me, but took two days of me telling my caveman story before she would see me in person. I ended the day in the bath. Feeling clean and cozy, as i feel asleep with my nose below the water line. I woke, and jumped out of that bath after a slap to the face. None of my roommates were home, but the next day, i still had 5 fingers across my face for everyone to see. Thankful for guardians.",

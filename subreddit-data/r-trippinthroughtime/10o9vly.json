            "comment": "\"Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening\" is a surrealist painting by Salvador Dal\u00ed. A shorter alternate title for the painting is \"Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee.\" It was painted in 1944, and the woman in the painting, dreaming, is said to represent his wife, Gala. The painting is currently in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, in Madrid.\n\nIt is an oil painting on wood. In this \"hand-painted dream photograph\", as Dal\u00ed generally called his paintings, there is a seascape of distant horizons and calm waters, perhaps Port Lligat, amidst which Gala is the subject of the scene. Next to the naked body of the sleeping woman, which levitates above a flat rock that floats above the sea, Dal\u00ed depicts two suspended droplets of water and a pomegranate, a Christian symbol of fertility and resurrection. Above the pomegranate flies a bee, an insect that traditionally symbolizes the Virgin.\n\nIn the upper left of the painting what seems to be a yelloweye rockfish bursts out of the pomegranate, and in turn spews out a pouncing tiger that then spews out another pouncing tiger about to attack Gala and a rifle with a bayonet that is about to sting her in the arm. Above them is Dal\u00ed's first use of an elephant with long flamingo legs, found in his later compositions such as The Temptation of St. Anthony. The elephant carries on its back an obelisk, inspired by Bernini's Elephant and Obelisk in Rome's Piazza Santa Maria sopra Minerva.\n\n\\-\n\nI added the whale and the bowl of petunias to make the joke from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.",

Bayonets are weapons of war; who would use a single-shot shotgun as a weapon of war, except insurgents making their own shotguns? Slam fire shotguns are a thing; I feel like I could build one myself at Home Depot without leaving the store, and I've never built a gun. I could see putting a bayonet on one of those, but it would probably be pretty rough looking. This is, like, a simple hunting shotgun, like for birds or rabbit or squirrel.\n\nWeird",

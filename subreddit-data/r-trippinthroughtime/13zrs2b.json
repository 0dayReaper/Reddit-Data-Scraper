I've decided I will badge in, get my free fruit and coffee, go to the onsite gym, drive home, take my bra off, and work from my desk.",

You don\u2019t get any connection to your team, no real Networking can take place, there is no community. It\u2019s what I experienced in my past jobs even when from a Pc. too many meetings (because before you needed to be on location for one) while at the same time stuff goes far slower because you do not have the physical proximity, and instead get told \u201ewe can talk about that in 5 days earliest\u201c after waiting 2 days for an answer over teams. Another thing I\u2019ve noticed is longer working days. Because you\u2019re at home there is no problem on working longer or you don\u2019t really notice it (same with often skipping lunch breaks).\n\nIt\u2019s certainly a big improvement for people which worked for decades on location already, more family time and stuff, but it also takes away the few personal connections you can form and that come in Hand all throughout your career. \n\n\nNot to mention (that\u2019s a more personal thing) that some people simply need the clear distinction between office and home. Splitting it is important for mental health. Work is work, play is play. Doing both in the same room gets you into depression fast.\n\n\nOverall it\u2019s obviously different strokes for different folks, and I\u2019m glad so many companies now give the option, but having the chance to be on location (with everyone else) is certainly not without its perks.",

If I do not know my teammembers except through the screen that\u2019s a lot harder to get. Also knowing relevant people and having contacts in your field helps by broadening your horizon, especially to prevent abuse from the employer. It is easier to be cut off when you have no ideas about the people at the company. And it\u2019s simply unchangable human nature that you need to sozialize and be able to get to know and work with plenty of different people personally to cement yourself into the industry. Having people to rely on in various cases is never wrong. \n\n\n&gt;\tMentoring should be available for everyone and easily done via remote\n\nYes, I agree.\n\n&gt;\tOffice culture is just shorthand for toxicity and game playing and should be minimized as much as possible.\n\nMaybe it is just a generational difference, or differences between countries, but on my previous job it was very toxic (consulting) and 100% remote. I don\u2019t know exactly what you mean with game playing.\n\nMind you, all my jobs had 100% remote option, and I am glad that corona brought this huge shift, but I noticed I simply work a lot better when I am on location. \n\nMentally you are in work mode, You have the (in my experience, I was probably lucky) excellent office spaces, with lots of nice amenities and design. Something beating my room at home at least.\n\nBut as the biggest contributor I simply  am more effective when I have others around me also being productive. There is just something about collective productivity that gets me easier into \u201ethe flow\u201c.\n\n\nOverall I am not want to bring back mandatory on-location, because there are a lot of different cases, but I just wanted to show that it\u2019s more nuanced then that.",

I enjoy working at home a few times a week, I get to do some chores, take a long lunch, and quit early without anyone noticing. I hardly feel like that qualifies as siding with capital. \n\nThat said, it is interesting that you mention self discipline - surely the beneficiaries of any increased productivity, whether that's you getting it at home or me getting it at the office, are the capitalists anyway. So it's interesting that it sounds like you value productivity and discipline while also accusing me of siding against the workers. In fairness, late stage capitalism is a hell of a confusing time to navigate, so I support you regardless where you prefer to work.\n\nAnyway, you clearly have good taste in subreddits, hope you enjoy the art history memes.",

It\u2019s pretty basic, cases received, cases completed, accounting for hours worked.\n\nIt\u2019s a large multinational corp. they\u2019ve been trying to get people back in for the past year at least. They used the May 11 date determined by the government to be the end of the pandemic as their hard \u201cback to work\u201d date.\n\nOn top of this, making things much more cut and dry, we access patient PHI on every case we work. The accrediting agencies that monitor lab facilities require each location that access PHI to be certified. So for us to work from home, all of our homes would have to be certified by the agencies. For Covid they put out a waiver not requiring this, to support WFH situations.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve found however, is that there are labs that are WFH 100% of the time regardless of the pandemic, though I\u2019m not sure how those work.\n\nThis is all possible because I work in a lab that is \u201cdry\u201d, we just do analysis from work stations.",

How can being on training zoom calls help anybody especially tenured people who already know what their doing\u2026makes no sense to me\u2026.this sounds like to me people who don\u2019t like to work take these remote jobs, sorry to say",

Those of us who have watched it will confirm it has a much wider appeal. In fact, some might say it's not even wholly appropriate for kids, given some of the darker and uncomfortable subject matter that it (very adeptly) deals with. The concern the execs have is that the themes of the show won't appeal to kids. And personally I don't blame them. I'm in my 20's and Atticus' \"accident\" was very upsetting for me to watch, and the show doesn't shy away from moments like that in seasons 2 and 3. It embraces those moments. So the problem isn't that the show isn't good. The problem is that the show might be too good. For the most part western perception of animation is that it needs to be silly to appeal to kids or raunchy to appeal to adults. There's unfortunately not a huge market for thought-provoking, emotionally sensitive animation. To prove the execs wrong we need to tell everyone we know to stream Infinity Train on HBO max so we can see what's in store for the next 5 seasons",

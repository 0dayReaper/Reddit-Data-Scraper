The same could certainly be done for any society, including the one you live in today.\n\nThe truth is that human beings are always human beings. There have been no more, or less, evil humans in the past than in the present. We are capable of great good and great evil and every human society is a showcase of both. The western world today still relies on slave labor, whether domestically in America's prison system, or at a cowardly remove, like the blind eye that Europe and the United States too often turn toward the amoral labor they outsource to the developing world.\n\nAnd regarding blood sport? Every time the reddit mob cries out that they hope for the death penalty for an accused (often not yet even convicted) murderer or sexually violent abuser, they are baying for blood. It does not matter whose blood it is - two wrongs don't make a right. Human beings want blood. If you would have it be wrong then, you would have it be wrong, period. The colosseum was a theater for executing criminals. We still have that today.\n\nBy participating in modern society, by purchasing or even just using the phone or computer you used to make that post, you are complicit in this system too. So am I.\n\nThe same was true of the Romans. The same is true of everyone living in a post-agricultural society. So maybe ease up on the blanket judgments. Human beings today are not saints. We've just gotten better at turning a blind eye.\n\n&gt;It's never said by people who both have decent standards of their own and a well educated view of the culture in question.\n\nI have seen it said many times on /r/AskHistorians, by people with it impeccable standards and PhDs in the histories of the cultures they are discussing. If you're going to allow anecdotal exposure to inform your perspective, maybe you should stop looking at the garbage parts of reddit.",

They're going to talk about how cops could kill anyone they wanted, and they'd just get reassigned to other districts. They're going to talk about how slavery is illegal, except if you're incarcerated - and how we have private prisons and basically a slave industry in that respect, with some of the highest incarceration rate in the world, where they aren't rehabilitated but likely end up going back.\n\nThey're going to wonder why we weren't rioting to change things today. They're going to wonder how terrible we were to allow these things to exist, how we didn't vote for change. They're going to blame us just as much as we blame the Romans for their cruelty and slavery.\n\nMy point is, take a look around and think about how many mistakes humanity makes, and how few individuals support this, but it continues to exist. That's how I look at Rome. I'm sure there were plenty of people who saw cruelty and despised it and talked about how bad it was, but at the end of the day it takes a revolution for that to change, and a few powerful people with military backing to keep the system of exploitation alive. Those might've been senators and centurions back then, and now similarly it's senators and militarized police forces. We make similar mistakes, even if we \"know better\". But in the future, they're going to talk just as much shit about the US as we do Rome.",

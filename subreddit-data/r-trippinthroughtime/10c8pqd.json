I told my mom once that the nurse was acting like the bad kids who do drugs in DARE assemblies, peer pressure, lol.\n\nThe real tell about who was pushing the pushers was that the one opiate that I can take very very occasionally when it gets real bad is Ultram, which is made by a European company. The generic analogue to that which is made by an American company,  Tramydol, contains something that causes an allergic reaction when I take it. Doctors treat me like a drug seeker for asking for Ultram, not Tramadol,  not Percocet,  not Vicodin,  not Oxy...all of which were pushed on me despite my medical history. \n\nAnd now they're doing it with fentanyl. Pharmaceutical companies are straight up evil, responsible for so much death and destruction. But doctors and nurses need to get vigilant about it now that we know what they are capable of (and don't seem interested in making them face real consequences).",

I actually talked to the head pharmacist at my Walgreen's to suss it out since doctors, PAs and nurses were unhelpful to hostile.\n\n I moved pretty far away from him, but I still make an appointment with him (through the app, pretty easy) whenever I have a new medication.  I'd super recommend that since they know gads more about specific ingredients that go into medication that can cause reactions, drug interactions, side effects,  etc.\n\n For me, there were 2 things that made the Tramadol give me a bad reaction: my immune system is overactive from endometrial cancer,  so I get a pseudo allergic reaction to things like onions and grapefruit, and onion skins are apparently used in the coating for certain medicines (flipping weird); the other was that Ultram has an ingredient not found in Tramadol that simulates a lipid layer (I think that's what he said,  I have it written down in one of my notebooks) that helps opiates to not strip my neuroganglia, which is a problem for redheads and people who have had opiate addictions in the past and can cause bad reactions as a result.",

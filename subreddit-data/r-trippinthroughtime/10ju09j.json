I do that and don\u2019t even ask, I just say goodnight to which she replies \u201cyeah you\u2019re done but let me look at everything first\u201d which she doesn\u2019t do for almost another while I\u2019m just standing there. She finally lets me off and, after completely missing my ride home, I walk for two hours straight in heavy fog. To make matters worse, she loudly (not very but enough for me to hear clearly) that I should\u2019ve been doing this stuff before hand when we were slow (which was for about 5 minutes at a time, not enough to do any of the things assigned). It absolutely pissed me off but I got over it and slipped into a conversation with the general manager later, who respected that I did it, but was pissed that the other managers (who I didn\u2019t know at all btw) not only made me take out all of the trash myself because she and her friends want to, but made me stay almost 3 full hours later than I was supposed to without giving me a break at all throughout the day which completely messed up her hours. Anyways, I saw next weeks schedule and now that I learned her name, the worst manager of that night is only working one day next week!",

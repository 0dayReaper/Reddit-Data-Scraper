[7] And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne. [8] And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. [9] And they sang a new song, saying, \n\n    \u201cWorthy are you to take the scroll\n        and to open its seals,\n    for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God\n        from every tribe and language and people and nation, \n    [10] and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God,\n        and they shall reign on the earth.\u201d\n\nWhy Van Eyck didn\u2019t add more horns and eyes is beyond me.

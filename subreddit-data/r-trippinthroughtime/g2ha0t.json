He decided he would quietly divorce her and leave her in a far away town so she wouldn't be stoned and could be free to start anew. Decent guy, I know. But then the angel told Joseph that her conception was immaculate, and he shouldn't let her pregnancy get in the way of marrying her, so he did, and Joseph did consummate the marriage after Jesus was born, because Jesus had siblings.\n\nNow, that's what the Bible says. I personally believe it's a bunch of bologna, probably based on a somewhat true story of a guy named Jesus who was a halfway decent person and people murdered him for that. Then the details got fanciful when the story was recounted.",

John uses the word \u201cparthenos\u201d to describe Mary, a word which translates best to \u201cmaiden\u201d, or less idiomatically \u201cwoman of marriageable age\u201d. Although most marriageable women would happen to have been virgins in accordance with the social norms of the time, the explicit connotation of chastity or virginity is altogether absent from all canonical biblical accounts.",

Mary would thus serve the Lord at the Temple, as women had for centuries (1 Sam. 2:22), and as Anna the prophetess did at the time of Jesus\u2019 birth (Luke 2:36\u201337). A life of continual, devoted service to the Lord at the Temple meant that Mary would not be able to live the ordinary life of a child-rearing mother. Rather, she was vowed to a life of perpetual virginity.\n\n&gt;However, due to considerations of ceremonial cleanliness, it was eventually necessary for Mary, a consecrated \u201cvirgin of the Lord,\u201d to have a guardian or protector who would respect her vow of virginity. Thus, according to the\u00a0Protoevangelium, Joseph, an elderly widower who already had children, was chosen to be her spouse. (This would also explain why Joseph was apparently dead by the time of Jesus\u2019 adult ministry, since he does not appear during it in the gospels, and since Mary is entrusted to John, rather than to her husband Joseph, at the crucifixion).\n\n[Source](https://www.catholic.com/tract/mary-ever-virgin)",

I think the only contenders are Matthew 1:25 and Luke 1:34, both of which use the verb, \u201cgignosko\u201d, \u201cI know\u201d.\n\nBiblical use of the Greek \u201cgignosko\u201d, \u201cto know\u201d, is also questionable and ambiguous at best. Unless the authors were prudes (well, they probably were), they could have been much more deliberate in choosing a word that means \u201cto have sex\u201d, as 99% of the time outside of the bible \u201cgignosko\u201d has no sexual connotation whatsoever. It simply means to know, recognize, perceive, etc.\n\nAnyone who translates, e.g., Luke 1:35 to read: \u201c\u2018How will this be,\u2019 Mary asked the angel, \u2018since I am a virgin?\u2019\u201d is a charlatan. One must do great violence to the authenticity of the Greek text to swap out a verb with a \u201cverb of being-predicate noun structure\u201d. But then again, we are talking about a highly organized group of ideologues that also want to translate Luke 17:21 as \u201cthe kingdom of god is IN YOUR MIDST\u201d (actual reading: WITHIN YOU). God forbid you lend any credence to a gnostic or mystical interpretation of the bible.",

They simply mandated their wives be chaste to ensure that the children begotten thereof would be their own. Monogamy was a Roman kink, and became a Christian one almost exclusively because Christianity grew up under the Roman Empire.",

You'd think if Jesus were going around telling people he was the son of a virgin, that would be something you'd mention if you were writing about it. The story appears to have been added by the other two gospel writers in order to fulfill a mistranslation of a prophecy of the Hebrew Bible, which translated \"young woman\" into \"virgin\" when going from the original Hebrew to Greek. The writers of these gospels only spoke Greek, and therefore didn't understand the original Hebrew meaning. \n\nThe early followers of Jesus probably weren't aware of this virgin nonsense.",

She would secretly listen to a diskman to enjoy modern music...her only pleasure. She had zero awareness of how sex or intercourse works. When she gets pregnant...she jumps to the conclusion that it was the music that had made her pregnant, because the music was the only thing that had given her any peace, pleasure, or joy.\n\nI could definitely see some poor uneducated devout young women thinking it was god who made her pregnant when her faith might've been the only joy in her life",

I know people assume people in the past were very strict on sex, which they were about half the periods but being completely ignorant of sex is something that can only really be achieved with the levels of control that a parent can have over the interaction of their children. I have been to a few actually rural Christian Communities and what I say above apply to all.",

This divine nature, itself is God, (typically referred to as the Son). In many declarations of faith, the example I'll use is the Nicean Creed, states that the Son is begotten and consubstantial with God. As such Jesus's divine nature has always existed alongside God the Father, that being that Jesus has always existed. Now the explanation for why Jesus hasn't just always been around, or why God would allow for original sin, etc, there are far better theologians and religious studies academics that can explain it better than I can (I'm actually not a practicing Catholic, I just enjoy reading religous studies articles in my free time).",

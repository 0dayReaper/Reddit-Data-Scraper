You remember anthrax where they were killing political and popular figures for not going along with the war by sending anthrax to their houses in packages addressed to them and blaming it on terrorists.  That was literally the CIA.  Everyone acknowledges it.  Fauci was caught funding gain of function on specifically the corona virus.  And the director of US bioweapons facilities in Ukraine admitted to their activities before congress last year.  It's on the congressional record.  You can watch her do it on youtube.  Is cspan fake news now?",

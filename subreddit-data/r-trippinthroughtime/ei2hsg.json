If the individual does not cultivate an appreciation of time, and a fear of it, then he will keep growing complacent with his life and nothing will change. Nothing, as much as we would like that to be the case, is instant, or near instantaneous. Especially health: something as important as this is a long term engagement with the self: mind, body and soul all intertwined together. If there is no continual development of those three pillars of what makes a human what he is, then there is a high probability that the end result after some time will not be desirable to anyone, but those who grew complacent within their own lives and wish to stay miserable amongst others of their kind. Because they have no will left, because they only care about a hope that they lost long ago.\n\nSo, appreciate time as it passes and as it passed, and perhaps fear time that will pass by. It goes by faster than we realize, even if we think we do. I never did. I never will. Growing in age makes you realize than not a day will be the same as another. Never anymore these days, anyway. Happy new year, everyone, and may you all be well.",

Wake up more or less the same time every day. \n\n* make sure you're getting your nutrients! Especially vitamin D right now during the winter. I take these multivitamin pills every day. We're adviced to have *atleast* 5 servings (1 serving ~ 80 - 100g) of fruit and veggies every day. \n\n* Shower in the morning to wake yourself up. (I can't function without this)\n\n* Take a walk in the morning before you start any work. It feels really good. \n\n* Try to not work in your bedroom. That is where you relax. (Your brain will be trained to know this)\n\nAfter the day is finished and you have done what you need to do. Just know that in the evening you can do *WHATEVER YOU WANT!* That is your reward for doing your best that day. \n\nPS. Small tip, I like to put on either YouTube, Netflix or some music at the end of the day when I'm doing the dishes. Makes it a lot more fun. (Doing the dishes in the evening is important imo. Gives you a clean slate the next day.) Oh and exercise is good too. \n\nI don't always manage to do to all this but when I do it feels good.\n\nIf you do this for a while and it doesn't work, maybe consider talking to a specialist about it?",

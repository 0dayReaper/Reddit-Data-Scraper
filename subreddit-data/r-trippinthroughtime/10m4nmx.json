Just don't single me out directly during or in that process.  I won't post the info unless I see someone ask and it goes unsanswered by someone else.\n\nI think the best way to engage is to focus on the things you like versus what you don't like. And to be kind and respectful in your matter of opinions or comments.   It's the only way we can live and let live otherwise there will always be faults we can find in one another.  And some people will be angry just to be angry.  Every comment you'd leave me, seemed more angry than the last.  Especially the past few days - to the point of wanting to block you. And I noticed it was my posts as you don't regularly participate in that type of behavior.  I actually really enjoy it when someone is keen to knowing where the artwork comes from. I'm a huge art buff by nature but even I don't or pretend to know it all.\n\n\nThere is a place for all of us here.  If you don't find the content useful for whatever reason, that's okay.  There's a place for everyone here.   We coexist.\n\nI wish there was a historical reference to memes, but not all of us are on everyday to genuinely know what's been posted however even if there was - reddit itself is 95% reposted/regurgitated content.  Mods are here for a reason. They don't like it, they will issue warnings and then remove the post.  \n\nSome communities are extra vigilant on what confines as reposting. But to me reposting is posting something thats been posted recently.  E.g. see a 100K post and post it again the next day.  While others have strict rules that posting on their sub is to be ONLY original content and reposting anything thats been posted before I'd not right. While as some subs rules specify that the mods may even allow reposting under discretion. \n\nThe community isn't built on divide, it's built on common interest and bringing everyone and even new people to the table.  And even the table has legs. It's not built by singling anybody out.  \n\n I do see you comment on most of my posts - which is no problem.  And I honestly chose not to engage. But it's not cool, when it seems your focus is centered or narrowed to one person specific like that on more than one their posts.\n\nI hope we can just shake hands on this and be on our way.  As Im not intending to be defensive or want to be offensive towards you in any way. \ud83e\udd1d\n\nI'm not new to artwork.  But I am relatively new to memes.  Even when they were created , just wasn't a fan or even \"got them\" until rather recently.  My fossil records on memes are relatively new and that's because art picks up new enthusiasts from all walks and ages of Life, everyday.",

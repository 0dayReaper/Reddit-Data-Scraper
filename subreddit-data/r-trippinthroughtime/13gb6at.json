Indeed the world, no the universe; is a terrifying reality to behold let alone exisit in, no wonder then how good it was to be, and yet be without such ghastly knowledge. To know only warmth, affection, and the closeness of which only the womb &amp; mother can impart. This fundamental desire colors almost all aspects of life as we seek comfort ourselves in different ways; sex &amp; bdsm, weighted blankets, swaddling &amp; cuddling, the construction of domiciles, the very means of containing things within other things &amp; compartmentalization. This is one of those memes that's so deep it pierces the mental veils we erect to protect our fragile egos and it reminds us of the futility of our efforts. We will never experience that place again for we are doomed to roam the earth and die. What is there to say of such a fate? Nothing, just upvote.",

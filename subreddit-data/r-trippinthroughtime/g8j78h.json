For comparison, homo sapiens is capable of a load of around 1 to 5 ml.\n\nUpper limit for equines is around 250 to 400 ml. So if you're lucky, you get about a coke can's worth of clip clop jizz.

Assuming one was maximising the shot from their meat cannon, we can find the maximum distance their goo gun can shoot by first splitting the bird shot's velocity into its vector components. If they want to maximize horizontal distance, their gravy cannon is probably going to firing from a 45 degree angle from the shooter (assuming little air r\u00e9sistance). This is also nice, since it splits their penis projectiles velocity among vectors that are equal. We can use this equation to find the components:\n\nv^horizontal = v^vertical = v * cos(45)\n\n Thus, the horizontal velocity is 8.84 m/s and the vertical velocity is 8.84 m/s. Using the vertical velocity, we can find the time it takes for the first drop to reach the top of the arch, with this equation:\n\nt = (v^final - v^initial) /a\n\nWhere v means velocity, a means acceleration, and t means time. Final velocity is 0. If this isn't obvious, picture that perfect money shot flying through the air, as it goes up, gravity will pull this baby gravy down and slow it down. Well, at some point, to slow down enough to start returning to Earth, its velocity must equal 0 at some point during the trip. The initial velocity is the vertical component, 8.84 m/s. Acceleration is gravity, -9.81 m/s. Plugging these in, we get:\n\n0 = 8.84/9.81\nt = 0.901\n\nNow, we have the time is takes for our yogurt squirt to reach the top of the arch. Using this equation:\n\nh = v^initial * t + .5 * a * t^2\n\nWhere h is the height traveled and everything else is the same, we can find the height from the top of the curve from the tip of our trouser snake. Now, by plugging in what we know:\n\nh = 8.84 * .901 + .5 * 9.81 * .901^2\n\nh = 8.00 + 3.98\n\nh = 11.9 m\n\nNow, the height of a human body is split just about 50/50, with variations either direction. This means that given the average height of a human male, in meters, is 1.76, we can simply add halve of this number 11.9, and get the total height from the tip of the rainbow to the splat at the bottom. This gives a total height of a whopping 12.8 meters! We're not done yet, using the same equation, we can find how long it takes for the squirt to go through the full shot by solving for t:\n\nt = sqrt(2 * (h - v^initial * t) /a)\n\nWhere the initial velocity is 0. Plugging in what we know, and we get:\n\nt = sqrt(2 * (12.8 - 0)/9.81))\nt = sqrt(25.6/9.81)\nt = sqrt(2.64)\n\nt = 1.62\n\nGreat! We have the time is took for our kids to go to the moon and back. Multiplying this with our horizontal velocity, like so:\n\n8.84*1.62 = 14.3 m, or 46.91 feet. \n\nWhich gives us the maximum distance our gravy maker can fire to, given ideal conditions. So, in short, yeah, I imagine a horse can shoot his goo six feet. How to get the angle right, though...\n\nEdit: some corrections,  there is a cos(45) coefficient on the vector components, making v^horizontal = v^vertical = 8.84 m/s. Secondly, we have to halve the 1.76 m, since that is the average height of a male and we need pelvis height.\n\nEdit Credit to u/carwhyleinads",

Buber] 25:1), but the Holy One, blessed be He, who knows man\u2019s thoughts, judges them by their thoughts and not their deed. The daughters\u2019 true intent was not to lie with their father, on whom they had no sexual designs, but to save the world from total devastation. The daughters thought that the entire world had been laid waste, as had happened during the Flood, since they saw no living souls wherever they went; they did not know that only Sodom had been destroyed. They said: \u201cThe Holy One, blessed be He, has rescued us so that the world will exist through us, so that the human race shall continue.\u201d\n\nhttps://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/lots-daughters-midrash-and-aggadah",

He and his two daughters lived in a cave. 31 One day the older daughter said to the younger, \u201cOur father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children\u2014as is the custom all over the earth. 32 Let\u2019s get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father.\u201d\n\n&gt;33 That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.\n\n&gt;34 The next day the older daughter said to the younger, \u201cLast night I slept with my father. Let\u2019s get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.\u201d 35 So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.\n\n&gt;36 So both of Lot\u2019s daughters became pregnant by their father. 37 The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab[g]; he is the father of the Moabites of today. 38 The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi[h]; he is the father of the Ammonites[i] of today.\n\nPretty spicy stuff.",

When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. 2\u00a0\u201cMy lords,\u201d he said, \u201cplease turn aside to your servant\u2019s house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d they answered, \u201cwe will spend the night in the square.\u201d\n\n3\u00a0But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate. 4\u00a0Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom\u2014both young and old\u2014surrounded the house. 5\u00a0They called to Lot, \u201cWhere are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.\u201d\n\n6\u00a0Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him 7\u00a0and said, \u201cNo, my friends. Don\u2019t do this wicked thing. 8\u00a0Look,  I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them  out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don\u2019t do  anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my  roof.\u201d  \n\n\nGenesis 19:1-8",

Just like every other person in this thread...\u201dback it up with bible verse\u201d - do \u201cChristian\u201d Christians cherry pick verses? Absolutely. But you and everyone else in this thread did the exact same thing. Ascribing the clear sins of people in the Bible as God\u2019s - obviously not having read any of it. The Old Testament is RIDDLED with the people sinning, it\u2019s descriptive of their shortcomings and failures, not prescriptive of what God condones or encourages. \n\nAnd how could you possibly believe there isn\u2019t a cohesive message? The books of the Bible itself are PAINFULLY intertwined with each other. Full of prophesy, all telling one cohesive story. I\u2019m so sick of this ashiest hive mind on reddit. Yes there are bad Christians who back up poor theology with cherry picked Bible verses. But that doesn\u2019t automatically discredit. If idiot Christians can discredit Christianity in your mind then all the idiot atheists should also be able to discredit atheism. That logic doesn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nBad Christians taint the name of Christianity and God. At least some atheists have taken the time to search out for themselves and still choose to be atheist. It still hurts me that they don\u2019t believe, but at least they actually spent the time to look into it themselves - to that end I can understand. What I can\u2019t understand are non believers who spout off about Christianity like they know anything about it while clearly never having spent time to learn anything about it....no coherent story...come on. \u201cBad atheists\u201d, \u201cgood atheists\u201d, and \u201cbad Christians\u201d...they all hurt true Christianity. It\u2019s a shame \u201cgood Christians\u201d are in such short supply. I\u2019m just so sick of reading all these regurgitated opinions of Christianity and the Bible from people who clearly just chose to take offense based on misrepresentation from bad Christians and other atheists.",

They sentenced him to death and recalled him to be executed. He, of course bailed, sabotaged the expedition, leading to a disastrous loss for Athens, and then went to the Spartans and advised them against Athens.",

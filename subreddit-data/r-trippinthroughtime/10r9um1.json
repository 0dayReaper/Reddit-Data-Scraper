Those cars are safe.\n\nOther cars let you lock the door before you get out. Then you can get out, shut the door, and be locked out. Those cars are idiotic.\n\nEven the \"safe\" cars can sometimes fool if you put your keys in the trunk and close it. Like if you change your pants at a rest stop and forget to move the keys from the old pocket to the new pocket.",

            "comment": "Oh man. So. Story time.\n\nI did this one time. I generally drive reliable old junkers, like Hondas, because of the way my life is sort of arranged. I parked in a parking lot on a day off going to a thrift store or something, and then I sat in my car for a minute listening to the end of a podcast or some other piece of audio and then I got out with the keys still in the ignition and as the locked door left my hand I realized what I was doing but it was too late to grab the door as it closed.\n\nSo I called AAA and then they told me that it was going to be like an hour or something, so I decided to go in and do my thrift store shopping and maybe hang out and read a little bit, and that's what I did. 45 minutes later I go back out to my car and set the bag of crap on my hood or the roof or whatever and just start thinking about the problem.\n\nThey make those little magnetic key things. I tried one of those once, years before, and it just disappeared, probably falling out on the road due to vibration, so I decided there was an easier or superior way to do it. I'd been thinking about this problem on and off for quite some time and I realized the thing to do was to take a piece of romex or maybe a wire hanger, thread it through a key, and then wrap it or tie it on a piece of the car, maybe the frame or some other part of the undercarriage so it would just be up in there out of the way.\n\nSo I go around to the front of the car and lay down on the asphalt underneath looking for a good place where the key will be out of the way of the engine and any moving parts, it won't get damaged, it won't get brushed up against speed bumps or something. There's no place to put it. I mean there are pieces of frame that I could have used, but they were way too fat and would have taken too much wire to go around. So I get up and go around to the back of the car.\n\nImmediately, I see the perfect place to put it. It's far away from the muffler so it won't be vibrating, it's nowhere near the towing hooks so I don't have to worry about that, it's not going to fall off, it's the perfect place to wrap a hunk of wire around.\n\nAnd of course wrapped around it is a hunk of wire threaded through a key",

I pulled up the the light and this guy pulls up next to me in the left lane and looks over at me, waves, and waits for the light. \n\nWe start moving and he comes all the way over into my lane. I had a shit car so I didn\u2019t back down and he had a freshly washed white Mercedes suv. I  just kept moving and he flew around me and then spit his mouthful of lemonheads out and they hit my passenger window. The lady in his passenger seat was laughing her ass off. \n\nI grabbed 3 Reese\u2019s eggs and shoved them in my mouth, chewed them like 20 times, opened the window, sped up, and chucked that big ass ball of chocolate and peanut butter through his open window, onto his shirt, and the lady a little. The side of the car was also covered. I sped away and dipped down a side street.\n\nI get home, lock my car, walk up, and realize I locked my keys in the trunk when I put them down to grab the thing in there. The only spare was with my friend a few states away. I had to call the cops to airbag my front door open so I could pop the trunk and get the keys. Took 3 hours. Instant karma lmao.",

                    "comment": "&gt;Thomas Hart Benton\u2019s \"Susanna and the Elders\" is derived from an Apocryphal biblical narrative in which two elders trap Susanna, a married woman, while she is bathing. When she refuses their sexual advances, they falsely accuse her of adultery. Susanna\u2019s life is spared only when the prophet Daniel obtains conflicting statements from her accusers, who are then sentenced to death. By depicting his subjects as contemporary Missourians (the figure with a mustache is a self-portrait of the artist), Benton transformed this story into a critique of what he perceived as the moral hypocrisy and repressed sexuality of Bible Belt religions.Although European old masters such as Rembrandt also depicted Susanna nude, Benton\u2019s version has pubic hair, a detail typically omitted both in American fine art and in popular culture, including contemporaneous pinup models. Benton\u2019s image challenges viewers to define the distinctions between fine art and popular art and between the nude and the naked.

In the early 2000s, there was an article in Parade magazine in The Kansas City Star on the painting itself (I still have my copy). The article was about the woman in the painting. She had passed away, and her son found the sketches of her as Persephone. The family had no idea she had posed for THB, being the depression and a time when posing nude for money could be viewed as shameful/sinful. \n\nThe woman lived down the street from where I grew up. I remember a particularly hot summer where her AC had gone out and was unable to help her, being only 9 at the time. The article had a picture of her house and where she was buried. I sometimes go to visit.",

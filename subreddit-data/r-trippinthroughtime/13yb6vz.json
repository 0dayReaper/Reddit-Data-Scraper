It\u2019s funny because on first look I wouldn\u2019t have thought of that, but OP framing the picture in that context makes me see it in a different way and it is amusing. If it was a literal picture of two people after sex it wouldn\u2019t be comical. Like making up stories about pictures when you were little.",

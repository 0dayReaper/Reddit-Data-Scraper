            "comment": "Kehinde Wiley, an African-American artist, strategically re-creates a French masterpiece from two hundred years before but with key differences. This act of appropriation reveals issues about the tradition of portraiture and all that it implies about power and privilege. Wiley asks us to think about the biases of the art historical canon (the set of works that are regarded as \u201cmasterpieces\u201d), representation in pop culture, and issues of race and gender. \n\nHere, Wiley replaces the original white subject\u2014the French general-turned-emperor Napoleon Bonaparte \u2014 with an anonymous black man whom Wiley approached on the street as part of his \u201cstreet-casting process.\u201d Although Wiley does occasionally create paintings on commission, he typically asks everyday people of color to sit for photographs, which he then transforms into paintings. Along the way, he talks with those sitters, gathering their thoughts about what they should wear, how they might pose, and which historical paintings to reference.\n\nRead more about this piece [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history-for-teachers/xeaa3470a:teaching-with-images/xeaa3470a:go-deeper-oppression-and-resistance/a/kehinde-wiley-napoleon-leading-the-army-over-the-alps)\n\nHere\u2019s an interesting tidbit: The background is also infused with tiny paintings of [sperm](https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/c37b28238c07c99007cbd7b140a9c7bd01993641.png)\u2014Wiley\u2019s way of poking fun at the highly charged masculinity and propagation of gendered identity that are involved in the Western tradition of portraiture.",

I think people in general shouldn't be romanticised even like we romanticise celebrities today, but to each their own. In the case of Napoleon he really needed that to be the case so he could stay in power for as long as he did.\n\nIf you want to romanticise militaristic black people, there are plenty of actual Africans that achieved a lot in that way and it'd be more meaningful than this.\n\nIf you'd put any random white guy into this painting, I'd react the same way. It just seems weirdly pretentious to explain it that way. I like the art though.",

He literally walks up, introduces himself, and asks them to be his muse. So not only is he subverting expectations by inserting \"peasants\" into the iconography of the oligarchs, he's empowering basic men and women by making them his muses and cementing their likeness into art history, and he's also empowering viewers by inserting their likeness into a portion of history, and art history, that vehemently rejects and torments us.

This isn't new, and will probably continue for a while still. If it's bizarre to you that the idea of a black person leading an army would be considered transgressive, that's good for progressives. That's what we want.\n\nBut we also want it to be known (at least for a little while longer) that this was and is still considered transgressive in some places. Well... I mean I don't know about *this,* Napolean is like 200 years old. He might have chosen a more contemporary example.\n\nI'm also not deeply ingrained in race conflict. It's just that this is fundamental knowledge about american society, and if you're an american you have a right to know it. Depictions of black people in positions of leadership and power is an ongoing conversation which has been continuing for decades. Where you fall in that conversation is up to you, but you should know the conversation exists, and it's probably been going on for longer than you've been around, and will almost certainly continue long after we're both gone.\n\nIf you're not an american then I can't make any statements about your society, and you might be able to disregard this, but I can't guarantee it.

Ultimately the point is lost on me, ~~great paint though. I do like how the artist finds his subjects. I think that is really neat~~",

I just think the artist/OPs explanation of it was pretentious.\n\nAs far as the issue, i dont see how inserting a POC is making a statement. Not every piece of art has to be for an issue or make some profound statement. The art itself and the way the artist made it is really cool I think but the paragraph explnation OP included is dumb. Feel free to disagree but thats just my 2c",

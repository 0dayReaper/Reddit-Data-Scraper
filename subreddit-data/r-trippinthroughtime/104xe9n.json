He has denounced questionable practices such as the sale of indulgences and the church's corruption. He was an educated theologian and linguist who translated the entire Bible into German for the benefit of the common people. Unfortunately, this has led to centuries of wars across Europe. The road to hell is paved with good intentions.",

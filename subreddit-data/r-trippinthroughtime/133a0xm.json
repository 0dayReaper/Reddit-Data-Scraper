You feed them and tidy their shit up, that\u2019s basically all that is required. Of course I play with them and love them, I work hard to give them the best possible life I can. But it\u2019s not on par with how much work a dog is. If I\u2019m out for work I make sure there\u2019s food down, and I can just leave them for 8 hours. They just sleep and have a little run about, they\u2019re fine. I would t get a dog (as much as I\u2019d love one) because I wouldn\u2019t want to leave it alone that long.",

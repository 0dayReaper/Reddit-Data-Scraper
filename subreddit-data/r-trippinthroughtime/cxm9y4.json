When you ingest Cocaine with elevated levels of Cortisol in your system (e.g. feeling extremely guilty), it actually accelerates the bodies aging process causing you to lose hair, lose height and gain weight.  *Brevis Crassus,* or Danny Devito Syndrome.  \n\nIt's particularly ugly on one of my clients.  16 is a young age to turn into hollywood's anti-sex symbol, but if Cocaine is what's going to bring her happiness, who am I to get in the way?",

He had two children with her. \n\nThere is no evidence that he ever had an affair during his marriage, though he did have a strange situation with a sort-of second family with a Mrs. Stevenson and her daughter Polly during his 15 years in London. \n\nAfter his wife passed, he loved flirting with women and wrote about it, but still no clear evidence exists that he was unfaithful, let alone fathering an additional 12 children with other women. \n\nIt's too bad that people are so quick to spread unresearched information on history that becomes common belief. \n\nGeorge Washington didn't chop down his father's cherry tree either.",

He swam nearly every single day. He was an inventor. He grew up in poverty and retired by 40. He was a musical master. He wrote songs, poems, pamphlets, you name it - and he didn't judge. The man was dope handsome as fuck, sleeves rolled up, modelling for Mens Fashion Advice magazine, clean as an Ox ballsack.\n\nThe lady's he had, forgiving his poor standing early in life, were innumerous. But what did this Professor Hulk do? Deflower all the virgin brides to be? No - A man of such talent has no energy for that squabble - No, he took to the lady of the street and kept everything business for business, dollar for dollar.\n\nDon't be fooled, Franklin was a handsome as fuck hunk, with a body like Arnold, and humoral talents of Steve Martin and curiosity of Carl Sagan, packaged into one blessed being.\n\nProfessor beast mode Franklin was no joke. He had piles of bitches, cause anything less would have denied &amp; shamed the human race : when god gives us greatness, it is our responsibility to take a piece of that greatness with us, however we can. Franklin was the original Benjamin, in the flesh. 100 units made the man, and he was totally, 100%, the absolute.\n\nAin't no shame in sharing that game.",

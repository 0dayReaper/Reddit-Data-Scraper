                            "comment": "A source from this thread had an [interpretation](https://vulgarcrowd.wordpress.com/2015/10/19/the-naughty-nun-a-raunchy-woodcut-from-1555/) from the wordplay. I say \"interpretation\" because it's art, but it's extremely on the nose. I bolded the meaning.\n\n&gt; We see a slightly depressed looking nun trying to bribe the housecat with a fish as an exchange for an extremely erected penis the cat is running around with.  In the background we see an amused fool flaunting a pair of male underpants. The quote on the bottom reads \u201cFlaisch macht Flaisch\u201d which translates into either \u201cflesh gives flesh\u201d or \u201cflesh equals flesh\u201d. This depiction is found in the Rijkmuseum in Netherlands, artist unknown and with the description \u201cNun walks with fish in hand chasing a cat , she wants to trade the fish with a penis that the cat has in its mouth. A jester watches through a window frame\u201d.\n\n&gt; Obviously this is a humorous satire with a very naughty message: driven by her carnal desires the nun wants to get her hands on the erected penis and tries to bribe it from the cat. ***The quote \u201cFlaisch macht Flaisch\u201d can possible be connected to german wordgames: the word \u201cfleisch\u201d can be tied the german word \u201cFleischeslust\u201d, with the same meaning as \u201cdesires of the flesh\u201d, showing that the nun have sexual reasons for hunting the cats prey. Also the german word \u201cFleisch\u201d could be a slang for, well, the penis.*** Simply put: the nun wants the bratwurst! But why does she use specifically a fish to bribe the cat? It could either be derived from the catolic medieval practice of eating fish on fridays. Or its simply a clever trick as fish is a wellknown favourite dish for felines.\n\n[Emphasis mine]",

If the last word is an adjective, then this adjectiv \"flaisch\" is the state that desire puts you in, for example: horny. The question now is if there is or was an adjective in a German dialect which sounds very semiliar to the word \"Fleisch\" in the same dialect.\n\nJust like Goethe managed to rhyme \"neige\" with \"Scherzenreiche\":\nAch neige,\nDu Schmerzenreiche,\nDein Antlitz gn\u00e4dig meiner Not!",

In a sexual context it's just referring to the bare flesh of humans and can refer to desiring male as well as female bodies/flesh.\n\nThe theory that this is protestant satire isn't convincing me, either, without having any further context which would indicate that. The story of the horny nun is much older than the Reformation and a common motive in medieval and Early Modern German comedic literature ('Schwank'). The most extreme example of it would be *Das Nonnenturnier* (The Nuns' Tournament) which was written in the 15th century. In that story, a knight is convinced to cut off his own (sentient) penis by an evil woman and disposes of it below the stairs of a convent where a nun discovers it. Soon other nuns join and it turns out that everyone wants to have the penis for themselves. This ends up in the nuns beating and injuring each other in a tournament. During the chaos, the penis suddenly gets lost, the nuns come to their minds and decide to never talk about what has happened.",

The fish can be connected to the catholic tradition of eating fish on friday, or abstinence from eating meat.

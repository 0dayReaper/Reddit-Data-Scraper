Find me an exception in the law or other definition that an exposed child, photographed or drawn, does not count as pornography if they are breastfeeding. Tell me that breastfeeding images can't easily be used as pornography by some strange individuals. Again, technicalities and perspectives. Obviously people have the ability to perceive the meaning and intent behind a peice of art and give it an exception based on context so naturally that most would never even consider it to fall into a category that it technically could.\n\nWhy tf would I write an acronym if I don't know what it stands for?",

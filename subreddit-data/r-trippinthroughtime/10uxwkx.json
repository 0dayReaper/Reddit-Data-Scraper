It can provide a way to buy things for others, which makes me smile. But I'm still horribly unhappy, I am just not living off credit cards anymore. My salary has provided stability and that can (and does) mean a whole hell of a lot, but I still struggle every day and don't know how to make it better. \n\nI used to think that people who said money can't buy happiness were just not shopping in the right places. But - in my case, at least - doesn't bring you peace or self-worth. It doesn't take away a lot of the issues I have with myself, my past, or with other people. I can just afford to drink and eat away the emotions, which is of course just a vicious cycle to further mental problems. You can call this me talking out of my ass, I'm a total internet stranger. But just a short anecdote has been in both of the proverbial boats.",

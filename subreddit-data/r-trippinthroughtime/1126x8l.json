He is known as a \u201cgenre\u201d painter, that is everyday scenes with often lively interiors bearing a moralizing theme. Steen is concisered unique among his contemporary colleagues for his humor\n\n*The Sick Woman* is oil painted on canvas in a baroque style with its deep color, drama and dark background. It is believed that the ailment befallen our protagonist is lovesickness. The theme of lovesickness was extremely popular in both painting and the theatre in the seventeenth century. Suppressed desire led to a vague syndrome known as \u2018hysteria\u2019. The satire is played out with the arrival of the doctor, in this case an old spinster with an enema syringe.",

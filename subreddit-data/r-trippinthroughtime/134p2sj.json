At a feast, Salome (their daughter) danced for Herod and he was so pleased that he offered her anything she wanted. As she had no idea, she asked her mother for advice, and the vengeful Herodias told her to ask for John's head. So she did, and Herod, while troubled at first, accepted. John was arrested and decapitated and the head on a plate was presented to Salome as a gift. She took no part in the killing herself.",

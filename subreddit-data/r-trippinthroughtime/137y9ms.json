They walked Roman v\u00edas, used Roman baths, and were conscripted into their legions. Their kings had submitted to the Romans and their elephants, and had governed and taxed their regions according to Roman dictates. The term often used for the people of the 4th and 5th centuries is Romano-British.\n\nBut by the time of the Viking Expansion, the continent was mostly Christian and ruled by the Angles.",

It was pretty normal to go fight a war for no reason other than to get more wealth for your state. A very \"us\" vs \"them\" time. That i one part that is cool about romans though, that they were so powerful that they were more about taking the wealth and leaving the culture to prevent uprisings vs the overall large state. They basically strolled in and were beat the fuck out of a civilization and said, \"okay you are roman now, dont revolt and this wont happen again\". Basically just a big protection money gang scam lol.",

The frequency of war was much higher but the costs of war were much lower. Total war wasn\u2019t a thing in the West until the Napoleonic era. There were few dedicated troops, most armies were made up of peasants and serfs, led by yeomen. The scale and scope of conflict was limited, as most conflicts were not clashes of nation-states but smaller factions. \n\nConflicts today are infinitely more brutal, deadly and violent. The frequency has only decreased as the costs of war have increased.",

If people find this triggering it's not like a mental breakdown, it's like getting a photo of a big spider when your arachnophobic. It's just straight up not pleasant.\nYour lack of empathy really annoyes me",

But this person was one of the first commenters to affirm that in the top comment, even if they\u2019re not being tactful in their latter ones. I think you can find the post in bad taste and still think putting a trigger warning is excessive. You\u2019d have to put a trigger warning for this whole sub because old art depicts a lot of atrocities. I don\u2019t know where we draw the line. NSFW seems like the best way imo, otherwise wouldn\u2019t everything that is marked such also get a trigger warning?",

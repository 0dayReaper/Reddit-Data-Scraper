They really only ended up annoying anywhere they came across (in Europe and the byzantines, mind you) by having to steal food and supplies since they were too poor to actually take care of themselves and then got massacred by the seljuk Turks since they were just farmers, not soldiers. But just untrained men, women, and children\n\nThey also started murdering the Jews in the rhine region as they went east because why not. Got so bad the local churches were sheltering the Jews from the crusade\n\nSuffice it to say, they didn\u2019t really have any time to \u201cenjoy temptation\u201d between the battles and sieges because all they did was walk east while being a nuisance to everyone, getting sent over to Anatolia and left at a decrepit fort for a while, and then when they went forward they got slaughtered in their first battle against the Seljuk Turks.",

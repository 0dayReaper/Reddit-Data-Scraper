The word used to describe it was just fun to say, and I imagine to sing...bibo! (I am drinking,  from bibere, to drink).\n\nHistorically speaking,  before water treatment and sanitation was a thing,  wine and beer were necessary for survival.  Monks and nuns were major producers of that staple. So...bibo!",

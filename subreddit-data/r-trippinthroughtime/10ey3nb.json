He was largely forgotten until the 20th century (1900's) where his work was rediscovered and became highly admired.",

Usually working people acting immodest and unrefined which attracted sales from the very upper class. Pieter Breugel also did these types of portraits in his time with lower-classes living their lives and a lot of pants around the ankles. Art history is amazing!\n\nHumans are never \"refined\" as we evolve through the ages. From lewd, vulgar graffiti in Ancient Greek times to Chaucer's writing of female knights farting on everyone (long-assed Berengier?). This is nothing new to our history.",

While the other commenter is strongly suggesting that Sweerts is making a joke, it seems more likely that this is a typical baroque vanitas painting. This would also explain why the artist is looking over his shoulder with a slighlty concerned look, knowing one won't live forever, and drawing the viewers attention to the skull to show them that it's not any different for them (\"memento mori\" - remember that you die).\n\nSweerts' art also isn't immodest or vulgar like some of the art of his contemporaries. He did produce genre paintings of the lower classes but debaucherous drinking scenes, vomiting people and sexual acts in taverns aren't something you'd find in his paintings. His subjects are always painted in a dignified manner and other than both being genre painters I don't see the similarity to Pieter Bruegel (the latter being a renaissance painter) at all.\n\nThat doesn't mean that the baroque era didn't also produce tongue-in-cheek pieces. It was a very contrastive time that is defined by more than just death, vanitas and stiff pious people. I just don't see enough signs pointing at the other commenters' analysis here.",

He almost looks partially aroused. It's a big middle finger from a talented person who doesn't give a fuck. He died four years after this self-portrait at 45 years old.",

To the right you can see a ballroom with a partying crowd, who don't care about the bad news, they just want to have fun. The only person who cares is the jester and he can't really do much about it. \n\nThe painting was done by Jan Matejko, who painted many events in Polish history. One of his most famous works is *Bitwa pod Grunwaldem*, which is absolutely enormous, really stunning to see in person.",

Downvotes for non-relevancy. And, it's a pity we can't find a way to prevent people from downvoting relevant comments that they just don't like. That's why so many subreddits are nothing more than echo chambers.\n\n--\n\nPerhaps AI will be able to determine the relevancy of comments and  block/downvote comments for non-relevancy.",

Entirely destroyed by the Nazis it was rebuild in recent decades and is well worth a visit. \n\nedit: accidentally posted this twice so I will add some more information to make up for my sins.\nAudio guides are available in many languages and are generally very high quality. I do NOT recommend touring the palace entirely unguided. The audio commentary points out which parts of the palace and the furniture are still original,that is they were saved during the war, and gives important background information. There is one room that has a painting which has all of the different layers visible so that you can see how it was made using a camera obscura. I thought that was very cool.\nIf you do not want to rush I would estimate that the entire collection plus the audio guide will take you at least 5 hours. Combine this with a stroll through the restored old town and some nice food and you have spent a nice day in Warsaw before heading to the Vistula for some evening entertainment on the river front.\nI would also really recommend the Museum of the history of Jews in Poland (or whatever it is called). It is one of the best museums I have visited in the last 5 years, but a full tour of the exhibition will take roughly forever and I would not plan another major venture on the same day.",

Entirely destroyed by the Nazis it was rebuild in recent decades and is well worth a visit. \n\nedit: accidentally posted this twice so I will add some more information to make up for my sins.\n\nAudio guides are available in many languages and are generally very high quality. I do NOT recommend touring the palace entirely unguided. The audio commentary points out which parts of the palace and the furniture are still original,that is they were saved during the war, and gives important background information. There is one room that has a painting which has all of the different layers visible so that you can see how it was made using a camera obscura. I thought that was very cool.\n\nIf you do not want to rush I would estimate that the entire collection plus the audio guide will take you at least 5 hours. Combine this with a stroll through the restored old town and some nice food and you have spent a nice day in Warsaw before heading to the Vistula for some evening entertainment on the river front. \n\nI would also really recommend the Museum of the history of Jews in Poland (or whatever it is called). It is one of the best museums I have visited in the last 5 years, but a full tour of the exhibition will take roughly forever and I would not plan another major venture on the same day.",

The number of possible permutations of 52 cards is \u201852 factorial\u2019 otherwise known as 52! or 52 shriek. This is 52 times 51 times 50 . . . all the way down to one. Here's what that looks like: \n80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,\n975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000.\n\nTo give you an idea of how many that is, here is how long it would take to go through every possible permutation of cards. If every star in our galaxy had a trillion planets, each with a trillion people living on them, and each of these people has a trillion packs of cards and somehow they manage to make unique shuffles 1,000 times per second, and they'd been doing that since the Big Bang, they'd only just now be starting to repeat shuffles.\n \nMany casinos use the child's approach to shuffling with new decks of cards, i.e. spreading all the cards out on the table and jumbling them before collecting them back into a deck. This is called 'washing' the deck or the 'Corgi' shuffle; casinos or tournaments often use it when introducing a new pack to initially randomise it. If you can riffle shuffle cards perfectly \u2013 i.e. ABABAB, as some casino dealers can \u2013 it actually makes the order slightly less random than if you shuffled the cards imperfectly.\n \nTo mix up a pack of cards thoroughly you need at least seven imperfect riffle shuffles. Any less and there is still a vestige of order; any more and the rewards of the extra shuffle are small. For some games like blackjack, where suits don\u2019t matter, you only need about four shuffles. \n\n",

I had to sit on the steps and crawl my way up, having to carry a briefcase. Could not do it on crutches. Could also not drive and people in the bus and subway don't care if you are disabled nowadays :( They just want to sit themselves and be the first one to enter a carriage.\n\nThat time i really felt like: \"Wow, i should take my every day walking more for granted.

They put me under general anesthesia (finally got a good sleep because congestion makes sleeping impossible, lol) and when I woke up they were done. The recovery was the hardest part - my nose was swollen and it hurt for about 2 days. They did put a small tube in my nostrils to help me breathe, but it was pretty much impossible to breathe anyways because of the blood/mucus. And yes, they do stuff your nose with a lot of cotton. \n\n\nWhen they remove all the cotton (which can be a painful process) you feel immediate relief, but it gets blocked pretty quickly from the constant flow of blood+mucus...which goes on for around 2 days more. After 2 weeks I could breathe properly and my sense of smell came back after 3? weeks. \n\nNow I can breathe again, 9/10 :)",

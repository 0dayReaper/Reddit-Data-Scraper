I'm pretty sure they did this with the score as well, although it's been a while. Still can't really do everything the book does, but it was neat to get those visual/audio interpretations.",

They kinda piss me off, even if the Matrix was a good movie on its own merits (kinda) they fucked up William Gibson so hard that it makes it hard to not get nerdrage, especially the second two.\n\nI feel like Denis Villeneuve would probably do it justice, potentially even David Lynch does he still do shit? Dune was a money adaptation idc what anyone says, sucks they didn't let him finish but that's showbiz baybee",

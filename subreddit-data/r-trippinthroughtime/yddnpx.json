Like at first it was bad, killed libido and desire for about a month, but now after about six months of it I feel so much better than before and have absolutely no side effects or sexual issues. Maybe I last slightly longer but I have no issue finishing with my gf at all, so don't be too scared. It helped me a lot to get out of my long depression. YMMV though, if you ever do take them.",

Just part of the foreplay. \n\nMy last gf liked it to get her in the mood, but once she was ready it was all about suction on her clit. Usually combined with a gentle rubbing motion with the tongue but just to keep it stimulated. And then using two fingers on her gspot, almost squeezing between them to the point of putting gentle  pressure on the interior portion of her clit. It\u2019s a much larger organ with only a small part outside so once she was relaxed I was able to put pressure on almost all of it at the same time. \n\nI mean we experimented a lot of different ways, she liked all the normal stuff and would show me what worked but then we just kept trying things. It wasn\u2019t hard to get her to cum generally, but the real earth-shattering wake-the-neighborhood orgasms came when I just did that building, rhythmic suction on the outside while stimulating her from the inside. Sometimes used a vibrator instead of my fingers but she liked the fingers better because I had more control and it\u2019s super sensitive. Plus after enough practice  I could bring her almost to the edge and hold her there for just long enough that she was like a balloon ready to burst.\n\nWe did try a toy  that put suction on it during intercourse and that was 10/10 for her. She could cum pretty hard during just piv sex but usually I\u2019d do the suction thing after maybe 20 minutes when she was ready to go for it again.  She wasn\u2019t overly sensitive on the outside either until after coming then it was like massively  hypersensitive. But as she was getting close  she liked the suction to be *really* hard, like to the point where my jaw would lock up after. But she\u2019d absolutely go to town for her part so I felt like I had to go all out for her too. \n\nNot sure what your fella does but I\u2019d suggest going for more suction if you\u2019re not too sensitive. I feel like no one ever explained it to me and I just had to stumble my way there from experimentation.",

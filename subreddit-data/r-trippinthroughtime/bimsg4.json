I had to sit there and count them all out for her, and she actually had WAY OVER that amount. I have no idea where the hell she got that many of them, but she did.",

But if you are, say, a restaurant, this could work well. If you have frequent and small amount sales on the other hand, it could be too impractical, since you have to have a cashier dedicated person anyway, the waiting time for every customer in line could blow up etc.. Personel cost more than anything else, so there's that.",

There used to be this very old man who would come in several times a night buying a few items each time. \nHe was quite frail and used to smell quite strongly of urine, and also clearly had quite thick cataracts in his eyes so his vision was poor.\nHe would come to pay at the counter and thrust his dirty hand into his pocket and pull out a handful of change, along with snotty tissues and fingernail clippings, and ask me to take what change I needed.\nIt used to really gross me out, but also I felt really sorry for him as he had to be very trusting for people not to rip him off, and I feel like he came in several times a night for a bit of human interaction.",

I think the biggest misconception a lot of people in this subreddit are having is that the people who don\u2019t want their change thrown at them are full of themselves, when in reality, it\u2019s basically not the change-throwing or having change dropped on the counter that\u2019s the issue. It\u2019s the personality type that goes with those instances where they drop it on the counter when you have your hand out or something similar that is the complaint here.\nI do wish we had a more standardized method for something like this, as it\u2019s acceptable either way in different places.",

                    "comment": "&gt;The notion that Harold died by an arrow to the eye is a popular belief today, but this historical legend is subject to much scholarly debate. A Norman account of the battle, Carmen de Hastingae Proelio (\"Song of the Battle of Hastings\"), said to have been written shortly after the battle by Guy, Bishop of Amiens, says that Harold was killed by four knights, probably including Duke William, and his body dismembered. Twelfth-century Anglo-Norman histories, such as William of Malmesbury's Gesta Regum Anglorum and Henry of Huntingdon's Historia Anglorum recount that Harold died by an arrow wound to his head. An earlier source, Amatus of Montecassino's L'Ystoire de li Normant (\"History of the Normans\"), written only twenty years after the battle of Hastings, contains a report of Harold being shot in the eye with an arrow, but this may be an early fourteenth-century addition. Later accounts reflect one or both of these two versions.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Godwinson#Death",

Hadrada was like the main character in a video game. He went all over Russia, Eastern Europe, Levant, broke bread with the Caesar, did a lengthy service and became rich  to marry the Tsar's daughter, defeated the Danes. By the time he invaded England, he was old, had heirs and family and was really in a good place. He did it like you would do a side quest in a  video game, and went out in the way he wanted. And I just realized this turned into a Harold Hadrada comment instead of Harold Godwinson one.",

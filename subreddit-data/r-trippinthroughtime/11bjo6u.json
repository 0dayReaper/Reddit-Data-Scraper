Iron clothes.\n\nI finally said \u2018no more\u2019 when I woke up the one morning and my keys were in the back door; snow was melted on my shoes. I still don\u2019t know wtf happened!",

The first night he took some Ambien with me to get to sleep (jet lag).\n\nOh boy. We were laying down in bed, (I knew that much at least) catching up when he started staring over my shoulder. He said my curtains were swaying and moving like jellyfish tentacles. We had fun looking around my room and then I'm like well! that was fun now let's sleep. \n\nNope. He just kept on jabbering and he's a very quiet man. It was really sweet stuff, about loving me and how it feels to be together. But he started repeating himself. And I was ready for sleep. I kept trying to persuade him to lay his head down and close his eyes (that always put me down). Nothing doing, he didn't even seem to hear me.\n\nEventually an idea came to me, something I would never ever do or need to do normally. But I slowly reached out and physically put my hand over his eyes. I can't exactly describe it but he kinda stiffened up and stopped talking. It only took a few moments and then, under my hand, I hear him gently start to snore. I kinda guided him down onto the pillow and kept my hands on his eyes until I felt him fully relax. Once I was sure I went to sleep.\n\nThe last thing he remembers is the jellyfish curtains. He did not take Ambien  again. \n\n\nTLDR: My husband might be a chicken.",

Cocaine was the \u201chardest\u201d I ever went, and I\u2019m pretty sure I did meth once after being told it was \u201cMolly.\u201d \n\nFar and away, Ambien is the weirdest drug I ever tried. My roommate said I stumbled outside to smoke a cigarette with him, babbled a ton about the universe and other dumb shit, casually paused to throw my guts up next to the chair I was in, continued my rambling, then just went back inside like nothing happened. I don\u2019t remember any of this. I also found some things typed up on my computer the next day that sounded like they not only didn\u2019t come from me, but came from an entirely different species. I remember trying to read something and the words dancing around the page so that I couldn\u2019t focus on them. Just a weird time all around. \n\nThis shit literally makes you a different person while you\u2019re on it and the memory lapses are really unsettling. So is the aftermath of the weird behavior while you\u2019re on it. For example, one morning I woke up to find my kitchen spotlessly clean down to the base boards, EXCEPT I had made a full smoothie and then dumped it (I guess??) in the middle of the floor before or after apparently cleaning every other inch of the place.",

I\u2019d have interesting thoughts like \n\n\n\u201cI should write a book about a guy who can divine the future by listening to the sounds people make while chewing food.\u201d \n\n\nThen I\u2019d read some more until I started to nod. I\u2019d hear soothing voices from the box fan and have the BEST most creative dreams. \n\nAnyway, the next day I would wake up and slowly get bits and pieces back. I\u2019d have taken down a poster (or whatever) for unknown reasons. Whenever I returned to my book I would have to backtrack about ten pages too. It was like being Moon Knight or something. My psychiatrist won\u2019t let me get back on it because of the memory lapses. I\u2019m disappointed because it was consistently the best part of my day.",

My boyfriend was in the room, on the computer; he shifted in the chair and the shitty old thing creaked, and that snapped me properly awake. \n\nI saw him and I had no idea who he was.\n\nI'm *really* amazed that I didn't start screaming. I mean, there was this guy in my room who I didn't know. He was very careful with how he spoke to me when I started freaking out, very calm. Explained he was my boyfriend and that he thought I was having a bad reaction to some medication I took. I was really stressed, because what he was saying *felt* right, but I still didn't *recognize* him. I couldn't even remember his name.\n\nI cried a lot. He knew it must've had something to do with the ambien, because I'd never taken it before, so he Googled around, and then called his dad [who at the time worked at a pharmacy], and just tried to figure out what the fuck while I sat in my bed curled up against the headboard, crying and holding my head because I was so distressed that I didn't know who he was. *That* was the thing that bothered me most. Not the stranger in my room part, but that I didn't recognize him when he knew me. It's like a much worse version of someone walking up to you and greeting you by name and you having no idea who the fuck they are and just kind of smiling and nodding, because I didn't smile or nod, just cried hella.\n\nI don't really recall how that whole thing ended. I think eventually I was just tired out from crying so much when I was already exhausted from not sleeping well [college!], so I ended up actually falling asleep. The next day I remembered the incident, and how scary it felt. My boyfriend was super worried, and it took a bit to treasure him that I was back to normal because the whole incident had him panicking even though he'd been very cool and collected when he was trying to help me. We both agreed that NEVER AGAIN.\n\nProbably gonna remind him about it when he wakes up from his non-ambien-assisted nap.",

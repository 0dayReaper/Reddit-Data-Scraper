The major significance of a crucifix is it's brutality--and how Jesus was hung was extra worse what with the whipping and fancy crown.\n\nThe cross symbolizes more than just where Jesus died, but all the suffering that came along with it. And according to Christian doctrine, Jesus' internal suffering was probably worse than his external suffering (imagine taking on the sins of the world).\n\nAnyways, my point is that if the shotgun represented all that is represented in the cross, then yes, people probably would wear it.",

The Romans were using crosses as a method of killing monotheists as a way of undermining their revolution by using one of their beloved symbols as basically the murder weapon. By wearing a cross, modern Christians may ostensibly think they're honouring Christ by acknowledging his sacrifice, etc, but unconsciously they may also be continuing a tradition of refusing to allow this symbol to be taken away from them as the Romans may have tried to do by associating it with the death of one of their leaders.",

If you think about how simple the shape is, and how religion and superstition have been a part of the human experience for tens of thousands of years, the idea it wasn't used by anyone else prior to Christians would be much more surprising than the idea it was. Anyway, there's no need to guess because it's very well documented. I don't know what sources you'd accept, and I don't care enough about this topic to spend time linking a bunch of them for you, but if you search for \"pre-Christian use of the cross\" or something like that you'll easily find a LOT of Information if you genuinely want to know - including properly cited sources like encyclopedia britannica.\n\n\nThere are also written accounts of the form the cross, in the same form that is widely used now as a Christian symbol, being used as a pagan symbol as well an Egyptian one in reverence to a number of different gods. Even the idea of a cross with a god attached to it that we're joking about in this thread (ie. Jesus on the cross) was used in ancient Egypt hundreds of years before Christ, if not thousands - can't remember off the top of my head which God.\n\n\nChristians didn't invent religion, they didn't invent symbolism. They arguably didn't even invent most of Christianity.",

I certainly wasn't implying Christianity itself came from this one notion or that their use of the cross as a symbol of acknowledgement of Christ's sacrifice is wrong because of this. It certainly does mean what Christians say it means to them. I just brought it up as an interesting point that as a religious symbol it can represent other things as well as that one important idea - supporting the idea that as a religious symbol the importance of the cross is not 100% limited to the act of crucifixion. The part about Romans purposely using the cross for crucifixion to pervert its religious symbolism as an authoritarian intimidation tactic is a bit of a stretch compared to the other part, I agree, but it's an interesting idea.",

                    "comment": "While funny, the joke is based upon not understanding the christian belief. The reason the cross is the symbol of christianity is because Jesus died on the cross to alleviate us from our sins. We aren't worshipping the cross we are worshipping the act of jesus dying for us at the cross.\n\nFurthermore it is symbolzing the highest form of agape, sacrifcing yourself for the well being of others. \nBasically reminding us that we should all give our lifes and or best to make sure that others and future generation have it better than we do now. \n\nWith that in mind Nitzsches \"God is dead and we have killed him\" makes a lot more sense we stopped trying to create a better future, we became egocentric and prefer to distract ourselves instead of being mindful",

Setting ourselves apart from the author of life means we bring ourselves closer to death, and doing whats wrong means we incur a punishment. Christ lived a perfect, sinless, life, but took on the penalty for our sin anyways. \n\nWhen he rose from the grave, he demonstrated his power over sin and death, and inaguarated a new covenant - instead of trusting in the sacrifice of sheep and goats (which was a symbol of repentence), by repenting of our sins and putting our faith in Christ, we can join in his ressurection. He takes the punishment we deserve, and so we dont have to fear eternal death.",

It basically signifies the beginning of the religion.",

There are many takes and ideas on why this had to happen.  \n\nThe way I understand it as of right now which might not be correct is (granted I have a few unusual views for a Christian) God is a being with a sense of justice and order and He deemed it fit that you have to give up something to be forgiven of doing something wrong so before Christ people had to make physical sacrifices such as a lamb or something else to atone for their sin. \n\nGod incarnated as Jesus to \n1.Experience life as a human thereby experiencing intimately the imperfection that is entirely foreign to Him as a perfect being\n\n2. Offer Himself in love as the perfect sacrifice for the entire world",

For 300 years after Jesus died nobody worshiped the cross, until Constantine decided there needed to be a symbol to help pagans understand the idea of God/Jesus. It was a direct violation of the second commandment in the Roman catholic church has suffered the shortcut ever since.",

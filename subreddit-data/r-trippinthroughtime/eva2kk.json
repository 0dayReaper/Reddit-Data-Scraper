The way France\u2019s finances were run at this time were borderline feudal, to the extent that just supporting America near the end of the war led to a complete national bankruptcy. To look at the other side of it, the British government conducted the entire war of 8 years and spent \u00a3100 million, neither of which (the longevity and high cost) really made a dent in overall British fiscal power. That\u2019s not including the money spent on military operations against Spain, the Netherlands, and Mysore, which were happening at the same time during the Revolutionary War.",

The national GDP from 1775 to 1783 was successively higher each year, being around \u00a3120 million in 1775 and increasing. \n\nAdd to this the formidable fiscal interests coming in from outside of national income (Crown Colonies, East India Company), and a large and lucrative trade empire, a sum of that magnitude was not a great hardship for the government purse, especially (and more than likely) if it was part funded by long-term low interest loans, obtainable by fronting trade and/or land assets at an agreed value or offering a % of trade profit or local income on top of low interest repayments. \n\nThe idea here is that the British fiscal system was extremely advanced and worked extremely well. The French on the other hand did not have this level of financial canny, so were unable to readily put funds into a war chest and sustain those funds without taking on risky loans against an empty purse (you can thank the French royalty for sucking up a good portion of national funds and mismanaging almost all of their liquid assets). When the creditors came calling there wasn\u2019t anything left to pay them with, which led to bad credit and a drying up of any serious financial assistance and an inevitable bankruptcy.",

King George III and the British aristocracy had no part in financing the war (except for government taxation on the aristocracy). \n\nThe Bank of England, as it is now, was a regulator and did not extend funds to the government, only injected its own funds into the British economy to maintain integrity in British financial institutions. \n\nThe loans would have predominantly come from banking institutions, with a large percentage coming from foreign private banking concerns. This would have been imperative to keep homegrown banks fiscally rich and reduce the chances that British banks would loan more than they could afford and declare bankruptcy.",

Basically France was more of a bunch of nobles who wanted to do their own thing beforehand. He, via a lot of pretty canny mechanisms, basically removed the independence of the nobles by (1) forcing them to spend large amounts of their wealth frivolously, and (2) forcing them to come to Versailles (the golden palace you mentioned), which prevented them from scheming in their home counties. He was a very powerful ruler and permanently changed the political landscape of France. \n\nWhen he died, he left a serious power vacuum which later rulers were unable to fill. \n\nLouis XVI (16) was basically a kinda wimpy guy, and could only try to imitate the success of XIV (14). He tried the same tactics but it didn't work. That, plus having an unpopular queen (though most of what we hear of Marie Antoinette was basically negative propaganda and rumors), plus a seriously unfortunate couple of years of harvests, led to the revolution. Basically XVI (16) was set up to fail from the start. The shoes he needed to fill were too big. \n\nIf, instead, they had successfully continued on the course that XIV (14) had set, they may have developed a more integrated government that had more in line with a modern country. But that required more political sensitivity than XVI (16) could muster, and it all came out in the wash with a couple of revolutions anyway.",

We Germans and the French have history that goes back to the carolingian dynasty under Charles Martell (Karl der Gro\u00dfe). At some point the territory was split in a western and eastern empire. The western Francia later became France where the eastern Francia became the holy Roman Empire of the German Nation and much much later Germany. So there is that, but shit just got real when the French lost the German/French war of 1870/1871 and the Germans founded their first Empire in Versailles. That day the Germans and French became sworn enemies. You should think that this petty bullshit should be long forgotten by now but these weird thoughts still linger under the surface.",

Even if the spanish empire was the n\u00b01 empire during a period (which is debatable), the americain (and british) media would still talk about the british empire, because it's more relatable to them. Same reason why, for exemple, most movie on WW1 foccus almost exclusively on british troops, even tho the french (and the german of course, but you can't play show the loser side I guess, even if WW1 wasn't black and white like WW2 was) were way more numerous on the western front (and as usual, it totally skip over the eastern front).\n\nThe roman empire existed at a time that the \"english world\" didn't really existed (or rather, the people who would become their ancestor existed, but were so different from the way the current english world perceive itself today that they consider it totally separated), so since they have no \"self insert\", they can safely project themselves in the superpower of the time. But the british empire existed at the same time as the spanish empre, so the spanish empire is sweep under the rug.",

The bombardment killed 1,297 French servicemen, sank a battleship and damaged five other ships for a British loss of five aircraft shot down and two crewmen killed.\n\nThe attack by air and sea was conducted by the Royal Navy after France had signed armistices with Germany and Italy that came into effect on 25 June. Of particular significance to the British were the five battleships of the Bretagne and Richelieu classes and the two fast battleships of the Dunkerque class, the second largest force of capital ships in Europe after the Royal Navy.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/trippinthroughtime/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

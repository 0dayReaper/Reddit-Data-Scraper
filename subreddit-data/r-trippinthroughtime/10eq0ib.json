If you've studied greek or roman mythology, this story is famous, and its widely understood to be about rape.\n\n[here's more](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46265708)\n\n\"In the myth, the god Zeus turned into a swan and raped Leda, Queen of Sparta.That event had huge consequences, according to classical mythology: Leda's intercourse with the swan and then with her husband, King Tyndareus, resulted in two eggs, from which hatched Helen, Clytemnestra and the twins Castor and Pollux.\"\n\n[and more](https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/leda-and-swan)\n\n\"William Butler Yeats\u2019s daring sonnet describing the details of a story from Greek mythology\u2014the rape of Leda by the god Zeus in the form of a swan\u2014was written at the height of the poet\u2019s career, the same year he received the Nobel Prize for literature. \u201cLeda and the Swan\u201d is a violent, sexually explicit poem that has all of the lyricism and complexity of Yeats\u2019s later work, with its plain diction, rhythmic vigor, and allusions to mystical ideas about the universe, the relationship of human and divine, and the cycles of history.\"",

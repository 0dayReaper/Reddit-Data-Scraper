Holofernes, an Assyrian general, is about to attack Bethulia, the town where Judith, an Israelite widow, lives. Judith resolves to save her people.\r  \n\r  \nOne evening, accompanied by Abra, her servant, Judith goes to Holofernes\u2019s camp for dinner. He offers her wine, but she doesn\u2019t drink. He does. When he is drunk, she severs his head with the sword Abra has brought. Judith takes the severed head back to Bethulia. The Israelites are saved.",

Gentileschi's women never have the idealised almost vacant look of a posed model. They are always emotionally realistic. Her Judith has a job to do and is furious.",

I have the utmost respect for this incredible lady, up there with Kahlo or Basquiat or many other rebel artists I love. My memory is a bit foggy, but the details of her life are absolutely incredible.\n\nArtemisia had an insanely rough teenhood. Her mother died when she was young and she was raised by a caring and rich father, who encouraged her love of painting and learning. She was raped by a tutor at 15 or 16 as far as I remember. He was convicted thankfully, though not as quickly or severely as he should have been (she actually entered a courtship with her rapist under the promise of marriage, but this [thankfully] fell through), and she was aged forever by the trauma.\n\nAt this point she was already considered forefront in the field, and her traumatic experience transformed the way she painted (and saw the world). From that point on her works really reflect the torment and rage and oppressed nature of her existence. \n\nDuring the rape she was witnessed by a maid who didn't step in to help. This detail seemed to hit her the hardest, and she especially latched onto Judith and Holofernes as a therapeutic tale. The main detail is that Judith's maid immediately jumped in to help, and she was seeking that feeling of protection she didn't receive.\n\nHer interpretations carry such intense catharsis and emotive energy - they are, in my opinion, the most striking and dynamic works of Judith.\n\nShe went to Florence and ended up studying with some of the absolute Greats of not only painting, but physics as well, and learned intensely about the physics of spurting blood from Galileo himself IIRC. Until the 90s her works were attributed to male artists of the time, namely Caravaggio, as her father and she were greatly influence by his (and other masters'). Feels a bit ironic to see others' work falsely attributed to her now haha.\n\nHighly recommend [a trip to her wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_Gentileschi?wprov=sfla1) for those unfamiliar. I wrote a paper on her in art school and have been utterly in love ever since, and always happy to see the love spread \u2764\ufe0f\n\n(My facts here might be shaky but I tried to remember most of the basics! Currently diving through the wiki again myself so may come back to edit mistakes)",

Is it possible that the body, bones and blood were used to fertilize the earth and provide nutrient-rich soil for their agriculture? Bone meal is a thing. Blood meal is a thing. A sacrifice to Xipe Totec, the god of agriculture, for a good harvest? Give your life- give your blood and your bone so your people may eat.\n\nJust a theory.",

Especially now that theyre finding tons of locations of possible ancient ruins all throughout mexico and central america using LIDAR to see beneath the remote and inaccessible jungles. The olmecs and the aztecs were probably way larger civilizations than we know. I mean look at native americans- my own ancestors, their populations were almost totally destroyed by disease and tribal conflicts in the aftermath. I can only imagine the horrors of that, too.\n\nI dont think its fair to consider the aztecs barbaric, but it feels disingenuous to ignore the fact that human sacrifices *did* happen and were a part of their culture, willingly or not. It happened in places in Africa and even the west too, albeit in a more underground manner. Honestly, the entire subject is shrouded in mystery even though it was practiced all over the world... fascinating subject though.",

Ya dude, idk if you know this but school curriculums are not the same in every school and the narrative that the native people's gave away their land and disappeared peacefully is very common. If you don't know that, it's probably cause you've never spent time with either native descendants or POCs in general.\n\nYou obviously don't know what you're talking about as the \"Aztecs\" were part of a larger scheme of tribes and alliances that asked for tribute in the form of food, raw material and yes humans. They weren't even Aztecs but three separate tribes that compromised the empire.  Yes they still performed human sacrifice but unfortunately we won't ever know to what extent because of that pesky thing called colonization. Not to mention sacrifice was an honor to the people it was done to with complex, sometimes year long rituals of feasts, arts and dances needed to be completed to appease their gods. And this is only one small portion of the continent that did this. Further south it was not as common. Or up North where it was even less common than that. \n\nSo no I don't think the Spanish who destroyed not only this empire but all the others on the continent were \"just as bad\". I wholly think they are worse for destroying these cultures and erasing their histories.",

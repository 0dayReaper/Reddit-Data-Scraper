The RCC in Australia never formed a legal consolidated group, because of the status of Australia as a bunch of English crown colonies with the Church of England a lot closer to power than the RCC, so they stayed as separate legal entities to stop the Gubermint from crushing them. Seems it worked quite well stopping the RCC being sued for raping kids. Which they did A LOT.",

Each seperate franchise is a seperate business that just pays franchise fees to the corporation.  If some McDonalds franchise in Fiji starts boiling babies or some horrible shit like that, it is not like the *entire* McDonalds corporation is culpable.\n\nExcept in the case of the RCC, the legal/financial ties between each diocese and Vatican are even less.

You don't have to believe in the spirituality of the Pope in the slightest to see that he controls the Catholic Church. For example, every single bishop is officially confirmed by the Pope (who has sole power to choose who he wants), and each diocese is run by one of these bishops. Money aside, that's a pretty direct tie in my book.",

The only evidence was the personal testimony of the accuser, which was poked full of holes by evidence from Pell's defence and which in any case has never been enough on its own to fulfil the standard of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nMost of the media and the internet were prejudiced against Pell from the beginning, as anyone can see from the general reaction just after the case began. The High Court's verdict simply defended the presumption of innocence against a jury that lost sight of the standard of proof. The presumption of innocence clearly isn't very popular on Reddit, but it's the central principle of every English justice system and an essential part of a free society, so it should apply to hated Catholic priests as much as it should to everyone else, and I'm sure everyone who values fair justice was glad the Australian High Court agreed.",

They didn't say \"this was a bad trial and we should have a new one to make sure justice is done.\" They just said, \"Naw, we've decided he's free to go.\" \n\nWhat's the point of even having a jury if some judges are going to just decide for themselves anyway?",

Guilty is guilty, but not guilty means that the prosecution failed to prove guilt - it is not a declaration of innocence, as the court cannot prove a negative. It can only weigh whether the evidence presented is sufficient to prove guilt.\n\nIn this specific case, Pell was found guilty by a jury, and acquitted upon appeal when the appeals court found that the jury should have held doubt over his guilt. They did not indicate that they believed he was innocent, only that his guilt was uncertain enough that the jury's guilty finding was incorrect.",

This wasn't a technicality.",

Over the years these people rose to the highest levels of prominence in the Catholic church.\n\nI'm not sure if I agree with the theory as a whole, for example I've also heard that girls were abused as much as boys (I've never looked up the numbers) but I could see it having some validity.",

Gay men are no more likely to be sexually abusive towards children than anyone else. In fact, there are studies showing the [opposite is true](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1556756/). Child sex abuse against boys is 11 times more likely to be done by a heterosexual man, than a homosexual one.\n\nThe reason for this is that sexual abuse is about power, not attraction. Though the fact that Catholic priests are not allowed to marry or express their natural sexual drive is also likely linked. Though it's hardly just the Catholic denomination. [Every religion](https://www.ualberta.ca/folio/2020/08/researchers-reveal-patterns-of-sexual-abuse-in-religious-settings.html) and denominations have abusers within them.",

If you scroll down within that section, the report furthermore outlines possible contributing factors. It is likely a combination of several factors, including (as you rightfully point out) the Catholic Church's well known repression of sexuality, but also things like a cultivated sense of moral and societal superiority, a strongly hierarchical organisational structure, enormous failures in leadership (*cough* Pell *cough*), and specific aspects of Catholic doctrinal law.",

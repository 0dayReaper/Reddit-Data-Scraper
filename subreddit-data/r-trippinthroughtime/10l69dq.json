This led to her having insufficient oxygen upon the first hours of her life in this world, leading to developmental disabilities. Because she grew to be a \u201cdifficult child\u201d, her father Joe Kennedy Sr. had her lobotomized, which reduced her mental capacity to that of a toddler. Thereafter, she was institutionalized secretly to not \u201cshame the family\u201d. She lived into her 80s and died in the early 2000s. \n\n\u2018Last Podcast on the Left\u2019 did an excellent [episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7MzHCtzhQ29lvjkcnB0reU?si=-TkK7PTmTUC5OfcqxmrYUg) about her life in their Lobotomy Series a couple years back. Happy listening - Hail Yourselves!",

Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. She was a sister of President John F. Kennedy and Senators Robert F. and Ted Kennedy. In her early young adult years, Rosemary Kennedy experienced seizures and violent mood swings. In response to these issues, her father arranged a prefrontal lobotomy for her in 1941 when she was 23 years of age; the procedure left her permanently incapacitated and rendered her unable to speak intelligibly.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/trippinthroughtime/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

People are out there researching every conceivable link between anything and have been doing so for decades now. The big gaps are now things we have legal barriers to studying (marijuana in the US, other direct study of recreational drugs, etc) or things that we can't devise an ethical way to study except in retrospective ways (rare problems, cardiac arrest care in many ways, etc). We surely don't have perfect evidence for all the things we do but we have an immense amount of evidence for a lot of things and we have people actively asking questions about anything and everything with funding to back it up in many cases and now even AI to sift through data looking for trends that humans might miss. We can't stop where we are but we're not even close to doing so. Instead, we're still picking up speed.",

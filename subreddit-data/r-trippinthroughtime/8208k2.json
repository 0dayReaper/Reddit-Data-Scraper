With this type of massage, women had orgasms and experienced sudden, dramatic relief from hysteria. But doctors didn\u2019t call women\u2019s climaxes orgasms. They called them \u201cparoxysms\u201d because everyone knew that women were incapable of sexual feelings, so they could not possibly experience orgasm.\"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201303/hysteria-and-the-strange-history-vibrators)",

I remember something about how the doc said it was in his left side but others said the bullet was in his right side iirc. Basically the doc only tested the left side as to not be proven wrong. Not sure how true that is but I think the PBS special also stated this. You're right about capable, he was super popular and also wanted desegregation in the U.S. His policies are a big what if in our history.",

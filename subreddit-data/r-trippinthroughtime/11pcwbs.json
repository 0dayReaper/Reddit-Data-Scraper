The body always runs out of energy before my mind, and biology makes it difficult to overcum. \n\nI can still use other tools, and I very much enjoy it, but I'm physically desensitized for a bit after I finish, it's a come down no matter what for me even if my partner has also finished multiple times and we're both mentally still all about it. My brain is rearing to go, so is hers and her body is *more sensitive* by that point, and mine is just like \"Yeah, we here at least\".\n\n3 a day together is average, and that's apparently a lot, but I'm trying to masturbate more on top of it to also get my body used to enjoying everything while having already finished. I'm having to untrain my stamina because I've found I remain sensitive by finishing quick and often. It leads to a quick finish the first go (which my partner loves anyway, so lucky me), but makes it easier to do more in shorter time, and it's even kept me sensitive immediately following a finish to where I *think* I neared a male multiple orgasm. \n\nHonestly, I envy high sex drive women who can get the sex life my brain begs me for. I have all the pieces except my own body. I'm trying to tune myself sexually in that direction, we were all girls once upon a time after all, so maybe I can get close!",

I have a pretty high libido too, but one of the reasons we work so well together is because I like doing other things as much as, if not more than, penetration. As in, we may have been going for 45 minutes and she's come a couple of times, but I haven't taken my clothes off yet. We don't have sex every day anymore - maybe 4 times a week on average these days I'd guess - but we almost never have a session that is less than an hour, and we try to get in a \"sex day\" break from work every few months.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love penetration and I'm going to get off at some point in every encounter. But I really love playing with control, and my wife loves that she never knows when and how much I'm going to let her come. I get to enjoy myself with directing how she enjoys herself, and she gets what she needs to be satisfied. So it is possible, and has worked for us for 20+ years.",

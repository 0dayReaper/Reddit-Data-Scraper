I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don\u2019t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I\u2019m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.\n\nI was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I\u2019m trying to explain that I\u2019m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn\u2019t lose to anyone.",

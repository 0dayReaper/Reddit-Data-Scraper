Children wraps up that trilogy, then there's a thousand-ish year skip to God Emperor of Dune, which largely stands alone. Then another big time skip to Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse: Dune, which were clearly kicking off a new story arc with recurring characters, but Chapterhouse ends on a cliffhanger.\n\nEven without an ending, they're great books. God-Emperor is divisive - for most people it's either their favorite or least favorite - because it is a very different style and leans heavily into some of the philosophies of the series. Heretics and Chapterhouse introduce a lot of fan-favorite characters, even if we never got a conclusion.",

Also it clearly was inspired by Lawrence of Arabia, the fall of the Ottoman empire and so on.\n\nWhat people really liked was the world building, characters and weird, offbeat vision of the future (the David Lynch movie picked up on this heavily) with trippy space travel and magic witches fiddling with human history. It's such an interesting universe.",

It was 1996, 1998 and 2000 as release years.  One could say he had a lot of material stockpiled from over the years, but he did get them out pretty quickly.  He finally did get *Feast* out 5 years after *Storm*.  I know he's had issues letting world events bum him out, and there were plenty between 2000-2005.  And you are correct, the story just kind of ran away with him as he went to focusing on more characters.",

There were lots of other really weird changes too, like Arya and Jon were supposed to become romantically involved at some point. \n\nI believe he is infamous for just sorta sitting down and writing. Stream of consciousness without planning kind of thing. Most casual writers probably do this. A few authors can do this and shit out absolute gold. I think Stephen King has done it for some of his big hits. What's the one he says he can barely remember writing because he was on drugs the entire time?\n\nPlanning too much can be restrictive, but only planning vaguely can lead to serious plotting problems when you have a series as complex as GoT. There were endless discussions of the so-called \"Merenese Knot\" back in the day, wherein fans deduced GRRM had written himself into a massive plot corner and couldn't satisfactorily write the characters out of it. That he just kinda gave up is the consensus now.",

The show writers kept Tyrion likable instead being a bad influence Because of his anger at the red keep and his family.\n\n Magic is probably going to play a bigger role in the grand scheme of things as well in the books. However the show writers were very adamant about cutting out as much magic as possible.\n\n Like Aria being able to change her face into anyone It's probably going to be more useful than the one time she does to get revenge.\n\n Like there are some problems if you're adapting a story and you're leaving out big chunks of it.  The ending won't make as much sense when you get to the planned ending.",

Like, not only can he be endlessly creative and create interesting unique fantasy worlds, but he does so at nearly a Stephen King level pace. Man is DRIVEN. \n\nIt's insane to think he's only been active for 15 years but we already have 12 novels in his core Cosmere universe, which is already a GREAT pace. But he also finished out the Wheel of Time series, started and finished the Reckoners, and still has time for his 100 other side projects, short stories, and spinoffs.",

George RR Martin has cited them as a huge source of inspiration and I received the series as a recommendation after I asked a similar question to a friend. While obviously there are many differences given the sci-fi setting, but Dune is interesting in that the universe still has a kind of intergalactic feudal system with many similarities to the politics in GoT/ASOIAF. \n\nPlus the new adaptation by Denis Villeneuve that\u2019s coming out later this year looks absolutely incredible! The first movie will likely only cover the first half or so of the first book, so you\u2019ve got plenty of time to reasonably read it before the first movie comes out",

His books are similar in structure and size to Martin's in that his books have many perspective characters, with events happening all over the place, shifting perspectives every chapter or so; the settings are all at least a couple hundred years in the future (at least for the full novels) and every one has been a really great read. The series are relatively short (no longer than a trilogy for a complete story, though there can be multiple stories in the same universe) and he writes quickly enough that there's a new book every year or two.",

Years ago he did an interview where he said he hates dragons but, I think, his sister talked him into adding them.  \n\nThe next book has to be all dragons and ice zombies.  An idea he dislikes and an idea so overdone in the last decade that zombies are boring.  \n\nThere can't be any joy in writing that for him.  And he's already rich so he's just said \"fuck it, maybe Brandon Sanderson will sort it out after I die\".",

That it was supposed to be a tale of how Kvothe got back into the present world as an active participant in whatever is going on. He wrote The Slow Regard of Silent Things, so we know he can write and is still interested in the world. \n\nThe answer is probably that he's just an asshole and is unmanageable from the editorial side. He's got enough money to say 'fuck you' to his editor, that he won't budge an inch from his vision. And a third book will be a blockbuster, so they probably let him get away with a lot and view him more as a long-term investment.\n\nBut anyone with a critical eye saw the second book as a different thing altogether than the first. It was so \\*loose.\\* There was barely any through-line. It read more like an episodic than one tale. And that's fine, I think there's room in literature for that style of story. But cut any one of them out, training with swords, sexy time with mythical figures, etc. and you have a story that remains essentially the same.",

In my opinion, book 2 doesn't do anything interesting to justify breaking this mold. It's just... \"and then Kvothe does this...\" and \"then Kvothe does that...\"",

If anyone even asked if their had been any updates like 30 people would downvote you for daring to ask and scold you that the author doesn't owe you anything. Its infuriating. Rothfuss refuses to give any progress updates for a decade and gets all mad at people for even daring to bring it up. I still remember back in like 2016 he posted a poll on twitter asking if people would rather watch him livestream a game that was coming out that day or finish writing 2 chapters. You can guess what happened and he threw a hissy fit. Like, I get that theirs a lot of pressure to finish and its been ongoing for a long time, but you can't be the guy who refuses to address his audience for years on the main thing they follow you for and then be surprised when twitter trolls you for it when you bring it up.",

But that isn\u2019t my main beef. \n\nIn 1991, he releases book 3. Fucking banger, but ends on a cliffhanger where they are stuck on a suicidal riddle train (lol).\n\n1997, he finally writes another book, Wizard and Glass, but almost all the book is a prequel story. All that happens in the present is they get off the train.\n\n2003, 12 fucking years later, is when the story finally actually progresses past the fucking train cliffhanger in 1991.\n\nMeanwhile, he writes like 20 books, almost all having some bullshit and not really sensical tie-in to the Dark Tower. Kinda reminds me of Dr. Who in the Moffat years where every story has some bullshit tie in to a season-long plot arc but taken as a whole they don\u2019t really make sense, they are just mind-fuckery to get you to speculate on what will happen and how it will tie in with no real payoff.\n\nI gave up on the series when he wrote himself into the fucking 7th book.

BS did add some changes (like when he tied up 3 plot points in one chapter that had been dragging on for like 4 books each) but he mostly stuck to the plan laid out by RJ. I thought things were wrapped up pretty nicely.  \n\nEdit: it was Jordans wife who got things moving with Brandon Sanderson apparently. See the replies",

After Jordan died, Sanderson wrote a eulogy on his website which his wife Harriet later saw and proceeded to read his Mistborn series.\n\n\n&gt; \"Did you ever meet Robert Jordan?\"\n\n&gt; \u201cI saw him once at a convention but I didn\u2019t know him. I saw him as a fan and he wouldn\u2019t have known me from Adam. He asked his wife Harriet McDougal to find someone to finish the series and after he passed away, she went hunting. She considered it something of a dying request so she searched through a lot of fantasy authors. She hadn\u2019t heard of me, but she read my Mistborn series. She then called me up and asked me to do it. I didn\u2019t know I was being considered: it just came out of the blue. To be asked to finish the series was just astonishing and I wasn\u2019t expecting it. It was a little bit like winning the lottery when you haven\u2019t bought a ticket but someone you love has to pass away before you can win.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.gamesradar.com/interview-how-brandon-sanderson-ended-the-wheel-of-time/",

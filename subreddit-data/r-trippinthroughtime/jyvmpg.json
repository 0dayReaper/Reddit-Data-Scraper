People are not staying at their jobs for life as they used to, so people have no reason to unionize if they are not staying long-term. You can see this trend in professional jobs that are more stable and less turnover",

For all of the managers to move up to higher positions you had to train your replacement and simultaneously be fully trained for the new position. If all the managers did this and then the senior became the GM, the assistant became to senior, and the kitchen manager became the assistant. \n\nSo everyone was trained up, all the replacements were ready and our GM left. The senior assistant was being introduced by the district manager to other general managers as the new general manager for the location. Everyone was excited because we were all going to get a raise!\n\nCorporate decided they bring in a 20 year old girl that was not trained for the position to be the general manager. Then they hired a senior assistant manager that was an assistant manager at a Wawa gas station for 6 months. \n\nSo we were all furious. We had really good relationships with our crew, our numbers were better than anyone else in the area and we were the top-performing store. We talked both morning and night crew into quitting and moving with us to other positions that we had found on short notice for a competing company that had just opened a couple locations in our area. \n\nThe next day no one was there to open the store because we all quit. The entire store quit. Within a few hours they had managers and employees from all of the stores in the area brought in, they ran the store, trained up a new crew and within a couple days the entire store was fully staffed again.",

The activity of your work is a commodity, you as an individual are irrelevant. There are plenty of desperate workers out there who need an income. It doesn\u2019t matter who you work for, it doesn\u2019t matter who you rent from, it doesn\u2019t matter what bank you go to or what stores you buy from. \n\n\nWe need our own groups and organizations that bars from participation anybody who can fire us, evict us, or arrest us, and which serves the interests of working people exclusively. It\u2019s called building dual power; essentially nesting our own political and administrative organs within the rotting husk of capitalism that can support and defend work and rent strikes, radically educate people to recognize themselves as a class, and coordinate social labor to provide for working people\u2019s material needs while simultaneously empowering them to carry on and develop the work themselves. As we grow we eat what is around us, gobbling up farms and factories and stores and schools and neighborhoods and apartment blocks and whatever else we need. \n\n\nThey can\u2019t fire us all, they can\u2019t evict us all, they can\u2019t imprison us all. We already have the power.",

We left the store in disarray because that's how they treated us. We were disrespected not only to our faces but then laughed at behind our backs. The district manager was fired about four months later for not following company policy.\n\nThe problem with your last paragraph is that you will never get everyone to commit. Someone will always need a dollar bad enough to get out there and work. A company man will always still show up. Look at the polarization between the political parties in the United States and the difference in the supporters. You'd be lucky if you could get half the people to commit. Half of them wouldn't even piss on you to put the fire out.",

Drunk people can be a fucking nightmare cos they won't follow rules. But you're basically cucked, because its your job to cater to them. They only get kicked out for doing awful stuff.\n\nShout out to the Mcdonalds/KFC/whatever employees that work in city centres across the UK. Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Bristol, London boroughs. Thats a horrendous job keeping people happy on Friday Saturday nights. Working class heroes.",

Party started at 10pm and there was already someone passed out on her living room floor by 11:30. I didn\u2019t drink at all, and when I asked her what she had to eat, she said she has some bread and cheese if that helps. \n\nI shook my head and told her my boyfriend and I were leaving, but we\u2019d be right back. \n\nI called the closest McDonald\u2019s and warned them that I plan on ordering 40 cheeseburgers, and French fries and we would be there in 10 minutes. We stopped by McDonald\u2019s, paid and they said it\u2019d be 15 minutes. I said great and went to buy the waters and picked up the food on our way back.  \n\nEveryone was hammered drunk and she lived in a one bedroom one bath with her boyfriends grandmother who didn\u2019t want anyone to stay over. \n\nI took the booze, made sure everyone ate and my boy friend and I took turns driving people and their cars home one at a time until everyone was gone. \n\nI don\u2019t regret spending my whole night where I wasn\u2019t the hostess taking care of everyone. I regret being friends with a person who was so short sighted and didn\u2019t care about the welfare of her guests. She expected everyone to drive themselves home around 2am once all the booze was gone. She\u2019d get mad if her guests weren\u2019t taking shots with her. She\u2019d yell asking why is this bottle not gone yet?? Sure, adults make their own choices but these were young 21-24 year olds. It happens.",

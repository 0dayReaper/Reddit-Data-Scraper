Even just if you substitute 1/3 of the water for it when cooking rice it gives rice way more depth. Its fantastic for making a sauce out the yummy bits in the bottom of the pan, too. Ended up finding out though that you can get a whole gallon of it at my local asian supermarket for like $4. Normally just a small 12oz bottle of it is almost that much in my normal grocery store.

Also included and I regret nothing in buying (I use them in other recipes now too) are dark soy sauce, fermented chili paste (Not long lasting but used often), shaoxing wine, white pepper, and sichuan peppercorns.\n\nFirst item on my list, favorite way to use it is on Salmon in the easiest recipe of all time. Literally just brush the dark soy sauce over the flesh side of the salmon filet and then sprinkle with white and black sesame seeds, cook flesh side down starting to brown and flip, cook to finish. Perfect sesame crusted salmon that is low calorie. The dark soy sauce is sweet and salty and provides the majority of the flavor, but the toasted sesame seeds add the extra bang.\n\nGotta admit just about anything that would be a stir fry you can splash shaoxing wine into it to add some rich flavor to it, provided it's thai or chinese based. Can be a bit too strong for some dishes and may be trial and error.",

Turns out, most of the ingredients that I bought that were cheap and lasted forever and seemed like \"specialty items\" but actually were the most common things among any sort of asian cooking and could be crossed over to do asian fusion in traditional dishes. At the bare minimum I recommend Sesame oil, rice wine vinegar, and dark soy sauce.\n\nI don't see dark soy sauce used in many recipes in gif form, but it's basically a condensed and sweetened soy sauce. It's very thick and almost thin syrup, but it has so many applications and is used heavily in traditional chinese and surrounding regions recipes. I can't ever find mine locally but you can buy an 18oz bottle on amazon for like $8. (link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001EJ4C0/)",

To be clear I\u2019m not trying for authentic Chinese, I\u2019m trying for authentic strip mall Chinese. Everything I read is that the true secret was in the shao xing wine. As I\u2019ve found recipes that use it, I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019ve come really close or completely mimicked the recipe I love from strip mall Chinese.  I\u2019ve also noticed the use of dark and light soy sauce helped a lot also.  \n\nI can\u2019t say that general tsao doesn\u2019t use sherry. Just that I see that as a common stand in for shao xing. So I figured that is what it is doing in this recipe. \n\nAlso, get all your Asian sauces from Asian markets. I got massive bottles of light and dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, fish sauce, garlic Chile paste, hoisin sauce, sesame oil, and shao xing for like $40.  That probably would have been $100+ in my typical grocery store. \n\nBest of luck!",

They refer to it as honey chicken but It's the best I've ever found. Better than any takeout I've ever gotten. All you do is alter the sauce to make it General Tso's.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/hfxledIyK6I",

If you don't add in the right amount of baking powder you can taste it so watch out. The salt and garlic/onion powder are important for the flavor so add a bit more than you usually would think is enough.\n\nLeave your cubed chicken in it for an 45-hour, and it'll be a nice thick consistency.\n\nPop it in a fryer, take them out and let them cool but don't get them mashed under the weight of the other nuggets, once their all fried put them back in the fryer.\n\nThat way it'll get a nice golden brown colour and make it crispy while the chicken inside is perfectly cooked.\n\nThen for the sauce I mix Rice vinegar, soy sauce, [sweet chili sauce](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/9e676d68-cc32-4162-9269-9b7af091e4ce_1.943614c707027340b4a64a991d9ead09.jpeg), and more red pepper flakes to make it hotter.\n\nPut it into a sauce pan and mix and thicken it up for about 5 minutes with cornstarch slurry to thicken it properly.\n\nI usually only make this when there's a large group of people and there's never any leftovers.\n\n[I subscribe to this lady's cooking style so that's why there aren't any measurements, sorry.](https://youtu.be/1UjzXJcxr8k?t=35) I've just done it so many times by eye that I don't need it and kinda forgot what the measurements were originally.\n\nTinker around with it and you'll find that this is a pretty tasty dish.",

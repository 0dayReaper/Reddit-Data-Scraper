I also add a blend of fresh ginger (galangal if I can find it), garlic, and lemon grass. I blend them into the paste with chicken stock.\n\nHard to tell from the vid how long you fried the curry paste for, but it's important to fry it in oil to bring out the flavor.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend stewing a makrut lime leaf in curry dishes if you want to capture Thai flavor. It is an indispensable flavor of southeast Asian cooking that often gets overlooked in the states. Once you add it you'll realize *that's* why your dish doesn't taste like the restaurant versions.\n\nMost Asian grocery stores carry them where I'm at. Fresh ones are in the fridge, but they keep well in the freezer.\n\nEDIT: I confused brands. I only use maesri when cooking vegan/vegetarian as it doesn't have shrimp paste in it. My favorite paste is Mae Ploy.",

I would have preferred it to be spicier, but I thought the jar was cute; alas...twice as expensive and not as good IMO. Should have stuck with Maesri.\n\nI used a Thai/Chinese shiitake mushroom which are meatier than the more delicate shiitake caps. If using shiitakes with thinner caps, adjust cooking time as needed as they have the propensity to dry out quickly.\n\n* 1 pound ground chicken\n* 2 eggs\n* 5 cloves garlic, peeled\n* 4 Thai chili peppers, trimmed\n* 3 scallions, scrubbed and trimmed, divided\n* 1 shallot, peeled\n* 1 tablespoon lemongrass paste\n* \u00bd\u2013\u00be cup panko or plain breadcrumbs\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced\n* 6 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems discarded and caps sliced\n* 2 tablespoons green curry paste\n* 3 cups water or chicken stock\n* 15-ounce can of full-fat coconut milk\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* **For serving:**\n* Lime wedges\n* Crispy shallots\n* Chili oil\n* Cooked rice noodles\n\n**Prepare the meatballs:**\n\n1. Combine the chicken and eggs in a large bowl. Season all over with salt.\n2. Place the garlic, Thai chili peppers, shallot, and 2 scallions in a food processor and pulse until minced.\n3. Add the minced aromatics to the chicken along with lemongrass paste. Use your hands to combine. Add \u00bd cup panko or breadcrumbs and mix to combine. If the mixture is too wet, add an additional \u00bc cup of breadcrumbs. Mix until combined and let stand 10 minutes.\n4. Heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat in a wide pot. Add a teaspoon of the meatball mixture and fry until cooked through. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.\n\n**Fry the meatballs:**\n\n1. Form the mixture into meatballs and fry for 3\u20134 minutes per side until browned all over. They need not be cooked through. Transfer to a plate.\n\n**Cook the mushrooms and onions:**\n\n1. If the pot seems dry, add another tiny drizzle of oil. Add the onions and mushrooms and cook for 7\u20138 minutes. Stir the mushrooms regularly and continue cooking until they brown around the edges. Season with salt.\n\n**Sizzle the paste:**\n\n1. Add the green curry paste and let it sizzle in the pot for 30 seconds. Toss to coat the mushrooms and onions in the paste. Pour in the water or broth.\n\n**Simmer the meatballs:**\n\n1. Add the chicken meatballs to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 25 minutes or until meatballs reach 165\u00baF. Taste and season the broth to your preferences.\n\n**Finish the broth:**\n\n1. Mince the remaining 1 scallion, keeping the white and green parts separate.\n2. Stir the coconut milk and white parts of the scallion into the broth. Simmer 5 minutes.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Ladle the broth over cooked rice noodles. Garnish with the minced scallion greens, lime wedges, and crispy shallots. Add a drizzle of chili oil if you like.",

                    "comment": "Soup may have been a better descriptor, but AFAIK *curry* doesn't always refer to a specific dish. There are specific curry dishes (IE, *chicken curry* in South and Southeast Asian cuisine, Caribbean cuisine, and Japanese cuisine, which I think is what you're referring to). This is made from curry paste, the backbone of various Thai dishes like soup, stir fry, and stews. You can use the curry pastes for a lot of different things, like this [recipe](https://www.eatingthaifood.com/thai-gai-pad-prik-gaeng-recipe-%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B3-%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%81%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%9C%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%81%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%81/) which is a stir-fry curry chicken recipe.  \n\nI'm not an expert, but in terms of nomenclature, I think it would still be appropriate to call it a curry soup...or even curry broth :)",

                                    "comment": "I get that! But just in defense of the recipe, I would lightly advise against it, personally. The meatballs fry in the pan that later cooks up the broth, so there isn\u2019t an extra pan. It builds up a layer of flavor that I think would be missing if you throw them in the air fryer. The meatballs cook in the broth and develop a moistness and flavor from the green curry broth that you wouldn\u2019t get from the air fryer and adding them back in briefly at the end. Just my 2 cents. \n\n\nIf you love your airfryer, by all means go for it! Just like to explain the why of the recipe so people can decide what works best for them \ud83d\ude0a",

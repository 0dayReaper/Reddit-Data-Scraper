Higher parm-to-filling ratio and not nearly as messy. In addition to veggies, one could fill it with pesto chicken salad, a mediterranean tuna salad, etc.",

If the veggies fall, you can use a fork and eat the basket \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude02 Alternatively, you can eat the filling first with a fork and then break the cheese basket to enjoy its crispiness... that way, you can make sure they don't fall!",

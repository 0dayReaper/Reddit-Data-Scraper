I think it will still be good after thawed out.\n\nI do the same with guanciale and pancetta. I just but a big piece and cut them into portion. When I need, I just take out a portion.\n\nFor the ham, if you buy a large quantity, make sure to seperate into portions before freezing. then only use what you need.",

This is a recipe which was very popular in the '80 in Italy, when the use of heavy cream was a riot, but was probably present since the '50.\n\nIn substitution of dry pasta we often used tortellini or the so called \"paglia e fieno\" (literally \"straw and hay\"), i.e. tagliatelle or fettuccine in two colors, natural (yellow) and green (from spinach), mixed together.\n\nMain differences I can spot, we probably used a bit less onion, and we cooked the peas longer (crunchy vegetables were not very popular here).\n\nAt a certain point in time the use of heavy cream became taboo, but many of us are still using it, now and then, in the hidden recesses of our kitchens.",

After all, ham is popular in Italy and peas are probably very common, I think right now fresh peas are in season.\n\nThankyou for this, I would have never known. And it would have never came to my mind to even check if heavy cream was ever used in Italy, or at least popular in Italy.\n\nWhat was the reason heavy cream became taboo?",

                            "comment": "Yes in those years (I'm a guy from '64) heavy cream (\"panna\") was very popular. I don't know if it was a way to imitate French cousine or the effect of a second economic \"boom\" which made popular more opulent recipes. Possibly, in the eyes of  the bourgeoisie,  adding panna made everything taste more \"rich\" and \"chic\".\n\nSo pasta panna-prosciutto-piselli (your recipe) was very popular at home but also in restaurants, as well as penne alla vodka, and variations, like pasta with heavy cream and mushrooms or with heavy cream and speck (a kind of smoked prosciutto).\n\nAnother classic was pasta with smoked salmon and heavy cream. Still a favorite for one of my sons, while the other when he was a kid preferred pasta with a concoction made blending cream, smoked pancetta and tomato paste until smooth.\n\nIn the same period the \"filet with green pepper\" (and heavy cream) was another very common dish in restaurants.\n\nIt is unclear to me why there was a decline in the following years, at least in the media and in restaurants menus. I think popular chefs reacted to the ubiquitous heavy cream by declaring that was not fashionable anymore, that the cream dulled the flavors and so on, that it was just a way to cover errors and shortcomings (which may be partially true).\n\nI do not watch television, but I heard that there are popular cooking shows on TV in which now and then chefs and participants still stigmatize the use of heavy cream. Unfortunately people often uncritically repeat what the TV says.\n\nAnyway, h.cream it is still used, since all the supermarkets sell UHT heavy cream, which, contrary to fresh heavy cream (also sold) cannot be used to make whipped cream, so it is a sign the less \"chic\" of us still use it...\n\nAs an added curiousity about heavy cream (which maybe I've already pointed out, sorry), I noticed that on internet there are a lot of recipes called \"Tuscan soup\", or \"Tuscan chicken\" or even \"Tuscan salmon\" and  that all of them use cream.\n\nThis is rather unheard of here in Tuscany (so you will not find 'Tuscan salmon' in Pisa or Florence...) but it seems it derives from a successul dish (Zuppa toscana) from the chain Olive Garden that to make the soup more creamy did indeed add heavy cream (and curiously dry tomatoes). For some reason the name stuck, so now the recipes with cream and dry tomatoes and/or kale are called 'Tuscan', which I find a bit funny.",

Malta wasn't as popular as it is now.\n\nNow you wouldn't have any problem finding places to eat at any time of year.\n\nIn 1991, the capital city Valletta was a mess, nobody wanted to live there, the beatiful old buildings where all falling to pieces. In all that beauty it was one of the few places in malta nobody would imagine living in. You could buy a place for nothing or even get places given to you for free from the government,\n\nToday Valletta has been brought back to life and is beautiful and buzzing with life throught the day and even into the night. But its also become really expensive.\n\nCompared to 1991 when Malta was a sleepy little island, things have changed a lot. Lots of people are coming here. So there is a lot traffic, house prices keep going up each year (I bought an apartment in 2017, today I could sell for x2 what I paid)\n\nIts getting a little too much now here in Malta. Like many other places, over development and greed seem to be ruining everything.\n\nMaybe people that have never been here before and don't know what it was like, wouldn't have any problem. But for me that I grew up here and remember what it was like, I increasingly feel bad a bout the whole thing.\n\nIts still nice, but it is nothing like in 1991.",

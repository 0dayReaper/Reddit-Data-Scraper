The giant spinny makes it so that whenever a slice of meat is cut, it has a crunchy and flavorful *crust*. \n\n Making it like this in the oven will only get you a crust on the first cut of the meat, after that it'll just be soggy meat.   \n\n An alternative method is to just slice up the meat before hand and then bake it so that every slice has a nice crust on it. Plus, this looks like it's easy but I can say for 95% of you, this thing will keep calling over and you'll have to add some structural support to it. Much better to just use the alternative method",

                    "comment": "This isn't true, al pastor is a fusion of Labanese and Mexican cuisine that happened after migrants from Lebanon made their way to CDMX in the late 1800s. Cumin is undoubtably a spice used in middle eastern cuisine and was being used by the migrants when they made it to Mexico. \n\nThe spice made its way to Mexico by the Spanish who brought over in the 1500s. By the early to mid 1900's the \"trompo\" style cooking began to pop up everywhere in CDMX as well as the new innovation of tacos al pastor.  \n\nChefs Margarita Carrillo Arronte, Gonzalo Guzman, Luis Amado, and Gabriela C\u00e1mara all call for the spice to be added to their recipes. Other decorated chefs such as Enrique Olvera and Diane Kennedy add achiote paste which has cumin in it, just do a search and you will find almost all recipes for achiote have cumin as an ingredient. \n\nAll this history has been well documented by several organizations including the Culinary Institute of America, American Culinary Federation, and many Mexican chefs. \n\nYou are correct though about all Mexican dishes not needing it however also as a Mexican I'd like you to know that there are many dishes that utilize cumin, especially tacos, with that said you don't need to be Mexican to know how to cook Mexican food, and you also don't need to be Mexican to be an expert on it. \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recado\\_rojo#cite\\_note-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recado_rojo#cite_note-1)\n\n[https://www.eatyourbooks.com/library/recipes/1404536/shepherds-tacos-tacos-al-pastor](https://www.eatyourbooks.com/library/recipes/1404536/shepherds-tacos-tacos-al-pastor)\n\n[https://www.masterclass.com/articles/chef-gabriela-camaras-tacos-al-pastor-recipe#what-is-the-difference-between-carnitas-and-al-pastor](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/chef-gabriela-camaras-tacos-al-pastor-recipe#what-is-the-difference-between-carnitas-and-al-pastor)\n\n[https://patijinich.com/tacos-al-pastor/](https://patijinich.com/tacos-al-pastor/)\n\n[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/549125/pdf](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/549125/pdf)\n\n[https://www.acfchefs.org/ACFSource/Recipes/?id=809](https://www.acfchefs.org/ACFSource/Recipes/?id=809)\n\n[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33993719](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33993719)\n\n[https://www.foodgal.com/2017/08/give-it-up-for-nopalitos-tacos-de-pescado-al-pastor/](https://www.foodgal.com/2017/08/give-it-up-for-nopalitos-tacos-de-pescado-al-pastor/)\n\n[https://www.tasteatlas.com/tacos-al-pastor/comments](https://www.tasteatlas.com/tacos-al-pastor/comments)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al\\_pastor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_pastor)",

The vinegar and pineapple juice in the marinade are tasty, but the acidity helps break down and soften the fat. Then the spinning spit makes the outside crunchy.

Instead of putting the meat on a skewer and baking it, get your charcoal grill piping hot and grill each slice flat. You'll cook all of the meat much faster than in an oven, and there will be *tons* of charred/browned pieces of meat. It's the closest to getting that authentic taste without a rotisserie, and you don't have to wait hours for it.\n\nAnd on the plus side you can grill some pineapple, too. Chop it up (meat and pineapple), mix in a bowl, and spoon into individual tortillas.\n\nOn a slightly different note: always, always question giant slabs of meat that you see on a rotisserie. That's a food safety **nightmare**. The outside of the meat is usually cooked plenty hot enough, but the center bit can be ~80 degrees F for *hours*. Those things are supposed to be used within 4 hours, but they seldom are.",

If the giant spinning oven refers to the same thing as what a kebap is made on, then this method won't work (as many have said in the comments).\n\nIf you wanted to be a bit more serious about your kebap love, you can buy home-scale ovens for relatively cheap, around $100. I have [this one](https://www.alza.cz/EN/rohnson-r-2530-d5568845.htm) but I'm sure they will be available on Amazon and other stores as well.",

                            "comment": "Growing up I loved scotch eggs. Yolks were of course always hard-boiled though. And I generally ate them cold.\n\nThen one day about nine years ago I had my first ever warm scotch egg with a *runny* yolk. OMG! That yolk alone was enough for me to keep coming back to that restaurant and trying other things (almost always having a scotch egg starter). And being served warm was way better too.\n\nSo I figured out how to make them like that, and started serving them pretty much whenever we had guests that I hadn\u2019t made them for before. For a few years literally everybody I made them for was visibly amazed when they cut into it and unexpectedly found a runny yolk. Every single person asked \u201cHow did you do that? Was that on purpose? OMG can I have the recipe?\u201d\n\nBut now if I get served a scotch egg, my first thought is \u201cThis better have a runny yolk\u201d. If it doesn\u2019t, I am so disappointed and my opinion of the restaurant/chef plummets. If I make them for somebody, the first thing they say is \u201cLooks good, but does it have a runny yolk?\u201d.\n\nThere was a time in my life when a warm scotch egg with a runny yolk was something worth living for. But the novelty has worn off and the cold harsh reality is that the introduction of the runny yolk, coupled with serving them warm, was a real game-changer that ushered in a new standard and essentially ruined one of my favourite snacks / picnic items, because I can no longer buy them at the supermarket without simply feeling disappointed when I eat them. Now when I want a scotch egg I have to take the time to make it myself (not as easy as before I had kids), or go out to a pricey restaurant. So I eat a lot less scotch eggs. On the plus side I\u2019ve lost a lot of weight though, and that\u2019s allowed me to start enjoying some of the other things life has to offer. So I guess it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag.",

Then turn on heat and bring to a boil, then immediately turn heat off.  Now leave them covered for another 4 minutes and 30 seconds or so and then try one. You cut it in half and put a little butter and salt on then scoop it out with a spoon (soft boiled egg). Delicious. Once you see they are the right level of cooked, drop the rest in the ice bath. Usually 4:30 to 5:00 is perfect depending on a few factors like how much water you use, it\u2019s temperature, and how high above sea level you are (affects boiling point). \n\nBoiling the whole time over cooks the egg and makes it taste and smell like sulfur. Dropping a cold egg into boiling water makes them very likely to crack and explode. The bring to a boil and turn off the heat method results in the best possible soft texture.

            "comment": "**Scotch eggs** are boiled eggs wrapped in sausage, breaded, and fried. They can be had hot or cold.  \n\nSource: [Recipe 30](http://www.recipe30.com/scotch-eggs-with-italian-sausage.html/)\n\n10 eggs (2 for egg wash) \n\n1lb -500g Italian sausages (approx 4 large ones) \n\nHalf bunch of flat leaf (Italian) parsley \n\n1 tbsp Dijon mustard \n\n\u00bd cup all purpose (plain) flour \n\n1 cup breadcrumbs \n\n2 quarts - 2 litres of vegetable oil for frying\n\n\nIn a large pot, add water and bring to the boil. Ideally you want approx one inch (2cm) of water above your eggs. (Put as many eggs as you like but do not overlap)\n\nUsing a spoon, carefully lower the eggs, cold from the fridge, one at a time into the pot and continue to boil for 30 seconds. Cover using a lid then turn down the heat to a very gentle simmer and continue cooking for 5-6 minutes for runny yolks. If you have jumbo size eggs leave an extra minute or two. If you prefer hard, cook for 11 minutes.\n\nWhile the eggs are cooking, get a bowl or mixing bowl three quarters full of cold tap water. Then add some ice.\n\nOnce cooked, immediately place all the eggs in the ice water and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes. Peel off the egg shells under cool running water.\n\nScore the sausages by running your knife lengthwise on the top to split them open. Scoop out all the meat and place in a mixing bowl.\n\nChop the washed parsley and add to the sausage meat along with a tablespoon of Dijon mustard. Mix well by hand.\nRoll out a sheet of cling film on your bench and scoop out one heaped tablespoon of the sausage mixture. Place on the cling film and fold cling film over to sandwich the meat. Gently flatten it with your hand then finish it with a rolling pin to get an even thickness. You don\u2019t want it too thick, a thin to medium coat gives better results. \n\nOil your hands, then pick up the plastic unwrap the meat, place the meat in the palm of your hand as you peel away the plastic. You should have only the flatten meat patty, now coat one of the boiled eggs in flour and place inside the sausage meat. Fold meat over the egg and wrap the egg so no white is showing. Any thick bits of sausage meat, tear them off and put back in bowl. Repeat process for all the eggs. Refrigerate 15-30 minutes.\n\nHeat up your deep frying oil to 350\u00b0F \u2013 180\u00b0C.\nFor the egg wash, break two whole eggs in a bowl and mix well using a fork. \nSet up a crumbing station with one plate of flour and one plate with the breadcrumbs. \nRoll the prepared eggs in the flour first, then the egg wash, then the breadcrumbs. Only one coat is required. \nCarefully lower into the hot oil and fry fro approx 4 minutes. Generally if they are brown, they are ready.\n\n**Notes**: I\u2019ve only made Scotch eggs a few times so I\u2019m sure there will be useful feedback in the comments from people who are super Scotch egg savvy! While the creator of this content says to use fresh eggs, I have the best luck peeling eggs that are a little older (a week or two old) because they just seem to peel cleaner. For the cooking oil, vegetable works fine but my preferred oil is peanut oil. \n\nIf anyone is interested, I made a version of a Scotch egg wrapped in shrimp instead of sausage, and it was damn delicious.

If the egg breaks it'll lose structure and it's possible the sausagemeat won't be cooked properly in the middle before it gets too dark. They're always hardboiled eggs in the UK anyway, and eaten cold, unless you get them from a fancy restraunt.\n\nThe mustard in this recipe is not traditional, usually it's just plain sausagemeat, but it'd be interesting to try.\n\nFun fact: while no-one is quite sure why this is called a scotch egg, we do know it has nothing to do with Scotland!",

This makes the shell easy to break open with your thumb, and then the shell can be pulled off in only a couple large pieces, no need to pulverize the whole thing.\n\nSuper easy, don't need to waste a ton of water, plus the nicer steamers have auto-off so if you aren't paying close attention you don't ruin a half dozen eggs.",

I'd mush it up a bunch in the bowl, so that the fat warms up just a little, and emulsifies the mixture. You don't want it sweaty, just very well mixed. If it gets sweaty, stick it in the fridge. \n\n\n\nWe weigh the sausage out to 3oz per egg. Also, you can weigh out, or free form the sausage while your eggs cook. I like to make them into little patties when I weigh them out, to make the wrapping part easier. \n\n\n\nI like to start the eggs in cool water with a pinch of baking soda. Bring to a boil, let go for maybe 2min, turn off the flame, and let them sit in the water for maybe 6-8 minutes, then drain and dump a bunch of ice on. This is for runny centered eggs. If you want harder bois, boil for five, and let sit for 8 in the pot.\n\n\nPeel those guys while they're still cold, in the ice. The shell should slip off without too much effort, there are always a couple of trouble makers though. If you go runny yolk, the eggs are gonna be real squishy, and easily broken, and you're gonna be really glad that you emulsified that sausage. It will be much easier to handle. (Yeah, I know). Also drying off your eggs before wrapping w/the meat will help so, so much. \n\nTake a moment to mix up some flour, salt, and pepper, in a bowl or whatever vessel you have clean. I also get my oil heating at this stage, a couple of inches, maybe 350F. \n\nTake one of your little meat patties in your hand, and gently nestle an egg in there. Still, gently, begin to work the sausage around the egg, until it's surrounded. Try not to smush the eggs. Dust them in the seasoned flour. Bread them like many other fried foods, egg and bread crumbs. \nDon't coat the eggs in flour before sausage-ing them. I've done it, and it makes the wrapping process easier by a mile, but when you cut into the finished scotch egg, the egg wants to pop out of its cozy sausage home. If you're only making a few though, do it. It's a disaster for plating when you're chasing egg whites and sausage all over the plate during service, though.  \n\n\nDrop them in the hot oil enough to brown, and how we do it, since it's in batches, we crisp em up in the oil, then bake them for like 10 min at 350-375 F, until the sausage is cooked. \n\n\n\nThen we keep 'em cold till ordered. \n\nTo serve, they're quartered and heated at 475F for 5 min, and served with honey mustard.\n\n\n\nEdit: Lots of edits. Lots and lots.",

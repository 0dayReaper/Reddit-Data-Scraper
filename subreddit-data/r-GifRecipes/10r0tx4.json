I also post all my vegan recipes on [**Exploring Vegan**](https://exploringvegan.com/) if you're interested in more plant-based dishes.\n\nThis is a really simple side dish that goes great with anything. If not vegan, use dairy-based butter. I used vegan butter made from beans!\n\nThis was supposed to be my side dish to my first roasted chicken yesterday, but I completely fucked up the chicken, so I ended up just eating this for dinner instead, lol. It would go great with your favorite meat or plant-based protein. Or you could stir in a can of chickpeas before simmering for an easy one-pot meal.\n\nSome people like to cook mushrooms in a dry pot, but I like cooking them in a little extra virgin olive oil. You can do whatever works for you!\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more if needed\n* 12 ounces baby Bella mushrooms, wiped clean and sliced\n* 1 shallot, peeled and diced\n* 3 tablespoons plant-based butter\n* 1 cup pearl couscous\n* 3 sprigs thyme\n* 1\u00bd cups water or vegetable broth\n* 2 tablespoons freshly minced parsley\n* 1 lemon, juiced\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n**Brown the mushrooms:**\n\n1. Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the mushrooms in batches if needed, and cook, occasionally stirring, for 8-10 minutes until the mushrooms release liquid and that liquid evaporates. Don\u2019t remove them from the pot until they\u2019re nice and golden brown! Season all over with salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl.\n\n**Saut\u00e9 the shallot:**\n\n1. Add another teaspoon of oil to the pot if needed. Add the shallot and cook for 1-2 minutes. Melt the butter into the shallot and saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes.\n\n**Toast the couscous:**\n\n1. Add the pearl couscous and toast for 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Simmer the couscous:**\n\n1. Return the mushrooms to the pot along with the thyme. Add the water and bring it to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes or until couscous is tender.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Stir in the lemon juice and fresh parsley. Taste and season once more. Enjoy with your favorite plant-based protein.",

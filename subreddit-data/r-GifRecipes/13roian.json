            "comment": "Hello! Hi everyone, Wesley here. Today we're diving back into our series dedicated to Chinese dim sum classics with a shot at a Chinese \"sticky fried rice,\" or glutinous fried rice. As the name implies, our dish today will be a fairly straight forward fried rice, which is to say, a wok stir fry featuring rice cooked directly in the wok with a handful of veggies and proteins. Our fried rice today however will have one unique addition, which is gonna be the inclusion of some glutinous sticky rice. For those unfamiliar, glutinous rice (or sometimes, sticky rice and/or sweet rice) while may appear to look like any other rice in its raw form, in fact has a much higher content of amylopectin starch than your more common jasmine or long grain rice, resulting in a \"sticky\" and tacky texture to its cooked form (as a sidenote, it does not contain any gluten, misleading as that might be). \n\nThough glutinous rice has a variety of uses all throughout Chinese cuisine (Some may recall the sticky rice \"zhongzi\" dumplings that we did not too long ago), the sticky fried rice that we're making today is popularly found as a small plate dish on dim sum carts for those seeking Chinese breakfast and/or brunch time snacks, which makes it a wonderful addition to the now growing list of dim sum recipes on this channel. Hope you try it.

I occasionally use a wok ring to stabilize the wok when I use it for things like deep frying or slow braising (it\u2019s basically just a metal wring to hold the wok in place). I personally prefer to leave it off for stir frying cause I like to be able to move the wok around more easily. I\u2019ve definitely had it roll off the stove on accident at least a few times though, haha. \n\nI went into a bit more detail about this In the [wok cooking basics](https://youtu.be/7w8JEjsvbjA) video from a while back too, if ur interested \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

This should keep it from burning, although you do need to work quickly tho, so mise en place is really important. \n\nThe benefit to adding it early though is that the aromatic and fragrant qualities of the garlic will release when in contact with the wok surface, while the wok is empty.

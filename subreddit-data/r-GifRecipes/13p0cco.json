            "comment": "hello! Hi everyone, Wesley here. Today we\u2019re diving back into our series dedicated to TV and film with yet another addition to our growing collection of fried chicken recipes inspired by the Korean soy garlic fried chicken from All of us are Dead. As you might have noticed, our soon-to-be zombie high school kids are eating two different types of Korean fried chicken (or colloquially, \u201cKFC\u201d), both of which are very popular in Korea as well as here in the states. The first more bright red plate is a \u201cyang nyeum\u201d chicken iconically glazed with a korean gochujang chili paste, and for those looking, we did a version of this dish on the channel a few months back, here. \n\nSo! This means that for our attempts today, we\u2019ll be looking at this second plate of chicken, which is an equally popular \u201cdakgangjeong,\u201d or soy garlic fried chicken. For those unfamiliar, dakgangjeong is a korean sweet and savory fried chicken that employs the use of soy sauce, garlic, and honey to create its simultaneously sticky, sweet, and savory qualities. To pair with this, we\u2019ll also be using one of my favorite dry batters that makes use of corn starch, potato starch and baking soda to create the iconically extra crispy fried chicken wings that KFC is known for. Hope you try it.

I think the two different starches is optional, but they definitely yield different textures though. Potato starch gives more of a craggily texture (its most iconically used in chicken karaage, which is a good point of reference), while corn starch is mostly just a super thin starch. So cutting the potato starch with a little corn starch keeps it from becoming overly bready, but if u want a REALLY craggily fried chicken, just use potato starch! Let me know if u try this one \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffd",

The splattering has a lot to do with how much water is in whatever ur frying (so, I have that problem the most with things like tofu, or even chicken thigh out of the freezer). Drying out the ingredients as much as possible will reduce splattering, but some amount will inevitably happen just because there\u2019s bound to be some liquid left behind. Good luck!",

The idea with a double fry is to burn off as much moisture as possible in the first try, which allows the fryer to stay more consistently hotter in the 2nd fry, yielding a crispier piece of chicken. \n\nI think by rigid standards, the double fry is more or less a requirement for Korean fried chicken, but personally, I also find that you can get away with skipping the double fry for dryer batters like this one (particularly since a double fry takes a bit longer, since u have to spend so much time removing and cooling each batch). \n\nLet me know if u try this one!",

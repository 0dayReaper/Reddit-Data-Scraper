You basically wash all the starch out leaving the protein. \n\nThere are some good recipes on YouTube for seitan hams. You can flavour it in different ways and give it different textures. I haven't come across any recently, but my ex was Vietnamese and the temple try went to sold all sorts of seitan based meat substitutes",

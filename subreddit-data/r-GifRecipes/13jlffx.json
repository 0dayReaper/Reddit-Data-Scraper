Place the pancetta in a cold skillet or wide pot and turn the heat to medium. Cook, turning occasionally, for 5\u20136 minutes or until the fat renders completely and the pancetta is crispy.\n2. Using a slotted spoon, transfer a heaping tablespoon to a small bowl and reserve for garnish. Transfer the remaining pancetta to a large bowl.\n\n**Cook the chicken:**\n\n1. Return the heat on the skillet to medium. Add the ground chicken and cook it in the pancetta fat for 12\u201315 minutes, breaking it up as it cooks. Season with salt, pepper, 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning, and garlic powder. Add a pinch of crushed red pepper to taste. Cook for an additional 3 minutes. Transfer the cooked chicken to the large bowl with the pancetta.\n\n**Boil the pasta:**\n\n1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and cook the pasta for 3 minutes under al dente. Remove \u00bd cup pasta cooking water from the pot before draining the pasta.\n2. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425\u00baF.\n\n**Prepare the sauce:**\n\n1. In the same skillet used to cook the chicken, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the onion and saut\u00e9 for 5\u20137 minutes, turning often, until translucent and softened.\n2. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n3. Pour in the beans and season with the remaining 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning and \u00bd teaspoon of crushed red pepper. Add the cooked chicken and pancetta\n4. Pour in the pasta cooking water and the heavy cream. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.\n\n**Finish the pasta:**\n\n1. Add the cooked pasta to the pot and toss to coat. Spread into an even layer in the skillet. Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese on top of the pasta and scatter the pancetta you reserved for garnish on top.\n2. Transfer to the oven for 15 minutes until the cheese is bubbly. If you like, turn on the broiler and broil for 2 minutes for extra browned bubbly spots on top.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Remove the skillet from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes. Serve with fresh basil leaves on top if you like. Enjoy!",

You're right that beans aren't all protein, but they have more protein than pasta (more than regular old pasta, not pasta made from lentils etc). This is a nice way to offset the carbs in pasta while introducing healthy plant-based fiber/protein that wouldn't exist if you made it with just pasta.",

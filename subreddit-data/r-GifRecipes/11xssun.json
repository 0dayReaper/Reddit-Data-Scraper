Gather the chipotles with their sauce in a large bowl with maple syrup and lime juice. Whisk to combine. Add the chicken and season all over with salt, chili powder, garlic powder, and cayenne powder. Toss to coat and marinate for 1 hour up to 24 hours.\n\n**Prepare the slaw:**\n\n1. While the chicken marinates, prepare the slaw. Combine vinegar, maple syrup, and mayonnaise in a bowl and whisk until completely smooth. Add a few splashes of hot sauce.\n2. In a bowl, combine the Brussels sprouts, jalape\u00f1o, and cilantro and toss to combine. Add a big pinch of salt. Pour the dressing on top. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.\n\n**Cook the chicken:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon of neutral oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to soften. Turn the heat to high. Arrange the chicken in the skillet with the onion. Spoon any extra marinade on top of each chicken thigh. Cook for 5\u20136 minutes until it begins to char slightly.\n2. Flip the chicken and add the black beans, tomatoes, and water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 40\u201350 minutes. Season with salt and pepper if needed.\n3. Once the chicken is completely cooked through, shred each thigh with two forks. Toss to coat in the sauce and cook for 5 minutes more. Taste and season. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide cooked white rice between bowls. Spoon the chicken on top and serve with the slaw. Garnish each plate with radishes, and avocado. Serve with a lime wedge. Enjoy!",

Chicken thighs hold up well to longer cooking time so you\u2019re not at risk for over cooking them especially since they\u2019ll be shredded anyway.",

Always salt the meat directly. Yes, add salt to the breading, but you don\u2019t want to have bland chicken underneath. Just salt is fine, even if you have fancy spices in breading.\n\n2. Don\u2019t add anything to the egg wash. Just beat some eggs in a bowl large enough to put whole piece of chicken in.\n\n3.  Start your oil hot (350-375 F) to get your crust crisping, but drop it to about 325 for the real cook.  That way, you have crispy crust, but tender juicy chicken.\n\n4. If you\u2019re pan frying instead of deep frying, use cast iron if you have it. Otherwise, a pan that feels heavier than it looks.  Reason being, the extra mass gives you extra THERMAL mass, which gives you more control of the heat of your oil when frying.\n\n5.  Don\u2019t over stuff your cooking device! That\u2019s how you get either soggy or undercooked chicken. All your pieces should have room to stretch out without bothering the others.\n\n6. Don\u2019t put your lovingly, deliciously fried chicken on paper towels.  Instead, put a cookie cooling rack on top of a sheet pan (I put foil in between for ease of cleaning) so as not to ruin all your crispy work.",

This will change your fried chicken so hard. 1/4 cup pickle juice per pound of chicken breast or boneless chicken thighs does a wonder. You can do a second \"marinade\" with these ingredients if you want, but I really think that a pickle juice brine does better to prep your meat for dredging and frying than buttermilk does. You could easilly add the fresh ground pepper and cayenne to the mix and have better flavor results than the marinade in this recipe.\n\nIf you're going with a spicy mix you can buy jarred jalapenos and use the brine from the jar instead. I use jalapenos a lot so I have leftover easy-brine which is really just jalapeno pickle juice. I use the jalapeno brine for my spicy fried chicken sandwiches and add some chipotle or ancho seasonings in the breading. I think this works the best.",

                                    "comment": "Many times \"deep frying\" can be done by using more than just a coating in a heavy cast iron. The deep part of frying just has to encompass the food enough to encompass it in oil, and honestly in fried chicken sandwiches as long as the meat isn't excessively large or you pound a filet flat you can do it in open frying.\n\nFried chicken sandwiches I find a solid 1/2\" deep fry is good enough and it's not an unreasonable amount of oil to fry half of a chicken breast while the other half is (relatively) uncovered. If you are using chicken breast you should be flattening it out (not cutting) to thin it out. Corn oil tends to be tolerant of higher temperatures enough to be used as a fry oil, I use it as a peanut oil substitute for super high temp Wok cooking and have no adverse issues. I fry potatoes and fries in a 6 quart cast iron in corn oil as well, mostly because I have a friend highly allergic to peanuts so I use the next best thing.\n\nYou can't fry in nonsticks, it has to be stainless steel or cast iron, but honestly it's not that much more money to invest in the tools and they're universal. I only recommend if frying in shallow pans you invest and understand every way to handle a grease fire at the first signs, and don't be afraid if they happen. Grease fires are only common if you don't follow practices standard to frying in pans. If you overfill your oil and get it too hot then drop chicken in and it overflows you get an immediate overflow and grease fire. Rarely do they happen from splashes otherwise, but the deeper the pan the less chance you have.\n\nShallow frying is the fastest ways to grease fires but is still not common so just being ready is the best thing you could do if using a shallow cast iron. You will feel more comfortable if one does occur, you can put it out immediately if you just don't immediately run or try to reach for water (NEVER USE WATER ON GREASE OR OIL FIRES). Small grease fires can be managed by pouring baking soda or salt directly on a grease fire, but if you can turn the heat source off first, do it immediately. Keeping baking soda or an available container of salt next to your frying zone within reach is an emergency method that you can always use. A class B extinguisher should always be kept in a kitchen anyways but is more important when frying since it's a dry chemical extinguisher. A cheap ABC extinguisher is under $20 and can save you from anything that could be considered \"risky\" but are common methods of cooking that use oil in the kitchen.",

The next day I wore the same jeans and on the way into work I realized my jeans smelled STRONGLY of oil. Like, if you walked within 5 feet of me all you could smell was oil. It was so bad I stopped and bought new pants before my morning meeting, and the smell STILL lingered on my skin/underwear from briefly wearing those pants. Ugh",

Look on Craigslist or whatever for a turkey deep fryer or if you can find it, the burner base that you connect the propane too. Used ones are pretty cheap I got mine with all turkey stuff for $40 and I put a high flow valve on it,l. could probably get to the moon with this rocket. You now have a heat source to use a pot or skillet to fry your food outside and not get grease, mess, and that smell in your place. I\u2019ve yet to do a turkey but I did a chicken and it was good. Even good for just cooking stuff outside since it\u2019s stronger then a grill.",

The function of buttermilk on fried chicken isn't to impart flavour, it's to tenderise the chicken due to its acidity. You can fake this effect by grabbing milk (even dairy-free milks), and adding lemon juice or vinegar.",

I agree that you do not want to turn early, but I have flipped several times, and still get a crispy sandwich.  so even if you're an amateur, just wait until you have a super dark golden crust before you flip, and if you mess up it's not a big deal that you can flip it again.

On my gas oven, I use about a five out of 9 in heat settings.  If you are unsure, cut a tiny chunk off, and fry it by itself to get an idea of how long it will take to get a crust.  I usually go about 4:00 or 5 minutes per side, but I'm pretty sure most recipes say about 3 minutes. while you are still perfecting this technique, I feel it is way better to overcook than under cook.  You can overcook by a minute or two, and still have an awesome Sammy but if you under cook, it could be soggy or raw.\n\nAlso, I highly recommend adding panko to the breading mix.",

It's not as good as deep frying them since the breading gets soggy, it's also the same way with attempting to get the same texture/crispness of fried chicken by baking them. If you're worried about the healthiness of oil, I'd recommend going with some lighter oils or even just straining dirty oil out after you're done.",

Coriander seeds are from the same plant and you really get more of the citrus flavor with them. That's why cilantro is more often than not paired with lime or other things that use citrus undertones.

I'll have to get it from her when she gets back from vacation.\n\n-----\n\nEDIT: RECIPE!\n\n**CHEESY VEGETABLE SOUP**\n\nServings: 23 (3/4 cup = 1 serving)\n\n*Notes: My mom usually uses frozen/canned vegetables because they require less prep time, and she works. But, you could just as easily use fresh vegetables; they'll just need to cook longer. I will usually double the amount of garlic, black pepper and crushed red pepper that my mom uses, and I'll often add 1-2 tsp of cayenne powder as well. But that's just me. The recipe below is the way she makes it.*\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* 2 lbs. Birds Eye California Blend Frozen Vegetables (carrots, broccoli, cauliflower)\n* 3/4 cup onion, chopped\n* 2 tsp garlic, minced\n* 2 - 4.66 oz. tubs Knorr Homestyle Chicken Stock\n* 10 oz. 2% Milk Velveeta\n* 1 - 8 oz. can original cut green beans\n* 1 - 10 oz. can RO-TEL Original Diced Tomatoes &amp; Green Chilies\n* 3/4 tsp salt\n* 3/4 tsp black pepper\n* 1 Tbsp parsley, dried\n* 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper\n* Water\n\n**PREPARATION**\n\n1. Bring frozen vegetables and 4 cups of water to a boil in a large, uncovered soup pot.\n2. Once the water reaches a boil, turn the heat down and let it simmer for 25-30 minutes.\n3. Remove one-third of the vegetables from the pot and puree them in a blender before returning them to the pot. This helps thicken the soup and provides a smoother texture.\n4. Add chopped onion, minced garlic, chicken stock, Velveeta, salt, black pepper, parsley and crushed red pepper. You can substitute chicken bouillon cubes for the chicken stock, but you'll want to dissolve the cubes in water (1 cup per cube) before adding them to the pot.\n5. Add 2 more cups of water to prevent the soup from becoming too thick.\n6. Add canned green beans and tomatoes with chilies.\n7. Let everything simmer together for at least another 15-20 minutes before serving. The longer it simmers, the more the flavors will develop. If it needs more flavor, consider adding more stock or bouillon. (My mom said she doesn't usually have to do that, but she's done it before.)\n8. Enjoy! We often serve it with salad or rotisserie chicken, but it also can be a meal on its own.\n\n*More notes: You can always add more Velveeta for extra cheesiness. The soup keeps for at least a week in the fridge, and I'm sure it would freeze well (though I haven't tried). If you do Weight Watchers, this recipe works out to 1 SP per 3/4 cup serving.*",

The byproduct is gas because our large intestine is the place where the sugar finally gets eaten by the bacteria. You can have special bacteria break it down, (Like in Beano), which causes your body to absorb it earlier in the digestion process, but it spikes your blood sugar more. Has little to do with veganism I think. ",

They use laurus nobilis in many dishes and it has a very distinct taste that will be noticed - even if you don't know that they used it. We certainly had guests asking what \"that taste is\". \n\nWe also did a few tests because I'm a nerd and love chemistry so we cooked dishes with and without bay leaf. Blind testing the food we were able to tell the difference.\n\n\nShelf life is roughly one year at room temperature and normal humidity levels - so maybe your supply doesn't taste that intensely because of wrong storage?\n\nPeople claim it is similar to oregano or thyme (the wiki states this as well), but you can taste a difference when doing a comparison as well. \n\nHowever, if certain other spices are used that are more intense this can impact the intensity, so that could be another reason why you don't notice it.",

For example, I would put a more dry pico on nachos and change the fresh jalapeno for pickled jalapeno (you know those cans with Chiles en vinagre) and also on a hotdog with a lot less lemon juice. And I would use a juicer pico with a steak.\n\nSorry I didn't mean to sound like a snob. It was all in good intention for you to try with other tomatoes.\n\nGreetings from Acapulco.",

When you drain the mix, I taste for saltiness, but usually I find I can just dump it in without the need to add more salt to the mix.",

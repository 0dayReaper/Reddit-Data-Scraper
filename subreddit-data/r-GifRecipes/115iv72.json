This applies to ALL people:\n\n`Eat 2 to 3 servings a week`\n\n`from the \u201cBest Choices\u201d list`\n\n`(OR 1 serving from the \u201cGood Choices\u201d list)`\n\nYes, that means as a healthy adult, you should still only eat one serving of albacore tuna PER WEEK, and once you do, you've likely hit the \"safe\" mercury allotment for the week and everything else on that list, even the stuff in the \"good\" category, should be avoided.  And this is of course if you trust the levels dictated by the government as safe; that's a personal choice of course.\n\nThat's the max you should eat on a regular basis.  Eating from the \"choices to avoid\" is NEVER a good idea, but if you do it, you do it at your own risk (just like smoking or drinking alcohol).  The fish in the choices to avoid section are apex predators for their ecosystem.  The mercury levels they accrue isn't just a tiny bit more per ounce, it's SIGNIFICANTLY more.  See the chart here:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury\\_in\\_fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_in_fish)\n\nSwordfish is absolutely one of the worst offenders having 3x+ the amount of mercury compared to many other options considered bad, and over 50x higher than many of the \"good\" options like squid, shrimp, catfish, or tilapia.  And that's saying \"a whole swordfish has more than a whole shrimp\", that's parts per million (PPM) of the edible flesh, as in, comparing an ounce of one meat an ounce of another.  A huge steak like the one above could compete with the amount of mercury you might accrue from eating shrimp for a whole year for an avid shrimp eater.\n\nOf course, eat at your own risk.  Mercury never really leaves your body once you have it, and the nervous system affects are really unpleasant.  You do you.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury\\_poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_poisoning)",

Unfortunately I wasn't able to find guidance from the FDA on safe mercury consumption levels for people over 12, and/ or people not getting pregnant. \n\nI did find guidance from the NHS recommending only one portion a week if you aren't pregnant and are over 11. \n\nI also found an article from WEBMD saying the benefits of having swordfish outweigh the risks or mercury.",

From what I know, because my dad is a fisherman and used to make it, it is tuna that has been left to cure in sea salt and then put into oil.\n\nIt has a strong pungent smell similar to the fish sauce that is commonly used in many asian dishes.\n\nI think that in the recipe or ingredients sections on the website I mentioned to use anchovies or a table spoon of fish sauce instead of the smelly tuna thing which probably you won't find.\n\nI can't access my website to very these things are in the recipe. I'm facing some technical issues which have been going on for almost 24 hours. But I think if you're in the US it seems you won't have any problem visiting the site.",

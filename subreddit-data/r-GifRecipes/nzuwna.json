Combine warm milk, honey, and yeast. Let it bloom, or get bubbly, takes around 5-10 minutes. \\*Although blooming is not necessary for Instant Yeast\\*\n2. After blooming, add sifted flour, nutmeg, and eggs. Combine on medium speed for 8 minutes.\n3. Add half of the soft butter, combine, then add the rest and combine as well \\~5 minutes.\n4. Butter or oil a clean bowl and add the dough in. Cover with saran wrap and leave somewhere warm for an hour.\n5. After an hour, place on a floured surface and smack the big pockets of air gently out of the dough by turning and patting.\n6. Divide dough into 6, and roll into a ball. Cover the dough and let it rest for another \\~30 minutes, and do a poke test to see if it's ready.\n7. Heat up oil to 350F-375F and fry the doughnuts, 2 minutes per side. Remove from oil and roll in sugar while still warm.\n8. Whip heavy cream, maple syrup, and salt until stiff.\n9. Wait for the doughnuts to cool before adding the cream! If you do it while still hot it will melt off!\n10. Share with loved ones and ENJOY :)!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT\\*\\*\n\nPoke test (step 6) means when you poke it, your dough should spring back 75\\~80% of the way! If your dough does not spring back at all- you've overproofed it and you'll get a bad donut that will absorb too much oil. If your dough springs back all the way, it's not done proofing! Leave it alone and check on it every 10 mins after the 30 minute mark",

Some people believe that a long, slow rise for certain types of yeasted bread produces a better flavour or texture but I think for something sweet like this it won't make a big difference. I just do it because if I make them in the afternoon, then by the next day they're already starting to get stale. So I'd rather do most of the work one day and then fry them early the next day so I can eat them/give them away the same day.",

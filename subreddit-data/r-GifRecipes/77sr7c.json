I don't have it and would usually have to buy a bunch.\n\nFor instance, when I make Dacquoise, the recipe I have calls for mixing in instant coffee into amaretto. I just buy a small amount of ground espresso and soak the grounds in the amaretto for a couple of hours while I wait for other parts of the process to finish cooking/cooling. Works great. And I just need to buy like an ounce of espresso from my grocery store. Sometimes it's such a small amount, they don't even charge me. ",

Mine comes out a bit less smooth than that, but absolutely amazing. It's my show-stopper, if you will.\n\nI got my recipe from America's Test Kitchen. They charge money for most of their recipes and stuff, but Netflix had this episode for awhile, and I decided to transcribe this recipe into paper for myself so I can make it whenever I want, even if they take down the episode. Which I just checked, and yeah they took down the episode :(\n\nI'm getting ready to make a massive post about this big bake sale I was a part of. I'm sure people will ask for the Dacquoise recipe there as well, so I better clean it up so someone OTHER than myself can understand it. I've made it so many times now, some of the instructions are incomplete cause I simply know the steps by heart.",

I will flush out the recipe details so you can make it at home. And when I post, please ask my questions about any of the steps. It's a tricky recipe. It involves using a bread knife to gently square-off a meringue sheet. Not meringue cookies. Imagine all the fragility of a meringue cookie, but you have to make straight edged cuts on it. It takes some practice and patience.\n\nAnd of course covering the whole thing in chocolate when you're done building it is kinda frustrating delicate work. But you get used to it. And better at it. \n\nAnd the praise is totally worth the effort. I haven't met a single person that's even HEARD of this dessert. I've never seen it for sale in the states in any bakery, and I've been looking for years. It has new weird textures that most people have never experienced. And it just looks so stunning when you're done. When I finished my first one, I thought I'd never make another one because it was so much work. But then I saw the reactions of my guests. Now I make it every holiday I can.",

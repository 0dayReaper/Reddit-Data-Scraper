            "comment": "Hello hi everyone! Wesley here. Today we\u2019re diving back into our series dedicated to Chinese comfort food classics with yet another addition to our ever growing collection of fried rice recipes, with my very best shot at one of these golden fried rices that have been floating around the internet. For those not familiar, a golden fried rice is (like pretty much any other fried rice), a medley of veggies and proteins tossed together in a wok using dried leftover rice to yield the pebbly, grainy, wonderful rice texture that we all know and love in our fried rice. \n\nToday we\u2019re going to be making ours using some Chinese lap cheong sausage and baby bok choy. Our golden fried rice today however has one unique addition, where in the eggs that we would traditionally scramble before tossing into the rice will instead be stripped down to their yolks, then mixed off heat to coat our rice, yielding the dish\u2019s gorgeous golden color. Then to round this all out, we\u2019re also going to assemble a light acid-forward sauce element to pair with our rice which (if done correctly) won\u2019t bias the color of our golden hue too much here. Hope you try it. [**Follow the full video on youtube**](https://youtu.be/RVLR7u7-9WM) for the whole story too!\n\n**Woo Can Cook** is a series where we reproduce fun foods and recipes from my childhood. Some of them are authentically Chinese and/or pan-Asian, but a lot of them are odd Americanized versions that I inherited from my parents and grandparents while growing up in the Bay Area/California.\n\n**Homebase** (Recipes, Livestream Schedule, Music and more): [Woo Can Cook](https://WooCanCook.com)\n\n**Recipes**: [Woo Can Cook (Youtube)](https://youtube.com/woocancook?sub_confirmation=1)\n\n**Music**: [Woo Cooks Beats (Lofi Beats to Cook to)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcAGI6NAZV4&amp;list=PL72dM3fKnbHupDC0cIOHxaHBvjZLY3TdT&amp;index=9)\n\n**Woo Can Cook Fried Rice Pop Up (Every Thurs-Sun @ Wondrous Brewing!)**: https://WooCanCook.com/eats\n\n**TikTok** (short recipes and Woo Cooks Beats): [Woo Can Cook](https://www.tiktok.com/@woocancook)\n\n**Instagram** (pop-up schedule, music, and random Taki cameos): [@woocancook](https://instagram.com/WooCanCook)\n\n**RECIPE**\nhttps://woocancook.com/golden-fried-rice\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n- 4 cloves garlic\n- 1 inch (about 1 tbsp) ginger\n- 3 green onions\n- 4-6 oz baby bok choy\n- 5 lap cheong sausages\n- 3 egg yolks \n- 2 cups leftover rice\n- 1 tsp turmeric\n- peanut oil\n\n**INGREDIENTS (sauce)**\n- 4 tbsp low sodium soy sauce (or 2 tbsp full sodium soy sauce)\n- 1 tbsp sesame oil\n- 2 tbsp shaoxing wine\n- 1 tbsp hoisin sauce\n- 2 tbsp chili crisp oil\n\n**PREP**\n- CRUSH and mince the garlic, set aside\n- FINE MINCE the ginger, set aside\n- SEPARATE the whites and greens of the green onions, then slice thinly, set aside\n- SLICE the bok choy into quarters, set aside\n- DICE the lap cheong, set aside\n- SEPARATE 3 egg yolks from their whites, whisk the yolks to combined, then combine the yolks with the leftover rice and turmeric\n- MASSAGE the rice with wet hands until the yolks and turmeric have fully coated the rice, and no large clumps of rice remain\n- COMBINE all sauce ingredients, set aside\n\n**ON THE STOVE**\n- HEAT a wok as hot as possible, then add 4 tbsp peanut oil and long yao\n- ADD the garlic, ginger, and whites of the green onions, then saute for 15 seconds until fragrant\n- ADD the lap cheong and toss for 1-2 minutes\n- ADD the bok choy and toss to combine for 1-2 minutes\n- ADD the rice then toss to combine, using an overhand grip on the spatula to break up any large clumps of rice\n- ADD the sauce element to taste, then toss to combine\n- FINISH with greens of green onions",

I imagine that using only egg yolks (instead of egg whites + yolks) helps to create a deeper and more golden color. I haven't gotten a chance to test this out yet, but I imagine you could totally do this dish with the entire egg, instead of just the egg yolks. I talked a bit about this in [the full video](https://youtu.be/RVLR7u7-9WM) too if ur interested :-).\n\nlet me know if u try this one!",

One question - i notice that in your vids, the wok is smoking hot, and I understand that\u2019s the best way to make a stir fry. Unfortunately my place has an extremely sensitive smoke alarm, so I can\u2019t even get the pan too hot, let alone smoking. \n\nDo you have any tips to work with this kind of situation? Right now I just try to use a flat-bottom pan as hot as I can get it. I avoid the wok because it gets too hot too quick and always sets off the alarm. \nThanks in advance for your help!, and for great content!",

A good overhead hood above the stove and a decent air purifier always helps, but I think what has made the most difference for me is opening up the windows to a good cross breeze (so, not just one window, but windows that are opposite each other). This tends to help get the smoke cleared out of the room as I cook, and has honestly done a lot more than any of the other equipment I've tried. Prop a fan up by the window, and then you're pretty much set really.\n\nThe other thing I usually also do is just straight up turn off the smoke detectors before I start cooking, although that is also kind of a pain cause you have to remember to turn them back on afterward, haha.\n\nGood luck!",

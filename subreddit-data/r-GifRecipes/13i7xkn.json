I cut the tomatoes, put them in with the other veggies about halfway through, and used stock.\n\nOne other change I'd make - and I'm not sure if this was just my eggplants or what - would be to peel the eggplants. For some reason the skin remained a teensy bit thick and stiff while the rest was really well cooked. My husband said he didn't notice though.

It's just not \"wire-grilled\" cheese cooked on an open flame. English is about convenience, not accuracy.",

Just keep in mind you'll need some good rubber gloves for dipping the buns/rolls and ideally some face and eye protection before you mix the lye solution (which should be clearish by the time it's ready).\n\nNow, I realize that this is not at all practical for those of us without such things already handy, but if you want a _real_ pretzel crust, that's how you get it. The baking soda method is just as good for those not willing to deal with lye. :)",

The baking soda method, in theory, has the same chemical reaction happening as your dip 'em, but in practice the taste is different. Subtle, but different. A lot of it also has to do with the texture of the crust, and when you boil them the texture isn't the same as if you dip them in lye.\n\nLemme just put it this way: My pretzel buns saw a marked increase in sales once I started using the lye method. Since we switched, we haven't been able to keep them in stock! We get people telling us that half the time the package of buns doesn't even make it home because they get eaten in the car on the way.",

It's very difficult to cut yourself this way since it's only one hand doing the cutting and you have very good spatial awareness over one hand. You know exactly where the blade is, and know to stop pushing when you reach it. Even with very sharp paring knives this isn't a problem.",

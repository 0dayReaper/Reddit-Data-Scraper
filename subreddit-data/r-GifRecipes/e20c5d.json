Often you can sub out one ingredient for another in the same category (in this case fried rice paste as starch in lieu of a wheat based dough) and make something that tastes good. \n\nLike mochi is pretty much a filled doughnut hole, but with rice as starch instead of flour and bean paste (or whatever) for sweet instead of jelly.",

Still takes about 30 minutes but it's plenty low maintenance.  Lots of time to prep/cook other things.\n\nIf you rinse the rice before cooking (getting the starch off) it becomes less sticky and better for things like homemade fried rice/stir fry, but if you just cook it straight, you'll get more sticky, goey rice that works well for rolls.  Rinsing takes a while though, you have to rinse until the water runs mostly clear.  Makes a big difference though",

Boom, tastes just the same and you can just shovel it on in and devour it with a spoon. I get the aesthetic of looking like sushi but it\u2019s kinda not worth the effort",

It also doesn't burn the bottom regularly as would be common when making with a pot. \n\nDue to the variety of cooking equipment people have, a simple recipe like making rice is rather difficult to get right and generally takes multiple attempts to yield good results.\n\nSure, we got people here that'll make it seem like it's the same as using a microwave, but here in reality, we common folk mostly just use a rice cooker to expedite the process since making rice in a pot is rather tedious in comparison.",

It's folded with vanilla whipped cream and served with raspberry sauce or orange slices. It's so freaking good. \nWe call it Ris \u00e0 la Malta, but it's not really Maltese at all but a bastardisation of Riz \u00e0 l'amande (French for rice with almonds). No coconut milk in ours though. But I think it would be a nice substitution.",

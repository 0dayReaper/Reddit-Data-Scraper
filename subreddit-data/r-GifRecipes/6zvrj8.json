                            "comment": "I basically make one sauce that goes with anything teriyaki that I cook. I use soy sauce, mirin, garlic, grated ginger, honey, sugar (sometimes pineapple juice if I have it as a substitute), rice wine vinegar, and red pepper flakes (if I want to add that little kick). I use it as a marinade, baste meats with it if I'm grilling or broiling it, and/or cook it down into a nice glaze to cook my vegetables and meats in. With that, I do say my favorite recipe is Teriyaki Chicken with Fresh Cooked Pineapple and Onion. It all goes so well together which makes it one of my favorite recipes (so much better grilled with making the sauce as a glaze for the chicken and pineapple) to eat with a nice side of steamed rice :D \n\nEdit: Adding teriyaki recipe to anyone who wants it.\n\nI don't have an exact recipe but I can give you a rough estimate per pound which you can adjust to your tastes:) \n\nTeriyaki Sauce: \n\n1/4 cup Soy Sauce \n\n1/2 tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar\n\n1 tbsp Mirin \n\n1 tbsp Honey \n\n1 tbsp Sugar (Brown Sugar works too) \n\n1/2 tsp Grated Ginger \n\n1 Garlic Clove Chopped\n\nOptional: \n\n2 tbsp Pineapple Juice (Orange Juice works too) \n\n1/2 tsp Red Chili Flakes \n\n1/2 tbsp Sake\n\nThis is a basic that I work with then I adjust according to taste by I trying to balance it out to get that teriyaki flavor by add more or less of ingredients. I usually make double when I want to reduce it down to make a glaze or when I'm marinating it then save the other to baste or reduce. To make it thick, make a cornstarch slurry with a few tablespoons of water and a teaspoon or 2 of cornstarch.\n\nHope you enjoy! :D  \n\n\nEdit: Thank you so much kind stranger for the gold! I wasn't expecting how much you and everyone here would like my recipe. I hope I can provide more in the future. I hope you and everyone enjoy whatever teriyaki dish you make with it! :D",

Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl or cup and mix well.\n\n2. If the thickness of the chicken is uneven, make an incision where the flesh is thick and spread to level the thickness. Poke the skin with the tip of the knife in several places so that the sauce will get through to the flesh better.\n\n3. Heat a non-stick fry pan over medium heat. Place the chicken in the pan, skin side down. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the skin gets cooked to a golden brown. Turn the chicken over and cook for about 3 minutes. (Note 2) If a lot of fat oil came out of the skin, absorb excess oil with a paper towel (Note 3).\n\n4. When the chicken is nearly cooked, add the sauce, shake the pan to even the sauce and put the lid on. Cook for 30 seconds.\n\n5. Remove the lid and cook until the sauce thickens and reduces to about 1-1.5 tablespoons (Note 4). Turn the chicken over and coat the skin side with the sauce.\n\n6. Remove the pan from the heat and place the chicken on the cutting board, skin side up. Cover with foil for few minutes to let it cook further. Slice the chicken into 1.5-2cm thick pieces.\n\n7. Place mixed cabbage and carrot salad on a plate and then arrange the sliced chicken. Pour the sauce over the chicken and add a sprig of parsley/mint if using. \n\n8. Serve immediately.\n\n**Notes**\n\n1. I could not find chicken thigh with only skin on. So I bought chicken thighs with skin &amp; bone on and removed the bones. You can use skin off and even chicken breast if you prefer. The texture of the chicken will be different, particularly with chicken breast but the flavor should be the same.\n\n2. Depending on the thickness of the thigh fillets, time will vary.\n\n3. It is important to remove excess oil as much as possible. Too much oil from the fat prevents the teriyaki sauce from sticking to the meat. This is the reason for using a non-stick fry pan with no oil. If using a normal fry pan, I\u2019d suggest that you oil the pan with a small amount of oil when heating up.\n\n4. You need to retain enough sauce to pour over the chicken on the plate. After turning off the heat, the sauce continues to cook with pan\u2019s residual heat and concentrate further. So turn off the heat slightly earlier. You can always concentrate further if required.",

You might also want to reduce the amount of other liquids in the recipe to compensate for the fact that honey has liquid in it. It's pretty thick, so no need for added corn starch.\n\nHoney caramelizes faster than sugar, though, so you should cook it at a slightly lower temperature. It's also slightly acidic, so you might want to add a little amount of baking soda in your recipe to balance it all (1:5 ratio with honey should work), but this is not necessary unless you dislike the result.\n\nBut yeah, honey is more sugary than sugar. If reducing the sugar content of the recipe is your goal, honey is definitely not the solution (though it's fine if your goal is to reduce the amount of processed sugar).",

If the sauce is reduced down far enough, the temp can rise and that can burn\n2. If the sauce is spread thin enough, part of it can  evaporate more of the water out and then burn\n\nBasically, cooking with water or sufficiently moist foods can make things easier - water essentially limits the temperature the food can be, which among other things, limits its ability to burn. Which is good because sugar can easily caramelize and quickly after that burn.\n\nI'm assuming you haven't done many reductions. There's not a huge amount of sauce in this recipe, so the main thing is that it will look like there's more than there is wile you're reducing and it's bubbling away.  Stay with it and stir some. And occasionally pick it up from the flame/burner, which will quickly cause it to stop bubbling, and you can see where it stands - see if it's thick enough yet (see OP's gif for what it should look like on thickness).\n\nDo that a couple of times and you're much less likely to burn - but especially when it gets down to the point of bubbling up - do not leave it or you risk losing it by burning it.\n\nI hope that helps and doesn't scare you off. Long as you don't leave it alone too long, it's easy. :)",

I heard all this second or third hand, did you experience any of that? \n\n\nEdit:typo",

But it's commonly called the reproducibility problem and not the \"everyone is cheating\" problem.\n\nNone of the scientists I know who are japanese (or not japanese for that matter) would ever fudge any numbers. If I learned they did I would be shocked. Being skeptical to the point of disbelief of new data isn't exactly unheard of in science. In many cases being a conservative scientist is rarely a bad position to be in.",

They are *amazing* to tourist, because you are their guest. And like a guest, the politeness goes out the window when you overstay your welcome.\n\nDon't get me wrong; there are great people in Japan, and a lot of Japanese of all ages and creeds who are genuinely interested in other opinions/cultures/etc. So don't take this as a rant on how Japan is the worst place ever. It just wasn't the place in which I wanted to set down my roots. ",

But she can't have sugar, due to her Crohn's disease flaring up. She CAN, however, have most sugar substitutes (Splenda et al.), so I'm wondering if there's something about sugar specifically that makes it necessary in teriyaki sauce, or if we can use Splenda instead, and if so, if you have any tips.\n\nThank you for any advice!",

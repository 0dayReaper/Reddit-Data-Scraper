Most of the reason why I cook for myself is to stay healthy\n\n**Edit** I understand that butter and heavy cream are not healthy choices. The dish can clearly be done with olive oil and be healthier. No need to keep saying the same thing. This is healthier than 90% of the content on this sub. That's all I'm saying\n\n**Edit 2** now we've got the \"keto\" people out here saying \"well actually it's not unhealthy at all.\" First I've heard of this keto thing, but y'all need to make up ya damn minds",

I would always go shallots/garlic first for a quick pan sauce just to get a quick cook on them in the leftover fat from cooking the fish.\n\nI usually do:\n\n1. Cook protein and remove from pan (not sure why they left it in) to rest.  Keep about 1-2 tbsp of fat.\n\n2. Add shallots (maybe 1 min) and then garlic (30 sec) for brief saute.\n\n3. Add wine and start scraping bottom while boiling to get out some alcohol (then stock if using).  \n\n4. Reduce it down by at least half but can be to your preference.  While reducing, add any juices that may have collected on the plate your protein is resting on.\n\n5. Mount with a few tbsp butter (aka whisk in) off the heat.  Probably less overall fat than this butter+cream combo from this recipe.\n\n6. Final additions of lemon juice, chopped herbs (my default is parsley) salt and pepper and serve.",

I'll tell you what I know.\n\n* Take your salmon fillets (I use thawed frozen ones). Put them aside and heat up a bit of oil in a pan.\n\n* Start cooking some nice rice and some green beans or broccoli or asparagus. The salmon will come out salmon-coloured and orange, so choose a vegetable with a contrasting colour.\n\n* Toss the salmon in the hot pan. Let it sizzle briefly until it has a nice surface. Then turn and let sizzle some more. The sides should still be raw. \n\n* Toss some garlic in there, diced or whole cloves, just one or two. A little bit of tomato paste isn't wrong either.\n\n* Pour in orange juice, maybe 5-8 mm deep (don't drown the fish, you don't want to have to drink fishy orange juice, god!). Add rosemary and pepper. Season the fish that sticks out of the juice with powdered vegetable broth (or just salt, if you don't have that or think it's cheating).\n\n* Move the fish about so the juice gets underneath and the sauce gets heated evenly. I like to flip it about occasionally so it gets more orange flavour.\n\n* Keep cooking at a reasonably high temperature (stirring occasionally) until you see the orange juice start to change, then lower the temperature. \n\n* At this point, if the fish is not cooked, put a lid on it and lower temperature so the fish gets cooked. If the fish is nearly done, finish reducing the juice into sauce.\n\n* Serve it when the fish is done and the orange juice has been transformed into sauce. \n\nNow let's give this a name. *Mojo Salmon*. 'Cause my name starts with M, and the letters OJ are in there. ",

Drizzle a few drops of olive oil on each skin and spread it using your fingers. Top with a few salt flakes (not too many) then place another sheet of parchment paper on top sandwiching the salmon skins. Place an oven proof heavy object with a flat base on top to keep them flat or they will curl and bend once cooking. Place in pre heated oven and bake for 30 min at 375\u00b0F \u2013 190\u00b0C.\n\nGet your vegetables ready, peel the shallots and chop very finely, the finer the better. Chop the washed parsley leaves finely (remove the stalks first if any and keep a couple sprigs for garnish).\n\nOn moderate heat, place a frying pan and melt the butter. Once the butter is melted, place the salmon pieces topside down (opposite side of the skin) and cook in the butter until lightly golden brown. Check underneath and if light brown, flip over the fish (be gentle not to break them). Continue cooking until the butter is nutty brown.\n\nDeglaze with white wine, add the juice of half a lemon, add the chopped shallots into the sauce, not over the fish. Add the cream. Season the sauce with salt and pepper. Keep poaching the fish in the sauce until cooked. This should only take approx 3 minutes. It depends on the thickness of the fish and how you like it cooked. A touch translucent in the middle is perfect, if you like your fish cooked right through maybe cook it for 5 minutes and baste it using a spoon.\n\n\nRemove the fish carefully using an egg flipper or a fish spatula and place on a warm serving plate. Continue to reduce the sauce on high heat until it thickens to your liking. Add the parsley, mix well and pour over fish.\n\n\nRemove the skins from oven, strip away the paper and gently slide a knife or small spatula under each skin and place on your fish.\n",

In this recipe, I'd rather cook the salmon with the skin on, but you can't do that in the sauce otherwise it goes soggy. Can always remove the cooked salmon and then make the sauce in the pan, reintroduce the cooked salmon skin side up to warm back up then serve",

The moisture content in the butter will not allow proper for a proper sear. Since the temperature will be only 212 until all the moisture is boiled away. I'd replace the butter with something of a higher smoke point, such as ghee, or olive oil (non virgin).\n\nGet the pan hot, water should dance on it, add oil, sear the salmon on the skin side only, and don't touch it. Let it do it's work, and it will loosen off the pan by itself.\n\nThis gif doesn't really deglaze at all, there's no crispy bits in the pan at all, the pan never got hot enough, it's just adding wine to the butter.\n\nRemove the fish when reducing the sauce, fish can overcook way too easily, it should never get over about 120F. Use your thermometer to make sure it doesn't!\n\nI might even mix up the ordering a bit and saute the shallots first, then saute the salmon. As is it's just boiled and doesn't get a chance to caramelize. ",

Unless you\u2019re leaving it unattended while cooking, you should be fine. If it\u2019s your first time cooking it just leave it skin side down on the pan with some oil, wait until it begins to turn opaque around the edges near the pan. Then flip and cook on the top for a minute or two. Then finish on the oven skin side down at 350 for 5 minutes. Very simple and if and if you somehow overcook the skin, you can just take it off and the actual fish will be perfectly fine.",

Now I usually have it in the fridge. \n\n* If you make coffee at home it tastes way better with a few drops of real cream. \"Coffee creamer\" is garbage.\n* If you cook practically any meat in a pan, (like a hamburger minus the grease, or pork chop) theres always little burned bits left on the pan. Lower the heat and pour some cream in and scrape the brown bits off. Salt if needed for taste, simmer a tad till it's as thick as you want, boom cream sauce. \n* If it's getting close to the expiration date, just whip it with some powdered sugar and a drop of vanilla (or any other flavored extract like almond or none). You'll have enough to top some ice cream or what not.\n* Plenty of baked items benefit by substituting **some** of the milk for cream\n\nYah, when it fits in the grocery budget I try to keep heavy cream around.

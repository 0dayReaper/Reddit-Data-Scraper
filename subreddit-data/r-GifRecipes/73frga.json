I can't remember exactly (so it might've been a literal cappuccino) but it looked absolutely lovely. \n\nIt was like a warm coffee, some whipped cream on top with a sprinkle of chocolate shavings. It looked incredible. Think you could watch it and make it? Ever since I saw that I've basically been addicted to cappuccinos because that's what I imagine it's taste like. ",

Here are a few tips I can add: \n\n1.\ta little bit more salt doesn\u2019t hurt \n2.\tyou can rest overnight, and then put it in the fridge. It\u2019ll keep for a few days like this. Then bring to room temp and do the second rest etc. - I make a double sized batch, rest overnight, break it in half, finish one half, store the rest in the fridge, then when first loaf runs out I finish the second half. \n3.\tdust the baking paper with some cornmeal for a nice little textured bottom. \n4.\tit sucks, but waiting for it to cool before cutting/eating is critical. Sure, warm fresh bread is fucking amazing. But this one tends to go gummy and loses its structure if you break that delightful little crust too early. You\u2019ve got to wait for it to completely cool. Trust me. I\u2019ve probably gone in too early at least 50 times, and regretted it every time.",

Letting it FULLY cool (6+ hours) makes such a huge difference in the texture of the crumb.",

So if you're a new baker but want to make a no-knead bread that actually has some nice gluten development and open crumb, I'd definitely recommend giving this a go!\n\n**The recipe is posted here in the comments (under the stickied automod comment at the top of this thread) and over at** [**https://hostthetoast.com/easy-no-knead-artisan-bread**](https://hostthetoast.com/easy-no-knead-artisan-bread)**.**\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know!\n\n **Here's the link to the youtube video on the process:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z94MbAfOiM**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z94MbAfOiM) I'm brand new to this format, so I'm so eager to hear your thoughts so I can adapt going forward!!",

I score the dough ball quite deep (beacuse it makes those crispy ears on the crust that my sweetheart likes so much). IDK if this all makes any difference, but my breads aren't undercooked. It might be, that in the end, everything is up to a specific oven chahracteristic. In time I learned that not even two ovens bake exactely the same.",

Drop the dough in the pot, grab the lid and put it back on to place the pot in the oven.\n\nMy wife looks at me and says, didn't that hurt? I responded, more than you know.\n\nTip, put a pot holder on top of the lid so you remember to put them back on before grabbing a 450 degree lid bare handed.\n\nSecond tip. You can add other ingredients like cheese, nuts, fruits/veggies to make a variety of breads. Keep the extras to under 1.5 cups total and allow a longer rise time.",

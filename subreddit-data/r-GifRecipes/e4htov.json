They go through a 'pre-cook' process where they are fried from 2-3 minutes, depending on the age of the oil. This is the most important step, as they set the base for a perfectly cooked fry. They should be soft, dull in appearance, and limp when held. There should be a slight amount of resistance when squeezed between your fingers. The amount of time it takes can vary wildly throughout a shift, which is why a fry calibration should be done every 2 hours. However, this is hard to do when in the middle of a rush. They must sit for at least 2 minutes after being pre-cooked to ensure the fry is done cooking through from the pre-cook stage. They are then cooked again for a couple of minutes, relying on pure visuals to get a perfect fry. 15 seconds under or over can cause it to be under or overcooked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly,. the fries are the hardest part. The burgers and hot dogs are much easier to cook.",

In a large bowl, cut butter into flour with your hands or a pastry cutter. Add egg yolk, cold water, and salt. Bring dough together into a ball.\n2. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate while you make the meringue topping.\n\nMeringue Topping\n\n1. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, beat egg whites with salt until foamy. Gradually add the sugar, until stiff peaks form. Add vanilla extract.\n2. Place meringue into piping bag with a star tip. Set aside.\n\nAssembly\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 325F (300F convection bake). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.\n2. Sprinkle flour onto clean flat surface for dough rolling. Roll out the dough to a thickness of ~3mm.\n3. Using a small, round cookie cutter, cut into 4cm (diameter) disks. Place onto cookie sheets lined with parchment paper, spacing each cookie ~5cm apart.\n4. Place one Toffee candy on top of each dough round.\n5. Pipe a dome of meringue over each Toffee candy, covering the cookie biscuit.\n6. Sprinkle meringue domes lightly with cocoa and bake the cookies for about 25 minutes in an oven preheated to 325 F. Reduce oven temperature to 300F and cook for another 15 minutes.\n7. Turn off oven and leave cookies in the oven to continue to cool/dry (note: be sure to leave oven door propped open to allow heat to slowly escape).\n8. Enjoy!",

If I wanted pad Thai and had no tamarind I could easily just use vinegar, limes, and molasses/brown sugar which I likely do have on hand and create an almost identical product. Fish sauce is much more potent, distinct, and has a lot of umami that you're only really going to find in other fermented fish products.",

This post is incredibly removed from actual pad Thai in appearance and flavor. I usually get it with shrimp but I've had it with chicken and tofu as well... Pretty good with any of these proteins!\n\nAlso if you're into spicy foods, check out pad kee mao (drunken noodles) and pad ka prow gai (Thai holy basil goodness). Thai food is probably my favorite cuisine due to its wide range of intense flavors. Also try out the curries (green, red, yellow, jungle, massaman, Panang). So much flavor.",

Your taste buds will thank you, hah!\n\nEdit: I just provided the above rec since I saw you're in Ohio and I had heard folks going to or coming from Ohio regularly when I was there. I'm sure you can find a similar restaurant closer by you if you're far from Ft. Wayne.",

Press and cut the tofu into 1cm cubes\n2.  Finely chop the garlic\n3.  Chop the ginger into matchsticks\n4.  Finely dice the carrots and red bell pepper\n5.  Chop the baby corn into quarters\n6.  Deseed and finely slice the red chilies\n7.  Finely slice the spring onion\n\n**Heat the oil**\n\n1.  Add the ginger &amp; garlic and stir for about a minute (don't let the garlic brown)\n2.  Add the tofu cubes to the pan and cook for a few minutes, until they start to darken on the outside\n3.  Add the smooth peanut butter &amp; stir so it's all mixed in nicely, then add the soy sauce, Sriracha and water\n4.  Stir and cook down until you have a nice thick paste coating the tofu\n5.  Add the coconut sugar stir until it's dissolved and mixed in thoroughly\n\n**Cook the vegetables and serve**\n\n1.  Add the vegetables and mix round so they're all well covered in the sauce (don't let them get too soft - the veg will ideally have a lovely crunch to them)\n2.  Add the crushed nuts, green onions &amp; stir round\n3.  Then, add the freshly cooked rice noodles (they should be fresh out the pan &amp; still very much wet - this makes the sauce the perfect consistency)\n4.  Mix them round so they're well covered in sauce\n5.  Serve immediately with a dressing of Sriracha, crushed peanuts &amp; spring onions\n\n[Source](https://www.bosh.tv/recipes/quick-n-easy-pad-thai)",

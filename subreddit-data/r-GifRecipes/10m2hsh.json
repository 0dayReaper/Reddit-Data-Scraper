            "comment": "hello hi everyone! Wesley here. Today we are diving back into our series dedicated to Chinese comfort food classics with a shot at a Shanghainese scallion flatbread, or \u201cqiang bing.\u201d Now, those following along will know that we certainly are no strangers to the slightly more common scallion pancakes or \u201ccong you bing.\u201d And while our flatbread\u2019s construction has many similarities, it is in fact QUITE different from a cong you bing for one reason in particular, which is that our flatbread contains leavening agents, today that\u2019s gonna be a bit of dry active yeast and baking powder. \n\nFor those unfamiliar, at its core, both the cong you bing and qiang bing are assembled very similarly. We have a high hydration flour and water dough that we\u2019re then rolling out very thinly, layering in scallions and sesame oil, and finally wrapping into coils to create nice flakey layers. Today however, for our qiang bing, the addition of our yeast and baking powder is going to create a significant amount more rise, first in our proofing process, and again in our frying process, resulting in what I can only describe as more of a foccacia like texture, due to its fluffy, oily qualities. Hope you try it.

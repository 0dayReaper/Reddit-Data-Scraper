Chocolate chips in the crust and chocolate fudge in the middle is great without overdoing it IMHO. Sweetened condensed milk + chocolate chips is not exactly the most fancy fudge but is still a sound idea and extremely popular. The layering aspect is fun and interesting. I don't feel like the recipe really cut any corners and all the ingredients are basic household staples. The correct tools were used and they didn't use too few/too many bowls. Best of all, they didn't advertise a specific brand of anything. Frankly, I like the recipe and the video.\n\nIf you really REALLY wanted to hear what was \"wrong\" you'd start having to really look for nitpicky things that probably wouldn't actually affect the final product. These are the sorts of things I would consider if I was serving this to royalty or if I really wanted to impress someone.\n\n- sifting flour &amp; the baking powder together before adding it to the butter mixture\n\n- don't mix the flour all the way into the dough before adding chocolate chips. Mix it 90% of the way and then add the chips so by the time the chips are evenly distributed, you've barely mixed it to 100%. Although, for this one, maybe you do want the dough a little \"tougher\" than normal, since it has to support the fudge in the middle. So maybe this was intentional.\n\n- add a little more dough to the top compared to the video. Doing so will prevent the fudge from smudging into the top layer, like what happened in the video\n\nBut I mean, these would have almost no noticeable differences in the final product and if it were me, I wouldn't bother worrying about it.\n\nEDIT: Just thought of one thing I would do differently. Since there was an e-coli outbreak linked to raw flour last year, and I don't necessarily know how long that flour has been sitting on my shelf, I'd bake the flour by itself before making these. This way I can safely enjoy licking the raw cookie dough batter off of spoon/spatula/bowl without fear of infection. Note that raw eggs are generally fine and have been for quite some time now, but if you're at an increased risk of infection and/or have a compromised immune system, please consult your physician.",

It might be a little too sweet for my taste, but in moderation, I guess it's not too much sugar. \n\nPersonally, I would probably use less white sugar in the cookie section. I typically use a little less white sugar in a chocolate chip cookie recipe and since the fudge filling is going to add more sweetness, this might just taste like a sugar blast. But that's more my opinion vs saying that there's something wrong objectively with the recipe.",

Unsweetened coconut is 2 net carbs per 2 tbsp, an ounce of almonds is about 3.5 net carbs, an ounce of dark chocolate (~70% cacao) is around 9 net carbs. Even if the recipe made 50 cookies (which I highly doubt), you're still looking at 6 or 7 net carbs per cookie, assuming you use 1 c of dark chocolate chips (70% cacao). That is a LOT of carbs to spend on a snack and would very likely spike your blood sugar a lot which is what many on the keto diet are trying to avoid.",

It's why some countries people refrigerate eggs and in others they don't. The US is one of the few countries that do wash their eggs which leaves the egg shells pores open and allows bacteria in if not properly refrigerated.",

What I did was take half the cookie mixture and put it in the pan, then take the 2nd half and spread it on parchment paper on a cookie sheet, which I stuck in the freezer for 15 min ( I did this while the chocolate cooled). Then I  spread the fudge, then placed the top half of the cookie dough on. No mess!\nThe dough was definitely not as loose as shown in the video. \n\nHere's the written recipe (with my edits):\n\n1c butter\n2/3 cup Brown sugar\n2/3 cup reg sugar\n2 eggs\n1 tsp salt\n1 tsp Vanilla\n2 1/2 cups Flour\n1 1/2 tsp Baking soda\n2c choc chips\n1 can sweetened condensed milk\n\nCream together butter &amp; sugar. Add eggs, salt &amp; vanilla.\nMix in flour &amp; baking soda \nAdd 1 cup of chocolate chips\n\nIn a small pan, heat condensed milk and remaining chocolate chips over med heat. Stir until chocolate is melted. Let cool a bit.\n\nIn a 11x7 baking dish, spread out half the cookie mixture.\nOn a separate metal cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, spread out remaining cookie mixture to the same size as the baking dish. Chill in the freezer for 10-15 minutes.\n\nSpread chocolate fudge mixture on top of the cookie dough in the baking dish.\nTake the chilled top layer, flip over on top of chocolate and peel back the paper. Press top layer down a bit.\n\nBake 350\u00b0 for 30 minutes.",

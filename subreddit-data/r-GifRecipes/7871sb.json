It makes the cocaine soluble in the organic solvent octane, any nonpolar solvent can be used, gasoline is cheap, and ubiquitous. This allows you to separate the cocaine alkaloid from the leaf residue by pulling it into the organic, nonpolar phase of the mix. Then, the battery acid (sulfuric acid) acidifies the cocaine in the organic layer, making it less soluble in the nonpolar gasoline, pulling it into the aqueous layer. separate the phases, then neutralize the acid with a strong alkali, and the cocaine will precipitate. You can do it cleaner, and better with lab chemicals, but they are harder to get than consumer commodities, which are basically the same thing. \n\nIf smoking it is what you want, you reduce it to the free base by dissolving the hydrochloride (produced above) with water and a base like sodium bicarb, and heating it to produce [refreshing crack](https://i.imgur.com/oQSee9hh.jpg).

The method is suitable for such small batches that pseudoephedrine restrictions are less effective, it uses chemicals that are easier to obtain (though no less dangerous than traditional methods), and it is so easy to carry out that some addicts have made the drug while driving.[101] It involves placing crushed pseudoephedrine tablets into a nonpressurized container containing ammonium nitrate, water, and a hydrophobic solvent such as Coleman fuel[102] or automotive starting fluid, to which lye and lithium (from lithium batteries) is added. Hydrogen chloride gas produced by a reaction of salt with sulfuric acid is then used to recover crystals for purification. The container needs to be \"burped\" periodically to prevent failure under accumulating pressure, as exposure of the lithium to the air can spark a flash fire.[102] The battery lithium can react with water to shatter a container and potentially start a fire or explosion.[102]\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_and_culture_of_substituted_amphetamines#Illegal_synthesis",

Italian sausage or breakfast sausage often come prepared and seasoned here.  If a recipe calls for ground pork or ground beef then they are asking for unseasoned ground meat.   If a recipe is detailed enough they will often refer to actual sausages as sausage links meaning inside the casing. They will also explain preparation of said sausage(s). Cut the sausages into 1/2in slices vs brown the Italian sausage.  Singular form most likely means ground seasoned meat. \n\nI never thought I would type out such a detailed description of sausage but there you go.  Hope this helps",

Also, there is just context clues.",

You can make it with beef instead of sausage or omit for vegetarian. If vegetarian, I'd throw in a can of chickpeas to get some protein.\n\n* 1 pound hot Italian sausage, loose\n* 1 small yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning\n* Crushed red pepper to taste\n* 2 tablespoons tomato paste\n* \u00bd cup white wine\n* 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes\n* \u00bd cup heavy cream\n* \u00bd cup finely grated parm\n* \u00bd cup grated mozzarella cheese\n* 16 ounces rigatoni\n* Fresh basil, for serving\n* Extra virgin olive oil\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Brown the sausage:**\n\n1. Crumble sausage into a cold skillet. Turn heat to medium-high. Cook, occasionally turning and breaking up the sausage with your spoon, for 12-15 minutes until cooked through. Drain off excess fat if needed, leaving sausage in the skillet.\n\n**Cook the aromatics:**\n\n1. Add the onion to the sausage and cook over medium heat for 6-7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.\n2. Melt the butter into the skillet and add Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper to taste. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. (I forgot to record this part, whoops.)\n\n**Sizzle the tomato paste:**\n\n1. Add tomato paste and toss to coat everything in the paste. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the paste deepens in color and begins to stick to the skillet.\n\n**Simmer the sauce:**\n\n1. Pour in white wine and bring to a boil. Add the tomatoes and boil 1-2 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes as you cook the pasta. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar (optional).\n2. Taste the sauce and season. Stir in heavy cream and simmer 10 minutes.\n3. Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F.\n\n**Cook the pasta:**\n\n1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta until 1\u20132 minutes shy of al dente. Drain.\n\n**Assemble and bake the casserole:**\n\n1. Spoon half of the sauce into a baking dish. Add the cooked pasta, the rest of the sauce, and the grated parm and toss to coat.\n2. Arrange the mozzarella on top and drizzle with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Finish with a few cracks of black pepper. Transfer to oven for 20 minutes. Broil 2-3 minutes until cheese is browned is bubbly.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Remove from the oven and garnish with a few basil leaves. Serve and enjoy!",

You could start with the onions first, then add sausage but then you run the risk of burning the onions in getting the crisp browned edges of sausage. Or you could do the sausage and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. \n\nSince you may want to drain off excess fat from the skillet, it\u2019s more challenging to drain off the fat when there are onions and garlic in the skillet. \n\nI found this way was super easy, onions softened, and I didn\u2019t have to fuss with another plate or bowl and sausage wasn\u2019t overcooked.\n\nBut the impact of doing it one way over the other in this dish is pretty negligible so add things in whichever order works for you :-)",

The pure alcohol apparently helps intensify and accentuate flavors in the dish, among other claims. The recipe became very popular in Italy and in the United States around the 1980s, when it was offered to discotheque customers. The recipe thus became an icon of the fashionable cuisine of the time, which preferred the use of cream in first courses.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

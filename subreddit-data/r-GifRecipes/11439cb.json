It's mostly curry powder, butter, and a thickener (they used flour but cornstarch sounds more ideal!)",

Turn heat to medium, and add garlic and sautee until fragrant, around 1 minute. Add in mushrooms and sautee until softened, around 3 minutes. Add in beef and sautee until browned, around 2 minutes.  \n3. Add in roma tomato, curry cubes, and water until covered. Cover with a lid and let boil. Once boiling, turn heat to medium-low and cook for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper, to taste! Note that curry cubes are salty, so please taste before adding extra seasoning.  \n4. Form Dodoco by using short grain rice and saran wrap, alternatively you can wet your hands and form the rice balls. Form 1 round body, 2 oblong ears, and a larger oblong for the tail.  \n5. Cut seaweed to form 2 circular eyes and a \"v\" for the mouth and small oblong pickled plum for blush.  \n6. Assemble the curry and enjoy hot!",

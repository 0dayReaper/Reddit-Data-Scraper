But the reason why we don't pepper a steak until after it's been fried, is because then you lose the pepper's character. So whether you fry it with or without pepper, that's a matter of taste, and you do you, but remember to also add pepper after frying :)",

Maybe me you could help me out?\n\nThe gouda I used is semi dry, it isn't soft but neither hard and crumbly. It has a really strong smell, I would say pungent and also a very unusual flavor. Actually I was thinking it had something wrong with it because the taste is really strong and has a combination of bitter, tangy and sort of sweet taste. The skin on it was green.\n\nNot sure if that helps, but I'll go back to the supermarket this week and I'll ask, hopefully we can find out which gouda it is.\n\nI know the lady behind the deli counter told me that not all gouda melt when cooked, and that is why she suggested this one.",

The longer it ages, the less water and more concentrated the flavour becomes, the cheese itself also becomes a bit brittle. You said its not brittle and its obviously not in the video, so doubt its this. \n\nFull green label could mean grass fed cows, which is the good stuff. Usually there is some green on the label somewhere.",

At first, it looked easy but I couldn't make the ball shape or any shape, it always slipped from hands, you definitely need a cheesecloth to dry the curd and in the end it costs me more than store bought mozzarella. \n\nAlthough, it tasted fine.",

Overwork it and you get tough, rubbery mozz. \n\nThe cheese is slick, hard to handle, and needs to be kept unpleasantly/painfully hot while you're working it. Around 170-190F / 76-90C, iirc. Even wearing gloves or dipping my hands in cold water between stretches couldn't make that a pleasant activity.\n\n*Edit*: The whey/water is kept 170-190F. The curd itself is probably a little bit cooler since you keep pulling it out to work. Still hot though, since ~135-140F is the absolute minimum curd temp for stretching mozzarella (and hotter = easier stretch).",

Higher temperature makes it stretch easier and form up quicker. The cheese itself probably stays a little cooler than the whey temp since you keep pulling it out for quick stretches, but it definitely pulls easier when kept hotter.\n\nExample: https://curd-nerd.com/soft-cheese-recipes/mozzarella/ *\"When the curd is ready to stretch, add the cheese salt to the whey you reserved and heat to 90\u00baC or 195\u00baF.\"*\n\nMozzarella is normally worked at high temps: *\"The separated curd (pH 5.2) is heated in water at 80\u00b0C, kneaded and formed into 150-250 g balls...\"* [Source.](https://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=ijds.2011.199.226) Even when traditionally made in Italy they're often keeping the whey at 80-90C.",

The curd has to be at least ~135-140F to stretch at all, stretches much more easily when hotter, and spends a fair bit of time between stretches sitting in 180F+ water. I'll have to stick a thermometer in next time I make some to see.\n\nThough I'd be surprised if the curd wasn't at least 160-170F when the mass of mozz is pulling particularly easily. Thick gloves or cold water (plus short, quick round of stretching) helps a ton with not getting burnt, since they extend how long it takes for your skin to get up to a damaging temperature.",

Costs me maybe $2-4 ingredients and energy to bake two basic french boules, but my bread really tastes so much better. \n\nSome things are still not worth it. I\u2019ve made butter from cream once, that was a terrible value because the cream was so expensive comparatively, and even if I got the process down pat, butter is pretty basic. Usually you are just looking for a particular fat/water ratio. Some butter does taste better than others, but I think that comes down to the source of cream, which I don\u2019t have access to.",

The hotter method kills harmful bacteria but also kills other organisms that can contribute to flavor.

I worked with camel rennet and it made great cheese\n\nOver 90% of the rennet used is from the first two categories. In the EU only the second one and calf rennet are used. Pretty sure the US uses GMO rennet. I worked with all rennets and they all made great cheeses. On paper GMO rennet is the best rennet because it produces the least amount of bitterness but it is hard to taste a difference if you are not trained. Honestly I never tasted a difference personally.",

At my current workplace mozzarella is produced, I worked at a cheese dairy for two years that produced cagliata which is basically mozzarella curd before the heating and \"filata\" process and I visited two other cheese dairies, a small one where buffalo milk was used, and a large one where cow milk was used. In every case rennet was used. Just to make that I am not mistaken I even took my dusty cheese bible (Cheese technology by Joseph Kammerlehner) and voila rennet is always used. If you do not use rennet the resulting texture of the curd will be grainy, short and hard to strech and I am suprised that the person in the gif is able to stretch it like that without it breaking. Even if it is possible the tase will be different from original because a rennet casein tastes differently from acid casein. Original mozzarella should be about 6:4 to 7:3 rennet/acid while the one in the gif is 100% acid but don't quote be on that.\n\nFurthermore \"Soft cheese\" is a weird term to describe cheeses because it could include a brie, camembert type cheese and the ones you named which are all manufactured differently. The main difference is that some of them ripe and others don't. I prefer fresh cheese or unripened cheese for cream cheese or quarg. Theses types of cheeses traditionally do not use rennet. Nowadays rennet is added because the resulting cheeses have less acidity (which is usually preferred by younger consumers), the yield is better and the cheese is still creamy.\n\nFeta also always uses rennet. I produced Feta myself (with average success I have to admit) and the largest Feta and brine cheese producer where I am from use rennet.\n\nThe whole soft cheeses use acid while firmer cheeses use rennet is also, sorry to say, wrong. Like I said a lot of soft cheeses like Brie use rennet. Some cheeses like sour milk cheeses do not use rennet under any circumstance and are firm, even tough and chewy.\n\nPlease do not take this personally but pretty much everything what you wrote is pretty much wrong.\n\nIf you or anyone else has further questions feel free to ask. Dairy is my passion :/",

Homemade feta is ridiculously good, btw.\n\nHere's a good walkthrough for feta: https://www.finecooking.com/article/how-to-make-your-own-feta \n\nAnd I really recommend the book \"The Beginner's Guide to Cheesemaking\" by Elena Santogade if you're interested in making cheese. It's really helpful with clearly explaining what's going on and all the steps needed for various cheeses.\n\nCheesemaking takes some time (mostly non-active waiting time), you need to be good about keeping the area &amp; materials very clean, and need to be able to follow directions well...but it's not very difficult overall.",

I'm inclined to think this video is fake but perhaps if you formed large enough curds and you might be able to get them to melt together... unclear. This is more or less the recipe for basic ricotta yet somehow they wound up with mozzarella....hmmmmmm. If this is really how they did this then you'll struggle *hard* to replicate these results.\n\nTrue mozzarella uses rennet to get the curds to separate. I'm not sure if they did that here or not to be honest their curd looks too formed to be acid formed but too weak to have been with rennet. It's almost like they just melted cheese and threw it in a pot of water. Their weigh is also much more cloudy than I'd expect which is further evidence that they didn't use rennet. Also while any acid would probably work citric acid is most commonly used.\n\nGenerally you want to make a brine out of the whey and store the cheese in the whey.\n\nBasically don't trust this as a source on how to make mozzarella. This recipe isn't telling the truth about something, is making it out to be easier than it is, and isn't going to come out correct.",

            "comment": "This is cool, but I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the interesting procedures and techniques of making, showcasing, and cutting Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan) cheese. Interesting enough it is aged for many years and kept within a wooden mold branded and stamped with the name, plant\u2019s number, month and year of the cheese\u2019 production. Over the storage it is kept in a specific atmosphere, being turned slightly on its shelves, and each shelf hand cleaned over its long production. After 12 months a Consorzio comes in and inspects every wheel, the cheese is then tested by a master grader who taps each wheel\u2019s wooden rind to indentify for undesirable cracks and voids within the cheese. Those who pass are heat-branded with the Consorzio\u2019s logo. Those who do not pass are marked with lines and crosses all around the rind to inform consumers they are not getting too quality product with that wheel. The way and techniques of cutting and showcasing are intricate and used to show the integrity, taste, and history of each wheel.

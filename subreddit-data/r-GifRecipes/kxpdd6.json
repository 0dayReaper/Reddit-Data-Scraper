To show how sorry I am I'm putting this up front. \n\nTL;DR watch seasons 1-4.  It's good stuff.  Skip season five.  It's hot garbage \n\nI like the anime(and manga) because underneath the extra sexualized visuals of how fucking good something tastes, which were gratuitous but creative, the show is a pretty decent display of real cooking techniques.  Everything is just turned up to 11.  And ridiculous.  Everything is obscene and ridiculous.  It's such a wild ride. \n\nAnd that goes on for like four seasons.  But, during the fourth season, they started to cut back the quality of the animation.  As well as skipping some details in terms of how they go about cooking and how they describe food and why doing what they did was a challenge. \n\nBy season five the show has devolved into a slide show of back shots of chefs cutting food or mixing a bowl but there is no movement on screen.  Just a slow pan across a wide shot of a still image that *maybe* has the background change to emphasize whatever the topic is. \n\nIt's a travesty.  The most animated it gets is when someone's clothes blow off their body but even that is a panned shot of a larger image and most all the characters on screen are completely still.  \n\nI think what sucks the most is that the overall story for season 5 is pretty cool.  Campy and over used tropes but still, I was invested in the direction it was going.  But it feels rushed and the animation is so not worth sitting through to get a morsel of leftover story (pun intended) that has a weak overall payoff.  \n\nI encourage you to watch the first four seasons.  Especially if you like cooking at all.  I find the culinary magics that they perform to be honestly inspiring.  Please never watch season five. I would be happy to summarize each episode to those interested and give a synopsis but save your valuable time and just skip it.",

We binged all the available seasons.\n\nIt turns out that even though she doesn\u2019t give a shit about soul reapers or ninja villages, cooking anime is something she loves now.\n\nI highly recommend this anime as an entry for people who love cooking but don\u2019t care to see people fight using superpowers. All that\u2019s required is a sense of humor. So glad I watched this with my wife, we joke and pretend to orgasm whenever we cook for each other lol",

It's the only way to convey how great something tastes when words just will not do. It is over the top, because it has to be. Because it's an anime, their strongest medium is their visuals, and in an anime about cooking techniques and flavors, the best way to describe them is with intense visual representations of the dish they're eating. It'd be a pretty boring show if a judge ate some steak and was like \"It's cooked perfectly, the crust is excellent and it has retained a tender and buttery texture inside.\"\n\nDon't look at it as \"they're just having food sex\", it's their way of telling you how delicious food is without just saying \"Yeah this is the best steak I've ever had\". Plus it's pretty funny, and if you're into it, plenty of fan service to go around as well.",

I used one large potato, one large, white onion, two boxes of mushrooms, many many strips of bacon, and some rosemary. I peeled and boiled the potato until it was mushy. Separately I sauted the diced onions and mushrooms, added the mashed potatoes, a bit of salt, pepper, and some spices (my preference). I sauted all of them together till most of the liquid evaporated and it was pretty solid. Then I moulded it into a roast like shape, wrapped it in bacon and tied it together with a food thread with rosemary in between and slow roasted it in the oven at 320 for an hour I believe, till the bacon looked about crispy. Turned out great! Though I do suggest some corn flour while cooking the potatoes with the onions and mushrooms so that the whole mixture becomes pretty hard. Either that, or fry it with extra oil. Essentially, you don't want the potatoes/onion/mushroom mix to be too soggy.",

It\u2019s pretty pricy and the add-ons (ie bamboo steamer attachment) are also surprisingly pricy. \n\n(If I correctly called out the pan you\u2019re using), do you think it is worth the investment?

Also, that marinade is awesome, I think next time I will cook it an incorporate it to the sauce\n\nPackages:\nI added a pinch of salt because flour with zero salt tends to taste papery. The turmeric does give it a nice touch without interfering with the chicken.\nA note on quantity, the recipe said it made 2 services so I was expecting 2 large pancakes... I doubled it since I wanted 4 but I ended up with about 8, 12 inch pancakes and some leftover batter\n\nSauce:\nIt was a huge hit!... definitely do not skip. I made it half chilli sauce half ketchup because my wife can't handle too much heat... I also added a tad of extra honey. I would highly recommend cooking this sauce (just heating it up for a few minutes) and making the day before... I am certain it would help blend and mature the flavours\n\nOverall it was a tasty meal which was fun for me to make and for the family to eat!... thanks so much /u/issagrill for compiling it... now Food Wars is in our \"to watch\" anime list!",

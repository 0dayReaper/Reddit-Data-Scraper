Is that 70+% chance that the test will turn up positive, 70% chance that a test that showed positive was actually false, or what?\n\nBecause if it's the latter, that doesn't actually tell much about the accuracy of the test itself.\n\n_________________________________\n\nEdit: Because you guys are too lazy to read comments, or notice the 9 other guys telling me the exact same thing, I suggest you read up on this topic a bit more.\n\nIf 70% of all tests were false positives, that would be bad. It would be literally worse than guessing if the substance is a given drug. But that's not the case - it's 70% **of positives**. Which means that about 1/3 of the positives actually are drugs, and that for every criminal, two innocents are arrested. Which is good for a field test, because it narrows down the amount of suspects.\n\nThe real issue with the tests is that your legal system is fucked up - the peer jury is the cause for this issue as they're ready to convict before a more accurate test comes back positive.",

People arrested based on a detection of cocaine from those kits are threatened; they can plead guilty and only spend a few weeks in jail, or plead not guilty and be sent to prison for a few years. https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/magazine/how-a-2-roadside-drug-test-sends-innocent-people-to-jail.html\n\nAccording to the same article, the false-positive rates for meth are actually 21% (21% of the positive tests done by police officers in the field, which are later sent to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement lab are actually negative).\n\nThe \"21%\" can change a lot, however, depending on who did the test, and a lot of other factors; the residue from common household cleaners regularly set them off, false-arrests and imprisonments have been made because the blue-light from the sirens made the test look positive, whether the officer broke the tubes in the test kit in the correct order, etc.",

Just buy the kind that isn't bleached white, or the natural sugar, or beet sugar, etc. and blue food coloring you just have to purchase one not derived from bugs. It's pretty easy you just do a google search and select the one that is vegan.\n\nI'd say there's really no challenge whatsoever in this situation. Veganism sounds extremely challenging but most vegans will tell you it's quite easy...\n\n",

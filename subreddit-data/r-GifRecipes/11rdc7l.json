            "comment": "hello! Hi everyone, Wesley here. Today we are diving back into one of my favorite series on this channel, which is our series dedicated the wonderful, weird, and culturally murky world of Asian fusion cuisine, with a shot at a variation on the crispy garlic noodles that we serve at the Woo Can Cook pop up here in Oakland. Garlic noodles of course makes for an interesting jumping off point because their origins in Asian cuisine is\u2026very murky and confusing. As far as I can tell, some claim that it originated here in the Bay Area from a Vietnamese restaurant in San Francisco, while others say that it comes from the Italian pasta aglio olio. But really, is there any real point in culturally claiming the idea of putting garlic in noodles\u2026? I mean. Come on.\n\nIn any case for the Bay Area locals, our pop up out at Wondrous Brewing in Emeryville serves garlic noodles made with super thin, wok fried egg noodles that puff up during the fry due to their high egg content. Then we top these off with chili oil and of course, fried garlic chips, yielding in a crispy, garlicy, spicy noodle dish that\u2019s quickly becoming a fan favorite. Today we\u2019re gonna do a fun variation on that dish by including a bit of kimchi and nori seaweed to go along with our garlic chips to add a nice bit of brininess and texture to our noodles. Then finally, just to sort of riff on the idea of a pasta aglio olio, we\u2019re gonna bloom some Korean red chili flakes or gochugaru in our garlic oil, to create a Korean inspired chili garlic oil finish, not unlike the use of red chili flake in an aglio olio. Hope you try it. [**Follow the full video on youtube**](https://youtu.be/_pCcesPODF8) for the whole story too!\n\n**Woo Can Cook** is a series where we reproduce fun foods and recipes from my childhood. Some of them are authentically Chinese and/or pan-Asian, but a lot of them are odd Americanized versions that I inherited from my parents and grandparents while growing up in the Bay Area/California.\n\n**Homebase** (Recipes, Livestream Schedule, Music and more): [Woo Can Cook](https://WooCanCook.com)\n\n**Recipes**: [Woo Can Cook (Youtube)](https://youtube.com/woocancook?sub_confirmation=1)\n\n**Music**: [Woo Cooks Beats (Lofi Beats to Cook to)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9McCfCIkWtc&amp;list=PL72dM3fKnbHupDC0cIOHxaHBvjZLY3TdT&amp;index=13)\n\n**Woo Can Cook Fried Rice Pop Up (Every Thurs-Sun @ Wondrous Brewing!)**: https://WooCanCook.com/eats\n\n**TikTok** (short recipes and Woo Cooks Beats): [Woo Can Cook](https://www.tiktok.com/@woocancook)\n\n**Instagram** (pop-up schedule, music, and random doggo cameos): [@woocancook](https://instagram.com/WooCanCook)\n\n**RECIPE**\nhttps://woocancook.com/kimchi-garlic-noodles\n\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n- 4 cloves garlic\n- 1 inch (about 1 tbsp) ginger\n- 1lb thin fresh egg noodles\n- 8oz kimchi\n- 8 shiitake mushroom\n- nori\n- gochugaru\n- peanut oil\n\n**INGREDIENTS (sauce)**\n- 4 tbsp low sodium soy sauce (or 2 tbsp full sodium soy sauce)\n- 1 tbsp mirin\n- 1 tbsp gochujang\n- 4 tbsp gochugaru\n- 1 tbsp brown sugar\n- 2 tbsp sesame oil\n- 4 tbsp kimchi brine (or 1 tbsp each rice vinegar and fish sauce)\n\n**PREP**\n- CRUSH and mince the garlic, set aside\n- FINE MINCE the ginger, set aside\n- REHYRDATE the shiitake mushrooms in boiling water for 15 minutes, then slice into strips and set aside\n- CUT the nori into strips with kitchen sheers, set aside\n- COMBINE all sauce ingredients, set aside\n\n**ON THE STOVE**\n- HEAT a wok over low heat, then add 4 tbsp peanut oil and long yao\n- ADD the garlic and simmer for 5-10 minutes until lightly golden, then remove from heat and add 1 tbsp gochugaru\n- REHEAT a wok as hot as possible, then add 4 tbsp peanut oil and long yao\n- ADD the ginger and saute until fragrant for about 15 seconds\n- ADD the kimchi and saute for 1-2 minutes, then remove\n- REHEAT a wok as hot as possible, then add 4 tbsp peanut oil and long yao\n- ADD the noodles and toss with constant agitation for 2-3 minutes until puffed up\n- ADD the garlic oil, kimchi, and sauce mixture back to the wok and toss to combine\n- REMOVE from heat and finish with nori",

It seems like a long time, but VERY low heat over a long duration of time is the real key to making garlic chips. if the fire is too hot, you'll end up with burnt chips.\n\nto be fair, I think mine went for closer to 5 minutes, but definitely wanna emphasize that it takes WAY longer than you think to make garlic chips, cause you need extremely low heat for it to not burn. let me know if you try this!",

            "comment": "Hello hi everyone! Wesley here. Today we\u2019re diving back into our series dedicated to Korean comfort food classics with a shot a stone pot variation of one of my favorite Korean BBQ dishes of all time, which is the dolsot bibimbap. For those unfamiliar, a bibimbap is a Korean rice bowl dish served with a number of vegetable sides (today we\u2019re going with some bean sprouts, kimchi and picked daikon), and most prominently features a thinly sliced steak known as bulgogi. Not too long ago, some may recall that we also did a simpler version of this dish served in a normal ceramic bowl, but today, I finally managed to locate my dolsot, which is one of these heavy stone bowls made of\u2026stone. \n\nYou may also come across dolsots made of clay or sometimes cast iron, but the most important bit to note is that our dolsot has the capacity for extremely high heat retention, making it perfect for those restaurant style \u201csizzling\u201d platings that you\u2019ve probably seen the wait staff very precariously carrying in Korean BBQ restaurants. This means that we\u2019re going to preheat our pot, then plate our bibimbap inside of it, and then serve immediately, creating a crispy, crunchy rice texture that\u2019s essentially still cooking, on the table. Finally, no bibimbap is ever complete without a sunnyside up fried egg, which of course means that we\u2019re going to be doing a lacy wok fried egg today for the crispiest fried egg that you will literally ever create. Hope you try it.

For me personally, I found that the key is to preheat the bowl in the oven, then oil the bowl before putting the rice in, which tends to do the trick. After that if it's still not happening, sometimes I'll throw it back on the stovetop for a little bit more crispiness, but I think really the key is to make sure to oil the bowl though. I talked a bit about this in [the full video](https://youtu.be/ZGaWvt157bE) too, if ur interested!",

                    "comment": "Nice! Indeed, bulgogi can be made with a variety of different types of beef, although the cheaper and tougher cuts are more typical. My personal favorite is flank (mostly cause it\u2019s the easiest for me to find), but top cut sirloin, skirt, or tenderloin are also common. I\u2019m pretty sure the thin cut stuff at the grocery store is actually flank (I.e. the stuff they use for shabu shabu and hot pot), but I guess it depends on the store.

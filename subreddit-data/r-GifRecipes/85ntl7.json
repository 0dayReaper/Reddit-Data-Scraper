So we went to Mexican place nearby, ate a great meal and ordered the fired ice cream at the end. When we got it, it was 2 regular scoops of plain ol' vanilla ice cream in one of those flaky taco salad shells with some drizzled chocolate and powdered sugar. It was, hands down, the lamest dessert I have ever eaten at a restaurant.",

The purpose is to keep the ball of ice cream as solid as possible up until the moment you drop it in the fryer. The goal is to fry the batter golden brown before the ice cream inside melts, so you want the ball of ice cream as cold as possible to give you as much time as possible to keep it in the fryer. Too little time in the fryer, and you get what you saw in the gif. They probably should be put back in the freezer after wrapping them in cake and only pulled out right before battering and frying.",

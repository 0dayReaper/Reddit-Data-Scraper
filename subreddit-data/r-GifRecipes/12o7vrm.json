                                    "comment": "Well, in Japanese cooking there are A LOT of different varieties of hotpot (we call it [*nab\u00e9*](https://www.justonecookbook.com/nabemono-japanese-hot-pot/)), but the main concept is you prepare the base soup first. We usually use *dashi* stock from kelp and/or skipjack tuna/bonito fish, but you can use whatever else is more available to you. Once the broth in the pot gets bubbly you can start adding protein such as bite-sized chicken thighs, fish (cod, haddock, etc), scallops, shrimps, even shaved meat. You can skip this step if you\u2019re vegan or vegetarian, of course, and just move on to add the vegetables (sliced carrots, Napa cabbage, **enoki mushroom**, white scallion/spring onion, and so on), and tofu. That\u2019s basically the main gist of Japanese hotpot, but you can check the URL I linked above for some recipes I found.\n\nAdding enoki into miso soup is so simple, even kids can do it. Miso soup is one of the staples here in Japan. Here\u2019s a recipe from some quick googling: [basic enoki miso soup](https://dailycookingquest.com/enoki-miso-soup.html).\n\nI just have to remind you to make sure you heat the enoki properly to avoid any possible toxins, so add it early into the hotpot and lower the fire so it can simmer in the soup slowly without sacrificing the overall flavor of the soup. Let me know if you end up liking it or not! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)",

A sprinkle of water with a damp paper towel and defrosted and heated in the microwave means your rice is done with your mushrooms in a few minutes.  Sometimes cooked with a little quinoa just elevates bowl dishes",

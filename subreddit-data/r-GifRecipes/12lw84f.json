There is no strict distinction between \"regular\" food and vegan food but rather, it's all just food and some of it happens to be vegan. Like if you go to a restaurant, you can order a dish and there will be no mention of the fact that it's vegan - there's no special symbol next to it, it's not in its own section, etc.\n\nI think it's a very American thing for the fact that something being vegan is a big deal. American food culture places a very heavy emphasis on meat to the point where it's a common sentiment here that if the dish doesn't have meat, it's not a meal. Dishes all need to be rich, savory, fatty, salty, and just a sensory overload and if it doesn't, then it's a snack",

This is not that. This wouldn't be identifiable as Alfredo in any way.  So give it a name that represents what it IS. Why is that so difficult?",

For us Italians  that is the kind of pasta (the so called \"pasta in bianco\") you give to little kids and  people who are recovering after an illness (clearly with much less butter and parmigiano...)\n\nSo it is not seen as something you eat at a restaurant, unless you sprinkle some finely sliced truffle on it, but in that case you just call it fettuccine al tartufo.",

Some people add heavy cream which is okay because it's just liquid butter really. \n\n  \nNo garlic. It ruins the subtly of the dish. You should be tasting the pasta and the cheese, and maybe the butter.\n\nAmericans like to add garlic to anything they deem Italian and end up with a dish that becomes one note rather than a celebration of the ingredients.

Cut off the sprouting end of the garlic bulb, revealing the cloves inside.\n3.  Put the bulb in the middle of the tin foil square, drizzle over a little olive oil, season with a little salt and pepper, wrap the bulb in the tin foil, pop the bulb on the tray with the cauliflower, put the tray in the oven and roast for 25 mins until the cauliflower is tender.\n\n**Infuse the oat milk**\n\n1.  Add the oat milk, nooch, rosemary, thyme and bay leaf to the saucepan and simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes.\n2.  Take the pan off the stove and leave to cool.\n\n**Make the sauce**\n\n1.  Pour the infused milk into a jug through a sieve to catch the herbs.\n2.  Remove the tray from the oven and leave to cool to room temperature.\n3.  Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves out of their skins into the food processor | Add the cauliflower to the processor and blitz into a pur\u00e9e.\n4.  Keep the processor running and gradually pour the milk into the processor through the hole in the top.\n5.  When the sauce is completely smooth, turn off the processor.\n\n**Prepare the pasta and serve**\n\n1.  Add the pasta to a large pot of boiling salted water and cook according to packet instructions (usually 9 minutes).\n2.  Whilst the pasta is cooking, pour the sauce into a large, high sided saucepan and simmer gently over a medium heat.\n3.  Pick the parsley leaves from the stalks.\n4.  Taste the sauce and season to perfection with salt, pepper and nooch.\n5.  Add a little (approx 50ml) pasta water to the sauce, drain the pasta, transfer to the pan and stir into the sauce.\n6.  Transfer the Creamy Roasted Garlic Alfredo to serving bowls, garnish with pepper and parsley and serve immediately.\n\n[Source](https://www.bosh.tv/recipes/creamy-roasted-garlic-alfredo)",

Writing recipe and procedure was not very effective, they often don't they could not or did not understand how to do it.   \nSo I decided to create videos as well ...... and everyone appreciated it because videos can convey so many things.   \nThat's why I often repost my old videos  \nThat's why I always insert the link to my Fycat or imgur video (but it only lasts 1 minute) and also to my youtube video (which is more complete and full of content to understand the steps of preparing the dish)  \n\n\nMy channel has less of 900 member, for sure I don't do this for money :-) (my best video has max 2000 views :-) I also just like the fact that this post also got 10 or more comments, and I love that  \n\nAnyway :-) I wish a nice monday to everyone",

Pb that tastes like a plain old ground up peanut is just not exciting. \n\nBut that being said, sunflower seed butter is better than even the best PB.",

            "comment": "Link to source: [https://www.recipetineats.com/dog-cake-recipe/](https://www.recipetineats.com/dog-cake-recipe/) \n\n***A dog cake with \"frosting\" that looks so impossibly real, it may be mistakenly eaten by unsuspecting people! Made with dog friendly ingredients with an irresistible peanut butter smell. Fine for humans to consume - but a bit odd tasting for our palette!***\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### DOG BIRTHDAY CAKE:\n\n* 2 eggs\n* 1/2 cup (120 g) peanut butter *(spread or pure)*\n* 1/4 cup (65 ml) oil *(canola, vegetable)*\n* 2/3 cup (165 ml) milk (or water)\n* 1/3 cup (100g) honey or maple syrup *(or apple sauce or skip it)*\n* 2 1/2 cups shredded carrot *(2 large)*\n* 2 cups (300 g) whole wheat / wholemeal flour *(or white flour)*\n* 2.5 tsp baking soda\n\n#### DOG FRIENDLY FLUFFY FROSTING (WHIPPED POTATO YOGURT):\n\n* 600 - 700 g / 1.2 - 1.4 lb potatoes *, peeled, cut into chunks*\n* 3/4 - 1 cup yogurt (plain unsweetened) or water\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### CAKE:\n\n* Preheat oven to 180\u00b0C/350\u00b0F (160\u00b0C fan).\n* Grease and line the base of 2 x 20 cm/8\" cake pans.\n* Whisk together eggs, peanut butter, oil, honey and milk (little peanut butter lumps ok).\n* Stir in carrots. Then add flour and baking soda, stir until just combined (over mixing = hard cake = sad birthday pooch).\n* Divide batter between the cake pans, spread and smooth surface.\n* Bake 25 minutes or until skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.\n* Cool on racks. Frost per below.\n\n#### DOGGIE FLUFFY FROSTING:\n\n* Boil, steam or microwave potato until very soft.\n* Whip potato and yoghurt with an electric beater until fluffy and smooth as possible (won't go 100% smooth) - about 1 1/2 minutes on medium speed (speed 5).\n* Use water as needed to loosen frosting to soft spreadable consistency (like human buttercream frosting!). Use while warm (it \"sets\" when it cools).\n\n#### FROST:\n\n* Spread 1/4 frosting on one cake.\n* Top with other cake. Frost tops and sides with remaining frosting, reserving some to pipe decorations if desired (3/4 cup frosting).\n\n### Recipe Notes:\n\n**1. Cake pan**\u00a0 **- could also use a bundt pan or just one cake pan and then cut the cake in half. Or even a square pan about 20cm/8\".**\n\n**2. Serving size -** **Appropriate serving size should be determined having regard to the health, size, activeness and digestive sensitivities of your dog. Do not use in place of a meal - just like with human cakes, dog cakes are not a well rounded nutritious meal!**\n\n**3. Nutrition commentary (assumes 20 slices):**\n\n* **Eggs** **- good source of protein for dogs**\n* **Peanut butter** **- \"treat\" element, dogs are mad for peanut butter! Gives the cake an irresistible peanut butter smell, 2.5 tsp per slice**\n* **Oil** **- very small amount used, about 1/2 tsp per slice**\n* **Milk** **- if you're concerned about your dog consuming dairy, sub with water. Works out at 1.5 tsp per serve, and also remember it's cooked!**\n* **Honey** **- For a touch of sweetness, 3/4 tsp per slice. Can skip if you want.**\n* **Carrot** **- carrot is good for dogs! It also makes the sponge moist. Can sub with zucchini or sweet potato.**\n* **Wholewheat / wholemeal flour -\u00a0just like with humans, carbs are fine to consume in moderation!**\n* **Baking soda** **- to make the sponge rise.**\n* **Potato** **- Same as flour, cooked potato is fine to consume in moderation! It's a better, healthier option than slathering the cake with a peanut butter yogurt frosting which seems to be the default for dog cake recipes. Too much yogurt or peanut butter is not good for our pooches (whether commercial sweetened spread or even pure unsweetened peanut butter, it's very high in fat. Some yogurt is good for dogs but not vast quantities)**\n* **Yogurt** **- probiotics in yogurt is good for dogs digestive system, just like with humans! If your dog is sensitive to dairy, just use water.**\n\n**4. Nutrition** **per slice.**\n\n### NUTRITION INFORMATION:\n\n**Calories:** **157kcal**\n\n**Carbohydrates:** **20g** \n\n**Protein:** **4g** \n\n**Fat:** **6g** \n\n**Saturated Fat:** **1g** \n\n**Cholesterol:** **16mg** \n\n**Sodium:** **204mg** \n\n**Fiber:** **1g** \n\n**Sugar:** **5g**",

            "comment": "Everyone commenting that the lactose, starch, and gluten are bad for dogs are spreading misinformation. Not all dogs are lactose intolerant, just as humans. And small amounts, like in a slice of this cake, every once in a while will not hurt your dog if they are not sensitive to dairy. Gluten is present is many dog foods and is a good source of protein for pups, unless of course your specific dog has an insensitivity like some humans do. Starch has actually been show to be important in dog\u2019s diets over the course of evolution, and they have an abundance of copies of the gene for protein that breaks down starch (amylase). Also, it\u2019s not like the dog is eating the entire cake in one sitting, so all of these ingredients are there in moderation. Happy birthday to all the birthday puppers out there!\n\nSources: https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/nutrition/can-dogs-drink-milk/\n\nhttps://m.petmd.com/blogs/nutritionnuggets/jcoates/2012/nov/is_gluten_free_dog_food_better-29456\n\nhttps://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/01/diet-shaped-dog-domestication",

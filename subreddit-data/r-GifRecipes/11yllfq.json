You need to let the initial pasta water sit and cool for about 5 minutes though or else it\u2019s too hot and won\u2019t properly temper the cheese/butter and it won\u2019t emulsify properly. Then you have a broken mess. Which is exactly why people started adding cream. It\u2019s been homogenized and acts as an emulsifier to bind the milk fat (butter) with the milk solids (cheese). \n\n\nOP made a really nice shrimp linguine with white wine cream sauce though.",

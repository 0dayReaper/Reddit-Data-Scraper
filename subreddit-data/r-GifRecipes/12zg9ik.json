Preheat oven to 325F (300F convection oven). Gather a 9\" springform pan, set aside.\n\nChocolate Cookie Crust\n\n1. In a medium bowl, combine chocolate cookie crumbs with sugar and melted butter. Pour cookie crumb mixture into your 9\" springform pan. Press crumbs into the base of your pan. Set aside.\n\nCheesecake\n\n1. In a large bowl, using a hand mixer, beat together softened cream cheese with granulated sugar. Mix until just combined.\n2. Add eggs, one at a time, until mixture is smooth and creamy. Add vanilla and salt.\n3. In a small bowl, add hot heavy cream to white chocolate. Let stand for 2-3min then stir until chocolate is melted. Add chocolate mixture to egg/cheesecake mixture. You want a mixture that is smooth and creamy.\n4. Meanwhile, add sugar to thawed berries. Mix until combined. Let stand for 1-2 min to allow the sugar to dissolve into the berries.\n\nAssembly &amp; Baking\n\n1. Pour half of the cheesecake mixture into the springform pan with cookie crust. Add spoonfuls of raspberry to the surface of the cheesecake mixture, swirl with a knife. Add remaining 1/2 of cheesecake mixture, and repeat raspberry dolloping process. Use a toothpick/knife to swirl through the mixture, creating a spiral design.\n2. Place springform pan onto baking sheet, to collect any leaks of oil during baking. Bake in a oven preheated to 325F for 1h 30-40 minutes or until mixture gently set at the edges and is slightly wobbly in the centre. Turn off oven and allow cheesecake to cool in the oven. (Note: I recommend partially propping open the door of your oven to allow heat to slowly escape while cheesecake cools).\n3. Once cheesecake is cool to room temperature, place in the refrigerator to set for ~4h to overnight.\n\nDecorations\n\n1. Remove the rim of your springform pan. Place cheesecake on flat surface.\n2. In a small bowl mix 1 cup of thawed frozen raspberries with 2 tsp of sugar. Stir until combined. Let sit for 1-2 minutes until sugar is dissolved.\n3. In a medium bowl, combine heavy cream with sugar, and vanilla extract. Whip to a light, airy, whipped cream texture. Set aside.\n4. Dollop additional raspberry sauce on surface of the cheesecake (note: I like adding additional raspberry mixture to the raspberry dollops/cracks in the cheesecake) and decorate cheesecake with pipped Chantilly cream. Top with additional raspberries, and shaved white chocolate, as desired!\n5. Cut, serve, and enjoy!",

It never releases cleanly.\n\nBe very careful blending with a hand mixer.  You do not want to overmix, it causes the cheesecake to crack and have a weird texture.  Cheesecake should be dense.\n\nTurn the temp wayyyyy down.  It should be cooked in a waterbath at like 225*F.  I think Alton Browns recipe has you preheat the oven, place the cheesecake in, then turn the oven off but leave the oven light on for warmth.  \n\nUnless you're making a basque cheesecake, then toast the shit out of it.  \n\n\nOverall I think it looks really tasty,  and the ingredients seem pretty solid.  I think the fruit in the batter complicates an already complicated process, and I'd rather just place the compote on top after it's finished.  Bonus points since that hides any cracks/bubbles on top!",

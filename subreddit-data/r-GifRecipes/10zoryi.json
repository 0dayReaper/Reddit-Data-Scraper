This is likely the most important step in a medianoche it really improves the flavor) then slice it about 1/4 inch when done. Slather Dijon mustard on the bread a ton a cheese place your favorite ham and place the pork on top. Put the top half of the Hawaiin rolls back on top put it in the oven at some lower temperature than what they used. Pull them out when the munchies have kicked in really nice and they look good slice up chow down.",

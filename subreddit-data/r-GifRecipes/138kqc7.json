And [jelly](https://i.imgur.com/f1XVTtv.png) in the USA is also otherwise taken as a word for something else, another member of the [jam](https://i.imgur.com/jP2I0fe.png) family (going all the way up to [preserves](https://i.imgur.com/WhgdeaK.png)). In the UK and places like that, jelly doesn't mean any kind of jam, it means jelly/jello - you wouldn't put it on your toast. I sometimes wonder if that's why people in the UK think the idea of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is weird. Maybe they think it's peanut butter and jello.\n\nBut jelly/jello's consistency just has to do with how much gelatin/gelatine you put into it. You can go stiffer if you want to.\n\ntldr: if you want the fruity wobbly dessert treat in the USA, you're going to have to ask for jello, because otherwise you're going to get either confusion or something to spread on your toast. Meanwhile Americans visiting anywhere in the Jelly Zone are going to get either confusion or the wrong thing if they ask for jelly for their toast.",

All my life it's been treated like some gross \"Why would you even?\" type of dish, but you know what? Inflation is cuh-coming for me, and jelly is a cheap, easy dessert with some visual flair.\n\nAlso, if you make jelly with carbonated water (or gingerale is also super-yummy), they jelly holds the bubbles and makes a light, bubbly texture.",

However, there are drinks that do actually use juice from melons such as Yubari melon (from Hokkaido). \n\n&gt; In cafes, when something is just called soda, this often refers to melon soda. Further, it is also used as a base for \u201ccream soda\u201d, or soda topped with ice cream. However, in Okinawa and other countries, \u201ccream soda\u201d refers not to ice cream-topped soda drinks, but rather to a dark brown, vanilla-scented fizzy drink.\n\nIn other words, I\u2019m just using \u201cmelon syrup\u201d, but if you want to make a more natural version, you could\nuse Yubari melon if you can get it (it will be orange, and opaque). Yubari melon is a cultivar of cantaloupe, so I would assume cantaloupe would be a tasty choice too. I\u2019d be inclined to pur\u00e9e and sweeten a bit it, but I\u2019ve never done it that way so I can\u2019t give measurements without playing around first. Generally speaking I like the texture of 5g gelatin per 300 grams\nLiquid, so after making your pur\u00e9e I think you could calculate out from there to arrive at something reasonable.",

I would try Japanese or Asian markets if you are in the states \u2014 the syrup is used for kakig\u014dri/shaved ice, so as summer comes around they may be even more likely to stock it.\n\nActually, in summer, even Daiso/100\u00a5 stores sell this syrup, so if you live in an area where Daiso has made inroads, you could check there.\n\nAlternatively, you could also see what googling around for different  combinations of \u201cmelon\u201d \u201cshaved ice\u201d \u201ckakigori\u201d \u201csyrup\u201d and see if anything available and affordable shows up.",

Mm.. Before refrigerators were common jello was a status thing since it requires easy cooling to set the gelatin, so alot of people never had easy access to it. But after fridges became household items it became a cheap staple and housewives everywhere were putting canned foods and leftovers and whatever else the fuck they had on hand in jello molds. You may have seen those absurd photos online of like. Spaghetti-O's in jello from a bundt pan mold, weird shit like that - it's not as far fetched as you might think. Or at least it wasn't. These moms had recipe books stuffed full of magazine clippings of weird shit to mold into jellos, I'm telling ya\n\nJello being perceived as for invalids and children is likely more of a feeling of societal shame and an unwillingness to look at their culinary history than any real dislike for jello Hahaha. And obviously jello isn't objectively bad\n\nI could be wrong in thinking it's mostly based in America, of course. It wouldn't be surprising if this happened elsewhere too, but I've never met *anyone* who looks at those jello recipe books fondly regardless of where they're from. My least favourite is probably somewhere between shrimp salad jello and olive medley ones, but I've seen layered turkey dinner ones, stroganoff-like ones, chicken noodle soup molded to look like a tower etc. Morally unconscionable, really.",

I didn\u2019t really \u201cget\u201d jelly until I living in Japan, where jelly desserts have remained popular and never been out of style. In these subtropical summers with no AC, when it feels too hot to even chew, there is nothing better than a fresh fruit or coffee jelly from the fridge.",

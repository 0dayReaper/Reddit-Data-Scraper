            "comment": "Hello! Hi everyone, Wesley here. Today we\u2019re diving back into our series dedicated to deconstructing Americanized Chinese cuisine with a shot at the PF Chang\u2019s dish known as \u201cGinger Chicken with Broccoli.\u201d For those new to the channel, in this series, we have been deconstructing iconically Americanized dishes from Chinese cuisine, and seeing what it might look like if we were to cook the dish through the lens of more traditional Chinese wok cooking. Ginger chicken is not a complicated concept, it\u2019s basically a stir fry with ginger, chicken, and\u2026broccoli\u2026pretty straightforward enough. What does jump off the page from their menu description however, is that the dish specifically calls for STEAMED broccoli. \n\nBroccoli of course, being a very dense and durable veggie, is commonly par-cooked with a quick blanch or steam to tenderize it before it goes into the pan, resulting in a more tender piece of broccoli to pair with your chicken. My personal favorite way of stir frying broccoli however, is to slice it into longer, thinner spears (replicating the shape and size of CHINESE broccoli, or gailan), which is a little bit more friendly in flash cooks and stir fries. So! Today I thought we\u2019d do something a little bit different, and instead of trying to come up with a \u201cbetter\u201d version of ginger chicken, what we\u2019re gonna do instead is cook the exact same dish with the exact same ingredients, but using two wildly different approaches to wok cooking, one using steamed broccoli florets, and a second approach using flash fried broccoli spears. The result I hope should be an interesting dive into\u2026how to cook broccoli\u2026! Hope you try it.

I think personally I prefer the second version, just because it\u2019s a little more similar to how a traditional stir fry would come together, which in turn yields a crispier and crunchier veggie. That said, Ive used the same steaming method in the first version for plenty of stir fries that feature a really dense veggie (I particularly like it with green beans). Let me know if u try this one!",

I\u2019ve found that rendering bacon fat has been particularly affective for seasoning woks, but really it\u2019s just about repetition though. I think after the 4th or 5th meal, this particular wok was cooking great. Before that though, I definitely have run into that problem before, where the acids peel off the seasoning. \n\nWe also replace the woks at the pop up every few months or so though, and it only takes maybe 20-30 minutes to really build up a seasoning, since we\u2019re cooking at such a high volume, so maybe just cook a big meal, and it\u2019ll get the wok in shape...! Good luck!",

The whole process took maybe 10 minutes, though.\n\nAs for wok hei, you can replicate it with a butane torch, using it to ignite a little bit of the oil vapor in the wok. \n[Kenji explains.](https://www.seriouseats.com/hei-now-youre-a-wok-star-a-fiery-hack-for-stir-frying-at-home)",

Thing works amazingly with my carbon steel wok and stir fries come together extremely quickly with the high heat.

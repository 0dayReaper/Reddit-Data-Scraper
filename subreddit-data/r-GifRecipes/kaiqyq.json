But a lot of work goes into filming a good video, most of it in lighting, but also getting the right angle, the right movement and so on. And if you see two different meals, then that means they had to make it twice.  \nOf course, had they made both look similar, they could have prevented the blaring continuity error. But perhaps that was the point, and the one with two rows just wasn't that appealing to film from that angle.\n\nAll I'm saying is that it's hard work, so keep that in mind. I considered making a recipe video once or twice for fun, but thinking about having to cook something *and* handle all the lights and cameras and then also maybe having to do it all multiple times made me realise it was too much work.",

With potatoes like these, the starchy potatoes are better because they absorb the liquid a little more but will remain firm, kinda like an al dente pasta, which is definitely what you want.\n\nRed potatoes would probably work, but I don\u2019t think they will absorb the liquid the way starchy potatoes will and would probably be more like roasted potatoes with sauce in texture.\n\nBut they might still taste good.

We do not sprinkle bread over things in an oven. (Exceptions may exist). \n\nYou get the texture by cooking properly. And often by letting cheese bing with the stuff on the top.

It's fairly similar to the OP, except that it uses cream rather than bechamel sauce, and it's usually not topped with cheese and it's just the potatoes and cream themselves that are browned.

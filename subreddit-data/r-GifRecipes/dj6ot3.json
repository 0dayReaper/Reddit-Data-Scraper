E.g., if you put an old fashioned in the pod, make more old fashioned and put it in a mason jar to store the pods (but dont use the calcium salts)\n\nI'd keep it in the fridge as well",

I can't remember what we put in the water and sodium alginate mixture but I do remember it made made clumps or worm like shapes depending on how thick you poured it. The \"goo\" we poured became solid over time but if it didn't completely cure, we could break it and the liquid ends would seal up in the mixture.\n\nEdit: I only have Fireball whiskey but I could try it.",

If the liquid is the same inside and outside the pod then there is no worry. \n\nIf you store them in water, youll get watered down pods and youll pull them out of water with small amounts of whiskey and other mixers\n\nIf you keep them dry the sodium alginate will probably form a dried layer and crack, or simply shrink until it pops from pressure inside getting too great.",

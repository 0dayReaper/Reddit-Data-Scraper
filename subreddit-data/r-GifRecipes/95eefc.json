Specialty ingredients are usually uber expensive and just jack up the cost of the meal...which imo kind of defeats the purpose of home cooking except for very special occasions. Unless its a key ingredient, they can generally be substituted out for something else. ",

Look at me. I asked you a very simple question you mouthy little shit.\n\nAll you had to do was answer like a normal person and we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation. I don\u2019t actually care what a 12 year old is doing on their iPad, but no, you had to say \u201cWhat\u2019s a computer.\u201d\n\nDo you think you\u2019re in a Wes Anderson movie? Do you think you\u2019re Zooey Deschanel? You\u2019re not. Don\u2019t ask me who Wes Anderson is, I swear to God. Stop doing tarot and astrology readings on Tumblr for five seconds and just tell me you know what a computer is and I\u2019ll leave you alone.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to lecture you. I like your mom and dad, I think they\u2019re good parents, but clearly something has gone wrong here, and if they won\u2019t take it into their own hands then I\u2019m taking it into mine for the good of the neighborhood.\n\nYour dad has a laptop, so even if you had somehow avoided the room in your house that had a desktop computer in it until last year, you\u2019re absolutely aware of the concept of a computer.\n\nI know you\u2019re not a weird \u201cno TV\u201d household either, so even if you thought that laptop was just some kind of weird heavy slate-gray folder, you\u2019ve seen cartoons or TV shows with computers\u2026 I see you moving to open your mouth, don\u2019t ask me \u201cWhat\u2019s a TV?\u201d or I will absolutely slap you. Barb from Stranger Things-lookin\u2019 ass.\n\nLook, it\u2019s starting to get dark, and a crowd is gathering, and I feel like this all might be a waste of time, but I am absolutely not leaving this back yard until you look me in the eyes and tell me that you know what a computer is. It\u2019s really that simple.\n\nI don\u2019t want to make a big thing out of this, but I\u2019m literally prepared to go on a hunger strike if you don\u2019t admit, in front of me and God, that you\u2019re aware of the concept of a computer.\n\nYou weren\u2019t dropped onto this earth yesterday afternoon, fully formed and with a taste for doing quirky stuff on the go, you\u2019re not Athena any more than your dad is Zeus. Oh, you get that reference. You expect me to believe you\u2019re familiar with the specifics of Greek mythological figures\u2019 origins but not a computer? Fuck you.\n\n\n\nWith credit to /u/thrillhouse1988",

            "comment": "Recipe by: [So Yummy](https://soyummy.co/recipe/tiramisu-american/)\n\n**About Tiramisu**\n\nTiramisu is a layered dessert somewhat similar to trifle. While there are lots of variations, the basic tiramisu is made from layers of ladyfinger cookies dipped in coffee (and other ingredients, see my notes at the bottom), and zabaione (custard made from egg yolks, marsala, and sugar) mixed with mascarpone (a rich Italian cream cheese). It usually has cocoa dusted over the top, and sometimes has whipped cream included. \n\nI am aware that **this recipe is NOT a tiramisu**. But it is a \u201ctiramisu,\u201d in that it is a playful spin with similar construction. Graham crackers instead of ladyfingers, marshmallow instead of sabayon. I haven\u2019t actually made this recipe yet so I can\u2019t fully vouch for it, but I\u2019ve made a lot of tiramisu\u2014I\u2019m interested to give this one a try. \n\n**Their Recipe**\n\n1 \u00bc cup Amoretti Premium Syrup Crema di Tiramisu, plus \u00bc cup\n\n1 cup coffee or espresso, room temperature\n\n2 cups heavy cream\n\n16 oz container mascarpone cheese\n\n2 teaspoons Amoretti S\u2019mores Extract\n\n\u00bd cup toasted marshmallows\n\nGraham crackers (how many will depend on the number of layers you want)\n\nCocoa powder, for dusting\n\nMarshmallow fluff, for garnish\n\nStart by making the soak. Take an empty water bottle and using a thumbtack or other sharp object, poke 5-6 small holes in the lid. Remove the lid and pour in 1 cup of coffee and the \u00bc cup of Amoretti Crema di Tiramisu. Screw the lid back on and then, covering the holes with your thumb, shake the water bottle until the coffee and the crema have emulsified.\n\nIn a 9\u00d713 casserole dish, use the water bottle to spray the coffee soak to create a base layer. Then lay down twelve graham crackers and soak them again. \n\nWhile your graham crackers are absorbing the liquid, make the cream base. Take a bowl of ice and place a smaller bowl on top of it. This creates a reverse double boiler, creating a perfectly cold environment to whip cream in half the time it normally takes. Pour the 2 cups of heavy cream into the bowl and whip until stiff peaks form.\n\nLightly fold the 16 oz container of mascarpone into the whipped cream just to combine, and then mix in the 2 tsp of Amoretti S\u2019mores Extract and 1/2 cup toasted marshmallows. \n\nBegin assembling your tiramisu; spread the cream on top of the graham crackers, followed by a layer of chocolate shavings (for easy chocolate shavings, run a vegetable peeler along a chocolate bar). Repeat the pattern: graham crackers, soak, cream, chocolate shavings, and you are finished once you reach the top of the casserole dish, and at that point do one final layer of cream. \n\nWith the handle of a wooden spoon, poke 13 holes into the tiramisu, approximately aim for the middle of the graham cracker squares. Fill each hole with Amoretti Crema di Tiramisu. With the remaining cream, pipe dollops over the entire tiramisu, taking extra care to cover up the holes, and then dust the entire confection with cocoa powder. You can design the top any way you want but we thought dollops look prettiest.\n\nThen refrigerate your tiramisu for at least 30 minutes and up to one hour, but not any longer otherwise your graham crackers will get too soggy. Slice into squares and serve it up!\n\nTo make this dessert extra fancy and special, schmear one to two tablespoons of marshmallow creme onto a plate and lightly torch it. It\u2019s a sweet, s\u2019moresy note to end the dish!\n\n**My own notes**: The authors of this recipe are pushing the Amoretti syrup\u2014you don\u2019t have to use it. You can use marsala (as is traditional) a little Kahlua, some brandy, godiva liqueur, a simple syrup with flavoring of your preference\u2014really, the options are wide open. When I make tiramisu, my personal favorite combination for the liquid is coffee, Tia Maria and marsala, but I\u2019ve also used dark rum and it\u2019s a great option too.  \n\n If you don\u2019t have or don\u2019t want to use marshmallow cream, you can make a **meringue** or a **7-minute icing** as a substitute that will taste pretty much the same. For tips on making your own 7-minute icing, check [this out]( https://www.browneyedbaker.com/7-minute-frosting/). \n\n\n",

I don't bother whipping over ice in my own cooking, but I do chill my bowl and whisk before I make whipped cream. \n\nBonus tip--the opposite is true with meringue. If you're making meringue, make sure your eggs are room temp and the bowl isn't too cold--you'll get better results. ",

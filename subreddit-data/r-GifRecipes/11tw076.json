Depending on locale, you can get them as appetizers alongside hard liquor since they're the perfect complement: salty, oily, meaty. The \"fishiness\" of anchovies is very mild, if you notice it at all, and in a sauce like this it's almost completely lost. The anchovies are really meant to provide some extra saltiness and to boost the savory flavor of the sauce. If you get proper bites of anything in particular, it's more likely to be the capers and the olives, not the anchovies.",

The taste was still still good.\n\nOther recipes that got criticized were the mac and cheese with blue cheese. I just love blue cheese. But got bombarded because the cheese had all set. Probably because the ratio of cheese vs cream was too high since when warmed up everything melted down again.\n\nSorry for the long rant. I tend to just start writing sometimes and sort of brain dump. But I'll just leave this here. I think its interesting \ud83d\ude01",

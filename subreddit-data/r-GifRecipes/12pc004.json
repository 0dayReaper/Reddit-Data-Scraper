Cut into chunky pieces. In a small jug or bowl whisk together the soy sauce, mirin, brown sugar, apple syrup, minced ginger and garlic. In a large mixing bowl mix together the cornstarch coating. Heat up enough oil to cover the base of your frypan. As the oil is heating, generously toss your tofu in the cornstarch mix to coat. Make sure oil is hot before you begin frying. Fry the tofu for a few minutes, flipping on each side so they become crispy all over then drain on some paper towel and set aside. Empty your pan of any excess oil and wipe down with some paper towel. Return pan to low heat and add your teriyaki sauce. In a small bowl mix dissolve cornstarch and water and add to the sauce, mixing until your sauce begins to thicken. Turn off the heat and add your tofu, tossing to coat in the sauce. Sprinkle with toasted sesame and garnish with spring onions. Serve with hot jasmine rice!\n\n[Source](https://www.instagram.com/p/CoYdJa4gUXi/)",

Deep fried tofu in black bean sauce is heavenly. Making tofu dishes at home may turn you off trying it.\n\nThe following simple recipes may help you get the most flavour and best 'mouth-feel':\n\n- Firm tofu: freezing the tofu first (and twice if you have patience) is best. Simply toss the tofu package in the freezer. After thawing and squeezing out the water, the tofu will grab all the flavours you give it. Freezing also makes the tofu tear apart like chicken. This \"deep fried chicken\" made with tofu tastes just like fried chicken. You can go the healthy route and bake it instead. Here's the recipe for fried 'chicken': https://www.marystestkitchen.com/best-vegan-fried-chicken-gluten-free/\n\n- Fresh tofu: I use this type of tofu to get close to the restaurant style tofu that is soft on the inside and crispy on the outside when fried. Here's the recipe to make these tofu puffs that you can throw into any recipe: https://avegtastefromatoz.com/how-to-make-tofu-puffs/.",

Flamboyant acting really isnt my thing and typically doesn\u2019t make me want to eat the food being presented, so I find it very silly. And I do see why a lot of people do like it. Especially in a soundless format like this; it shows a lot without over doing it. \nThank you for this answer!",

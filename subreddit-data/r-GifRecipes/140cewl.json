Chop tomatoes and mushrooms into cubes and keep aside.\n2.  To a pan, add olive oil and wait for it to heat up. Then add minced ginger paste, green chili and saut\u00e9. Slit the green chili so more of the flavor is absorbed into the oil.\n3.  Add diced tomatoes and saut\u00e9 for a minute.\n4.  Add garam masala, chili powder, turmeric, salt and black pepper. Saut\u00e9 for 5-10 until the spices fully cook and you see some oil floating at the top.\n5.  Add spinach and cook for a minute until it fully wilts. Let the mixture cool.\n6.  Meanwhile, cut up your tofu into cubes and fry them until crispy. You can also bake them at 200C for 15 minutes, flipping them halfway.\n7.  Add the spinach mixture to a blender and add coriander. Blend until smooth.\n8.  To the pan, add chopped mushrooms and saut\u00e9 until browned. Add the palak mixture and give it a good mix.\n9.  Add back in your fried tofu and coconut milk (save 2 tbsp of the thick portion for garnish later).\n10.  Add water if the mixture is too thick. Season with fenugreek leaves at the end and give it a final good mix.\n11.  Drizzle some coconut cream on top and serve with chapathi or basmati rice!\n\n[Source](https://browngirlveganeats.com/vegan-palak-paneer-with-fried-tofu/)",

He\u2019s a vet, beats up bad guys, and you can\u2019t see him. That\u2019s about all the character he has as a wrestler. However, he\u2019s practically the face of the wwe because he shows up to sign autographs, plays with kids in children\u2019s hospitals, stuff like that. So anytime you see the wwe logo on something, he probably shows up. ",

Although she said don't worry about calories (because if you are doing that, you probably arent going to have a problem w/ being in a caloric deficiency), I still watch them.  When I started, I thought \"how the fuck could i get by on 2000 cal. per day, even eating back calories from exercising.  Quickly realized it wasn't hard, and now I do under 1600 per day, and I don't eat back my calories.  I also am on the treadmill every day for 45 min to an hour.  My goal is to be at healthy BMI by mid-October, which will be 90 lbs total lost in basically 10 months.  In the meantime, I watch food-porn on GifRecipes.  :P       ",

This produces a sort of plasticy texture that melts in a way that's different to other cheeses.\n\nPersonally I find the stuff vile, but for a grilled cheese sandwich there's really no substitute. ",

It's basically just cheddar and colby that have been melted and reformed with practically no additives. It's technically a processed cheese, though when people say \"processed cheese\" they're typically referring to pasteurized process cheese food product, which contains up to half \"cheese ingredients\" but is mostly emulsified vegetable oils and stuff.",

Because you have not lived until you've put cheddar on a pan, fried it crispy, and consumed that little slice of heaven.\n\nOr better yet, made a chupaqueso, which is essentially frying a large amount of cheddar into a pseudo-tortilla then putting parmesan and jack (pepperjack even better) and possibly bacon bits into the middle and folding the cheddar around it. Careful though; the deliciousness can be quite a shock and you might literally die from ecstasy. \n\nMy dad introduced me to fried cheddar, but credit for the chupaqueso belongs to Howard Taylor.",

Which was 15 hours ago. I'm still awake. Also I'm very suddenly acutely aware of the reason *why* I don't drink copious amounts of caffeine.\n\n\nPro tip - don't do this if you're on ADHD meds because fuck all this caffeine has somehow counteracted the meds so now I have a shitton of energy and no focus.",

Once you have a paste, you add more hot water and whatever else. Normally I don't like sugar, but it works to balance the instant coffee flavor.\n\nIf you do this, the whipped coffee is quite strong, and will turn back into a liquid if it sits. That being said, you can put it in the fridge and have it over several days from my experience. \n\nI know it's adding sugar and using instant coffee, but once you get used to added sugar (and you can always use less), it's absolutely worth drinking, and packs a punch.",

            "comment": "Hi hi! Hope everyone is doing well. I've been working on a couple of recipes that are taking me a bit longer to churn out than I wanted (Sorry! But I will have some good pantry meals coming up very very soon!) so I figured in the mean time I'd put out something fun and fast to experiment with during the lockdown. My housemate insisted that I try this and it was surprisingly enjoyable!\n\n**Here's the recipe, from** [https://hostthetoast.com/whipped-coffee-dalgona-coffee/](https://hostthetoast.com/whipped-coffee-dalgona-coffee/)\n\n**(More details there on ingredients + method, if you're interested!)**\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n* 2 tablespoons instant coffee\n* 2 tablespoons granulated sugar\n* 2 tablespoons hot water\n* Ice, if desired\n* 1 cup milk of choice\n* Cocoa powder or cinnamon to top, optional\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the instant coffee, sugar and hot water. Using a hand mixer or [stand mixer](https://www.kitchenkapers.com/products/ankarsrum-original-mixer-akm-6230), whip until fluffy and toffee-colored, about 3-4 minutes.\n2. Add your ice to a tall glass, if desired, and then pour over your milk. Spoon the whipped coffee on top. The more whipped coffee you use, the stronger the drink will be. Sprinkle with cocoa powder or cinnamon, if desired.\n3. Using a spoon or straw, stir the coffee mixture into the milk before drinking.\n\n**Full Recipe &amp; Details:** [https://hostthetoast.com/whipped-coffee-dalgona-coffee/](https://hostthetoast.com/whipped-coffee-dalgona-coffee/)\n\n**Facebook:** [http://facebook.com/hostthetoast](http://facebook.com/hostthetoast)\n\n**Instagram:** [http://instagram.com/hostthetoast](http://instagram.com/hostthetoast)\n\n**x-posted from** /r/morganeisenberg",

When using both coffee and cocoa I used the following ratio: 2 TBSP instant coffee, 2 TBSP sugar, 2 TBSP hot water, and 1 TBSP  cocoa. It turned out great but it definitely took a longer time to get to a whipped consistency than it did when I made the recipe without cocoa powder - it did eventually become whipped, I just had to keep at it for probably twice as long (and definitely use an electric mixer!). \n\nI haven't tried it with just cocoa but I've read that you can do it in the same 1:1:1 ratio as you would with coffee - I don't think that it will whip up as good without the coffee but I've heard that using hot cream/milk instead of hot water can make it more likely to get that whipped consistency when you're using cocoa only. Hope this helps!",

I'd use the alcohol to replace the water in the recipe just to keep the liquid content low--there's something about the coffee crystals that makes it foam up, and you need that element to be as concentrated as possible.\n\nEdit:  Now that I think about it, if you used a coffee liqueur it *could* function as both the water and the sugar.  I generally have one around that's not rum-based (Monarch brand 'cuz it's local), but I'd be super curious to see if the high sugar content (and the type of sugar) in it would cause the mixture to work the same way.",

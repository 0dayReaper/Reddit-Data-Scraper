Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add the spinach and boil it for 30 seconds. Transfer to an ice bath and set aside.\n\n*Note: You can leave the water boiling, add salt, and reuse it for the pasta. However, if you notice any bits of grit in the water, I recommend dumping it and filling the pot back up with fresh water, and bringing it to a boil for the pasta.*\n\n**Saut\u00e9 the onions and garlic:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small pot over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10\u201312 minutes until very soft.\n2. Add the roughly chopped garlic and cook for 1 minute. Season with a pinch of salt and turn off the heat. Set aside.\n\n**Cook the pasta:**\n\n1. To the pot of boiling, salted water, add the pasta and cook until al dente. Scoop out 1 cup of the pasta cooking water and set aside.\n\n**Prepare the sauce:**\n\n1. Drain the spinach and squeeze out as much of the excess water as possible.\n2. Place the basil, parsley, pistachios, spinach, and lemon juice in a food processor or blender.  Pulse until finely minced. Add 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil and pulse again until incorporated.\n3. Add the mascarpone, cooked onions and garlic, and \u00bd cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano to the food processor along with a big pinch of salt. Pulse until smooth. Add half of the pasta water and continue blending until smooth. Transfer the sauce to a bowl.\n\n**Sauce the pasta:**\n\n1. Add the cooked pasta to the bowl of sauce. Toss to coat, adding more pasta cooking water as needed until the pasta is completely coated.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the pasta between shallow bowls. Garnish with the remaining grated parm and a few basil leaves. Finish each bowl with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil if you like. Enjoy!",

Otherwise similar style to saute onion and garlic which makes a delicious flavor, and then blending that with a spinach mixture similar to this recipe minus the parsley.  In Peru they serve this pasta with steak.",

The goal is to stop the cooking process, so if left in the heat with the onions, it\u2019ll continue to cook and you\u2019ll lose some of the brightness of the greens. If you\u2019re not super concerned with that, you can cook the spinach with the onions but do it right before adding to food processor and only saut\u00e9 until just BARELY wilted. You\u2019ll run the risk of it adding a little extra water to the sauce so adjust the amount of pasta water accordingly",

Stick the pasta back in the pasta pot with the sauce, turn the heat to medium low, and stir stir stir aggressively. It rubs all the gluten against itself and makes it all cohere together beautifully. This recipe looks great try this next time and the sauce will feel much more like \u201csauce\u201d that\u2019s actually thickly coating all the pasta.",

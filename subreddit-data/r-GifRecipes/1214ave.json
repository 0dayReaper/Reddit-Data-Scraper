            "comment": "hello! Wesley here. Today we\u2019re diving back into our series dedicated to Japanese classics with a Japanese breaded and fried pork cutlet, or \u201ctonkatsu.\u201d For those following along, not too long ago we did a pretty similar dish known as chicken katsu, which as you might guess, is the same dish, but made using a flattened and breaded chicken breast, in lieu of the pork cutlet. For our version today though, I thought I\u2019d use our tonkatsu as an excuse to take a shot at this fun cucumber salad that\u2019s been floating around the internet, made using Persian cucumbers. \n\nIt is for the most part a pretty straight forward cucumber salad with one unique attribute in the way that the cucumber is chopped, where a set of chopsticks are employed as a guide to create these fun cumber\u2026accordion shapes? Then finally we\u2019ll aslo be using a tried and katsu recipe to make these perfectly golden brown pork cutlets, amplified by my favorite secret ingredient, which is a pinch of dashi powder. Hope you try it. [**Follow the full video on youtube**](https://youtu.be/99xAavLWeXQ) for the whole story too!\n\n**Woo Can Cook** is a series where we reproduce fun foods and recipes from my childhood. Some of them are authentically Chinese and/or pan-Asian, but a lot of them are odd Americanized versions that I inherited from my parents and grandparents while growing up in the Bay Area/California.\n\n**Homebase** (Recipes, Livestream Schedule, Music and more): [Woo Can Cook](https://WooCanCook.com)\n\n**Recipes**: [Woo Can Cook (Youtube)](https://youtube.com/woocancook?sub_confirmation=1)\n\n**Music**: [Woo Cooks Beats (Lofi Beats to Cook to)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U-Rv35A1_Y&amp;list=PL72dM3fKnbHupDC0cIOHxaHBvjZLY3TdT&amp;index=19)\n\n**Woo Can Cook Fried Rice Pop Up (Every Thurs-Sun @ Wondrous Brewing!)**: https://WooCanCook.com/eats\n\n**TikTok** (short recipes and Woo Cooks Beats): [Woo Can Cook](https://www.tiktok.com/@woocancook)\n\n**Instagram** (pop-up schedule, music, and random doggo cameos): [@woocancook](https://instagram.com/WooCanCook)\n\n**RECIPE**\nhttps://woocancook.com/tonkatsu\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n- 4-5 pork cutlets\n- 4 cloves garlic\n- 1 inch (about 1 tbsp) ginger\n- 1/4 head cabbage\n- 4 Persian cucumbers\n- 1/2 cup AP flour\n- 1 cup panko breadcrumb\n- 2 eggs\n- kosher salt\n- 64oz fryer oil\n- peanut oil\n\n**INGREDIENTS (marinade)**\n- 4 tbsp low sodium soy sauce (or 2 tbsp full sodium soy sauce)\n- 2 tbsp rice vinegar\n- 2 tbsp red vinegar\n- 1 tbsp sesame oil\n- 1/2 tsp dashi powder\n\n**INGREDIENTS (tonkatsu sauce)**\n- 4 tbsp low sodium soy sauce (or 2 tbsp full sodium soy sauce)\n- 1 tbsp dark soy sauce\n- 1 tbsp mirin\n- 1 tbsp black vinegar\n- 1 tbsp oyster sauce\n- 1 tbsp ketchup\n\n**PREP**\n- CRUSH and mince the garlic, set aside\n- FINE MINCE the ginger, set aside\n- SLICE the cabbage, set aside\n- COMBINE all sauce ingredients, set aside\n- REMOVE the root and stem ends of the cucumbers, then place in-between two chopsticks, slice into strips, flip and repeat on the opposite side\n- ADD the cucumbers to a bowl and season with kosher salt, then let marinate for 10 minutes, and remove any excess water\n- COMBINE cucumbers with all marinade ingredients and set aside\n- TRIM the fat from the pork cutlets, then score and flatten with a mallet\n- WHISK the eggs, then place the panko and AP flour in separate bowls\n- DREDGE the cutlets in AP flour first, followed by egg, then panko\n\n**ON THE STOVE**\n- HEAT the fryer oil to 350F, then fry the cutlets until golden brown\n- REMOVE the fryer oil, reheat the wok as hot as possible, add 4 tbsp peanut oil and long yao\n- ADD the garlic and ginger, then bloom for 15 seconds until fragrant\n- ADD the sauce mixture and reduce over low heat for about 4-5 minutes until thickened\n- SLICE the tonkatsu cutlets into strips, then place on a bed of cabbage with a side of rice and cucumber salad",

Red vinegar comes from Chinese cooking, and is not too dissimilar from rice vinegar, but I find it has a little bit more brightness and sweetness than rice vinegar, which makes it excellent for recipes where the vinegar won\u2019t be cooked off at all (like a slaw, or a cucumber salad, for example). \n\nIn a pinch, I\u2019d definitely feel comfortable swapping it for plain rice vinegar tho, too. Let me know if u try this one!",

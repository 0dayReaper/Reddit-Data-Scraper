Keep in mind that you need the dough and butter slab to be of same consistency (we check the temperature between folds). \n\nTo be technical and paint a more elaborate picture, there are two leavening techniques at play: the yeast, and the moisture from the butter that evaporates. The evaporation is trapped between layers and layers of dough (and when the dough is properly mixed and the gluten is developed just right, the gluten strands will act as the walls that trap the gas)\n\nPuff pastry--sans yeast, and with flour containing less gluten protein--will create more flaky, crispy layers. \n\n \"easy\" croissants AND/OR cronuts ------v v v paradoxical ",

If used alone it would probably work but the result would be more cake like.  The puff pasty has no leavening but has more layers (often hundreds) and gives a more airy/flaky consistency.  If you are Julia Child you make your own puff pasty, but sane people buy it in the store ready made.",

A \"quick bread\" is something like cornbread, pancakes, biscuits, zucchini bread that you don't have to rest, knead, or rise. A yeast bread takes a lot longer, but rises from the CO2 the yeast gives off.\n\nI could be wrong, but canned biscuits are probably gross because of the the artificial butter flavor and preservatives, plus an old baking soda reaction--same thing happens when you let pancake batter sit for too long.",

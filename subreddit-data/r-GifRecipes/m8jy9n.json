If you have wet meat, the water on the surface has to cook off before browning starts.

The skin is insanely crispy.",

Cambodia has a special kind of black pepper they\u2019re known for and it\u2019s very difficult to find in the states. It defines the sauce in my opinion. Although, it does still taste good don\u2019t get me wrong. If you\u2019d like to find one or order it online, they\u2019re known as kampot peppercorns. The ginger is optional as far as I know as I didn\u2019t see it any restaurants and homes I visited and I did visit several cities across the country. I am not Cambodian however, and it sounds like the other posters are so it seems I maybe misremembering or it may be considered a different sauce. There is also sometimes sugar from the what the locals I asked said, albeit a small amount. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s goes well with nearly everything. It\u2019s absurd.\n\nEdit: can\u2019t seem to find a recipe with ginger in it, /u/kekehippo or /u/derpshit360 can you provide some insight? Is it personal preference or are the few recipes I found inaccurate? Also regarding the kampot pepper I personally felt it tasted very different without it but it could just be the difference in the limes or maybe the ginger I was missing. Do you feel like the peppercorn doesn\u2019t matter?",

I feel like all of these movie posts (without recipe) are just \u201chow I would want it\u201d recipes. \n\nI love the movie. Does it come with some recipe book I don\u2019t know about? \n\nAlso, not hating on the recipe at all, it looks phenomenal and I want to try it... just frustrated at calling it some food from som movie scene without some actual proof.",

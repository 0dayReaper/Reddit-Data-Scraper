            "comment": "hello! Hi everyone, Wesley here. Today we\u2019re diving back into our series dedicated to foods from TV and film with a shot at the \u201cSecret Ingredient Soup\u201d or \u201cNiu Rou Mian\u201d from Kung Fu Panda. A few technicalities to address right off the bat before people lose their minds here. First, the soup that we\u2019re making today is a Taiwanese beef noodle soup known as \u201cniu rou mian.\u201d I am well aware that Kung Fu Panda technically takes place in China (not Taiwan), but\u2026it also features a talking goose and a panda doing kung fu, so, I\u2019ll allow it. Second (and maybe more important), Mr. Ping\u2019s secret ingredient soup features a very light colored broth, indicating to me that it\u2019s probably a vegetable stock. I imagine this is because the alternative would be a soup made out of animal broth, which is\u2026pretty horrifying. \n\nSo! instead, today we\u2019re making the closest thing that I can think of to a secret ingredient vegetable soup broth, which is gonna be a tomato-based soup broth known as niu rou mian. As you may have put together, a niu rou mian is a soup of Taiwanese origin that prominently features beef shank, slow simmered with a combination of Chinese aromatic spices, chili paste, and shaoxing wine to create a deeply rich and aromatic soup. to pair with this, a niu rou mian also iconically features the use of (secret ingredient time) tomato as the source of its acidity, to yield its uniquely rich and acidic qualities. Hope you try it.

I have made this many times and love Taiwanese Beef Noodle soup, but it's a variation from a few online sources, do you have a reason not to boil the meat for a quick min, or could you think of a reason why it would be a good thing to do?",

As I understand, the parboil/rinse is to get rid of the impurities of the beef (I think I've more often seen this technique done in western soup recipes). Personally I haven't found it to be necessary with good quality beef, but it certainly can't hurt though...!",

Taste as you go, assuming its safe (not for cooking meats), learn what seasonings can do for you and how to get them most out of them, etc.\n\nAs an example, my mom occasionally makes a boxed wild rice dish for family events. Sure the box says 25 minutes to cook, but with her range and pots, that means there will be at least 1/2\" of water still in the pot. I've done the same rice on her set-up and it takes closer to 40 minutes. She can't seem to get past the directions telling her 25. \n\nTo be fair, I wasn't all that great of a cook until I took a cook job out of necessity. Wasn't my field, but damn I learned a lot.

Next throw them littles in their beaten future generations and coat with the GPS from Hansel &amp; Gretel.\n\nNow coat a skillet with Hot Bubble Butter(make sure you keep the Hot Bubble Butter Warm or it will just be bubble butter) and throw those chicken littles in for a few hours each side to crisp em up.\n\nFinally add those crispy littles to the Italian Water Soup that was chilling earlier, put some pre-made Cow Rice on top along with some sliced Melty Milk pads and burn the whole skillet in hell for one eternity. Congrats! You've now made Dead Chicken with Old Milk!\n\nUse as a side dish for pasta, chili or hot dogs or just a dish on its own, but be careful, they are as hot as an eternity in hell!",

I mean, you want one side that isn\u2019t wet, but I see it like pizza - if you have a good bottom crust and edges, the rest is as it should be with sauce then cheese. \n\nI think the bigger problem is that people don\u2019t pound the chicken to paper thin. Really, if you do that, you get nice firm pieces and lots of surface area. To sacrifice to sauce and cheese. I aim for 1/2\u201d or less. The result is a dry but good bite chicken - and because it\u2019s thin, the \u201cdry\u201d isn\u2019t like stringy nasty over boiled or roasted chicken. It\u2019s almost like pseudo jerky (sorta).

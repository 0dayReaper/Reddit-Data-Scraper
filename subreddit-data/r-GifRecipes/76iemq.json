I was more careful about folding the spread with the egg whites, and I did not use any butter or grease on the ramekins. They came out light and fluffy, and rose as the gif showed. By itself the flavor is subtle, but tasty, not too sweet, so I would recommend a sauce or compote. I served it with fresh sliced pears, apples and some cheese. \n\nAll voted to make them again, so I will make my modifications for the next round. ",

You can also add the whites in two parts which usually works better. Stop just after you stop seeing streaks. The egg whites look like they were hard peaks which looks like they were trying to emphasize when they took whisk out. Soft peak is when you remove the whisk and you get a Dairy Queen curl and hard peaks is like guy fierris  hair. It\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve been a pastry chef but this was hurting my feelings. Also when you fold just rotate the bowl a 1/4 turn each time and it helps you minimize the folding. ",

Water would be the easiest part, I guess, though I won't go into the water quality aspect. Flour would be a bit more difficult to get to, because it requires grinding up the grain and then not abandoning the concept just because flour on its own doesn't taste all that great. Once flour is invented, you need to have a way to make it actually tasty, or it will be considered a bad idea (because who grabs a bag of flour to munch on?). I have to assume something was found to fill that need, probably something like eggs? I don't know. Moving on.\n\nNow you get to the butter. Someone had to domesticate cattle, and then someone had to learn to milk them. Once the dairy arts advanced to the point of having enough milk to churn it, someone had to figure out how to do that. Most likely it was discovered by accident when a disgruntled dairy worker decided to take out his frustration on a crock of cow extract.\n\nThen comes the critical moment. This probably happened multiple times throughout history before someone progressed past the next step. \n\nSomeone, maybe the inventor, had to taste the butter. That person had to eat some butter, and rather than saying, \"Eww, this stuff tastes exactly like what it is,\" they had to say, \"Hmm, I wonder how this would taste with something else. Undoubtedly better...\"\n\nThen, assuming the inventor of butter also had access to finely ground wheat, they had to mix the two together with water, *and cook it*. They had to eat the bland wafer, and then they had to say, \"Hey, I bet this would make a great wrapper for something with more flavor! Maybe some juicy meats, or some pulverized fruit.\" And so they would probably start with something more like a Hot Pocket, but when that inevitably failed, they would settle on something vaguely resembling the classic pie shape we have today.\n\nIt probably took millennia to invent the pie.

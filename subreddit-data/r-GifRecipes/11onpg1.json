I could see why you would think so, as the tomato itself is a little pale - not surprising as tomatoes are out of season. The mayo will hold it fast to the toast. I do think the construction could use some work - I would put the meat and some cheese under the egg, as I think the egg+most of the cheese should be on top. Those little bits of meat will absolutely be coming off and onto my plate if I were to eat this.",

In a pan on medium to low heat fry chorizo strips until a red oil begins to render out.   \n2. Soak that oil up into the bread and place into the pan and toast on both sides. (Take note not to burn the chorizo if left in the pan while toasting the bread)  \n3. In the meantime put a small pot of water to boil and when boiling add some salt. Crack the egg open in a bowl. Get a spoon and stir the water from the outer edges slowly moving inward until a mini whirl pool forms. Immediately drop the egg into the water. Drop the egg in the water slowly in order to not separate the the yolk from the white. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes.  \nTIP. If you want the egg super runny, leave it around 2 or 3 minutes. Don\u2019t worry if the egg has threads of egg white swirling around in the water. That is normal.  \n4. Next, spread 1 teaspoon of Mayo on the toasted bread, add the sliced tomatoes and poached egg, sprinkle with the crunchy chorizo and grate some pecorino or parmesan.  \nSimple and tasty,   \nDon\u2019t worry if the poached egg doesn\u2019t look perfectly shaped like the ones you see in the photos. If it tastes good, who cares!!  \nThis recipe isn\u2019t on the website. I just wanted to share what I made for lunch.",

We like it caramelized on the meat here, a tribute to japanese \u201cyaki\u201d grilling. I never use more than 4 ingredients: soy, sugar, mirin, and sake. Keep spooning it over the meat in a cast iron until it\u2019s a nice glaze.\nNo hate on your recipe, but try basting your chicken before adding the veg to get that glaze next time.",

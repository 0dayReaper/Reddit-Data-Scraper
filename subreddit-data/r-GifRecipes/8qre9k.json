Some people use foil so the heat spread better, the fat inside melts and spreads inside the meat so the taste is intensified.\n\nIn Brazil the tradition on making BBQ is to use only rocksalt without any other ingredient so you have to play around with how the fat can increase the taste of the meat.",

This all depends on the cut of meat, as certain steaks (flank/skirt e.g.) do take well to marinades or sauces, like chimichurri. Other cuts of steak, such as the picanha, are amazing with only salt. \n\ntl;dr - People like different tastes. Most steaks (like the one in the video) don't need bold flavours added to them. All depends on cut.",

Is anyone here carving off that outer layer before eating it? I eat my steak by cutting it into chunks that have both the outer and inner areas. Because they taste better together. Depending on the cut of meat and the mood I am in, sometimes I like the extra umami that soy sauce brings. Or sometimes I WANT the extra sugar from a marinade to help create more of a crust during the searing. Taste is a matter of opinion, but using the argument that because marinades only really flavor the surface they aren't worth using it just factually incorrect. Unless of course you make a habit of cooking your steak, then carving off and discarding the outer layers.\n\nThis guy knows the science pretty well, but he is applying that info in silly ways.",

Butter contains milk solids that will blacken and char, helping your steak achieve a dark crust much faster and adding a characteristic slightly bitter, charred flavor. I happen to like this flavor (and it's typical of a steakhouse experience)\n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/2015/06/food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-steak.html",

But in relation to this post: using a searing hot cast iron skillet with butter is a total nightmare. I have to clean everything in a 1.5meter radius of my cooker. Including my over heat extraction fan. \n\nSo this is my question:\n\nIn any videos i see of professionals cooking steak, i never see this mess. Not even close. So, once i sear my steak, do i reduce the heat?",

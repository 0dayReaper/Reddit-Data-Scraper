Turn the heat on a skillet to medium-high. Add the pork and cook, breaking it up as it cooks, for 12\u201315 minutes until nicely browned. Continue cooking until the pork deepens in color and crisps up around the edges. You want crispy bits!\n2. Drain off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the skillet.\n3. Mix together 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine, and sugar. Pour the mixture into the pork. Bring to a boil and cook for 2\u20133 minutes, lifting up anything stuck to the bottom. Transfer the pork to a large bowl.\n\n#### Cook the noodles:\n\n1. While the pork browns, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Drain, rinse, and set aside.\n\n#### Cook the aromatics:\n\n1. Keep the heat on the skillet at medium-high. Add the shallot, garlic, ginger, Thai chili peppers, and minced scallions. Saut\u00e9 for 1\u20132 minutes until fragrant. Transfer to the bowl of pork.\n\n#### Cook the mushrooms:\n\n1. If needed, add a touch of oil. Add the mushrooms to the skillet and saut\u00e9 them for 5\u20136 minutes over medium-high heat. Be careful with shiitakes. They have a lower water content than other mushrooms and can dry out very quickly! Once lightly golden brown, transfer the mushrooms to the bowl of pork.\n\n#### Cook the cabbage and carrots:\n\n1. Add the cabbage and carrots (in batches, if needed) to the skillet. Saut\u00e9 over medium-high heat until the cabbage wilts and the carrots soften about 5\u20136 minutes. Season lightly with salt. Transfer the cabbage and carrots to the bowl of pork.\n\n#### Prepare the sauce:\n\n1. Add 2 teaspoons of sesame oil to the skillet. Add the XO sauce and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the water, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine. Bring to a boil for 1 minute. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.\n2. Scoop out a tablespoon or so of the sauce. Whisk it together with the cornstarch until a slurry forms.\n3. Return the cornstarch mixture to the sauce and stir to incorporate. Continue simmering for 3\u20135 minutes or until the sauce thickens. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed. If you like saucier noodles, add more water, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine in 3:1:1 proportions. You may need more cornstarch to thicken it if you add more liquid. You can also add more XO sauce for an even richer sauce.\n\n#### Finish the noodles:\n\n1. Add the noodles to the skillet along with all but a few tablespoons of the pork mixture. Toss to combine over low heat until the noodles are warmed through, about 45 seconds to 1 minute. Don\u2019t let them cook on the heat too long! Turn off the heat.\n\n#### To serve:\n\n1. Divide the noodles between shallow bowls. Spoon a bit more of the pork and veggie mixture on each dish. Garnish with thinly sliced scallions and crispy shallots if you like. Enjoy!",

It\u2019s seafoody but not fishy. Sweet, a little heat, salty and rich. It\u2019s indescribably good!\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever wanted to add a super umami-laden sauce to your fridge, make XO sauce your choice. The sauce\u2013birthed in Hong Kong in the 1980s\u2013is a fragrant marriage of chopped dried seafood, chilies, onions, and garlic. As you can see from the label, scallops play a big part in the flavor profile of XO sauce, lending a sweetness that creates a super complex sauce.\n\nThe high-end Hong Kong restaurant, Spring Moon, may have been the first to create this sauce. It was originally served as a complimentary condiment at their tables, but when customers began asking if they could buy it, they bottled it up and sold it.\n\nThe name XO Sauce comes from XO (extra-old) Cognac, though the sauce contains no cognac at all. It\u2019s also not really a sauce, as it\u2019s quite chunky and has a consistency similar to relish. XO Cognac\u2013a popular liquor in Hong Kong\u2013shortened to just XO was used to denote luxury and prestige, particularly in reference to the expensive ingredients used to make the sauce.\n\nWhile the name may be a bit of a misnomer with a touch of marketing ploy, XO sauce is divinely rich and well-deserving of the name that denotes such luxury.\n\nEven though scallops, fish, and shrimp are the base of this sauce, you need not limit yourself to using this with fish or seafood dishes. It pairs perfectly with chicken, beef, pork, or tofu.\u201d",

Personally, I don't have a wok because I'm still apartment living and the stoves I've had are not powerful enough to properly use a wok. I get better food doing batches in a skillet than I would in a wok, whether I was doing it in batches or not, because the heat wouldn't get all over the wok like it needs to.",

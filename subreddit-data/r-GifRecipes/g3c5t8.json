Don't let it sit there and dehydrate while you cook your broccoli for seven minutes. \n\nOthers have said to parcook/blanch the broccoli. In a professional setting this is what would happen to keep ticket times under ten minutes. If you are cooking at home, start the broccoli at high heat, cook on all sides and then deglaze with enough water for the broccoli to boil for one and a half minutes before cooking out.\n\nWhen cooking in a wok the heat should be on max, all the time, every time.

I recently bought a camper stove top to use just for Asian cooking and be able to properly use my wok at home.  \n I'm a professional chef so you got to be a little careful when you're doing it inside your house because it is open flame and you are playing with butane gas. Never leave the butane inside the cooktop after you're done using it because it will leak the gas out. They are pretty cheap, about $20-30 on Amazon.",

Do what the thing shows you and you'll come as close as possible, your experience/instinct takes over to close the gap. If you think it tastes good, congrats you just made food. If you don't, focus on what about it didn't work. Broccoli was soggy? Google soggy broccoli, or just experiment if you tend to be more of an autodidact. In the comments above they talk about using cold water after boiling which crisps them up. I would have never figured that out myself but others sure did. Meat is tough? Easy. Cook it less. Not flavorful? Easy. More seasoning and oil and stuff that you like.\n\nJust don't scorch or horribly undercook anything and it'll be edible so your failure can still feed you. Once you figure out your way, your success will feed you and make you feel really good about it. But you have to just do it eventually.",

It's a trick to chemical tenderize any cut of meat. It makes it softer. The same trick will also keep shrimp plumper. In both it will make the meat more tolerant to over cooking. A little bit on the outside will also help meat brown faster. It's a useful thing to have in the kitchen.",

Remoce broccoli.  \nAdd 2 tbsp more oil, let it come to smoke, and sear the beef to brown.\n\nWhen the beef is almost done add back in the broccoli and add the sauce and toss until sauce is reduced and looks thick and glossy, which should be pretty quick.\n\nIf you keep the pan as hot as possible at all times you'll get the best result.\n\nSource: Am professional cook.",

I dont recommend doing that. Often when cooking beef and broccoli stir fry you cook the sauce a little and then put in the meat and veggies that were previously cooked.",

The corn starch is first mixed well in cold liquid (often cold water), then the solution is added to the sauce in the pan and further cooked.\n\nThe gif doesn't do the sear/crust very well.",

It improves the mouth feel.  Usually, I just can't be bothered because a whole egg white is too muck for one drink and I don't often have more than one.  If I am planning more than one, I will make a shaker full, using the egg white, and split it into multiple drinks.",

In theory, heat in equals water out and the size of the cube, or surface to mass ratio, makes no difference.  But, experimentally, there is a difference, and that is because a larger number of smaller ice cubes set up more convection currents that serve to more efficiently transfer the thermal energy from outside the drink-ice system to inside the drink-ice system.\n\nhttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/wine/do-large-ice-cubes-yield-a-less-watery-cocktail/article578135/",

A splash of carbonated water if it\u2019s hot out.\n\nThe maple syrup ingredient looks really interesting, think I\u2019ll have to make one and report back...\n\nI wonder if honey would work... honey, lemon and rye would seem like a good trio.",

I'd honestly never heard of that variation until now.\n\nThe contrast of the musk of the Whiskey with the sweetness of the syrup or sugar is what makes me crave old fashions, though and it seems like Brandy would blend almost too seamlessly with the rest of the ingredients.  A Kentucky Mule is a close second.  But if you aren't a Whiskey / Bourbon / Scotch fan I could see why it would be off-putting.",

I took a cocktail class at a local distillery, and the instructor said that the term doesn't technically refer to a recipe using any particular base liquor. My guess is that this is why you see regional variation. Since then, I've become partial to the barrel-aged gin old fashioned, although I would probably only order that at a cocktail joint in whose expertise I trust. I do prefer the brandy variation over whiskey. I like the smoother mouth feel and more mellow flavor.",

The advantage is you know exactly how it tastes before the bitters and dilution from the ice occurs, so you can adjust from a nice base. \n\nFor me personally, I like a less sweet old fashioned so I use brown sugar in mine instead of syrup. \n\nThe beauty of the old fashioned is it is very forgiving, and everyone has their own twist.",

Whiskeys are already very sweet spirits, and while I won't say it's wrong to mix what is essentially two ounces of fruit juice into whiskey, I will say that it's not really reflective of what an old fashioned is supposed to be.",

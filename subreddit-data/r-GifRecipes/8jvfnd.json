Any other way you are wasting flavor and aroma. Also dont put garlic and onions at the same time, they have different cooking times. Also as a rule of thumb use vegetable oils for \"asian\" foods not butter. Also you have to remove the vegetables from the pan and add the meat, brown and then add back the vegetables. Also many other things...  you know what, I'm sorry to say it but this is just not a good recipe.",

Although the original point of a wok is indeed super high temp cooking, I still think a non-traditional wok (e.g. a non-stick wok) has merits. Its high capacity might be an advantage compare to a flat-bottomed frying pan. I also like them for sauces that I don't want to reduce too much, namely cream-based sauces. \nThey're also  useful for foods that reduce a lot. Spinach is a good example: you put a mountain of the stuff, and 30 seconds later, boom, nothing. A wok is great for that. \n\nAnd you can still maillard the shit out of meats, provided you use small enough batches. ",

I sometimes do protein in two stages for example.\n\nAt the end you put everything together and start adding seasonings and sauces.

I add onions, then garlic after the onions are slightly clarified. Usually by the time the whole dish is complete, the garlic has released its flavor, and is soft and tender.",

Wok frying is high heat frying, which means you need an oil with a high burn temp.  Olive oil and butter burn way too easily, so vegetable or peanut oil is best.\n\n- In a small bowl mix soy sauce and brown sugar and set aside\n\n- Add a small amount of vegetable/peanut oil (2 TBSP) to wok and heat it nice and hot.  If you don't know how hot it is, you can drop a tiny piece of meat in there and if it sizzles, you're ready to go\n\n- add garlic and cook until aromatic.  Usually only only takes a few seconds, but diced garlic burns fast so make sure you don't kill it.  \n\n- add meat to wok and brown.  Do not fully cook, just enough so there's no raw parts on the outside.  Then remove meat from wok with a slotted spoon to try and separate the oil from the meat as much as possible.\n\n- add a bit more oil if necessary, get nice and hot and add noodles.  They should be already cooked so you're just heating them at this point.\n\n- When noodles are hot, add meat back to the wok, and stir in the sauce.\n\n- Stir fry for about a minute\n\n- Turn off heat\n\n- Add spring onions and a bit of sesame oil (I usually just do a light drizzle over, probably not more than a TBSP) and mix briefly\n\n- Eat directly from wok, do not use bowls because there will be no need for leftovers and let's not wash more than we have to.\n\n\nFeel free to criticize this.  Some steps are weird.  I feel it's weird to just have garlic cooking with just noodles, so that's why I would do it with the meat, but pros can feel free to enlighten me here.  In general, a basic pattern to follow is:\n\nCook meat &gt; remove meat &gt; cook aromatics (garlic, ginger, onion, peppers) &gt; add vegetables &gt; add cooked meat &gt; add sauce &gt; cook together.

Some love it rare it's the texture some like myself prefer it more on the well done side but I personally cook my steaks for a long time and have never used a knife yet alone a steak knife to eat it, but each to their own I like my steak full of moisture like a rare but soft and succulent like a well done, so its a learning curve. \n\n\nExperiment with a decent moderate priced cut like sirloin (rump I think in the us) it's easy to cook and not mega expensive maybe $4/5 a cut watch some YouTube videos etc. \n\nGet decent SEA salt and pepper coat each side then add a dash of oil and cook it in a skillet slowly with a sprig of rosemary,  never try to cook it fast and always always let it rest before slicing generally around 8mins for a sirloin, if using a skillet I wouldn't go over medium or it might end up a bit chewy if you want well done see below.\n\n\nHow I do my well done steak. \n\nSalt pepper touch of chilli\nRapeseed oil in a pan which is oven proof with a lid. \nGarlic on a low heat to bring it into the oil\nBrown steaks on all sides \nAdd half an onion \nOnce onion is lightly browned add a half bottle of what ever red wine you can find (cheap is fine it's cooking wine) \nPlace in oven about 160C for 2 hours checking to ensure the wine doesn't dry out turn steak every now and then.\n\nEvery American is now cringing at me I know but trust me you will forever love it it's like a proper roast beef or smoked brisket texture but it's steak. \n\nServe with red wine roast potatoes and honey carrots \n\n\n\nWow that got long sorry lol \n\n\nI love steak and cooking :) enjoy!

People that make these want views and easy recipes with common ingredients and cookware travel further online. Unfortunately there is a lot wrong here. \n\nNon-stick woks are kind of an oxymoron. You should get the wok so hot that food doesn\u2019t stick (very long), and getting it that hot will damage the Teflon. The advantage to cooking in a wok is that it cooks very fast, so turning the heat down defeats the purpose. If you do use heat that high, you\u2019ll burn the butter before you can cook everything. \n\nThis looks really easy so I\u2019d only suggest a few changes so it stays that way. Get a carbon steel wok (don\u2019t worry, they are cheap), use vegetable oil (high smoke point and doesn\u2019t burn as easy), use the white part of the green onion, and skip the sugar (it will burn).

                            "comment": "I gotcha. So, whenever you bread anything, use one hand for dry ingredients, one for wet. So pick up the pork with your left hand and put it in the flour. Flip and coat using only that one hand (dry hand). Pick up the pork with that same left hand and place it in the egg mixture (without letting your left hand touch the egg.).\n\nThen use your other hand (right hand in this case) to pick up the pork and flip it, coating it in the egg. It's ok to get egg on that hand because it's only going to touch the egg mixture (wet hand).\n\nPick up the pork with the right/wet hand and place it in th3 breadcrumbs (without touching the breadcrumbs). It helps to use a big enough bowl so you can sorta place it on one side of the bottom of the bowl. Then take your dry hand and, without touching the wet egg/pork, grab some breadcrumbs in the bowl and sprinkle it on top of the pork. Then when you press them into the pork, you keep your hand pretty dry. You're only touching the panko, not the egg on the pork. Then flip the pork, and both sides should be mostly covered eniugh that while you finish coating you can avoid getting your dry hand wet. Finish coating with panko and set aside using dry hand on a plate.\n\nThen grab pork #2 with dry hand and place in flour, starting all over. One hand stays dry (only touches the pork at the beginning, floured pork, and panko). Other hand stays wet (only touches eggy pork).\n\nI think I explained that well enough. But this saves time, reduces hand washing, and keeps egg out of your flour and panko (and keeps panko out of your eggs). If you do multiple pork loins at once, things get messy.\n\nThere are also videos online to help you.  Also google \"seriouseats tonkatsu\" and they may explain wet hand/dry hand better in their recipe.\n\nHope this helps! It sure as heck helped me.",

Glad I could help.\n\nFyi, my three favorite recipe/cooking resources are Binging with Babish, Alton Brown, and seriouseats.\n\nBabish has a lot of fun videos where he remakes recipes (for better or worse) from tv shows. But he also has some instructional videos. \"Basics with Babish\" is great. He has a great method for making chicken quesadillas (I haven't tried the veggie or steak yet).\n\nAltoj Brown is just a great dedault source. He's fun in hiw videos, and his recipes are always solid. I use his \"all american beef taco\" recipe all the time.\n\nSeriouseats, specifically Kenji Lopez, is if you want to go all out and spend all day making the most delicious, amazing, complicated meal on the planet. It's going to be the ebst thing you've ever eaten, but it may cost twice as much in ingredients, take 10 hours of prep, and use every dish in the house. I'm half kidding. He alsi has some simple, easy recipes, like \"5 ingredient fried chicken sandwiches\" or \"three ingredient macaroni.\" But like I said, if you want to spend 12 hours making lasagna bolognese, he has the best freaking lasagne recipe on the planet. I make his jambalaya every couple months. It's not too crazy, but it's really good. Everyone on seriouseats is really good, but I tend to use Kenji Lopez's and Daniel Gritzer's recipes a lot.",

The other thing is utensils, using a metal spatula on a nonstick pan can scratch the coating and take away the non part of the nonstick. Using a plastic or wood spatula instead is usually better.  \n\nThis looks great though! Would never have guessed you were new to cooking if you hadn't said, that tonkatsu looks delicious",

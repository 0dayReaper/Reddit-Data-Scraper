Darker chocolate will add a deeper flavour profile that lends itself well to whatever nuts you want to add. Think traditional fondant.  \n\nIf non milk chocolate isn't your thing you can add bitterness through a few spoonfuls if espresso.  \n\n\n\n",

It's excellent as a bite accompanying a bitter black coffee (for sweetened coffee and or coffee with milk go with bitter chocolate).  \n\nAs a major flavour profile in desserts like this however  it's very bland.

I would rub butter on the Ramekins before sprinkling sugar on them, then add more when the mixture's poured in. That helps them rise by helping the mixture grip the sides. \n\nWhat's good to see is the mixture being added in two parts, just yeah, it needs to be gently folded. I would mix for longer too, get as much air in as possible. \n\nThe best results from a recipe I've had was from a recipe from Jamie Oliver's sit.

When the egg whites were added to the batter, the person in the gif simply stirred them in as opposed to gently folding them into the batter. This deflates  the egg whites and causes all that introduced air to become deflated as whisking \u201cpops\u201d the airy pockets introduced by the egg whites, producing a less airy souffle and also meaning the person in the gif wasted their time whipping the egg whites considering they whisked most of the air out anyway.",

Gentle movements. Mix in a little at a time. Your first scoop of egg white will get deflated a bit because the rest of the batter is still heavy in comparison. That's why you do it in batches so the ones after that are introduced into a lighter, airier batter that won't deflate your egg whites. \n\nThere's not much of a technique to it, I'd recommend going to YouTube and just watching someone from a random baking channel make souffl\u00e9 or mousse or something. As long as it's gentle it's fine. ",

This extra air is wanted for your confection, like the souffl\u00e9 in the gif, to rise properly. In the gif, the person just stirs everything together, which doesn't allow air to move between all the good stuff, so there is no way they got a good rise out of it.\n\nProbably not no way, but it'd be pretty rare.",

These bubbles are what make the batter rise in the oven when cooked so its important that you treat the egg whites gently as to not pop the bubbles.  This is why recipes always say \"fold in the egg whites\" as folding is a specific mixing technique that's meant to be gentle.  \n\nIn the gif he stirs the fuck out of the egg whites after he adds them to the nutella which would pop all the bubbles and generally mean that his batter wouldn't be expected to rise very well in the oven.",

Instead of sugar, used maple syrup, but didn't seem to adjust for the extra liquid, so I had to bake them twice as long to just evaporate moisture and that still didn't work well.\n\nThe result was this dense blob of carbs that has little flavour.\n\nNever again, tasty.",

Went to get a new bottle recently after finishing my last one and couldn't find a single one anywhere. I've been looking for weeks now :( I've been using a black bean sauce as a substitute that hasn't been too bad. Helps to add an umami flavour with a bit of a... almost funky kinda flavour? No idea, I think it's made through some kinda fermentation though.",

You're probably better just leaving it out, substituting ginger will not be bad but will change the flavour of the dish. Ginger isn't really a Thai ingredient.\n\nWhen I'm not able to get the fresh stuff I get the jarred paste online which I find tastes fine. I've heard the powdered stuff is pretty good too. It freezes really well so when I am able to get it I buy loads at once.\n\nEdit: oh, and its taste is really hard to describe. Kind of citrusy and medicinal but it's not spicy or sour. Kind of like an air freshener but in a good way \ud83d\ude05. It's one of my favourite ingredients, it's very refreshing.",

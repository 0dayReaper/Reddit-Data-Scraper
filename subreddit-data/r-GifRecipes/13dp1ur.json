Preheat oven to 350F (convection bake 325F). Line 2x cupcake pans with paper liners. Set aside.\n2. In a small bowl, whisk flour and corn starch to aerate.\n3. In a large bowl with an electric mixer, or in the bowl of a stand mixer, combine butter, oil, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix on low speed to combine and gradually increase speed to medium, mixing until butter mixture looks light in colour and creamy. Scrape down sides of bowl.\n4. Add egg whites, one at a time, to mixture. Incorporating well after each addition. Add vanilla extract. \u00a0\n5. In small bowl or mixing cup, combine sour cream with champagne. Mix until homogenous.\n6. Reduce speed of stand/electric mixture to low and slowly add 1/3 of flour mixture. Then add 1/2 of sour cream/champagne mixture. Repeat flour and liquid steps, finishing with addition of the flour mixture. Scrape down bowl and mix one final time. Scoop 1/4 cup of batter into each cupcake liner.\n7. Bake cupcakes for 22-25 mins or until toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean. Let cupcakes cool on wire rack.\n\nFilling (champagne pastry cream)\n\n1. In a saucepan, heat heavy cream and champagne. Bring to a gentle boil.\u00a0Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk sugar, egg yolks, and cornstarch. Whisk until mixture is creamy, pale, and smooth.\u00a0\n2. Slowly pour all of the boiled liquid into the mixing bowl with the eggs, while vigorously mixing.\u00a0Transfer mixing bowl contents back to the saucepan.\u00a0Continue to heat mixture on medium-low heat until thickened, whisking often to prevent lumps from forming.\n3. Remove cream from the heat. Add butter and whisk until melted.\u00a0Add a pinch of salt and vanilla. Cover surface with plastic wrap (to prevent skin from forming) and let cool completely.\n4. Cut a hole out of the centre of each cupcake. Remove cupcake lid and fill with 1 teaspoon of custard. Add the top of each cupcake lid back to the cupcake. Continue to make buttercream.\n\nChampagne Buttercream\n\n1. In a small saucepan/pot, bring champagne to a boil. Swirl mixture occasionally while allowing the champagne to reduce. The mixture is ready when it has reduced to approximately 2-3 tablespoons. (note: DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE POT! This mixture can burn quickly if left unattended)\n2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream butter on medium speed.\n3. Reduce speed to low and slowly add powdered sugar to the butter. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as you go.\n4. Once all powdered sugar has been incorporated, add the reduced champagne. Continue to mix the icing on medium speed until fluffy. If the mixture is stiffer than your liking, add 1-2 tbsp of heavy cream and continue to mix.\n5. Put frosting in a piping bag with your favourite star piping tip and decorate each filled cupcake. Decorate with sprinkles and enjoy!",

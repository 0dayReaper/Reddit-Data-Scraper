            "comment": "hello! Hi everyone, Wesley here. Today we\u2019re diving back into our series dedicated to deconstructing Americanized Chinese cuisine with a shot at the crab wontons or \u201cCrab Rangoon,\u201d from PF Chang\u2019s. For those new to the channel, in this series, we have been deconstructing iconically Americanized dishes from Chinese cuisine, and seeing what it might look like if we were to cook the dish through the lens of more traditional Chinese wok cooking. For those unfamiliar, crab rangoon is a wonton dumpling dish commonly found in American Chinese cuisine on the small bites menu which features a cream cheese and crab based filling, that is deep-fried for a crispy finish. Since wonton wrappers contain egg, they then puff up and blister very nicely in a deep-fry, not unlike an eggroll (some may know that a wonton wrapper is essentially just an eggroll wrapper, cut into a smaller shape). \n\nCrab Rangoon, not unlike a number of other American Chinese dishes like Mongolian Beef and Singapore Street Noodles, actually has no real affiliation with Rangoon, (which is the capital of a region in Myanmar or Burma), and in fact was invented here in the states. So, I will preface this all by saying that there really is only so much that we can do with a dish that contains cream cheese, which is just about the most American thing that you can fit into a dish. For our version today though we\u2019re going to be drawing some inspiration from a few of my favorite more traditional Chinese dumpling recipes that we\u2019ve done in the last few years, and include a number of aromatic veggies and spices to bring our wontons to life, this today will be some white pepper, chili crisp oil, and baby bok choy, in lieu of the bell pepper that the PF Chang\u2019s version calls for. Hope you try it. [**Follow the full video on youtube**](https://youtu.be/82TmrDfAWxQ) for the whole story too!\n\n**Woo Can Cook** is a series where we reproduce fun foods and recipes from my childhood. Some of them are authentically Chinese and/or pan-Asian, but a lot of them are odd Americanized versions that I inherited from my parents and grandparents while growing up in the Bay Area/California.\n\n**Homebase** (Recipes, Livestream Schedule, Music and more): [Woo Can Cook](https://WooCanCook.com)\n\n**Recipes**: [Woo Can Cook (Youtube)](https://youtube.com/woocancook?sub_confirmation=1)\n\n**Music**: [Woo Cooks Beats (Lofi Beats to Cook to)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9McCfCIkWtc&amp;list=PL72dM3fKnbHupDC0cIOHxaHBvjZLY3TdT&amp;index=13)\n\n**Woo Can Cook Fried Rice Pop Up (Every Thurs-Sun @ Wondrous Brewing!)**: https://WooCanCook.com/eats\n\n**TikTok** (short recipes and Woo Cooks Beats): [Woo Can Cook](https://www.tiktok.com/@woocancook)\n\n**Instagram** (pop-up schedule, music, and random doggo cameos): [@woocancook](https://instagram.com/WooCanCook)\n\n**RECIPE**\nhttps://woocancook.com/crab-rangoon\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n- 50 wonton wrappers\n- 64 oz fryer oil\n- sweet chili sauce\n\n**INGREDIENTS (filling)**\n- 4 cloves garlic\n- 1 inch (about 1 tbsp) ginger\n- 3 green onions\n- 4 heads baby bok choy\n- 6 oz cream cheese\n- 8 oz crab meat (claw or lump)\n- 4 tbsp low sodium soy sauce (or 2 tbsp full sodium soy sauce)\n- 1 tbsp sesame oil\n- 1/2 tsp white pepper\n- 1 tbsp white sugar\n- 1 tbsp shaoxing wine\n- 1 tbsp red vinegar\n- 1 tbsp chili crisp oil\n\n**PREP**\n- CRUSH and mince the garlic, set aside\n- FINE MINCE the ginger, set aside\n- SLICE the green onions thinly, set aside\n- DICE the baby bok choy, set aside\n- COMBINE all filling ingredients and mix until a smooth texture forms\n- LAYOUT 12 wonton wrappers at a time, then spoon 1/2 a tbsp of filling onto each, and wet the corners of the wrappers with water\n- FOLD the wonton over into a rectangle and press to seal\n- HOLD the center of the fold between your ring and middle finger, then use your thumb and pointer fingers to pinch the corners shut\n\n**ON THE STOVE**\n- HEAT the frying oil to 350F\n- FRY the wontons for 5 minutes until golden brown, then remove to a dry rack to cool\n- SERVE with a side of sweet chili sauce",

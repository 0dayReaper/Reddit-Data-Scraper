To summarize, there are two different kinds of textures you can get from freezing tofu, and it largely depends on the brand/how the tofu was made. \n  \nOne is flaky which it looks like what they had in this gif and makes a better chicken like texture. The other is spongy which imo is better in some recipes than others. I'm more of a fan of it for stir fry, but try to find both types and see what you like in what recipes.\n  \nhttps://youtu.be/ZTEo11NY9EY",

I would have zero problem with the latter.\n\nI would disagree with this being recognizable to Koreans, though. I don't know about you, but fried tofu is much more associated with *soy sauce* than gochujang in my experience, and I don't know if Koreans would even bother *breading* tofu. This just seems like a vegetarian attempt at making Korean fried chicken, without realizing that many forms of kimchi probably not being vegetarian (because of the fish sauce/essence). \n\nThat said, you are right in that my previous example was probably not the best to make my point.",

Slice the tofu in half lengthways then cut each half into 4 fingers and place into a mixing bowl\n2.  Add the cornflour and a good pinch of salt and pepper\n3.  Toss (or stir) to completely coat the tofu pieces\n\n**Cook the tofu**\n\n1.  Warm 1cm of vegetable oil in a pan over a medium heat until the end of a wooden spoon bubbles gently\n2.  Once warm enough, add the coated tofu chunks to the pan and fry, turning constantly with tongs until golden and really crispy (approx 10 mins)\n3.  Once cooked, transfer the tofu pieces to the plate and leave to drain\n\n**Make the sauce**\n\n1.  Place a small frying pan over a medium heat and pour in your sesame oil\n2.  Once it's warm, stir in the gochujang paste followed by the soy sauce, agave, tomato paste, sesame seeds, water, brown sugar and juice of a lime\n3.

Melt the plant-based butter in a saucepan then add the jasmine rice and toast in the butter for a minute\n2.  Before it starts to brown, add the water and stir the rice bringing it to the boil\n3.  Once boiling, turn down the heat to a simmer and cook until all the water is absorbed\n4.  If the rice is still hard, add a little more water until cooked\n5.  Finally chop the spring onions and stir through your rice along with the kimchi - keeping some for the top\n\n**Time to serve**\n\n1.  Grab your crispy tofu pieces and pop them into a large bowl\n2.

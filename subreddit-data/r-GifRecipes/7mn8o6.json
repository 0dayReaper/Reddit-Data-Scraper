Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F / 200\u00b0C.\n1.     In a medium pot of salted boiling water, cook the elbow macaroni until it\u2019s just shy of al dente, about 5 minutes (or 2 minutes less than the cooking time listed on the package). Drain the pasta and transfer it to a large mixing bowl.\n1.     Toss the pasta with 1 tablespoon of the butter, until the butter is melted and the pasta is evenly coated. Set aside.\n1.     In a large saucepan, melt 1\u00bd tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and stir to form a paste. Cook, stirring continuously, for about 1 minute or until the flour is lightly cooked.\n1.     Whisk in about half of the milk to form a thick paste. (Make sure to get into all corners of the pan while mixing as the paste tends to stick.) Add the remaining milk to the pan and mix it well to combine. The sauce will initially become very thick, then it will thin out once all of the milk is added. Cook, stirring often, until the sauce comes to a simmer and begins to thicken again. Turn off the heat and, working in increments, whisk in the cheddar cheese until it forms a smooth cheese sauce.\n1.     Whisk in the garlic powder, paprika, hot sauce, and mustard or mustard powder. Taste the sauce and season it with salt, if necessary.\n1.     Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and mix to combine. Transfer the macaroni and cheese mixture to a greased 8-inch baking dish and stir in the grated Gruyere cheese.\n1.     In a small mixing bowl, add the crushed butter crackers or panko bread crumbs and 1\u00bd tablespoons of melted butter. Mix well to combine. (If using panko bread crumbs, you may want to season them with a little salt.) Top the surface of the mac and cheese with the buttered bread crumbs.\n1.     Bake for 25 \u2013 30 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and the top is nicely browned. Let the mac &amp; cheese cool for 5 \u2013 10 minutes before serving. Leftovers can be refrigerated for up to 5 days.",

I work as a professional cook, and we use it to keep things emulsified, it helps prevent the grittiness and the separation that always inevitably comes with cheese sauces.  Sodium citrate is the answer to american cheese/velveeta always keeping their silky smooth texture.  Just add about a tablespoon to your sauce when making the base (when you add the milk) and dissolve it in, its tasteless, it will work wonders for you.",

The preserving powder in pre-shredded cheese is to *prevent* it from melting together. It makes sauces have a weird texture, it\u2019s not smooth. Grate it yourself!\n\n-have made a lot of mac and cheese before.",

Then I just checked it every 5 minutes to give the strips/wings a shake until done. Since this is a larger piece of meat, a meat thermometer may be good. Both times I sprayed oil on the basket and meat, lightly, to help prevent sticking.\n\nBoth turned out amazing. This may be my next chicken recipe to try with it.",

If it increases risk of a specific type of already rare cancer by like 2% then that means that if the original type of cancer even had a 20% chance to develop over your entire lifetime, the chance has now risen to 0.204%, an increase of 0.004%.\n\nA lot of the \"Increases risk of cancer\" are true but also scaremongering. That might not be the case with this but it all depends on the studies and stats.",

It's what they use and Hot Sauce is a bit generic if you are trying to match the flavour profile of popeyes. Frank's for instance wouldn't work!\n\nUse the brioche bun, it's sweeter and holds up better against the Mayo.\n\nThe gif shows hot suace going into the marinade, the recipe doesn't. Put hot sauce in the marinade, this recipe as it stands is not spicy enough.\n\nMarinate the chicken at least overnight. Use breast meat and a thick cut, no need to bash it down as shown, the buttermilk will penetrate just fine.\n\nThe REAL key to this breading is adding a dash of the marinade to the breading first! This step is crucial and gives you those little spicy crunchy ripples that just nom nom nom.. \n\nI found the breading didn't stick to the chicken enough. If done again I would reserve some breading, pat the chicken down with paper towel and redunk in the marinade before going into the final breading.\n\nFinally the spices in this are all pretty standard copy cat recipes for KFC, I didn't really find anything unique in here that hasn't featured before... Its still tastes amazing and since I live in Australia and don't get to enjoy this anywhere near as often as I should it's worth doing it properly",

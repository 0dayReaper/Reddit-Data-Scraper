Also, unless you have an industrial supplier you aren\u2019t getting anything more concentrated than 3% H2O2 (again, *in water*), which FYI decomposes to form simple O2 which doesn\u2019t react with the base either. If you did heat it, it gets a little bit fizzy, so I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201cthermally incompatible\u201d, it just breaks down slightly faster at warmer temps.",

In fact, if you soak a cast iron pan in plain water it will rust, so that shouldn't be surprising.\n\nParent is talking about de-rusting cast iron that needs rehabilitation.  Rust is much more soluble in acidic solution than in water, so it really helps if you can add vinegar/citric acid/whatever to your scrubbing efforts.\n\nYou can also clean cast iron with dish soap without any problems.  Soap was once commonly made from lye, which will strip the seasoning off (also sometimes useful).  And in other myths, you can use a brillow pad or scotch-brite if you want.  You may need to do quick re-seasons more often, but it's not like with teflon where it's permanently damaged and also carcinogenic.",

Then scrape the salt up with a wooden spoon and dump the salt in the trash when it cools. \n\nBeautifully clean every time with 0 damage to your seasoning. Just remember to give it a very light oil rub when you're done to help continue the seasoning",

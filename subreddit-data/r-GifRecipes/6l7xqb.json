It started with that \"British desserts piece of bullshit, then one of them decided to fuck up chips with curry sauce, and earlier today they had a (some boxed shit) inspired macaroni cheese, which was pretty identical to the recipe that has been in the UK for about 500 years. In the last couple months too they have tried to rename pavlova and I am sure there are loads I am missing. I am starting to think that they deliberately mis-name things just so the comments get filled up with people calling them out on it so it bumps them up towards the front page",

                            "comment": "British food went through a fairly terrible period post-war, at the height of industrialisation. Tons of it was tinned, frozen, dried etc, and pretty bland due to rationing which lasted until 1954, far longer than I think most Americans realise. I'm not even joking when I say that strict government control of cheese production meant we didn't get 'fancy' cheeses until well into the 80s and even 90s. The war hit us really hard.\n\nThat said, both before and after this period, British cuisine has been surprisingly good. Obviously these days we have a wealth of TV chefs, michelin star restaurants and a healthy trend of quality cooking, but even before the world wars British cuisine was dominated by the upper class and gentry. You think of 'historical' British food and you picture lavish banquets, game hunting, spices and foods imported from all over the empire, etc. I don't think anyone would suggest British food was bad 200+ years ago.\n\nWe just happen to be alive at the end of a bad patch, sadly.",

            "comment": "Scotch eggs. You DONT need the flour on the egg or the flour and egg bath on the sausage. Sausage meat is sticky enough. Also you can oven bake them rather than deep fry.\n\nFor medium eggs you need about 1 and a half sausages (UK stand sausages, sorry don't know if USA ones are different). I think it's bake at 180 degrees C for 30-40 mins. Just going by memory of the recipe my mum gave me. I can look it up if anyone wants.\n\nAlso don't add the spring onions. Urg! Just get herby sausages. \n\n\nEdit: \n\nOk, here it my mum's scotch egg recipe. It is incredibly simple! Turns out I got the number of sausages wrong whoops! Tbh you just need enough that it covers the egg nicely.\n\n- Hard boil your eggs and peel (easier to peel when still a little warm)\n- Take the meat of 2 sausages out of the skins per egg.\n- Flatten the meat (with your hands) and wrap it around the egg, so it is completely sealed.\n- Roll in breadcrumbs \n- Bake at 180\u00b0C for 30-40 minutes.\n- Enjoy hot or cold.\n\nIf you find the meat sticks to your hands too much, dampen your hands with a little water. Not too much or everything will just end up slimy!\n\n \n\nEdit 2:\n\nGiven it was written down in the same place, here is my mum's basic cake/bun recipe\n\nBasic cakes have a standard ratio of ingredients, so you can easily adjust the amount of mix. You'll need equal measures of butter, sugar, flour and eggs. 4 eggs makes a dozen buns or one flat cake.\n\n- Choose how many eggs you want, then weigh them. That's how much each of your butter, flour and sugar you will need to weigh out. (Note you need self raising flour. I used plain once, it did not go well. For the sugar I think granulated or caster sugar should be fine, I didn't note down which sorry!) \n\n- Mix the sugar and butter until white and fluffy. (I use an electric beater for this)\n\n- Add the egg and flour one egg and one tablespoon of flour at a time, mixing (using the beater) before adding more. I find it easiest to sift the flour at this point, directly into the mix. When you run out of eggs, gradually add the remaining flour.\n\nThat's the basic mix done!\n\n\nIf you want chocolate cake: mix cocoapowder with a little water and add after the butter and sugar are mixed. Reduce the flour accordingly.\n\nIf you want coffee cake: mix coffee with a little water and add to the sugar and butter gradually.\n\nShe didn't tell me how much coffee or cocoapowder sorry! You don't need much from what I remember, but hey now you get a chance to experiment! This recipe is great for that.\n\nIf you want bits: Add walnuts (for coffee and walnut) or chocolate drops at the end.\n\n\nBake at 180\u00b0C. 20 minutes for buns, 30 minutes for cakes.\n\nHopefully that makes sense. It's quite a flexible recipe. If you find the mix to too wet after adding the coffee or cocoapowder you can just add a little more flour. I've found this isn't really needed though, so long as you don't use too much water! You just need enough to turn the coffee or cocoapowder into a liquid so it mixes in nicely.    ",

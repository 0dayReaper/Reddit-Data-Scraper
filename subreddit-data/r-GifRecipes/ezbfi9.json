                    "comment": "Sorry for the delay! I thought I already answered this one but I must have missed it.\n\n# Why all the oil? I'll tell ya!\n\nFirst things first, there is actually less oil used than there appears to be in the video. It's a lighting thing from overhead. HOWEVER, there is still more oil than you probably are used to cooking your steaks in. Here's why--\n\nIf you want a steak that tastes like it was cooked at a fancy restaurant, the secret is fat. Reason 1) Extra fat = extra flavor. People have no idea how much butter and oil is used in your average restaurant dish, but it's a lot. Fat and lots of salt are basically the two reasons why everything tastes so good when you eat out vs. when you try to make a dish at home.\n\nReason 2) The extra oil also results in a better seared crust. Basically, you're distributing the heat so that it even goes up into the nooks and crannies, or parts that are raised up a bit when you have the steak \"contacting\" the bottom of the pan. Because remember, no matter how even your steak looks, there will be some parts that are slightly thicker or thinner. Especially after the steak starts to cook. \n\nReason 3) It prevents burning and sticking. Have you ever tried to make a steak in a cast iron skillet, put a tiny bit of oil in, got that baby smoking hot, and then had your steak basically cement itself to the pan once you added it? Then when you try to flip, you've ripped off the part of the steak that would have been the crust, and it's now sitting at the bottom of your pan, doing nothing but burning? If so, this prevents that.\n\nReason 4) The oil prevents the butter from burning during the beginning of the basting step. Because the cast iron skillet retains heat, it will still be pretty hot after you turn the heat down. Add your butter and it will burn immediately. Again, the oil serves as a sort of barrier here between the newly added butter and the cast iron.\n\nReason 5) You need additional oil for the frying of the potatoes and cooking of the asparagus anyway.\n\nAnd yeah, that's about it. You can use less, but you'll have better results if you don't try to skimp.",

If you\u2019re just dumping the fond down the drain or whatever, sure, but if you minimize your oil and rely on butter for basting, you get more flavor and more useful drippings should you choose to make a sauce afterwards.

I also no longer cook scrambled eggs in my skillets because they crust up and have fucked me over several times. On the flip side, I have no problems cooking an omelette in one.\n\nBought the #8 pans for $5 at a flea market, stripped, and reseasoned myself a few times. r/castiron is great.",

It's pretty cool that I can now find a jackfruit at most Shoprights, etc.\n\n \nWe often use it as a curry when unripe because it has a more meaty texture and is slightly more sour. We call it [Polos](https://www.islandsmile.org/sri-lankan-green-jack-fruit-curry-polos/). When its ripe,like in the video above we eat it raw, because it's very sweet. I have no idea how it would taste with bbq sauce on it but it's more of a desert in that stage of its life. That said its cool to see how it's being changed and modified into crazy new  combinations. If you haven't tried it, please give it a shot if you come across some!",

It's a really great skillet-- evenly heats and retains heat well, makes it easy to pour off excess grease due to the corners acting like little spouts, and my personal favorite part is that the surface is pretty smooth (not pebbly like most cast iron) so stuff doesn't stick. It's so easy to clean. I'm in love with mine.  \n\nSo I'd say the top 2 reasons are that it's beautiful and also just generally really effective, but it's not a \"must\" over a different cast iron skillet. \n\n[This](https://www.kitchenkapers.com/products/finex-cast-iron-skillet-with-lid) is the one I have, but I don't own the lid. I got mine for free from a vendor event. At the time I wouldn't have purchased it (they are expensive and I'm not someone who splurges on cookware usually) but now that I know how much I love mine, I would.",

            "comment": " You might recognize this recipe-- I posted it about a year ago, but had it weirdly sped up because I didn't know how to upload longer gifs yet. With Valentine's Day coming up, I decided it would be a good time to upload the not-ridiculously-fast version. This method of making steak is my go-to! So easy and really amazingly delicious. That being said, I'm also going to be experimenting with sous vide steak later this week, so I'm excited to see if that method will become my new favorite, or if this pan-fried garlic butter steak will still reign as champion.\n\n**ANYWAY, Here's the recipe, from** [https://hostthetoast.com/pan-fried-garlic-butter-steak-with-crispy-potatoes-and-asparagus/](https://hostthetoast.com/pan-fried-garlic-butter-steak-with-crispy-potatoes-and-asparagus/) (**more details there on ingredients + method, if you're interested!)**\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n* 1 pound small potatoes, halved\n* 1 (1.5\u201d-2\u201d thick) ribeye steak\n* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil\n* 4 tablespoons butter\n* 2 sprigs rosemary\n* 2 sprigs thyme\n* 8 cloves garlic, peeled\n* 8 ounces fresh asparagus, trimmed\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Add the potatoes to a medium-sized pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and continue to cook until the potatoes are tender, about 6-8 minutes. Drain the potatoes and set aside.\n2. Season the steak generously all over with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large cast iron skillet over high heat until beginning to smoke. Add the steak to the skillet and cook, flipping every 30 seconds or so for a total of 4 minutes, or until a brown crust forms. Sear the sides as well.\n3. Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter, garlic, and herb sprigs. Once the butter has melted, tilt the pan slightly so that the butter collects by the handle and use a spoon to splash the steak with the hot butter. Continue to baste, flipping the steak occasionally, until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the steak registers 120-125\u00b0F for medium rare, or 125-130\u00b0F for medium (about 3-4 more minutes). Set the steak aside to rest.\n4. Meanwhile, place the potatoes back into the skillet, cut-side-down. Make space for asparagus in the center of the skillet and add it. Cook, tossing the asparagus occasionally (but leaving the potatoes undisturbed) until the asparagus is just tender, about 6 minutes. Remove the asparagus and set aside on a serving plate. Continue to cook the potatoes until golden, about 2 more minutes. Set aside with the asparagus.\n5. Slice the steak, if desired, and serve with the potatoes and asparagus.\n\n**Full Recipe &amp; Details:** [https://hostthetoast.com/pan-fried-garlic-butter-steak-with-crispy-potatoes-and-asparagus/](https://hostthetoast.com/pan-fried-garlic-butter-steak-with-crispy-potatoes-and-asparagus/)\n\n**Facebook:** [http://facebook.com/hostthetoast](http://facebook.com/hostthetoast)\n\n**Instagram:** [http://instagram.com/hostthetoast](http://instagram.com/hostthetoast)\n\n**x-posted from** r/Morganeisenberg",

However, if I quickly tilt the pan (so it's not sitting on the burner) and splash the butter (so air is being introduced frequently), it prevents that issue for the most part. That being said, different stoves really are significantly different, so your pan might be getting a bit too hot or staying too hot at medium heat. Perhaps reduce the heat earlier (as you're still flipping) to allow more time for that temp to come down, or go to low instead of medium before adding the butter.",

I was always a minimal flips guy, but your reasons are sound, so I'm definitely up for the experiment.",

Way easier to get desired results, as it's almost impossible to overcook in a low temp oven.\n\nI often put my steak in for 40 - 60 mins, depending on the cut at about 275. Meanwhile you can get other stuff prepped, have a beer, etc. Then it's just a matter of getting the sear on the steak, which just takes two or three mins. Can also do the basting if you like as well and absolutely no danger of going past rare unless you walk away from the pan for 10 mins.\n\nEnd results are very similar, but I think ultimately the reverse sear is the best way. The other nice part about it is you can actually cook your steak right from frozen with this method.",

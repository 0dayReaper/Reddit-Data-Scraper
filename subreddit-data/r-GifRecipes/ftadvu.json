Garlic and onion both caramelize before they burn (think of a french roasted bulb of garlic), but onion has a much larger window because of its water content. It might be a bit surprising that garlic has more sugar than onion considering it usually doesn't taste sweet, but there is a source in the link above. \n\nA finer mince/paste is also more likely to burn than whole cloves or a course mince due to higher surface area. The water content in a piece of garlic is going to be the same no matter how you cut it unless you've manually added extra water. You're right though that by far the biggest factor is water content. \n\nThis is why the big difference maker is the *amount* of onion you use - if you add garlic/onion at the same time and use a small amount of onion in a large pan then your garlic will still burn, but if you have a lot of onion in a small pan (or a pot) there will be enough moisture from the onion that your garlic does not burn. The same is true for toasting spices, if you don't add enough onion your spices will also burn (this is a big deal in hungarian cooking when you mix paprika and onion). I suspect this is the reason most Indian dishes can add garlic/spices at the start, because most of them use a *lot* of onion.",

But not sure if that would be healthy. I did live eating mostly rice (with sides obviously) while I was in Asia.\n\nAnd generally, when I'm here in europe, I always have the same bread sandwich every day.",

Just to have a bit of a change \ud83d\ude02.\n\nI probably like pasta and even bread mostly because I'm a practical person, and using both pasta and bread are versatile enough for me not to have to stay thinking what to make.\n\nFor example yesterday I had some leftover rabbit (not sure if you eat rabbit there) I plucked the meat off and made a sort of carbonara, like I used the meat instead of guanciale and then made creamy sauce with eggs and cheese.\n\nI think the carbonara mention may not go down well if theres any carbonara gatekeepers here. Hope you're not one of them and you call them to come tell me off \ud83d\ude02",

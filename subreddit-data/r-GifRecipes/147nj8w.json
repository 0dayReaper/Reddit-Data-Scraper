You basically boil maple syrup until it suddenly gets extra frothy, triples in volume, and as it subsides it solidifies into a hot solid mass. The trick is to stir *hard* at that time, so it breaks into granules. (Because chipping apart a chunk is hard work!)\n\nI recommend searching for a proper recipe online. Or just order some. It tastes about the same: kinda like sugar that smells a bit like maple.\n\nGood luck!",

Preheat oven to 400F (375F convection oven). Line two baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove puff pastry sheet from the fridge. Set aside.n a small bowl, mix together cinnamon with sugar.\n2. In another small bowl, stir melted butter and allow to cool slightly.\n3. Lightly flour your clean work surface. Unroll or unfold sheet of puff pastry into ~ 1/4\" thick rectangle. Pastry should be cold to the touch. (note: if too warm, place back in fridge for 10-15 minutes)\n4. Brush the surface of the pastry with melted butter.\n5. Generously sprinkle cinnamon sugar over melted butter, until completely overing all of pastry surface.\n6. Using a sharp knife or pastry/pizza cutter, cut pastry into 16 thin, rectangular, strips. (note: I do this by first cutting the dough into 2, lengthwise. Then into 2, horizontally, then cutting each of the horizontal halves into 2, and finally, the horizontal quarters into another 2. This will leave you with 16 thin rectangular strips)\n7. To shape each twist, hold the ends of one thin piece of rectangular pastry with both hands (cinnamon mixture facing upwards). With your right hand, begin twisting pastry towards you so that cinnamon mixture is facing inwards. Continue until you have made 6-7 twisting rotations.\n8. Place cinnamon twists onto a prepared baking sheet, spacing each 2\" apart. Bake at 400F for ~15 minutes or until puffed and golden.\n9. Let cool on baking sheet and enjoy!",

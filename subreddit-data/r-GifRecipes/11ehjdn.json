            "comment": "Hello! Hi everyone, Wesley here. Today we\u2019re diving back into our series dedicated to Chinese dim sum and breakfast food classics with a shot at pretty much the very first thing that I look for on the dim sum carts any chance I get, which is the Chinese steamed and fried turnip cake, or \u201cluo bai gao.\u201d For those unfamiliar, a Chinese turnip cake as you might have guessed, prominently features a shredded and steamed Chinese turnip that has been mixed with an assortment of meats and veggies, then steamed into a solid form, and finally sliced and pan fried for a crispy exterior texture.\n\nThose following along with this series may know that the luo bai gao has many different popular variations on the same theme, most of which make use of different forms starchy root veggies. Some time ago we did a purple tinged version using taro root, and in fact for today\u2019s version in lieu of turnips, we\u2019re going to make use of these gorgeous daikon radishes that I found at the farmer\u2019s market, which are also a very common substitution. Most iconically though, the luo bai gao must include two ingredients, the first being these dried Chinese lap cheong sausages, and the second being rice flour. This would be the same stuff used to make things like mochi, which of course means that it will also give our turnip cakes a similarly wonderful chewy, sticky, and bouncy texture. Hope you try it. [**Follow the full video on youtube**](https://youtu.be/xq7UQ5kNiwk) for the whole story too!\n\n**Woo Can Cook** is a series where we reproduce fun foods and recipes from my childhood. Some of them are authentically Chinese and/or pan-Asian, but a lot of them are odd Americanized versions that I inherited from my parents and grandparents while growing up in the Bay Area/California.\n\n**Homebase** (Recipes, Livestream Schedule, Music and more): [Woo Can Cook](https://WooCanCook.com)\n\n**Recipes**: [Woo Can Cook (Youtube)](https://youtube.com/woocancook?sub_confirmation=1)\n\n**Music**: [Woo Cooks Beats (Lofi Beats to Cook to)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJjFjTkH7xM&amp;list=PL72dM3fKnbHupDC0cIOHxaHBvjZLY3TdT&amp;index=21)\n\n**Woo Can Cook Fried Rice Pop Up (Every Thurs-Sun @ Wondrous Brewing!)**: [https://WooCanCook.com/eats](https://WooCanCook.com/eats)\n\n**TikTok** (short recipes and Woo Cooks Beats): [Woo Can Cook](https://www.tiktok.com/@woocancook)\n\n**Instagram** (pop-up schedule, music, and random doggo cameos): [@woocancook](https://instagram.com/WooCanCook)\n\n**RECIPE** [https://www.woocancook.com/luo-bai-gao](https://www.woocancook.com/luo-bai-gao)\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* 4 cloves garlic\n* 1 inch (about 1 tbsp) ginger\n* 3 green onions\n* 4 shiitake mushrooms\n* 4 lap cheong sausages\n* 1 medium Chinese turnip (or daikon, or taro root)\n* 1 cup glutinous rice flour\n* 1/4 cup corn starch\n* peanut oil\n* chili oil (optional)\n* soy sauce (optional)\n\n**PREP**\n\n* CRUSH and mince the garlic, set aside\n* FINE MINCE the ginger, set aside\n* SEPARATE the whites and greens of the green onions, then slice thinly, set aside\n* REHYRDATE the shiitake mushrooms in boiling water for 15 minutes, then dice and set aside\n* DICE the lap cheong, set aside\n* REMOVE the root and tip ends of the daikon, then grate and set aside\n\n**ON THE STOVE**\n\n* BOIL 1 cup of water over medium heat, then add the shredded daikon and simmer for 5 minutes until tender and remove\n* REHEAT the wok, add 4 tbsp peanut oil and long yao\n* ADD the garlic, ginger, and whites of green onions and saute until fragrant for about 15 minutes\n* ADD the lap cheong and toss for 2-3 minutes\n* ADD the shiitake and toss to combine, then remove\n* COMBINE the cooked daikon, filling, and greens of green onions with 1 cup glutinous rice flour and 1/4 cup corn starch\n* ADD the batter to an oiled loaf pan, then tap on the counter to dislodge any air pockets\n* ADD the loaf pan to a steam basket in a tall stock pot with boiling water, then cover and steam over medium low heat for 60 minutes\n* REMOVE and cool in the refrigerator overnight\n* REMOVE the cake from the loaf pan, then slice with a wet serrated knife\n* HEAT a wok over medium low heat, then add 4 tbsp peanut oil and long yao\n* FRY the cakes for 2 minutes per side until golden brown\n* SERVE with chili oil and soy sauce",

They don't just sound similar.\n\nThat's because daikon radish's Chinese name is literally translated to \"white carrot\" (\u767d\u841d\u535c\uff09.\n\nWithout \"white\" (\u767d), \"lo bak gou\" (\u841d\u535c\u7cd5) literally translates to carrot cake.\n\nIn Asian countries, lo bak gou is indeed called \"Carrot Cake\" in English. Colloquially it is understood to refer to radish, not red carrots.\n\nI have never seen anybody call it \"Luo Bai\" though, which is my point.",

I personally am a Cantonese speaker and translate turnip and radish almost interchangeably at this point because of that. certainly nobody translates the Cantonese of this dish to carrot cake though, which is the language I was referring to the whole time.",

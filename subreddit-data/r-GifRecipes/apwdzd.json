Steak on, keep on high heat for the first part, until you\u2019ve got some good sear.

This is also when you would add your aromatics, like rosemary and garlic. You can start basting at this point as well. \n\nAn important part is getting a steak that has the right thickness. You don\u2019t want it too thin, because then you\u2019re going to over cook it before you get the really nice crust. And you don\u2019t want it too thick, because then it becomes a challenge to get it cooked consistently throughout. ",

But adding some herbs and garlic to the butter, squeezing a lemon or two in, and reducing a bit?  That improves even the best cut of meat.  Anyone that says otherwise is more on some beef memery than truly looking to produce the best tasting food.\n\nBut anyway the point is, none of those things are possible with that amount of oil.  A tiny bit should be used to help prevent smoking, but after that it\u2019s just enough butter to baste with.  Besides, a shallow fry like that is more likely to overcook the meat before you get a good crust.",

You wanna feel wafts of heat if you place your hand a few inches from the pan. \n\nAdd some canola oil. Swish it around. Get it nice and hot as well. Turn the burner down to about 4/10\n\nDrop in your steak (seasoned to your liking)  \n\nLet it sit. Don\u2019t touch it. It\u2019ll sizzle very loudly and violently. It\u2019ll also glue itself to the pan. This is what you want. Let it cook for about 4 minutes if it\u2019s thinner, about 5-6 if it\u2019s thicker. When the sear is complete, the steak will release itself from the pan and you can flip it. \n\nI add butter, garlic, and rosemary if I have it. Tilt the pan and baste the steak for the few minutes it\u2019s searing on the fresh side. \n\nWhen it releases easily from the pan you can flip and baste more if you want, or call it done. \n\n\n\nIMPORTANT PART\n\nLet the steak rest on a hot plate, covered in aluminum foil, on the stove for 10-15 minutes. The meat needs to relax. It\u2019ll get very tender, continue cooking, and the juices will flow. You\u2019ll end up with perfect medium rare every time once you get it down. \n\nFor especially thick steaks, you can throw the cast iron and all into a preheated oven after searing. That will help the center get to the temperature you want, while retaining juices",

Cast iron isn't the only cooking surface that will allow you to get a good sear, but it does retain heat pretty well, which is helpful.  In addition, a good heat source is going to help, as you can get a pan ripping hot, but the meat will lower the temp, and if your heat source doesn't have good recovery or your pan doesn't retain heat, it'll be difficult to get a good sear.\n\nI would recommend you get a meat thermometer and temp as you go.  A thermapen is fantastic but will run you about $100, while a thermapop is closer to $25-30.  It will take a pretty instant temp of the meat, allowing you to cook to your desired doneness (and the steak will rise in temp after taking it off the cooking surface).\n\nAlternatively, you can use the reverse-sear or sous vide methods to more accurately attain your final temp.  There are plenty of charts for sous vide (\"under vacuum\" - in a bag in a water bath) temps, or you can cook in a low oven (e.g. 225F) until you're around 15F below your final cooking temp.  Then you can just sear the crap out of it for a very short period of time.  The crust might not be quite as thick, but you can still get a fantastic sear and you'll have a perfectly cooked steak.",

Season your steak, let it come up from fridge temp while you preheat your oven (with the cast iron inside) to like 200F. Put in steak. Pull it around 125F internal temp.\n\nSet aside and let it rest, tented. While you get your cast iron ripping hot on the stove. Using a high smoke oil (Avocado, Safflower or Ghee) get a good coating on the pan. When you start to see the first puffs of smoke, lay your steak in. Let it ride 1-2 minutes and then flip when you have a good crust. \n\nWhen satisfied, reduce heat, add garlic, butter etc...and baste.  Remove when happy.  The key to a good sear is getting rid of the water. I like to salt/pepper my meat the night before, set on a rack in the fridge to dry and then pull to come up to temp before cooking.\n\nIf you want hands off. Go sous vide &gt; cast iron &gt; done.",

Add the potatoes to a medium-sized pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and continue to cook until the potatoes are tender, about 6-8 minutes. Drain the potatoes and set aside.\n2. Season the steak generously all over with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large cast iron skillet over high heat until beginning to smoke. Add the steak to the skillet and cook, flipping every 30 seconds or so for a total of 4 minutes, or until a brown crust forms. Sear the sides as well.\n3. Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter, garlic, and herb sprigs. Once the butter has melted, tilt the pan slightly so that the butter collects by the handle and use a spoon to splash the steak with the hot butter. Continue to baste, flipping the steak occasionally, until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the steak registers 120-125\u00b0F for medium rare, or 125-130\u00b0F for medium (about 3-4 more minutes). Set the steak aside to rest.\n4. Meanwhile, place the potatoes back into the skillet, cut-side-down. Make space for asparagus in the center of the skillet and add it. Cook, tossing the asparagus occasionally (but leaving the potatoes undisturbed) until the asparagus is just tender, about 6 minutes. Remove the asparagus and set aside on a serving plate. Continue to cook the potatoes until golden, about 2 more minutes. Set aside with the asparagus.\n5. Slice the steak, if desired, and serve with the potatoes and asparagus.",

Only searing one side at a time means that the other side (the one not touching the pan) will cool as the one in contact with the pan cooks. When you flip often, there's no cooling in between, which means that the cooking continues more steadily from both sides. Truthfully, it won't make a gigantically noticeable difference in the end result, but it has the added bonus of also making it easier to adjust and monitor the browning as you go.",

A reverse sear requires at least 1.5 inch thick steaks cooked for up to 45 mins at 200 or so, then pan sear in cast iron a couple mins each side. Its shocking how much faster a crust is formed after the slow low cook. Not good for rare, perfect for medium rare. I know nothing about anything more well done, since that would be a travesty anyway you cook it. ",

That's incorrect.\n\nMeat with nice marbling should be cooked to medium, in order to render the fat. If you aren't going to do that, because you want the \"juices from the meat\", then don't waste money on a well marbled steak. Cuts with little to no marbling are great rare. \n\nTough meats should be cooked 'low and slow', while tender ones *can* be cooked hot and fast.",

These are Kenji's guidelines: 105\u00b0F (41\u00b0C) for rare, 115\u00b0F (46\u00b0C) for medium-rare, 125\u00b0F (52\u00b0C) for medium, or 135\u00b0F (57\u00b0C) for medium-well. I usually go to 110-115\u00b0F (cooking in a 175\u00b0F oven) and then sear with my steak ending up at 120-130\u00b0F in the end. \n\nEdit: these temps are just for the initial sous vide or low-temp oven cooking. The final sear after your sous vide gives you the extra 15-20\u00b0 to get you to your final desired temp.\n\nEdit 2: someone else just made a good point below regarding the type of sear. I didn't specify it here but these temps are a guideline for a final pan-sear and not a torch-sear. I definitely think you'd have to increase the sous-vide temps if you're torch-searing. For a thorough walkthrough, [here is Kenji's actual recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/10/reverse-seared-steak-recipe.html). ",

I just figured my pan wasn't hot enough or something, because I was cooking the steak too far before getting a good sear.\n\nRecently, I said screw it and just started flipping my steak, partly to be able to monitor the sear, and just to try something else since my previous method wasn't working.\n\nWhat I found was that by flipping the steak a total of 4 times before going in the oven, I gave the top seared side a chance to breath and dry out before applying direct heat again. This gave me a WAY better sear before going in the oven for a few minutes, where the oven only helped that crust form a bit more. My first attempt at this flipping gave me a much much more evenly cooked steak at a medium rare, with a great dark sear. Go figure that was the night I was making a steak for my wife and not myself.",

I'd imagine it would also make it harder to get a good crust without over cooking the meat.  If you like your steak rare flipping it a lot is going to keep a good crust from forming.",

It doesn't make it hard at all to get a good crust though! If you like your steak rare. flip as I did for 4 minutes and then baste for only \\~1 minute with the butter (use an instant read thermometer to be exact-- rare steak should be cooked until it reaches around 110 degrees F), you will have rare steak with a good crust.",

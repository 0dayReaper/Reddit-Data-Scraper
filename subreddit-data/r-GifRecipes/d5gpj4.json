            "comment": "I posted the recipe in response to the stickied automoderator comment, but there are a few other things I wanted to bring up about this recipe for people who are coming here to learn more about the mac n cheese!  \n\n\n1. Cottage cheese... not my favorite food by a long shot. That being said, you can't taste it in this recipe. It helps to make a sauce that is creamy, cheesy, and thickens without a roux. \n2. I know, \"Magic\" Mac and Cheese sounds clickbaity. But it rolled off the tongue better than \"No Boil, No Roux Mac and Cheese\" so here we are.\n3. Yes, you can switch up the cheeses, HOWEVER keep in mind that I tested A LOT of cheese combinations in the making of this recipe. Like... hundreds of dollars worth of cheese. What I found is that expensive cheeses aren't worth it. Also, harder, more aged cheeses make it more likely that your cheese sauce will separate. If switching out any of the cheeses, I'd probably go with replacing the muenster. I've made successful variations with blue cheese, brie, monterrey jack, pepper jack, and gruyere instead of the muenster. That being said, they all were not as reliable, texture-wise.\n4. Don't use pre-shredded cheese, no matter what (except for the mozzarella, you can get away with it there). Pre-shredded cheeses are more difficult to melt smoothly. Grate your own from the block whenever possible!\n5. The cool thing about this recipe is that you can have it creamier or more casserole-y, if you'd like. Baking for a shorter time results in a creamier mac, whereas longer will make it more slice-and-serve-able.  \n\n\nThat's all that comes to mind off the top of my head. However I wrote my mac n cheese manifesto on the blog ([http://hostthetoast.com/magic-mac-and-cheese](http://hostthetoast.com/magic-mac-and-cheese)) with more details and I can talk mac n cheese ALL DAY LONG here, should you have any questions :)",

So you're absolutely right with the replacements you picked for the muenster. Cheddar can be replaced with Gouda, Edam, Swiss, or Gruyere. You CAN use hard cheeses without breaking the sauce, you just have to use less - about 1/4 the amount of other cheeses. The recipe I make typically uses equal parts aged cheddar, swiss or Monterrey, mozzarella and about a 1/4 part Dry Jack or Parmigiano-Reggiano. So there's some hope if you really want to add hard cheeses (I would, I can't eat any pastas almost without Parmigiano-Reggiano, Parmesan, or Asiago)",

Put in a pot with 1 cup of 2% milk and top off with water until it covers the noodles. Generously add salt, pepper, mustard powder, cayenne (remember, calories free seasonings are your friends). \n\nBring to a low boil, stirring often, and cook until noodles have absorbed most of the liquid. Add additional water as needed if noodles get too dry, stirring quickly to emulsify with the rest of the sauce. The noodles should have a nice \"saucy\" coating. \n\nOnce the noodles are cooked through, take off heat, add freshly grated 1oz of your favorite full fat cheese and mix in (I used sharp cheddar, and generally recommend flavorful cheeses instead of mild ones). Add chives or any other freshly chopped herbs of your preference. Mix well, cover the pot and let everything sit together for  a couple minutes.\n\nThat's like, 500 calories for a big ass bowl of mac and cheese (3oz is a big pasta serving) that doesn't taste like you're on a diet. \n\nYou can add veggies towards the end of the cook time to bulk it up as well (add additional milk at the beginning if you plan to do this).",

Proteins are thickening agents (think egg yolks, gelatin, etc), and by having more protein in the sauce, you are encouraging more thickening to occur as it's baked. Ricotta and cottage cheese both have a similar amount of protein by weight, but ricotta also is higher in calories and fat, which makes it feel heavier and the already heavy mac and cheese.",

More time = thicker sauce and softer mac. Honestly, I felt like the pasta wound up a little less gummy than it often does in mac n cheese, solely because you weren't over-baking it. Done the traditional way, tossing the pasta in some butter before combining it with a pre-made cheese sauce will help to prevent the pasta from bloating, but I still think it's more prone to overcooking, in my experience.\n\nAll of those sound great. I had to fight the urge to add bacon to this recipe-- I love bacon in mac and cheese but I figured people could choose their own adventures with mix-ins :)",

The cake recipes I\u2019ve been scouting lately fall into two categories: buttermilk so the acid can react with the baking powder and create rise, or boiling water. I\u2019m not sure what about it causes the rise, but I\u2019ve generally had better results with hot water cakes vs buttermilk. If I\u2019m out of espresso powder use a strong keurig brew instead.",

Baking SODA does need an acid to react with which may be why the recipes you\u2019re experimenting with may not be getting as much rise if it\u2019s just using powder. Oh and baking powder is double acting meaning it begins creating gas as soon as it dissolves in water with acid #1 (cream of tar tar I believe) and after it reaches a certain temperature it reacts with its second acid giving the baked good a second rise.",

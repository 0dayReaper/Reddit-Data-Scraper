There is also a subset of puddings which is a dessert steamed. There is also black or white pudding, or Christmas pudding, a steamed fruit cake.

Let me repeat myself: pudding is hot milk, set with either egg yolks or starch. It does not go into any oven. \n\nDepending on the kind of thickening agent you use, the flavouring, and whether you use milk, cream, or a combination of both, there are different names for pudding. Custard, cream, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9, flan,...\nSome people also put the ones that use gelatin in the list of puddings (like panna cotta). None of these are prepared in an oven.\n\nI cook a lot, and have been cooking for the past 30 years or so.\n\nBaking doesn't make sense in a pudding context, and the video might be by someone who doesn't speak English very well. It wouldn't be the first time I see an Asian video on YouTube talking about \"grilling water\" or \"boiling potatoes in fat\". So it is automatically assumed that \"not baking the pudding\" means \"not heating the pudding in any way\". \n\nAlso: whenever you see a no bake recipe, it implies that it's raw. Uncooked. Not heated. Not baked. Not boiled. Not anything. Usually for cakes, as they usually are baked. \"No bake\" has become a standard phrase to describe \"not cooked\", even when the original isn't baked but boiled, broiled, roasted, steamed or whatever.",

McDonalds also cooks their burgers with a heated press on top so that they cook twice as fast. This whole process is great if you want to get your burgers out fast as sanic,  but it compromises heavily on texture and most importantly moisture content. Which is why you never hear anyone describing a Big Mac as \"juicy\"",

The best time to season the meat with salt is right before it hits the heat source.\n\nEdits:\n\nSource (may have subscription ad overlay for some): https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/6586-when-to-salt-burgers\n\n\"\n\nFor the ideal tender, open texture in beef or turkey burgers, minimal handling of the ground meat and loosely packing it into patties are key. But when\u2014and where\u00ad\u00ad\u2014you salt the meat before cooking is equally important.\n\nWe seasoned ground beef three ways: In the first batch, we salted the meat before shaping the patties so that some of the salt got worked into the interior. In the second batch, we formed the patties and salted them on the outside 30 minutes before cooking. In the third batch, we salted the patties just before cooking. We found that the burgers salted before being formed into patties had a firm, almost snappy texture that was closer to sausage than any of us would have liked. (The salt works quickly; it makes a difference even if a burger sits for only a minute or two before cooking.) The patties that rested for 30 minutes after being salted on the outside had a tender interior but a dry and springy exterior, where the salt came into contact with the meat. Only the burgers that were seasoned on the outside and at the very last minute had the texture we liked.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on? Salt removes water from and dissolves some of the meat proteins, causing them to bind the insoluble proteins together\u2014something good for the springy bite to sausages, not for a tender burger. So wait to salt your burgers until just before they hit the pan or grill.\"",

You can do lean meat if you want, but using chuck like this gif will also turn out pretty damn good.\n\n2) Bacon is unnecessary in the patty.  Bacon works from the [maillard reaction](https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2015/04/07/the-science-of-bacon/) and the mouth feel.  Putting bacon in a patty will negate most of this.  If you want bacon flavor, cook bacon and put it on the patty.\n\n3) [DO NO SEASON THE INSIDE OF THE PATTY](http://aht.seriouseats.com/2009/12/the-burger-lab-salting-ground-beef.html)!  Salt and pepper are  some of the few seasonings that change the chemical composition of meat, and salt inside the patty will make it a much more rubbery mess. Season the outside before grilling and let it be.\n\nThat's about it.  Any other advice people might want to give is purely up to personal taste.  Enjoy your food.",

So I'd assume that's why you haven't seen this happen to your burgers.\n",

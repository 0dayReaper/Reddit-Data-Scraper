The only difference is that squash may be slightly sweeter.\n\nYou can follow the recipe here if you want some more detail https://pastawith.com/chorizo-carbonara-pasta-recipe/",

I hate mushy veg, so this way it was cooked just right, not too hard but nor soft.\n\nIf you want to cook the pumpkin more, before adding the pasta to the pan, take out some water from the pasta pot, maybe 2 table spoons, and add it to the pan with your pumpkin and chorizo. This will help it cook a bit more.\n\nHere is the link to the recipe - [https://pastawith.com/chorizo-carbonara-pasta-recipe/](https://pastawith.com/chorizo-carbonara-pasta-recipe/)\n\nAbout the name, I do understand that some may not like that I used carbonara. Because in fact, it is not a carbonara. But really, the concept of this dish was inspired from the original carbonara, so...I just named it chorizo carbonara. Jamie Oliver has his own version of chorizo carbonara too. Nothing to do with this though.\n\nI guess, I created this dish so I can name it what I want \ud83d\ude01",

Add a bit of pasta water to the egg and cheese mix and mix it into a cream.\n\n3. Add the egg mix to the pan after tossing in your pasta. Don't throw away the pasta water, just in case your mix is too dry, slowly add pasta water until right consistency.\n\nIf the sauce becomes too runny after adding to the pan, let it rest. The starch in the pasta water will help it thicken. Just give it a minute or 2",

Chorizo comes originally from the Iberian peninsula, so you can find ''chorizo'' or ''chorizo, cured'', and ''fresh chorizo''.\n\nSeems that ''Mexican-style'' chorizo often has grounded meat and red pepper, whereas Iberian chorizo often has chopped meat and smoked paprika. Various regional variations exists, so it's not rules written in stone.\n\nCurious if other countries than the USA are using the distinction, but that's a bit hard to find. \n\nThat's it for my chorizo trivia, folks.",

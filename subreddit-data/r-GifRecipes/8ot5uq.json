But somewhere replace something with Crisco?\n\nI don't know much about Crisco besides the time I won a bet against my drunk father and uncle when I was about 16. My mother had cooked frog legs and used Crisco as the hot oil. After Cooking all the frog legs, she let the oil cool for a moment and then began to comb the bottom of the wok for extra from meat. After finding what she wanted, she dropped the fork into the wok, about four inches deep in oil (and two inches deep in fried bread crumbs included). \nSo my uncle and father, both very inebriated, started try to pay me to get it out with my teeth. It ended up at close to $200 bucks when I said sure. \n\nI dipped my face all the way into the oil and fat and everything. Came up just past my eyes. Pulled the fork out and claimed my $200. Also was lucky enough to get a full litre of Heineken (courtesy of my uncle). \n\nAfter that I washed my face with the strongest detergent in the house (Dawn and then face wash) and got to drive my father's Jeep around to cool down my face.\n\nStill have a hard time with Crisco. But good luck bud. ",

Add the egg and vanilla and beat well. Stir in dry ingredients. Make balls of dough and roll in sugar. Flatten with the tines of a fork to make flat cookies with a crosshatch pattern on top. Bake at 350 F for 8-10 minutes. \n\nEDIT: Someone pointed out, in the most horrific way possible, that the OP's recipe most likely has Crisco instead of butter. Well I like to use butter in mine, but you can use Crisco in place of the butter, and you'll probably end up with slightly softer cookies if that's your preference! ",

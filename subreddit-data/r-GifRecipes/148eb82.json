You may be sensitive to saponins, the naturally occurring compounds on the surface of quinoa that discourages animals from eating the grain in the wild. If cooked quinoa tastes like soap or grass to you or causes an upset stomach, you may need to continue to rinse your quinoa before cooking. However, most quinoa that is sold in packages has been \"pre-rinsed,\" which means the saponins have been removed and rinsing isn't necessary. Check the packaging, and save yourself the effort. Boil-in-bag quinoa, which is now available at many supermarkets, is another convenient option that does not require rinsing.",

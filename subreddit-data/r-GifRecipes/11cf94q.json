Briny, vegetal, salty, and green, without the terrible bitterness of most olives.\n\n**However:** and this is coming from an almost all-around olive-hater. Try Castelvetrano olives before you decide you hate olives forever. They\u2019re mild, buttery and barely-bitter.\n\nI heard a lot of folks talk about Castelvetranos in the past, and I shrugged them off\u2026until I decided to make a surprise charcuterie board for my girlfriend one night. She likes olives, and since I wanted to like most of what was on the board too, I decided to try \u201cthe olive-hater\u2019s olive,\u201d and I was very pleasantly surprised!\n\nSo yeah, try to substitute with capers, I think that would be a great substitution. But if you\u2019re willing to give olives *one more chance,* try the Castelvetranos. I feel like even if you hate them, you\u2019ll hate them much less than any other olive you\u2019ve tried :)",

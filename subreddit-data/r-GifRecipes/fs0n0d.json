For Roman style Alfredo I would recommend using as little water as possible when boiling the pasta so you get very starchy water.

Add more pasta water until you reach the desired consistency then toss with the pasta.",

Once that's melted,  then my heavy cream goes in, burner on for another minute as low as it goes,  and that just warms a bit while I'm cooking the pasta. Add a couple tablespoons of the pasta water before draining them,  toss the butter/ cream,  pasta, (chicken if you choose) and parmesan with spices in the warm pasta cooking pan, off the heat.  The hot pasta,  warm pan,  and warm liquid should be more than enough to properly melt and incorporate the cheese without it going grainy. \n\nYou can do it without the pasta initially,  but this way is intended to be served immediately.",

You can pull off the Alfredo with the butter at about 140F, any higher just makes the sauce reduce, and there isn't that much moisture in alfredo because it's mostly protein and fat. \n\nThe higher the temp the higher the likelihood of the sauce breaking and becoming grainy.\n\nAdding butter at the end will KEEP the sauce smooth as it cools but if it's already grainy from being overheated it isn't going to do anything for you.",

It\u2019s obviously rich, but it\u2019s not as cloying as the recipes that call for cream. Plus, I think keeping the cream out simplifies but also sharpens the favors.",

Aim for just shy of the salinity of sea water. You'll think you added to much but most of it will dissolve / cook off / whatever salt in hot water does.   \n2) Skip salting the sauce until the end and, as others have said, don't toss everything in a bowl. Instead cook the pasta to just south of Al dente and then use tongs or a spoon to transfer to the pan with the sauce WITHOUT draining it super well. The idea is to get some splashes of water in the sauce. Pasta water will be salted and starchy which will season and thicken your sauce. It will also help it stick to the pasta better. Taste after incorporating and add more salt if desired.",

Nutmeg is *the defining spice* of alfredo. Somebody didn't do their research. Oregano and Basil aren't even supposed to be there. It's like baking a cake with no sugar. Completely misses the point. \n\n2) Why add salt, pepper, basil, oregano twice? I understand they're seasoning the chicken but you really don't ever need to take it out of the pan to begin with. *Combine like actions* is the motto in the industry. You waste time by measuring it out twice. \n\n3) Heavy Cream is better than milk. Heavy cream is harder to make curdle, and you don't need to use flour to make a roux to thicken the sauce. reducing the cream by half and then finishing it off with parmesan is the best way to get a thick sauce with little effort. \n\neither way, this looks good!",

The powder doesn't disperse and you will feel the grittiness in the drink. Way better to just leave a cinnamon stick in the brew pot and enjoy the infusion.",

I had to change a few things based on what was available but it turned out pretty good! It's fun to make if you have time to kill, even if it was a little messy to put together. It took a little over 3hrs to cook for me but I think I didn't use quite enough heat beads at the start so I topped them up with another 3/4ish tin after about 2hrs and it started coming good. It wasn't the smoothest ride, but for my second rotisserie attempt ever, it was definitely a success! The pork alone is okay, but combined with the home made guac and other stuff (we also randomised the toppings, it may be uncultured but I require cheese wherever possible) it was a winning combo! I always know when I offer my leftovers to my partner and it's an instant \"yesplease\" it tasted amazing. Overall easy now that I've learned where I messed up, fun to make and tasty to eat!",

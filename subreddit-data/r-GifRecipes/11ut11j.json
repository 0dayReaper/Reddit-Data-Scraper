I like the skin-on roasted or in a braise where it will get crispy (seared first) and stay that way, but in a soup where it's just going to get soggy in liquid? Pass. I'd remove the skin, render it first alone in the pan for schmaltz, and use that schmaltz as the fat to cook the veggies in (and I'd salt and shamelessly eat the crisped skin itself, or maybe crumble it on top of the individual bowls of soup as a finishing garnish).",

It also helps that I mostly cook for just myself and chopping up a scallion or two is more convenient than using a third of an onion or something. I end up forgetting about it too, so I will have like three partial onions in my fridge. Shallots are good for this too.",

Total kitchen noobs who have been told to try something easy like chicken soup, who have never heard of couscous and it will just sound exotic.

(Seriously, he freaked out when I put lemon on my fish, got a whole lecture about tradition and \"mom's cooking\" and respect). I was 25 before I ever had Caesar salad. I had to move to a whole new country to get out of my \"basic\" food headspace. \n\nI love to cook now. Regularly win competitions and everything. Get asked to cook for family weddings and reunions. But past me, basic me, would have noped right out of trying that recipe. I know it's hard for people who love cooking, and perhaps always have, to imagine people like that, but I was one. And words matter. \n\nAs a side note, I do think couscous, lemon, and red pepper add a layer of complexity to the flavor of the dish over and above what one would find in a basic soup. Yeah, it's not advanced, not sophisticated and truly complex, but not basic either.",

It only takes twenty minutes and the chicken is tender and juicy not dried out and stringy.\n\nNo onion\u2026they dilute the flavor.\n\nAdd about ten peppercorns and a couple of bay leaves. Also add about a tsp of white pepper.\n\nThere\u2019s more but she\u2019ll haunt me if I share the rest.

The prepared broth amplifies the flavor of the soup bc it\u2019s such a short simmer time. When I make broth, I cook it minimally 2-3 hrs. \n\nI won\u2019t acknowledge your comment re: potatoes in soup. That\u2019s just silly.",

            "comment": "**Recipe here originally:** [**Pork Chops with Braised Red Cabbage**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/pork-chops-with-braised-red-cabbage/)\n\nYou can also follow [**@triedandtruerecipes**](https://www.instagram.com/triedandtruerecipes/) on IG for food, movies, and other nonsense.\n\nThis was sooooo good. I'm obsessed with the golden beet stuff. Not sure it's technically a relish since I served it warm, but I don't really know what else to call it! I was piling it on top of roasted potatoes and eating it as a snack. It's earthy, sweet, and spicy, with a kind of jammy texture. I could also see it working really on deviled eggs!!\n\nI really wanted to make red cabbage with apples but I didn\u2019t have apples but I had some wrinkly golden beets in the fridge so that\u2019s where I got the idea for the relish. I thought they\u2019d be weird in the cabbage, but I\u2019m really happy with how they turned out for a pork chop topping!\n\n**Pork chops and braised red cabbage:**\n\n* \u00bd pound thick sliced bacon, cut into lardons\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 4 thick-cut, bone-in pork chops (video only shows 2!)\n* 1 pound head of red cabbage, cored and chopped\n* 2 tablespoons sugar\n* 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar\n* 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard\n* 1 orange, juiced\n* \u00bd cup water\n* Salt and pepper\n\n**Golden beet relish:**\n\n* 1 teaspoon caraway seeds\n* 1 teaspoon fennel seeds\n* Flaky sea salt, to taste\n* 2 medium golden beets, peeled and finely diced\n* 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard\n* 1 shallot, peeled and finely diced\n* 1 Serrano pepper, trimmed and finely diced\n* 1 orange, juiced\n* \u00bc cup distilled white vinegar\n* \u00bc cup maple syrup\n* \u2153 cup water, plus more if needed\n\n**For serving:**\n\n* Roasted or mashed potatoes\n\n**Preheat oven to 350\u00aaF.**\n\n**Prepare the relish:**\n\n1. Place fennel seeds and caraway seeds in a small skillet, crushing the seeds between your fingers as you sprinkle them in. Add a pinch of flaky sea salt. Turn the heat to medium and toast for 45 seconds. Add the golden beets, shallot, and Serrano pepper and cook for 3\u20134 minutes, turning occasionally, until they begin to warm through completely.\n2. Add in the mustard, orange juice, vinegar, maple syrup, and 1/3 cup water. Season with salt. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low and simmer for 30\u201345 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the relish becomes jammy and sticky. Add more water as needed to loosen up the relish as needed. Taste and season once more.\n\n**Cook the bacon:**\n\n1. Place the diced bacon in a wide pot over medium heat. Cook, turning often until the fat completely renders from the bacon and the bacon crisps up. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour all but 1 tablespoon of rendered bacon fat into a heat-proof glass.\n\n**Brown the pork chops:**\n\n1. Pat the pork chops dry and season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Add 1 tablespoon neutral oil to the 1 tablespoon bacon fat in the pot. Add the pork chops and cook without moving for 3\u20135 minutes per side until browned. Brown the fat caps for 1 minute or so and then transfer the pork chops to a baking sheet. Transfer to the oven for 15\u201320 minutes or until the pork chops reach desired internal temperature, 135\u00baF\u2013140\u00baF is ideal for medium-rare as the chop will rest up to 145\u00baF.\n3. Remove the pork chops from the oven and tent them with foil.\n\n**Prepare the cabbage:**\n\n1. Drain and discard the oil in the pot. Heat up 1\u20132 tablespoons of the reserved bacon fat. Once hot, add the diced cabbage and season all over with salt and pepper to taste. Add the sugar, orange juice, distilled white vinegar, and mustard. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage is tender, 15\u201320 minutes. Stir all but a pinch of the cooked bacon into the cabbage. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the braised cabbage between plates and place a pork chop on top. Spoon the golden beet relish on top of each chop. Sprinkle the rest of the crispy bacon on top of each dish. Serve alongside roasted potatoes if you like. Enjoy!",

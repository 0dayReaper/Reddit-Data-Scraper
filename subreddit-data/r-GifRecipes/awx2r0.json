The cooking process is similar to the gif, but instead of using citric acid and rennet, it's made using lemon juice or vinegar.\n\nYou heat whole milk to about 182 degrees F, stirring frequently to prevent scorching, then take it off the heat and gently mix in the lemon juice or vinegar (about 1/4c per 1/2 gallon of milk) and salt. Let it sit for 5-7 minutes and then drain. If you don't get good curd formation, you can add a little more acid and let it sit a few more minutes before draining. The more liquid you drain, the firmer your cheese will be. I always reserve some of the whey in case I decide I've drained off too much liquid the first time; you can always stir some back in. I like to leave mine somewhat creamy; it's fantastic dolloped on top of pasta with red sauce.",

            "comment": "Source: [Allrecipes UK]( http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/27972/homemade-mozzarella-cheese.aspx)\n\n1 1/2 teaspoons citric acid \n\n120ml cool water \n\n1/4 teaspoon liquid rennet \n\n60 ml cool water \n\n3.75L full fat milk \n\n\nDissolve the citric acid in 120ml cool water. In a separate container, combine the liquid rennet with 60ml cool water. Set both aside.\n\nIn a large pan, combine the milk and citric acid mixture. Over medium heat, heat the milk to 32 degrees C, stirring occasionally. When the milk reaches 32 degrees C, remove from heat and slowly stir in the rennet mixture (stir in a figure-8 motion for 30 seconds, then in the reverse motion to still the milk).\n\nCover the pan and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes.\n\nUncover the pan. The curd should be firm, with a clear separation between the curd and the whey around the sides of the pan. To check, take the back of a spoon or spatula and very gently press down on the curd at the edge of the pan. If the curd is too soft or the whey is milky, cover and let sit for a few more minutes.\n\nWorking in the pan, slice the curd into 2cm squares (a palette knife works well for this). Gently stir to agitate the curds, but don't break up the squares.\n\nBring the pan back to the hob and heat to 43 degrees C over medium heat, slowly and gently moving the curds in one direction with a spoon.\n\nWith a slotted spoon, ladle the curds into a colander set over a bowl to catch the whey. Gently pressing the curds, let the whey drain, then pour the whey back into the pan.\n\nHeat the whey to 85 degrees C. Put on disposable vinyl or latex gloves. Tear off a piece of the curd and place on a slotted spoon. Immerse the curd in the hot whey for 5 to 10 seconds. Immediately stretch, fold and knead the curd. Place back in the slotted spoon and immerse in the hot whey for another 5 to 10 seconds. Stretch, fold and knead the curd again; it should now stretch and be smooth and elastic. If not, repeat the process once more.\n\nForm the curd into a ball (or desired shape) and set aside. Repeat process until all curd has been used.\n\nAllow mozzarella to cool (speed up the process by placing in an ice-water bath) and store in the fridge till needed.\n\n\n\n\n**Notes**: They wait until the end to add **salt** in this gif. I wouldn't do that. Add salt while you're pulling it, or brine the cheese balls in a cold **brine** after you form them. This recipe is for **uncultured mozzarella**, but you can make a cultured mozzarella, too! I have done so using mesophilic cultures I ordered online. You add the cultures and let them sit after you heat the milk but before you add the rennet. Always use **gloves** when working with the curds because they are quite hot. And be careful not to overwork it\u2014you need to stretch and knead it, but if you do it too much it will be stiff/rubbery. My biggest tip is to use **raw milk** to start with, or at the very least use one that was **low-temp pasteurized**. High-temp pasteurized milk will denature the protein and prevent the cheese from forming properly. You can do some research on your local brands to see which ones are \u201cUHT\u201d or ultra high temp pasteurized.\n\n **Rennet** is a collection of enzymes found in cow/calf stomachs that curdles the casein in milk (making it easier to digest). It's used to make cheese and *junket* (a milk pudding set with rennet) and you can find it in the baking aisle. [Here's a common type you can buy](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/73d25ac5-a1c0-4450-b8c8-e4cda3acaf4f_1.5021969c53de51a00c6522781eb2bd45.jpeg). You can also get a vegetarian version! \n\n Finally, you might notice that **citric acid** is easy to find in bulk, and my advice is just get a bunch of it because it stores well and has multiple uses. If you're freezing fresh fruit, it's great as a preservative. It's a nice addition to dry rubs. It lends bright acidic notes to sauces. And you can make homemade bath bombs with it. It's found in the canning section of grocery stores, on Amazon, and craft stores. \n\n\n I\u2019m sure other people in here will have notes to add as well! \n\n",

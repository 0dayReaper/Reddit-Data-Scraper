Pasta is made using semolina durum wheat flour and water (or eggs if made fresh), with the end result being a macaroni dough ball. Noodles are made using common wheat flour and water (sometimes also with eggs, depending on type and whether or not the noodles are fresh).\n\nPasta is also made using an extrusion process (this includes homemade fresh pasta, even if made by hand). Noodles are not made this way, and traditionally are made by dropping hand cut ribbons of dough into boiling water). \n\nLastly, pasta is not cooked as long as noodles, and is meant to be al dente. Noodles, *because* they are cooked longer (and are made using a finer flour) are softer.\n\nLong length pastas like linguine and spaghetti are still pastas, because they are made using semolina and are made using an extrusion process. All noodles are long-ish, but are easy to distinguish from pasta simply by the ingredients used to make them. Vermicelli uses rice flour, udon uses wheat flour, egg noodles use eggs (surprise).\n\nFun fact! Spaetzel is a pasta, and gnocchi is a noodle!",

Quite often with adjectives to describe sauces or proteins. \n\nThe lasagna of Naples, lasagne di carnevale, is layered with local sausage, small fried meatballs, hard-boiled eggs, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, and sauced with a Neapolitan rag\u00f9, a meat sauce.[10]\n\nLasagne al forno, layered with a thicker rag\u00f9 and b\u00e9chamel sauce and corresponding to the most common version of the dish outside Italy, is traditionally associated with the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Here, and especially in its capital, Bologna, layers of lasagna are traditionally green (the colour is obtained by mixing spinach or other vegetables into the dough)[11] and served with rag\u00f9 (a thick sauce made from onions, carrots, celery, finely ground pork and beef, butter, and tomatoes),[12][13] bechamel and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.\n\nIn other regions, lasagna can be made with various combinations of ricotta or mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, meats (such as ground beef, pork or chicken), and vegetables (such as spinach, zucchini, olives, mushrooms), and the dish is typically flavoured with wine, garlic, onion, and oregano. In all cases, the lasagne are baked (al forno).",

Its like adding more water to a soup, you are just diluting taste, not enriching it.\n\nAs a fellow member of \" PIGS\" I'm really curious about it.\n\nEdit: you can downvote me all you want and say it makes it thicker not runnier. The thing is most of the dishes I see on Reddit that use this look more diluted and wet than anything else. I will ask again, and you can sit on it to think, is it possible that this is more a tradition? Are the ppm diluted un the water that meaningful?",

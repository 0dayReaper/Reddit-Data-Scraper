The reason you get slabs is usually because someone cut the meat with the seams instead, which makes it not come apart.\n\nIf you want to make sure, when you cut it up, just put it back in the juice and cook a bit longer. You need to take the meat out earlier, though, so you don't end up overcooking.",

This is why sometimes I try to pre cut meat into bite size pieces before I serve it to people. some people just don't understand this and don't get to enjoy it as much as the work I put into it. I just dress it up and make it look like I was trying to make it \"fancy\" rather than just compensating for their incompetence. Also, it makes it easier to eat everything with chopsticks... Which are easier to wash than a bunch of other utensils. ",

You'd damn near need a meat slicer to cut it thin enough to do that at that cooking time. Bite through? Sure, but I normally expect to be able to easily pull the beef apart with a beef dip and I just don't feel it's thin enough, and/or cooked long enough for that.\n\nThis is just my personal opinion anyway as someone that's slow cooked plenty of roasts for sandwiches. I could just suck at it, or prefer my beef more \"pull apart\" tender than other people.",

The main thing with a French dip is that you have the jus and a hearty enough bread to soak it up, the form of the beef really doesn't matter as much.",

                            "comment": "A grilled cheese consists of only these following items. Cheese. Bread with spread (usually butter). This entire subreddit consist of \"melts\". Almost every \"grilled cheese\" sandwich i see on here has other items added to it. The fact that this subreddit is called \"grilledcheese\" is nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have nothing against melts, I just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses. Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? It's called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I don't know what the hell you'd call that but it's not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to wager I've eaten more grilled cheeses in my 21 years than any of you had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread. But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled \"melts\" because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. I'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac &amp; cheese. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. Shit, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I've seen post after post of peoples \"grilled cheeses\" all over reddit and it's been driving me insane. The moment i saw this subreddit this morning I finally snapped. Hell, I may even start my own subreddit just because I know this one exists now.\nYou god damn heretics. Respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into whatever you like and love it for it what it is. Or make your damn melt sandwich and call it for what it is. A melt",

The first roast off the ball in of the bottom is a regal rump, but the actual rump roast normally is cut from a whole round piece that has the top, eye, and bottom together still.\n\nDon't know where you work, but I know for us they phased out the whole Round about 8 years ago for us in favor of the piece method since it's much easier to handle.\n\nBut, all that's moot since people who ask for a rump tend to get a bottom from us since it's the closest equal haha.

Thanks for the difference description, idk all that much about the cuts other then steaks, cooking them however u want a good marbeling so when the fat cooks down or Renders as its called, it produces more flavour. First thing you learn in culinary arts is fat=flavour. The bigger the fat spots the harder it is to render down as it takes longer and makes the beef tougher. ",

Pat the beef chuck roast dry, and season generously with the kosher salt and pepper on all sides.\n1.     In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil. Add the roast and sear for 4 to 5 minutes per side, or until a brown crust has formed.\n1.     Place the seared roast into the slow cooker.\n1.     Return the skillet to medium-high heat. Add the sliced onion and saut\u00e9 until translucent.\n1.     Add the red wine to the skillet and deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits from the pan before adding the mix of onion, red wine, and browned bits to the slow cooker.\n1.     Add the beef broth, bay leaf, garlic and salt to the slow cooker.\n1.     Cover and cook on low for 4 hours.\n1.     Remove the roast from the slow cooker and slice into thin pieces.\n1. Add the sliced beef back to the slow cooker and continue to cook another 2 hours.\n1. When the meat is close to being done, preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (205 degrees Celsius).\n1.     Place the French rolls open-faced on a sheet pan and toast until golden brown.\n1.     Remove the meat from the slow cooker and strain the cooking liquid for au jus. Reserve the au jus for dipping later, and divide the meat among the prepared French rolls. Top with 2 slices of Swiss cheese.\n1. increase the oven temperature to broil. Return the pan of sandwiches to the oven and broil, open-face, until the cheese has melted and begun to brown.\n1.     Serve the sandwiches with the reserved au jus on the side for dipping.\n\n**CHEF\u2019S TIP**\n\n*     Slicing the chuck roast and returning it to the slow cooker allows the flavors of the broth to fully penetrate the meat.",

Typically you'll use more kosher salt than regular table salt because the granules are much bigger, so you will likely over season if you use the same amount of finer salt. Kosher salt is much better for meat seasoning and brining, while table salt is often a seasoning finisher. So yeah, you *could* use regular salt but make sure to use less, but in my opinion kosher salt would be the way to go. Hope that helps, friend! I'm sure there are many more knowledgable people on here that could tell you more and give better reasoning.",

Potassium Iodine leaves an unpleasant taste on the pallet. Where koshering salt only tastes salty (do a taste test between koshering and iodonized table salt and you will see difference.\n\nKoshering salt is cheaper than flaked sea salt where I am and sea salt has a different taste (it has a magnesium salt in it IIRC)",

Get some beef consomme in a can, put it in a pot. Season the broth with pepper, rosemary, onion powder and garlic powder. Bring to a boil and reduce heat. Drop the sliced roast beef in there, allow it to warm up for a couple minutes. Then do the whole broiler thing, and use the liquid you cooked the meat in for dipping. But I usually make a garlic mayo and put a thin layer on the bread before broiling, and use provolone. Quick, easy, and delicious.",

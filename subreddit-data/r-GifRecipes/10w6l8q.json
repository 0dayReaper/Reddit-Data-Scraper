            "comment": "**Recipe here originally:** [**Garlic Butter Shrimp with Olives**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/garlic-butter-shrimp-and-olives/)\n\nYou can follow [**@triedandtruerecipes**](https://www.instagram.com/triedandtruerecipes/) **on Instagram** for more recipes, movies, and other nonsense.\n\nSorry the colors on the video suck - still trying to learn how to use these video editing programs. \ud83d\ude11 the video came out super desaturated and gray. you can look at the pics linked in the post above for more accurate colors. \n\nI use needle-deveined shrimp in this recipe because they don't have to slice the backs open to devein them. I like the way it looks better since the backs don't flare out when cooking :) Use traditionally deveined shrimp if you can't find needle-deveined.\n\nI know I'll get comments about the tails...it's a personal preference. Leave them on, if you like. Take them off, if you like. It's really up to you. Tails do add a lil extra flavor oomph as they're cooking, but if you don't like them, take them off. Just make sure you save them to make homemade stock!!\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 6 ounces Castelvetrano olives, torn in half\n* 4\u20135 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* 1 lemon, juiced\n* Crushed red pepper to taste\n* 3 tablespoons butter\n* 1 tablespoon olive oil\n* \u00bd cup dry white wine or use shrimp or chicken stock\n* 1 pound needle-deveined shrimp, tails on or off depending on preference\n* \u2153 cup loosely packed parsley, minced\n* Salt and pepper\n\n**Instructions**\n\n**Prepare the olives:**\n\n1. Combine olives, minced garlic, lemon juice, and crushed red pepper in a bowl. Let stand for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to marry.\n\n**Saut\u00e9 olives and garlic:**\n\n1. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil.\n2. Once the butter begins to bubble, add the olive mixture. Saut\u00e9 for 2-3 minutes.\n\n**Reduce the wine:**\n\n1. Pour in the white wine and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a rapid-simmer for 5 minutes. Continue cooking until reduced by half.\n2. Saut\u00e9 the shrimp: Pat the shrimp dry and season all over with salt. Add them to the skillet and saut\u00e9 for 4-5 minutes or until just opaque. Stir in the parsley and immediately remove the shrimp from the heat (the residual heat will continue to cook the shrimp).\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Transfer to a serving bowl. Serve with crusty bread or pasta. Enjoy!",

I make it all the time and served it to my friends for Christmas Eve and they were blown away. \n\nVery similar to this but with capers instead of olives. Here\u2019s how I make it: Mash anchovies into butter with capers and fry until anchovies are \u2018melted\u2019. Add shit ton of crushed red pepper and garlic. I add a little anchovy oil from the tin. Then, fry tomato paste. Add whole peeled tomatoes and cook until thick and jammy. Add shrimp and then toss with pasta. \n\nMidnight spaghetti usually includes an Herby breadcrumb topping but haven\u2019t done that In awhile. It\u2019s good with or without.

Preheat oven to 375F (350F convection bake). Line 2x baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.\n2. In a medium saucepan, melt butter and sugar on medium-low heat. Stir frequently until mixture has a liquid consistency. Turn off stove.\n3. Stir in oats, maple syrup, vanilla and salt. Mixture will be thick and glossy in appearance. It will continue to thicken the longer it sits.\n4. Place 1 tsp of oat mixture onto cookie sheet, leaving ~2 inches between cookies to allow for their spread. Bake for 8-9 minutes or until golden brown on edges and flat in appearance.\n5. Allow lace cookies to cool completely on cookie sheet.\n6. Remove carefully from baking sheet and enjoy!\n7. Optional:\u00a0Sandwich cookies with 1 tsp of melted chocolate or chocolate-hazelnut spread spread over one of the cookie sides.",

When it comes out of the oven it will be soft and pliable (but super hot) you can bend them when they are thisbhot to make tubes (traditional brandysnap shape) or leave them over a muffin tin to make bowl shapes. When they cool they will be hard and brittle. The cupcake bowl shape is particularly nice with icecream.... not sure how the oats would effect it though.",

The butter is behaving as a means to distribute the sugar evenly and encourage caramelization of the sugar. A thickened syrup will be more likely to burn if not stirred, which wouldn\u2019t be good in a baked cookie. I would suspect you will want to sub in a fat that is semi firm at room temperature for the balled raw to flattened cooked change, a liquid substitute will probably not transition in the same way. \n\n\nIn my experience baking other things, margarine works well as a sub, but it isn\u2019t an improvement from a health/nutrition stand point. Your opinion &amp; mileage may vary. \n\nCoconut oil might work as well, but it\u2019s going to change the flavor significantly. \n\nVegetable shortening is popular in baking, and aside from flavor it can have butter like characteristics in baking. I would give this a try myself as a first alternative. \n\nLard, tallow, or bacon fat may also work well\u2026. Hmmmm maple bacon lace cookies might be in the near future. \n\nSubstituting for allergies or preferences is your choice, just remember-it\u2019s not the delicious food\u2019s fault we might get fat, it\u2019s our own lack of portion control, hormones, and appropriate activity levels to go with the calorie intake. Sugar will kill you faster than fat, but too much of any one thing is not good.",

They crisp and chewy too.\n\nBreaking them into little bits makes for a fun mouth feel. It's like an oatmeal Carmel crisp.\n\nThird batch came out much the same. Nice shattery crispy. Just they are full circles/oblongs. (Also on parchment paper)\n\nI should have known better. I kinda hate using silicone mats for baked goods and much prefer parchment but I figured why not. The silicone came out awful btw. Spread so much the oatmeal was just a sticky mess",

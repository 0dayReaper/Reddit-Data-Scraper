If you want to do a vegan version you can add roast mashed butternut squash to the filling and it works great because the sweet of the squash works with the earthiness of the mushrooms.",

Never cover completely the bottom of your steamer with the leaves, the steam won't have any place to go and it'll take forever. What we do in Mexico is take the leaves that aren't usable and shred them in stripes, then place some at the bottom, leaving some parts uncovered, just don't leave big patches without leaves, else the steam will go up too quickly and hard, and that'll might overcook the tamales that are in that area, and also will evaporate your water quickly. The top part can be covered completely without issues.",

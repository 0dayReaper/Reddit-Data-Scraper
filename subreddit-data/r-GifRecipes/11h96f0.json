Personally I prefer of a more peanut flavour in my Penang than this curry paste provided.\n\nBut I can try to add more peanut and give this recipe a shot.\n\nThanks",

This paste \u2014 and many of the Panang pastes available that I saw (Mae ploy, arroy-d, etc) are actually made without peanuts at all which I thought was interesting. If you buy a Panang simmer sauce, they usually add peanut butter. I think if you were to use this brand, you\u2019d want to add a scoop of peanut butter and a touch of nutmeg to get that signature nutty aroma.",

Heat 2 tablespoons of neutral oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until it just begins to soften.\n2. Add the garlic, chili peppers, and lemongrass paste. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n\n**Bloom the curry paste:**\n\n1. Stir the paste into the aromatics and sizzle in the oil for 2\u20133 minutes until it deepens in color and begins sticking to the bottom of the pot.\n2. Pour in enough coconut milk to cover the paste. Bring to a boil for a few minutes and pour in the remaining coconut milk.\n\n**Simmer the soup:**\n\n1. Pour in 4 cups water or vegetable stock. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and add the vegetables and cubed soft tofu. Stir gently to combine, being careful not to break up the tofu too much. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.\n2. Simmer for 10\u201312 minutes or until the vegetables are tender and crisp. Turn off the heat.\n\n**Cook the noodles:**\n\n1. As the soup simmers, soak or boil the noodles according to package instructions. Drain, rinse, and divide between bowls.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Ladle the broth over the noodles and pile the tofu and vegetables on top. Garnish with cilantro, minced scallions, sliced red onion, crispy shallots, and chili oil if you like. Serve with lime wedges. Enjoy!\n\n*\\*Note: Look for vegan curry paste if keeping a vegan diet. Certain brands prepare their Panang curry paste without animal products. For instance, Maesri\u2019s Panang curry paste is vegan, but Mae Ploy uses shrimp paste.*",

You skim off the solid part from the top of the coconut milk (alternatively you can buy a can of coconut cream). This solid part is coconut cream. You add it to a hot skillet first and simmer until the oil separates out. You\u2019ll end up with a sort of lumpy mass. It takes like 10-12 minutes to achieve this. The water also evaporates making for a richer curry. \n\nOnce it separates, you add the paste and fry it in that mixture and continue on with the recipe.",

In my part of the country, curry mee is equivalent to laksa but not other parts. In general, laksa *can* be used as a word for curry mee. (Though of course it can be misused)",

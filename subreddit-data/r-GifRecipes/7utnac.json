Let it warm and sizzle a bit then into the awaiting nachos or burrito. \n\nAnd if it's a burrito you keep a bit of the fat cap from the beef and toss it in a pan. Roll the tortilla tight and fry the shit out of the open end. Pressing it hard with the spatula. Flip and repeat.\n\nAbsolute perfection comes out of the pan. But all together you probably have a 1500cal burrito. Magnificent ",

That way you can use one tortilla shell for four crunchwraps. The quarter is still plenty big enough.\n* If you can't buy tostadas where you live (like me) round tortilla chips work just as well. I layer 5-6 instead of using a tostada and it's just as good.\n* Instead of oiling the pan, just use the same pan you used to cook the beef. It makes the outside tasty.\n* I put guacamole and corn salsa in mine and it's really good.",

If you place the wrap with exposed cheese quickly onto the hot pan it cooks into a crispy self sealing layer. Then flip and cook the other side. No wasted or extra shell required. Moes also adds an exta tostada shell and queso dip to their wrap which is what makes it superior to the crunchwrap but not necessary for homemade wraps. ",

The other half (myself included) folded both sides in to meet at the middle, then four folds on the corners.\n\nAlso my store just used this flat grill instead of a panini press. Thing looked like ass after a day's worth of ingrediants fell out on it.",

That's as Tex-Mex as a food origin can get.

There are a lot more camar\u00f3nes to be had when you're on the sea!  \n\nI live in the Pacific Northwest; we definitely get more mainstreaming of the coastal Mexican in our generic mexican restaurants and burrito joints: more seafood, more crema, eating Mission-style burritos (which may not have originated in SF, but became big there), and so on.  \n\nAnyway, I didn't mean to suggest that Taco Bell is authentic, but your national Mexican chains such as Azteca and Chipotle are mainly pulling dishes from Tex-Mex and Baja (as qualified above), tweaked for the American palate.  Authenticity is not job 1. ",

They come out pretty great and they're quick and easy to make.\n\nOne thing - tostada shells are not always as easy to find as regular taco shells. You can make a ghetto version of the tostada shell by just taking any crunchy taco shell and snapping it in half, removing the curved lip part, and then putting the two halves together in the middle. It still works just as well.",

What's the ingredients and the amounts, in whatever measurement you want to use, of all the stuff someone would need to cook this? \n\nI don't know, I thought this sub's purpose was inspiration, and to get people to start cooking (new) things, not like-factories for a select few \"social media content creators\".

Nacho Cheese Sauce\n* 4 tostada shells\n* 1 c. sour cream\n* 2 c. Shredded lettuce\n* 1 c. chopped tomatoes\n* 1 c. shredded Cheddar\n* 1 c. Shredded Monterey Jack\n* vegetable oil\n* Hot sauce, for serving\n\nDIRECTIONS:\n \nIn a skillet over medium heat, add ground beef, chili powder, paprika and cumin. Cook, breaking the meat up with a wooden spoon, until the beef is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain fat, then season with salt and pepper.\n\nCut small flour tortillas: Stack four large flour tortillas and place a tostada shell in the center. Using a paring knife, trace around the edges of the shell to cut four smaller flour tortilla rounds. Set aside.\n\nBuild crunchwraps: With remaining large flour tortillas, add a scoop of ground beef to the center of each tortilla, leaving a generous amount of space around the edges for folding. Drizzle cheese sauce over each, then place tostada shells on top. Spread sour cream over each shell, then top with lettuce, tomato, and cheeses.\n\nPlace the smaller flour tortilla cutouts in the center of each crunchwrap then tightly fold the edges of the large tortilla towards the center, creating pleats. After wrapping, quickly invert crunchwraps so the pleats are on the bottom and they stay together.\n\nCook crunchwraps: In a medium nonstick pan over medium heat, heat a very thin layer of vegetable oil. Working one at a time, add crunchwrap seam-side down and cook until tortilla is golden on the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip crunchwrap and cook until the other side is golden, 3 to 5 minutes more.\n\nRepeat with remaining crunchwraps and serve warm with hot sauce.",

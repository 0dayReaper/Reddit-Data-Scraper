Instead, it\u2019s separated into liquid and oil (meaning it\u2019s probably cheddar), and a lot of the liquid evaporates over the long cook time. So you\u2019re left with greasy pasta with a vague taste of cheese and a huge smoke flavor. \n\nUsing a roux might have helped prevent the separation, but using Velveeta would have helped even more due to the sodium citrate in it. \n\nThis mac &amp; cheese looks mushy and greasy. No thanks.",

Best one I have done was use a crockpot recipe my wife uses a bunch with some small edits to it. Cooked macaroni, then added cheese (I did a mix of cheddar, munster, and havarti), butter, eggs, milk, cream, salt, pepper, msg, nutmeg, and ground mustard. I cold smoked this (it was for Christmas, so cool enough outside there was no food safety risk), then added a topping of bread crumbs, bacon, and parmesan and baked it in the oven. Reason for cold smoke/oven instead of hot smoke was I started it at our house in the morning and took it to the in laws for a supper.",

Instead of 3 cups of cheddar I did like a 1:1:2 ratio of munster/havarti/cheddar adding up to like 3.5-4 cups, one time I basically replaced the evaporated milk with cream because we were out (but did it with evaporated milk like 1.5 weeks ago, so both work), nutmeg and ground mustard wasn't much because I was just trying it and didn't want to over do it (I've seen it mentioned on reddit, so probably could find it somewhere to get an idea), MSG was like half the amount of salt. \n\nI cold smoked it with apple pellets in a smoke tube for like 1-1.5 hours stirring it around every 30ish minutes, added the topping (didn't measure, just an amount of panko that looked good slightly browned in butter with however much bacon seemed right and a sprinkle of shredded parm) then baked in the oven at 350 for around an hour or so until it looked good with maybe a few minutes of broiling to get the top more crispy.",

I\u2019ve been working on a new touring cooking show for the channel called \u201cTaste Bud Tours\u201d https://youtu.be/kaEnbhkfvYw\n\nI would love to know what you think! \n\nWatch the full video recipe here: https://youtu.be/SotrQQXNevE\n\nToday we are going to be making a delectable smoked mac and cheese. A dangerously tasty dish and an old favourite. \n\nIngredients \n\u2022 700g GF Macaroni\n\n\u2022 1kg Sharp Cheddar Cheese\n\n\u2022 1kg Grated Cheese of your choice\n\n\u2022 Bacon\n\n\u2022 4 cups of Milk\n\n\u2022 \u00bd tbsp Salt\n\n\u2022 \u00bd tbsp Pepper\n\n\u2022 \u00bd tbsp Sweet Paprika\n\n\u2022 \u00bd tbsp Garlic Powder\n\n\u2022 Bread Crumbs\n\n\u2022 Parmesan Cheese\n\nMethod\n\nStep 1 \nLet\u2019s begin by adding a chimney of charcoal to the bbq. \n\nStep 2\nNext, we\u2019re going to place our 1kg of sharp Cheddar Cheese in an aluminium baking tray followed by the 700g of Gluten Free Macaroni. \n\nStep 3\nThen we pour the 4 cups of milk over the macaroni and stir through. \n\nStep 4:\nSeason with\n\u00bd tbsp Salt\n\u00bd tbsp Pepper\n\u00bd tbsp Sweet Paprika\n\u00bd tbsp Garlic Powder\n\nStep 5\nTop with the 1kg grated Cheddar cheese. \n\nStep 6\nOkay, time to throw it into the bbq and replace the lid. \nSmoke for 1 and a half hours at 150 degrees Celsius or 300 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nStep 7\nWhile that\u2019s cooking let\u2019s chop up and cook off 1/2 kg of bacon. \n\nStep 8\nNext, we mix everything up and stir in the bacon. Cook for an additional 30 minutes. \n\nStep 9\nOkay, we\u2019re just about there!\nAdd breadcrumbs and grated parmesan on top.\n\nStep 10\nThis cheesy delight is absolutely to die for.",

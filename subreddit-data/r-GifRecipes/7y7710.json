            "comment": "Here is the recipe, from http://hostthetoast.com/pigs-blanket-baked-brie/ \n\n**INGREDIENTS**  \n\n1 (8 ounce) wheel brie cheese  \n2 premade circular pie crusts  \n1 clove garlic, minced  \n1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh chives  \n1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary  \n36 cocktail sausages (1 average pack)  \n1 egg yolk, beaten  \nSesame seeds and poppy seeds, optional  \n\n**INSTRUCTIONS**  \n  \nPreheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Line a baking sheet with parchment and set aside.  \nCarefully cut off and reserve the top of the brie. Place the brie round on one unrolled pie crust. Sprinkle the brie round with the garlic, chives, and rosemary. Place the top of the brie over the garlic mixture.  \nLay the second pie crust over the brie. Use your hand to gently press the edges against the brie and smooth up the sides. Make sure not to press down on the outer edges of the crust\u2013 just focus around the brie.  \nCut even-sized strips all around the brie, like a sun, making about 18 cuts in total. Place one cocktail sausage at the outer leftmost corner of one of the strips at a slight angle. Roll it inward to wrap in the pie dough and press the edges to seal. Continue all the way around until the first layer of strips are all wrapped around cocktail sausages. You may have to move the wrapped sausages gently in the process in order to fit others\u2013 that\u2019s okay.  \nContinue to wrap the bottom layer of strips around cocktail sausages and push the top layer above them in the process. Brush generously with egg yolk, and sprinkle with sesame seeds and poppy seeds, if desired.  \nCarefully transfer or slide the wrapped brie to the lined baking sheet. Bake the brie until the pastry is deep golden-brown, about 30 to 40 minutes.  \nAllow to cool 5 to 10 minutes to allow the cheese to firm up slightly.   Cut the top off of the baked brie and serve warm.  \n\nx-posted to /r/morganeisenberg",

Aged cheeses like cheddar and parmesan in particular get some of their flavour from the bacteria converting whatever lactose remains in the cheese, after much of it is removed along with the whey, to lactic acid. Fresh cheeses like mozzarella and cream cheese tend to have larger amounts of lactose because the culture hasn't had time to convert it all.\n\nThis isn't to say they have *no* lactose, particularly intolerant individuals may still have problems with even old cheeses, just that a lot of it is consumed by the cultures.",

The only reason I don't assemble the whole thing on parchment paper is that it's very easy to cut through the parchment paper and not realize it as you're making the slits in the dough, and then it can rip easily while you're transferring.

I think it appears to be a little undercooked due to the oils from the cheese and cocktail wieners and the fact that it doesn't get the egg yolk brush like the rest of the crust moreso than actual underbaking, but it can be a little bit doughy comparatively in places. Nothing that makes you take a bite and say \"oh, this is not done,\" though!",

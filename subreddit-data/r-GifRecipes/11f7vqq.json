They don\u2019t live long, only about 5 years even in captivity, but they\u2019re remarkably intelligent. They\u2019re emotionally intelligent, can solve complex physical puzzles, they dream, and they\u2019re quite playful - indicating they know play from fighting. I just can\u2019t eat them after reading that book. I used to love grilled octopus. Not anymore. \n\nP.s. in case you\u2019re wondering, the plural is octopuses and not octopi. Octopi has been used so much that it\u2019s accepted, but that\u2019s a Latin tail on a Greek root word. Doesn\u2019t make sense. So, octopuses.",

And I reckon that even the most dumbass of animals that we breed and then eat are probably not overly enjoying their existence under the conditions of industrial mass production. No exceptional emotional intelligence is required to recognize one's own suffering.",

If so that's probably worthy of a reconsideration given that a cow mother will react very visibly when one of her offspring dies.\n\nI don't know what the exact level of intelligence of a cow compared to an octopus is but I grew up in a small village in Germany and we had a farmer nearby who was adamant that cows were smarter than horses at least.\n\nWhich is why I said elsewhere that the intelligence we ascribe to different animals is a bad a measure. For one, we don't actually know, nor do we know how to evaluate certain astounding cognitive feats they pull off. Octopuses and squids are presumptively intelligent and it's been said that roughly half of their intelligence is in their tentacles alone (in how they are able to control each individual suction cup even as the arm may be severed from the body). And of course we are impressed by the fact that they can color-match their camouflage to their surrounding while their eyes themselves cannot actually perceive color.\n\nThis is clearly vastly different from how humans and primates in general function. But I don't see how that somehow translates to them being more worthy of being spared the cleaver in the kitchen.\n\nWhat I can intuitively say is that cows, to my eyes at least, react to distress more humanlike than cephalopods.",

I know for a fact that any produce bought from a big store generally has less taste.\n\nFor example my dad grows a few of his own things, garlic is one of them. They're like really tiny, about 1/4 the size of common garlic, but you only need to use 1/4 the amount of garlic bought from a store.\n\nAlso, I once made a lemon meringue, and I got the lemons from the garden of my aunt. Like real lemons, not the picture perfect lemons you find in the store. I would say my aunts lemons are also organic because she only waters the tree and nothing else.\n\nAnyway I followed the instructions from the recipe and squeezed the lemon juice as recommended and grated the amount of skin as suggested. The final result was just inedible. The lemons had so much flavor that it was just too empowering and I ended up throwing the whole thing away.\n\nNow if I want to follow a recipe, especially for sweets or cakes, I always use general products bought in a store.",

I like octopus, but this seems a bit overkill on the \"octopusiness.\"  I don't think the octopus poaching liquid translates to a tasty sauce as much as, say, a lobster or shrimp broth.  \n\nAlso, I'd balance and mellow it out with some more EVOO at the end.",

I\u2019m picking up a hand mixer today (because doing dough by hand led to some really uneven cookies) and a large size cookie sheet today because I apparently really enjoy baking. \n\nI\u2019m not brave enough for bread products yet and all my cake is made from a box as of right now.\n\nI am really happy to have stumbled across this recipe today because I wanted to try something new.

(1 1/2 sticks) butter, softened\n\n3/4 c. packed brown sugar\n\n1/2 c. granulated sugar, plus more for rolling\n\n1 large egg\n\n1 tsp. pure vanilla extract\n\n1 1/4 c. all-purpose flour\n\n3/4 c. cocoa powder\n\n3/4 tsp. baking soda\n\n3/4 tsp. kosher salt\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Directions**\n\n1. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Make filling: In a medium bowl, combine peanut butter and powdered sugar and mix until smooth. Using a 2-teaspoon cookie scoop, scoop into 22 small balls and freeze until hardened, 30 minutes.\n2. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0\n3. In a large bowl, combine butter, brown sugar, and sugar and beat until light and fluffy, then add egg and vanilla and mix until evenly combined. Add the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt and mix until evenly combined.\n4. Scoop a heaping tablespoon of the cookie dough and flatten into a pancake-like circle on the baking sheet. Place a frozen peanut butter ball on top. Bring the edges of the dough around the peanut butter ball and pinch the edges together to seal, adding more dough if necessary to cover the frozen peanut butter completely.\n5. Roll stuffed cookie dough ball in sugar and place back on prepared baking sheets. Repeat until all dough is used, spacing the cookies about 2\u201d apart.\n6. Bake until the cookies are set, about 12 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. ",

I shape the caramels into disks so the final product has a better cookie shape (and I keep the caramel at room temp the entire time).  Also, instead of rolling the stuffed cookies in sugar, I roll them in cocoa powder (for both types of cookies).  I have omitted the cocoa powder/sugar rolling stage at the end, but the final product bakes strangely.\n\nEither cookie is a huge hit with coworkers or at parties.  People always request that I make either the caramel or peanut butter stuffed chocolate cookies or [chocolate chip oatmeal cookies](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/chocolate-chip-oatmeal-cookies-recipe) by KAF.  I promise I don't work for KAF, in fact, I usually make this recipe change: store brand flour instead of KAF  haha\n\nHappy baking!",

Drying them out with the sugar makes them scoop-able into those balls.

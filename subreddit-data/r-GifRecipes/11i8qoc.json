            "comment": "Quick curious question (with caveat that I love italian cuisine and cook it often):\n\nLots of the italian recipes shown on r/gifrecipes seem to be fairly light and simple. ei. Also don't have much protein or veg.\n\nIs that a tradition/cultural thing of having more protein and veg in other meals?\nOr are these pasta dishes always an aside to other parts of a dinner/main meal?\n\nLike I quite often do light flavoured spaghetti dishes but then with fried fish/ other meat and some different roasted veg depending on what is in season.\n\n(or for in the uk where I am whats actually ripe and in stock atm).\n\nOr a more in one pan (at the end fried, roasted etc. seperately) example of just a rigatoni dish with a whole bunch meat, sauce and veg in one dish.",

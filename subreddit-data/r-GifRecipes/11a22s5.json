I was imagining something that looks identical to a sloppy joe, but with the meat made of frozen hot dogs cut up into tiny slices.   \nFollowing my above carbonara rule, not a bad idea for a food, but if I ordered a hot dog and got this sloppy joe thing instead, I'd be very confused.  \n\nAt a certain point, things just need different names.",

Do any of the other videos I made look any better?\n\nAlso, the photos I took for this dish, and other dishes on my website are complete garbage. To improve them I bought some nice rustic plates and I'm placing the plates on a dark background, that seems to help for the photos. Still not uploaded any of the improved photos though.\n\nI'm using final cut pro for editing, I'll follow what your advice in the next video. But I think the biggest problem in this particular video is the lighting.\n\nThankyou, I truly appreciate",

The debate here is that some people believe that a \"grilled cheese sandwich\" can only be made out of bread and cheese toasted in a pan with butter/mayo/oil/whatever fat you like. Those people think that adding anything else to that combo turns it into a \"melt\".\n\nI will grant that both arguments are silly, but I would submit that \"carbonara\" has a more specific meaning than \"grilled cheese\" does. \n\nI guess my question to you would be, is this still a carbonara if you didn't add the eggs? You could easily make a very similar sauce without egg in this. Why isn't this just Corned Beef and Pumpkin Penne?",

I just don't think you'll get many people to agree that \"carbonara\" includes corned beef, pumpkin and gorgonzola. Simply including eggs in the recipe doesn't make it a carbonara, does it? If that's your rationale, you could also call this a \"Corned Beef and Pumpkin Cheesecake with Penne\". Cheesecake has both cheese and eggs in it, so if what we call a dish doesn't really mean anything, then you can call it anything.\n\nI wouldn't call a sandwich with ham and cheese heated on a griddle a \"cheese melt\". At the same time, I don't think that's wrong, *per se*,  it's just not very descriptive. But then again, if you offered someone a \"cheese melt\" and then put ham in it, they might be upset because they don't eat pork. \n\nPersonally, I would call melted cheese with ham inside bread sandwich a Grilled Ham and Cheese. Or, if I was feeling spicy, I might say \"Ham and Cheese Melt\". \n\nIt's okay to use the techniques and change up ingredients, but when you call it by a classic and well known name, people *expect* something. And in a carbonara, no one expects pumpkin, corned beef or the Spanish Inquisition.",

I've never heard of carbonara being made with gorgonzola. If the only thing that makes the sauce a \"carbonara\" is the eggs - since it doesn't contain a hard cheese or pepper - is it a carbonara sauce? \n\nLike you can't give someone a piece of roasted chicken in a bun with a some hot sauce and call it a Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich.

At least you don't need another pot just to boil some pumpkin.\n\nHowever, I don't think you would want to add the pumpkin at the same time you add the pasta. It would probably just get too cooked and once added to pan pan may break up.\n\nBut then again, these are all preferences.\n\nJust to let you know, the corned beef and also parmesan make this dish rather salty. So don't add any salt at any point, even for the pasta, use just a pinch of salt.\n\nOr if you want to minimize the saltiness, try using a less salty corned beef.",

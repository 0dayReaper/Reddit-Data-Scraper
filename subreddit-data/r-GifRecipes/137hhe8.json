My guess is chef is Gujarati and is making a new creation.  \n\n\nIn Gujarat we call pakoras \"bhajia\" typically, and we also use sesame seeds often in our snack dishes. Sometimes our food can a sweet/savory combo like this one, but not all the time.  \n\n\nThere is a Gujarati bhajia dish called kela methi na bhajia (banana &amp; fenugreek) bhajia. This looks like a variation of that but healthier with more added vegetables.  \n\n\nPunjabi food isn't the only type of Indian food out there, but unfortunately in the west it's the most known, second place being South Indian food. It's rare for me to find traditional Gujarati restaurants out here or rare for people to know what is traditionally Guajarati food (if they aren't Gujarati themselves)",

I only mentioned it because the title says bhajia / pakora specifically (not bhajji or bhaja) so that's why I had a suspicion it could be Gujarati, especially with the sesame seed addition.  \n\n\nI think it looks good but I wouldn't know til I try it myself! I personally haven't had this many veggie combinations in bhajia before but it may be tasty. Also I don't think mild spices means Gujarati specifically, Kathiaywadi food for example where I'm from and is known to be very spicy! It all depends where in Gujarat I suppose.",

Along with that, it isn't uncommon for Lnfinity's submissions to also skimp out on basics that are a significant part of a dish and what makes them good.\n\nFor the record, there's a lot of good vegan food out there - both that tries to imitate dishes with substitutions and just good food that happens to be vegan. My main issue with this recipe are the lack of spices and if the recipe is using plantains, at least specifying that somewhere beyond just saying \"banana\".",

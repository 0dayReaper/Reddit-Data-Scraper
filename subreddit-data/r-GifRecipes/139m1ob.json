Add the tomatoes and cucumbers in a large bowl, add 1 tsp salt to this and toss well. Let this rest for 30 minutes to draw out the liquid from it. This step is optional but highly recommended as it helps keep the salad non-soggy and tastes better for longer.\n2.  After 30 minutes or more, drain the liquid that is left in the tomatoes and cucumbers by passing them through a large sieve or colander. Set aside.\n3.  Wash the peanuts and then add enough water and 1 tsp salt to cook the peanuts. You can pressure cook for 12 minutes or boil in a pan for 25 minutes.\n4.  Let the steam release naturally and then drain the peanuts onto a colander.\n5.  Once the peanuts cool down, add them to a large bowl (large enough to toss everything together) and add the rest of the ingredients along with the cucumbers and tomatoes.\n6.  Taste for salt and only add if it feels less because the veggies were salted and the peanuts were cooked in salt too.\n7.  Toss well and serve. It can also be refrigerated and enjoyed for the next few days.\n\n[Source](https://beextravegant.com/healthy-boiled-peanut-salad/)",

Just brown some hamburger, chop up an onion and brown it... I eventually started putting some minced garlic in as well. Once it\u2019s all cooked up, put in 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, let it go until it is all incorporated, and last thing as you take it off the heat it toss in a solid chunk of sour cream. Pour that creamy, gooey concoction over some egg noodles and feast. \nI have also made it as a casserole by mixing the sauce into the noodles and topping it with French\u2019s onions. \nIt most certainly is not authentic, but it beats out hamburger helper any day of the week, and damn is it delicious. \nI also sometimes substitute the cream of mushroom for cream of onion, since I love onion and am not as big a fan of mushrooms.",

The brandy/cornstarch/beef/butter are technically optional. They are just to deglaze the beef fond from the pan, and add some mouth feel. I do it all in one pan, and it really takes 15 minutes or less, especially if you buy pre-sliced mushrooms. I used to buy whole until I realized it was the same price per pound to get pre washed and sliced..",

Melt butter in sauce pan and brown meat, dump into crock pot\n2. Slice the onion (thin) and put in crock pot with flour, stir\n3. Add the rest of the ingredients EXCEPT paprika and sour cream\n4. Cook on low for 7-8 hours or high for 4 hours\n5. Once done cooking add paprika and sour cream, stir\n6. Add cooked rice (or noodles) , let sit to thicken (that's for the rice mostly)\n\nThis recipe can easily be doubled which we would do to feed the whole family but then you have TONS of leftovers but it's also delicious leftover so it works well!

I've done it multiple times, it's really, really great.\n\nIngredients :\n\n- 45ml (3tbsp) flour\n- 675g of beef sirloin (cut it in strips)\n- 45ml (3tbsp) of oil\n- 2 minced onions\n- 454g of white mushrooms, cut/minced\n- 45ml (3tbsp) of butter\n- 3 minced garlic cloves\n- 125ml of red wine\n- 250ml of beef stock\n- 15ml (1tbsp) of \"old fashioned\"/seeded/wholegrain/stoneground mustard ([this kind](https://statics.monoprix.fr/course/g_637_moutarde-a-l-ancienne.jpg?t=20150826110711))\n- 2.5ml (1/2 tsp) paprika\n- 180ml (3/4cup) of yoghurt\n- Parsley\n- Chive\n- Salt &amp; Pepper\n\nSteps :\n\n1. Cover the meat with the flour \n2. Sear the meat in a large pan, in the oil. Salt and pepper as you do so. Do it little by little, transferring the meat into the slow cooker as soon as it's seared.\n3. In the same pan (don't use another one), cook the onions and make them golden, together with the mushrooms and the butter. Salt and pepper. Add the garlic and continue cooking one minute. Deglaze with the red wine (that's why we kept the same pan) and put all of that in the slow cooker. Add the rest of the ingredients in it, except for the yoghurt and the herbs. Make sure everything is nicely mixed (and not layered) in the slow cooker.\n4. Cover and cook 4 hours at low heat.\n5. When you serve, add the yoghurt, salt and pepper if needed and place on the pasta. Add the herbs according to your taste.\n\nThat's it, it's a bit more elaborate than the typical \"throw in and cook\" slow cooker recipe but it's really worth the prepping time it takes (not even that long, really). Don't forget cutting the meat in strips against the grain so it's properly tender. Hope that was clear enough, my culinary vocabulary isn't great in English.",

Cajun seasoning or cayenne pepper for more spiciness). Also helps insulate a bit the meat so it doesn't cook too much inside, but just gives a crust. Oh god this bullet point has gone too long what am I doing with my life\n\nSource: Can't cook well\n",

Cut the sirloin steak into thin strips and season it with salt and pepper.\n    \n2. Heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a heavy skillet over medium high heat. Add the steak strips in a single layer, and let them cook undisturbed for about 1 minute to get a good sear. Flip them and cook until browned, about another 2 minutes. Remove the steak from the pan and transfer it to a separate plate.\n    \n3. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to the skillet. Add the onions and saut\u00e9 for 2 to 4 minutes, or until the onions start to turn translucent.\n    \n4. Add the mushrooms, season them with salt, and cook for 5 minutes, or until the mushrooms and onions are cooked and nicely browned.\n    \n5. Add the garlic and cook for another minute or until fragrant.\n    \n6. Add the brandy (or other alcohol) to deglaze the pan, making sure to scrape up the browned bits off the bottom. Let the mixture cook for another 2 to 4 minutes until the liquid has reduced by about a third.\n    \n7. In a large bowl, whisk together the beef broth, soy sauce, mustard, and cornstarch (or flour) until smooth. Set aside.\n    \n8. Add the beef broth mixture to the skillet, and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened slightly.\n    \n9. Turn the heat to low, and stir in the sour cream (or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche/Greek yogurt) until combined.\n    \n10. Return the cooked steak to the pan and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the steak is heated through. Taste and adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if needed.\n\n**Chef\u2019s Tip:**\n\n* To make it easier to slice the beef, place the sirloin steak in the freezer about 1 \u2013 2 hours before you want to begin making your stroganoff (until it is just partially frozen) then slice it thinly.

Usually adding wine or liquor to a sauce is just trying to add a bit of body to it to give it a sort nuanced or robust flavor than just your standard chicken or beef stock flavor. So sometimes you can just add a splash of some apple juice or cranberry juice to a dish to give it that little extra \"something, something\" flavor that leaves people guessing. They also make brandy and cognac extracts that just take a little splash to add the same flavor minus the alcohol. ",

I use apple cider vinegar, personally, but some alcoholics won't even use that as there is almost always alcohol in vinegar, albeit in small amounts. I don't use wine vinegar (red, white, rice) for fear of triggering a taste memory, but apple cider vinegar seems to work for me.\n\nIf you want to avoid vinegar altogether, you can also generally substitute any other acidic liquid. Lemon juice when heavily diluted with water can work really well for deglazing and adding some kick to the recipe.\n\nIf the acid isn't needed (like if there's something else bringing acid to the table - don't neglect your dish's acid as tastes can't pop without it!) then broth works great for deglazing and will also help the body.\n\nFor THIS dish, I would use stock to deglaze but probably also add some extra generous dashes of Worcestershire sauce, because that has flavors of both acid and savory. I'm kinda nuts about Worcestershire sauce though and tend to add it to almost everything - not everyone agrees.",

When putting your beef in the freezer for 15, pull the sour cream out, personally I use heavy cream. Alternatively you could temper the cream by adding in small amounts of the hot liquid stirring it in to raise the temperature. But I have not had issues with room tempish cream being slowly added. \n\nAlso I wouldn't use cornstarch, this sauce can easily reduce to thicken which improves the flavour. Just dredge the beef in flour after slicing if you don't want to try a reduction. I also don't season the meat at this step, because I can season the sauce and it have the same result. I feel frozen or very cold thin strips of ~~beer~~ beef don't really gain the benefit of being seasoned as much as a steak or thicker cut of meat would. ",

It's super easy to make lasts a long time in the fridge (like 3 weeks if tightly sealed), and it tastes way better.  You can customize the \"sourness\" depending on how long you let it sit.  I have a friend who hates store bought sour cream, i shared this with him and he keeps it in his fridge all the time to add to sauces.\n\nAdditionally the stroganoff recipe is the best I've ever had.\nhttp://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2011/03/no-russian-this-beef-stroganoff-recipe.html",

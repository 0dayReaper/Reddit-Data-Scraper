It was so traumatizing\\*, we still taunt him about it...\n\n\\* (I seriously cringed when they started shaping the meat and I realized where the video was going)\n\nThing is, he'd done exactly what the recipe said - it just was a crappy recipe that forgot to write that the minced meat were supposed to be browned before putting it into the dough and baking it - like you're supposed to when you're making pirogs. These days, he makes proper pirogs by browning the minced meat before baking, and they taste great... \n\n(I have no idea what pirog is in English - they look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/RL4Ibh3.jpg) in Sweden)\n\nTake that recipe, but brown and spice the minced meat properly, with the chopped onions, and then throw in the chopped pickles, replace that horrible cheese that look like some sort of toxic sludge with some normal cheese (or just completely skip it), maybe add some mushrooms to the minced meat, and don't do a big loaf but instead smaller buns, and you have yourself some tasty pirogs - perfect to eat cold on a picnic, hike, fishing trip, etc, or as a proper meal when they are warm from the oven...

Just having it on the side for dipping would be way more enjoyable.\n\nThen again, I'd rather just eat a damn cheeseburger instead of this kooky ass Pinterest bullshit.",

(They still are generally known for having bit guts due to drinking wine and such) but the portion difference is ridiculous.\n\nI remember when I went to Del Taco and got a small drink here in the states. When they gave me their small, I thought they gave me a large cup. I then let them know because I was afraid they charged me for a large meal instead of a small meal. And apparently their medium cup is huge and their large was just insane compared to what I expected.\n\nAnd I think over time, it's not just portions of food to get distorted, but the expectations of the human body. If you see enough morbidly obese people, then overweight people don't look so bad. Fat people start to look normal while morbidly huge people look fat.\n\nI've noticed a few times while looking at people discussing obesity and looking at pictures of fat people and they looked normal to me. That's when I had to reaffirm to myself that it wasn't the case and I would have realized they were fat back in the day.\n\nI think that's part of the obesity problem in general. Many people don't think they're fat until they're way too fat. It's harder to lose 150 pounds than 25 pounds and off-putting.\n\nAnd then I think a lot of nutrition information needs to be studied better and retaught. The food pyramid is essentially a scam that was made by the government to help certain farming industries. People seem to avoid fatty foods when there's absolutely nothing wrong with fat in foods but the sugar lobby made sure public perception of fat was vilified as the cause of obesity when it really wasn't.\n\nIn fact, fatty foods help keep you satiated for longer. If you eat a salad for lunch, you have fewer calories. But then after a while, you start getting hungry and it's harder to keep that diet because you just want some salad and fruits and fat free yogurt instead of a hearty meal. It makes it easier for you get hungry and cave in, eating terrible food. With fatty foods, you can sustain your hunger more easily and not feel the constant need to snack and you're not counting the clock until your next meal. \n\nWith all of these distortions of food and people and even what we know about nutrition in America, that's just a few parts of what I'm sure is a hugely complicated issue.\n\nIf one person is fat, they're fat and lack control. If the majority of a nation is morbidly obese, it's an epidemic and should be studied so we can try to find out why it's happening and how to best approach fixing issues.",

Something bad happens in your life and it sucks but hey this mac and cheese is pretty tasty so I'm just going to eat it all up. \n\n* Louis CK sums it up pretty well here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuO4OZJ5ncY\n\nI just wanted to add that I've finally started turning my life around quite a bit and I'm down 20 lbs from 300 to 280 over the course of like 2 months so I'm pretty happy about that.",

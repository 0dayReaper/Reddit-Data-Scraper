Combine the ingredients needed for sauce \u2013 light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, shaoxing wine, sugar, and water.\n2.  Cut your tofu into square slices.\n3.  Combine the frying batter: corn starch, onion powder, garlic powder and 5 spices. Mix well.\n4.  Coat the tofu squares evenly and pan fry them until crispy for a few minutes on each side.\n5.  On another pan, add sesame oil. Once the sesame oil starts to heat up, add ginger slides and green chili. Saute until they're fragrant.\n6.  Add back your tofu slices and give them a good toss.\n7.  Add in your sauce mixture. Mix well and leave the mixture on very low heat.\n8.  If you have leftover corn starch, gather about 1 tbsp and mix it in a splash of water until you get a slurry. Add it to the tofu dish.\n9.  Mix well until the mixture starts to thicken. If it's too thick, add a splash of water. If too thin, add more of the corn starch slurry.\n10.  Add in basil leaves and toss until they are cooked and combine well with the dish. Serve with rice or noodles for a hearty meal!\n\n[Source](https://browngirlveganeats.com/three-cup-san-bei-tofu/)",

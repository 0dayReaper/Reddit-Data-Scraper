I would just watch it carefully because once it separates the big mass of butter sloshes in the liquid and it could splash everywhere, but it is super cool and worth it. Another tip I would add is if you are salting the butter itself go very conservative, because my first time it was horribly over salted and made it inedible.",

This recipe is as easy as putting heavy cream in a food processor and letting it go.\n\nThe final product produces a high quality, high flavor butter. But remember this is unsalted so either 1. add 1/4 tsp fine salt and then adjust for your taste or 2. add flaky salt to whatever you're eating. I prefer number 2 since if I'm using this it's with a recipe where you can really taste the butter- buttered toast, scrambled eggs, or a butter forward pasta sauce.\n\nAlso, the byproduct of this recipe is buttermilk. This isn't going to be the tangy sour buttermilk you're used to unless you use cultured cream. I didn't do this for my recipe but the Kitchn has a great article about it [here](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-butter-and-cultured-butter-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-194372).\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",

Use it to make a cheese sauce without having to fuss with a ruex and bechamel. \n\nAlso great in tea and coffee. Just don't use nearly as much as you would milk or even half and half.\n\nClotted cream is also a very tasty dessert (although also very heavy)\n\nImo these are better uses than making butter. Homemade butter will also spoil rather quick if you don't rigorously wash all of the buttermilk and milk solids out.",

Get the cream in the bowl and started the whisk/whip going medium. 10 seconds later the chef asked me to do something. \"Yes, chef\". I don't remember what it was, but it was time intensive. Next thing I know, the owner/manager comes to me asking for the whipped cream. \"Sure, no problem\". I grab a rubber scraper and a container and head to the mixing station, thinking to myself, its gotta be done by now. We arrive at the mixer, both look in the bowl. Sure enough sweet cream butter...

We can work with that.\n\nYou might try this sequence:\n\n1. Mushrooms, sliced.  Saut\u00e9 in butter until well browned. If you cook them long enough, they'll get a bit chewy, and taste quite meaty. A pinch of salt at the start will help this along.\n\n2. When the mushrooms are browned, add the chicken. A bit of extra butter in the pan, and seasoning the chicken pieces well will help them develop some color.\n\n3. Once the chicken is golden brown, reduce the heat a bit and add your onions.  As they soften, they'll pick up the brown bits on the bottom.  Add the garlic about 1 minute before the onions are done.\n\n4. Now add your sauce elements: sour cream, pasta water, cheese. Keep scraping the bottom to get all the browned bits.\n\n5. Broccoli and pasta do to your liking, as before.\n\nEt voila! No extra pans, no pulling stuff out in between.

In practice, it boils things from the inside, which is its strength and also its limitation.\n\nI mainly use it to warm things and it is a formidable tool for that. Like left-overs, frozen things, or to warm the half-a-cup of milk to mix with my espresso for my basic Italian breakfast (milk+coffee and 2 cookies).\n\nOccasionally I use it to obtain rapidly boiled potatoes or to boil one cup of water for a tea (only if I'm sick). \n(To cook vegetables usually I still prefer steam in the pressure cooker)\n\nWhen I was younger I explored its cooking capability a bit more, but now I'm kind of lazy in that regard. Still, I can't live without it. But it is true that it can not cook everything: you can't use it to fry or grill things (but there are combined models which more capabilities).",

Infrared (like in a halogen oven) doesn't penetrate deeply at all, so it causes the surface layer to get hot first. Microwaves have a penetration depth of about 3cm, so it is about 3cm from the surface that gets hot first.\n\nMicrowave ovens have been used for a century and more, and there's absolutely zero evidence that they cause any negative transformations in your food, and zero theoretical reason to believe they would. \n\nMicrowaved eggs *are* terrible, though.",

Liquids most easily excite this way, so any moisture in the food will heat the food internally. Whereas the dish does not have retained moisture so it will not easily heat from the microwave.  \n  \nJust as a note, despite the microwave using radiation as its heating method, it does NOT irradiate your food. It can potentially however do funny things to plastics so it is not recommended to microwave food in plastic containers. Best is to use glass, followed by ceramic.",

But the idea that any improvement to your video world result in professional quality has to be a joke.\n\nHere, let's start with a [simple lesson](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-salty-should-pasta-water-be) on salting water. Your cooking will still be far from professional chef quality, but at least you'll never cook bland pasta again.\n\nAlso, never again use your thumb for a cutting board, don't press garlic onto your phone, and zoom out a bit more. There, video quality and knife skills are still miles away from professional quality, but there will be marked improvements.",

Cooking the broccoli in the pasta water easily leads to overcooked broccoli. It only needs a short blanch.\n4. Not properly cooking the mushrooms will make them soggy and they will release tons of water watering down the sauce\n5. Too little sauce overall and not tossing the pasta around enough for the sauce to become creamier.\n6. The chicken is not properly browned, you are losing tons of flavor this way.\n7. The onions are diced way too roughly and not properly cooked down. For a dish like this caramelizing them would add subtle sweetness.\n8. Where is the seasoning? A dish like this needs salt, pepper, maybe some (smoked) paprika but also herbs. A handful of parsley would go a long way. Thyme could also work really well. A splash of white wine, lemon or balsamic would also massively enhance the dish.",

My recipe:\n\n1/2 lb chicken breast (or ground chicken, ground turkey, ground beef, bacon)\n\n2 cup sliced mushroom 0.5cm thick.\n\n1 1/2 cup broccoli (split heads)\n\n4 cloves garlic finely chopped\n\nOnion: I don't use, but try 1/2 cup finely chopped white\n\n1/3-1/2 lb pasta\n\n1/2 cup heavy whipping cream\n\n1/2-3/4 cup shredded parmesan\n\n1/4 cup chopped parsley.\n\nChilli flakes to taste\n\nOil (Olive oil best)\n\n\nStart boiling water with 1 tbsp salt. Warm water saves time.\n\nSaute mushrooms (and onion if using) in 1-2 tbsp oil, salt and pepper. After a minute, add garlic and saute. After a minute, cover and simmer for 4 mins.\n\nBy now water should be boiling. Add pasta. The clock is on! You have to finish the rest before the pasta is almost done.\n\nRemove mushrooms with juice from pan and set aside.\n\nAdd 1 tbsp oil. Stirfry protein. 2 mins before done, add broccoli.\n\nAdd the mushrooms back with juice. Add cream. If using dry seasoning instead of fresh, add now. Cover and simmer until pasta is almost done cooking. Don't let it fully cook.\n\nDrain pasta and add it to protein and mix. Use your judgement for adding some pasta water. Medium heat until bubbles start again.\n\nTake off heat, add cheese, fresh seasoning, and chilli flakes and mix until cheese melts into cream to make sauce. Wait until pasta absorbs more water and sauce has thickened to satisfaction.\n\nServe immediately.\n\nI have made this 20+ times. Takes about 15-18 mins of cooking. Best taste comes from unburnt mushroom with juice, gently cooked crunchy broccoli, good parmesan, and perfectly thick sauce.",

The butter just melts right away and the brown sugar mixture no longer has anything to hold it in place so it just looks on the griddle. A kitchen torch might work.",

However, it's not burnt usually. Instead of melted butter, we use whipped butter for the swirl part, so I feel like that affects the meltiness of the butter and how burnt or crunchy it gets.",

At this point, I don't know if I would like to become a chef (I'm graduating with my degree in public health this year with no idea what to do with it), but I've thought about the idea of becoming a food writer. But I don't know how to possibly get into such a thing. Maybe I should just do it and pursue my dream in food. :) Thanks for the encouragement.",

Don't worry if nobody reads it today, it's just more content for your readers that find you next year. You could do it once a month even, do it on vacation, or after each exam have a nice meal to celebrate and start talking about them. The worst case is you've a hobby you enjoy.

If it's a dream of yours I would definitely say do it. Eating food is something we all have done forever and will continue to do, everyone. Sewing, mining, other professions not so much... But eating, we all eat and food taste so damn good. I guess what I'm trying to say is we all act like we're going to live forever.

The logic being that it helps my liver produce glycogen that would get me through morning workouts. It also helps me get good sleep, so when I wake up I'm sleepy but energized, instead of alert and exhausted like I used to be before I started a routine of using honey.",

One recipe for pancakes that I use is almond flour and a small amount of coconut flour along with eggs, some milk and a sprinkling of a granulated monkfruit-erythritol sweetener (sugar alcohols process differently,  watch out for diarrhea). Then for the topping i use powdered peanutbutter, heavy whipping cream, chocolate and/or cinnamon and some more monkfruit and mix it up into a peanutbutter like consistency. The topping will melt thick and syrupy and it's so good.",

Well listen here you little shit cause we're going on a journey to flavourtown as we explore this gif recipe play-by-play.\n\nFirst up, you shove some pancake batter on a hot pan. Fucked if I'm gonna tell you what goes in the damn pancake batter. Could be flour, water, egg; could be salmon filet and cat shit. I don't give a fuck.\n\nNext, you're gonna melt about 2 teaspoons of butter in a colossal glass bowl, just enough to make a small pool at the bottom. Why a gigantic bowl for such small quantities you ask? Well slow the fuck down there mate we'll get to that in a second.\n\nNext you're going to hire a 2 tonne excavator and put that bad boy to use. If you start at 4am in the morning you may have just enough time before breakfast to shovel enough brown sugar into that monumental glass bowl we talked about earlier. Don't you dare let me catch you trying to put any white sugar in there, you damn racist.\n\nAdd a hint of cinnamon for flavour.\n\nNow mix that shit. Literally. Mix it until it looks like your toilet bowl after a hard night of shoving rum and tacos down your gullet, you disgusting animal.\n\nNext, pour your horrible diarrhea mix into a plastic bag. No, not for tidy disposal, you absolute mongoloid. The next step involves you cutting a hole in the bottom of your plastic garbage bag and making a gay little swirl on your pancake, which has now been cooking for the past 3 years while you throw the rest of this godforsaken recipe together.\n\nNow flip that bad boy so the shit swirl cooks nice and gently into whatever you threw into your pancake batter at the beginning.\n\nBUTTER + CREAM CHEESE - ROOM TEMPERATURE. Need I say more?\n\nTime to whip out that excavator, because the sugar train just pulled back in with a fresh load baby. Absolutely bury that moist, creamy, semen mixture that you just created in the previous step with all of that wholesome, nutritious powdered ~~crack~~ sugar.\n\nAdd three atoms of vanilla essence and stir.\n\nIf you find that your mixture isn't turning into a creamy delight because the powder to moisture ratio doesn't make any fucken sense at all then don't fret! You have two easy ways out of this conundrum:\n\n* just keep mixing harder and harder you little pussy. Eventually the powder will super heat and enter a liquid form. Or it may explode. I don't know how physics works, I'm just a gif recipe maker.\n\n* super cut the gif and it'll just magic itself into some delicious looking goo.\n\nNext, add a thimbleful of milk to that gooey mess just to stick it to the cows for once and show them how unimportant their rancid milk is to our species' survival.\n\nNow, if you turn back to your shit stained pancakes you'll find they're already cooked nicely and plated. Look at them sitting there, those smug bastards.\n\nFinally, drizzle your sugar bukkake juice onto your pancakes so it looks like your mum's chin on a friday night.\n\nEnjoy your 'breakfast' you fat fucking sugar fiend.",

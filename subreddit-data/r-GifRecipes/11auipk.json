Basically garlic cooks faster than other vegetables, but if you have enough vegetables in a pan, there is enough moisture to prevent the garlic from burning. So if you have a crowded pan it's fine, otherwise only put the garlic in when you are close to finishing the dish or when you are about to add liquid.",

A few notes which I think could improve it\n\nOne, I\u2019d start with the meat, then remove it from the pan when browned to cook vegetables so they cook in its fat and gain more flavor.\n\nSecond, after the mire poix (which id start with just onion, then celery, then carrot), I\u2019d do the mushrooms alone with plenty of room to cook the moisture out and improve their texture. Then broccoli by itself, if not just take broccoli out and serve on the side to avoid the fish feeling crowded.\n\nI would only add the cream at the very end, once everything is cooked and returned to the pan, and with the heat off of very low.\n\nThat bubbling you see is the cream curdling, which reduces the creaminess and gives it that cottage cheese texture. Definitely not my preferred texture in a creamy pasta dish.\n\nI\u2019d also finish with grated parm and black pepper",

Could have even done the dried tomatoes with the meat and mushrooms... You'd probably end up with a deeper color of creme at the end, but it really does matter.   Maybe add chicken stock to the veg at the end and cooked it out mostly for more flavor.  Herbs and creme at the end and toss in pasta.\n\nLooks good either way.  Perfection is unattainable.  Home cooked meals with fresh unprocessed foods is always top notch.",

It would add a ton of depth to the flavor, and requires very little wine",

You also shouldn't be deglazing the pan with cream first when you can get all the flavor up with some stock or even just pasta water before adding the cream. \n\nYour knife skills are great as well but a larger blade would probably make your work a bit faster and more consistent as well.",

Just like how risotto is flavored with stock (and wine) because the rice absorbs it all, so too can pasta.\n\nAlso, \"Italian seasoning\" is often a blend of three or four herbs (basil, oregano, thyme, marjoram, or rosemary are common) that work well together.

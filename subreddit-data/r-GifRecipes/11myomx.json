Its supposed to be **constantly whisked** and have the cream/milk added in half cup increments *while still whisking* so you don't drop the temp too much. You lazily stirred it together with a spoon. Also you're supposed to add the cheese to the b\u00e8chamel off of the heat, not still on the stove top. Notice how clumpy and full of lumps the sauce was when you poured over the pasta? That's because you're roux was broken from the start from poor technique.\n\nA proper cheese sauce will still be gooey letting it cool to room temp. I'm sure it still tastes fine, but you did basically every step incorrectly to have a properly textured sauce.",

                    "comment": "Blue cheese mac &amp; cheese can be amazing. I think in OP's recipe it'll probably get a bit lost, but if you make a good creamy bechamel and include some ingredients which have enough sweetness to cut through the richness of the cheese &amp; sauce it can be so good.\n\n I have a recipe that does it brilliantly:  \n- Cook 200g of pasta (I like conchiglie, you do you) til al dente, then drain and set aside. Finely dice a red onion and sweat it til soft and translucent. Set aside.  \n- In the same pan, melt 30g butter. Add 30g flour and stir until golden and the rawness is fully cooked out of the flour. Longer cooking gives darker roux.  \n- Slowly add a pint of milk, 100ml or so at a time. Whisk constantly. Once all the liquid is in, stir regularly til the sauce comes to a gentle simmer.  \n- Remove from heat, and add 100g of crumbled blue cheese and the onion from earlier. Stir til melted and combined.  \n- Add the cooked pasta and stir til combined. Pour into an oven proof dish and top with 30g of chopped walnuts.  Bake for 10 mins or so. Serve with roasted vegetables (broccoli goes great).",

Striving for perfection often results on giving up altogether.\n\nInstead I focus on making meals that are good and tasty, and fast. And if that means I have to remove a certain ingredient from the original recipe, that is what I'll do, especially if the final result is similar but the process is more convenient.",

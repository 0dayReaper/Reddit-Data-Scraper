They're not really washing it in the sense of trying to clean it. Plenty of raccoons have been observed eating earthworms covered with dirt. It was also theorized they lacked saliva glands, but that's also not true. The best theory is that raccoons just like the way it feels. \n\nRaccoons have a strong sense of touch in their hands that resembles primates. Having wet hands stimulates this in their hands. Touch something with dry fingers and then lick your fingers and touch it again (note: do not touch a person). You'll notice they feel a bit different. Touch is a part of how a raccoon enjoys food, so they enjoy it more when things are wet.\n\n[Source](http://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/raccoons-wash-food.htm)\n\n",

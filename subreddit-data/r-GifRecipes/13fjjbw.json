                    "comment": "Independent of this recipe, my go-to is medium firm tofu. I don't press mine out, but I do dry the outside so it browns better.  \nI pan fry my tofu over medium high heat for 7-10 mins per side (two sides) - enough to get a golden crust on it. This helps tremendously with the texture, as it's less mushy and has a bite to it. You don't want to be aggressive with the frying, just let it go for long enough until the browned parts have a crust. And don't move pieces until they have formed that crust, otherwise you'll have a mess.   \n\nA few recipes I like:  \nKorean [dubu-jorim](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/dubu-jorim)  \nVarious chinese stir fried tofu recipes [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vWIenK4p60). The last one is personally my favorite, but I also like the first with the spiced seasoning.    \n\nHonestly you could toss the tofu in whatever sauce or seasoning you want. The important part is to prep it properly.",

The only point where I differ is that I think pressing tofu is silly. I haven't found it to make much difference, and most Chinese don't do it. Nor does one need a coating of starch for frying--just a little patience, as the comment above suggests.",

Preheat oven to 425F. Take your pressed tofu and tear it into 1 inch chunks with your hands into a large bowl. Drizzle with the tamari and avocado oil, then evenly sprinkle the cornstarch, nutritional yeast, white pepper and five spice over top. Toss the tofu to evenly coat.\n    \n2.  Spread the tofu in an even layer on a baking tray and place in the oven to bake for 30 minutes, flipping halfway.\n    \n3.  Meanwhile, in a measuring cup add the miso paste, sugar, tamari, and mirin. With a spoon lightly mash the mixture together. Add the water and vigorously whisk together until smooth. In a separate small bowl combine the cornstarch with 2 tbsp of water, whisking well until smooth.\n    \n4.  Heat up a skillet with cooking oil over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the white portion of the scallions, garlic, ginger and the chilies and saut\u00e9 until fragrant.\n    \n5.  Pour the miso sauce into the pan and stir well into the aromatics until it starts to simmer. Pour in the cornstarch, turn the heat low then continue to stir for about 5 mins or until the sauce begins to thicken to your liking.\n    \n6.  Stir in the tofu and coat with the sauce. Serve garnished with remaining scallions and enjoy as desired.\n    \n\n[Source](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsABQPapIVU/)",

Here is a recipe:\n\n* 3 eggs\n\n* 1/4 onion, diced\n\n* 1-2 green chilis, chopped (these are the hot varieties you'll find in ethnic stores. Alternatively you can substitute with habaneros or any high capsaicin variety. YMMV)\n\n* curry leaves, 2-3 chopped (you'll find these at Indian stores)\n\n* ghee/butter/oil (more the better)\n\n* salt \n\n---\n\n* Crack the eggs in a bowl and whisk them.\n\n* Add the onions, chilis, salt, and curry leaves and whisk some more until well incorporated.\n\n* Heat a frying pan and add the fat. Wait until it is sufficiently warm (if using butter, I watch for the first sign of smoke)\n\n* Pour the batter...and then do wtv you do with omelets.\n\n---\n\nIf this interests you, you may check out [akuri](http://www.parsicuisine.com/traditional-parsi-akuri-made-the-old-fashioned-way-and-with-the-old-fashioned-taste/), another Indian egg dish.",

In the Tamil language it is known as *karugapillai* which probably is how it got butchered into curry leaf. \n\nIt's slightly earthy, has an interesting nutty flavor too. I know hipster bars that are using it muddled in cocktails! ",

The sad truth is that in some places you don't want to do that because it will just get the person robbed by other homeless people, or it will get you in trouble with police even though you're not doing anything wrong. The world is not sunshine and butterflies, and you're better off donating things to a non-profit organization that has the resources to assure those things don't go to waste. A shelter can use those items, too, and it's better for poor/homeless people to go there and ask for them than to have them in the streets where they could lose them or have them stolen.\n\nAnother point to make is that you never know if the person you're giving them to is actually mentally stable, and so they might latch on to you for giving them something, not out of malice but because once you show that you have stuff they just want more (and I can't blame them, but I won't risk my wallet or life for it either). Believe me I'm not trying to sound mean but in my country you're better off not interacting with them directly even if it's for a good cause, because many turn out to be like this. ",

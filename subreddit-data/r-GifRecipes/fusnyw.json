When the edges start to cook, flip them over and finish cooking. Extremely simple, but tender and tasty. Almost like a chicken \"steak\" in that I let them brown a little and they have a really nice flavour and texture.\n\nDefinitely can't achieve it with frozen, though.\n\nBut that's also my favorite way to handle thighs, except I don't cut them, just unroll and lay flat, with even less butter (just to barely lube the griddle since thighs have fat), griddle those thighs until they've started to brown on the bottom, flip, and brown the other side. Malliard is such a wonderful thing.\n\nPair it with tasty rice in my rice cooker:\n\n- 2\u2154 cups basmati\n- 4 cups chicken stock\n- 1 stick butter\n- 1 T salt\n- 1 T msg\n\nThat makes rice so delicious it should be criminal.\n\nLast night I turned that into Seattle-style teriyaki - they use grilled thighs, steamed rice, and a bit of teriyaki sauce, and it's delicious. My griddled thighs aren't quite as amazing as grilled, but close enough that it satisfies that itch very well. :) Ahhh, but we're back to talking thighs. lol. yeah, griddled fresh breasts are the only way I enjoy breasts, otherwise I prefer thighs (which are also tastier than breasts when cooked in the same way, but breasts are nice for that \"steak\" effect)",

I'll write down my process as best I can.\n\nIngredients:\n\n1lb pasta (my favorite has been fresh bucatini, but I generally look for fresh if possible and something like a thicker spaghetti or linguine)\n\nBlue cheese\n\nPowdered cayenne pepper\n\nHeavy cream\n\nButter\n\nI melt a couple tablespoons of butter in a pan, add maybe a cup of heavy cream, as that heats up I start slicing off small chunks of blue cheese and melting them in the heating cream. This is very much a \"to taste\" thing, but a couple ounces maybe. Then I add the cayenne a couple shakes at a time, stirring it into the sauce, until it's at a heat level I like. Then boil a pound of pasta until it's nearly done, strain while reserving a bit of the starchy water in a bowl, toss in the sauce, add a little of the water back in, and then boil it out, reducing the sauce and finishing the pasta. Optional topping of shredded parmesan.",

People also make bread in them. They're heavy and retain and distribute heat well so work well both in the oven and on low heat on a stove for long periods of time.\n\nIf you're only starting out with cooking you can start with the Lodge dutch oven. Cheap and will get you familiar with what you can do with it before you upgrade down the line.",

Acidic marinades break down the chicken meat and the moisture then *comes out*. Chicken breast in particular is very susceptible to becoming chalky and mushy from an acidic marinade. Acid should be added to chicken breast after cooking or &lt;15 minutes before cooking. \n\nI\u2019ve seen tandoori and other chicken preps that call for long periods of marinating chicken in acid and these are only demonstrative of people copying other people\u2019s failures out of a desire to be authentic. Just because people may have done this for ages doesn\u2019t make it a good idea. This unfortunate bias might not be offensive with chicken thighs that still have bones and skin, which are more work to break down and contain  more fat, but this technique does not transfer to the large boneless skinless breasts that we breed chicken for these days.",

Marinade the chicken in yogurt and all the other ingredients you see here. Quantities are not very important. \n3. Use coconut milk (full fat, NOT coconut water) instead of cream, or use both for added complexity. Put some yogurt in as well, only a couple spoonfuls. \n4. Some nuts wouldn\u2019t hurt. Blend some cashews with melted butter and add that slurry to the stew.",

You're supposed to mix the spices with yogurt, toss in the chicken and let it sit in the fridge for 4 hours to a day for chicken breast, and a few hours for thighs. \n\nPan frying is solely just cooking the outside, the insides are still raw. The rest is finished up while simmering, which should be closer to 8-10 minutes than 15. \n\nUnless you're someone that simply has no preference for chicken breast, then sure I can understand why you're so against it. But as I said, if done right then the meat will be incredibly tender and juicy.",

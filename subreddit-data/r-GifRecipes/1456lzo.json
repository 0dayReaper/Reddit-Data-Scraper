You'll cut yourself eventually regardless of your hand position because you can't see your fingers behind the blade or guide the blade accurately if you're pulling it back freely at speed. It's a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nYou should probably cut downwards with your fingers crabbed around the potato.",

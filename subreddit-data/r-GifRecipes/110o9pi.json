Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, grease with about 1 tablespoon of olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.\n3. Gently clean the mushrooms with a slightly dampened cloth, then place them on the tray with the smooth side on the bottom.\n4. Season with salt and pepper, then equally distribute the minced garlic, breadcrumbs and, lastly, the grated vegan cheese.\n5. Drizzle with about another tablespoon of olive oil and bake at fan assisted mode for 15 to 20 minutes.\n6. Serve immediately or at room temperature.",

I really want to try this, but I'm worried I'll do it and the chicken will still be slightly raw.  \n\nEdit: Holy shit you guys and gals are fucking amazing. Thank you for all of this. I'm reading every comment and I love the help and different opinions. ",

Frying like this does take talent and practice to get it cooked all the way through and not over crisp or burnt on the outside.  If you have it beautifully golden brown though and it's not 165, throw it in the oven (350 F is fine)for a little bit to get it up to temp.  It might get a tad soggier in the oven after you fried it but that is better than raw chicken. ",

Close oven, turn off. take baby and dog outside. Tie dog up in backyard, take baby over to neighbors house to watch while i figure this out.\n\nCome back into the house the fire had stopped but the house is still filled with smoke. Open all the windows. Toss the lasanga cause the fire/smoke had ruined it.\n\nFew hours later wife comes home, why does it smell smokey? Also... Whats for dinner? \n\nAt least the brown sugar bacon wrapped fried chicken fingers were... good...",

Fill up a glass with ice, preferably smaller cubes or crushed ice, and then fill up with water around that.  Let it sit for a minute or so, then your thermometer should read 32F (0C for you commie cooks).",

You pound your cutlets so they are bigger and thinner, add fillings to one side, and then close them (like a book). Then you put the through the usual flour, egg, and breadcrumbs before frying them (drop a bit of your breadcrumbs into the oil and if it starts frying with little bubbles the oil is ready for your meat). Don't fry at a too hot temperature or you'll just end up with a burnt outside and raw inside.\n\nJust handle it a bit more carefully than a regular fried wiener schnitzel so the cordon bleu doesn't open/fall apart. Once you put it inside the oil while frying the open edge where the two sides of the meat meet should fuse and make further handling easier. I looked up a few videos, you should be able to follow them along (they are in german) but if you need a translation of a bit just ask:    \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwSGTXhdFSA     \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAaRlyJ8TnU     \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL5EKDS2aw8",

A real Cordon Bleu is folded - so you have a thin slice of meat on either side and cheese and ham in the middle. That way the meat will be done much quicker, you are on the save side. Also hands of any kind of \"gravy\" for any food with a breadcrum crust - it makes the crust soggy in no time. Greetings from Schnitzelland.",

If it's too thick it won't cook properly and if it's too thin you run the risk of it becoming dry and tough at the edges. You should be aiming for about 1cm thickness and have the oil up to a level where it is just getting past the middle so it cooks evenly on both sides. Keep the timings for each side the same or just look for that golden brown colour.",

Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder, tossing to coat evenly.\n1. On a cutting board, place a chicken breast between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound until about \u00bd inch (1 cm) thick with a meat mallet, rolling pin, or heavy pan.\n1. Remove the plastic wrap and place a layer of Swiss cheese, then ham, then one more layer of Swiss cheese.\n1. Evenly roll the chicken, and place onto a new sheet of plastic wrap.\n1. Wrap the chicken in the plastic wrap, twist the excess plastic, and roll the chicken while twisting the sides in to tighten and firm up the roll of chicken cordon bleu. Tie the excess and chill in the fridge to set for 30 minutes.\n1. After the rolls are set, prepare large, wide dishes with flour, beaten egg, and bread crumbs.\n1. Dredge the chicken in the flour, egg, and then bread crumbs.\n1. Place the breaded chicken cordon bleu in a 325\u00b0F (170\u00b0C) pot of oil, and cook about 5 minutes per side or until the outside is an even golden brown. If a good color is achieved and the chicken\u2019s center is still not 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C), you can finish the chicken in an oven at 325\u00b0F (170\u00b0C) until that temperature is reached.\n1. In a 1.5-quart saucepan on medium heat, melt the butter and cook the garlic until soft.\n1. Add in flour, and whisk for 1 minute.\n1. Add in the milk, and whisk until fully combined with the roux. Continue whisking until the mixture comes to a simmer and has thickened.\n1. Add in the Dijon mustard, salt, pepper, and Parmesan cheese. Whisk to combine. Set aside.\n1. Slice chicken and serve drizzled with Dijon sauce.\n\n\n[source](https://tasty.co/recipe/crispy-creamy-chicken-cordon-bleu)",

I recently got a meat hammer and have been just pounding all of my breasts so they're even cause when I butterfly them they're still not even. Anyway, I use the plastic wrap method to keep them from tearing but I always season after smashing. I figured if I do it before some will just come off on the wrap. Thoughts?\n\nAlso, brine your chicken. It take 30 minutes of prep I know but if you brine them they are 10x juicier and almost impossible to overcook. Just salt and water in a plastic bag with the chicken for 30 min. Dry completely before moving on to the rest of the recipe. ",

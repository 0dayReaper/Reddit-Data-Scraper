Pages with just basic recipe information wouldn't rank as highly as pages with full sentences including keywords in appropriate contexts. Search engines used to focus on just keywords, regardless of context, and people would cram entire blocks of keywords at the top or bottom of the page so they changed to focus on actual sentences/paragraphs.\n\nI mean that kind of sucks for recipe pages but spiders didn't know the difference between a news article and a recipe, so they just kind of ranked pages with disjointed words lower than ones with full articles, hence story time with grandma Betsy. Unfortunately that became an actual style and it's kind of stuck.\n\nNone of anything I'm saying explains why the hell a video has an autobiography written all over it in such a distracting manner that you don't even notice wtf the actual recipe is. It's not like web spiders utilize text recognition screen readers that actually 'watch' videos.",

I supervised search engine optimization for thousands of clients' websites while working at a multimillion-dollar company. I read insane amounts of articles published by SEO and marketing companies and by search engine companies themselves (Google, bing, yahoo, etc.), and studied and tested different ways to build pages and saw how they ranked. I remember when keyword packing actually achieved good results, and I remember when keyword packing caused sites to drop down in rankings and allowed sites with content including keywords in legitimate context to rise in rankings. A page with employee bio's would rank higher than the \"about\" page for the office itself because it had more content and more appropriate keywords in appropriate context. That's just how it worked.\n\nSo yea, like I said, a page with only a stripped down recipe wouldn't rank as highly as a page with a story. That, and the more incoming links from other sites, the more legit the page would seem to spiders and even though we here would prefer a justtherecipe, plenty of folks like the stories so the bigger, longer, and uncut pages being linked by more sentimental types also ranked higher. Then, like I said, it became the thing to do and people that followed did it too and it is unfortunately still pretty typical to see those storytime with Grandma Edna recipe pages. More unfortunately, the folks following in those footsteps think it's just the thing to do but don't seem to know why it started to be a thing in the first place so adding a bs story onto a video could seem totally okay but doesn't actually do anything but cause a thousand redditors to make fun of a really dumbass move.",

For adding just a little juice while cooking, the method I mentioned is better.\n\nEdit: \"boob juicer\" is what I've called them since I was a kid and I still find it funny, but it does differentiate them from juicing machines that grind up everything and you have to dispose of a whole container of peel/pulp\n\nAlso, if you want the flavor but not a lot of extra liquid, using a [zester](https://www.amazon.com/Citrus-Zester-Cheese-Grater-AdeptChef/dp/B01IJHU7YO/ref=asc_df_B01IJHU7YO?linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=80470559437083) to scrape the outside of the peel (as long as you don't scrape down to the bitter white \"pith\" under the skin) will give a lot of flavor without extra liquid. It's one method for adding orange/lemon to things like foams or cakes or cookies without messing with the proper cooking ratio (it adds a tiny bit of citrus oil but not enough to mess with even a delicate recipe.\n\nAt this point I'm just rambling but hey, take your newfound knowledge, go forth, and conquer!",

Cut the lemon in half, place it pulp side towards the holes. Squeeze out what you can. Then take that half, place it sideways in the squeezer and give it one last mash. Repeat with other half or lemon.\n\nYou can get basically all the juice out of a lemon. It\u2019s way more than you will get by hand. Way less messy, too.",

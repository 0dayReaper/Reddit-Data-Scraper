I do not have an exact recipe, but I will detail my process. \n\nThe first step is to make a tomato broth, which I do by using tomato sauce, a little tomato paste, salt, and then enough water to make it brothy. Simmer it gently and taste it for seasoning. This is going to be the only thing really salting the pasta, so make sure it is well seasoned.\n\nYou will need the widest pan you have to cook the pasta. I would not use a nonstick pan. Traditionally, the dish uses spaghetti I think, but any long pasta will work. I tend to use the cheap stuff for for this. I tend to buy bronze die extruded pasta when I can get it, but for al'assassina, the cheaper, Teflon extruded stuff works. Where I live, this is typically just the generic brand or the brand Barilla. Build a base of olive oil, some of the broth, some garlic, and some chili. Heat it relatively gently, usually medium low on my cooktop. The pasta will go into the pan UNCOOKED in as even a layer as possible. It is okay if the pasta is kind of in a pile. \n\nThis is how the pasta will cook. Let it absorb the broth, then fry in the oil. It should stick to the pan a little. Let the pasta itself brown. Some people even like a little char on the pasta. Being patient is very important here, you want to develop good browning. When it has browned some, add some more broth and turn the pile of pasta over to brown another part of it. Be mindful of your heat so the garlic and chili do not burn. If you run out of broth, you can either quickly make some more or just finish with water. \n\nThe pasta is done when it is sufficiently browned (traditionally, it should be pretty dark, some people even like some char as I said) and the pasta is pliable but not too soft. It should be easy to bite into a chew, but still have some crunch to it. \n\nThe flavor of the dish comes from the broth being absorbed by the pasta, the browning of the pasta itself, and the remains of the oil infused with garlic, chili, and the tomato.",

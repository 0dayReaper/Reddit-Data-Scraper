I like to arrange a few fresh pieces of arugula on the bottom of the pasta plate and drizzle them with a touch of extra virgin olive oil. I pile the cooked pasta straight on top. This will bring in a more intense peppery flavor with a little bit of the fresh green crunchiness you lose from cooking the arugula. This method works best with arugula, in my opinion. So if you decide to make this recipe with greens like spinach, escarole, or lacinato kale, simply cook all of your greens in the sauce instead of reserving a few fresh greens for serving.\n\n**Creamy Lemon-Arugula Pasta with Sausage:**\n\n* 1 teaspoon olive oil, plus more if needed\n* 1 pound hot Italian sausage, casings removed\n* 2 shallots, peeled and diced\n* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* 1 tablespoon of butter, optional\n* 1 cup white wine\n* 1 cup water\n* 16 ounces bucatini; 1 cup pasta cooking water reserved\n* \u00bc cup fresh lemon juice\n* \u00be cup heavy cream\n* 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard\n* \u00bd cup finely grated parmesan, plus more for serving\n* 3 ounces arugula, plus a few pinches for serving\n* 2 tablespoons freshly minced parsley, plus more for serving\n* Extra virgin olive oil, for serving\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Boil the pasta water:**\n\n1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. As you wait for the water to boil, begin the sauce.\n\n**Brown the sausage:**\n\n1. Heat the olive oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, for 15\u201320 minutes or until it\u2019s very well-browned. Transfer to a bowl.\n\n**Cook the aromatics:**\n\n1. Add another teaspoon of olive oil to the pot, if needed, and turn the heat to medium. Add the shallot and cook for 5 minutes until it just begins to soften. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n2. Melt the butter into the garlic, if using. Return the sausage to the pot and toss to coat. Return the heat to medium-high. As soon as the sausage begins to sizzle, pour in the white wine and bring it to a boil. Boil for 3-5 minutes.\n\n**Simmer the sauce:**\n\n1. Add the water to the pot and return to a boil. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat and simmer for 20\u201325 minutes until reduced by at least half.\n\n**Boil the pasta:**\n\n1. Add a generous amount of salt to the boiling water along with the pasta. Cook until al dente. Remove 1 cup of pasta water from the pot and drain the pasta. Set aside.\n\n**Finish the sauce:**\n\n1. Add half the pasta cooking water, the lemon juice, and the cream to the sauce. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to medium. Stir in the Dijon mustard. Rapid simmer for 5\u20137 minutes until it begins to thicken. Once thickened, reduce heat to low.\n2. Sprinkle the grated parmesan over the sauce and whisk vigorously until completely combined. Taste and season to your preferences.\n3. Add the arugula, fresh parsley, and pasta to the sauce. Toss to coat until the pasta is warmed through and the arugula is just wilted. Add more of the pasta cooking water, as needed, to loosen up the sauce. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Place a few pinches of fresh arugula on each plate and drizzle them with just a touch of extra virgin olive oil. Pile the cooked pasta on top and finish with more parsley and grated parmesan, if you like. Enjoy!",

The only downside is it does have a little trans fat, so if going that route I would only use 1/2 cup. \n\nIf you want to use milk, I\u2019d actually recommend making a roux before adding the pasta water and lemon juice. Add a little butter, sprinkle 1-2 tbsp flour over the sausage and then add lemon juice. Then, slowly whisk 3/4 cup whole milk. You likely won\u2019t need all the pasta water, so just whisk in as needed to thin out the sauce to your preferences. Finish by whisking in the cheese. \n\nMain thing is to just keep heat very low so you don\u2019t break the milk.",

If I can\u2019t find that I\u2019ll use lactose free milk and the roux method you described. \n\nIs the amount of cheese integral to the structure of the sauce? Parmesan affects me less than other cheeses so I can usually get away with just taking a bunch of lactaid and saying a prayer, but I will probably have to reduce the amount just a bit to survive eating this lol",

Violife I think? The texture is very similar so you could try that instead! Just make sure you buy the block and grate it yourself. Pre-grated cheese\u2014vegan or not \u2014 will have cellulose coating and won\u2019t melt well in the sauce.",

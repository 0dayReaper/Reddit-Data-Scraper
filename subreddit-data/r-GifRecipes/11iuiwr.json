Most northern central states outright ban beef production and consumption or even possession and it can lead to criminal charges. Some states allow cow slaughter if they  are given a 'fit for slaughter' certificate - but eating beef publicly in these states might still get you heat from authorities and religious groups. And some just don't have any ban, and people there regularly consume beef, mostly states in east, north east, some southern states.",

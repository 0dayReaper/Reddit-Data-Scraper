In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. Whisk to sift and aerate mixture.\n2. To the centre of the bowl filled with your dry mixture, add oil, vanilla, and eggs. Use whisk to mash eggs prior to combining all ingredients together. Mixture will be thick. Add chopped walnuts and shredded carrots, folding with spatula until mixture is evenly incorporated. Mixture will appear wet and speckled with shredded carrot.\n3. Half-fill 12 lined muffin holders. Add ~1 tbsp of cream cheese mixture to each muffin. Top with remaining muffin batter. Sprinkle with additional walnuts to top.\n4. Bake carrot cake muffins at 350F for ~45 min (40-48 min) or until a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean or with a few crumbs attached. Let cool for 10 min in muffin tin prior to allowing to cool completely on wire cooling rack.\n5. Enjoy!",

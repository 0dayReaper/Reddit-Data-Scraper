There's a difference between cheese(sauce) that has \"shifted\" due to too much heat and what you see here, which is the exact opposite in my opinion, being solid cheese that hasn't had enough heat to melt.\n\nWhat generally happens when you add too much heat is not the cheese becoming clumpy but egg solidifying, since there's no egg involved to overcook and \"shift\" the sauce to produce what you describe, that's probably not the issue. What you see here is cheese that has not melted fully, he turned the heat off before adding it, but it actually takes a bit of heat to combine all those elements into a sauce of decent consistency, even with the pasta water.\n\nWith all the cuts it's difficult to tell, but you'll notice that it never has the right consistency, if what you described was true, it would go through all three stages (unmelted cheese &gt; good &gt; solidified).\n\nI'm no chef, but I do these kinds of recipes multiple times each week, and you can usually tell the difference as well, solidified is unsolvable, unmelted is just a starting point that needs more heat, the former produces more coarse bits, while the latter tends to produce the more rounded bits, you can even see some strands of cheese that still look almost fresh out of the grater when he pours it on the plate.",

Because the propellants used to get oil out of a can of Pam are the same fuels used in a kitchen torch \u2014 butane and propane.\n\nI\u2019ve never had any creme brulee where I ever tasted butane or propane but it\u2019s technically possible. If the temp isn\u2019t hot enough so the torch is not really burning the fuel, you might taste it. Kind of like if you put a hot dog on a gas grill and turned the propane tank on but didn\u2019t light it or get enough of a flame \u2014 same premise. Also possible if you burn the living shit out of it with too close a flame.\n\n[found a source that agrees](https://www.scienceofcooking.com/blow-torch-cooking.htm)",

                    "comment": "There is an even easier way to make it, if you have a food thermometer and/or enough experience. With this technique you don't even need an oven or a water bath (extracting the ramekins from the water bath can be a real pain in the butt).\n\nInstructions:  \nJust put all the ingredients into a pot and stir until well combined. Turn up the heat to medium-ish and start stirring. The lower the heat the safer the process will be but it'll also take longer. Keep it on the heat while continuously stirring vigorously until the mixture reaches around 82-84\u00b0C or 180-183\u00b0F (depends on your ingredients and the thermometer) and immediately strain it through a fine-mesh sieve. Fill into ramekins, cover with cling film and put them in the fridge overnight.\n\n\nTroubleshooting:  \nIf you have a lot of foam on your custard like in OPs video, you can pop the bubbles quickly with your blowtorch (don't need to turn it up high for this) for an even surface.    \nIf you have lots of lumps in your sieve or your custard after straining you let the mixture get too hot.    \nIf the custard is grainy, you can sorta save it by thoroughly blending the custard with an immersion blender, but it probably won't set well in the fridge so you'll end up with slightly weird custard rather than cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.   \nIf the custard won't set in the fridge you didn't cook it hot enough, didn't use enough eggs or both.  \nIf the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e tastes too eggy, you can try replacing two/three egg yolks with one whole egg next time. Ideally you wanna go by weight rather than just counting the eggs/yolks.\n\nEdit: Whichever method you use, you really should practice it once or twice before making it for Christmas and don't forget the vanilla! :D",

Preheat oven to 325F (300F convection bake). Place 4 ramekins into a ~2\" deep baking/casserole dish. Set aside.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until creamy.\n2. Meanwhile, heat heavy cream until boiling (Note: this can be done in a saucepan or in 30s increments in the microwave). Once boiling, stir in vanilla and salt.\n3. Slowly add cream mixture to egg yolk/sugar mixture (I recommend adding no more than 1/2 cup of cream mixture at a time and whisking vigorously so as to not curdle the eggs).\n4. Evenly distribute cream mixture into 4 ramekins (Note: You can also distribute mixture into 5 ramekins if this works best for your ramekin shape).\n5. Fill your baking/casserole dish with boiling hot water so that it covers the base and ~1\" of the height of each ramekin.\n6. Bake at 325F for ~35-45min or until the sides of each cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e are set and the centre is slightly wobbly (Note: after 35 minutes, I recommend checking cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e every 5 minutes until done). Remove ramekins from the oven and allow to cool completely at room temperature.\n7. Once cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e's have cooled to room temperature, cover in plastic wrap and chill for 1h to overnight.\n8. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e by Kitchen Torch: Unwrap each cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Add 1-2 tsp of granulated sugar to the top of each, gently rotating to evenly distribute sugar. Using a kitchen torch, heat the tops of each until golden brown/caramelized.\n9. Br\u00fbl\u00e9e by Oven: Unwrap each cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Add 1-2 tsp of granulated sugar to the top of each, gently rotating to evenly distribute sugar. Set Oven to broil. Place ramekins in the oven for 30s at a time until caramelized (Note: 10. Do not step away from your oven!! Your cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e can quickly burn if left unattended).\n11. Enjoy!",

Maybe a salamander (extremely hot broiler made for searing steaks and such)? But that's not necessarily common in domestic kitchens. \n\nAnd to piggyback on your comment about torching: It's okay, but a little bit dangerous, to pick up the dish and spin/move it around in your hand as you torch the top. This helps move the melted sugar around, exposing all of the granules to the flame so they too can melt. You're also helping create a more even crust and preventing burning in the process. Obviously, BE VERY CAREFUL AND AWARE OF WHERE THE FLAME IS IN RELATION TO YOUR FINGERS.",

I've been making creme brulee for years on special occasions, and I've landed in [Alton Brown's recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/creme-brulee-recipe-1916827) giving the best result, which is basically what you have here.\n\nOnly difference is infusing fresh vanilla, which, once you try it you won't go back to extract.  This is one of the few instances where fresh vanilla makes a *huge* difference in the end flavor.  Maybe it's because the dish is so simple, something small like that amps it up to 11.\n\nOnly thing I add to Alton's recipe is to use cheesecloth to strain the cream after infusion so there aren't bits of vanilla at the bottom of the end product.  Also, I don't bother with vanilla sugar for the top, I find that flavor doesn't carry over at all so regular sugar works fine.\n\nNext to tiramisu, probably my favorite dessert dish, thanks for sharing!",

I had the same question when I came to the comment section.  \n  \nNot for you, but for anybody else reading this comment, the reason you need to heat the milk is to create a custard out of the egg yolks. Custard is effectively a semi-cooked egg. By stirring it during the process you prevent chunky coagulation of the egg. In response to the previous comment, you want the heavy cream to be below boiling to avoid a grainy texture to the custard.  \n  \nMy sister is vegan, so I've had to figure out how to adapt cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. If the person doesn't mind a banana flavor, ~~over~~ under ripe bananas are a super easy replacement for eggs -- almost universally. I tried to research it, and I have no idea how it does this. Pectin? No idea. You could also use just about any other thickening agent, and cornstarch is a common option as well. Once you get into the atypical starches and polysaccharides, there are a ton of options there as well (tapioca, potato, arrowroot, guar gum, xantham gum, etc)  \n  \nEdit:  Turns out bananas have multiple polysaccharides, including pectin, lectin, and hemi cellulose. Also, I've been doing it wrong. You should use unripe bananas as a thickener. It has a ton more starch in it.",

In the case of making a custard, you need starch. If you break down all the starches into basic sugars, it wouldn't thicken or congeal.  \n  \nFor example, you can use amylase to make moonshine/hooch/booze. Start with something super starchy, like mashed potatoes, add your favorite source of amylase (it comes in a packet), slightly heat the mixture with water for a while. Boom, you turned starch into sugar. Now, as every culture in the world has independently discovered, you add yeast, wait several weeks, capture all the boiled steam, and you have higher proof alcohol.",

Also if you want a more even crust hold the brulee  and tilt it while you melt the sugar. Just be careful not to torch your hand. I've also found success ( In larger batches) with adding a few drops of water to a bowl of sugar before I spread it on the brulee and torch. Seems to help it melt and spread instead of fly all over with the pressure from the torch",

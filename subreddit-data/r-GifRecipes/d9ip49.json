They come in an enormous number of styles and are commonplace in Britain but almost no one in the U.S. has. In \"Gulliver's Travels\", Jonathan Swift satirized the fundamental absurdity of politics and religion by having the Kingdom of Lilliput split into two rival factions based on whether soft boiled eggs should be cracked open on the \"big-end\" or the \"little-end\".",

The argument spawned the war between them but it had been so long since that argument took place that they had forgotten entirely that's how the war started.  It was a satire of the war between England and France and how no one could remember how that started.\n\nI did a whole research paper and 10 minute presentation in University on Gulliver's travels earlier this year lol.

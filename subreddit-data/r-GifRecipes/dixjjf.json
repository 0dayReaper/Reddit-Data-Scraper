Uses one decent oven tray and doesn't need any fancy equipment.\n\nBut mostly it's a great base on which to experiment with flavor combinations.  Different root veggies, lamb, chicken, or game meat snags.  \n\nChili, and other spices would also work well.\n\nPlus, make in bulk and it'll store well as leftovers. \n\nNicely done.",

Fancy sausages just do not have the same quality you want in a proper sausage sizzle. \n\nAnd I'm going to go against everything we stand for, but I think onions are better on the bottom, under the sausage.",

An ingredient list that includes mostly stuff you already have on hand (I have the veggies pretty regularly but would have to pick up the meat, but I imagine this would work well with just about any meat. Chicken, beef, whatever you have available), doesn't require elaborate cooking methods (most complicated thing is to remember to turn the sausages after 25min), and the best part: only two dishes. It's even done within an hour. Perfect for making the night before, coming home from work and just popping it in the oven while you relax for an hour then bam, dinner is ready.",

Toss well to coat.**\n* **Add sausages and toss briefly.** \n* **Transfer into roasting pan. Pan should be of a size so the vegetables are stacked about 2 deep - see photos and video. Rearrange sausages so they are on top.**\n\nGRAVY\n\n* **In the same bowl used for the vegetables, add butter and flour. Whisk.**\n* **Add a bit of beef broth and whisk, then whisk in remaining broth. (Don't worry if you end up with some floating butter bits)**\n* **Pour down the side of the pan (don't pour over the sausages or veggies).**\n* **Optional: Spray sausages with oil - browns slightly better (especially lean sausages).**\n\nBAKING\n\n* **Bake 25 minutes. Turn sausages. Spray again with oil (optional) then bake for a further 25 minutes or until sausages are browned and potatoes are soft.**\n* **Serve Sausages and Vegetables with Gravy on top, garnished with fresh thyme leaves if desired. (See notes for Gravy thickness adjustment)**\n\nRecipe Notes:\n\n**1. Potatoes:** **I used potatoes about the size of a golf ball. If yours are much larger, halve them. You can also use large potatoes and cut them.**\n\n**2. Sausages:** **Use any sausage of choice here, I use thick pork ones.**\n\n**3. Broth:** **The original recipe was made using chicken broth (liquid stock). I have changed this to beef broth because I think it makes a deeper flavoured gravy and also makes the gravy colour more brown. But it works really well with chicken too, it is just that the colour will be paler.**\n\n**4. Gravy Thickness:** **The gravy thickness will be affected by things like how juicy your sausages and vegetables are, the strength of the oven, heat retention of your pan etc. If too thin (note that gravy will thicken slightly as you start removing sausages etc from pan), remove sausages and vegetables then return pan to the oven for a few minutes - it should reduce fairly quickly because of the large surface area.If too thick, just add a splash of hot water - a bit at a time!**",

If you're looking for a cheaper option, you could probably replace the sausage with chicken breasts and the beef broth with chicken broth. You could get a family pack of breasts that would have enough chicken for a few runs of this no problem. The vegetable costs compared to the meat is pretty negligible, imo. Potatoes, carrots, garlic, and onions are pretty cheap and come in bags where you could make a few runs without having to buy more. You could probably get this down to about 6-7 bucks per batch and it looks like it could easily feed two for a couple days.",

Sausages tend to have a pretty heavy amount of flavours/spices in them as well as being quite fatty and chicken breast has no additional spices and is extremely lean. If you tried to put some chicken breasts in the oven like this for 50 minutes at 390 you would absolutely overcook them to hell and back and back to hell and back.\n\nAs a side note where do you live that chicken breasts are cheaper than sausages by weight? I'm in Canada and chicken breasts are around double the price of sausages here so hearing about using them as a budget option was kinda surprising.",

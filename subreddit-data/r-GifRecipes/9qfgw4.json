For fruit based cakes where you want a cleaner flavor, oil is better. (Also butter has about 10-20% water content, and that\u2019s going to affect your cakes as well).\n\n2. Some cakes like devil\u2019s food or chiffon don\u2019t require or want creaming for textural or flavor reasons. And obviously, oil based cakes don\u2019t need creaming.\n\n3. Olive oil cake is delicious, but I would not recommend replacing all the oil with butter.",

But I just googled it for kicks and here\u2019s what I found:\n\n&gt;\tMost baked goods use flour, egg, leavening, sugar, milk, salt and a fat. Lighter baked foods use a liquid fat, almost always vegetable oil, rather than a solid fat such as butter or shortening. The purpose of the fat is to coat the protein, in this case the flour, in order to keep it from mixing with the other liquids. If the flour can\u2019t mix it can\u2019t form gluten, which would make the cake chewy. The result is that vegetable oil makes baked goods lighter and moister.\n\nI think we can all agree flavorwise you can\u2019t beat butter. But could veg oil lead to better texture? We need some more sources up in here. Now I need to know.",

It's also pretty easy to test for yourself with a box mix recipe, just split it in half and add oil to one and butter to another. (Recommending box mix since it's cheap for the purpose of this experiment.)\n\nFlavorwise is a toss up too, adding butter isn't always a good thing if you're trying to make a cleaner, purer flavor profile, like fruit cakes or some kinds of chocolate cake.",

It's directly appalling.  \nReddit is a place where the value lies in the content provided by the users and the free work provided by the moderators. Taking away the best ways of sharing this content and removing the tools the moderators use to better help make Reddit a safe place for everyone is extremely short sighted.  \nTherefore, I have chosen to remove all of my content from this site, replacing it with this text to (at least slightly) lower the value of this place, which I no longer believe respects their users and contributors.  \nYou can do the same.

So while modern American democracy is somewhere in the middle of a democratic freedom index, the context of most American attitudes often develops contrasting it against very much less free types of government. It helps that our founding documents, and much of our early literature focuses heavily on the inherent moral good of democracy, even if those documents didn't have nearly as much freedom as we enjoy today. Most common core k-12 history classes focus on this message, and as a result it always gets very good results as political tag lines. Politicians won't stop saying it and it continues to help color Americans views well into adulthood. ",

Aspergillus mold eats sugar and leaves citric acid after consumption and although it's strained from the final product, I imagine mold-sensitive people can still react from it.\nThe proteins in citrus fruits are so similar to grasses that people get an immune response from citrus. Also, citrus seeds have similar proteins to peanuts, so many who have anaphylaxis to peanuts or tree nuts (cashews, almonds, etc) will often have similar reactions with citrus or stone fruits. Pretty much all allergies and sensitivities are caused by proteins. \n\nSimilar to citrus, pineapple has proteins that are very similar to grasses and bananas.  So people with latex, banana, or grass allergies will have reactions with pineapple.",

It's a traditional American southern cake that contains banana, pineapple, and pecans. It was first published under that name in the 1970s but there are other, earlier versions that have similar ingredients. But there is no clear, definitive evidence on how it came to be called hummingbird cake. There are theories, though, such as a similar cake was first made in Jamaica and named \"Doctor Bird\" cake, after the hummingbird (called the doctor bird, also Jamaica's national bird). Another theory is simply that it's just so damn sweet and tasty that hummingbirds would love it. There's also the interesting point that a similar banana cake made earlier in 1900s was called \"Bird of Paradise Cake.\" ",

While I normally make mine with pork (I just get a cheap cubed cut and dice it), beyond is a very easy swap out. Very nice OP.\n\nMy method of mapo includes eggplant as well to include some veg (add when the meat is halfway to being cooked), and I use sake mixed with the dobanjang instead of veg stock (this thickens the sauce a bit more - I also use about a TB of cornstarch for my slurry). Mine is clearly a more Japanese influenced take than the OP, but it's a pretty easy recipe to tweak to preference.",

In my opinion, the dish does require a meat (even if it is something like beyond/impossible) to stay true to the original core flavor profile.",

A lot of of Chinese/Asian dishes are mostly vegetables and a small amount of meat, including this one. The ratio of tofu-to-meat has always been more tofu, less meat. It's called Mapo **Tofu** for a reason. It's not a meat dish, it's a tofu dish. You can absolutely leave out the meat with no substitute and still call it the same dish. Lots of restaurants already do.\n\nLike I said, once you add in the eggplant, it's no longer \"traditional\" anyway. I strongly suggest *trying* it without the meat to see what changes instead of being dismissive about it. The most common vegetarian version uses chopped mushrooms to replicate the texture, which in my opinion is the main purpose of the meat.",

It is an entirely different ingredient that can be used in many places without being a meat substitute (and often in Asian dishes, alongside meat). I didn't say that just tofu is not a good idea.\n\nI only challenged your use of language (tofu is the star). Of course you wouldn't use a half and half of tofu to meat. Meat has a strong flavor that carries a lot further than an equivalent amount of tofu. I'm not saying that meat is the central component, or that tofu isn't a central component. I'm saying both are for the originating dish.\n\nYou also seem to target my use of eggplant as a way of attack my use of \"traditional\".  I did state my version is Japanese influenced - the Japanese dish mabo nasu is what influences my mapo, which does also utilize meat (also my use of sake vs shaoxing wine).\n\nI'm sure that you may believe that the mushroom replaces the primary purpose (texture) and while I'm sure that it does do that (I make vegetarian pasta frequently, and do use mushroom in it), meat does add a flavor that cannot replicated by plain vegetables - hence this version in the OP which uses beyond. Would I eat a non-meat version? Absolutely. Would I make it? Probably not, due to what I'm looking for in terms of flavor when I make mapo (although I would make an impossible/beyond version).",

I actually agree. I *know* tofu is not a meat substitute. I grew up with it, it's a part of my cultural upbringing.\n\nI was just saying this dish doesn't necessary need to have meat. While the meat adds flavor, it's still a tofu dish at the end of the day. I don't believe the tofu and the meat share an equal role. \n\nI love tofu and my frustration comes from people treating it like a meat substitute or that it's not the star of its own dish. The tofu is the central component, the meat isn't. Mapo Tofu is still recognizable without the meat, but if you leave out the tofu, it becomes a different dish (such as the Mapo eggplant in your case). I'm annoyed that you seem to think this is subject of debate when to me it is clearly not.",

Tips for others, so you don't make the same mistakes:\n\n\nSilken tofu is super soft and is apparently often used as a replacement for cream. Ours fell completely apart and it was not possible to make nice squares, even after drying. It had the consistency of a jelly pudding. \"Soft\" and \"silken\" mean different things for different brands, probably.\n\n\nWe also used a carbon steel wok on the designated wok burner on our stove, but even on the lowest gas setting the fluids evaporated way too fast. We didn't really end up with a sauce. Maybe it would be easier to just use a frying pan on a normal stove burner (?)\n\n\nSo the end result was more a mushy scramble and not at all like the video. It tasted great, though!",

Don't know about where you live how this is made, but in Japan we use \u6728 tofu, not \u4e1d. \"Silken doufu\" (called that by the method to strain the water, not the actual texture) is used for soup.\n\n&gt; doesn't usually/traditionally contain miso, because it's a Sichuan dish, not a Japanese dish\n\n\u9ebb\u8fa3\u8c46\u8150 =  mala **dou**fu. Thought to be a sichuan dish but it's eaten all over China and dofu is a considered a North Eastern food. But that being said, I've had this in China using red spicy miso.\n\n\u9ebb\u5a46\u8c46\u8150 = mapo **to**fu. Is what Japanese people prefer to eat. Made with miso. The title says TOFU.\n\n&gt; doesn't usually/traditionally contain star anise\n\nOK. You are right about this and I'm wrong. I'll give you this.\n\n&gt; mapo tofu means \"pockmarked grandmother's tofu\"\n\nOK. But I never had this in China in 13 years, including when I staying in Sichuan. I never heard anyone say \"mapodoufu\" (let alone mapotofu). If I say that in a restaurant, people would say \"Oh maladoufu\".",

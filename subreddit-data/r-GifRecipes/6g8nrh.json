This included watermelon.\n\nThey preferred alcoholic drinks to watermelon, so they cut one end of the watermelon open, cored a tube of it out, packed the hole thus made with sugar, and taped the end \"cap\" back on.\n\nThen they hid the whole thing in a large fire extinguisher, small barrel or similar hiding spot for a week or two.\n\nIt would naturally ferment inside, resulting in a chunky alcoholic food/drink.\n\nOf course, they had a Sergeant (or equivalent) who was really, really good at sniffing the things out and who would invariably show up to roll call the next day hung over....\n",

It is made at home by acquiring codeine, sold over the counter for headaches, and cooking it with paint thinner, gasoline, hydrochloric acid, iodine and the red phosphorous from matchbox strike pads. The resulting liquid is injected into a vein. The high from this drug lasts 90 minutes to two hours, and it takes about a half-hour to make the drug. \n\n\n&gt;When a heroin addict can no longer afford that drug, he can make up krokodil which has a stronger kick and costs about a tenth the price. But while the life expectancy of a Moscow heroin addict is four to seven years, the life expectancy of a krokodil addict is just a year or two.\n\n\n&gt;Krokodil gets its name from the fact that the caustic drug causes an addict\u2019s skin to become green, scaly and bumpy like a crocodile\u2019s. If the drug misses a vein and is injected into flesh, that flesh will develop abscesses. It is common for addicts to develop gangrene and require amputations. The flesh on some body parts affected by krokodil injections will rot off completely, leaving bare bone.",

The idea was that when you sliced the watermelon and got a piece, it would be delicious watermelon infused with alcohol.\n\nKing's cup was played. I did not participate. My husband ended up losing. The \"penalty\" was to drink a cup of the watermelon juice. In theory it was supposed to be mostly watermelon juice with some vodka, but in reality it was just a cup of pink vodka. For some dumb reason he finished the cup.\n\nHusband got wasted and kept trying to hug people. We were in the pool. His drunk ass couldn't swim well so he just hobbled around slowly trying to hug his wary victims. It turned into a messed up game of Marco-Polo. Then he threw up later. Party host later apologized for \"getting my husband trashed on watermelon\". We joke about it now.\n\nSo yeah, that's my watermelon alcohol story. Please enjoy.",

Cut a thin slice from the bottom of the watermelon rind (but not into the flesh) so the watermelon will sit upright. With a sharp knife, carve out a circle in the top of the watermelon to make a lid, as you would when carving a jack-o'-lantern.\n\n2. To prepare with an immersion blender: Set the watermelon in the sink (to avoid splashes). Remove the lid and insert an immersion blender into the flesh. Gently push and move the immersion blender down and around in the watermelon to puree the center. As more of the watermelon becomes pureed, move the blender to the sides to puree almost all of the flesh, leaving a thin wall of flesh lining the rind. Pour the pureed juice out of the watermelon; you should have between 6 and 7 cups.\n\n3. To prepare with a drill: Fasten one beater from an electric hand mixer to the tip of a drill and tighten the chuck. Set the watermelon in the sink (to avoid splashes) and push the beater into the flesh. Gently push and move the beater down and around in the watermelon to puree the center. As more of the watermelon becomes pureed, move the beater to the sides to puree almost all of the flesh, leaving a thin wall of flesh lining the rind. Pour the pureed juice out of the watermelon, and strain, discarding any pulp and seeds; you should have between 6 and 7 cups of strained juice.\n\n4. Insert a tap in the empty watermelon according to the package directions. Pour the watermelon juice, wine and vodka into the watermelon and top with the lid. Refrigerate until the watermelon and punch inside are well chilled, at least 2 hours.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCopyright 2017 Television Food Network, G.P.

Take the bladder and tap apart and clean them\n5. Put the bladder into the pumpkin (or watermelon) and fill it back up with something delicious. \n6. Re-attach the tap on the outside to the bladder\n7. Drink \n\nFrankly it's a lot of \"to do\" but not exactly difficult or confusing. And people get a kick out of it.",

Then I used a steel brush to scrub off what was left.\n\nHowever, I have to say that the pan in the video is rarely used. That is why it is the way it is. But to reduce the risk of getting oil all stuck on the pan, the best you can do is just not go too crazy with the flame, and don't leave the pan, especially with oil, unattended, its dangerous too.",

It is has general connotations that the person is posting something controversial to incite emotions or to garner comments from people. This can from many such contexts such as ignorance, trolling, or in this case experimentation with a classic dish. For context there is a group of people on the internet that believe in culinary puritanism as well as avoiding culinary appropriation. That is that a food item can only be one (or one of several close variants) recipe and that any changes to the recipe have negative consequences. Also that a dish can only be changed by people from the nation or geographic region that the dish appeared first in. This group speaks out even when people, like the OP, mark out where their version of the dish deviates. This can also extend to when people do not name the dish the traditional name or cook something that is similar to the traditional dish.",

Place the basil, edamame, tahini, hemp hearts, nutritional yeast, lemon juice and zest, garlic and salt into a mini food processor or blender cup.\n    \n2.  Pour in the ice water and blend. Scrape down the sides as needed and continue to blend until mixture is uniform in consistency and mostly smooth. Refrigerate mixture until ready to use.\n    \n3.  Toast your bread as desired. Cut a garlic clove in half and use the cut side of the garlic to rub on to the surface of the toast. Add a generous smear of the edamame mixture on top then top as desired. I chose cucumber slices and topped with some pickled onions, chili oil and some flakey salt and pepper.\n    \n\n[Source](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrMF-oyJmJE/)",

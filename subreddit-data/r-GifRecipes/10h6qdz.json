That's why it looks like the spaghetti is swimming in sauce. I sauced the rest afterward. Might try my hand at fried spaghetti for the leftovers!!\n\n* 1 tablespoon olive oil\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 3 tablespoons butter\n* 8 ounces mushrooms, trimmed, wiped clean, and sliced\n* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* Crushed red pepper to taste\n* 1/4 cup wine, sweet vermouth, vegetable stock, or water\n* 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes\n* Pinch of sugar to taste\n* 16 ounces spaghetti\n* 1/2 cup ricotta cheese\n* 3 ounces spinach\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* For serving:\n* Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano\n* Fresh basil leaves\n* Freshly ground black pepper\n\n**Start the sauce:**\n\n1. Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the onion and saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes.\n2. Melt the butter into the pot. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring often for 8\u201310 minutes until they begin to deepen in color and develop a golden-brown crust around the edges. Season with salt and pepper.\n3. Stir the minced garlic and crushed red pepper in the mushrooms. Cook for 1 minute.\n\n**Simmer the sauce:**\n\n1. Pour in the water, wine, or stock and lift up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Pour in the tomatoes. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and a generous pinch of sugar if you like. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes.\n\n**Cook the pasta:**\n\n1. As the sauce cooks, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and spaghetti. Cook until al dente. Scoop out 1/2 cup of the water and set aside. Drain the pasta.\n\n**Finish the sauce:**\n\n1. Stir the ricotta and spinach into the tomato sauce. As soon as the spinach begins to wilt, add the pasta and toss to coat. Add the pasta water as needed to loosen up the sauce so that it coats the pasta evenly. Taste and season once more.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the cooked pasta between shallow bowls. Garnish with parmesan cheese, fresh basil, and black pepper. Enjoy!",

My Dad was the great cook... my mom did...well. literally everything else. Ha. Thx Mom. Still the number 1 parent imho.\n\nBut anyway..... where they both shone was cooking up spaghetti with Italian sausage. I.S. always makes me think of growing up and home.\n\nSpaghetti was my favorite meal as a kid.\nTill I discovered the magic of tacos.\nBut both still deliver plenty of nostalgia...\n\nI've had a few beers.\nMy point is that this is making me super hungry and I deff will try Italian sausage meatballs. \n\nAs I'm gonna try mixing beef and pork, maybe I'll try beef/Italian sausage in a 1:1 as it's usually pork from what I know. \n\n*MANGIA!!!*",

I've nothing against variations on a theme. I love jazz.\n\nOnce you change the name of the recipe, anything goes. I don't know anybody here in Italy that would make a fuss about it.\nFor example, it is quite common here in Italy to have \"carbonara di mare\" (seafood carbonara) on the menu of seafood restaurants, and nobody here gets mad about that.\n\nNote that I (we) still do care about using meaningful names.\n\nFor example, if I go to a restaurant in the city I was born (70Km from Bologna) and from the menu I order  \"tagliatelle alla bolognese\" I would be a little pissed off if they bring me something that contains *spurious unexpected ingredients*, like peas or parsley or basil or oregano or garlic. (But not to the point of  making a scene: there are worst things in life than a butchered bolognese...)",

Italy has variations, sometimes huge variations, on various dishes depending on what region you're in. Not only that, if you think every family makes them the same you're insane. \n\nThe only people that give a shit about it to the extent of being \"insulted\" are terminally online weirdos, most of which aren't even Italian.",

Goes for food, clothes, hairstyles, languages, whatever. \n\nThe fact that certain groups in Europe have succumbed to stupid-ass food chauvinism doesn\u2019t mean that that\u2019s a real expression of the actual food culture and heritage in those same countries. And it doesn\u2019t mean that food gatekeeping is any less cringe no matter what the reason is (being Italian, being Italian-American, being American but wanting to be more worldly than the average American, just being a jerk in general, whatever). \n\nYOU think this is insulting to Italian heritage. Imma say that you\u2019re about as correct as that American-Chinese dude who had an internet stroke from some highschooler wearing a [qipao to prom](https://amp.knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/keziahs-chinese-prom-dress). As in, go ask the average Italian/Chinese about these supposed culture crimes and you\u2019ll find the average person in those cultures dgaf. \n\nI\u2019m from Sweden, the champion of r/pizzacrimes. Do Italians -actually- get upset about Swedish pizza? Do they see it as diluting their national pride or cultural heritage? No they don\u2019t. They simply don\u2019t view it as pizza. Just like Chinese poeple don\u2019t view crab Rangoon and General Tso\u2019s chicken as being actual Chinese food.",

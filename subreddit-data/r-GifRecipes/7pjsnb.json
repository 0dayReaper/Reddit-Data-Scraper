Do not let it catch fire (constant rotation helps). If you're going to put it on a smore, let it cool before removing from the stick, because if you did it right, the inside will be liquid at first. Let congeal for a minute or two, and then remove. \n\nAlso, if you're making smores, the chocolate should be put on one gram cracker and placed near the fire until it is slightly melted. Not liquid, but soft. Then add the marshmallow, then the other cracker.",

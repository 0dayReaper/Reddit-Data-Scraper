If it\u2019s something like these mushrooms you wait till later because otherwise you\u2019ll burn the garlic and lose flavor. Hope that helps :)",

Raw garlic is very strong but garlic that's been simmered in a stew for 2 hours is much more mild. A lot of vegetables are like that. Onions are another example, which is why many people dislike raw onions but like cooked onions.",

A lot of people don't like mushrooms because they are slimy when you cook them.  Continue cooking them.  Let all that water boil out and evaporate then you get that nice caramelization (which is fancy talk for \"burning on purpose,\" so is \"charred\") and deep flavors.  Then add in more liquid, which the mushrooms will absorb and you get that nice earthy, nutty flavors with your delicious pan sauce.",

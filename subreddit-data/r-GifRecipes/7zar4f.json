So, she took baby Achilles to the underworld to dip him in the river Styx to make him immortal. Now, the Styx is a fast moving river, so she had to dunk him by holding something, but whatever she was holding would be technically mortal. So she grabbed him by the back of the ankle (what we now call the Achilles tendon) and dipped him in, very fast.\n\nHe would eventually be killed by an arrow to that part of his body.\n\nThe person in the gif dipped the steak using the tip of the steak, much like Thetus did to her son.\n\nEdit: obligatory thanks for the gold!",

Go with a basic vegetable oil or canola.  I have no idea what an eggland's best egg is.  My guess is that it is just an egg.  A tip if you  decide to make this.  1) let the steak sit with flour on it for 10 mins or so (I let the oil heat up as the steak rests) to prevent the crust from sliding off.  2) Get the oil very hot like almost smoking before dropping in the steaks.",

There are scratches all down them now. I thought my wife was going to cry when she saw them. They aren't very expensive, but my wife uses them all the time. My mom just doesn't understand you shouldn't scratch non-stick stuff. We ask her not to stir things in our pots with forks and metal spoons, and on Christmas my mom wanted to make something and I said \"ok, grab that pan but just please don't use any metal utensils on it\". She said she just wouldn't make anything then because she'll damage it. I told her to just use the silicone stuff and she wouldn't do it. My brother's mother in law ended up making it because my mom was being weird about it. We have silicone spatulas, whisks, tongs, etc. but she still won't use them for some reason. I just don't get it.",

Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat until ripples begin to form.\n1. While the oil heats, whisk 1 cup flour, onion powder, paprika, cayenne, salt and pepper together in a medium bowl. Set aside.\n1. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg and water.\n1. Season the steaks with salt and pepper. Dredge one steak in the flour mixture, then the egg and then back in the flour mixture to coat.\n1. Add the steak to the skillet.\n1. Repeat with the remaining steaks adding more oil as needed. Work in batches if necessary as to not overcrowd the pan. (Overcrowding will cause the steaks to steam and the coating will not get crisp.)\n1. Cook the steaks for 3 to 4 minutes or until crisp and golden brown. Flip the steaks and continue cooking for an additional 4 minutes until golden.\n1. Transfer the steaks to a platter or baking sheet and cover with foil to keep warm.\n1. Add the remaining butter to the skillet and sprinkle with the remaining flour. Whisk together in the pan and cook until golden.\n1. Slowly whisk in the chicken stock and continue cooking until thickened.\n1. Stir in the milk until smooth and beginning to thicken. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n1. Serve the steaks immediately with the gravy.\n\n[source](https://www.recipegirl.com/chicken-fried-steak-with-country-gravy/)",

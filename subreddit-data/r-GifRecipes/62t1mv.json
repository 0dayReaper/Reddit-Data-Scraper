Lets just halve that 122 to 61 for whisking only. Lets also halve that 45 minutes to 22.5 minutes for just whisking.\n\n17 hours = 1020 minutes\n\n1020min/22.5min = 45.33\n\n45.33 is the amount of times that we've burned 61 calories. which in total equals 2765.13 calories burned.\n\nThe total calories in this recipe is 3,600. If we subtract the 2765.13 burned calories from the total then we'll really see how bad it is.\n\n834.87 calories.\n\nHow bad is that? It equals 4.911 crunchy tacos from Taco Bell.",

I couldn't find any information about how many cals would be burnt whisking for 17 hours. I thought the act of some mildly vigorous male masturbation would be similar to a good whisk. Some internet searching put me at a figure of 5 cals burnt per minutes for a nuice wank. 17 hours is 1020 minutes. Which makes a nice 5100 calories burnt during the recipe. Not sure if this also includes the calories you need to just survive for 17 hours. If someone could figure out exactly how many cals would be burnt flogging the dolphin/whisking that would be great. I'm not a fan of these floppy figures.",

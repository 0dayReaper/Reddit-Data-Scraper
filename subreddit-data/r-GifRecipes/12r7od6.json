The night before you make these brownies, create 2 tsp dollops of Nutella and place them onto a baking sheet (or container).\u00a0Freeze\u00a0overnight.\n2. Preheat oven to 350F (325F convection bake). Line 9\" x 9\u201d baking pan with parchment paper. Set aside.\n\nBrownie Mixture\n\n\n1. In a large bowl, start by whisking together melted butter, sugar, and cocoa powder. Add eggs and vanilla. Whisk. Add flour and salt. Mix well until combined. Set aside.\n\nCheesecake Mixture\n1. In a medium bowl, using an electric or hand mixer, mix together cream cheese and sugar. Add egg yolk and vanilla, mix until well incorporated. Set aside.\n\nAssembly\n\n1. Spread \u00bd of brownie mixture onto bottom of lined baking pan.\n2. Add 6-7 frozen dollops of Nutella on top of brownie layer.\n3. Alternate between adding dollops of brownie and cream cheese mixture to different areas of the pan. Continue until pan is filled.\n4. With a knife, gently create a swirl pattern throughout the mixture. Add scattered spoonfuls of Nutella on top of swirled mixture. Lightly swirl Nutella into into the brownie/cheesecake batter to create a swirled effect.\n5. Bake at 350F (or 325F convection bake) for 32-37 minutes, mine were perfect after 35 min. Brownies will be firm at the edges and slightly wet in the centre. (Note: These brownies will continue to cook once you remove from oven so slightly wet dough on a toothpick while the mixture is firm at the edges is okay).\n6. Let cool for 10-15 minutes before removing from pan.\u00a0Brownies can be let to cool completely on a flat surface or in baking pan. Cut and Enjoy! (or chill cheesecake brownies in the fridge for 1-2 hr \u2013 then serve)\n\nEdit: Updated Ingredients",

They are a staple of our Christmas dinner but we don\u2019t tend to eat them outside of the Christmas period.\n\nWhat you have posted we would probably call sausage rolls although we\u2019d avoid the weiners and go for loose sausage meat wrapped in classic or rough puff pastry, but can include other ingredients and seasoning. Unlike pigs in blankets these are found year round. Most of our sausage rolls are standard meat and pastry but typical extras would be herbs such as sage and thyme, smoked bacon and cheese, or fruit like apple, apricot or cranberry. \n\nIf Americans call sausage rolls pigs in blankets then that\u2019s totally cool with us but you shouldn\u2019t deprive yourself of British pigs in blankets! Possibly my favourite part of Christmas dinner...",

There is something about hot cream cheese and the hot, sour, watery pepper that is in no way balanced out by the half slice of greasy bacon that makes me genuinely gag. However, throw a sausage and pastry in the mix and I think we\u2019re in business.",

Yes, though not as much as I would have enjoyed it if I'd made it properly. \n\nWould i give people my fuckup recipe (if i could remember it) when they asked me for a carbonara recipe? Absolutely not, because when they say they want carbonara, i assume they mean proper carbonara, not my runny mess.",

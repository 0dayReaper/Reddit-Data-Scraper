If it's good matcha, it's a waste. If it's bad matcha, you've ruined the dessert. \n\n",

I question who would actually eat this, though. \n\nAdditionally, I guess the succulents are made from marshmallow fondant where the powdered sugar is replaced with candy melts. I'm sure it could be made to taste better somehow, maybe an extract in the fondant to give it a distinct flavor beside just being sweet. Also maybe some tastier things for gravel/pebbles instead of jelly beans, like ground chocolate. \n\nEdit: Despite watching the gif with my own eye balls, I apparently cannot read. Still though, I imagine actual ground chocolate would look slightly less adorable and would taste a lot better than shiny waxy deco chocolate rocks. ",

Especially since there's a pizza place a couple miles away that I really really love that doesn't deliver but I want pizza without putting pants on so I just make Uber get it for me",

You could just get a bunch of pistachios and grind them up in a coffee grinder or even just a blender/food processor until they're decently small. It gives the same effect while being super tasty",

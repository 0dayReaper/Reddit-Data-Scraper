            "comment": "**Recipe here originally:** [**One-Pot Sausage and Orzo with Whipped Ricotta**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/one-pot-sausage-and-orzo/)\n\nYou can also follow [**@triedandtruerecipes**](https://www.instagram.com/triedandtruerecipes/) **on IG** for movies, recipes, and all sorts of other nonsense.\n\nSorry i don't know why there is audio on this!!!\n\nI was almost not gonna share this recipe at all because it really didn't look good in anything but intense studio lighting, lol...but my husband absolutely loved it, so what the heck. This is just a recipe to make when you have zero alliums in your house (i didn't have a single onion, shallot, or clove of garlic to my name...).\n\nAll I had was celery and some huge-ass parsnips, so I decided to make something out of it. Using the celery leaves is a great way to bring in a little more aromatic, salty-ish celery flavor to the dish.\n\nI think I'm gonna experiment with it further...I actually think it would be prettier with rigatoni instead of orzo.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 pound hot Italian sausage, loose\n* 4 ribs celery with leaves, trimmed and sliced; leaves minced and kept separate\n* 3 parsnips, peeled, trimmed, and sliced into half-moons\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more to taste\n* 1 cup orzo\n* 3 cups water or chicken stock\n* 1/2 cup ricotta cheese\n* 3 tablespoons freshly minced parsley, divided\n* 1 lemon, juiced and zest; zest kept separate from the juice\n* Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for serving\n* Extra virgin olive oil, for serving\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n**Brown the sausage:**\n\n1. Turn the heat on a large pot to medium-high. Crumble the sausage into the pot. Cook, turning the sausage occasionally, for 10\u201315 minutes until browned and cooked through. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, leaving the fat in the pot.\n\n**Cook the celery and parsnips:**\n\n1. Add the sliced celery ribs and parsnips to the pot. Cook over medium-high heat without moving for 5 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until the parsnips begin to char and soften, about 10 minutes total. Turn the parsnips occasionally as they cook, but don\u2019t disturb them too much.\n2. Season the parsnips and celery with garlic powder, crushed red pepper, and add the minced celery leaves.\n3. Return the sausage to the pot and add the orzo. Toss to combine and season once more with salt and pepper.\n\n**Simmer the orzo:**\n\n1. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes or until the orzo is al dente. Stir the orzo occasionally to ensure that it\u2019s not sticking to the bottom of the pot. Taste and season.\n\n**Prepare the whipped ricotta:**\n\n1. Place the ricotta cheese in a large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons minced parsley and lemon juice. Whisk until smooth. Taste and season with salt. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.\n\n**Prepare garnish:**\n\n1. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1 tablespoon minced parsley with the lemon zest. Add a pinch of flaky sea salt and mix to combine. Set aside.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Spoon the whipped ricotta onto plates. Pile the sausage and orzo on top. Sprinkle the parsley and lemon zest mixture on top; finish each plate with a sprinkle of parm and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Enjoy!",

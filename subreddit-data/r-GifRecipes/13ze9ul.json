In a small saucepan, combine fruit (blueberries and mangos), honey, cornstarch, and water, and bring to a boil over medium heat.\n2. Stir over heat for approximately 2-3 minutes or until fruits are glossy and slightly thickened (note: thickening will occur quickly, don't forget to stir frequently to prevent thickened lumps).\n3. Remove from heat. Add freshly squeezed lemon juice and mix.\n4. Place blueberry mango filling into small bowl, cover with plastic wrap (to prevent skin from forming) and let cool.\n\nTurnovers\n\n1. Preheat oven to 400F (or 375F convection bake).\n2. Line baking pan with parchment paper. Set aside.\n3. Place thawed puff pastry on flat surface with 1 tbsp of flour to prevent sticking.\n4. Unfold pastry sheet and cut into 4 squares. Place puff pastry squares onto prepared baking pan lined with parchment paper.\n\nAssembly\n\n1. Add 1-2 tbsp of blueberry mango filling to the centre of each puff pastry square.\n2. In a small bowl, whisk together egg with water to create an egg wash.\n3. Brush egg wash over two intersecting sides of each puff pastry square and fold in half to make a triangle. Press edges together with fingers until a tight seal is formed. Crimp edges with a fork.\n4. Create 2 slits in centre of each puff pastry triangle (note: this step allows for steam to escape during baking). Add egg wash to the surface of each turnover and top with coarse sugar, as desired.\n5. Bake pastries at 400F (375F convection bake) for ~20 min or until golden brown. Remove from oven. Let cool on baking rack.\n6. Enjoy!",

Seriously though, after you put down just three slices of steak, reading that line made me LOL.\n\nThat garlic looks really interesting, is it home grown or is it just sold like that where you live?",

So for the rest of the year its the normal garlic.\n\nThe problem with the presentation is that I just want to eat the damn thing before it goes cold. And I sort of can't be bothered to try and find the best shots.\n\nI need to find some form of presentation method that I can use over and over again. That way the shots will be good, the food won't go cold and everyone will be happy.\n\nDo you have any suggestions for better presentation or shots?",

My dad had just given me a bag of potatoes and I must have used about 2 kilos. \n\nI made about half into gnocchi and the rest left it as dough and froze everything. I got the gnocchi out the next day and when defrosted they went all mush, like they literally flattened out they where so soft. I had to throw everything away.\n\nI guess maybe gnocchi shouldn't be frozen? They were good when I made them. I even boiled a few just to see for consistency how they were. They seemed just right.\n\nBut yeah, it's not really worth the time. I spent about 2 hours making those and had 2 big freezer bags full of ready made gnocchi plus the dough.",

Just because you use sushi rice doesn't make it sushi.\n\nEdit: When I said \"sushi rice\" I mean the [type of rice](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/guide/658/types-of-rice.html) used (e.g. arborio, brown, jasmine, etc.) This recipe calls for using the type of rice called sushi, but in the recipe does not season the cooked rice in a way to make it sushi.",

That term can mean *both* the sweetened and vinegared rice (sumeshi), and the short-grain rice variety that is most commonly used to make sumeshi. So you can use \"sushi rice\" for many applications, but it only becomes *sushi* when it's seasoned. Hopefully that helps and I'm not just muddying the waters more, haha.",

But this recipe only calls for using the [sushi variety of rice](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/guide/658/types-of-rice.html). Nowhere in the recipe is the process of adding vinegar and sugar to the cooked rice to make it sushi which makes the recipe nomenclature imprecise. \n\nI'm all for fusion food and riffing off of different food cultures-- it's a natural process that can have amazing results (e.g. Japanese curry, anyone?) but I feel it's important to be aware of the heritage and significance of ethnic foods and be respectful of it in this day and age.",

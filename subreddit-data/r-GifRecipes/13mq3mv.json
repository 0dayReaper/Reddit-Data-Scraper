I used to be a strict vegetarian, but \\~5 years ago I started eating fish too. I found myself actually craving it, which I think was my body telling me I needed iron and protein.\n\nEveryone's diet is a personal choice, so just know that whatever you land on is fine. It's good. It's the right thing for you. There are more animal-friendly meat options out there, like pasture-raised products from animals that got to have a nice life living out in a field. It's way more expensive than other options, so it isn't the right choice for everyone. I've also heard about people doing meatless days, just to make a smaller change to reduce their meat intake. That's great too. Whatever you want to do is the right choice. I hope we'll all see a future where ethics don't need to be involved in eating meat, because any livestock animal is treated with compassion and care. But the world we live isn't your fault, so you don't need to feel guilty about it imo. I hope this helps in some way!",

It's okay if there is a little pink showing on the top, it will cook in the sauce anyway. It also means it isn't completely dry from browning. Bonus is you get brown bits on bottom of pan to deglaze.\nMake sure to pat dry the meat to remove excess moisture for more effective browning and bring it to room temperature before tossing onto a hot pan.\n\nAlternatively, reduce the sauce in an oven. Sauce will brown on top and you can stir that back in for extra flavour.",

Clearly one can use whatever is available, only it does not look good if in the finished ragu' you still see large pieces of tomato, considering that the long cooking time should get rid of them.\n\nWhile the \"official\" recipe in principle has been deposited to the Bologna's Chamber of Commerce, here essentially every households uses its variant of the recipe.\n\nFor example, in my house (I was born about 80Km from Bologna) we indeed use a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg (which is facultative in the traditional recipe),  mixed meat (beef+pork+1 or 2 sausages or some non-smoked pancetta), less milk than in this recipe, white wine, no broth (there is already a lot of meat and vegetables, broth is not going to make a significant addition). Sometimes a bay leaf.  No tomatoes, only tomato paste. No red pepper flakes.",

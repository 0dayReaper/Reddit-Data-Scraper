The only exception I can think of is keta and I suspect that's just because I don't live in Alaska. IME the trick to enjoying salmon is understanding that despite the common name they are very different from a culinary perspective. Each is amenable to different techniques and should be cooked to different temperatures. The keta salmon, for example, would come out quite dry and chewy and earthy tasting when pan fried like this GIF. Eating it on its own would be less enjoyable than a lot of other species. On the other hand, slowly simmering it in about 2x as much butter and then mixing it into fried rice keeps it tender and uses the earthy flavor instead of trying to avoid it. Many of the most popular salmon species have too much fat content and too large of layers to mix into rice well.",

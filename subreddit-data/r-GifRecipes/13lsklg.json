Press mixture evenly into the bottom of the pan. Bake for ~20 minutes or until edges are golden brown.\n\nMango Lemon Curd\n\n1. While crust is baking, whisk together eggs, sugar, and flour.\n2. Place the flesh of 2 ripe mangoes into a food processor/blender and puree until smooth.\n3. Once crust is baked and removed from oven, whisk mango puree and lemon juice into egg mixture. Pour over the baked crust.\n4. Return baking pan to the oven for another ~30\u00a0minutes or until mango curd is set to a slight wobble. Allow to cool completely in baking pan.\n5.

The gnocchi was time consuming to make, but damn it was good. All that potato and half and half makes me feel guilty tho haha. Only change I made was adding some crushed red peppers. Next time I make it, tho, I\u2019m going to cook the chicken in a separate pan to color it, then add half the spices, then after cooking that a little more, add some broth to pull up the find and pour it all in the pot. Amazing recipe tho! Thanks for sharing.",

I'm fond of the Oatly brand cream, but I also regularly use Alpro (soy) and Elmlea Plant-based (lentil) when it's not available.\n\nI also occasionally use soy yogurt as a substitute, particularly for sour cream but also occasionally for regular cream.\n\nPersonally I'd recommend against using coconut milk.

The only change is you need to temper the greek yogurt and add it at the very end. Anything near a simmer and it will split.\n\nAs for squash, it already goes [great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf4Rz1Wozkc) with gnocchi. I'd dice it to the same dimensions as the carrots. I have made the linked sage-squash-brown-butter gnocchi before, so I am fairly sure this will work.\n\nI recently made similar substitutions for some homemade ragu bologenese. My experience is that each extra healthy substitute takes away from the umami a little bit, but you can easily compensate. I have had success with stock, dried anchovies, fish sauce or balsamic vinegar. Saute the tomato paste in the oil too. Using an animal fat instead of neutral oil also helps. I'd cook some chicken fat off the thighs and then let the thighs gain some fond off that oil before adding the other stuff. Lastly, be liberal with the nutty cheese when garnishing. The nutty cheese will make up for any umami you might have lost, without adding too many calories.                      \nYou save about 500 calories by using '1 cup milk + 1 cup yogurt' instead of '2 cups half-n-half'. So you can put an additional 1/4 cup of Parmesan on top (100 calories) to compensate for umami, and still come out 400 calories lighter. \n\nLastly, if you are having problems with thickening your sauce, then the problem is with using too much water to cook your pasta. Cooking pasta in little water allows you to get super starchy water that will thicken up any dish without extra fat.\n\n________\n\nI am not usually the one to complain about essential fat in a dish. But in my experience, too many dishes add unnecessary calorie dense fat in the form of heavy cream &amp; oil that can easily be removed without taking away from the final product too much. \n\nI have successfully recreated a healthy Gumbo, healthy ragu Bolognese and healthy 'creamy-tasting' pasta dishes and no one noticed the substitutions.",

I understand there are limitations if the goal is to keep it to one pot. \n\n\nAlso, tomato paste benefits greatly from blooming in oil until browned, gives a much more complex flavor than the tinny flavor when straight from the can or tube. This one actually looks better than most because it at least gets some of the residual oil from the chicken/mirepoix combo but I\u2019d personally begin with the tomato paste first to make sure the flavor deepens.",

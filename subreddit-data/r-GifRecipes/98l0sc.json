This is why I stick to crust-free protein cheesecake.\n\nIf you make cheesecakes often, the best strategy is to use Greek cream cheese (tastes like normal cream cheese with extra protein and less fat/calories) or fat free cream cheese (tastes different, but 30% the calories of real cream cheese).  Also sub out sugar for a zero-calorie alternative like Splenda.  \n\nNot everyone is a protein-obsessed binge eater like me though.  If you really want to do this recipe, I'd at the least recommend using Greek cream cheese and Splenda.",

My personal favorite is to use 4oz Greek cream cheese and 8oz of fat free cream cheese with 2% Fage Greek yogurt.  When I get sick of vanilla, I make it with chocolate protein powder, some cocoa powder, and some peanut butter powder.\n\nIt's so delicious that it's easy to forget the stuff is over 50% protein.",

Take out about a 1/3 for mixing into pie and topping. Mix the rest with 4 tablespoons of cooled melted butter. Press into sprinfrom pan or pie dish then place in fridge or freezer for 10-20 minutes)\n\n1 package of cream cheese at room temperature\n\n1/2 tub of Cool Whip (or whip 3/4 of heavy cream)\n\n1/2 can of sweetened condensed milk (add 3/4 of can of you only have the heavy cream whipped)\n\n6-8 crushed Oreos\n\nWhip cream cheese a bit until smooth with mixer then added whipped cream and sweetened condensed milk. Then fold in crushed oreos and half of the reserved ground oreos.\n\nPour everything into pie crust then top with remaining crumbs and whatever Oreros you have left to decorate with. Put into fridge until cold and you're done! (If your pie is over filled with filling you can always put that on the side and eat it later or make little mini pies with it \n)\n\nHopefully you guys enjoy this recipe. If you have any questions about anything else just let me know! :D\n\n",

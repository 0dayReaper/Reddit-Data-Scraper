I loved it. I wanna make \"carbonara\" and drizzle it on top so much you have no idea!!\n\nIf you\u2019d like to save time, you can skip either the frizzled leeks and/or the guanciale chili oil. As I mentioned in my original post, the cod and orzo are fantastic together on their own and make for a wonderful, quick, easy weeknight meal.\n\n\\-----\n\n**Frizzled leeks:**\n\n* 1 leek, white and light green parts only, scrubbed and rinsed\n* Vegetable oil\n\n**Guanciale chili oil:**\n\n* 4 ounces guanciale, bacon, or pancetta; small-diced\n* 1 small shallot, peeled and finely diced\n* 1 clove garlic, peeled and minced\n* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more to taste\n* \u00bc cup extra virgin olive oil\n* \u00bc cup chili oil\n* 1\u20132 teaspoons maple syrup\n* Pinch of salt, if needed\n\n**Saffron cod and orzo:**\n\n* Pinch of saffron, lightly crushed\n* 2 tablespoons hot water\n* 6 4- ounce portions of cod\n* 1 fennel bulb with stalks; bulb cored and thinly sliced, stalks trimmed and thinly sliced into rounds, fronds reserved for garnish\n* 1 shallot, peeled and sliced lengthwise into thin wedges\n* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* 16 ounces orzo\n* 5\u00bd cups water or vegetable broth\n* 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil\n* 1 lemon, juiced\n* \u00bc cup loosely packed parsley, minced\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Prep the leek:**\n\n1. Before beginning, prepare the leek as it takes the most time. Halve the leek lengthwise and thinly slice both halves into \u215b-inch wide slivers. You may need to separate some of the layers of the leek and slice each layer separately. If you find bits of dirt deep within the leek, don\u2019t fret. You can place all the leek slivers in a sieve and rinse again to remove any stubborn specks of dirt.\n2. Transfer the sliced leek to a paper towel-lined plate and pat dry to remove excess water.\n\n**Steep the saffron:**\n\n1. Place the crushed saffron in a small bowl and cover it with 2 tablespoons of hot water. Set aside.\n\n**Prepare the guanciale chili oil:**\n\n1. Place the guanciale in a large pot (you\u2019ll use this pot later for the orzo and cod!) and turn the heat to medium. Cook, occasionally turning, for 8\u201310 minutes until the fat renders and the guanciale becomes crispy.\n2. Add the shallot, garlic, and crushed red pepper and cook for 3 minutes, turning often and adjusting the heat to prevent the garlic from browning. Once the shallot softens, and the garlic takes on a very light golden color, spoon the mixture into a bowl. Scoop out all but a tablespoon of the fat from the pot and add it to the bowl of guanciale.\n3. Pour the extra virgin olive oil, chili oil, and maple syrup over the guanciale. Stir vigorously to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Add more maple syrup, chili oil, or crushed red pepper, depending on your preferences.\n4. The guanciale oil will keep in an airtight jar for up to 5 days.\n\n**Prepare the saffron cod and orzo:**\n\n1. Pat the cod dry and season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Return the pot of remaining guanciale fat to medium heat. Add the sliced fennel bulb and stalks along with the sliced shallot. Season with salt and cook for 5\u20136 minutes until the fennel softens.\n3. Add the garlic and cook for 1\u20132 minutes until just fragrant.\n4. Melt the butter into the pot and add the orzo. Stir to coat and cook for 1\u20132 minutes until it begins to toast lightly. Season with salt.\n5. Pour in the water or broth and boil for 2\u20133 minutes. Stir often to lift any orzo that may have stuck to the bottom.\n6. Reduce heat to low and arrange the cod on top. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil. Drizzle the steeped saffron mixture, ensuring that each piece of cod gets some saffron water.\n7. Cover and simmer over low heat for 12\u201315 minutes or until the cod is opaque and the orzo is tender.\n\n**Frizzle the leek:**\n\n1. Note: Use a saucepan that has somewhat high sides. Generally, you want a saucepan at least 6\u20138 inches deep. This is because when you add the leeks to the hot oil, the oil will foam vigorously, and you do NOT want it pouring over the edges.\n2. As the cod simmers, make the leeks. In a saucepan, pour in 2 inches of vegetable oil. Turn the heat to medium-high. Break off a piece of leek and add it to the pot; if it bubbles rapidly, it\u2019s ready to fry.\n3. Add a handful of the leeks to the oil in small batches. Stir occasionally and fry for 15\u201320 seconds until golden brown. Remove and\u2013using tongs\u2013transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Continue until all the leeks are fried. Pat any excess oil off from the tops of the leeks with a paper towel and season with flaky sea salt. Set aside.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Spoon the cooked orzo into shallow bowls and place a piece of cod on top. Arrange the frizzled leeks next to the cod and drizzle with the guanciale chili oil. Sprinkle a few bits of fennel fronds on top if you remember (unlike me\u2026). Enjoy!\n\n### Notes\n\n*The video shows the chili flakes added to the guanciale chili oil after the guanciale is fried. I recommend adding it to the pot with the garlic and shallot to let it cook into the aromatics a little.*",

(1) it\u2019s cheaper; (2) it\u2019s less wasteful (though that may be illusory as it\u2019s not like I\u2019d throw out my frying oil); and (3) it builds on your existing flavour profile. There\u2019s already so much going on here that I don\u2019t think I need (or can really appreciate) the olive oil notes here.",

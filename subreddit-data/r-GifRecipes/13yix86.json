But I understand you may be rotating it from portrait to vertical to better fit the format for social media posts. \n\nI also like the nutritional note at the end, very helpful!",

It's not something we can learn from, particularly people like myself who don't have experience cooking a wide variety of things. \n\nMost people who need to learn how to cook need a full \"how to\" video with specifics, instructions, and tips, and if you're already recording the whole process to cut down for a drool-inducing gif, then you can also put a full-sized \"how to\" on YouTube or whatever else.\n\nThe gif format is awesome for mass marketing and for getting nice glory shots to entice people, but I personally have never seen a 60 second cooking video and attempted anything similar and every time I've tried to save it or write down the idea that was inspired, I never actually attempted the recipe. \n\nAnyway, the recipe does look awesome!",

If your recipe is only healthy because it includes a tablespoon of sugar but the video only says \"add sugar\" then the recipe isn't quite as healthy if the viewer guesses and adds 3 tablespoons. \n\nAlso little descriptions of why a substituted ingredient is healthy helps too. If your recipe calls for olive oil to be healthier, then a quick ping of \"6 grams less polysatuarated fat then vegetable oil\". It helps people know why a meal is a healthier choice which makes it easier to make healthier decisions for other meals. \n\nWhen it comes to healthy eating, it is far more impactful to understand what makes something is healthy than it is to learn one salad recipe.\n\n\"Hacks\" for getting full flavor with less of an ingredient will also drive engagement. Like using sea salt instead of table salt because it's more flavorful so you can use less.",

My critique is perhaps explain that it's good to cut off the little end of the brussel sprout, for some people trying this recipe it'll be their first time cooking with a brussel sprout and they won't understand that step unless you specifically say it. And I agree with leaving out the price. It'd be better to proportions of brussel sprout to parmesan instead of the price. Prices are going to be extremely regional. But the proportions can take that place since you're trying to keep it short.",

Omitting it makes it a healthier option, though I can understand why someone would want it if they're new to it. \n\nThis opens the door to my tip to people who \"don't know how to cook\": learn a few simple sauces/glazes. Even a bottle of store bought balsamic glaze adds a ton of flavor, and you can use it sparingly. A flaky finishing salt could replace salt from the recipe. \n\nI would also recommend bumping up the temp a bit, at least 425. This helps to get rid of that bitter cabbage flavor and allows the deliciousness of the maillard reaction to be at the forefront.\n\nAs for video quality, I don't know squat about that.",

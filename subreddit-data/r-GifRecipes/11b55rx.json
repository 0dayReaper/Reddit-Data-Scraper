You have what most people consider tender for a small piece of meat like a steak or a pork chop. And that is typically somewhere between medium rare (~135F) and well-done (~165F). However, if you were to cook ribs or a pork butt to that temperature range, you would be very disappointed. That's because fat will break down somewhat and permeate the meat, but other connective tissue such as collagen will not. The breakdown/melting of the connective tissue occurs around 195F. \n\nAnd that's what you get when you stew a piece of meat like this for several hours. Additional connective tissues break down and permeate the meat, along with the fat.\n\nI can give you more examples.\n\nYou can cook an Italian sausage to a safe temperature around 165. Whether you grill it, pan fry it, whatever. Throw it in a bun with some onions and mustard. Delicious, somewhat tender if you don't overcook it, but it is definitely firm and springy when you chew it.\n\nIf instead you throw it in a pot with some tomato sauce (marinara) and stew it for a few hours, the temp obviously gets a lot higher than 165F. And when you bite into it, it is so, so, soft and tender. All the springiness of the meat is gone because all the collagen has been rendered/melted. And this is my favorite way to cook Italian sausage.\n\nHere's another example: pot roast. You don't cook a roast to medium and carve into it like a steak. You cook it all day long, typically in some sort of stew, and it gets to 200F or even higher. Then it literally falls apart when you poke a fork in it. \n\nOf course there are exceptions. Sometimes a roast just doesn't get beautifully tender all the way through, but I  personally think this is a result of not being cooked long enough. And I am not suggesting cooking a rib roast or strip steak to 200F. But a giant pork chop stewed for hours like this? I can totally see it coming out tender as a baby's bottom.",

A trimmed chicken breast won't have hardly any of that.\n\nCooking to very high temp isn't a panacea; it *does* depend on there being some connective tissue in the cut to begin with. Ribs, pork shoulders/pork butt, chicken legs/thighs, whole birds, bone-in chops like OPs, most sausages, pot roasts, all these are good to cook to high temp in this way. Most steaks, chicken breasts, tenderloins, etc. are not suited for this method of cooking.",

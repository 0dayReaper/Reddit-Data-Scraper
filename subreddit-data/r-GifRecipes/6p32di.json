The only thing that throws me off in this recipe is the added onions into the sauce. Usually you want a relatively thick and smooth sauce (no big chunks).\n\nEdit: Mobile bs",

It's not cheap, but it's a great experience. \n\nAlso, the restaurant and chef were featured in Chef's Table, first season. The meld he achieves between modernist cuisine and traditional Mexican cuisine is quite amazing. ",

The mole she made was pretty much an all day affair, thus its rarity. Each item had to be fried, roasted or set ablaze; the tomatoes, the chilies, the bread, then the toasting of the pumpkin seeds. The all day smell was nothing short of divine. Then she adds the chocolate, the darkest that she can find, not something I'd ever seen in the super market and blends the whole concoction together. So far this \"sauce\" is about at the four hour mark and now, she adds the chicken. The wait for this dish is torture. Sneaking into the kitchen with a shag of tortilla dipping it into the \"Its not done!\" sauce.\n\n\nI miss that woman.",

Generally they are added to things to add flavor (i.e. soaked in tea, mulled cider, or cooked down in something and removed at the end like a bay leaf).

In a saucepan set over low-medium heat, combine the chocolate, cinnamon, chili, vanilla and heavy cream, and stir until melted and combined. \n\n2. In a separate bowl, combine the whipped cream and sweetened condensed milk until well mixed. Reserve one cup of this mixture for later. \n\n3. Then, fold the chocolate mixture into the cream mixture, and divide it evenly between 10 popsicle molds. \n\n4. Top the popsicles with the reserved cream mixture and insert a cinnamon into each, to serve as the 'sticks'. \n\n5. Freeze until solid.\n\n6. Dip the pops halfway in melted chocolate, if desired.\n \n**Mini Chicken Mole Tacos**\n\n*Ingredients*\n\n* 2 large chicken breasts\n* 1/2 cup dark chocolate, chopped\n* 5 garlic cloves, minced\n* 1 28 oz can tomato sauce\n* 1 red onion, diced\n* 4 chipotle chilis in adobo sauce\n* 1/2 tsp cinnamon\n* 1 tsp cumin\n* 3 tbsp olive oil\n* 1/2 cup almonds, chopped\n* 1 tsp salt\n* 1 tsp pepper\n* 5 extra large tortillas\n* Toppings of choice\n \n*Instructions*\n\n1. In a pan set over medium heat, combine the chocolate, garlic, tomato sauce, onion, chilis, cinnamon, cumin, olive oil, almonds, salt and pepper. Stir to combine and bring mixture to a simmer.  \n\n2. Add the chicken breasts, nestling them into the sauce and cover the pot with a lid. Simmer gently for an hour.\nMeanwhile, using a 3\" cookie cutter, cut rounds out of large tortillas.\n\n3. Place the rounds in the grooves of an inverted muffin tin, to form little taco shell boats. Bake them for 6 minutes at 400*F. \n\n4. Remove the chicken from the sauce and shred the breasts using two forks. Return the chicken to the sauce and simmer a further 10 minutes.\n\n5. Fill your mini taco shells with chicken and desired toppings. ",

Take the weight that you need and subtract it from what you have. I.E. I need 100 grams, I have 300. 300-100=200. So I need 1/3 of what I have. \n\nMeasuring solids by weight, when done properly with a scale, is more accurate. The way you chop your chocolate and the way I do are different and will give us inconsistencies in our recipes if done only by volume.\n\nTL;DR measuring solids by weight is more accurate, invest in a scale if you want.

Deglaze with your chipotles in adobo and add in the chocolate - when it melts, stir in the tomato sauce. This will develop the flavors of your aromatics, spices and nuts. Also, a few grinds of black pepper would not go amiss at this point, and check the salt levels before adding in the chicken. Otherwise, it's a nice and simple chicken mole (pron. like mole-ay) recipe. ",

            "comment": "I just made the mole for dinner, and I *really* like this recipe. It's got most of the basic elements and flavors of a mole poblano, but it's much more accessible, both for those who don't have a lot of specialty stores nearby and those who don't want to spend a whole day making the sauce. This recipe was a great intro to making a mole sauce, and I've been inspired to go through the ordeal of making a proper mole poblano soon. I used the technique suggested by /u/I_That_Wanders and it turned out great, definitely something I'll be making again since I didn't use the whole can of chilis.\n\nFor anyone looking for advice on the recipe: I topped my tacos with diced red onion, sliced avocado, and some awesome local cheddar and it was incredible. I have two complaints about this recipe though. First, I found it to be a bit too saucy for tacos. I would either use less tomato sauce or throw in another chicken breast (if you can manage). Second, an hour is too long to wait! For the first time in a while I was staring at the timer waiting for it to expire so that I could shred the chicken and eat soon. It's definitely worth the wait though.\n\n10/10 would make again. Thanks OP for posting the awesome recipe\n\nEdit: I forgot to say this earlier. I couldn't find any bulk chocolate that was a desired level of cocoa. All I could find was 100%, ~60%, and something less than that, so I just got both the 100% and 60% and went halfsies",

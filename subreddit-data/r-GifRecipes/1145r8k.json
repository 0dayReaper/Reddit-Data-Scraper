            "comment": "Love it. I do this at least twice a week. Super simple, super healthy, and super tasty, straight to the point.\n\nSome extra pro-tips I\u2019d add from my experience:\n\n-\tSlice the onions first to let them rest, and slice them as thin as possible. Raw red onion is super pungent and can be super bitter when you\u2019re biting into them. If you slice them early and super thin, you 1) allow the onion cells to release more of the bitter molecules in the cell walls, and 2) subsequently end up biting through fewer cell walls at a time, so there\u2019s less pungency\n-\tWith chicken thighs, you *can* precook them well ahead of time. Chicken thighs retain their moisture and texture even at 180F, so if you\u2019re trying to save time by pre-cooking, you can pre-cook your chicken thigh to 155\u2013165 early (eg in large batches at the beginning of the week), and then on meal day, you can just sear it to heat it up without worrying about overdoing the internal temperature (because you have another 10-20 degrees of leeway). Shoutout r/MealPrepSunday \n-\tSalt your tomatoes and let them rest ten minutes\n\nBased mostly on experience and Adam Ragusea + Babish + Ethan chlebowski\n\nEdit: sources\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TDUcQhOzO1Q\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zQm9Bk2bA_Q\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xFX9gz-WMSw",

                    "comment": "That second bullet would be a game-changer and I've never heard of it somehow. So you can take boneless skinless thighs, season then however, cook them up to safe temp (165) and then refrigerate until ready, then use a pan to bring them up to 185 for serving? That's genius and would save so much time during the week. The hardest part about cooking chicken in advance is how hard it is to reheat, but that's a loophole",

It washes away the sulphur taste imo, but some people prefer that.",

In a medium saucepan, combine sugar, with cornstarch and salt. Mix to combine (Note: this is all done OFF-HEAT).\n2. Slowly add milk to the saucepan and stir ingredients together. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture begins to thicken (Note: you may see or may not notice boiling however the mixture will be hot).\n3. In a small bowl, beat egg. While beating the egg, slowly incorporate a stream of the hot milk mixture into the egg.\n4. Remove saucepan from the heat and add all of egg mixture back into the milk mixture while whisking vigorously. Return saucepan to heat.\n5. Continue to stir on medium-low until thickened. Add vanilla extract and butter. Stir to incorporate.\n6. For chocolate custard:\u00a0add 1 tbsp of cocoa (unsweetened) to the sugar/ cornstarch/salt mixture at the outset. Alternatively, you can add a piece of chocolate to custard while it's thickening (add chocolate as desired).\n7. Cover in plastic wrap and allow to cool.\n\nAssembly\n\n1. Fill your baking dish with a single layer of biscuits (Note: the smaller the container you use, the taller the resulting biscuit cake).\n2. Cover layer of biscuits with enough custard to cover the surface of all biscuits.\n3. Place another layer of biscuits over the custard. Cover with custard.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all custard is used (Note: you should end on a custard layer).\n5. Add shaved chocolate (+ walnuts) to the surface of the Bulgarian Biscuit Cake!\n6. Refrigerate overnight, cut, and enjoy!",

We have made it with too much cool whip, too much pudding, and too many crackers before, it always tastes good regardless so the ratio doesn't seem to be all that important. I prefer to stick with the 1:1:1 ratio because once my mom made it with 2 boxes of pudding mix and it was less cakey, more pudding when we went to eat it the next day. (It has to stay in the fridge overnight to soften)",

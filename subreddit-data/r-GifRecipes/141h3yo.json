Canned pease, canned beans, canned tomatoes etc..etc.. are very very common also in the Italian cousine \n\nI'm so sorry if someone here in this group despises this type of ingredients and who use them. \n\nEven if it depends a lot on the quality and here in Italy, but I think also abroad in many countries, we can find excellent canned food (and in fact I payed a lot for them) \n\nThanks for the comment\n\nhave a nice day",

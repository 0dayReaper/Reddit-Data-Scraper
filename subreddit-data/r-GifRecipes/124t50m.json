            "comment": "hello! hi everyone. Wesley here. Today we\u2019re diving back into our series dedicated to Asian fusion cuisine with a dish that I\u2019ve been workshopping for the Woo Can Cook pop up for quite some time now, which is a Shanghainese lion\u2019s head meatball sandwich, or \u201cshi zi tou.\u201d For those unfamiliar, a lion\u2019s head meatball is a traditional Shanghainese classic most iconically made with larger, tennis ball-sized pork meatballs, then braised with bok choy and dark soy sauce, and finally served family style with rice. For those looking, not too long ago, we also did a traditional version of shi zi tou, but today though as you can imagine, a meatball sub like this one has\u2026absolutely no business appearing in Chinese cuisine, the meatball sub originating of course from Italian American cuisine. \n\nSo! For our version today, we\u2019ll be using one of my very favorite combinations of sauces to create our deep and rich braising sauce, while also making a handful of small but very important adjustments to our dish today to accommodate our sub. Most particularly, this will include some adjustments to the size and shape of both our bok choy as well as our meatballs, plus a fun lesson in what happens if you don\u2019t bind your meatballs properly that i learned...the hard way. Hope you try it. [**Follow the full video on youtube**](https://youtu.be/LjO3zuq6m8U) for the whole story too!\n\n**Woo Can Cook** is a series where we reproduce fun foods and recipes from my childhood.

Dark soy sauce is a lot more concentrated than regular soy sauce, and has more of a syrupy thick consistency. This makes it great for braising sauces and marinades, although you\u2019ll want to use it in VERY small quantities (usually for me, never more than a tbsp or so, for a regular recipe).\n\nIn chinese grocery stores you\u2019ll generally see it labeled \u201cdark\u201d or sometimes \u201cblack\u201d soy sauce. In south East Asian grocery stores tho, you might find the Indonesian equivalent, kecap manis (sometimes translated to \u201csweet\u201d soy sauce). \n\nIf ur interested, I also did a whole video dedicated to [pantry basics](https://youtu.be/DvQ4ZRn8TbQ) to dive into more detail on things like this, too \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

Mincing is pretty difficult to do with a dull knife, and you will definitely end up with garlic stuck to the blade. \n\nI think it\u2019s also pretty important to give it a pretty good crush before you chop, cause the crush to the garlic will do 90% of the work (and you really gotta crush it well. This is why the garlic crush almost always shakes the camera in every video, lol). \n\nAll this said, I\u2019m also a big fan of garlic crushers and micro planes, whatever makes it easier for ya to cook\u2026! I particularly like the kind that rock on the cutting board, cause they\u2019re easier to clean \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffd",

            "comment": "Growing up there was a show called Yan Can Cook. Martin Yan was awesome. I have been avoiding your videos because you aren't Martin Yan.\n\nThat all being said i did watch this whole video and you mentioned dark soy sauce...\n\nI learned from watching Yan Can Cook(or possibly him on some other show) that there are different types of soy sauce. So, that the first of your videos I've watched had you distinguish which type of soy sauce you are using is incredibly amusing to me regardless of whether or not it should.\n\nI dont even know why i feel like I'm confessing here to you, I'm sure you are doing awesome stuff. I just wish it didn't always remind me Martin Yan and Yan Can Cook, like i got tricked. (And for the record i am NOT making any accusations!)\n\nLots of love as Jon Williams would say",

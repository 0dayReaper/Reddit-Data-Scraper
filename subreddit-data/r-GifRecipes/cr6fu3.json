If you\u2019re trying to learn to cook, and need every step explained, there\u2019s really no better site out there. If you look up their poached eggs recipe, it\u2019s identical to the one you see here. \n\nMy personal favorite recipes on there are Halal-cart style chicken, skirt steak fajitas and SHAKSHUKA. If you haven\u2019t tried/made shakshuka, give yourself a treat today/tonight.",

Duh. Although stores here are usually more chill than most homes.\n\nApparently around 14C would be ideal but even in lower or higher it's fine but one should avoid moving them from one temperature to another too often. ...I'm still probably going to keep them in the fridge as I'm accustomed to it already.",

You can absolutely get a circulator for for under a hundred dollars. They all work just about the same, it just comes down to how quickly it gets to temp, how much water it can circulate, the noise it makes, and its precision (though they're all very accurate as is).\n\nIn terms of what to cook, steaks are an awesome option, but the one that'll blow your mind the most is a big, thick pork chop. Pork cooked to medium rare is a texture and flavor that everyone deserves to try. It's easy to look up a time/temp, but I like 145f or so. It makes a perfect chop.\n\nOther than that, there are options for desserts, like this cheesecake: [https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/the-quickest-simplest-way-to-make-bomb-cheesecake](https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/the-quickest-simplest-way-to-make-bomb-cheesecake). Hell, you can even sous vide and make cold brew. [https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/recipe/sous-vide-cold-brew-coffee](https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/recipe/sous-vide-cold-brew-coffee)\n\nOptions are endless! Sous vide + smoke will also make Texas quality bbq without much effort at all. Sous vide cooking doesn't work in every situation, but for what it works on, its amazing. Also, obligatory plug for r/sousvide if you want a deeper dive and a little more inspiration.\n\nEdit: formatting",

I like to keep my water at a simmer while cracking all my eggs (most I\u2019ve done in the pot is 14 all at once) into the pot and sit for about 1 minute before I crank the temp and bring to a boil. I\u2019ll bring the pot back down to a simmer after about 3-4 minutes when I\u2019m ready to pull out my soft poached orders. \nThere\u2019s truly not that much to it. Practise, get the motion down, and learn not to overthink it! I think stress transfers into poached eggs as you crack them... they\u2019re sensitive lol.",

Turning the heat off means that the temperature won\u2019t be stable, but the author of this recipe has calculated it so that exactly 4 minutes in water of decreasing heat will cook the egg to the desired consistency. Multiple eggs will result in the water cooling faster, since more cold products are added to hot and the hot has to react. More time in the water will be needed (me, personally, I keep the heat on at poaching temp for however long until I like the consistency of the eggs).",

Their whites hold together better than older eggs. Some people put a little vinegar in the poaching water\u2014the vinegar helps the proteins in the egg whites coagulate. But the vinegar does affect the taste.*\n\n#Ingredients\n\n * 1 egg\n\n#Instructions \n\n\n 1) Heat the water: Fill a saucepan with several inches of water. Heat the water on high until it reaches a boil and then lower the heat until the water is at a bare simmer (just a few bubbles coming up now and then).  \n\n 2) Strain thin whites with a fine mesh sieve: Place the raw egg into a fine mesh sieve over a bowl. The very thin egg whites will drain out through the sieve then gently ease the raw egg into your pot of simmering hot water.  \n\n 3) Turn off heat, cover pot, cook 4 minutes: Notice how there is much less stray egg whites with this method? Turn off the heat and cover the pot (or just lower the heat to low), and cook for 4 minutes until the whites are cooked through. (You may need to add more time if cooking at altitude or poaching more than 4 eggs at once.) \n\n 4) Remove from the pot with a slotted spoon, add salt and pepper and serve over toast or anything you like.  \n\nRecipe Source: https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/easy_poached_eggs/",

It's easy to \"poach\" eggs in little glass saucers or silicone tubs, but the bottom of the egg flattens and just doesn't get that shape that you associate with poaches.\n\nTo get that nice shape, lower the strainer into the water *with* the egg. Then the egg is not allowed to rest on the bottom of the pot/pan. So after placing the egg inside the pot, at first you use a wooden spoon to gently keep the egg white close to the yolk, but as soon as it whitens and sets a bit, keep the egg moving so it does not rest on the bottom.\n\nTip for groups:\n\nMake a bunch of the poached egges, place them in a water container and store them in the fridge for up to 3 days.\nOnce your get your guests, just take a bowl of hot water and place your eggs in there for a few minutes before serving hot!",

Place the bowl in exactly the same spot and experiment! Mine was 58 seconds. Your mileage will definitely vary.\n\nYou may also want to add a piece of string hanging into the water. as this allows bubbles to form around the string, reducing the chance the egg \"pops\". This is more a problem if you do hard-boiled eggs, as that requires more time.",

In America, they put the day number the eggs were packed on each cartoon (today is August 16th, so the day of the year for eggs packed today is 228). The longer the eggs sit in their shells the more the proteins in the white begins to separate from its water content; that's what causes feathering to occur and using the strainer helps get rid of some those loose white proteins (and why it is generally a better strategy than simply adding vinegar to the water). \n\nGiving the water a little swirl as you add the egg will help keep the white together -just don't get a whirlpool going or the white might separate from the yolk entirely (this has happened to me!). \n\nYou can use a larger strainer to do multiple eggs if you want. It can get a little tricky if you try to do too many, though, so make sure you try this with absolutely fresh eggs. \n\nLastly, if you keep your water at that steady bare simmer (instead of turning the heat off for some reason) your eggs will be finished in 3 minutes instead of 4.\n\nAll tips I got here came from u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt",

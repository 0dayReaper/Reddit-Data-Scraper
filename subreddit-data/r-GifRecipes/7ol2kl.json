The dough is in \"ball form\", so you can still smush and roll it and then add toppings, etc. But this way you don't have to deal with flour and yeast and making dough from scratch, if you're not inclined.\n\nThe wife and I regularly buy the olive oil &amp; herbs, and make either a standard pizza on a baking sheet, or a deep dish in an 8\" cast-iron skillet. It's delicious, either way.\n\nI'm sure a purist will come tell me to make my own dough, and they're probably right - more control over the spices and exact flavor, plus you can make more/less easily. But I have eaten a lot of good pizza in my life, and I know the TJ's dough is *good*, even if it isn't *the best*. ",

Spreading the olive oil on top makes no sense because you want the oily part on the heating surface so that it crisps up. I know they used pan spray - but that's blasphemy. Also, without salt the crust is going to be tasteless. The only flavor in this dough is cheese. I know that its typical that all the comments in a food gif hate on the food, but these are some basics of cooking that any pizza dough recipe you google is going to have.\n\nEdit: as many helpful comments (not being sarcastic at all, seriously) have pointed out, not all pizza needs oil in the dough, although the salt is absolutely necessary, as in any baked product. Some people make pizza without oil at all, and some people make pan pizzas with oil in the pan rather than the dough. Nobody, however, uses pan spray to get pan pizzas crispy. That's a sin and an insult to pizza.",

That will give a chewier texture and allow the dough to puff up more, because the gluten can hold carbon dioxide bubbles. For a pan pizza, less kneading is necessary because for something like this you usually don't want as chewy of a crust or for it to puff up as much. The 0 amount of kneading here is too little but it's totally legitimate to make a pan pizza with a less-kneaded dough if that's what you prefer.",

This brings up the final calorie count to 689 calories per slice, a more reasonable number for unhealthy pizza food but still half of what was claimed in the original comment.",

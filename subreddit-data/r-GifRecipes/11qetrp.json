For store bought tomatoes, a pinch of sugar can help as well.\n\n I think if you had grilled your toast and gotten nice lines of char on it instead of the big bubbles of soot, you'd probably get a touch less negativity on toast. Sunflower seeds are a nice nut free alternative for pesto, still get that bit of chewy texture in the pesto as well. I disagree that the flavour is there without nuts tbh.",

Here it is.\n\nFor the Pesto  \n1 handful Basil - (tightly packed)  \n3 medium cloves garlic  \n50g (1.5/2oz) Grated Pecorino or Parmesan  \n4 tbsp olive oil (approx)  \nSalt and Pepper  \nFor the bread  \n4 Slices Sourdough Bread  \nLettuce Leafs  \n2 Tomato  \nOlive Oil  \n2 or 4 Burrata (Depending on Size)  \nSalt and Pepper  \nRecipe  \n1. Roughly Chop Garlic and Basil  \n2. Use a Pastel and mortar to crush down garlic and basil and form a paste (or use a food processor)  \n3. Grind 1/2 tsp pepper and Pecorino and ground down into a paste  \n4. Add olive oil until the paste is of medium consistency - pesto is done  \n5. Cut 4 slices 1 inch thick sourdough bread  \n6. Place the bread on the stove burners and burn them (rather char them moving the bread around so it doesn\u2019t just get a round burnt circle, don\u2019t worry if the bread catches fire, but just be careful)  \n7. When done, spread the bread with the green basil pesto and top it with lettuce leafs  \n8. Add sliced tomato and season with salt and pepper (seasoning is the most important step in this whole recipe)  \n9. Put burrata on top and split it open, add some olive oil and season again.  \nDone. Enjoy. Let me know what you think.",

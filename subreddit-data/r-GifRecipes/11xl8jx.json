Everyone does it from home cooks to test kitchens and professional chefs, and I would argue that it\u2019s not just widespread ignorance, it\u2019s deliberately not going for the texture of a hamburger.  \n\nA meatball is not a hamburger. I would argue you want a slightly dense, incredibly tender and juicy meatball. I don\u2019t think you want a loose, crumbly meatball, I think you\u2019re just regurgitating a tip that applies to one ground meat preparation but not to this one, right down to copying the \u201csausage patty\u201d that everyone talks about in reference to salted hamburger patties. \n\nIf your meatball is dry or dense, you need to work on your panade ratios, the starch and fat added via the panade should absolutely help the meatball retain moisture and juiciness, and the extra non-meat content in general helps the meat not get too dense. I would also recommend reducing egg content if you use that as a binder, as it really *does* cause the texture to get denser and chewier in an unpleasant way, because of how firm an egg sets up once fully cooked/over cooked as it will be in a meatball.",

Salt causes the proteins to bind up and squeeze out moisture at first, but if you let the salt sit in the scrambled eggs for 5 minutes or more, it breaks the proteins down enough that they actually won\u2019t squeeze up at all. It also helps the wisps of white break down and get mixed into a throughly homogenous scramble. \n\nIf you like salt on top of the eggs too, that\u2019s fine! Just reduce the salt that goes in the egg by a bit, but I do recommend salting the interior of the eggs a bit so there isn\u2019t any unseasoned egg.",

I usually do one heavy pinch of salt per pound of meat going in. I also tend to like things with a little more salt, if you prefer less use less, or as the person below you said, just salt the outside before sesring. I've not tried this so can't confirm, I would think the inside of the meatball would be bland and much of the salt would come off when cooking in the sauce, but it's worth giving a try.",

I use cast iron pans to fry items in a little oil (meats, veggies, rice, pizza).\n\nIf I followed this recipe (all one pan), I'd expect to add to the seasoning after washing the cast iron pan.  I like to use bacon grease or 'CrisBee' seasoning.  for a partial seasoning repair, I heat the pan to medium on the stove, add a little oil, coat pan using silicone brush, let oil penetrate while heated for 5 minutes ... turn of heat and let cool before putting this repaired season pan away.",

Deglazing is a nightmare. They make your food taste like metal. And if you're into pumping iron while cooking, cheer up! Because now your 2.5 pounds of meatballs weighs 20.5 pounds...such a pain to get it in and out of the oven. Each of these gripes alone disqualifies them for professional use. Oh, but I forgot you have to treat them like little babies when you wash them.\n\nThat said, this recipe will most certainly yield you a delicious set of meatballs.

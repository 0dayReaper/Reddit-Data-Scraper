Maybe others who've made this can correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nIt just seems to me like making the frozen ganache cylinder is not that hard and would yield a better final product. I would also imagine it's less sensitive to variations in the baking temp and time if done the 'proper' way.",

For whatever reason, if you selected 1 cake only, it was added to your cart with no price ($0.00). You could then go into the cart and change the quantity of that $0 lava cake to whatever number you wanted. \n\nI was worried at first that I'd get found out so I would only order 1. Then I got bold and ordered two, and they came just as they do now, two in a pack. No charge. I decided to push it one time and ordered 8 lava cakes with just two medium pizzas. Total bill was $16. Thought for sure someone at the store would realize something was wrong sending out two pizzas and 8 cakes for $16. Nope, minimum wage employees don't give a fuck, they just see the order and fill it.\n\nAfter that I was like the Don of crunch cakes, you want a crunch cake? You GOT one. I must have gotten hundreds of those things over the course of 3-4 months. Eventually I knew it would come to an end. I was going to write to dominoes in hopes they'd like give me a gift card or something for exposing the glitch, but my gf at the time was like dude, don't blow your cover, they'll just fix it and not give you anything, so I didn't.\n\nLess than a month later they patched the problem, and I still regret not being the whistleblower and maybe getting some free pizza.\n\nAs a totally random button on this story, years later I was helping my company develop their website, and I flew to Detroit to work directly with the developer. At lunch on the first day we were talking shop, and the dev told me one of their claims to fame was developing the Dominoes pizza tracker. I was like, wait, did you just do the tracker or the whole site? Turns out they did the whole site, the app, and tracker! I mentioned my lava cake scheme and the dev almost fell out of his chair, he was like \"I totally remember that issue and patching it!\", he was floored I had the inside scoop on that site glitch he assumed nobody knew about.",

Preheat oven to 450F (425F Convection bake). Butter and flour 2x 8 oz ramekins (shaking off additional flour). Set aside.\n2. In a small microwave-safe bowl, melt chocolate and butter (Note: I recommend heating in 30s increments). Then stir melted chocolate with the butter. Set aside.\n3. In a medium bowl and using an electric mixer, beat egg, egg yolk, salt, and sugar on high until pale and fluffy (~3 mins). Fold melted chocolate and flour into the egg mixture until homogenous, chocolate-y mixture forms.\n4. Divide chocolate mixture amongst two ramekins.\n5. Bake at 450F for ~13 min or until edges are set and they are still jiggly in the centre. Remove from oven and allow the lava cakes to cool for 1 minute in the ramekins. Gently loosen the edges of each ramekin with a knife and invert onto a plate. After a few seconds, unmold lava cakes from ramekins (Note: ramekin will be hot \u2013 be sure to use a towel/oven mitt to handle the hot ramekins).\n6. Decorate with a dusting of icing sugar and berries, ice-cream, or whipped cream. Serve hot and enjoy!",

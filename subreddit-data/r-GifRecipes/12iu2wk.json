As she used to say: \u201cI add some of this. Some of that. Not sure how much. A bit I guess.\u201d \n\n**Ingredients for ~4 people:**\n\n-\t1.5 to 2 cups of kimchi. The more fermented (sour) the better. Store-bought kimchi is usually meh but even there you will find different levels of fermentation. Get some of the brine.\n-\thalf an onion\n-\t3 to 4 spring onions, chopped to ~2 inch pieces\n-\t~1 cup of pork belly chunks\n-\t~1 block of firm tofu, cut to domino-sized pieces. Do not use soft tofu. It is gross and you are gross for liking it. \n-\t~1 tablespoon of Korean chili paste (gochujang)\n-\t~0.5 teaspoon of Korean chili flakes (gochugaru). 0.5 teaspoon = mild, 1 teaspoon = a bit of heat, 2 teaspoons = not for kids, &gt;3 teaspoons = Thai people will smile politely)\n-\t~0.5 teaspoon of salt. You will most likely add more after tasting but it is easier to add saltiness than remove it\n-\t~1.5 cups rice water/person. Since you have to wash the rice anyway, might as well wash a bit more. Use the water from the 3rd or 4th rinse.\nCan be replaced with plain water or any kind of broth. If you want you can make the traditional Korean stock by adding a handful of dried anchovies (a hand of the size an Asian grandma), some kelp (just enough to cover 2 post-its), a quarter cup of sliced daikon and some spring onion roots to water and simmer it for ~20 min. I feel that you can easily mess it up and end up with a stew that smells a bit fishy. I like it but my family prefers the rice water version.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.\tAdd the Kimchi, onion, spring onions, meat and spices to a pot. Simmer for a few min\n2.\tAdd the rice water. Cook for ~10 to 15 min.\n3.\tNow is the time to taste. Add salt and chili as needed.\n4.\tOnce the Kimchi is translucent, add the tofu. Cook for additional 5 min.\n5.\tServe with rice\n\n**Variations:**\n\nIt is easy to make the dish vegetarian/vegan. Please keep in mind that traditional Kimchi contains shrimp paste. Read the label before you buy it.\n\nMy grandma used to cook enough for 10 and added ribs instead of pork belly. Cook until the meat is about to fall off the bone.",

I've eaten refrigerated leftover rice up to a week after (usually in the form of fried rice) with no issues - however, guidance in the form you describe does exist for food safety guidance in a commercial setting, which I agree with. \n\nIf you really think rice is that filthy, why eat it at all? Billions of people eat rice worldwide without significant issues.",

And yes i make fried rice as well but never with rice older than 1 day and properly cooled down. About those billions eating rice with no problem tell that to toerists in India with new deli belly, there's millions of Indian people with no problem ;) i see all kinds of uses for rice water online but they all mention washing water to be used externally. I bet you are ok but for me fermented kimchi and bacteria in rice water is not the best way to ad starch.",

That's generally due to local bacteria that non-native populace isn't exposed to being ingested in uncooked food or local tap water. People coming from Asia to the west can also experience similar symptoms. However, I do acknowledge that other countries have different food prep standards (in some cases, almost non-existent in comparison to the US) and that can cause issues.\n\nAll in all, South Korean cuisine does use rice water in this very common dish, and traveller's diarrhea is much less common there due to the water purification and food preparation standards. Either way, it's being cooked, which kills bacteria. Feeling a different way about it using reliably sourced rice and clean water, to me, seems like not eating chicken stock since chicken has salmonella.",

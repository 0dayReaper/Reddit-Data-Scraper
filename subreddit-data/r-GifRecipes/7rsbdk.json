            "comment": "Want more potency with less impurities?  Here are a few tips...\n\n\n1) For edibles, coconut oil is better than butter.  Butter is just fine but coconut oil is a better transporter of the THC.\n\n\n2) Add an additional freezing step prior to straining the cannabis out of the oil.  The freezing will help break down the cannabis and free up all the good stuff that could be trapped in there.  Do it at least over night, longer is better though.\n\n\n3) Add one or two more \"washing\" steps to pull out more of the weed flavor and impurities.  THC is not water soluble so after straining the cannabis out and pouring into the water to chill over night, heat it up again and pour it back into fresh water to chill over night again.  Each time the water will be a little cleaner as it pulls out more of the stuff we don't want.\n\n\n4) Adding a bit of soy lecithin can increase your body's ability to absorb the THC.  Soy lecithin is an emulsifier and will increase the bioavailability for you to absorb more of the good stuff before it passes through your system. \n\n\nAlso, its important to try and not get your oil over 240\u00b0f.  That is the vapor point of THC and it will start reducing potency.\n\n\nAMA if you have any questions.\n\n\nUpdate:  Wow you guys have a lot of questions!  Which is good cause I like helping.  I'm calling it for now but feel free to ask more and I will get to them later.  Head over to r/treedibles if you want a great resource in the mean time.\n\n\nUpdate 2: I'm back so ask away! Some of your questions can be answered in a couple of my previous posts.\n\n\nThis is my step by step extraction process. This was back when I was using too much oil and have since added a few washing steps to clean up the taste. All you need is enough oil to cover your cannabis.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/3bti1n/black_gold_my_cannaoil_step_by_step/\n\n\nI like making chocolates out of my oil which I posted here.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/5d5en8/fresh_batch_of_chocolates_with_a_hint_of_mint/\n",

Has a very mild funky smell as it cooks that is easy to cover and difficult to identify. If you're worried about the smell, don't release the pressure at the end, let the cooker cool to room temp naturally.\n\nThe temperature inside a pressure cooker at medium decarbs the THCA to THC without approaching the temp where [terpenes/cannabinoids begin to boil](http://marijuanagrowershq.com/decarboxylating-cannabis-turning-thca-into-thc/). Once it's cooled, refrigerate it and then pull the puck of butter off the surface of the liquid. It will be a yellow-green and smell slightly funky.\n\nYou can freeze that, or if you want to improve the colour/flavour, gently melt the butter in a saucepan of clean water, stirring until just combined (don't boil it). Then refrigerate and solidify the butter. Two washes and the butter should be almost yellow and neutral in smell.\n\nBake[ low temperature shortbreads](http://www.practisingsimplicity.com/best-shortbread-youll-ever-make/) (to protect the terpenes - they're good for you!). I roll out the dough between chopsticks for uniform thickness and use a shot glass to cut them to a uniform shape. And test your batch carefully, on an empty stomach. Start with 1/4 of a cookie if you're a lightweight. The strength depends on the strength of the weed you started with, but with even moderately strong weed, 1/2 a cookie will knock a lightweight like me on their arse.\n",

They key is to **start small and don't put anything else into your system for at least 4 hours.**  Once you figure out where your tolerance is compared to the potency of the edible you can go balls out.  Being too baked for too long is not fun.  Waking up stoned from the day before when you got shit to do is totally preventable if you just give it one test run.\n\n\nEdit: To better answer your question though, I started off using WAY too much oil vs cannabis.  Just enough oil to cover the cannabis is all you really need.  There are too many variables with technique and weed potency to figure out potency prior to completing the process.  I would just make sure you didn't have anywhere important to be prior to testing.",

I\u2019m an analytical chemist\u2014think more the guy who would tell you how much lead is in your drinking water than the guy synthesizing some eery, green liquid in an Erlenmeyer.\n\nIn short, the only truly accurate way to analyze for THC content is with a solvent extraction, followed by a technique called LC-MS or GC-MS. You may be able to skip the solvent extraction if you use a headspace GC-MS. Both techniques would require THC standards, as well. (For the pedantic, we do not absolutely have to use an MS detector, but they\u2019re so ubiquitous these days, I\u2019m confident it\u2019s the industry go-to for THC determination. And regardless, the chromatography is still going to be necessary.)\n\nIn shorter, you need a well-equipped lab. The instrumentation needed for *accurate* determination is very common in industry, but you need a well set-up lab for this sort of instrumentation. A person *could* get one up and running in their garage, but it\u2019s not practical, and I can\u2019t imagine how difficult it must be to find and purchase proper reagent grade THC for standards as just a common joe working in his garage.",

Smoking accomplishes this with fire to the bud, but by baking it you raise it to a temperature that allows the THC to activate and get you high.  You could eat the bud after the decarb process and it will get you high, whereas untouched bud will not.  THC is fat soluble so after it's been activated you're just encapsulating the THC in the fat of the butter or coconut oil leaving you with plant material with (hopefully) no THC left in it.",

(Won't you lose a lot of thc through vaporization?)\n\nI always had a different way of going about the entire process and it always worked perfectly fine for me:  \n  \n- Like in OP, I would use water and butter mixed together, but I would skip the oven step. Using water and butter makes it so that your mixture doesn't get above the boiling point of water (212F).  \n  \n- Unlike in OP, after grinding my flower I would use a slow cooker and let the butter/water/flower mixture cook for usually around 12 hours, making sure there was always water in the mixture (since it would evaporate over time).  \n  \n- Decarboxylation occurs at about 220F, but can also be accomplished at the slightly lower temperature of 212F as long as you take more time to do it.  \n  \n- One source I found online states that THC vaporizes at 157C (314.6F), though it will sublimate at lower temperatures.  \n  \n- Another fun way to consume cannabis is making a tincture with vegetable glycerin. The process is roughly the same as with using a water/butter mixture; grind up your flower as finely as you can and put it in a mason jar with as much vegetable glycerin as you prefer (less = more potent, more = less potent) then put that jar in a slow cooker filled with water. The water will allow garuntee that you're heating your tincture at 212F and lower your risk of ruining it. In general, the longer you let it cook the more canabinoids will be absorbed by the VG; last time I made it (and the most successful batch) I heated for about 72 hours. About 1 small glass dropper full under the tongue was about the same as smoking a whole bowls worth.\n  \n  \nSo maybe I got lucky every time I did it that way, but the results spoke for themselves. There's probably better ways to do all of this, and its been years since I've partaken or really even researched the matter, but like I said the results spoke for themselves and my friends and I were always quite happy with the product.  \n  \nEDIT: Don't forget to occasionally stir whatever you're making!",

Plus in my experience it lasts a lot longer, and is more economical because you get a much higher absorption rate than from smoking, as none of the thc is vaporised or lost into smoke or lung inefficiency. Not to mention it's much better for your lungs and whatnot. \n\nFor a lot of people, it is a really roundabout way, but I know some people who only like to get high this way. Maybe they hate smoking, maybe they're athsmatic and want an alternative (though weed has always been pretty kind to my athsma personally) and maybe they're just not in a position where they feel up to smoking a joint eg. Cancer patients who have never tried pot before.\n\nNot an exhaustive list of reasons for edibles by any means but it's a start.",

What I do enjoy doing, however, is to vaporize weed and then take the vaped weed and make butter from that. This \"duff\" weed is what replaces ash when you switch from smoking to vaping. And instead of ash, you get a byproduct that you can use to make incredibly strong cannabutter basically for free. Or, put another way, with this process, your weed gets you stoned twice.\n\nWhen the weed is no longer good to be vaped, it still contains some THC that has been activated by the heat. Collect a whole bunch of that and steep it in a crockpot for 24 hours with a bunch of butter and hey presto: free cannabutter from what was formerly trash!",

Enjoy!\n\n**Cannabutter and How To Cook With It**\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n*For the butter:*\n\n* 1/2 ounce cannabis buds\n* 2 sticks unsalted butter\n* 2 to 3 cups water\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS**\n\n1. Make the cannabutter: Preheat oven to 240 degrees. Place cannabis buds on a sheet tray, and bake at 240 degrees for 40 minutes. (This is called decarboxylation which will help activate the THC. Do not skip this step.)\n\n2. Once baked, the buds will become crumbly. Break them into smaller crumbles and set aside.\n\n3. In a medium saucepan, heat butter and water until they reach a low simmer. Add marijuana crumbles and set heat to a very low simmer. Do not boil. Make sure crumbles are not touching the bottom of the pan; if so, add a bit more water until they float. Cook uncovered for 3 hours, adding more water if necessary.\n\n4. Place a fine mesh colander covered with cheesecloth over a large bowl. Pour cannabutter liquid over cheesecloth colander. Use a spatula to push any excess liquid through. Discard drained buds. Cover bowl in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight. The butter will harden on top of the water. Use a knife to help remove the butter disc from the bowl and discard the water. Your cannabutter is now ready to use!",

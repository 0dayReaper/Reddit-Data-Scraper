Does the gelatin add any kind of small flavour to it or is it all creamy goodness? I confess I've never used gelatin for anything except to make straight jelly. Always been a bit leery in case it comes out weird, but these look cute enough that I definitely want to try it.\n\nIn england we don't normally bake our cheesecake. Usually we whip the cream first, mix the cheese with icing sugar separately and then fold it in. For extra stability I sometimes like to mix white chocolate in. \n\nI remember trying an american recipe for cheesecake for the first time, and it was AMAZING. Without the baking it's a totally different dessert from ours, but the taste is so... moreish. Sometimes I get the craving for the american version.",

It's my go-to gift recipe, but I'm getting older and can't eat endless dairy anymore, so it's also super sickly. The baked version is much lighter, I could eat it by the spade!

There are three types of cheesecake that I know of - baked, not-baked, and not-baked but also has gelatine. The gelatine and the baked versions are considered american recipes. We use the unbaked as default. This recipe feels like a midway point on account of the gelatine.",

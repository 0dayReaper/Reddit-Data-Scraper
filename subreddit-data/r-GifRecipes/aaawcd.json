Cloudiness is caused by dissolved gases becoming bubbles, or by other dissolved matter suspended in the ice. When the freezing happens slowly, and from the top down, these impurities descend into the lower liquid layer instead of being trapped in the ice. The reasons *that* happens start to strain my limited knowledge of physics.",

I've tried to do this with distilled, boiled, reverse osmosis, etc and nothing works but the method in the video.\n\nThe REAL cause of cloudiness is not \"impurities trapped in the water.\" It's because water expands as it freezes, and ice is crystalline. So if you have ice expanding toward the inside from the outside in every direction, then it expands into itself and starts to crack against itself.\n\nBy having it freeze from one direction down, it simply freezes and displaces the water below it so it doesn't crack.\n\nNext time you make ice the normal way, take it out and look at it after it's been freezing for about a half hour. Scoop some ice out of there. It will be crystal clear even if you just used cold tap water. That's because the liquid hasn't completely frozen yet so the ice hasn't cracked on itself yet.\n\nThe method in this video is the one and only way to get clear ice.",

You can use lab-grade 100% h2o and it will still freeze cloudy.\n\nThat's because ice expands and is crystalline. So as the ice crystals expand into each other from the outside in, when they get to the center they push against each other and crack the crystal structure.\n\nThat's why even regular ice is cloudy on the inside and clear on the outside. If you took cold tap water and checked it out halfway through the freezing process you'd find it's completely clear.",

In my freezer 22 hours leads to clear ice, after 24 or so, I start to have to chisel off cloudy stuff.",

I wonder if the gasses in cloudy ice are what make it melt faster.\n\nNow I can totally justify spending $35 on an ice mold to drink whiskey in my dark man cave while I play RDR2.",

Once it's in water and it starts to melt then your drink gets \"inside\" your ice and melts it from all directions so it melts way faster. So yeah, fully solid ice (not cloudy) is gonna melt much slower.",

It can improve the clarity a bit if you have a lot of impurities in your tap water, but it won't prevent cloudiness from forming during the freezing process. \n",

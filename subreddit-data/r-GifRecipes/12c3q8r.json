The first time I made it, I used snow peas but this time, I used green beans. Use any veggie combo you want - peppers, asparagus, sugar snap peas, baby corn, broccoli, and bok choy would all be really good.\n\n**Beef:**\n\n* 1 tablespoon lemongrass paste\n* 2 teaspoons minced ginger\n* 1 teaspoon minced garlic\n* 2 tablespoons brown sugar\n* 4 tablespoons light soy sauce\n* 1 red Fresno chili pepper, trimmed and minced, or use a serrano pepper\n* 1 teaspoon chili oil\n* 1 teaspoon rice vinegar\n* 2 teaspoons cornstarch or sweet potato starch\n* 16 ounces skirt steak or flank steak\n\nI've made this twice in the past week cuz it's that good and super easy to make. The first time I made it, I used snow peas, but this time, I used green beans. Use any veggie combo you want - peppers, asparagus, sugar snap peas, baby corn, broccoli, and bok choy would all be really good.\n\n* 3 tablespoons neutral oil, divided\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and halved lengthwise and thinly sliced into wedges\n* 8 ounces snow peas, tough string removed from both sides of the snow peas *\\*see note above*\n* 1 red bell pepper, trimmed, seeded, and sliced into strips\n* 1 teaspoon minced ginger\n* \u00bc cup water\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**For serving:**\n\n* Cooked white rice\n* Fresh cilantro or minced scallions\n* Lime wedges\n* Crispy shallots\n\n**Make the rice:**\n\n* Before beginning, I recommend making a pot of rice first. Then, keep it warm as you prepare the stir-fry.\n\n**Prepare the marinade:**\n\n* Gather all of the ingredients for the marinade except the cornstarch and beef in a large bowl. Stir until completely combined. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Add the cornstarch and stir until smooth. Set aside.\n* Pat the beef dry and cut (with the grain) into 4-inch long pieces to make it easier to slice into strips. Next, cut the resulting beef pieces against the grain into \u00bd-inch wide strips. Cutting against the grain will yield the most tender beef, so be mindful of how you slice!\n* Add the beef to the bowl of marinade and toss to coat. Transfer to the refrigerator for 15\u201330 minutes.\n\n**Cook the vegetables:**\n\n* Heat half the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once shimmering, add the onion, snow peas, and red bell pepper. Cook in batches if needed. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the pepper begins to char and the snow peas are bright green and tender, about 5\u20137 minutes. Stir in the ginger and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper.\n* Remove the vegetables from the skillet and transfer to a bowl.\n\n**Cook the beef:**\n\n* Add the remaining oil to the skillet over medium-high heat.  Once hot, pour in the beef with all of the marinade. A splatter screen will help with the sputtering! Spread the beef into an even layer. Cook for 3\u20134 minutes until the beef begins to brown and the marinade is bubbling.\n* Crank the heat during the first 3 minutes and watch it closely to develop a sear on the beef without burning the marinade. Then, adjust the heat back to medium-high. It will look like the sauce separates as it cooks, but don\u2019t worry!\n* After 3\u20134 minutes, flip the beef and continue cooking, often turning, for 2\u20134 minutes or until the beef is mostly cooked through.\n* Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and stir to develop a thick sauce. Taste and adjust seasonings. Turn off the heat and stir in the vegetables. Toss to coat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n* Arrange the cooked white rice on a serving platter and pile the stir-fried beef and vegetables on top. Garnish with cilantro, scallions, lime wedges, and crispy shallots. Enjoy!",

Adding the marinade in with the meat in the wok will remove any chance of char on the beef so order is important here.\n\n It is also very very heavy on the starch, about half the amount suggested and it would still thicken up quite nicely.",

Description:

Recipes in an easy to follow gif format.

Rules:

No Spam: Only submissions from i.imgur.com, gfycat.com, and i.redd.it will be allowed. Submitting GifRecipes that you have created to those domains is allowed. You may include a link **to the recipe** on your website or channel in the comments, but please do not use the title or a comment to request new followers or subscribers. Keep in mind reddit's [guidelines on self-promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) as well. 

Include the recipe (or a link to the recipe): Include the recipe (or a link to the recipe) in the comments and be sure to provide a source if it's not your own original content. Do that in reply to Automod's stickied comment. If you fail to do so, your post could be removed.

Be friendly to other users: Be constructive with your criticism. If there are certain foods you do not like it is fine to ask for alternative ways to prepare a dish, it is not okay to graphically describe the vulgar appearance of the food, or to make personal attacks at the user who submitted it. 

Food being prepared: Posts must show food being prepared in a gif format.  All other formats will be removed and posts that do not show preparation will be removed. Just because it has sound, does not mean it is NOT a gif. Don't report a gif just because it has sound.

Reposts: The mods are leaving it up to the community to utilize downvotes if they feel that reposts are too excessive. Please do not complain about x-posts or reposts and do not message the mods about it. If the same recipe appears simultaneously in the top 100, it may be removed at the mods' discretion.

Keep it SFW: If there is a submission showing a gif recipe that an ordinary person would be uncomfortable viewing, please report it to the mods.

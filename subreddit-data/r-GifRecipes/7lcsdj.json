Seal the spiral in with another thin layer of batter\n\n4. Flip when the bubbles happen\n\n5. Voila! \n\nThey're much much easier to flip, the sugar mix doesn't burn, and they're super yummy. \n\nI hope your kids love them as much as my very pregnant self does! ",

Use lower heat than you would normal pancakes so you don't turn the sugar swirl into candy and have it just stick to the pan and destroy the pancake when you try to lift it.\n\nAfter making them I decided I'd rather just have normal pancakes and normal cinnamon buns simultaneously.",

Make the pancake batter: in a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Add the egg, milk, and vanilla, extract and mix until the batter is fully blended.\n1.     Make the cinnamon swirl filling: in a small bowl, combine the melted butter, brown sugar and cinnamon. Mix well. Transfer the mixture to a quart-sized resealable plastic bag and set it aside.\n1.     Make the cream cheese glaze: In a medium bowl, beat together the butter and cream cheese until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla, and continue to beat until it\u2019s fully mixed and no lumps remain. Add enough milk to thin the glaze to your desired consistency, and set it aside.\n1.     Preheat a large skillet or griddle to medium-low heat. Spray the preheated griddle with pan spray, and wipe away any excess. Pour \u00bd cup of the pancake batter onto the prepared griddle.\n1.     Twist the top of the bag containing the cinnamon filling to force the filling into one corner of the bag and remove any trapped air. Then snip the corner of the bag to create a small hole, and squeeze the bag to pipe a swirl of the cinnamon filling onto the center of each pancake.\n1.     When the batter begins to bubble, the pancake is ready to be flipped. Flip the pancake and cook it for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the bottom side is golden brown. Keep the pancakes warm in a low oven or on a plate covered with aluminum foil while preparing the remaining pancakes.\n1.     Drizzle the cream cheese glaze over the warm pancakes and serve.",

It makes the pancakes super soft and the waffles nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside :) ",

The butter mixture will probably still find it's way out, but seems like it could be worth trying.  Just need to make sure both \"layers\" of pancake get a chance to cook through while doing the first side.",

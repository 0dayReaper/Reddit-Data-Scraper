I goog'd it just now, apparently it comes from the french word 'fouler', meaning 'to crush', and not for the emotion you feel when you look up a recipe for it and it has two ingredients and one step.\n\nSo yea, crushed lemons and yoghurt and cream maybe. The BEST combination on a summery day!",

Since the sweetness and lemon flavor is on the outside, it hits your tongue faster and harder, so you don't need to add as much to get the same effect (which equals less calories)",

I\u2019d say 2 eggs would be better but the real improvement on my method would be either less stuff inside or a bigger tortilla. Mine had to be folded in half like a gigantic breakfast taco. I really liked the way the whole thing stayed together after I rested the hot skillet on top of the folded taco for a couple minutes.",

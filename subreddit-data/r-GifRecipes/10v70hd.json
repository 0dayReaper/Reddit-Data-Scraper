France\u2019s is most well known (called mirepoix) which is carrots, celery, and onion.\n\nCreole/Cajun cooking\u2019s trinity is green bell pepper, onion and celery. Chop those up and sweat them in a pan. You can see when they add the mixture into the pot so just sweat them first then add them in after that step.",

Add other ingredients, onion, peppers, celery, garlic, aromatics, cracked whole black peppercorn.   4 hours.    Strain.   And use that.

Tear kaffir lime leaves leaves along the steam before adding them in for great aroma. Cut the stalks of the lemongrass until you no longer see a purple hue in the inner layers.\n2.  Use 1/2 tsp lime peel of one green lime. Add the juice of that lime into the blender later.\n3.  Blend all the ingredients required for the paste in a high speed blender. You should get a thick green paste.\n4.  Add some oil to pan. Once it heats up, add back the paste and saut\u00e9 for 5-10 minutes until the spices cook.\n5.  Cut your tofu into cubes and pan fry them in oil until crispy.\n6.  Add some water to loosen the paste and add in your vegetables. Cover with a lid and wait for it to cook for a few minutes.\n7.  Add more water depending on how dry the curry is, and add in the fried tofu pieces.\n8.  Give that a good mix. Add remaining water, coconut milk and squeeze in some lime juice from 1 lime. Let that simmer for a minute.\n9.  Stir in some thai basil leaves and once they full wilt and get cooked, take off heat. Serve immediately with rice.\n\n[Source](https://browngirlveganeats.com/authentic-thai-vegan-green-curry/)",

I didn't see lime segments thrown in during the paste-making step.\n\nWouldn't that be bitter AF?",

I'd also like to point out that a cook who taught me how to make curry paste specifically told me to use a mortar. \"purists\" often suggest this cause the oils in garlic and other ingredients apparently come out of the ingredients in a different way compared to using a blender or whatever machine this is. Even when making pesto they suggest using a mortar. And i gotta agree. The taste is quite different.",

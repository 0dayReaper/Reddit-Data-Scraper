            "comment": "hello! Hi everyone, Wesley here. Today we\u2019re diving back into our series dedicated to classic Americanized Chinese cuisine with a look at the Chow Mein noodles from Panda Express. For those new to the channel, in this series, we have been deconstructing classic dishes from Americanized chinese cuisine (not unlike the plethora of dishes from the Panda Express menu), then seeing what they might look like when reconstructed through the lens of more traditional wok cooking. \n\nIn more recent memory, this has tended to be really interesting to break down dishes like General Chicken or Bejing Beef, where the dish has no real foundation in Chinese cuisine (and instead really just originates from American cuisine), because frequently, we end up with wildly unique results. For our Chow Mein today however, obviously this dish has roots all throughout chinese cuisine, meaning that we are for the most part going to be taking a look at what makes Panda Express\u2019 chow mein unique (and make no mistake, it definitely is unique) before we construct our own attempt at the dish. Hope you try it. [**Follow the full video on youtube**](https://youtu.be/m21bJSX0VNw) for the whole story too!\n\n**Woo Can Cook** is a series where we reproduce fun foods and recipes from my childhood.

With this method you could pack as many as you wanted into the bag. Like a bundle of 30 and just dump in a fifth. Otherwise you'd only be able to get as many as you could get in flat. You'd probably still want to put in some sort of structure to keep them from turning into feather shapes.",

This is called depyrogenation.   \n  \nYou'd also be putting in a solution with a radically different pH, and your blood's pH needs to be carefully controlled. Your blood has some ability to correct its pH by chemically acting as a pH buffer, but suddenly injecting a load of acid (as these fruits would be) could maybe overwhelm this, depending how much you put in.  \n \nMy initial thought is that the biggest problem would be the large amount of fibre present, which is never supposed to be in your blood stream, and would probably cause blockages. Also I would expect that as there is a lot of organic matter that isn't normally supposed to be there, your immune system would start trying to attack it.   \n  \nSide story: while your skin is impermeable to water, it's permeable to DMSO. I knew a trick some chemists would do (most definitely not recommended as safe in any way) where they would put citric acid on their skin, pour DMSO over it, and the citric acid would dissolve in the DMSO, pass through the skin, enter the bloodstream, and then someone else could smell the citrus smell when they exhaled. So you can, at least, get citric acid into your bloodstream without severe ill effects. ",

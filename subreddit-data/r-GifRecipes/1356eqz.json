He's too young to use a knife that big (he just turned 7) but he sometimes feels discouraged because he's soooo left-handed that he will sometimes not want to try new things because it's not as easy for him, everything is in reverse. When we first got him left-handed scissors a couple of years ago he was so happy. I've been trying to teach him very basic supervised knife skills and so far he's doing well, but we need more people like you serving as models!",

            "comment": "hello! Hi everyone, Wesley here. Today we\u2019re diving back into our series dedicated to Hawaiian comfort food classics with a shot at yet another addition to our ever growing collection of fried chicken recipes, which is a popcorn chicken dish known as \u201cmochiko fried chicken.\u201d For those unfamiliar, mochiko is a type of sweet glutinous rice flour that most iconically is used to make the chewy, sticky, sweet Japanese rice cake desserts known as mochi. \n\nToday however, we\u2019re gonna be using this flour paired with some potato starch to create what I genuinely can say is one of the most unique pieces fried chicken that I have ever come across, due to its slightly sweet and chewy texture which somehow is both chewy and yet still crisp and crunchy, too. Then to round this out, we\u2019ll be making use of a bit of dashi powder to dry season our mochiko chicken (which, come to think about it, I don\u2019t think I have ever actually used to make dashi stock), and finally, a sweet and savory honey siracha aioli to top everything off, borrowed from our chicken karaage recipe a few weeks back. Hope you try it. [**Follow the full video on youtube**](https://youtu.be/P0xR5cu2d8w) for the whole story too!\n\n**Woo Can Cook** is a series where we reproduce fun foods and recipes from my childhood.

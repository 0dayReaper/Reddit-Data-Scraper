Cut tofu into 3 equal slabs. Optional, diagonally score the top surface of the tofu, scoring it about 1/3 of the way through the slab.\n    \n2.  Place the tofu in a shallow dish and drizzle with the soy sauce and lemon juice to coat. In a separate dish, combine the cornstarch, garlic and lemon pepper together. Dredge the tofu in the cornstarch mixture and set aside.\n    \n3.  Heat the oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. When hot, add the tofu and sear for 5 minutes on both sides until golden. Transfer the tofu to paper towels to drain.\n    \n4.  To the same pan, add the asparagus and a pinch of salt. Saut\u00e9 for 3-4 minutes until tender then remove from pan.\n    \n5.  Add the shallots and saut\u00e9 until softened. Stir in the capers, garlic and red pepper flakes and continue to saut\u00e9 until fragrant. Add the miso paste and lightly mash with the back of your spatula. Add the nutritional yeast and orzo then stir to coat.\n    \n6.  Pour in the broth and bring to a simmer, stirring frequently to prevent the orzo from sticking. Allow the orzo to cook for 10-12 minutes uncovered until the orzo is al dente. Once the orzo has absorbed most of the liquid, stir in the parsley, asparagus and remaining lemon juice and remove from heat. Serve with the tofu and enjoy.\n    \n\n[Source](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Csr4FIjJpoW/)",

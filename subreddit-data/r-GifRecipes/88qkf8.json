Internal damage is much more likely and even short amount of times exposed to microwaves can cause burns that require skin grafts and do tissue damage. For a more in depth explanation,  read the [microwave burns Wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_burn)\n",

In comparison with radiation burns caused by ionizing radiation, where the dominant mechanism of tissue damage is internal cell damage caused by free radicals, the primary damage mechanism of microwave radiation is by heat.\n\nMicrowave damage can manifest with a delay; pain or signs of skin damage can show some time after microwave exposure.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

See, all the microwave manufacturers are secretly trying to promote their own brand of microwave popcorn by burning the competition. The popcorn makers became wise to the game and included the aforementioned instruction on the bag. Ironically this ensures that the proper match of microwave popcorn and microwave is never discovered as anyone who reads the bag inputs the correct time and anyone who just presses the popcorn button never realizes the connection.\n\nFurther, a not uncommon number of bags of microwave popcorn contain the \"unstable kernal\". A kernal which, when popped, will detonate with sufficient force to level everything within an approximate 9 meter radius. Fortunately for the average consumer, the unstable kernal usually requires greater cooking time than other kernels and is left unpopped. Knowing this, the microwave manufacturers attempt to microwave the popcorn too long and pop every kernal in order to force the customer to replace their now-exploded microwave oven. Meanwhile the popcorn makers intentionally set their times low to ensure a cascade of unpopped kernels, thereby preventing catastrophe and promoting the consumption of another bag.\n\nIn the midst of all this turmoil, Jiffy Pop said fuck it and decided to just use the stovetop like cavemen because clearly everyone else can't get along.",

You need like 1/2 of a teaspoon for 6oz of corn (you don't need much, this shit is potent). Pop in coconut oil, then melt some ghee (clarified butter) and pour it on. The milk solids in butter will make the popcorn soggy. Ghee, lacking such, just gives you the buttery flavor.",

So for breakfast my team mates and I plus the coaches and other adults on the trip all went to eat at the restaurant and the kids sat at their own table and the adults sat at theirs near us and we all ate our food. Most of the kids ordered orange juices for drinks and the adults all got coffee. The waitress kept coming by both tables  and offering us more coffee and orange juice. She didn\u2019t even ask in most cases she just came around our tables with a pitcher of OJ and a coffee pot and kept pouring more in our cups. I probably drank 2-3 glasses of OJ myself and most kids did the same. When we finished eating and got the check the waitress had charged us for every single glass of OJ she poured. On the menu a glass of OJ was like 2-3 bucks and it didn\u2019t say anything about refills and she didn\u2019t charge for refills of the coffee which is pretty normal at a breakfast diner. Anyway long story short the adults lost there shit when they went to pay the bill and got in a pretty heated argument with the waitress and eventually the manager. They knew she had taken advantage of the kids not knowing(we were like 10 years old at the time) that we were getting charged for every glass and at one point she lied about it being fresh squeezed(it turned out it wasn\u2019t it was just cheap concentrate according to the manager) and the hotel offered us a discount if we came back to stay there again. We did come back and stayed at that hotel for another tournament but never went back to that restaurant again.  ",

For Ramsay that's creme fraiche, but literally anything somewhat cold and mixable works.\n\nI've used onion and chive dip, sour cream dip, Aioli and soft cheese (Philiadelphia) and it all mixes in whilst keeping the eggs nice and creamy.\n\nIf I'm not too concerned about making it perfect, you can scramble 3 eggs in this method in 5-7 minutes easily. Or round about when a nice thick piece of bread is done toasting.\n\nAs said below the time saver is not premixing. You literally put the eggs and butter into the pan, turn the heat on and immediately start mixing.",

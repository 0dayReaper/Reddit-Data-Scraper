This orzo and rice is one of the most convenient ingredients.\n\nWhen I make orzo rice I usually make a big batch (plain) that lasts about 3 days. Then each day I just add different ingredients. For example cherry tomatoes and feta or shrimp and peas. Or if I have left over meat or chicken just mix that with in with the orzo and maybe add frozen peas and warm it up.\n\nThese are 2 of my favorit recipes and both are really simple:\n\n[https://pastawith.com/orzo-and-pea-salad/](https://pastawith.com/orzo-and-pea-salad/) \\- orzo peas and feta.\n\n[https://pastawith.com/orzo-with-cherry-tomatoes/](https://pastawith.com/orzo-with-cherry-tomatoes/)  and this with roasted cherry tomatoes and Italian herbs. This was really surprising how good it is with just basic ingredients.\n\nYou could use fresh cherry tomatoes but roasting them for about 30 minutes makes them so much tastier",

The time was previously to cook for 10 minutes.\n\nHowever, I've just made a pot of orzo rice and after cooking for 10 minutes and letting it rest (covered) for 2 minutes, the rice is a little too soft.\n\nSo I have just updated the post and made it 8 minutes.\n\nI always cook my normal rice for 8 minutes usually.\n\nHow do you generally cook rice? I always bring the water to a boil, cover and let simmer for 8 minutes and its always perfectly cooked.\n\nSo 8 minutes cooking from boiling point, not in total.\n\nLet me know if this makes sense, I'm a bit confused about what to list the timing since rice doesn't have an exact cooking time on the package like pasta. And maybe different brands, although the same type of rice, may require different cooking times.",

I usually mix it with some oil and soy sauce to thin it out, then pour it over pasta or rice along with the things I like to add to them (chicken, mushrooms, spinach, celery, garlic).  Some people add red pepper flakes to make it hotter, or garlic (I do sometimes), and many people add brown sugar to sweeten it up and make it more like a BBQ sauce.\n\nIt's getting really popular and there are lots of recipes on the Internet.",

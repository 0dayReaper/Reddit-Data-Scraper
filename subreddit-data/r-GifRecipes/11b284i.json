Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil over high heat in a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Add the onion and jalape\u00f1os and cook for 2\u20133 minutes until they begin to char. Add the garlic, cut side down, for 1 minute until it begins to brown.\n2. Place the chicken on top and pour over 8\u201310 cups of water, enough to completely submerge the chicken. Season with a teaspoon or two of salt. It will cook down and become quite salty, so there is no need to go too heavy with it.\n3. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 1 hour. Check the broth occasionally and skim off any foam or scum that floats to the top.\n4. After 1 hour, remove the chicken from the pot and transfer it to a bowl.\n\n**Finish the broth and shred the chicken:**\n\n1. Turn the heat to medium or medium-high. You want it hot enough to maintain a rapid simmer but not boil vigorously. Simmer rapidly for 20 minutes.\n2. Strain the broth into a large bowl through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard solids.\n3. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred the meat from the bones and add it to the bowl of broth.\n4. Carefully wipe out the pot with a damp cloth and return the pot to the stovetop.\n\n**Prepare the soup:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil over medium-high heat in the pot. Add the diced onion and peppers and cook, occasionally stirring, for 5\u20137 minutes. Season lightly with salt.\n2. Melt the butter into the onion and peppers. Once bubbly, add the chili powder, cumin, cayenne powder, and paprika. Toss to coat and sizzle the spices in the butter for about 1 minute.\n3. Pour in the reserved broth and shredded chicken. Next, pour in the diced tomatoes, black beans, and enchilada sauce cans. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Taste and season to your preferences.\n\n**Finish the soup:**\n\n1. Stir in the softened cream cheese if using. Continue cooking until it\u2019s completely melted into the broth.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with your favorite toppings. Enjoy!",

You could totally do it in the instant pot as well. \n\nUsing a slow cooker, put 2-3 chicken breasts in 4 cups of chicken broth. You can add a can of diced tomatoes, corn, and/or beans too. Add chicken fajita seasoning packet or cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder and salt and pepper to your liking. Slow cook on high for 4 hours and shred the chicken when done. Add a large can of Old El Paso mild enchilada sauce. Put your favorite toppings like shredded cheese, sour cream, jalape\u00f1os, crushed tortilla chips and fresh cilantro. It\u2019s nice because you can tailor it to how you like it! A lot of times, I would just cook the chicken with the diced tomatoes and chicken broth and that\u2019s what I used for my chicken tacos.

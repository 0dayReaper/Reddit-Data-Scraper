Microwaves do **not** heat evenly, and some materials more readily absorb the microwaves than others--hence why you'll sometimes have that one plate that gets too hot to touch despite the food on top still being frozen, for example.\n\nWater is a great absorber of microwaves, though. If you heat constantly for a minute, the water boils away while other parts barely get heated. Hence dry, tough food comes out. By cycling the emitter on and off, the heat absorbed by the food has time to spread to colder portions. This results in a more evenly-heated end result without as much water lost.\n\nFor what it's worth, this is also why almost all products designed to be microwaved say to let it sit for a certain time after taking it out--it's to let the heat spread.",

Oil and water do not mix, and most of the marinade is oil, and the fish itself (and all protein) is basically a water bag. Oil will not penetrate and will in all probability not even stick to the surface\n\nRather than including it in the marinade, I would drizzle the fish with oil (both sides) before baking.\n\nSecond: that is too much balsamic vinegar. Fish is going to be especially susceptible to acidic denaturing of proteins, so I would reduce the amount of balsamic to around 1/8th the total volume of ingredients.\n\nThird: as others have stated, a plastic bag would be best for marinading as it would drastically reduce the volume required for coating.",

Here in Italy, at least, you never really cook with balsamic vinegar. Rather it's a condiment (for lack of a better word) that you apply in small doses to finished food as you eat it. Cooking it destroys most of the flavor without adding anything innate to the finished product that you couldn't have achieved by seasoning with it after the fact.\n\nI guess I understand that the international trend of literally cooking with balsamic vinegar stems from the modern phenomenon of industrialized production of super market \"IGP\" balsamic vinegar that's aged for like five minutes, costs a euro per liter, and looks like black coffee. That's the only way anyone could afford to pour 1/2 cup of it in a pan, soak some fish in it, and burn it all off. But real balsamic vinegar is thick like cream and brown like chocolate, with rich and complex flavors that linger on your tongue for minutes and are so worth savoring on their own on a teaspoon or over this morning's ricotta that you'd never dream of mixing them in with a bunch of soy sauce and oil and boiling it away with your soon-to-be leftover salmon filet.

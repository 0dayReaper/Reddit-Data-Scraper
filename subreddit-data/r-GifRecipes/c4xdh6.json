Fake cheese, shoe polish on burgers, mashed potatoes instead of ice cream, these are all illegal according to FTA laws.\n\n\nedit: Flying Food: https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/flying-food/\n\nIt is used in today's practices of commercial making. \n\nFTC laws state that whatever you\u2019re selling with a photo must be real in the image. Selling corn flakes? The corn flakes have to be real. Apparently digging in deeper the milk can be fake because you aren't selling the milk, but for burgers for example there is a common practice to use shoe polish for the beef but that can not be done anymore since you are selling the burger as a whole.",

Maybe the restaurant has a type of ranch that tastes different than a lot of the stuff people are used to. Especially if they called it a garlic sauce, garlic will make ranch taste way better on pizza, since garlic is already a good addition to a pizza on its own. Even other flavors of ranch tend to taste way different, especially when combined with everything else on the pizza. This is a very long winded way of saying that people probably don\u2019t notice, and it tastes good enough that no one complains. \n\n\n\nOr I\u2019ve thought about this too hard and it\u2019s just not that deep.",

Most restaurants just use the powdered hidden valley that you can buy right next to the bottled. You mix it with either mayo, sour cream, or both. It's SO much better that I don't really like bottled anymore. Restaurants have a secret ratio, mix it with different or extra things, or make it from scratch. Seriously, buy a box of it once. It has directions on the package and is as easy as stirring a pouch with a cup of mayo.\n\n*Edit to add that restaurants use mayo and milk. Thank you for the information u/Royalhghnss",

And since people usually want at least half a pizza, sometimes even a full pizza, you're looking at making several pizzas at a minimum.\n\nBut with this recipe you can make tons of cones in like 1 hour,. They won't taste as good for sure, but it's way way less work and the gratitude of your friends for making it is pretty much the same as if you made good pizza.\n\nI personally wouldn't do any of this shit and would just order from a pizza place.",

On a deep level. But then, one fateful day, I met Alma. \n\nAlma runs a taco truck, close to my work. The majority of her customers are landscapers and day laborers that line up for her tacos at 6 in the morning. Her truck is not big, or especially popular. If I said that she served the best tacos in Austin, somebody would be able to prove me wrong tomorrow. But she puts effort into her work and she loves it. She takes great pains to improve her art, day after day and it comes through in her food. And she makes her own corn tortillas every damn day. The difference is unimaginable. The closest example I can find for tortillas that have been bought from a store or supplier is that it is like handing someone a stale loaf of Ms. Bairds white bread and telling them that\u2019s what bread tastes like. It\u2019s a real tragedy that so many have been prejudiced against corn tortillas by the cruel circumstances of fate. \n\nDo yourself a favor, please. Find your Alma.",

There's just something I don't understand going on here.\n\nSo we're going to make 'pizza rolls' out of premade tortillas, premade 'pizza sauce', and what looks to be store bought toppings.  I don't have a problem with any of that.  Quick and easy gets it done.\n\nBut then, we're for some reason going to make what looks like a ranch dressing dipping sauce from scratch?  Why is that the spot where we're spending effort?  If I had my druthers, I'd make either the dough or the red sauce from scratch and squeeze the dip out of a bottle.  \n\nScratch made pizza dough is way better than a tortilla, though it is kind of difficult and time consuming to make.  Scratch made pizza sauce is way better than store bought, and is quite easy to make.  Not really any harder than this dip, to be honest.  Scratch made ranch sauce isn't really much better than store-bought, and often worse.\n\nSo why spend the effort in this particular way?",

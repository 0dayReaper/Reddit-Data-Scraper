It\u2019s from my fathers side passed down. You just boil the whole chicken, shred it and put it back then you make the dough with butter milk, flour, salt, and oil. (Grandmother changed it to oil for health reasons and we never learned a different way) roll out the dough and cut it up and drop it into boiling broth. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s so good. We also make corn bread but not sweet. Sometimes I don\u2019t put all the chicken in and make tacos from it the next day. Anyway, just thought it was interesting and haven\u2019t seen anyone else cook it like us.",

            "comment": "**Recipe here originally:** [**Chicken and Dumplings Recipe**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/chicken-and-dumplings-recipe/)**.**\n\nYou can also follow [**@triedandtruerecipes**](https://www.instagram.com/triedandtruerecipes/) **on instagram** for more recipes, movies, and all sorts of other nonsense.\n\nThis recipe did have some drama with it. I completely ruined the first batch of broth and the chicken because I cooked the absorbent pad with the bird. I'm still convinced it was erroneously added in the cavity or somewhere hard to see, but anyway, that's a story for another time..RIP first bird...but the second time around was absolute perfection! I'm so happy with how it turned out and I'll have enough chicken and dumpling soup to give to my neighbor :)\n\nThe broth/soup follows my standard approach to cooking chicken soup. If you don't want to go through the rigamarole of simmering a whole chicken, you can use a store-bought rotisserie and save yourself a LOT of time.\n\nIf using a rotisserie, just pick all the meat from the bird. Use 8 cups of homemade or store-bought chicken stock to start. Add up to 1\u20132 cups more as needed if the soup is too thick.\n\nI combined a few techniques for the dumplings and made some modifications based off suggestions from my dad's memory of his mom's dumplings :-)\n\nPrep Time: 30 minutes\n\nCook Time: 1 hour 15 minutes\n\nInactive time: 2 hours 50 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 4 hours 35 minutes\n\nServings: 8\n\nCalories: 745kcal\n\n**Equipment**\n\n* Large pot\n* Fine mesh sieve\n* Whisk\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n**Chicken broth:**\n\n* 4-pound chicken, giblets reserved for another use\n* 1 yellow onion, scrubbed and quartered (peels left on, if you like)\n* 1 bunch of carrots, tops cut off and rinsed, carrots scrubbed and cut into thirds\n* 1 head of garlic, halved crosswise\n* 4 ribs of celery, rinsed and cut into thirds\n* 3 bay leaves\n* 3 sprigs thyme\n* 12 cups water, plus more if needed\n* Salt\n\n**Chicken soup:**\n\n* 12 ounces baby bella mushrooms, scrubbed and sliced\n* 4 tablespoons butter\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 4 carrots, peeled and diced\n* 1 parsnip, peeled and diced\n* 3 ribs celery with leaves, finely chopped\n* \u00bd cup flour\n* \u00bd cup heavy cream\n* 8 ounces frozen peas\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* Minced chives, for serving\n\n**Dumplings:**\n\n* 1 cup flour\n* 3 tablespoons cold butter, cubed\n* 2 teaspoons baking powder\n* \u00bd teaspoon baking soda\n* \u00bd cup plus 2 tablespoons buttermilk\n* Salt and pepper\n\n**Prepare the chicken broth:**\n\n1. Place chicken in a large pot and cover with 12 cups water. Add onion, carrots, garlic, celery, bay leaves, and thyme. Add 1 teaspoon salt (you\u2019ll add more later). Ensure the chicken is covered with water. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n2. Carefully remove the chicken from the pot and transfer it to a large bowl.\n3. Turn the heat on the broth to medium. Allow it to rapid-simmer for 30 minutes so that it reduces further. The broth will be a very deep golden brown. You should be left with between 8\u201310 cups of broth.\n4. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve into a very large bowl. Discard solids.\n5. Shred the chicken from the carcass and place the meat in the bowl of broth (I do this to keep it moist.). Set aside.\n6. Carefully wash out the pot and return it to the stovetop.\n\n**Cook the soup aromatics:**\n\n1. Turn the heat on the pot to medium. Add the mushrooms and let them cook in the dry pot until they release their liquid, about 6\u20137 minutes. No need to fuss over them or stir them too frequently. Allow them to release their liquid and for that liquid to evaporate.\n2. Continue cooking until they begin to brown, an additional 3\u20134 minutes.\n3. Melt the butter into the mushrooms and cook for 2\u20133 minutes, occasionally stirring. They will begin turning golden brown.\n4. Add the diced onion, carrots, parsnip, and celery and toss to combine. Cook for 6\u20137 minutes, often stirring until they soften. Season all over with salt and pepper.\n\n**Simmer the soup:**\n\n1. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and toss to coat. Toast the flour for 1\u20132 minutes.\n2. Ladle 1 cup of the reserved broth from the bowl and whisk to incorporate. Continue adding 1\u20132 ladlefuls until most of the broth has been added. Pour in the remaining broth and the chicken.\n3. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes or until the soup is thickened. Taste and season to your preferences.\n\n**Make the dumplings:**\n\n1. Combine flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl. Add the cold butter and work it into the flour until it\u2019s crumbly. Season with a pinch of salt and a few cracks of pepper.\n2. Pour in the \u00bd cup buttermilk and stir to combine. It\u2019s okay if it becomes a little doughy or seems slightly dry.\n\n**Finish the soup:**\n\n1. Pour the heavy cream into the soup and add the frozen peas. Turn the heat to medium-low.\n\n**Cook the dumplings:**\n\n1. Before cooking the dumplings, stir 2 tablespoons more buttermilk into the dumpling mixture. It should feel relatively loose and still wet.\n2. Using a tablespoon, drop spoonfuls of the dumplings into the pot.\n3. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Test dumplings with a toothpick to make sure it comes out clean. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Ladle the soup and dumplings into bowls. Garnish with freshly minced chives. Enjoy!",

You can up the flavor profile with an extra step though.\n\nTry roasting the chicken ahead of time then using just the bones/Mir poux scraps to make the stock.\n\nThen you can add the chicken meat in at the end along with the dumplings. You'll get a much richer stock with roasted bones and juicier/more flavorful chicken.",

You can add in stuff like tomato paste, use different types of stocks, darken the roux to make gumbo, thin it down to make stew, use different fats/flours in the roux, just have fun experimenting.

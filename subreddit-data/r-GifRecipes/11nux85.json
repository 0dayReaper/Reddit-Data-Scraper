Malta subsequently became a British protectorate, becoming a de facto colony in 1813. This was confirmed by the Treaty of Paris a year later. The islands became an important naval base for the British, serving as the headquarters of the Mediterranean Fleet. Due to this, Malta was attacked by the Axis powers during World War II, and in 1942 the island was awarded the George Cross, which today appears on Malta's flag and coat of arms.\n\nClose enough...",

However, in Italy, the word is spelt 'maccheroni'. It is a generic term for different types of short, hollow pasta tubes many of which have other more specific names.\n\nThis is what I found on an Italian cooking website, and here when we say macaroni it doesn't necesarrily have to be elbow. Penne, rigatoni or any other tubular pasta is called macaroni. Probably because Malta is close to Italy we use the same terminology for things.",

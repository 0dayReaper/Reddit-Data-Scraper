Whatever was cheap and convenient, if you lived on a dairy, you probably used your own cream.  Two things seem to be consistent in all of the different Pasta Grannies that I've seen, that huge rolling pin, and everything looks so damn tasty!",

Almost every \u201cgrilled cheese\u201d sandwich i see on here has other items added to it. The fact that this subreddit is called \u201cgrilledcheese\u201d is nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have nothing against melts, I just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses. Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? It\u2019s called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019d call that but it\u2019s not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to wager I\u2019ve eaten more grilled cheeses in my 21 years than any of you had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread. But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled \u201cmelts\u201d because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. I\u2019m not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac &amp; cheese. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. Shit, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I\u2019ve seen post after post of peoples \u201cgrilled cheeses\u201d all over reddit and it\u2019s been driving me insane. The moment i saw this subreddit this morning I finally snapped. Hell, I may even start my own subreddit just because I know this one exists now. You god damn heretics. Respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into whatever you like and love it for it what it is. Or make your damn melt sandwich and call it for what it is. A melt.",

Like WW2 new. \n\nAs the story goes, American soldiers in WW2 had more food than Italian soldiers. A lot of what the Americans had was bacon and eggs. So, the Italians \"acquired\" these items from the Americans. But the Italians wanted pasta, so they had to work out how the fuck you make a pasta dish when all you've really got is pasta, bacon, eggs and cheese. In the spirit of arrangiarsi, carbonara was born. \n\n300 years old or not, Italians are anal about it and your point stands. People like to appropriate the name to generate clicks and karma. Fuck those people. \n\nCarbonara is a dish you can cook in 10 minutes doing it like this and that makes it an amazing midweek dinner. I'm actually not a huge fan of it, but my partner absolutely froths it so I make it fairly regularly. And when I make it, I go to the Italian butcher near me and I buy guanciale. Every time.",

This will require more stirring to avoid the pasta from sticking, but it's worth it imo.\n\nAfter decades of making this dish ~twice a month, I still find minor details to improve upon each time!\n\nGreat job, keep it up :)",

I don't like to get all cheffy but tossing is in my experience the single best way to get something like this to come together. Spatula mixing is just too slow to get this thin layer of sauce to cook evenly. \n\nAgain, this looks like a perfectly fine bowl of carbonara, I just don't like statements like 'this is the real deal' on an imperfectly executed very well-known dish.",

Ive just made something else that is similar (with eggs and grated cheese) and it has the same issue with grainy parts.\n\nSo do you think this due to grating the cheese? I first thought it was the eggs that had begun to cook, but that would be almost impossible since I add water to the pan and give it a minute or so before adding in the cream mix.\n\nSomeone in the comments said to get the mix and blend it, that should probably work to break up any bigger pieces of grated cheese.",

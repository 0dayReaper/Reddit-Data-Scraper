One friend had spent some time in a country that apparently enjoyed swimming in capsaicin, so she ordered a dish with full spice. They looked at her quite oddly, but she was adamant. \n\nWell, they brought out the food, and she loved it, eating away like it was nothing. She then challenged us to try some, so I did. At which point my sinuses exploded in what can only be described as a full facial evacuation. Luckily I had brought tissues and went through an entire pack of Kleenex mopping myself up. I'm not sure whether I got off better or worse than another guy at the table who instantly broke into a full head/neck/entire body sweat and lost 6 pounds in water weight instantly.\n\n10/10, though. \n\nAlso I have to ask, all this powdered garlic and onion - wouldn't it taste better with, well, the real thing? You're draining it off anyway...",

Do they actually train their workers to sling sour cream around the kitchen like some weird Willy Wonka freakshow sideroom?

Cook until all the water is gone and the beef is done steaming, and all that is left is beef and grease. Don't you dare drain that beef.

Do like double that amount of seasoning but also do it after draining the grease, and then add a little chicken broth and let it boil off. \n\nThis way it would probably be waaaay easier to roll, and taste better with the meat at least. For the chipotle sauce you could just do whatever sauce tastes good I guess, or make one with chipotle peppers and mayo blended together or something. I actually don't know exactly whats in the taco bell chipotle sauce but at my current job its basically just mayo, chipotle, lime juice, salt and pepper.\n\nSorry to make a super long post but honestly was kinda figuring this out as I go along cuz now I kinda wanna make my own",

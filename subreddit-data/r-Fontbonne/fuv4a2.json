    "postText": "It's registration season! In an attempt to not meme for once, I'd like to talk about courses that you've taken that you found particularly worthwhile or enriching. This thread is probably a week late but whatever. Onto my list:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Intro to Philosophy**\n\nEspecially if you can get it with Kevin Eiler. This class provided me with a lot of opportunity to tackle the big life issues that get drowned out a lot. How do we know the world exists? What is the meaning of life? What is Obama's last name? \n\nEiler is the dude. He'll talk about anything and everything and be interesting the whole time. He's also really good at that philosophy stuff so that's a bonus. Great guy outside of class as well.\n\n2.  **Java**\n\nThis one is aimed more at MCS students. If you get to a point where you can take Java, you've already been exposed to the radioactive wasteland that is C++. Come to Java. There are no pointers.",

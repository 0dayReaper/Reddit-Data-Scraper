            "comment": "Kind of late to the conversation but there are two dining options on campus: Ryan Dining Hall and then the Griffin Grill. Ryan is a buffet style where the Griffin Grill is stuff like burgers, chicken tenders, and fries. You can pay cash if you are a commuter and if you are a resident you use your ID to scan as it tracks how many meals you have ate for the week. As well on campus there is a Starbucks in the library that I believe sells some food but as a resident I just go there and get coffee once in a while.",

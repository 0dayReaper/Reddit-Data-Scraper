And don't get me started on the other options. I'm living out of the AB vending machines. Honestly DSAC is just too confusing, how do you even get up there, why is it so high, it's like that freaky level on Pac Man World 2 with all the skeletons and mud and you're in a maze with the talking tree, you can see another path five feet away but oh no, Pac Man can't jump that far even though you jump literally three times (3x) longer on every other level and you fall in the water and drown.  It's just the size of this place. I wish I went to a smaller college.",

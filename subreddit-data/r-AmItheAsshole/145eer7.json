They might only be saying it casually and not forcefully but even so... if I'm told \"why don't you go for a walk?\" Nope, not doing it.\n\nIt became more apparent since having my son who is now 2 years old. When his dad will tell him to eat his food or do something else and repeats it I will respond \"he won't do it now because you keep telling him\". It's as if I can identify with why he's not doing it and I understand that because he's been asked more than once now he absolutely won't do it whereas if his dad had just said it once and then shut up it would've been fine.",

Adding my out of the box thinking for understanding ODD: If the brain is sensing a demand is coming from an enemy, refusing to comply can be a defense mechanism. ODD can have a similar working as hayfever where instead of a physical pollen a energetic ask is seen by the brain as a threat and going in overdrive to expell it. Just imagening, sience isn't stating this (yet).",

I don't take the top plate but take the 2nd plate from the top (a friend who works at a casino taught me that).  When I get get back to my seat I use hand sanitizer, because the tongs and serving spoons were likely touched by disgusting people who went to the bathroom without washing their hands.  I also clean my utensils with hand sanitizer because I don't trust them to be washed properly.  Some people eat while on line which I believe is a health code violation.  I've called people out in front of others for taking food with their hands instead of tongs.  This buffet also uses cloth napkins, but I put them aside and get a bunch of paper towels from the restroom to use instead.  I started all that due to Covid but I'm going to keep doing it.",

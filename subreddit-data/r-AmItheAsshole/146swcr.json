    "postText": "My boyfriend and I were on a plane and there was a small family sitting close by. The kids were like young and the parents seemed pretty young as well.\n\nAs far as kids go, they were pretty well behaved. You could hear the older one talking and the younger one squealing happily from time to time but nothing irregular or bothersome. \n\nMy bf just has an issue with being woken up. He\u2019s very sensitive to sound and will wake up over anything, then get moody because of it. In this case, he hadn\u2019t slept because he was stressed about missing the flight and was trying to sleep on the plane.\n\nThe younger kid started making loud happy kid noises which woke my bf up. You could hear the parents go \u201cshh\u201d and the kid stopped after a couple seconds.\n\nThe damage was done, bf was up and bothered. He started getting mad at ME over everything. Like I said, he gets moody as hell. But I\u2019m not the one that woke him up. He took his anger out on me because obviously he can\u2019t do anything to the kid, it\u2019s not like he did anything wrong.\n\nBut I snapped after he told me to shut up. Like excuse me? I\u2019m your girlfriend not some random person. I called him a big baby and said that if he\u2019s so pissed off, go yell at the kid. \u201cRight you won\u2019t because you have no balls and would rather shit on me because ur a coward who knows he\u2019s being childish.\u201d \n\nHe stopped rolling his eyes at me and being downright rude after that, but it\u2019s been a couple days and he\u2019s acting like I did something terrible to him. He even said that I went too far and I know how he gets. Besides, apparently it wasn\u2019t that he can\u2019t yell at the kid, it\u2019s that he didn\u2019t want to. Yeah right. But I\u2019ll bite, AITA?",

Someone making their emotions YOUR problem sucks. Real bad. It\u2019s one thing to be upset at something you did and say \u201chey I\u2019m upset and want to talk about it.\u201d Just being a jerk and making it your problem? Absolutely not. \ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9 \n\nNTA but you will be if you don\u2019t have a serious talk about this and get outta there if he\u2019s not interested in hearing your side and ideally changing behavior.",

The kids were like young and the parents seemed pretty young as well.\n\nAs far as kids go, they were pretty well behaved. You could hear the older one talking and the younger one squealing happily from time to time but nothing irregular or bothersome. \n\nMy bf just has an issue with being woken up. He\u2019s very sensitive to sound and will wake up over anything, then get moody because of it. In this case, he hadn\u2019t slept because he was stressed about missing the flight and was trying to sleep on the plane.\n\nThe younger kid started making loud happy kid noises which woke my bf up. You could hear the parents go \u201cshh\u201d and the kid stopped after a couple seconds.\n\nThe damage was done, bf was up and bothered. He started getting mad at ME over everything. Like I said, he gets moody as hell. But I\u2019m not the one that woke him up. He took his anger out on me because obviously he can\u2019t do anything to the kid, it\u2019s not like he did anything wrong.\n\nBut I snapped after he told me to shut up. Like excuse me? I\u2019m your girlfriend not some random person. I called him a big baby and said that if he\u2019s so pissed off, go yell at the kid. \u201cRight you won\u2019t because you have no balls and would rather shit on me because ur a coward who knows he\u2019s being childish.\u201d \n\nHe stopped rolling his eyes at me and being downright rude after that, but it\u2019s been a couple days and he\u2019s acting like I did something terrible to him. He even said that I went too far and I know how he gets. Besides, apparently it wasn\u2019t that he can\u2019t yell at the kid, it\u2019s that he didn\u2019t want to. Yeah right. But I\u2019ll bite, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

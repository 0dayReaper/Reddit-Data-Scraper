    "postText": "I (F27) have been a teacher for two years in that school.\n\nThe school is divided and the middle school headmaster is supervised by the high school headmistress. \n\nLast June, this headmaster removed me from a key position as head teacher for a class, using a pretext.  (I needed to get along better with one particular person) but also told me he needed to give this particular position to a new applicant as a bargaining tool, so that she would come. This particular applicant is older than me but she is less qualified in terms of diplomas. \nBasically choosing me as I was young and easy to manipulate. He offered first to give me another head teacher position but for a lower level class, which pays less. \nThree days later he removed said offer and this year I was a teacher without any head teacher position. \n\nThis year, my headmaster organised a trip with students in our language department and I participated in the reunion and planned the daily activities. But two males teachers, who aren\u2019t language professors, wanted to come and he couldn\u2019t choose between the two, so he suddenly had to meet with me and found complaints from colleagues (no source. Vague and outright lie for one of the complaints) to remove me from the trip. \n\nNow, I just unofficially heard that he wants to remove me from one of my levels (the highest one) to put the substitute teacher, for whom I already lost my head teacher position. But I passed my certification as a teacher and she hasn\u2019t, so technically I outrank her. \n\nI feel like, because I am young, I get walked all over and he has all the decision power. But I am tired of being pushed aside and I want to complain to his boss, to stop what I feel is harassment. \n\nI don\u2019t trust him at all and my HR representative is letting him walk all over me, because she tells me I have to be \u201ccorporate\u201d and I understand that it\u2019s for the good of the school \u2026.. (ie : offering the head teacher position allowed the new substitute teacher to accept the job and not go elsewhere) \n\nWhat should I do ? \nI feel like each year I lose the valuable parts of my job to this teacher. \n\nNote : in our last \u201cmeeting\u201d he basically told me that I couldn\u2019t complain to my colleagues and that the idea that certified teachers are better than non certified is a lie \nWhich isn\u2019t true in terms of legal status \u2026..",

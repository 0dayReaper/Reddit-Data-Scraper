    "postText": "Before I start, I need to say a short warning that this is my first Reddit post and so my format may not be that good. I also don\u2019t use grammar on a daily basis, so I apologize if I make any mistakes.\n\nContext: I (17f) am in a friend group with 3 other people. I won\u2019t use their real names, so they will be known as Jane, Jill, and Jocelyne. We are all around the same age, Jocelyne being the oldest and a year older than the rest of us. Jill is the most athletic in our group, and normally jokes around, tackling us and basically doing stuff like throwing grass at us and hitting us pretty hard in the back. I am mostly targeted for this, and I\u2019ve learned to get used to it even though I don\u2019t like it. I am also the most sensitive in the group, so that will probably make the story make more sense. \n\nMoving on to the actual story, we as a group decided to hang out over the summer, and the first thing we did was to get ice cream. That part was normal, nothing out of the ordinary happening. We decided to take our ice cream and walk to the park, which was only a few blocks away. As we get there, we see 3 other people we know from school, all hanging out. One of them has a water g\u00fbn, and when they see us, they start running after us. All fun and games, right? That is, until the one with the water g\u00fbn shoots me in the back with it when I\u2019m not looking. By this point, I just want to go home. As I\u2019m wiping my face, trying to hide the fact that I\u2019m crying, I hear Jill say \u201cI\u2019ll pay you 5 bucks to shoot her again.\u201d Before I have time to block it, she shoots me in the face with the water g\u00fbn. Jill scrambles to get her money and says \u201cI only have a 10,\u201d implying that she would give the whole thing if the girl with the water g\u00fbn shot me a third time. So the third time, the water hits my side. At this point, I\u2019m crying and passing it off as the water dripping from my hair. Jill is the most satisfied of the 4 of us, saying it was so funny as we leave. The others in the group decide to go to target, which at this point, I wasn\u2019t so willing to go with them but went anyway because I didn\u2019t want to be left out. Keep in mind, I am the only one who was shot by the water g\u00fbn. So we go to target, buy some stuff, and leave. \n\nThis all made a big impact on me, considering that I really thought these were the people I would die with. I also felt hurt by the fact that the other people in our group (Jill and Jocelyne) did nothing in my defense and also passes it off as a joke. We originally were planning to hang out again around my birthday, also in the summer, which is coming up, but now, I don\u2019t really want to go with them. My other friends that don\u2019t go to the same school as me and I haven\u2019t seen in months are inviting me to hang out also around my birthday, and I really would rather go. \n\nSo am I the asshole for dropping my plans with my other group because of what happened?",

They keep you around to amuse themselves with shit like this. They\u2019re bullies. \n\nBut also, it\u2019s kind of funny that your friend spent literal money on this. With that said, she did that because she knew it\u2019d bother you, and it was worth $$$ for her to see it happen. And then, you *still went with them to Target.* Let them know you won\u2019t put up with it in the future\u2014going to Target with them after all that certainly showed them that it bothered you, but not enough to make you tell them to fuck off. They know they can do this shit with no repercussion, so they\u2019ll keep doing it. You teach people how to treat you, and you\u2019re teaching them that you\u2019ll endure it. What if it escalates when they try to see how much more you\u2019ll put up with? If you let them, they\u2019ll test your limits, so don\u2019t let them. \n\nBut to the point, go out with your other friends\u2014you don\u2019t owe these \u201cfriends\u201d anything, and they don\u2019t deserve your friendship if they are willing to pay cash to see you get upset.

It's highly unlikely you will end up friends with these kids after high school. Heck, my ride or die bestie from that time lives 5 minutes from me and I have seen her once at the grocery store. Life moves on and you will be okay. \n\nIn the meantime, you have to learn to advocate for yourself. Truthfully, I was you in high school, and until I stood up for myself,  that stuff happened. After I stopped allowing it to happen there was some blowback, but those same people came back around because they also liked me with a spine. \n\nSo do this... and it's cheesy but stick with me. Go stand in front of a mirror and practice what you should have said and a few more replies. Once you get over the weirdness of saying it, it gets easier. That being said,  you can also just walk away and not say anything.  Either one works,  but I wouldn't waste my time with these kids unless they apologize.",

They stopped but one of them came up behind me and tried pouring water down my back so I tripped him, jumped on his back, and put him in a rear naked choke then everyone else emptied their water all over him until he was completely drenched.

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nBefore I start, I need to say a short warning that this is my first Reddit post and so my format may not be that good. I also don\u2019t use grammar on a daily basis, so I apologize if I make any mistakes.\n\nContext: I (17f) am in a friend group with 3 other people. I won\u2019t use their real names, so they will be known as Jane, Jill, and Jocelyne. We are all around the same age, Jocelyne being the oldest and a year older than the rest of us. Jill is the most athletic in our group, and normally jokes around, tackling us and basically doing stuff like throwing grass at us and hitting us pretty hard in the back. I am mostly targeted for this, and I\u2019ve learned to get used to it even though I don\u2019t like it. I am also the most sensitive in the group, so that will probably make the story make more sense. \n\nMoving on to the actual story, we as a group decided to hang out over the summer, and the first thing we did was to get ice cream. That part was normal, nothing out of the ordinary happening. We decided to take our ice cream and walk to the park, which was only a few blocks away. As we get there, we see 3 other people we know from school, all hanging out. One of them has a water g\u00fbn, and when they see us, they start running after us. All fun and games, right? That is, until the one with the water g\u00fbn shoots me in the back with it when I\u2019m not looking. By this point, I just want to go home. As I\u2019m wiping my face, trying to hide the fact that I\u2019m crying, I hear Jill say \u201cI\u2019ll pay you 5 bucks to shoot her again.\u201d Before I have time to block it, she shoots me in the face with the water g\u00fbn. Jill scrambles to get her money and says \u201cI only have a 10,\u201d implying that she would give the whole thing if the girl with the water g\u00fbn shot me a third time. So the third time, the water hits my side. At this point, I\u2019m crying and passing it off as the water dripping from my hair. Jill is the most satisfied of the 4 of us, saying it was so funny as we leave. The others in the group decide to go to target, which at this point, I wasn\u2019t so willing to go with them but went anyway because I didn\u2019t want to be left out. Keep in mind, I am the only one who was shot by the water g\u00fbn. So we go to target, buy some stuff, and leave. \n\nThis all made a big impact on me, considering that I really thought these were the people I would die with. I also felt hurt by the fact that the other people in our group (Jill and Jocelyne) did nothing in my defense and also passes it off as a joke. We originally were planning to hang out again around my birthday, also in the summer, which is coming up, but now, I don\u2019t really want to go with them. My other friends that don\u2019t go to the same school as me and I haven\u2019t seen in months are inviting me to hang out also around my birthday, and I really would rather go. \n\nSo am I the asshole for dropping my plans with my other group because of what happened?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It may be worthwhile to discuss with Jill how you feel, although if it's not innocent behavior turned into a burdensome habit that may backfire. You also might want to talk to Jane or Jocelyne so that they know you don't like this and can stick up for you when you're too busy dealing with what's going on to take control of the situation. Choosing to spend some time with friends who you are more comfortable with is a good idea, and maybe spending time with people who respect you more will give you some new perspective to bring back to Jane, Jill, and Jocelyne.",

I feel for you - this sounds a lot like something I struggle with: I absolutely hate people throwing or aiming things at me, even as a game, even if it\u2019s soft, even if it\u2019s not going to hurt, even if they\u2019re someone I get along with most of the time. Hate. It.   \n\nNerf guns, water pistols, a tossed teddy bear, ball sports, a piece of crumpled paper - anything moving rapidly towards my face or head freaks me out. I can\u2019t help it - I flinch and get upset every time and I have for *years*. Decades even.   \n\nAny time I\u2019m in a situation where things are flying at my head, I get extremely angry and also extremely teary. I was told a lot growing up that I was sensitive (or \u201ctoo sensitive\u201d to be exact). And now I\u2019m in my 40s, you know what I\u2019ve realised?   \n\nFirstly: there is nothing wrong with \u201cbeing sensitive\u201d. You are allowed to set the standard of what is and is not acceptable treatment of you. That\u2019s your prerogative - people can disagree, mock you, be exasperated, call you a party pooper, call you high maintenance. Whatever. But you ARE ALLOWED to say what you will and won\u2019t put up with. Being sensitive is not a bad thing. And even if it were, you don\u2019t have a lot of control over it. You are who you are.  \n\nSecondly: when people say \u201cyou\u2019re so sensitive\u201d often this really means \u201cI don\u2019t like the fact I can\u2019t treat you however I want, with no repercussions. I don\u2019t like that I can\u2019t treat you like crap without you objecting.\u201d   \n\nKeep an eye out for these sort of people - they want to treat you that way because they are unhappy and hate it, and think they can feel better by making others feel worse. Those sorts of people are not good people to be around. You will keep meeting them in life, unfortunately. But you will learn fast how to spot them. Listen to your gut. Examine how people who make you feel gross treat you.   \n\nYou don\u2019t have to hide the fact you feel betrayed, upset, angry, hurt, tearful, confused or anything else, just to qualify as \u201cgood enough\u201d to hang out with people who are being cruel to you. You can and will get better friends who are as tender and gentle as you - human traits that are incredibly important and beautiful.\n\nSomething that might be of interest to you - I was recently diagnosed with autism. In my reading and research, I kept seeing a common theme: of women like me being described as \u201csensitive\u201d. I understand now that my brain translates a lot of unexpected and loud/fast stimuli as pain, and I am easily overwhelmed especially when things are happening quickly. Maybe this is something worth looking into for you.  \n\nDitch these girls. The price they are asking you to pay is not worth it. You don\u2019t have to be treated like crap just to have friends. It may take time to find others who\u2019ll treat you how you want - so in the mean time, be as good a friend to yourself as you can, OK? You\u2019re worth it.",

When I first met this group, I thought it was a match made in heaven. If you asked me to kill myself that same week I met them, you would see me with a knife 10 minutes later.

The other friends I actually still have are not in my area, making it hard to socialize with them and we mostly only talk over text.",

And while it does get better with time (honestly, it really does), the time you spend waiting for things to get better, and for you to meet people who click with you, it can be tiring and it can be frustrating to keep feeling like you don\u2019t fit.   \n\nI do want to give you one more thing to consider: you are the only person who has to live with you, for your whole life. You\u2019re the only one who will be there with you every step of the way.   \n\nFriends come and go, parents pass away, loved ones come in and out of your life. You\u2019re the only one who has to live with you and be with you the whole time. People may not treat you well: that doesn\u2019t mean you deserve mistreatment. \n\nSo please, if you can, be the best friend to yourself you can be. Treat yourself with gentleness. Hug yourself. Give yourself comfort, gifts, kindnesses, treats, support, tell yourself you\u2019re rad. Tell yourself you\u2019re worth being treated well. Because you are, that is an absolute truth.",

Sure, it was just water but they took it beyond that and made it very personal. Jill literally paid another person to spray you in the face in an attempt to humiliate you. How is that funny? I don't get the joke. \nReal friends don't make \"jokes\" that they know will hurt you, and then continue to make those \"jokes\" once you've told them how you feel. This is true for any and all jokes, whether those \"jokes\" be physical or verbal. Real friends don't go out of their way to spend their time, money, and energy to humiliate you. When someone cares about you they want to do things that make you feel good, not bring you tears. I really want you to think about all of your time together and how much of that time is spent with you feeling uncomfortable in some way when you're all together, or crying because of something that they said or did to you? Maybe I'm way off base here, but if I'm not I would consider taking some time away from this specific group of friends and hang out with some other people instead.\n\nEdit: NTA",

You\u2019re being bullied, and you\u2019re reacting reasonably. \u2018Sensitive\u2019 is a word that people use to minimise their own actions, and dismiss your feelings. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t just not nice behaviour. This was nasty, cruel, mean girl behaviour. These girls are actively, physically hurting you for their own amusement. Make no mistake, they knew you were upset. They straight up didn\u2019t care. I\u2019d wager that had they known you were crying, they\u2019d have made fun of you for that, too. \n\nThese girls aren\u2019t your friends. You don\u2019t owe them anything, let alone your time. Go see your other friends, and don\u2019t give it a second thought. If this group asks about your plans, I\u2019d be honest with them. You no longer feel safe spending time with them, as they derive joy from causing you pain. When they tell you you\u2019re just being sensitive, tell them \u2018gee thanks for validating my emotions\u2019 and end the conversation. You deserve to have fun, be a kid, and feel safe, and you\u2019re not going to get that with Jill, Jane and Jocelyn. \n\nNTA.",

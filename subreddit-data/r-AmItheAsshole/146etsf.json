            "comment": "There's an obvious answer to this dilemma. Your FIL is providing a nice home so your 9 year old son is in a safe and clean environment. A 9 year old is capable of understanding reciprocity. Why do you think he should only have to clean when he makes a mess? Isn't it more appropriate to explain that helping to clean is a gesture of appreciation for the kindness FIL has shown letting you and your son live/stay there? \n\nYTA and not just for disrespecting your FIL in his own house. You have also let your son down for not giving him the opportunity to learn that it's best to pay kindness with kindness.",

If I was OP's ex/the mother of the kid I'd be *pissed* if he let some overbearing jerk *force* my child to clean his house 10 mins after he walked through the door and would be insisting that he visit the kid at home until his living situation is more sorted. It's not like he asked nicely, no, he *demanded* and ranted about the kid even being in his house without free labor, again, *immediately* after his arrival. Even if OP and his gf aren't paying rent to stay there this would be over-the-top, but if they *are* it's just even more egregious. You don't *order* other people's kids to do free labor for you, period, and you especially don't berate the parent in front of them for refusing to let you bully their kid. OP is not only NTA but his gf's dad is enough of an asshole that he should really be reconsidering whether or not to stay in this relationship and already looking for a safer place for him and his kid. \n\nLetting someone stay with you DOES NOT give you permission to treat them *and their child* (who's only there on weekends) like slaves whose labor you're 100% entitled to regardless of how they feel about that. OP was fine with following the dad's house rules for himself and had every right to say his kid IS NOT included in that deal.",

I\u2019m doing the things I *never got to do as a child* thanks to my parents and older (weaponized incompetence) brother. I collect toys I like. I watch the movies I want, TV shows I want, wear the clothes I like. I dyed my hair a very bright purple this weekend for shits n giggles. \n\nYou missed out on important parts of your childhood by being forced to take care of others. I was kind of in the same boat; my parents owned their own business, were always too busy/too tired to cook, clean, do the dishes, you name it. As soon as I could reach the sink I was taught to do dishes. As soon as I could reach the laundry in the top loading machine to get it out, I was taught t do laundry. I was responsible for looking after 2 adults, my older brother and 2-3 guys who worked for us all summer. Then during th rest of the year, it stayed that way because my parents needed time off from having to make a year\u2019s wages in a limited time in a seasonal biz. \n\nSo now? I enjoy my childhood as an adult. If I want a fast food lunch, I\u2019ll indulge occasionally. If I want the happy meal toy, I\u2019ll buy it separately. If there\u2019s a lego set or something I want, I\u2019ll get that and play with it. YA books? I read \u2018em like crack since most adult books are either the same kind of mysteries, or trashy bodice ripping romances with recycles plots. Do my friends poke gently fun at me? Yup! Does my husband fondly roll his eyes at me when I babble about the latest comic book I\u2019ve read? Also yup.\n\nDo I give a fuck? *Nope!* Allowing to love what I love, unashamedly, has gone a long way towards learning to take care of myself. I\u2019m helping heal that lost, sad, abused child by giving myself a childhood now - while being an actual adult who does adult things, too. \n\nGive yourself the freedom to indulge (as time, interest and finances permit) in things you would have as a kid. Try starting with something simple, like a coloring book. Then branch out if you find it helpful. There\u2019s a whole world of fun waiting for you! Much love from one \u2018adult kid\u2019 to another. \n\nPS: I was a Universal Studios and a woman who had to be 70 if she was a day was wearing her robes, had a wand and was giggling and thrilled whenever she got the \u2018magic\u2019 to work with her wand. She was absolutely giddy with delight and I loved it. I didn\u2019t have robes (too tough with a wheelchair) but I got my wand and was having the same reaction when I got things to work. There\u2019s no age limit on youth or the fun you can have.",

Being made to clean up all of the mess of a family is incredibly frustrating, especially as a kid who wouldn't have contributed to it. Children should not be considered free labor at any point in their life by anyone, and if a kid is doing chores it should be their choice to do so, but people need to know how to clean things and how to be responsible and those are much easier lessons to learn as a kid.\nOP said FIL is very fastidious, so I'm assuming the Saturday cleaning is likely just sweeping/vacuuming, laundry, any necessary dusting. Fastidious people don't usually put off doing all the dishes and picking up because it's way easier to keep a place clean if you're constantly cleaning.",

It wasn't any human's mess but the tree. Do we expect the tree to clean up after itself? That's unhinged.\n\nIf people employ the mindset you have, then no one will clean communal areas, like a backyard, garden, or even an unused swimming pool.",

But beyond that I clean MY HOUSE. I care for MY things. I don't force my kid to scrub floors and fold mountains of my laundry. They fold their own. They put away their own. But I wanted this house. I chose these things not them.... Why should they be forced to clean and care for anything they did not help create. That includes yard work. Being forced to wake up at 6am every Saturday morning to go pull hard ass weeds in flower beds I had no fucking say in until I was absolutely miserable and exhausted under the Texas heat will forever be something I resent my dad for. I wasn't born to be his servant. \n\nI dunno.. maybe that's just how I see it. My kids know how to clean but I don't make them clean anything they didn't make a mess of. So yes they've been shown how to clean their bathrooms. And do dishes and do laundry once age appropriate. But beyond that... That MY job.",

Absolutely not.\n\nNTA, and I hope yall don't have kids because \"kids are property and therefore servants\" is such an unhinged take.",

Definitely think in the future he should participate as the upkeep will be in the place he is living- but he hasn\u2019t been living there and I don\u2019t think this teaches the son anything on his first day in a house except to dislike his grandfather who didn\u2019t even allow him any time or space to adjust before cleaning things he\u2019s never seen before. Never moved into an apartment and immediately had to clean up for the people who left, never stayed with a friend on a trip and immediately cleaned upon arrival.

Not you. Not my wife. Just me. If you don't like that, kick me out.'_\n\nAs per OP's comments, it sounds like he just needs to move out instead of daring the FIL to kick him out. If he doesn't need the free housing, then keep it moving to a more comfortable environment..... OP says it will be 3 weeks before their house closes, so for his family's sake I hope that everything goes according to plan and there are no delays.",

You're the parents, so that decision should be entirely up to you. If you say \"We'll take care of X, our son doesn't need to do it\" then that should be that.\n\nYour FIL's fixation on dictating your son's behavior is deranged, his house or not.

Cleaning is not bonding time.\n\nIn the future, yes, child can and should participate for actually living in the home, but 9-year olds aren\u2019t just free labor for the sake of teaching responsibility and to enforce this shit on that first day without having a convo about it first is controlling and FIL is acting like a tyrant in this instance.

You know, after the 9yo has settled and actually contributed to the mess. \n\nIf I let a friend stay with me for 3 weeks while they were waiting on the paperwork for thier place to finalize and they happened to arrive on my cleaning day, it would be the biggest AH move for me to insist they help clean the house. Guests are never expected to clean up after me in my house or do chores, unless they stay long enough to do them, or they make a mess that requires a lot of effort to clean. If you wouldn't do it to an adult friend, then it shouldn't be expected of a 9yo child either.\n\nThe kid can help next cleaning day, after he has settled and actually contributed to the mess. So many people here are missing the part where this is a split custody arrangement, which already puts a ton of stress on the child who is FORCED to switch houses and routines. It's gross to think that adults are demanding this child be put to work immediately. FIL demanding access to child labor is reprehensible. He isn't the parent, and shouldn't be trying to take OPs place as dad to the 9yo.",

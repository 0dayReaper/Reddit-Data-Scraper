Thankfully my MIL never speaks of \u201cprevious wife\u201d considering it ended badly anyways, but if I heard comments like that I\u2019d pissed, and I know for sure my husband would blow up on them too. It\u2019s not about technicality, but the lack of respect in their tone. They don\u2019t have to agree with OPs previous choices, that\u2019s his life to live the way he wants, not theirs. Families trying to enforce their beliefs onto the younger generation is so god damn stupid and should be kept at an arms length, or just far the hell away. And if they\u2019re going to be technical, assuming your parents/family members are past 65, I\u2019d call them \u201cUncle/Aunt \u2014\u2014, the senior citizen\u201d. It\u2019s technically true right? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Someone who seriously views marriage as something important and meaningful and lifelong is going to disapprove of him sweeping his paper marriage under the rug and acting like he has a first wife. They should keep their disapproval to their fucking selves, 100%, but I can\u2019t blame them for disapproving it.",

These are comments meant to drive home their disapproval of the first marriage and are meant to be cutting while the family can fall back on them being \"jokes\".\n\nThat is what I meant behind this being what tipped OP into being NTA for me. While he cannot just hide from his previous decisions and act like this is his first marriage, I understand why he blew up at them and feel it is an appropriate escalation since they are being malicious and disingenuous.",

There were a few other things too, like how they kept setting up potential arranged marriages for her or threatening to take her home to their country. There was also a time when they threatened to have her committed to a mental health facility. \n\nAt the time, she was also really reluctant on letting me help her beyond minor things because she felt like it was something she had to repay.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo for context here, my (27f) friends (24f and 25m) have been staying in mine and my bfs (32m) basement since October 2022. They wanted to move to our city and we agreed that we would help them out till they found a place on the condition they helped with chores, kept the basement space clean, and did a bit of cooking etc.\n\nMy friend (24f) who well call Lucy, offered to do all of the cooking because she liked cooking and felt bad that they weren\u2019t paying for anything. I agreed as I worked late most nights. Her husband (25m) who I\u2019ll call Carl, had a job with my boyfriend but quit with no notice after having to scrape gum off the floor one day. He hasn\u2019t had a job since and Lucy doesn\u2019t see a problem with this. She works at a coffee shop as a supervisor and I allowed her to borrow my car some days and others I would drop her off and pick her up. She was planning on going to get her car at her parents and driving the 3000k back with it so she\u2019d stop using mine. This was 6months ago.\n\nNeedless to say I was already upset with the situation but to make matters worse the basement was a complete disaster and Lucy had started getting upset with me for not doing the groceries or cooking despite her pretty constantly having my car and offering to do the cooking, even though I offered to give her a break and cook many times. (Photos in link bellow) I\u2019ve asked nicely for them to clean up a million times but they just don\u2019t seem to care, I snapped and told them they were disgusting disrespectful children and that I want things cleaned up immediately. I said all the friends they were calling toxic all the time must\u2019ve just got fed up with their bullshit because in my experience they were the toxic ones and treating me and my home like shit. Lucy\u2019s response was that I had taken advantage of her and that I treated her like shit, and while I\u2019m sure some of the times I got upset with her I might\u2019ve been a bitch, I feel like I\u2019m justified in this.\n\nAITA?\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/BNPb8m5 (link of photos)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "comment": "NTA with a huge BUT. If you \u201cacted like a bitch\u201d then it isn\u2019t justified. Just because you\u2019re helping someone doesn\u2019t allow you to treat them worse than you\u2019d do if you weren\u2019t. It\u2019s a recipe for disaster. You cannot expect people to tolerate you taking out your frustration on them out of gratitude.   \n\n\nWith that being said, what you **should** (or should have) done was to set out a clear boundary. E.g. sit your friend down and say \u201cThis is what the basement looks like and it cannot continue like that. I\u2019m expecting it to by cleaned by X date. I also expect you to maintain hygienic living conditions there. If not, I\u2019m expecting you to find your own place and move by Y time.\u201c No ifs, no buts, no emotional trips, just facts. The situation sucks for all parties involved and I\u2019m sure the frustration has taken toll on you. Since the husband doesn\u2019t work, my guess is that it exacerbates any tensions and frustrations of that friend of yours. That\u2019s why I think sticking to facts may help. \n\nI think the same can be done about the car. I think she probably has trouble taking enough TO to go and get it. The husband doesn\u2019t work. He can fetch it. You need your car. So \u201cI need my car, you need your car, and in order to do grocery shopping, I need my car too. While I appreciate you need to get around and that\u2019s why I offered my car for  you to use it, I think the situation became tricky. Since we are both too busy, my suggestion is that you get your husband to bring the car by this and this deadline.\u201c \n\nI know it\u2019s easy to me to say from some distance apart, but perhaps lack of emotional investment in this situation allows me to see a way out. Good luck, and if it doesn\u2019t work, don\u2019t be afraid to kick them out. That would not make you an asshole.",

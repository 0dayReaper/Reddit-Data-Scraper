    "postText": "I call my kids Boy (15) and Girl (16). I love the Simpsons and I always thought it was funny that Homer referred to Bart as Boy and Bart called him Homer.  With my father everything was yes sir no sir. \n\nI also constantly tell my kids that I love them and am proud of them. \n\nFor some reason the name thing puts a wild hair up my dad's ass. \n\nHe was over last weekend and he was vociferous about how I'm hurting his grandchildren by not calling them by their names. I told him that my kids were happy and to leave it alone.  \n\nHe just wouldn't drop it. So I called my kids over to where we were talking and I asked them if they wanted to be called by their names instead of Boy and Girl. \n\nI said in return they would have to call me Sir not daddy or dad. I said I would accept Father in emotional conversations. But that I would no longer remind them every day that I loved them and was proud of them. \n\nThey both did they were happy with the status quo. They know what my relationship with my father is like. \n\nMy father got all pissed off and said that's not what he wanted at all. So I asked him how often he told my sisters and I he loved us or was proud of our accomplishments or just as people. \n\nHe said it was a different time. That his father was worse than him. So I asked him if he thought my kids were happier than myself and my sisters were growing up.  I pointed out that my kids are happy. They are reasonably well adjusted.\n\nNow he is being pissy and my mom says he is upset that I think he was a bad father. \n\nHe wasn't. He was just emotionally distant. I hated it. My sisters both had some therapy to help them choose better men. They both \"fell in love\" with any guy who gave them attention. My daughter knows her worth and won't settle for anything but the best. My son has no problem hugging me and telling me or his mom about his life. \n\nThey are teens, I know I don't know everything going on with them. But I'm doing my best to be there and give them the support I never had.\n\nMy kids know they are loved. I don't just say it. I try my best to show it. \n\nMy dad thinks I'm being an asshole for pointing out where he didn't do great as a father when he tried to criticize my parenting.",

Where you might be in dicey territory is the parenting choice of using your children as props, and threatening, even in jest, to withhold affection. It sounds like you have a healthy parental bond, and your kids are old enough and know you weren\u2019t serious. But if they had any ambiguity about that, then you\u2019d be an AH for causing it just to illustrate a point to your father.",

                                    "comment": "At that age, I would've understood the sarcasm...but it would've still hurt. And then I would've felt like an idiot for feeling hurt because it's 'just sarcasm, I shouldn't be taking it so seriously', and then I would've spiraled into self hate for being such a literal idiot who can't take a joke, while still feeling hurt over the comment. I just think not loving your kids isn't something you should joke about.\n\nTo be fair, I do have a laundry list of diagnoses, anxiety, depression, autism, ADHD ...but I didn't get diagnosed until I was an adult. If you've never taken kids to be evaluated, you don't know they don't have one of those. Especially anxiety and depression, which are on the rise in young people.\n\nAnxiety and depression are silver tongued liars, and a comment like 'If I start calling you by your name, I'll stop loving you', even if sarcastic, would give them the perfect fodder to torment me at night. Because they wouldn't let go of the 'what if'. What if it wasn't sarcasm? What if he meant it?\n\nAnd what if one or both of the kids *did* want to be called by their names and not 'Boy' or 'Girl'? I can guarantee you, they now feel like they can't bring that up. My family is a deeply sarcastic one, and I used to not see a problem with it, but now I have trouble talking about my emotions because of various comments made over the years.\n\nYeah, I'm definitely projecting, but I mostly just wish my dad had checked in even once after a comment like that. And he does tell me he loves me lots, just sometimes those comments hurt. So it might be worth for OP to check in, just in case, you never know what's happening in someone's head. Better to make sure and find out it really is nothing, then to have something much worse brewing under the surface.",

I get not everyone likes kids,but really? Its unhinged. Kids are capable of learning stuff, most can communicate with adults and understand social things. They also can pick up on negative stuff towards them pretty easily,so this is hurting them. OP's kids knew he wasnt really hurting them,but trying to send his father a message,and these kids are 15 and 16. We let 16 yr olds get jobs and drive cars,and they're expected to be thinking about their future when they're adults and what career they will choose. These arent easy things.",

But I hope you have a private conversation where you let them know that if they ever do seriously want you to call them by their names, you would of course do it and not make them change how they address you or love them less. I\u2019m sure they probably already know, but I think it\u2019s worth covering your bases and make sure they know you said that as a joke to your dad, not as an actual rule you\u2019d follow.",

I think OP definitely needs to spell this out clearly for his kids in private (\"You probably already know this, but I want to say it just in case...\").  \n\nDad just very clearly told them that he'll only use their names if they call him Sir and accept that he won't say he loves them.  If that's not actually true, he really should touch base and make sure they understand that.  The fact that they \"understand his relationship with his father\" won't necessarily lead them to the right assumption (and they might not understand the relationship as well as he thinks).",

But its totally fine to do it to kids because they both dont know better and cant stand up for themselves yet.",

            "comment": "YTA. Calling your kids boy and girl seems really dehumanizing. If you had just asked them, with no caveats, if they liked it and they said yes that would be different. But this reads as if you knew they would say they didn't like ot so you manipulated them by threatening to withhold love and praise if they don't allow it. This is still emotional abuse and manipulation just in a different way your father did it. If I were you first step would be to apologize to your kids amd ask them privately if they really are ok with the names and that you'd treat them the same regardless. Being better isn't just saying words of affirmation, its seeing them as humans, their own people, amd letting them know you acknowledge them as such.\nAs far as the thing with your dad goes, sounds like you may need some therapy to process that. Which isn't a bad thing. It's a tool to help. I wouldn't really call you an AH for calling him out in this case, but don't ever use your children in arguments for your benefit. Especially in a way that manipulates and gaslights them. That must have been incredibly uncomfortable for both of them, at an age where they know what's going on.",

You're the one who used it as a chance to rehash old childhood wounds and humiliate your father in front of his grandchildren.\n\nKudos to you for wanting to be a better father to your children than the one you had growing up, but your Dad is right -- those were very different times.  I feel bad for men back then -- everything was on their shoulders (being the Breadwinner, being the Man of the House, being a strong Father as was defined by the times) but they weren't allowed to show or even have any emotions about it.\n\nMy father never told us he loved us when we were growing up -- that simply wasn't done back then.  I don't remember any hugs, either.  And he DID call my brother \"Boy.\"  (My Dad was from the South).\n\nI got some therapy as I got older and worked through my feelings and resentments and learned to accept my Dad for who he WAS as opposed to who I wanted him to be.  I began telling my Dad, \"I love you\" at the end of every phone call and often when we were together.  At first he didn't respond, but over time he started saying, \"I love you, too.\"  Eventually he started saying it spontaneously!\n\nThen as he got older he softened.  I began spending more time with him, and we created a whole new relationship, letting go of the past and enjoying each other's company as equals.  Then he got cancer, and I spent more time with him while I could, and we grew even closer.\n\nHe died four years ago and I still miss him every day.  I will NEVER regret the time I spent with him or the effort I put into building a relationship with him as an adult, because I reaped the rewards of *finally* having the type of loving relationship with my father that I had sought all my life.  It took love, communication, patience and boundary setting, but I'm so glad we were able to navigate it and thus became closer than I ever could have imagined.\n\nMy point is, if you view your father with Compassion, if you speak to him from Love, you can still have a better relationship with your Dad -- It's not too late!\n\nOR you can continue to hold your past against him and keep that distance and remain at an emotional impasse until he dies and the rest of your life is filled with resentments and regret.\n\nThe Choice is Yours.",

He probably felt embarrassed by you roping your kids into it to make a point. Not saying he wasn\u2019t distant and that didn\u2019t affect you, but he has a story too and you can only find that out by speaking to him.",

But I do see his perspective - calling your children \"Boy\" and \"Girl\" seems to be a fun joke between you and your kids, but I can see how without the context it could seem odd or hateful. Maybe it also reminds him of something he's also seen growing up - this is pure speculation of course, but you did mention his own father was supposedly worse than him. And I'm sorry but telling your children you won't say you love them unless they let you call them \"Boy\" or \"Girl\" is a horrible thing to say, even as a joke, even if you're a wonderful parent otherwise.\n\nETA: u/spider-gwen89 has made some excellent points, please read their detailed comments!",

How cringey and uncomfortable that you act like you\u2019re doing so well but at the first hint of challenge, you pull your kids into your drama, and put them on the spot in front of a grandparent.

You did nothing wrong but first FINALLY, I hear of someone getting negative attention and the group speaks up in her defense, about time and good for them.\n\nAll thats going on here is the other married couple is feeling you out for a threesome and finally got busted.\n\nAlso, I am so tired of hearing about, well they have mental issues, in this case anxiety, and it might not be her fault.  If she was 10, you would have a case.  But as an adult of marrying age, NOPE, she has lived enough life to see it coming and avoid it for the most part.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (F,35) have had my fair share of romantic relationships, including an unexpected situation with a married couple about 9 years ago. I have recognised that this was a mistake and decided it was not my thing. However, since then I have not been in any relationships because I have since realised I am asexual and don\u2019t enjoy being intimate in general. \n\nFor the last 8 years I have been best friends with a completely different married couple who are quite conservative in that regard. We have some mutual friends who are in our circle but not really close. There have been several times (usually when they are drunk) when it seems like our mutual friends are trying to hint at the idea that me and my best friends are in a sexual \u201cthrouple\u201d situation. I am the quiet reserved type, so I don\u2019t talk about my sexuality, or lack of. \n\nAs they are often curious about my relationship status, they asked \u201cso, what is your type?\u201d , and the other mutual replied \u201cmarried\u201d. They all snickered and laughed as if they just spilled a secret. I was not amused as that part of my life is behind me, and I didn\u2019t like the fact that they are trying to hint at something that they have concluded on their own. I just kept quiet and was happy to ignore the comment and move on. However, other people kept making it a big deal and claimed it was an inappropriate comment. The one who said it obviously felt bad and got upset. \n\nShe abruptly left very upset. I literally did not say a word. I didn\u2019t pay no mind to the comment, although I was secretly offended.  I didn\u2019t want people to see that I was upset so I made sure I didn\u2019t look like it.  I must add that she does have anxiety issues that she deals with. \n\nBy the end of the night, I was made to feel like it was my fault that she got upset at her inappropriate comment and that I should have consoled her to let her know it was ok. \n\nIn my opinion, I am not responsible for making her feel ok about making an inappropriate comment.  AITA for not consoling her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

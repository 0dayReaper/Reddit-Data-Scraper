    "postText": "For context my grandmother 78 has 5 kids all of them came out bad, none of them work most are drug addicts but she is the sweetest person ever, because of her kind heart she raised 2 of their kids from toddlers to adults because of that and my mother and father raising me well and not needing or wanting for anything she kind of went hands off with me and my siblings focusing on the other kids. As a kid I always felt like she loved them more and didn\u2019t care about me, when I got older I tried to have conversations with her about it but her kids always stopped it. So no 25 years later when the kids she raised moved out I hoped to establish a relationship but at this time I was already set in my introverted ways I\u2019d visit but rarely she has never been to visit me. Now I found out from a family friend that she is very very sick and might not pull through but I don\u2019t feel like reaching out matters much she has had my whole life to mend our relationship and has choose not to do that. I don\u2019t want to regret not being there in her final days but I also don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m forcing something because it\u2019s the end AITA?\n\n\n\nThank you guys, I honestly have struggled with this for a while. Your right it\u2019s not her fault and I called my family friend to get her information since she has been moved to assisted living I do love her a lot and it has been hard since it feels like my other family has made it that way but it\u2019s is not her and I should be with her on her final days. We use to be very close tbh I think I made this a big issue because I don\u2019t think I wanted to think about my grandmother dying I got to be mad and blame her for the time we didn\u2019t have and that was easier than crying because I know it\u2019s close to over damn\u2026. Thanks to anyone that comment I\u2019m over here anime crying snot and all \ud83e\udd7a",

She wasn't trying to hurt you but you didn't need her as much so she had to prioritize her time.  I'm sure she loves you just as much but you were lucky enough to have parents who loved you too.  Count your blessings and go visit your grandmother!",

GM probably focused on the others because they let her and it sounds like she spent her life enabling them. \n\nOP is right in that there has been plenty of time for either OP or GM to establish a relationship. You might humor your parent by seeing GM. But OP should not feel guilty for not visiting someone dying whom they do not have any kind of close relationship with.",

            "comment": "Sorry but i feel like YTA for not caring about her or seeing her. You said it yourself, your grandma is extremely kind. She was so kind to raise her grandchildren as her own and frankly: a lot of people see the kids they are raising as their own so that could really well be the case for the grandma. Especially since she raised them since they were toddlers and depending on the dynamic, the grandchildren may see the grandma as their mother. Maybe that is why you felt different next to the other grandchildren. I also assume your grandma was fairly old for a parent role when she decided to raise her grandchildren so i assume she had her hands really full and just didnt have much time. Also, you cant really expect your grandma in her 70s to come and visit you quite often, she is too old for that. You may feel neglected and that could be understandable, but i feel like you only want to see it from your perspective. She was never mean to you or anything, she just didnt have much time. She sacrified almost her whole life to raise children and give Them a save and tidy home. You didnt need that, you and your parents didnt need such help so i feel like feeling that way is kind of entitled.\nAnd also: \"I was already set in my intoverted ways\" that is not your grandmas fault or anything and i honestly think it has nothing to do with the Situation.",

I'd be more than happy for all of my grandparents to die without them ever knowing me as an adult, 2 down, 4 to go (1 set of them divorced and remarried other people).\n\nIf you feel like you need some sort of closure then you're on borrowed time so you need to decide and you don't have the benefit of time on your side.\n\nGoodluck.",

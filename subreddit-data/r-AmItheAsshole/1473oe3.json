I know it\u2019s not what you wanted slugger, but be grateful you got anything at all. I\u2019ve had friends so poor the only gifts they got were from their friends. The birthday party itself was the gift for them. You\u2019re the asshole in this scenario, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to stay the asshole. It can always be worse kid, if you focus on the negatives it\u2019s all you\u2019re gonna see. Don\u2019t dwell on what you don\u2019t have, be grateful for what you do.",

Their job is to keep you alive and well, and in order to that they have to keep _themselves_ alive and well. Your mom is doing her best. Cut her a brake.\n\n\nWhen it comes to birthdays and christmas- as you get older you realize it's not about receiving. It's about giving. Instead of looking for what _you_ want consider giving others what you think they would like. That's the joy of life my friend.",

I'd recommend apologizing, letting it go and asking your mom how she's doing with the death a funeral. She might need it and she being heard can go a long way. Just let her know you love her and you care.  \n\n\nWorth noting even if she doesn't seem very distraught, many try not to show that in front of their kids and keep a strong face. They also try not to show how much they might be struggling financially so the children don't have to worry, and a funeral out of the country is likely costly.",

You gave her a list of stuff that you wanted, but your mother is under no obligation to fulfill that list. She is going thru an extremely rough time dealing with a funeral and all that goes along with it, and still found the time and consideration to get you something. Some things in life are larger than you or any \"wish list\" of what you expect someone to get you. You sound like a self-entitled little brat who throws a temper-tantrum every time you don't get what you want, when you want it, and how you want it.",

    "postText": "I'm a 45yro single father of three. Theur mom died 10 years ago. I have 3 sons, 17yro Andrew, 15yro Connor and 14yro Max. Connor was born female, he is trans. He came out as trans 5 years ago, and has now socially transitioned, not yet phisically.\n\nMy sister (38F) just got married. Me and my sons were also invited. My family has known that Connor is trans for 2 years now, some have adjusted well, some not so much. My sister is pretty indifferent about it. \n\nHer wedding was really super well organised to the last detail. She wanted all the men to wear shirt+tie and then women sundresses. I textednher a picture of our outfits the day before the wedding, and she said \"where's Nia's dress?\". I was a bit surprised and told her not to deadname my son and that he'll be wearing a shirt and tie like the rest of men there or we aren't coming. She said \"fine\" and that was it.\n\nAt the reception, my sister got mad that Connor was wearing a tie, but didn't say much after that. When we sat down at our table, the card \"Nia\". I went to my sister and she said she used \"their real name\". I told her me and the boys are leaving and she told me \"don't you dare cause a scene at MY WEDDING, Nia can be a guy any other day\". I called her a bigot and we left. \n\nMy family says I ruined her wedding.",

Won't someone *please* think of the transphobes who let something that has zero impact on them consume their thoughts!",

Respect is the most important part, and OP\u2019s sister completely and totally blew that.   NTA, well done, Dad!",

One time my mother's excuse was that it was especially hard because they don't refer to me that way when I'm not around (oof). And they wonder why I don't want to interact with them much (this is one of many reasons, but kind of exemplifies why I don't find them much of a comfort). I've explained and tolerated and tried to address it and just get met with the same thing every time, that they're trying and it's hard and they \"don't mean it that way\" and I constantly wonder if maybe I'm not being assertive enough/in the right way and maybe I should just let them be even though it obviously hurts me because it's hard for them and they don't mean it that way... sometimes I need a reminder that actually no, I'm not the problem here, they don't respect me and just saying \"but we love you\" doesn't change that. They just love some facsimile they have of me and get angry when I express any personal deviation from that.\n\nSo, thanks I guess. It's weirdly easy to forget that my family are outliers in the general consensus on stuff like this. 5+ years seems a perfectly reasonable time to get used to swapping like, four words you use to refer to someone. But when I talk to my family about it they act like I came out yesterday or some shit. Like, mum my voice dropped 3 years ago to baritone levels and I have shitty mutton chops, people are going to look at *you* weird if you call me your daughter.",

For some people, they grow up feeling very very strongly, knowing even, they have not been assigned correctly, for whatever reason the gender given based on their biological appearance at birth is wrong.  Basically OPs child knows and probably has always known since a young age, that he is a boy.  He happened to be a boy who was assigned female at birth due to not having male genitals. It's not that he wants to be a boy, it's that he is a boy and he is a boy trapped in the wrong body. OP is right to stand up for him.  OP may well have saved his sons life by supporting him.",

The idea of \"the wrong body\" is a wording that a lot of trans people don't like hearing because we love our bodies we just don't like how people perceive them. We just want the body we have to receive the respect our identity deserves. I hope I was intelligible I'm tired haha.\n\nA better wording is \"he is a boy that is being incorrectly perceived not to be\".",

Deadnaming means using the name they were given pre transition. It's a lot like of you know someone's name, but choose to get it wrong on purpose: really disrespectful, right?\n\nMisgendering means using the wrong pronoun to refer to someone. With trans people, it is generally best practice to use the pronoun that aligns with their gender presentation now. Connor identifies as a boy, so we should (probably, there's a chance he feels differently as an individual) always use 'he/his' when we talk about him, even if we are talking about him pre transition. From Connor's perspective, the person he is hasn't changed. He's not a different person before and after. He's the same person, who has always been a boy. The rest of society just got it wrong for the first dozen or so years of his life. It's only his outward presentation that has changed, to be more in line with how he feels.\n\nWhen you deadname, or misgender someone, especially on purpose, what you are saying is 'i reject your identity as you see it, and insist you change to make -me- comfortable'. No one likes being told they don't know who they are, and for trans people, pre transition can be a time in their life where they were uncomfortable, sad, and feeling isolated. It's a time that can be painful to return to, because it's absolutely filled with negative emotion landmines. You never know if where you end up going will blow up in their face and send them to a bad place. \n\nIn the long run, it appears you got the most important part: compassion. That's what really matters, if we treat people with compassion, we avoid most of the mines. I'm not trans but a handful of my friends are. You can pop me a message if there's something you don't understand and want to ask about.  No judgement here.",

Good on you for defending your son, although I suggest not revealing his deadname to the internet next time (may cause dysphoria if he finds out, some transphobes may use it against him, and it's called a DEADname because it doesn't exist anymore). Your sister disrespected your son's identity and is highly misinformed about trans people; it'd be great to try to educate her (so she'll stop deadnaming and misgendering your son) and if she doesn't listen, then screw her. Transphobes don't deserve shit.",

You did the right thing, your sister knew what she was doing when she picked that particular fight to start on that particular day.",

You'd think on her wedding day she would have better things to worry about than micromanaging everyone's outfits and upsetting people by disrespecting them.  \n\nIf she has issues with your son being trans, then she should have spoken to you privately in advance.  She would still be wrong, and it would still be none of her business, but it would have avoided outing herself as a bigot during her big day.  \n\nNTA never apologise for standing up for your sons.",

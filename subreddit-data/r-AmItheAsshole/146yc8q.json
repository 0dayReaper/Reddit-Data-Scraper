    "postText": "My (45f) partner (50m) has always spent a long time in the bathroom.  It's a running joke among his family for his famously long poops.  In our current house, we only have one bathroom. He always complains of stomach pains yet is not diagnosed with anything. He did go through a period of having colon polyps and i didn't fuss during that time.\n\nHe normally in the bathroom for a half an hour to an hour and that is prior to him showering which can take another 20 to 30 minutes.  Lately his bathroom time has gotten longer again. This will sometimes happen 3 or 4 times a day (he only showers once a day)  Sometimes over an hour.   I've mentioned that i understand he has some gastro issues however there are other people in the house and he is monopolizing the bathroom.\n\nAgain, this isn't new or sudden, even his family says it's always been this way.\n\nToday, i got extremely frustrated by it. He had been in there for over an hour going on an hour and half and still had not even showered. I knocked and asked if he needed medical attention and when he answered no i said he needed to get out and join the rest of the family and that this was insane. He needed to figure out why he needed to poop for so long or knock it off and that yes I'm timing him from here on out. \n\nIf it was once a day i might be able to understand but this is multiple times a day \n\nHe's now saying I'm being insensitive too his medical issues and not speaking to me. \n\nAita for getting annoyed?",

I used to do something like that as a little kid. I grew up with very little privacy outside the bathroom, so my restroom breaks got really long. I'd just go in and read a book. Is it possible it's something like that, where your husband just uses this as an excuse to hide away from people?",

He wouldnt just be content with 1-1.5 hr poop sessions 4-5 times a day.  No one with a true health problem would be satisfied to live like that without pursuing a resolution, even if they had to go to 5 physicians.\n\n4.hours a day, is 28 hrs per week, or 840 hours per month pooping, or 10,080 hours a years WASTED, spent sitting on the toilet.  \n\nI cannot conceive anyone with a health problem causing this wouldnt go to the ends of the earth to find a solution. Thus i am back to its not a health problem causing him to be in the toilet, he is using that time for something else.  It its not porn or an affair,.could be on reddit, twitter, etc.but if he always takes his phone w him when he's in the toilet, he is using the time for something non-toilet related \n\nHe could be hooked on porn since he was a teenager and being the bathroom was the only privacy he had.\n\nIf you are on the same phone plan you could keep track of his bathroom times for a couple of days, then check the phone bill and see if he is calling or txting during those time periods",

It's a running joke among his family for his famously long poops.  In our current house, we only have one bathroom. He always complains of stomach pains yet is not diagnosed with anything. He did go through a period of having colon polyps and i didn't fuss during that time.\n\nHe normally in the bathroom for a half an hour to an hour and that is prior to him showering which can take another 20 to 30 minutes.  Lately his bathroom time has gotten longer again. This will sometimes happen 3 or 4 times a day.  Sometimes over an hour.   I've mentioned that i understand he has some gastro issues however there are other people in the house and he is monopolizing the bathroom.\n\nAgain, this isn't new or sudden, even his family says it's always been this way.\n\nToday, i got extremely frustrated by it. He had been in there for over an hour going on an hour and half and still had not even showered. I knocked and asked if he needed medical attention and when he answered no i said he needed to get out and join the rest of the family and that this was insane. He needed to figure out why he needed to poop for so long or knock it off and that yes I'm timing him from here on out. \n\nIf it was once a day i might be able to understand but this is multiple times a day \n\nHe's now saying I'm being insensitive too his medical issues and not speaking to me. \n\nAita for getting annoyed?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

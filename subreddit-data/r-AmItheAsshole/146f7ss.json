Takes all of 5 minutes. If you want, you can buy those sifting cat litter liners (Alfapet, Amazon.com. Make sure it says sifting). Put the whole package of liners in the box, put the litter in on top. Every time you need to clean it, just grab one of the liners, bring the corners together, and yank. Hold it there until the loose litter stops flowing out, and shake it a few times to be sure it's all out. Tie the liner up in a small trash bag and toss in the ouside trash. Seriously, it's not that hard, and like I said, it's your kid too. You should *want* to do everything in your power to help your gf out. At this rate, she'll be lucky if you stick around long enough to change a shitty diaper. If she left you over this, it'd be entirely your fault because you're completely unsupportive of her.",

Asking her family to do it is ridiculous! You're there! It takes 5 minutes. Dread to think what you'll be like with an actual baby who depends on you to change a nappy. Maybe you'll want to rehome the baby until they are out of nappies because they only share 50% of your dna... \n\nCongratulations to your girlfriend and the cat for their newest member of the family.

Though it would still be best if you took over while she is pregnant. Or can a relative or friend keep the cat until the baby arrives? That would probably be safest for your gf.\n\nThis isn't something your gf made up as a way to get out of caring for the cat.

I don\u2019t hate them, but I don\u2019t like them. My girlfriend (23F) loves cats. She has had her cat since she was in high school, so naturally when we moved in together she brought her cat with her. I will not feed, water, or change the litter for her cat. We agreed that this is reasonable, and we\u2019ve never had a problem about it until recently when we found out my girlfriend is pregnant. \n\nMy girlfriend told me that her OB informed her that scooping cat litter while pregnant is dangerous. I reminded my girlfriend the agreement we had when we moved in together. Her cat is her responsibility. My girlfriend thinks I\u2019m being harsh, and I should just clean up after her cat because she\u2019s pregnant. However, I think that it\u2019s unfair to ask me to clean up after a pet that isn\u2019t mine. If she needs someone to clean up after her cat for her she should call her mom, her sister, or rehome her cat temporarily. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My husband still does it himself because it\u2019s his cat lol. But unless there\u2019s some missing info it\u2019s really not dangerous if precaution is taken (unless it\u2019s an indoor outdoor cat!)",

Her OB told her it\u2019s dangerous and maybe yours told you it\u2019s fine but that doesn\u2019t change that she should most likely listen to her OB.",

It causes serious and life-threatening issues to the mother and baby both. \n\nIf the boyfriend didn't want to deal with keeping his pregnant girlfriend and unborn child safe, he shouldn't have gotten her pregnant. \n\nOP never claimed to be anti-cat. He just didn't want to be the caretaker of the cat if his girlfriend just wasn't doing it, as in being lazy. And that's reasonable.\n\nBut making sure a pregnant woman stays in constant exposure to toxoplasma gondii is just an a-hole move.",

So unless there\u2019s complications I\u2019m a little stumped at this. \n\nSecondly - you agreed to the cat on specific conditions - but you didn\u2019t have anything there for when you had a kid together. So the agreement doesn\u2019t really stand. \n\nAlternatively you could stop being selfish and help your Gf - the mother of your child - look after something that is very important to her. You\u2019re being rigid and not a good partner. \n\nOverall I think you are more TA than her in the ESH",

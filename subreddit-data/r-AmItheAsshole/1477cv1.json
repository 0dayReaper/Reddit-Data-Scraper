Told her that she should do some reflection and that maybe her way isn\u2019t the best way. \n(2) I feel like a might be the asshole because she was confiding in some personal stuff about her family and kids. She has already lost a number of people around her and don\u2019t want to isolate her. She has a poor family history herself and says that they are all genetically are predisposed to have anxiety/depression and it was a coin toss if they all got it (and they did according to her).\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Really crappy. Yta crappy.\n\nOn the other hand, it doesn't sound like you said it harshly. It absolutely figures that someone that judgy doesn't want to see a mirror. I think it's something that in a different conversation would make sense to have said,  but not in the one where she's pouring herself out and needing you as a friend.",

She was in an emotional state already and what you said definitely didn't translate to 'don't be so judgemental of others;' instead she heard 'oh you're worried about your kids' depression? Well you know that's all your fault, right?' Your friend is an ass for vocally judging others, but in this specific scenario YTA",

I value the friendship and she has always been very supportive. However, she is incredibly judgement of other people\u2019s parenting - often makes comments about how they are the most involved and caring parents. She has lost a few friends herself recently for confronting them about parenting decisions. When I was visiting, she shared that all 4 of her kids (age ranging 9-18) are on antidepressants/anti anxiety medications are in counselling. She said she doesn\u2019t understand why her kids are the on a messed up. She herself has had childhood trauma and cut ties with most family members, but to my knowledge, there are no big T traumas for these kids. Her kids do zero extra curricular activities, spend a lot of time on social media, and read some beyond their age level reading material in terms of content (ie 13 year old reading nature romance novels). They all struggle in school and with maintaining friendships. I tried to gently point out while she was complaining about other people\u2019s parenting that she should not throw stones in glass houses\u2026 and could reflect on how her history and anxiety impacts the way she parents. This did not go over well, she is upset and not speaking to me - said her children are all genetically predisposed to have anxiety/depression, there is nothing they could have done differently.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

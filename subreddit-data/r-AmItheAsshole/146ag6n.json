    "postText": "My fianc\u00e9e (f, 31) and I (m, 30) want to get married this year. We both don't like traditional weddings and don't like being the center of attention. We want to get married primarily for us because we love each other - not for other people. If we had to have a traditional wedding with a lot of people, we would probably rather not get married.\n\nTherefore, we have decided that each of us will invite only one person (best man and maid of honor). For my fianc\u00e9e, this is \"Maria\"; for me, \"Frederik\". \n\n\"Kim\", a good friend of the bride, is also coming because she takes pictures and we both know her well. So in total we would be 5 people (bride, groom, best man, maid of honor and the friend who takes the photos). That\u2018s it. \n\nNow Frederik's partner Roger complains that he is not invited. There was a fight between him and my best man Frederik because of that. Roger says that he would not go to a wedding to which Frederik is not invited and he expects the same from his partner. \n\nHowever, we definitely don't want any other people there and have put a lot of thought into choosing three people. Not even our families are invited after all. I told Roger that we are not willing to change our plan and invite him. AITA?\n\n\n\nEDIT: We talked to Frederik again and he told us that he will attend the ceremony. He also said that Roger is unreasonable in this situation. \n\nA fact that we didn\u2018t mention before is that neither of us (fianc\u00e9e and I) were invited to their wedding 6 years ago. It was also a small ceremony and we totally understood so we thought it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for Roger. \n\nThanks for all your comments so far!",

She obviously wanted the guests to look either like children in a helicopter hat, or someone who is serving her in the soda hats, she just wanted an outwards sign of her own superiority and to make certain others knew she is so much better than them. Why else would you want guests in hats typically worn by children or a person serving you food/drink? This chick is unreal!",

It\u2019s a novelty hat that holds 2 beers with straws running to your mouth. All of the consumption is intended to be done by the wearer with the intent that their hands are free for the chicken wings. Think frat party or guys with their faces painted in their team colors tailgating before the game, not restaurants.",

Frederik needs to point out that he's serving as more a witness. \n\nRoger is not more important than your family who are also not invited to your very intimate ceremony.",

He already knows the wedding has only two guests/wedding party and a photographer. He shouldn't need to have it called a \"commitment ceremony\" instead of wedding to not be an asshole about this. Changing the wording gives no new info. \n\nWhat does Rodrick even want? Can you imagine what would happen if he \"won\" and was invited? OP and wife would have their little ceremony with one person each, friend would be taking pictures, and what . . . Rodrick would awkwardly stand to the side and stare? Or he'd try to butt in somehow? There's no good outcome here. It's incredibly awkward to want to be at a initiate 2 guest wedding you weren't invited to clearly upsetting the couple. \n\nFredrick has a partner problem.",

Either he will cave or he will whine and try to fight/flip this on you. The calmer you can remain the more unreasonable he will look, at least to Frederick. \n\nI'm really sorry you're in this position at all. \n\nNTA",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e (f, 31) and I (m, 30) want to get married this year. We both don't like traditional weddings and don't like being the center of attention. We want to get married primarily for us because we love each other - not for other people. If we had to have a traditional wedding with a lot of people, we would probably rather not get married.\n\nTherefore, we have decided that each of us will invite only one person (best man and maid of honor). For my fianc\u00e9e, this is \"Maria\"; for me, \"Frederik\". \n\n\"Kim\", a good friend of the bride, is also coming because she takes pictures and we both know her well. So in total we would be 5 people (bride, groom, best man, maid of honor and the friend who takes the photos). That\u2018s it. \n\nNow Frederik's partner Roger complains that he is not invited. There was a fight between him and my best man Frederik because of that. Roger says that he would not go to a wedding to which Frederik is not invited and he expects the same from his partner. \n\nHowever, we definitely don't want any other people there and have put a lot of thought into choosing three people. Not even our families are invited after all. I told Roger that we are not willing to change our plan and invite him. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

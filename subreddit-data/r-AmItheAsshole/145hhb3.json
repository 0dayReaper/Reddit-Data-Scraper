    "postText": "My friend (F 24) was a recent roommate and moved out of state to pursue a job. She was allergic to cats. I had always had pets growing up and wanted to have one again. We had some outdoor cats that I often fed and always liked to pet. I never let them in while my roommate lived here. The week she left I let one in and the cat was so happy. I had to help him out. I gave him a bath, got him fixed and he is now a very pampered prince living mostly inside with me. She was going to come back in two weeks to pick up the last bit of her things, but I promised myself that I would clean up before she came and vacuum as much cat hair as possible (not that he sheds that much). I did not tell her I was getting the cat, I had an incredible two weeks with the cat. Before she came back, I gave the cat to a friend to watch over so there wouldn\u2019t be extra dander in the apartment. Mind you I kept my roommates door closed so the cat would not go in. She comes back and if you\u2019ve ever had a cat, you know there\u2019s always a slight smell and slight dander. She immediately starts asking questions as her eyes get puffy. I told her I got a cat, but it has not gone in her room and I tried to vacuum as much as possible, and I even got her allergy meds. She did not have a bed, So she was expecting to sleep on the couch. The cat had been laying on the couch the past two weeks. I got her an air mattress and put it in her room though. We went on the porch so she could breathe a little bit better. She then proceeded to yell at me of how selfish I was, and how inconsiderate I was. I told her she had moved, and I was doing her a favor by letting her store stuff at my place. She stayed one night and then left when she was supposed to stay two night. We haven\u2019t talked in five days which is rare for us.",

However, if you were friends, that was a really crappy thing to do. \n\nAbsolutely, you should have given her heads up. \n\nIf you were a friend, you would have let her know you had a cat so she could make other arrangements.  Ideally you should have  waited to bring in the stray until she got back.  You could have also asked your friend that looked after the cat when your roommate came back to watch the cat for a few weeks.\n\nYou knew your roommate was coming back soon otherwise you wouldn't have agreed to let her keep her things there.  \n\nCat dander gets everywhere for people that are really allergic- it goes through AC vents. I have severe cat allergies - I get it.  \n\nTell your friend you're really sorry - you didn't realize how severe her allergies were and you didn't realize how much you'd miss her so you alleviated your loneliness by taking in a stray cat",

My best friends have a cat free room too for guests since they have multiple with allergies. \n\nYTA. OP should have let the former roommate know about the cat so she could have made other arrangements. And tbh i\u2019ve only been in one house that SMELLED of cat despite all my friends having them- they had multiple cats, not enough boxes and a cat with a spraying problem. It should not have smelled of cat in the two weeks she was gone if OP cleaned as she said so there\u2019s another problem on top of the allergies",

If her eyes were getting watery immediately from walking in then OP likely vacuumed the day she arrived, which can actually make allergy symptoms worse since it kicks dander up in the air - had the ex roommate known about the cat then they could have also discussed property precautions with OP.\n\nAllergies can be very severe and very uncomfortable for some people. Rather than just tell her so she could be prepared OP decided to hide it, wait until AFTER the ex roommate had a reaction, then fess up. She was going to let her sleep on the couch that the cat had been climbing on.\n\nYTA judgement on this one for sure - not for adopting the cat but for not giving the ex roommate any kind of opportunity to prepare.",

She might have been slightly annoyed but not as irate as walking into a place, expecting to stay there, and immediately succumbing to allergies.\n\nI have no allergies, but if I was a guest in someone else's house who, for all intents and purposes, had no animals and knew I was massively allergic, cleaning up and removing the animal temporarily is a great gesture and obviously enough if it works but.. In this case, the visiting friend still had an allergic reaction. \n\nIMO, there is not enough info. It has really nothing to do with whether or not the friend used to live with OP but more that the friend was planning on staying with OP who knew of the allergy. \n\nOP is def not in the wrong for having a cat but I can understand why the friend would be more peeved if she wasn't told in advance so she could make other arrangements.",

She left the cat somewhere else during the visit, she closed off the room, she even bought an air mattress and medicine for this specific reason. It was her right to get a cat, as the roommate had moved out, and she made accommodations for her. \n\nGranted, she should have told the roommate before hand, but I hope their friendship isn\u2019t so fragile as to end over some watery eyes.\n\nETA: Listen, I get that pet allergies can be severe. I have an uncle for whom cats cause an asthma attack. The struggle is real. After reading the replies here, I feel like my initial judgement minimized that. OP isn\u2019t 100% in the clear here. I just feel that, weighing all of the information provided, OP is more NTA than T A.\n\nEdit: spelling.",

However, yall are friends and she was under the impression that you were going to let her spend a night. You clearly knew she was allergic but tried to hide it from her? You can't just hide that from someone who is allergic to cats. All of this couldve been avoided if you had just given her a heads up that \"hey! I have let a cat in the house now!\" Obviously she's going to be annoyed at you. Her friend intentionally tried to hide the fact that there was a cat in the room despite knowing how cays affect her. You said she was struggling to breathe. I just don't understand how you can be friends with someone but not give them a heads up about something that causes them pain and trouble breathing. That would honestly make me rethink a whole friendship if a friend tried to hide something that they knew would cause me pain. \n\nYour not wrong for letting a cat in the house you own.

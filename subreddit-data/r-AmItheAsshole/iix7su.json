Both my husband and I lost our mothers very young (I was 18 when my mom died; he was 23) and we have both suffered a tremendous amount of loss since, including family and very close friends. In the case of my husband's mother, she fell into a coma very suddenly and spent a month unconscious in the ICU before dying. My own mother died of cancer, but lost her ability to speak very suddenly as a result of a serious seizure. We both learned the consequences of leaving things unsaid, so neither of us wants to risk going to sleep or leaving the house pissed off on the off chance something should happen to either of us.\n\n*That said,* we both readily acknowledge not every argument is easily solvable, so there have been times when bedtime has gone like this: \"I love you with everything I am, I know that we *are* going to work this out; I just need more time to cool off before I am able to rationally talk it out.\" Hugs and kisses, we can both rest easy. \n\nI'm sure not every couple with that \"rule\" is the same as we are, and we get that it's not feasible or understandable for everyone, but it's important to us.",

I went to sleep. He had to get up at 5:15 the next morning for work.

They were probably saying that sometimes it's okay to be selfish and do what's best for you even if it hurts your partner. Hell, isn't that what most breakups are like?\n\nFor almost half of the time OP and his girlfriend have lived together, it sounds like OP had been responsible for almost every household chore. That shit is draining, especially when you don't have an end in sight. I'm glad to hear they worked it out and have a solution to go forward on - that's the best outcome they could have had.

I\u2019ve been on both sides of this situation, I suffer from severe depression and I\u2019ve dated someone who also had depression but they literally did nothing to help them-self. They constantly refused to go to the doctor and made a complete drama out of taking antidepressants, while I was sitting there... someone who\u2019s had to wean myself off many types of antidepressants, deal with horrible side effects for years and I still put up with it because I wanted to get better and he flipped into a tantrum on day one of taking his meds. (And I mean full on child-like tantrum, as if the antidepressants were broccoli and he was a child that didn\u2019t like veggies.)\n\nThat relationship drained me so much that I had no choice but to end it, he was simply a lost cause no matter what I did to help him. \n\nBut the thing with Reddit is, a lot of people jump straight to \u201cBREAK UP!\u201d when they don\u2019t know the full situation and don\u2019t know the couple or what they\u2019ve both been through. What I gathered from OP\u2019s post is that his GF was going through a specifically bad bout of her depression getting worse brought on by the pandemic situation and losing her job, that\u2019s enough to put anyone in a bad place mentally and it wasn\u2019t normal behaviour for her to do completely nothing all day. That kind of depression to me, is one that can be worked on and dealt with in a nice and healthy way, without resorting to a sudden break up. Sometimes all a person needs is some loving support to get them back on their feet. \n\nHowever, if his GF was the type to completely refuse to do anything to help herself then in that case, it would have been good advice.",

Good on OP for learning something and becoming a positive force in her life. People with this kind of depression are just wired differently and need different stimuli to function best. Instead of pushing, creating the right kind of space (physical space, emotional space etc.) can often get the ball rolling and help them find agency. It's counterintuitive, so it's so heartwarming that OP made that step.",

I think psych nurses (PA's) are more commonly referenced for things like 'simple' depression instead of things like psychosis, they're usually easier to get into for treatment and copays cost a bit less.\n\nGood luck.",

I know you're not asking for advice any more, but if she likes online tutorials and yoga, can I suggest Yoga With Adriene?  I love her easy, calm demeanor.  She has several 30 day \"courses\", so once you pick a \"course\" it's not a chore to find another video to do the next day.  And she doesn't have to do yoga every single day--I would do it would do it with my friend, and we used to take off the weekends anyways.",

I'm not remotely spiritual or anything like that, but I just found it really valuable to a) have a chance to stretch out and do something different with my body every day when I was pretty much confined to the house sitting down all day and b) just have something to focus on each day. Some of the sessions are quite energetic and some are really chilled, and Adriene encourages you to go at your own pace. I am prone to depression and anxiety and it really helped me.",

It's just a simple agenda (with her favorite color on the cover, so it's pleasing for her to look at), which displays days week by week (so to directly have a look at her entire week). She can put any task she wants in there. For example, I myself did put that I had to paint my nails on tuesday at 5 and to make pancakes on thursday for my supper, nothing too hard, little things I usually enjoy doing. There only one rule, once a task is written in the book, it must be done, so she has to write with an ink pen :) she can also leave all days blank if that's what she wants ! But to be honest, I've only put tasks I really wanted to do but was too depressed to perform before. The book really helps :) once she feels ready, she might enjoy using that little trick. \nSorry for the bad spelling and such, English isn't my main language, and all the bests to you guys, you can fight this together, I know she will get better &lt;3",

Therapists will literally start by assigning \"tasks\" to people with depression and anxiety that are meant to target those problems. Someone with depression may be \"assigned\" the task of washing the dishes before the next session. They won't be assigned \"wash the dishes, do the laundry, mop the floor, mow the lawn, clean the bathroom\". The idea is to build up momentum and taking the first step, deciding where to start when the job seems so big, is often where a therapist will step in to help - they'll get you to tell them what's on your mind, then they'll help you choose a task. \n\nWe often get down on ourselves because we feel we need to do it all or nothing because the \"to do\" list is so long so what could one chore realistically accomplish? So then we don't do anything because our energy level is too low to clear the list, which makes us feel shitty about ourselves...which feeds into the depression - it's a repeating cycle. There are people in here who definitely have what you could best call e-depression - depressed online, ain't fuckin' never been to a therapist or they need to find a new one.\n\nLesson time - one person's depression doesn't equal another's. One chick would get pissed off if someone encouraged her, others routinely go to therapy for that kind of help. YMWV.",

If she\u2019s so tired she can\u2019t comprehend doing ALL the dishes (or whatever the chore is) have her tell herself she only needs to do it for 5 minutes. If she\u2019s still exhausted after 5 minutes, it\u2019s ok to stop. 5 minutes is better than no minutes. When there\u2019s a mess everywhere and you\u2019re exhausted and you think you have to do a whole overflowing sink full of dishes, it\u2019s hard to even get started. But often, once you get started, it\u2019s easier to finish. I hope this helps.",

Like in the example the OP gives of giving the girlfriend one task a day, that seems unacceptable to me and at that point the person should probably be taken care of by their parents instead of by their significant other, to me it seems they need a caregiver because they can not care for themselves or the person they are in a relationship with.

People with depression and mental illness, we do use it as an excuse to be lazy a lot and we shouldn\u2019t. There, I\u2019ve said it. It\u2019s true. People will argue with me till they\u2019re blue in the face but they know it\u2019s true too. It\u2019s a self fulfilling prophecy. Yes the depression makes motivation very difficult at times but we also tend to use it as an excuse to not motivate when we know we are capable. We get comfortable using it as a crutch and we do indulge ourselves.\n\nHer mom is only enabling and hurting her by coddling her instead of expecting her to get help. It\u2019s totally understandable to be depressed but it\u2019s entirely another thing to just accept it and not seek help. You have a right to live in a clean house the way you like it and also to expect the person you live with to pull their weight especially while not working. Unfortunately that may not be possible with your girlfriend. She sounds like she\u2019s quite comfy in her depression and has no motivation to get better or change. Especially with mommy waiting around to defend her and come to her rescue any time anyone expects something from her. \n\nEdit: I\u2019m really glad you guys found a plan that seems to be working.

He told me that he\u2019d been researching all day (he literally had a notebook full of things he\u2019d written down) and that I didn\u2019t have to eat it, but that I was not unfixable and he was going to try everything possible for me to feel better.

This is a good first step. \ud83d\udc95\n\nI hope I'm not overstepping, but I highly recommend Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.  I do a \"refresher\" every couple of years and it is honestly amazing.  It really does make a huge difference.\n\nFollowing advice groom a former therapist, I usually recommend a craft or some such as a task for the day.  5 minutes a day, that is all I have to commit to. Some days I do five minutes and that's it, I'm done. Some days I dive in and can go for hours.  Doing a craft involves concentration (on something other than one's troubles), it stimulates the creative centres of the brain, and you have a feeling of accomplishment at the end.  My own go to craft is crochet, and making a granny square coaster is an excellent beginner project.  I made a blanket where I made one square (or triangle) a day and at the end I sewed them together and made a blanket.  Every time I look at it I see a symbol of the work I put in and I pinch myself and remind myself \"I made that, no-one else did that, it's MY accomplishment\".   Other crafts include colouring in books (don't knock them, they really help), jigsaw puzzles, and sewing little things like cat toys, scrunchies, that sort of thing.",

There is a possibility that her depression will never go away, and that this issue will continue to be present for the duration of your relationship.\n\nI spent a long time working on my relationship/marriage.  12 years to be exact.  I allowed myself to be unhappy, and just shake it off because \"that's what a good husband does.\"  You don't concern yourself with your own happiness, you swallow it, learn to let go, and try your hardest to still be a good husband.\n\nThe only thing that it got me was bitterness and resentment.  I realized that I would never have the things that I really wanted in my then-wife, so I tried hard to let go and just love her and be a good husband.  It did not work.  She asked for a divorce back in March, and I've realized only now exactly how unhappy I was, and for how long.\n\nI am not going to be your typical redditor and say \"break up bruh,\" but you should ask yourself whether this is a pattern that you can continue for the rest of your life.  I am certain that it will reappear, and if you have kids things will be that much more severe.\n\nDon't sit in unhappiness.  I wish I could say loving a person is enough, but sometimes it just isn't.  She may never change, and this may never get better.  Or, it could get better and she may be the person you imagine her to be.  Are you willing to stick by her forever if she is not?",

And it can\u2019t happen until she\u2019s ready for it to happen, but after me dealing with depression for 4+ years, I finally got on antidepressants that work for me and holy shit does it make a difference. \n\nBeforehand I really felt like my depression was situation based, that if I got out of the life I was living it would be better. I went to therapy. Then last year we moved cross country to be closer to my family and start fresh. It helped immensely, but my depression was still there. Without something to \u201cpin\u201d it on, I came to the conclusion that there was a chemical imbalance in my brain. \n\nI\u2019ve been on antidepressants for about 6 weeks now and haven\u2019t felt this good consistently in *years*. It really really helps. \n\nAlso, if insurance is an issue, check with your employer/insurance. Sometimes they allow basically domestic partners to be on your insurance without being married. She just has to have been dependent or co-dependent on you for 6-months and live with you (at least that was the case for me, I was on my husbands insurance while we were just dating). I think insurance companies started adding this in for same-sex couples before same-sex marriage was legal so they could still be insured.",

Often the therapist writes a referral, then she sees a random psychiatrist and gets the meds. But a referral isn't *needed* just to find a psychiatrist. It's best to have both, but you don't need one in order to see the other. It can be hard, but google can help.\n\nAside from that, I'm glad this has worked out.

It's impacted by a great many other things, not least of all your own nature, environment, comorbities, and family history. Depression, and mental health in general, is a spectrum; one person with depression will not behave or even recover like another so your need to brag about yourself is inappropriate here.\n\nI've been depressed off and on since my teens. I've gone through periods where I could easily get to work and kick ass, come home and clean, make plans for home improvement, remind my husband of the stuff he's forgetting, exercise my dogs, etc. but still generally feel \u201coff\u201d, joyless, easy to agitate. Yet, I yanked myself out of deep depressions when I was 19, and again when I was 23 that were worse. My current bout of depression has been unbearable, I've been physically *exhausted* beyond all reason and it's frustrating to me as well. I'm an ambitious person, I have a bachelor's and a master's and I started work on a second bachelor's just because I could and I wanted to. It\u2019s just been hanging on since my brother died last year and a bunch of other shit kept going wrong afterward. Fortunately, my husband doesn\u2019t feel the need to puff up his chest and play tough with me. He knows I\u2019ll get it sorted, I always have.\n\nTelling someone to have \u201cmoxy\u201d (\u2014&gt;moxie?) is like asking someone with bronchitis to simply stop coughing. This is literally a defining symptom of the illness, it\u2019s literally how it\u2019s diagnosed, it makes no sense. There *will* be periods of time where a person is down, that\u2019s the whole \u201cin sickness and in health\u201d shit you\u2019re supposed to agree to when you marry, if this is too much to ask then I don't even see the point in ever dating. As long as she\u2019s trying to make progress that\u2019s good. That her therapist only wanted to engage in talk therapy after how long of trying and failing\u2026that\u2019s probably related, don\u2019t ya think? Shit, when I was in college and depressed step one was prescribing medication before I had a chance to fuck up my classes, there are just times when talk therapy is not the first step to linger on *at all*. They should have moved on to medication by now because she already had a pre-existing history of depression. No wonder she feels like shit, christ she\u2019s stuck in a rut and this guy\u2019s like, \u201cLet\u2019s talk it out while I charge you an arm and a leg\u201d. Starting meds allows the talk therapy to talk hold, you gotta get stable first. She'll be fine once she finds a more engaging therapist.",

Just getting out of bed can be a chore. Setting small achievable tasks is one way to help some people manage. Meds are another. \n\nKudos to you for recognizing that you were in the wrong and for trying to do what is right. Good luck to both of you.",

I have been both the person who was depressed, and the person struggling to keep things together because the person I was with was struggling with situations that triggered depression. It can be harder, for me at least, to watch someone struggling than to be struggling myself. Both are hard and painful. Thank you for taking in suggestions and information and changing your approach to better help your girlfriend. It sounds like you have really come together and I bet your relationship will be stronger because of it! I'm glad that you are both working on household tasks together, it really helps to be back on the same team, and I hope that things continue to improve. Best of luck to you and your girl!",

I feel her slump, been there before and it really takes a supportive partner to get you back to normal. Try to go outside once or twice a week, just being outside in a little nature raises endorphins. Work up to maybe camping in an established campground or bnb by a park/wilderness. Little steps make a huge difference and will for you as you\u2019ve stated. \n\nYou\u2019re a good partner OP for seeing your own errors and correcting. People tend to forget to evaluate their own actions and try to improve the next time. Good luck op.",

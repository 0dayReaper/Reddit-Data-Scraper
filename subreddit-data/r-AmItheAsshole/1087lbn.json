    "postText": "My dad passed away 2 weeks ago. Me, my wife 'Candace' and my daughter (16) 'Shiloh' and her stepsisters (19) &amp; (17) flew to my hometown to attend the funeral. After that we got 2 hotel rooms (one for me and Candace, one for the girls).\n\n\nWhile I was in the room, I got a call from Shiloh at 11pm crying and sounded like she was arguing with her stepsisters. I asked what the matter was and she told me that her stepsisters insisted that she sleep on the floor (there were one large bed in the room and there was enough space for all 3 girls to sleep on). I asked why and she said she didn't know. I went to see what the issue was and talked with my stepdaughters about it. They kept talking but didn't really explain why they told her to sleep on the floor. They just shrugged and said \"It's better this way...we're more comfortable this way..\". I told Shiloh to grab her things and when one of my stepdaughters asked where we were going, I told her I was booking her a hotel room. Both looked upset but didn't say anything but they must've called their mom because she was awake when I got back and started arguing with me about giving Shiloh an entire hotel room for herself. I explained why I did it but she said I wasted money and that Shiloh could've sucked it up for one night on the floor. I called her unreasonable for saying this but she told me I showed the girls that I'm \"playing favorites\" and made my stepdaughters share a room while I gave my daughter and entire room for herself.\n\nWe went home and Candace is still bringing it up saying I mishandled this. She even pointed out how my stepdaughters are upset since they're not speaking to me.\n\n\nETA It was Candace who got a room for the 3 girls as to not stir any drama and save money. She was in charge of hotel reservation since I was emotionaly distressed.\n\nAlso. Candace did NOT expect Shiloh to sleep on the floor. She wanted all 3 girls to share the bed.\n\n\n\nETA#2 For those that are calling me an ah for giving my daughter her name. Her mom did that and she's deceased so please let's not focus on that.\n\nAnd also, I've known my stepdaughters since they were little. We're pretty much family and Candace is a sahm but I give her full access to my money since this stuff was already discussed before handed. Pretty much everything was.",

What's extra gross is that they did it when coming back from Shilo's grandparent's funeral. Talk about cruel.\n\nYou're definitely NTA. But also wtf is wrong with Candace if she sees this as playing favorites? Her daughters tried to make yours sleep on the floor for fun. Sounds like the apples don't fall far from the tree. Have you pointed out your daughter is also upset because of the situation and ***she*** is playing favorites?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards, people of the internet!",

Don't trust her to make arrangements in the best interests of anyone going forward and have a serious sit down about how this whole thing was handled, including her attitude towards the girls and the way she tried to DARVO this to make it your fault. You do not want your child spending years being bullied and I can promise you that those girls learned it from someone - I'm betting it wasn't their bio dad. Make sure Shiloh knows she can come to you because bullies can choose to keep going and just get better about hiding it.",

Saved $5 on the \"surprise\" room thinking that it will might have a couch but most hotels I've been to recently don't. Almost certainly stepmom gave the ok for this to her daughters that \"someone\" might have to sleep on the floor and was tacitly agreed that the someone wasn't them. If there were two beds almost certainly the same thing would happen because they \"wouldn't be comfortable sharing a bed\" and \"someone\" can just sleep on the floor. If I were OP I'd keep this one on record because this type of \"comedy of errors\" only happens when you don't have respect for someone else. I'm sure this is \"all a big misunderstanding\" from Mom and her daughters when they now realize they fucked up. IMO this is the kind of thing that would cause \"marriage probation\" as that's not operating as a family. I'd be extra cautious about things for my own child moving forward. If this is the first big thing like that noticed I am sure there are dozens of smaller ones unnoticed or brushed aside just like they tried to do with the sleeping arrangements.",

Did she intend for this to happen?",

Also your wife saying YOU played favorites when she wanted her daughters to get a bed and yours the floor is pretty ironic don\u2019t you think?? Her and her daughters sound like the evil step family\u2026.(also you and you\u2019re daughter could\u2019ve shared a room and Candace and her daughters could\u2019ve shared a room, just a thought)",

I know people go nuclear with the \u201cleave this relationship\u201d talk way too often on Reddit, but my daughter\u2019s treatment is not something I would be willing to budge on if things don\u2019t change immediately.",

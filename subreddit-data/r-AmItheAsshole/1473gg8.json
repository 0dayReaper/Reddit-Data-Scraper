    "postText": "My (20f) mom died last week. The funeral will be next friday and I don\u2019t want to go. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m grieving but because I don\u2019t want to spend time and money to travel to another city and effectively wasting the time I have to study for my end of semester exams coming up next month.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a close relationship with my mom anyway. She was an addict and a terrible mom. When I was 7 I was taken away by cps and placed with my dad full time. When I was 10, she showed up on our doorstep in the middle of the night screaming her lungs out how I was taken from her unfairly and how my dad was a piece of shit for lying to the court to have me taken away. I didn\u2019t hear from her for about 5 years afterwards.\n\nSince I was 16 we\u2019ve had sporadic contact that boiled down to one or two texts a month which mostly ended with her asking for money or telling me I should come and live with her again. As bad as this makes me sound, I don\u2019t miss her and don\u2019t think I ever will.\n\nNow that the funeral is coming up I\u2019ve been asked by my grandma when I\u2019d be coming and if I\u2019d be helping with preparations. I told her I wouldn\u2019t be coming as I had no time to spend on the funeral of somebody who treated me terribly.\n\nShe didn\u2019t take it well, calling me selfish and ungrateful for disrespecting my mom by putting uni above saying my goodbyes. I understand that she\u2019s grieving her daughter but at the same time I don\u2019t want to be there and I feel like she should accept that. \n\nMy dad is on my side but a few of my cousins from my mom\u2019s side have messaged me what a shitty person I am for treating my mom and my grandma this way. My relationship with my grandma was generally a good one but she hasn\u2019t responded to any of my calls since our argument. \n\nShould I just suck it up and go? Maybe I could just come for the church stuff and leave afterwards so I wouldn\u2019t lose the whole weekend. I still don\u2019t want to go though.",

They probably enabling her addiction instead making her into the mother she should have been and being responsible for her actions. You are the child and they where the adults and they failed you so you don't owe them nothing. I wouldn't go because I feel they keep with the toxic behavior and it wouldn't benefit yourself. No child should go threw what you been threw. You don't owe them anything.",

It's not a \"who's who of the deceased's life\" or a \"you didn't love her/I loved her more\" attendance form.  \n\nYou process your grief however feels right to you.  Even if that is studying for finals.  If you and your mom were BFF's it still wouldn't be any less meaningful to you to say goodbye in your own way.",

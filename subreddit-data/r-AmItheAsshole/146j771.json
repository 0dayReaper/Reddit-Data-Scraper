    "postText": "I have been apart of a friend group since freshmen year with S, R, N, and J. Ive always felt like an outsider in their group as they all were friends before but became a group last year. Last year I told them I feel anxious going into ft calls but I also told them that I don\u2019t mind with them. We called after that, but this year I noticed they stopped calling the gc and started calling each other separately. They are all also friends with other ppl and hang out w/o including me. They always talk about all these diff ppl n whenever i ask who/what they are talking abt they say dw abt it or they expect me to alr know. For my bday this year S and N just put their names down on the gift R got me. Last year N didnt even get me a gift at all.\n\nLast week I asked R and S to see the new spiderman movie cause I knew they were big fans. We were ok to go last Friday but on Thursday they both cancelled saying that their parents were mad and wouldnt let them go. I didnt mind at first but before I went to go watch the movie I opened insta and saw them hanging out on their stories. Ive been ignoring them since, especially S and R, and stopped texting in the gc. R and S both msged me asking if I was ok cause of my weird behavior n I just said I was fine. I caught up on msgs in the gc and saw J wanting to watch the movie and S replied that they all shld go on Sat for her birthday. None of them thought to ask if I was free until the day before when R finally asked. I didnt want to go anymore, so I made up an excuse n said no. At school, I was distant with J and ignored S in class. At 12am today, I wished S a happy birthday and apologized for both being distant and for not being able to make it to the movies today. She replied saying she appreciated it and wanted to understand what was going on bc she feels like I am mad at her. I am not ready for a talk yet and told her that I will talk to the whole group soon on what has been going on I just need some time to myself. She liked the msg and didnt reply.\n\nI feel bad for ignoring them, especially S right before bday, but my other friends are saying not to feel bad and I shouldn\u2019t have apologized for anything besides not being able to come to her party. The day before my bday last year I playfully made a comment about S' grades thinking it was okay since we often joke around. I understand why she was mad, however she completely ignored me and didn\u2019t wish me Happy bday. On my bday, I sent her a paragraph explaining that I was sorry and didn\u2019t mean to offend her because I thought it was like our normal arguing, and all she replied with was a \u201cok, thank you\u201d. They also had to cancel on my other friends party cause they were going to sm elses party. They told her 3 days before her bday and my friend told me she ended up crying because so many people kept canceling. She was super upset the entire week.. I do intend to talk to them soon about everything, but idk what im going to say/do.",

That doesn't sound like something friends would do. Stop apologizing for their shitty behavior and ask them straight up what is going on because they're the ones acting strange not you.\n\nI'm worried they're going to try and gaslight you  if you confront them so be prepared for that possibility.",

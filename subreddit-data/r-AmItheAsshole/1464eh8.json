The family maintained their faith and passed down their religion and traditions through the generations as am doing with my children. There was talk about \"We don't buy German cars\" and the like, but honestly I'm not into that.\n\nAs people raising a new generation of global society, we need to be more open. Not open to hate, ignorance, and oppression, mind! But, open to the idea that what once was, no longer needs to be. People persecuted Jews, blacks, Chinese, Japanese, Native Tribes from all over the world because they were different or wanted world domination or other stupid reasons. We need to do better! We need to teach love, history, and heritage as things to be celebrated,shared and appreciated.\n\nSo, if you want your kids to call their grandma Oma, they should. And you shoukd tell them your stories and teach them about who their ancestors were and whatever else they might want to know that will make them fabulous humans in this ever-changing global world they are going to be living in. Love, embrace, and celebrate differences!",

There\u2019s a notable bent in the teaching of American History toward American *victory*. While WWII is greatly examined, I found the majority of curriculum doesn\u2019t tend to talk about Hitler\u2019s rise to power, but the activities of the war once it\u2019s already ongoing. It\u2019s more about events rather than motivations. There also tends to be a larger emphasis on the Pacific Theatre, as American involvement in the war was heavily tied into that front due to the events of Pearl Harbor, as well as America\u2019s Naval and Aerial power and readiness to engage with Japan.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be fair of me to simply assume you support Trump or other far-right politicians, but the fact you say \u201cdipshit is bringing his politics into this.\u201d in regards to them saying we currently have a problem with \u201cHitler-type rhetoric\u201d in the upper echelons of our political circles, gives me this impression. I don\u2019t understand your upset with this statement, as it is true. America is suffering from many critical problems, most notably an ever increasing wage gap that only stands to exacerbate almost every other problem faced by it\u2019s citizens, yet the leaders on the far-right waste their time and efforts trying to ban drag queens reading to children and a woman\u2019s rights to decide to do with her own body as she pleases. Note, that your stance on abortion here is irrelevant, as there are plenty of documented cases where there is no viable life in womb being \u201cprotected\u201d and yet a pregnant woman\u2019s right to medical care is still being denied. Books are being banned and children are being denied a proper education about their own bodies and proper sexual health. These are the issues the right has chosen to try and distract the populace from it\u2019s agendas. They have chosen LGBT+ people as their sacrificial lamb, as their \u201clesser than\u201d, to stigmatize and other in the name of giving their followers a boogeyman, a fear they can unite against. They didn\u2019t need to pull the race card because it already existed in America, so those minorities are already prejudiced against and it\u2019s just becoming increasingly more openly demonstrated. The rhetoric of the far right is making these people bold about spreading their fear and hatred. And so it was with the Third Reich.  \n\nYou say say that information about WWII was crammed down your throat in school, and yet you failed to learn even the most basic of information about how or why it ever got to that point in the first place.",

Your partner had to look it up in order to be offended. She needs to understand that not everything from a German word relates to the holocaust.  \n\nAlso as a bonus, as you said, the Dutch were decimated by the Germans.  I have a friend who's mother-in-law was Protestant Dutch and was at a boarding school during ww2 and her whole family and village disappeared and she never saw them again.",

I should also add that my grandparents are holocaust survivors, my grandfather an Auschwitz survivor. So with all of that context, I do NOT think that calling your mother Oma is disrespectful. It is being used in the context of a Dutch grandmother and shouldn't be extrapolated any further than that\nA lot of Yiddish words also have German roots and no one blinks at that, context is important \n\nI would broach this topic with sensitivity to your wife and explain how this is your mother's way of honoring her family and heritage and shouldn't be conflated with Nazi Germany. Try to understand why this triggers her, generational trauma isn't always rational but she may feel less triggered if you're able to understand her perspective and then come around to yours",

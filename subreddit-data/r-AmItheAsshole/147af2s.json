I've been bugging her to make an appointment with our doctor or go to the walk-in clinic for a couple weeks now.

I've told her I don't think the quality of these services are the same as actually seeing the doctor but she told me she's too busy with work to see an actual doctor and they'll just tell her the same thing. I pointed out if the roles were reversed she'd be on me but she just ignored that. I even told her that going to the walk-in clinic in the early morning would likely mean no wait times as I've done it several times myself but she also just ignored that. \n\nThings got heated and we ended up snapping at each other and I told her I feel like she doesn't care about her health. Now she's mad at me and wants me to apologize. I understand she's an adult and I can't force her to go to the doctor, but AITA for nagging her about this?",

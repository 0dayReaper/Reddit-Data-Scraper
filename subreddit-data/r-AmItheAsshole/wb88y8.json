    "postText": "**ETA**: There may have been some confusion as to my gf's reaction, she was ashamed her family dug so deep into me, not about my response. After wanting to die for the next 48 hours she agreed I did the right thing and that it was funny\n\nBackstory: due to my dad's job we lived in Italy for 3 years when I was younger, so I speak Italian almost fluently (it's been awhile, so I've lost some of it)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently I started dating a girl. She's great and I love her so much. I met her family a few nights ago for dinner. She warned me that the male side of her family is very big into being macho, into \"testing\" the boys the women date and are VERY big on taking pride in their Italian ancestry. I think besides the grandfather, however, they were almost all born in Bergen County, NJ but whatever, its nice to take pride in ones heritage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short at dinner they kept making jokes at my expense (I honestly would not call it bullying, just things about my height, beard, shaved head). They tried making fun of my IT job too but stopped once I told them my income. It was overall not a bad experience, but a not so pleasant one. Anyways, her older brother kept pushing things, giving me exceptional amounts of shit for playing Lacrosse in HS (apparently its a sport for prissy rich kids and not manly like football or baseball). He ended his rant by saying \"hey, we're just a big Italian family, we're loud and tell it how we see it! Hahaha!\" and all the family except my girlfriend laughed. So I, for the next minute, responded to everything they said in Italian. My girlfriend buried her head in shame, the grandfather laughed and everyone else kept looking at each other confused before telling me they didn't speak Italian. I replied \"then don't use your Italian heritage as an excuse to behave poorly when you can't even speak the language.\" They got mad, but the grandfather told them all I was right and to be quiet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend isn't mad, just ashamed, I think the grandfather likes me, but word from my gf's sister is that all the men are furious, think I'm a smart ass and that I disrespected them and their masculinity in an unforgiveable way. So AITA?",

The family I boarded with were Italian immigrants, and only the teenage daughter spoke good english. The parents were not often there, because they both worked a lot, and the grandma was in charge of feeding me. She spoke only Italian. One morning she was failing to convey a question by signs, and called the daughter to come and ask me if I wanted eggs for breakfast. Italian and french are sometimes similar, plus I studied latin, which also helped me understand what she was saying. I answered in approximate Italian \"Si, si, un' uovo\" and she was extatic. Nonna raised her hands to the sky, then hugged me, and I probably could have made her sign adoption papers on the spot.",

That student also would have gone to a French host family for a bit.\n\nIt's tricky because you can't really exclude a single kid from the class from taking part, but also most of these exchange programmes have visiting kid attend classes at the host kids school during the day or attending some one off workshops, so most of their day would still be immersed in an English environment.",

We welcome people like family and treat them as such. Can we get loud and passionate about things, sure, everyone can. Are we proud and enjoy our heritage and customs, very much so. But being a rude ah to someone new to the family or anyone really is unacceptable. Think less jersey shore and more respect. That's how any and all from my family would expect and others we know. Yes, I know a few who could pass as the loud Italian American New Yorker, like my uncle. But he is only loud cause he is deaf... :)",

These men told OP to his face they just like to be blunt and tell it like it is because they are Italian, and he absolutely did just that without even needing to be Italian. I think the fact that Grandpa here thought it was hilarious and not offensive shows that those dudes might have needed that bonk on the head to chill them out.\n\nThere's always a higher road to take in these situations, but sometimes punching from the middle isn't entirely unwarranted. Overall I just found this way too amusing. The machismo veneer only needs a tiny hole poked in it to just completely vanish for some people.",

As a result, Italian American culture reflects Southern Italy of that time. \n\nHowever, most people talking about Italians they worked with or visiting Italy are talking about Northern Italians. The cultures are fairly different. Northern Italy is where the money and industry are. Southern Italy is much more rural and poor.\n\nAs a result, Italian-Americans reflect a culture which isn't dominate in Italy, and also reflects a historic culture which has changed.\n\nIt's a huge issue with immigrant communities where the idea of their home culture can get stuck in the time/place of the immigrants. Sometimes it gets complicated and displaced too, as new waves come in. In the US, it was rare to hear Mandarin in Chinatowns before \\~1980, as most residents were Cantonese speakers. But before \\~1960, it was rare to hear Cantonese, as most Chinese-Americans before 1960 spoke Taishanese. Its just the pre-1960s crowd was highly assimilated, usually being 2nd or third generation descendants of Chinese-Americans prior to the exclusion act. In the 1960s, a wave of immigrants came via HK.\n\nThis has had major influences in the identity of Chinese-American culture as families long assimilated get overtaken by a larger wave of recent immigrants, and how a wave that was either very poor or very rich in the 60s has been slowly displaced by more middle class immigrants.",

And ice rinks are more expensive to build and maintain than fields of other sports. And those higher costs start a lot earlier too, since kids start playing it at a younger age generally.\n\nEdit-2 note: heh, apparently I opened a can of worms since I'm getting DM'ed about costs. Yes there are also other reasons ice hockey is more expensive. I wasn't trying to enumerate an exhaustive list. You can google for it. :)",

I think you know being 'Italian American' is  it's own deal outside of Italian ancestry. \n\nBut the main thing is the relationship with you and your GF. If you want a long term relationship with this woman you're going to have to interact with her family (that she likely loves despite her brothers A-Holeishness) she shouldn't be in the position of choosing between You who she's only been dating a short time, and her family.\n\nThey are the AHs but make sure you don't get into a habit of one upping them as far as education/ $$/world travel etc; stand up for yourself but don't let that turn into elitism. I'd think it would be less common now but thinking back in their Grandfathers day there was a lot of prejudice against immigrants and generational resentments &amp; defense mechanisms are real things.  (not saying immigrants to day aren't subject to prejudice - more over Italian Americans are not the ones being targeted at the moment)",

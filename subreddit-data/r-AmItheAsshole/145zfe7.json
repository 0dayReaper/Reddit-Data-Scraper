    "postText": "Me (37)f, married, have been friends with A (36)m, separated, for decades. \nA couple of years ago, we bonded over a traumatic incident and got close. \nA, separated from his wife around that time and there have been a uncomfortable incidents related to jealous gfs of A. \nWe stopped meeting each other after a while but remained in close contact via text.\nA couple of weeks ago, I received a threatening message from B(f) saying she would reveal private chats (nothing incriminating) between A and myself to my DH.\nI ignored and told A to defuse situation but this went on for a few days. Eventually I responded only to receive a barrage of accusations and demands for answers, photos &amp; private text messages between A and several other women he had been seeing.\nI told B that A\u2019s private matters were none of my business and she should stop threatening me. B ask to meet, demanding to know more about my relationship with A insinuating we were having an affair. I refused to meet but continued to respond. She went on to say strange things like he was obsessed with me, incessantly texting and wouldn\u2019t let me go. I didn\u2019t deny. \nB confronted A, lied that I confessed to an affair. B got very upset with me and says I got involved in his business and he doesn\u2019t trust me anymore.\n\nAITA for not minding my own business and responding instead of hitting the block button.\n\nEdit to add: some of the chats between us can be seen as inappropriate and very frequent.\nThe traumatic event was the death of a close friend, many of our discussions were related to the circumstance surrounding his death. \nA lot has been said, I don\u2019t think our discussions are inappropriate but taken out of context, I can see how his gf thinks it might be inappropriate.\nUpdate:\nHit the block button and B has gone full on stalker mode. Asked for passwords and remote to A\u2019s accounts; when denied tried to hack into both our accounts. \nA confessed there were signs early on\u2026 I worry about this self destructive behaviour but friendship might be over\u2026",

She is full of drama and you tried to defuse the situation but she used your engagement with her as ammo against your friendship with the dude. \n\nIt sounds like he MIGHT have cheated on her, but she could just be lying about that. What\u2019s clear is she\u2019s trying to isolate him from you. Just reassure him that you value his friendship, apologize for responding to his crazy gf (don\u2019t call her that lol), pointing out that you were trying to help, and ask him when he wants to get together to play darts or something to clear the air.",

(For reference bf has told me \u201cyour into gay stuff now but your going to marry a man (he doesn\u2019t know I am ftm)\u201d) Bf then goes \u201cno it\u2019s a want, plus your still very young why cant you go when your twenty.\u201d I\u2019m shocked and mom doesn\u2019t comment yet so I go \u201cI came out young, it\u2019s a part of me, I want to experience it young.\u201d Bf goes silent, gives mom a look and she chimes in \u201cwell based on what I\u2019ve seen at pride, and I\u2019ve gone many times, it\u2019s not appropriate.\u201d Then bf speaks up AGAIN \u201cyea.. idk about the gay stuff and I\u2019ve never been to pride but go at 18 or smthin your still young.\u201d Btw mom was going to take me to pride until her and bf started talking. So at this point I\u2019m pissed off at him bcs he doesn\u2019t even know what I\u2019m talking about. So I\u2019m just sitting there silently and he goes on about making a group of friends and just hanging out instead and I\u2019m like \u201cit\u2019s not the same thing, pride is special\u201d then my mom who was on my side until bf started talking says \u201cyou make everything an argument, all you want to do is argue you never want to listen.\u201d I was so frustrated because I already had plans and now because of bf everything\u2019s ruined so I say \u201cit\u2019s not arguing I\u2019m trying to explain my point it would be arguing, If I was saying he was wrong but I\u2019m not\u201d and then I left the room.

I\u2019d almost rephrase your argument as her having a need to go just as much as you. \n\nI\u2019m a CIS male who has never been to pride, but I\u2019d certainly go with my son if he wants when he\u2019s your age.

Keeping the peace sounds like the best route to safety here. That's a fight that you don't want to take on head-on and with high emotions. Incidents like that happen but starting an argument in a homophobic household with a logical fallacy is just a nice circle around the target on your back.\n\nETA: Gay people aren't monolithic and we can have different opinions on our own traditions.

One of the levels of Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs is love and belonging. OP could fulfill this need by going to pride and finding a supportive community. There\u2019s plenty of research on the role of social connections and community on people\u2019s physical and mental health; people need connections (in whatever way works for them) to not just survive but thrive. Social connection and communities also provide protective factors against things like self-harm and suicidal ideation (which is affects many trans people).\n\nEdit: Plus the bf mentioned that OP needs to find a group of friends and pride could potentially provide them the opportunity to do so",

Have you been to a pride event? If someone is so desperately in need of *that* level of belonging, it isn't going to happen at a street festival. OP needs to find consistent, long-term LGBTQ communities to be active in. Certainly that can happen at pride but realistically pride is a party and there are just so many better ways to go about that goal (and other types of pride events that I honestly think will be more worthwhile to finding support). Can we just be honest and admit that pride is an optional celebration? It really rubs me the wrong way to act like it's this great beacon of belonging where OP's life will improve tenfold simply being present.",

In my college town, pride is not a giant street festival where people are partying and getting rowdy. Streets are blocked off and there are vendors not just selling stuff but also advertising their groups (sexual health clinics, support groups, activist groups, future pride events). A small concert is put on and a family-friendly drag event (or at least one that is appropriate for teens OP\u2019s age). There are plenty of teens OP\u2019s age. I didn\u2019t make any friends because I wasn\u2019t actively seeking to do so, but another one of my friends made some of their friends through our town\u2019s pride event. All the partying for pride happens at night and at bars (and that when things get crazy lol). Idk where OP lives, but his local pride event might be more similar to mine\n\nFor me and my friends, I wouldn\u2019t consider pride a need. We found our community and support systems. I like to go to pride, but I\u2019ve missed the last two years since I\u2019ve had plans. Not a big deal to me. OP probably feels differently than me, especially with the anti-trans sentiment (if he lives in America).",

Most buses/trains I've been on (not many, tbf) everyone boards as quickly as possible but makes sure there's a spot for the disabled/elderly to sit. \n\nFWIW, in fully disabled and have been for a long time. If I'm that close to being unable to stand, I go to the front of the line and ask the first couple of people if I can board first or just make eye contact and gesture to the front of the line. You don't have eyes in the back of your head, you aren't responsible for knowing the age of people who are voluntarily forming a line behind you.\n\nThe other guy was out of line and I'm glad it didn't escalate. You always could've said to him, \"Now that I know this gentleman is waiting, he's welcome to board in front of me. (Turning to the elderly gent) Sir, you're welcome to board the bus first to find a seat.\" Makes family guy look like an aggressive idiot for blocking your way and gives the elderly guy a chance to board first. But, either way, you were perfectly fine and aren't an AH.",

Where I'm from there is no (and never has been) any expectation to prioritise the elderly except for specific areas of transport. And that is AFTER boarding, not before. There can be no AH behaviour when the expectation never existed.",

Everywhere I've been, I have seen people give up their seats on public transportation to others who needed them more. It's common courtesy. On some German trains they even play regular reminders over the info speakers for people to do that. It's not a law, but it's expected and encouraged. You can ignore it, but you'll probably learn to appreciate it when it's your turn to be on the receiving end.",

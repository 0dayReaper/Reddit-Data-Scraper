    "postText": "Maybe the better word is dumbass, but I don't think there's a thread for that.\n\n  \nI'm 21M in NYC. I am a film student interested in narrative films, mostly comedy and horror. I'm going into my senior year in August. My parents told me they'd be willing to cover rent for me to stay in New York for the summer and not come live at home if I was able to find an internship or a job in my field. This is incredibly generous of them, and I'm truly really grateful that I'm in a position where that's a possibility.\n\n  \nI only heard back from one job. It's a Fashion Photography internship at a studio nearby, but it is unpaid. They offered college credit, but I already have the credits necessary to graduate, and I'm more interested in getting something legitimate on my resume. My end goal is to get paid work in film after my senior year, regardless of what it is.\n\n  \nAfter a brief meeting with the owner of the studio, he offered me the job, and I accepted.It has been about a month, and whenever I go into the studio, the less legitimate this organization seems to me. The only person that works at the studio is the person who hired me; there are no other employees. He also lives there, which is not a bad thing, but it's not something I would expect. In addition to this, he sets up the shoots for a publication that he runs, so when I go in, I'm usually filming some models dressed in branded clothing and making workout videos for the publication's social media. He says that \"ideally he wants to get sponsorships,\" and these videos are proof of concept for how he can advertise these brands, but that leads me to wonder how and if the publication makes money in the first place. When there is a shoot, I set up the lights, I'm behind the camera (my own personal camera) and I go home and edit it. This is usually work that would require 3 paid people, and I'm doing all of it for free.  \nThe one incident that got my spidey senses tingling the most was during a meeting, where he said \"Eventually, the goal is that we \\[the publication\\] start making money.\"\n\n  \nDon't get me wrong, it doesn't feel like a scam; it just feels like I'm free skilled labor for his passion project. He's a very kind guy who's super fun to be around and he even cooks lunch for everybody occasionally, but it doesn't feel professional, which is the reason I took this job without pay.  \nI don't know what to do, because I don't feel like I'm gaining much other than a few connections, but they're not in the field in which I would like to work. I'm not learning anything because I'm doing work that I already know how to do; I'm just doing a lot more of it.\n\n  \nNow, I'm getting pretty close to broke and I just got a cashier job, but with the internship eating time and subway money, I can't decide whether it's worth it to stay for the resume content or just work on saving money. Because I don't have much experience yet, I'm unsure whether this internship will actually benefit me. WIBTA if I quit to focus on my paying job?",

Firstly, I have enough credits already with the classes I'm enrolled in for next semester, and secondly, in order to have the credits count, I would have to pay my university $1k PER credit, and ultimately it just wasn't worth it. I do think I'm getting some decent connections, but they're all fashion and beauty related which is not at all what I want to do. The only reason I'm on the fence is because this is my first film related job that isn't a university job or a peer's short film.",

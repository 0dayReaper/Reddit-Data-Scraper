But a coworker of mine asked what I was doing and I when I told her nothing she told me we had to do something. She told me to pick a place I wanted to eat and she\u2019d plan something. She then invited another coworker to join us (who Mia didn\u2019t really like). We went Olive Garden and then went Axe Throwing. \nMia texted me and asked what I was doing for my birthday and I told her I went out to eat and stuff and that we would do something later in the week. \nJohn and Mia were also friends and Snap back and forth sometimes. He send her a picture of me Axe Throwing and she asked if we were on a date and he said no that we were out with a few people. \nMia then stopped responding to John and I. Deleted the post about my birthday and stopped sharing her location. I then texted her that night and asked her what I did and asked her to talk so we could get down to the bottom of it and fix our problems. She never responded and left John on read anytime he\u2019d snap her. I decided to give her space and hasn\u2019t heard from her in 2 months. \nI texted her today to asked to talk and asked her if we were still friends. She then responded with \u201cidk are we\u201d and I told her I felt like she didn\u2019t want to be. She responded with \u201cand why do I feel that way\u201d I told her I didn\u2019t know why exactly and that\u2019s why I wanted to talk before. Now she\u2019s not responding. \nI\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t invite her but we\u2019ve never done anything for my birthday and she never asked to do anything. \nSo AITA?",

    "postText": "Since I (F24) was in my late teens, I was into hiking and prepping. I'm not crazy into it like on a conspirationist level, but I like to have in my bag or backpack some useful things. I carry everywhere my EDC (EveryDay Carry) set which contains: first aid kit, food (protein bars, chocolate and dried meat) and water, spare t-shirt and underwear, pocket knife, pepper spray (both spray and knife are perfectly legal in my country) and few other useful tools. It proved to be useful on many occasions and I always make sure to resupply this set and have it around me. It's a habit now and I feel really weird, almost like naked, without it.\n\nRecently my family had a big gathering during a barbecue. It was the firs gathering since I was a kid, so there were a lot of family members I barely or not at all knew. Obviously, I had my bag with me (and it happened to be useful as one of the kids burned themself and I had a hydrogel dressing on me). \n\nAnyway, one of my cousins asked if I have a spare pad, I said: \"Of course, here's my bag, it should be in  the middle pocket.\" Well, apparently she decided to rummage through my things instead of simply taking the pad. She saw my pocket knife and tools and freaked out. She basically started making a scene, accusing me that I probably want to attack someone or have other nefarious plans. It was enough for some older family members to be distraught (they sat long way from us and uderstood only that someone is about to attack us) and chaos ensued. Eventually it got under control, but the atmosphere was ruined. \n\nMy cousin and some family members say that I'm an asshole for bringing dangerous tools for a family gathering. They mostly have problem with my knife and pepper sprawy but say that all in all my EDC is \"weird and freakish and I shouldn't feel endangered in my own family\". I DON'T feel in danger, I just like being prepared. My parents (who obviously know about my habit) aren't mad but say that maybe I shouldn't carry my things among people as it may upset them or make them feel afraid.\n\nDunno if it's important but my bag wasn't military style - it was a normal woman's bag, one you can easily spot on the street. \n\nAITA?",

They aren't \"dangerous tools\"-they're simply items that you keep for emergencies, and you are wise to do so. I'm not a prepper in any way, but I keep the same type of items in my truck at all times because I am a woman who drives in a lot of rural areas, and you never know what you'll need if you are injured or stranded or attacked.",

I don't think op is an ah for carrying those items, however she should have just gotten the pad herself. I don't know about the pepper spray, but I have certainly set off aerosols in my hiking pack on accident which makes it an ESH for me.",

I have a bag for school trips, one that\u2019s stays on the boat, a car lot, and so on. Once, I was stranded in subzero weather when it was so cold my car wouldn\u2019t drive anymore.

I ignore them because I always need what I don\u2019t have, if I forget the bag. \n\n\nIf it helps, my supervisors actively encourage us to carry a bag like this in the event of an emergency. You never know when you\u2019re going to need it and it\u2019s better to have the emergency stuff there in case you need it. (I get hurt easily due to my medical issues and I am the only person in my family to carry a full first aid kit around. Thanks to work I have first aid training, too.)\n\n\nETA: I am sometimes the person making the safety calls at work.

If you didn't like her posts, you can mute them or even tell her that you appreciate being on her CF but don't feel comfortable with it. Instead you decided she was doing some sort of creepy incest move which honestly makes you sound like a creep.",

No. Because why in the WORLD would you show your sibling your sexy pics in the first place! It\u2019s not like she didn\u2019t know. You mentioned it and made jokes about it, and she kept posting the pics/kept you in the CF category. Why would you knowingly and intentionally show your SIBLING your sexy pics?!? Surely, she realizes this is weird, and is going to cause issues.",

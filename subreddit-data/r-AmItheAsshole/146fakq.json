    "postText": "I (22F) and my friend also (22F), and that I have known for 12 years, we\u2019re suppose to go together to a concert that she had paid for the both of us to go. Prior to going I was suppose to pay but I had spent my last bit of money on diapers for my toddler. My grandmother offered to pay so I could go in her place. I asked my friend what she would be more willing to do because we could potentially afford the seats closer to the stage. She wanted to go cheaper so I agreed to the seats farther away. Without telling me she was ordering the tickets she purchased the higher dollar tickets and I just shook it off and went with it. She asked me to pay later on whenever I could. (Keep this as a note for later)The day of the concert we had tried to discuss plans for attire and everything earlier in the day and then she brought up paying her back. It had only been 4 days, she knows I live on welfare because I don\u2019t have a choice, and I only get paid once every month and not very much. With all that being know she typically understood that I would pay her back when I could! In this case it was more urgent for her to get money back that I couldn\u2019t afford because again, I had spent all I had left on my toddlers diapers. With her knowing the circumstances she more aggressively kept persisting I needed to pay her back that night which she already knew I couldn\u2019t do. At that point trying to reason with her and explain how welfare systems work just wasn\u2019t going to work so instead of wasting time arguing the rest of the day I asked my grandmother if she would allow me to still go and if I could have money to get a t-shirt from the concert since it was my very first concert to ever go to. My grandmother agreed and I got my own ticket because I wasn\u2019t about to let the argument ruin my night. Showing up that night I had a great time and an entire row all to myself and it was great. My friend sat only a couple rows ahead of me with her boyfriend whom wasn\u2019t even interested in the concert. She wasn\u2019t happy either. The day after she texted me and started complaining how I lied about my finances and how dishonest I am and how I don\u2019t care about any of my friends etc. I tried multiple times to explain to her that I didn\u2019t pay for my shirt or my ticket and that my grandmother did, but she wouldn\u2019t listen. At that point I told her I needed space and we went completely quiet for months after she had blocked me on ever social media platform know to mankind! Am I The Asshole???",

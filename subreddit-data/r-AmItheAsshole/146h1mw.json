The beers and the tap orders for to go orders in particular. \n\n\nI serve the beer drinks Because I have a license to serve liquor and the sale is technically mine which my managers agree on but she\u2019s made a way bigger deal about it saying that I am stealing her tips.

I cover the bartenders lunches and that is the only time I make actual cocktails. \n\n\nShe\u2019s filed a grievance against me and my manager to the union because she says it\u2019s not fair that I\u2019m stealing her tips even though again we share tips.\n\nI was very hurt that she would file a complaint against me for something that\u2019s allowed as well as pretending she never filed it. \n\nI texted her saying that her actions were wicked in my eyes and that she chose money over our relationship and to never speak to me unless work related. \n\nNow I understand it\u2019s not very professional but I was so angry and hurt that I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. One of my managers gave me a slap on the wrist and told me she understood but just not to do it again. \n\nShe came in crying over said text and I just do not feel bad. She and I had a very mother/ daughter like relationship (she\u2019s 60) and she went behind my back. \n\n\nMy manager told me I could continue to serve beer and to leave the bar drinks to the bartender which I agreed. Bartender is still angry over the decision and I believe she\u2019s going to HR. \n\nAm I the asshole for sending her that message?",

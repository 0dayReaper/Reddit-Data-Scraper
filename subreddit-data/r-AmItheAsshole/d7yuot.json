OP didn't say she was \"okay\" with it, just because she was willing to flash her friend and her friend's boyfriend doesn't mean she was willing to be unknowingly exposed in public.  The fact that she sought revenge for it is a pretty strong indicator imo that she wasn't okay with it at all. Girl was pissed, and who can blame her?",

Your friend sucks for trying to publicly embarrass you with that bikini (assuming, of course, she knew how transparent it would turn in the first case - you haven't really said how you *knew* this was on purpose, yet), but you suck for flashing them for 30 minutes on purpose in a hot tub after a night of partying.\n\nBoth of these situations are about missing consent. I get it, the boyfriend probably enjoyed it and your friend will get over it, but in the end you flashed them for 30 minutes without their consent - which isn't cool.",

Of course typical male centric Reddit is saying not the asshole. But what you did was really disrespectful to your friend. If it was just the two of you it would\u2019ve been ok but since her boyfriend was over YTA and did it on purpose.",

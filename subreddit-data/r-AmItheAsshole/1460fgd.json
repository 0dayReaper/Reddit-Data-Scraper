    "postText": "\nI (M25) have been with my girlfriend (F26) for 4 years now.\n\nWe all have an attitude and are justified to get angry when our partners annoy us but I have always felt she has scorned me whenever I have annoyed her. \n\nIn the early days it was her giving me the silent treatment because I forgot to take out the bins, locking herself in her bedroom and ignoring me all day because a girl she didn\u2019t know liked my picture. \n\nAs we moved into our 2nd flat 2 years ago things were great and the thought of marriage began to appear. However over the last 2 months we have argued non stop.\n\nThe first argument I can remember when I felt like sh*t was when she made reservations at a nice restaurant but before we left was questioning whether to even go because she was worried it\u2019d be too packed around this time. As I hadn\u2019t been to the restaurant or the area before I just told her we could eat inside or find somewhere else if she didn\u2019t want to go anymore, she told me to decide as she couldn\u2019t make the decision herself so I told her it was fine we could go to another restaurant. \n\nAs we were walking to the train station to the other restaurant she then began to complain how she really wanted to go but we had now missed our reservation and it was all my fault, she stormed home after calling me a slur and telling me I ruined her night and give me the silent treatment all weekend.\n\nToday was the last straw, I was helping her set up her cameras for a photography shoot she was doing for a magazine that would\u2019ve got her nicely paid, especially with the fact she owes 2 months of rent and bills I have covered because she wasn\u2019t finding work, I assisted her photoshoot for free and cancelled plans last minute as she had gotten the booking 2 days ago because I wanted to help her so she wouldn\u2019t be paying a freelancer that would\u2019ve cut her profits.\n\nAs I was setting up her lighting I asked how many lights needed to go out and how long it would take to do test shots, I probably did sound tired as it was very hot but she replied with \u201cwhy don\u2019t you ever listen to me I told you how many lights we need five days ago!\u201d She then stormed off and told me I was going to ruin her big day and I was the reason she was failing as a photographer.\n\nI wanted to believe I was the problem so we could stop arguing and I asked what I could do to change, she admitted she was using me to release anger because she was stressed, and told me she would stop.\n\nI told her I couldn\u2019t carry on like this and wanted to go to couples therapy and asked her to look at therapist she wanted to preserve and develop our relationship back to what it was.\n\nShe stormed off and told me and told me I was overreacting. I want to be to problem so I can solve it myself but I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.",

If you have a strong internal locus of control, you assume stuff is down to you and you can fix it. Great for running a business, taking responsibility for your life, being proactive... and you seem like a strong confident person. But it also makes you vulnerable to abuse, because you think everything is down to you to fix, and if bad things happen it's your fault, and if you just learn what to do it'll all work... but the rules you're learning are constantly changing until you've shrunk to a tiny bonzaied shadow of a self, endlessly placating this person, still believing you can change the situation...\n\nYou can change the situation. But not the person. You need to get out. And actually you may well need help to get out, alien as that may seem to you. You've already told us what's going on. Tell your friends. Watch their faces. Take charge by asking for their help to extricate you. \n\nYou've been sucked into this BECAUSE you're strong and a fixer. Use that strength to get out. \n\nAsk me how I know...",

You deserve so much better. \n\nIt\u2019s not recommended to go to therapy with your abuser as they can easily turn the tables and manipulate the therapist and make you the bad guy. It\u2019s pretty common. She needs individual therapy and you need to leave, now, before it escalates.",

The automatic response is to shift the blame and leave decision-making to you so she doesn\u2019t feel guilty about doing anything wrong.\n\nShe\u2019s not flawed in that her experiences shaped her this way, and it\u2019s extremely painful for her to feel guilt/shame. Everything she\u2019s doing is just a response to that pain.\n\nTherapy is the solution here, but it\u2019ll be difficult. After finding a good therapist, it\u2019ll take years of at least weekly sessions to work out her shit.\n\nIf you put up with her for 4 years and neither of you did any work, she might provide something very valuable to you, or it might be your response to excessively take care of others at the cost of your own, which you should also work on with a therapist.\n\nIf you decide to give it a chance, you gotta have a serious talk with her and bring up therapy as the only way forward. Once she\u2019s in therapy, observe for a few months and see if there are small signs of improvement.",

But what I think will happen is If you break up with her, she will be desperate and agree to therapy. From there she will either cancel every appt or make excuses why that time/date doesn't work for her but she can say atleast she was 'willing' to try. Another manipulation tactic. Or if she actually makes it to one session, she will find reasons to not continue (the therapist doesn't like me, they therapist only agrees with you). I can see this happening a mile away.\n\nWhen or if you do break up with her, I think you'll need a plan to move your stuff out quickly because she will do everything in her power to continue to manipulate you. Try to stay at a friend's house and make a plan to take all your stuff out with a friend's help so you're not alone. \n\nGoodluck!",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\n\nI (M25) have been with my girlfriend (F26) for 4 years now.\n\nWe all have an attitude and are justified to get angry when our partners annoy us but I have always felt she has scorned me whenever I have annoyed her. \n\nIn the early days it was her giving me the silent treatment because I forgot to take out the bins, locking herself in her bedroom and ignoring me all day because a girl she didn\u2019t know liked my picture. \n\nAs we moved into our 2nd flat 2 years ago things were great and the thought of marriage began to appear. However over the last 2 months we have argued non stop.\n\nThe first argument I can remember when I felt like sh*t was when she made reservations at a nice restaurant but before we left was questioning whether to even go because she was worried it\u2019d be too packed around this time. As I hadn\u2019t been to the restaurant or the area before I just told her we could eat inside or find somewhere else if she didn\u2019t want to go anymore, she told me to decide as she couldn\u2019t make the decision herself so I told her it was fine we could go to another restaurant. \n\nAs we were walking to the train station to the other restaurant she then began to complain how she really wanted to go but we had now missed our reservation and it was all my fault, she stormed home after calling me a slur and telling me I ruined her night and give me the silent treatment all weekend.\n\nToday was the last straw, I was helping her set up her cameras for a photography shoot she was doing for a magazine that would\u2019ve got her nicely paid, especially with the fact she owes 2 months of rent and bills I have covered because she wasn\u2019t finding work, I assisted her photoshoot for free and cancelled plans last minute as she had gotten the booking 2 days ago because I wanted to help her so she wouldn\u2019t be paying a freelancer that would\u2019ve cut her profits.\n\nAs I was setting up her lighting I asked how many lights needed to go out and how long it would take to do test shots, I probably did sound tired as it was very hot but she replied with \u201cwhy don\u2019t you ever listen to me I told you how many lights we need five days ago!\u201d She then stormed off and told me I was going to ruin her big day and I was the reason she was failing as a photographer.\n\nI wanted to believe I was the problem so we could stop arguing and I asked what I could do to change, she admitted she was using me to release anger because she was stressed, and told me she would stop.\n\nI told her I couldn\u2019t carry on like this and wanted to go to couples therapy and asked her to look at therapist she wanted to preserve and develop our relationship back to what it was.\n\nShe stormed off and told me and told me I was overreacting. I want to be to problem so I can solve it myself but I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you start giving your parents money, you'll end up supporting your imprisoned sister with \"extras\", too.\n\nThey will come back to you time after time.\n\nDo you want to live with this unfair drain on your life? Imagine how you will be limited to a borderline poor life and what will happen to your dreams of home ownership, companionship, and perhaps a family one day?\n\nIn addition, I admire your choice to be a paramedic. However, you will need to live as stress free as possible in your private life to balance the stress of your career. You need to be good to yourself, to put yourself first.\n\nYour parents lost the moral high ground when they put your sister above the fortunes of the family and broke the law. They're not positive people anymore.\n\nI'm sorry, OP, it's hard, but I'd recommend that you protect your own life and lifestyle.\n\nBe strong!",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI'd like to know if I'm wrong for not wanting to pay off the court fines my parents have.\n\nMy sister is in prison. My parents also got into trouble because they helped her hide what she died and lied to the authorities. My dad served 90 days in prison and 20 months of probation. My mum served 180 days in prison and 17 months of probation. They also both have to pay a fine. Since helped my sister and are considered her associates they can't communicate with her while on probation or until their fines are paid. Once they pay the full amounts of the fine they can get a waiver. Right now my sister can mail them letters because she has no restrictions on who she can communicate with. But my parents can't right back. It can only be one way. Once my parents get the waiver they will be able to write her letters, talk to her on the phone once a week a visit her every week. But this can't happen until the fines are paid. Since my sister got arrested they were able to visit her once before they got arrested too. Right now my sister has no one visiting her.\n\nMy parents are in debt from my sister's legal fees and their legal fees. They owed more on their house than it sold for. Both my mum and dad were teachers but their convictions meant their lost their jobs and pensions and will never able to work as teachers again. They went through bankruptcy but not all debts were wiped away from that. They live in a small apartment and work low wages jobs and barely have any money.\n\nI didn't go to university but I still took classes to get certified for my job (paramedic). I'm about to be done paying the loans I took for those classes. My parents don't know the exact date but they know it's coming up. I was 18 when I signed the loan but I was 17 when I started looking into it. So my mum and dad have an idea of how long the payments would take. They could also estimate how much my rent and other bills are and would know that I make much more than my bills every month. My mum and dad have asked me to give them some money so they can pay off the fines and get the waiver. The amount they want is not all of the extra I have each month. So I can still save according to them. They also want my extra money from when I get paid 3 times in a month instead of 2 times. If I don't do this it'll be a long time before they can pay the fines.\n\nI know my parents are my only family besides my uncle but I feel my money is my own. Is that selfish like my parents claim? They want me to help them because I'm their daughter. I don't have a reason, I just don't want to and they aren't happy and are big time angry at me. They want me to change my mind.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Nobody has the right to spend your resources without your consent. \n\nYour sister and your parents presumably had a choice in their actions (although as parents, they may have thought their choices were more limited than they actually were). \n\nI think in your situation I might evaluate what crime my sister committed. If she hurt only herself, that's somewhat different than if she hurt others. I might be willing to help them pay their fines since they have so many other consequences too (the loss of their jobs, pensions, and licenses are really going to hurt them.) That way they can send letters back and forth to your sister and maintain contact with her. Being able to keep connections to family and friends help incarcerated people work towards a future outside of jail instead of it becoming a never-ending cycle.\n\nHowever, I would worry about being asked to provide endless money if I gave them anything.

    "postText": "For context, my dad has been married before marrying my mum and had two kids before me with that other lady. I have been told by my mum that they had a terrible marriage where she emotionally and verbally abused my dad before he finally divorced her when my siblings were I think around 5 and 6 I think (they are 8 and 9 years older than me), and my mum told him to never talk down about there mother as they love she unconditionally as it\u2019s there mother so I don\u2019t know if they know how big of a bitch their mum is. Well, recently my sister got engaged and like a week ago had an engagement party with her mum, our brother, his gf and all her fianc\u00e9\u2019s siblings and parents. But not us or even cousins on my mum's side they practically had grown up with. What I don\u2019t understand is that her mother after nearly 20 years after their divorce, I know was nasty she couldn\u2019t spend an hour with my dad to celebrate their daughter\u2019s engagement and I know I\u2019m going on a rant about my sibling's mum but my sister is a grown as a woman that can say to her mum no I want my dad, sister and step mum to be at the party. The thing we also found out on social media because she posted photos, and my dad sobbed because of her. The only thing more disappointing apart from getting to yell at my sister next weekend is my dad, mum, brother, and grandad and she is coming for a family dinner (edit sorry, it\u2019s not a set up just to yell at her or something like that like some people think). But the only time I will see the bitch of a mother will be at her wedding and I love my sister too much to ruin it by cussing out her mother. The only thing I don\u2019t know is if this is going overboard by telling her this with all our family present and that we are still going to her actual wedding we just didn\u2019t go to her little family celebration of it, and I\u2019m not even that mad about not going it was the fact she didn\u2019t invite our dad so WIBTA?",

At the end of the day, it's her decision. It's also your decision if you want to join or not, out of solidarity with your dad. But you can explain your point of view calmly to your sister about how hurt your dad was and maybe even the verbal abuse, without insulting her mom.",

Maybe the reason for excluding him was the the sister's mom lied abt how he was the abusive one in their relationship and how having him there would be hard for her.

Because it sounds like you weren't even born, and given the level of hatred you express for your sister's mum, I'm guessing there's been a lot of nasty talk about her.\n\nJust based on how you're talking, I'm going with YTA.

Despite what you own mother told you, it's not always so black and white, and there is likely a million things you don't know about it. \n\nIf you love your sister, as you say you do, calling her out and potentially humiliating her infront of other family members is not a nice thing to do at all. It's also very unlikely to work in your favor, and will damage your relationship. \n\nWhy not just call her and mention how hurt your Dad was, and suggest she call him?

And if their mom is as nasty as you\u2019re explaining, then they grew up with her saying that stuff to them all the time. It\u2019s really an unfortunate situation, and from just this side of the story it seems like she is in the wrong, but I really wonder what her side of the story is to get the whole picture. I do agree that you should address the situation, but you need to be mature about it and ask why y\u2019all weren\u2019t invited and let her know how much it hurt you.  Adults have conversations when there is a conflict; children yell with no rationale and don\u2019t understand there are two sides of a story.",

And again, if this is you're reaction to not going to an engagement party I think I know why your sister didn't invite you.\n\nHow many times in this post did you call her mum a bitch? If that's how you speak about her all the time then seriously, no wonder your sister didn't invite you. You're acting incredibly entitled and honestly, you're entire attitude is just cementing why I would 100% agree with your sister not inviting any of you.",

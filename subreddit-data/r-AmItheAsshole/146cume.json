    "postText": "I'm legit trying to figure out if I did something wrong here. I normally get literally all of my clothes from goodwill etc. I had to get a bunch of formal shirts today, so that was my first time actually even walking into a normal clothing store in probably a decade or so. I tried on a couple of button-downs, found my size, then went to where they were folded on a shelf, picked a couple more in my size in different colors, went to the huge mirror and sort of put them against my chest to see how they look. \n\nThe guy working the floor kept giving me the stink eye and then got up to me and told me not to mess with them because he has to fold them, and take them to the fitting room? At least I think that's what he told me, his English was quite poor. He was also pointing quite aggressively at another shelf in the back where they were stacked vertically, I guess I was meant to take them from there?\n\nThat's what the shelf I took them from looked like: [https://st3.depositphotos.com/11119270/14598/i/1600/depositphotos\\_145986527-stock-photo-clothing-store-in-shopping-mall.jpg](https://st3.depositphotos.com/11119270/14598/i/1600/depositphotos_145986527-stock-photo-clothing-store-in-shopping-mall.jpg)\n\nI've never worked retail so I'm really confused? Did he want me to take them to the fitting room because they're going to fold it there? Was I meant to fold them back myself? (I did, but admittedly not too well). Did I commit some unspoken Clothes Shopping faux pas that has eluded me until then? I feel kinda bad now",

HOWEVER, every store we've gone to never had a \"trial size\" shirt in my husband's size available even though they had PLENTY of those sizes folded up. So, he tried the folded ones on anyway and ignored the salesperson's complaint. It's literally a matter of \"let us try this on and had the potential of making a sale\" or don't let us try this on and you will definitely NOT make a sale. These people often receive commission in the formalwear departments. You'd think they'd want the sale!",

However, as a shopper, you take one shirt from the pile that is your approximate size and unfold it to see what it looks like. Hold it up against you. Decide if you're correct in your sizing and/or if you want to go to the next step and try the shirt on. Then put it down and the staff folds it back perfectly as it is depicted in the picture. Sometimes you unfold 2-3 shirts because you were wrong about your size or because you want to check a different color against your skin tone. \n\nSo... this depends on INFO: were you unfolding like 20 shirts or were you unfolding a few?\n\nIt is the staff member's job to refold the shirts once you've unfolded them. It's an annoying thing to do, but it's literally part of his job.",

They don't want to refold the shirts, so they get pissy if you try them on. But formal, fitted clothing NEEDS to be tried on. I personally think those areas of the store are staffed by the laziest workers on purpose because fewer people patronize those areas regularly and therefore in a given day they have less work to do. That's just my experience shopping with my husband. I've never had a good experience with the sales staff in those sections of a store.",

They will also check to see if the clothing got soiled when tried on (e.g., if it landed on the dressing room floor, which was wet from melting snow from boots in the winter) and also spray with fabric refresher if needed, or using the steam machine to get wrinkles out of clothing if needed.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone goes picking through displays unfolding things and shuffling them apart, the whole thing needs to be reorganized.  A properly done shelf display will have clothes sorted by style, color/print, and then stacked in sizes from largest on bottom and smallest on top.\n\nIt's much more time consuming to do a whole display that's been scrambled than it is to return folded, sorted clothes to the correct spot in a well-organized display.\n\nI wouldn't call it AH if you actually bought the things you took from the display - no one has to re-shelve them.  But if he has to watch to be sure you don't put them on the wrong display, or leave them badly folded, or just on a bench near the mirror you used, it's making work, and inefficient work at that. \n\nAlso, even if they are the same size and style, there is sometimes variation in how a garment fits - the cutting and sewing are not always absolutely identical, as many pieces are cut from a stack of fabric at once, and many people work at sewing the garments.  So trying on each garment, rather than assuming that if one fits, all will, can help you avoid a return trip to exchange something which doesn't fit despite being labeled the same size/style, or which has a flaw in the sewing.",

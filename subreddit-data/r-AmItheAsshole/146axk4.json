    "postText": "Me(32f) and my wife(32f) had my BIL(28m) and his girlfriend over for dinner for the first time last night. We \"officially\" met her 3 weeks ago at a restaurant for dinner with all my ILs.  \n\nI'm not gonna go into much detail but my wife has sight impariments, we just recently found out the actually issue, it's a very complex thing with no \"easy\" fix(like glasses or surgery), and not the common thing doctors have been saying it was since she was a toddler.  \n\nThis is an extremly sensitive subject for her, as it has made her reliant in other people for many things, she has open up about it a lot in recent years to try and find a solution, but she doesn't talk to strangers about it.  \n\nSo we were having dinner, I knewn the GF was a bit nervous, I was too, I'm certainty not a very social person.  \n\nWe were talking about work, then she said she noticed there was a \"do not contact\" pin in the office calendar for next thursday, all day, and what was I going to do all day. I was a bit uncomfortable because regardless of what it is it's a personal matter. Wife answered she has a very impotant audition that day(she's a musician) and I was taking her.  \n\nGF asked why, we have 2 cars where's the need for me to drive her to the audition, I can feel my wife getting quite uncomfortable next to me as she tells GF she can't drive. GF asked again why, and BIL starts going into way to much detail about the whole thing, GF asks if that's why I was reading to my wife the menu at the restaurant and suggesting things for her to eat the other day because she thought it was odd and controlling at first, and what else does my wife needs assistance with.  \n\nI could see my wife consealing her distress, I was fuming, they were crossing a line, so I asked them as politely as I could to leave, but they kinda laugh it off, so I repeated myself a bit less kindly. They told me to \"chill\" and that they were just talking. My wife excuses herself to go to the kitchen, but I saw her walk pass the kitchen.  \n\nI basically went off on them for their topic of conversation and I ended yelling at them to leave, and they finally did. Wife went to bed early and stayed there way more than usual this morning.  \n\nI got texts from BIL about how inappropiate I was by yelling at them, especially considering our power dynamic at work, SIL is on my side, other BIL can see both sides(including GF's \"curiosity\" and nerves), my mom said I shouldn't have done anything. AITA? they were talking about personal matters that had nothing to do with them, and commenting on her dependance on me. I think that was extremely inappropriate.\n\nEdit: I did tried to change the subject of the conversation, but somehow she managed to find questions regarding the sight issue and the random things I said. BIL knows very well the subject is sensitive, I was surprised he even brought it up himself in front of her sister and talked so freely about it. I'm the boss of GF's boss and BIL said a shouldn't talk like that to a subordinate.\n\nEdit: I don't know if you can see this, but I was just informed that Reddit is banning me from posting and commenting in AITA because a made a comment expresing the anger I feel right now towards BIL, I apologize for that comment, so I won't be able to directly anwser more questions.",

Vision impairments and partial blindness aren\u2019t uncommon disabilities.

Had you ever met her before she started dating your BIL? \n\nIt really depends on the flow of the conversation at your prior meeting and then at this one as well though. Like if she was demanding answers \u201cwhy don\u2019t you drive?! That\u2019s so weird!\u201d Or something, she was very rude. But there\u2019s also a version of these questions she could be asking out of genuine curiosity and trying to get to know you all more? Trying to start conversation? She felt awkward about the dinner, clearly, and she was looking for some way to just chat. Maybe it wasn\u2019t totally appropriate to bring up your work calendar but I think that maybe your wife learning to be a bit more okay with sharing this information (especially because people, at least those in your family, are going to ask when she\u2019s being driven everywhere, and having menus read to her). Your BIL probably should have addressed with her privately after the first family meal and then told her not to bring it up. He didn\u2019t. Whatever. \n\nIdk. This is hard. I think you need to really reflect on the overall tone of the evening and her questions. Was she interrogating your wife? Or was she trying to keep conversation going and walked into a territory she didn\u2019t know was dicey? It also sounds like you guys just kicked them out before really trying to redirect or politely say \u201cshe doesn\u2019t really like talking about it, let\u2019s move on.\u201d",

So for that reason I personally would have tried something other than kicking them out.

We \"officially\" met her 3 weeks ago at a restaurant for dinner with all my ILs.  \nI'm not gonna go into much detail but my wife has sight impariments, we just recently found out the actually issue, it's a very complex thing with no \"easy\" fix(like glasses or surgery), and not the common thing doctors have been saying it was since she was a toddler.  \nThis is an extremly sensitive subject for her, as it has made her reliant in other people for many things, she has open up about it a lot in recent years to try and find a solution, but she doesn't talk to strangers about it.  \nSo we were having dinner, I knewn the GF was a bit nervous, I was too, I'm certainty not a very social person.  \nWe were talking about work, then she said whe noticed there was a \"do not contact\" pin in the office calendar for next thursday, all day, and what was I going to do all day. I was a bit uncomfortable because regardless of what it is it's a personal matter. Wife answered she has a very impotant audition that day(she's a musician) and I was taking her.  \nGF asked why, we have 2 cars where's the need for me, I can feel my wife getting quite uncomfortable next to me as she tells GF she can't drive. GF asked again why, and BIL starts going into way to much detail about the whole thing, GF asks if that's why I was reading the menu at the restaurant the other day because she thought it was odd and controlling at first, and what else does my wife needs assistance with.  \nI could see my wife consealing her distress, I was fuming, they were crossing a line, so I asked them as politely as I could to leave, but they kinda laugh it off, so I repeated myself a bit less kindly. They told me to \"chill\" and that they were just talking. My wife excuses herself to go to the kitchen, but I saw her walk pass the kitchen.  \nI basically went off on them for their topic of conversation and I ended yelling at them to leave, and they finally did. Wife went to bed early and stayed there way more than usual this morning.  \nI got texts from BIL about how inappropiate I was by yelling at them, especially considering our power dynamic at work, SIL is on my side, other BIL can see both sides(including GF's \"curiosity\" and nerves), my mom said I shouldn't have done anything. AITA? they were talking about personal matters that had nothing to do with them, and commenting on her dependance on me. I think that was extremely inappropriate.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Anyone saying she needs to be less sensitive needs to learn some empathy. \n\n\nBIL is the biggest AH. He was in the best position to defuse the situation and he made it worse. I choose to attribute the gf's actions as ignorance rather than malice because I'm an optimist. and I think OP could have done a better job at defusal, but was def put in a really bad position by BIL.",

Recently found out that my diagnosis is actually more than what we thought initially and is far more complex. I have had multiple surgeries and now it seems there is actually nothing that can be done. I dread my vision getting worse. I can\u2019t drive, I don\u2019t have much depth perception, I have all sorts of strange things that the average person won\u2019t get. The change in diagnosis has hit me hard because it means it will never get better. And it can get worse. Everything is harder because I can\u2019t drive. \n\nThe GF questions were beyond rude and prying. I see this in people who ask me questions. Some people it\u2019s out of kindness and wanting to understand, but for a lot of people it\u2019s because they\u2019re fascinated and you become an object. A freak show where they want me to describe exactly what I see and how it affects me and wow how weird is that!  You can hear it in tone, you can tell in persistence. \n\nThen the BIL answering for your wife is extremely rude. He knew better. And him answering removed her autonomy. No wonder your wife needed to excuse herself!\n\nThe gf started in the wrong foot by snooping in your work calendar when she had no reason to (and had no shame in doing so). She continued being a nosey Nelly when your answers weren\u2019t good enough and kept asking for more details and telling you essentially that your answers weren\u2019t good enough.\n\nAnd people telling you you shouldn\u2019t have (ie the mom) are putting the gf\u2019s feelings ahead of your WIFE\u2019S. So either they don\u2019t care about her and care more about the brother or this is just another example where she\u2019s expected to not make waves to be polite even if she\u2019s uncomfortable. Fuck that. Make waves. \n\nYou absolutely did the right thing. \n\nI hope your wife feels supported by you and sees that you care and clearly love her. I hope her vision is something that won\u2019t get worse. I know I live in fear of this myself and worry I won\u2019t be able to read sheet music (cello!), or sew again. I\u2019m sure she has many deep worries about it too. Sending her warm thoughts.",

    "postText": "I (m19) frequently look after my two cousins (f12) and (f10) when my aunt &amp; uncle are out or busy. The two girls fight a lot, like all sisters I guess, but I can usually ease the tension whenever they have a conflict. A few days ago though, there seemed to be more going on. The older cousin called the younger one a lot of horrible names and slurs, and I immediately told her to cut it out. But just a few minutes later, she\u2019d continue and say even meaner things (I was actually shocked by the vocabulary of a 12 year old). From my perspective, the younger one did nothing to provoke that behaviour.\n\n\r  \nI had initially promised them that we would go to the movies but I told my older cousin that she couldn\u2019t come along if she wouldn\u2019t stop this behaviour right now. But again, it didn\u2019t take much time and she kicked her younger sister, which made her fall to the ground. I told the older one that we would go to the movies without her and that she should think about her behaviour. \n\n\r  \nOn the way, I texted my uncle and told him about what happened and he just told me that they\u2019d been fighting a lot more lately and that it was cool if I only took the younger one to the movies because they lately had to ground the older one several times. \n\nBut when we came back from the movies, my aunt had come back home and was furious with me. She said that I couldn\u2019t just leave one of her kids alone  and that I shouldn\u2019t come over to babysit anymore.\n\n\r  \nI find it unreasonable, because I checked with her husband before I left the property and I\u2019m also not babysitting (they don\u2019t pay me) but just spend time with my family.\n\n\r  \nAITA for leaving my cousin alone? Or AITA for not checking with both parents?\r  \n",

You'll go make some money doing something else or just enjoy your free time.  She can stay home with her kids or pay a sitter.  It's not really that much of a threat if they're not paying you.",

It sucks that things have changed, becoming more of a hassle, but you made a commitment to the group and they are counting on you (I realize there are understudies, but still). You didn't know that it would end up this way. \n\nAnd you suggested an alternative, taking the multiple buses and walking, so that your grandparents wouldn't have to drive you (though they declined that suggestion). You're trying to make it work for everybody, it sounds like. and aholes don't do that.",

At that age, ahead of college and university, they should be fostering your interests.\n\nI would break the silence and explain to them that you understand the inconvenience, and you're super grateful and appreciative of the support they've given you. Mention the show is in a few weeks and after, the time commitment will drop off and you can resume getting yourself there. Also, that after this show, you'll  consider going for smaller parts with  less committement in the future to minimize the load on them. OR just plan on getting yourself there.\n\nI actually hope that you having that conversation with them, causes them to see the light, get their heads out of their butts, and shows them they need to support you!\n\nEdit: all the spelling and grammar.",

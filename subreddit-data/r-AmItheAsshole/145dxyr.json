    "postText": "It was my (27f) birthday a week ago. My husband planned a dinner date to celebrate on the day of my birthday. I had told him previously that that was exactly how I preferred spending my birthday. I didn\u2019t need any real gifts, just a nice dinner date. I\u2019ve also previously asked him to plan more dates for us since it\u2019s a good way for him to make me feel loved, cared for, and heard (I\u2019m usually the one who has to plan dates and find new restaurants, and sometimes I\u2019d like for that to be done for me). We didn\u2019t really have the whole day since we both work, but I was excited to have a nice evening together, especially since this was the first birthday we were going to celebrate as husband and wife (I\u2019m a pretty sentimental person and love commemorating special days). \n\nThe problem occurred when I got a phone call from my MIL and told me she and my husband\u2019s family were going to be coming over on the evening of my birthday. I told her that my husband and I had plans that evening and she said \u201cOh, I already talked to him and he said he\u2019ll move the dinner reservation to a different day.\u201d \n\nNow here\u2019s where I felt extremely hurt. I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve asked my husband to talk to me before changing our plans or creating boundaries between his family and us (because I\u2019ve created boundaries between my family and us), but it just doesn\u2019t seem to get through to him. I\u2019ve cried, I\u2019ve yelled, I\u2019ve asked calmly. I\u2019ve told him how much it hurts my feelings, I\u2019ve told him it makes me unhappy. And each time he says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you, I\u2019ll do better next time.\u201d But I\u2019ve heard that from him on at least 15 different occasions and I haven\u2019t seen much change. Not to mention how many times I\u2019ve asked him to discuss with me if plans are being changed. \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t mind celebrating my birthday with my in-laws. They\u2019re great people and I actually love them. But that doesn\u2019t mean that I prefer that over a romantic dinner date with my husband. I would\u2019ve been happy celebrating with them on another day. But I didn\u2019t even get to have a say in how I wanted to celebrate my birthday. My husband changed our plans because his mom asked him to and he didn\u2019t discuss it with me at all. It just hurts me that he can\u2019t seem to do what I\u2019ve asked of him. \n\nI spoke to him about it and he claimed, \u201cyou don\u2019t know my mom, she\u2019s really difficult and stubborn. She wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer.\u201d I asked him if he made it clear to his mom how important this dinner date was to us and he shrugged and said that he hadn\u2019t really thought to do that. Which of course makes me think he didn\u2019t really think the dinner date was important. \n\nMy husband can\u2019t seem to keep his promises. Im not sure if I\u2019m being unreasonably angry at him. I\u2019ve told him in the past that he\u2019s going to slowly lose me if he can\u2019t keep his promises. Am I being dramatic over the fact that I had to spend my birthday with my in-laws? AITA?\n\nEDIT: I told my husband I have one foot out the door. He keeps asking me for one more chance, but he wants me to work with him on it. He told me marriage is a team effort. I scoffed and said, marriage is also about keeping your promises to each other. I told him I\u2019ve done my part this entire relationship by communicating my needs, now it\u2019s on him to fix this relationship. He\u2019s expecting me to be my normal happy self again, but I told him he\u2019s not entitled to that. He has to earn my trust and love back, and I have zero reason to make that my responsibility. He doesn\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t believe his promises this time. He says he always \u201ctries\u201d to keep his promises and I said that\u2019s never good enough. He\u2019s upset that Im not moving on from this argument and working on fixing this for us. Im beyond frustrated with him. I can\u2019t seem to get it through to him why I don\u2019t trust his promises anymore, yet he wants credit for trying.",

Your husband is fine with hurting you OP, as long as he doesn't need to disappoint his mother. Maybe try couple therapy? If it requires an outsider to tell your husband he's currently putting his relationship with his mother over his marriage with you, that might, just might help him to open his eyes that this is not the right thing to you.\nOP, you deserve all that affection you've asked, it's not too much, it's not being overreacting to cry when your feelings get shrugged off. Your husband indeed might lose you if he continues like that. Even if you don't leave him, emotionally he's pushing you away.",

Tell him that will make him very uncomfortable and you don't want that for him, but that he is married now, and that there are times where you and his mom will want different things at the same time. He needs to figure out how to make you happy and understand that this might mean letting his mom down. If she's truly a good person, she will understand and yield this to you. \n\nI firmly believe in \"I deal with my family so you don't have to\" policies, but sometimes people have to stand up to the other person's family for their own sanity. I don't know if you are there yet. I hope you don't have to do this.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nIt was my (27f) birthday a week ago. My husband planned a dinner date to celebrate on the day of my birthday. I had told him previously that that was exactly how I preferred spending my birthday. I didn\u2019t need any real gifts, just a nice dinner date. I\u2019ve also previously asked him to plan more dates for us since it\u2019s a good way for him to make me feel loved, cared for, and heard (I\u2019m usually the one who has to plan dates and find new restaurants, and sometimes I\u2019d like for that to be done for me). We didn\u2019t really have the whole day since we both work, but I was excited to have a nice evening together, especially since this was the first birthday we were going to celebrate as husband and wife (I\u2019m a pretty sentimental person and love commemorating special days). \n\nThe problem occurred when I got a phone call from my MIL and told me she and my husband\u2019s family were going to be coming over on the evening of my birthday. I told her that my husband and I had plans that evening and she said \u201cOh, I already talked to him and he said he\u2019ll move the dinner reservation to a different day.\u201d \n\nNow here\u2019s where I felt extremely hurt. I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve asked my husband to talk to me before changing our plans or creating boundaries between his family and us (because I\u2019ve created boundaries between my family and us), but it just doesn\u2019t seem to get through to him. I\u2019ve cried, I\u2019ve yelled, I\u2019ve asked calmly. I\u2019ve told him how much it hurts my feelings, I\u2019ve told him it makes me unhappy. And each time he says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you, I\u2019ll do better next time.\u201d But I\u2019ve heard that from him on at least 15 different occasions and I haven\u2019t seen much change. Not to mention how many times I\u2019ve asked him to discuss with me if plans are being changed. \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t mind celebrating my birthday with my in-laws. They\u2019re great people and I actually love them. But that doesn\u2019t mean that I prefer that over a romantic dinner date with my husband. I would\u2019ve been happy celebrating with them on another day. But I didn\u2019t even get to have a say in how I wanted to celebrate my birthday. My husband changed our plans because his mom asked him to and he didn\u2019t discuss it with me at all. It just hurts me that he can\u2019t seem to do what I\u2019ve asked of him. \n\nI spoke to him about it and he claimed, \u201cyou don\u2019t know my mom, she\u2019s really difficult and stubborn. She wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer.\u201d I asked him if he made it clear to his mom how important this dinner date was to us and he shrugged and said that he hadn\u2019t really thought to do that. Which of course makes me think he didn\u2019t really think the dinner date was important. \n\nMy husband can\u2019t seem to keep his promises. Im not sure if I\u2019m being unreasonably angry at him. I\u2019ve told him in the past that he\u2019s going to slowly lose me if he can\u2019t keep his promises. Am I being dramatic over the fact that I had to spend my birthday with my in-laws? AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

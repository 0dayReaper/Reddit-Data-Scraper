This was because I had gone home in a rush [my tuition takes place in a seperate building] and left my tiffin box outside of the tuition building but still in view of my teacher. There were other students with me btw. so once I came back, \n\nSir [idk if he was joking or serious] said that he ate my lunch. Now me, being the idiot that I am, asked my Sir for money after class. He told me that a cat had knocked my food to the ground. Nobody ate it.\n\nI know it was disrespectful to ask money because Sir is much older than me, but at the same time.. The tuition was from 1:30 in the afternoon to 9:00 in the night. That was the only meal I might have had during the day before reaching home.\n\nAm I the Asshole?",

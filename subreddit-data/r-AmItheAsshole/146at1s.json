    "postText": "For a little background, I'm an 18-year-old college student, with multiple diagnosed mental disorders. I do not think naming them is important, but it is an important piece of the story.\n\nStarting on my side,  I have a pretty good handle on dealing with the issues I suffer from, at least I have come a long way from when I was younger. I had top surgery in January, currently I am enrolled in college for the summer, recently got my permit and am returning to work after a bit of time. I landed a job interview and got hired a few days ago. Today was my orientation, took a bus, It took me more than halfway there, got to walking and ended up having to cross a 6-way interlane. (I had tried to reroute my GPS or find another bus route but nothing) No crosswalks, or bikeway to walk safely on. Now, I am aware that cars legally cannot hit a pedestrian, but that didn't stop my anxiety from throwing red flags at me and giving me the no-no from passing through it. I am sure others have done so with no problem, but it was a hard obstacle for me.\n\nSo, I called my mom and explained the situation to her. I had about 20 minutes before my orientation and was panicking around this time. She was adamant on getting me to walk through it, I attempted to do so on facetime with her and failed miserably. The whole time I was trying I had her screaming in my ear and basically belittling me. That did not help, and I gave up and returned to my original position.\n\nI ended up scumming to my anxiety and turning back around, now, another important part of this is my mom does not approve of my relationship with my boyfriend, she says he enables my disorders and babies me too much, and that he is the reason behind my increased anxiety. The way I process things, he is a big part of my motivation for improving my life, and I was basically a shut-in before I met him. I feel my anxiety is from me becoming an adult recently, my anxiety as always been like this even before I met him. \n\nAfter everything settled, while I was still trying to find my way home, my mom called me and told me that she is tired of babying me, and that I need to man up and stop using my illnesses as an excuse for everything. She told me that it's either my boyfriends house or hers, and that If I come home, I am grounded, and she is taking my phone and she will treat me like a child from now on. So, naturally, I DID NOT want to be in that environment and at that point I wanted to just get out of the heat, so I got help from my boyfriend's mom and am currently camped at his house till the water settles.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not crossing the intersection and ignoring their advice, or is my mom the asshole for threatening to ground me and take my phone?",

You are an adult now.  That is on you. Perhaps because of your mental illness, but again that doesn\u2019t really matter.  You are the one stuck with the consequence.  You need to figure out how to get what you need without your mom.",

I could never imagine my child calling me in a time where she's distressed and I belittle her. You're 18 and she wants to treat you like kid with grounding you and taking your phone but doesn't want to baby you? I'm a little confused by that.",

I didn't mean to speak out of term if you felt I was attacking your mom's choices but felt like it needed to be said because I know how its impacted me over the years of feeling like I failed my mom because of her choices of words she used to say to me. Similar to your mom, anxiety and lack of control with her volume :)\nIf you and your boyfriend are happy and comfortable with the amount of support he gives you then I hope your mom can realise she's blessed to have another person in your life who loves you so much :) \n\nI hope you and your mom sort things out soon. Maybe ask her for a talk over coffee and take some cake to ease the tension. Everyone loves cake :)",

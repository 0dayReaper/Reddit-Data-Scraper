    "postText": "My nephews both graduated from high school this morning and I wanted to sit up front so I camped out a bit in front of the entrance. I brought my folding camping chair and my headphones to listen to my show.\n\nAbout 40 minutes before the school would let us inside, a pregnant woman got next to me since somebody let her in line (I assume her partner). She asked me within 5 minutes (politely admittedly) if she could have my chair as she was going to have trouble standing the whole time. I said no, sorry I need it more (bad feet/knees) and went back to my things. She asked me again within 2 minutes and the answer was the same. She however got a little mad at me and said that she was going to be struggling the whole time and asked her partner to tell me. He asked me himself (politely) and I again responded that sorry but I need it more and suggested she could wait in their car or just sit in the ground. At this point the husband directly called me an asshole but left me alone\n\nAita",

The thing is, society is already below replacement levels of fertility and it's only going to cause more and more problems due to demographics (aka boomers retiring). The harder we as a society make it for people to have and raise children, the worse the problems will get. It's been a saying for milennia that it takes a village to raise a child and some basic compassion is often enough all that's needed.\n\nNot in the case of OP though, that was a clear lack of planning by the parents.",

She gave us a pen to use to get signatures.\n\nWhile we're waiting, this guy came up to me and said that that was his pen. I said no it's not. He said yeah, the lady gave it to me. I said I got it from her too. \n\nThen he starts yelling to the people standing around, \"THIS GUY HAS MY PEN! THIS GUY STOLE MY PEN!!\" The people didn't care.\n\nLater, the woman arrived to get her pens back, and I asked her to confirm to him that she had loaned me the pen, which she told him she had. He just stood there with a stupid look on his face. Didn't apologize or anything.",

I think the ratio of entitled pregnant women, bridezillas and Karens is equal to the ratio of entitled people in the general population. \n\nI\u2019ve lived in small towns, small cities and big cities in the US and Europe. I\u2019ve traveled beyond that. No pregnant woman has ever demanded anything from me. When I\u2019ve offered things (like my seat on the subway) to a pregnant woman, they usually protested a little before bashfully accepting.\n\nI mean, to give benefit of the doubt, if you work a job that entails working with a lot of pregnant people, eventually you\u2019ll have some negative experiences\u2026but probably not disproportionately compared to the behavior of the general population.",

Never once did I ask someone to give up their seat, chair, or anything. \n\nWe weren\u2019t allowed to sit at work for very long even though we had chairs. Did I expect special accommodation? Nope. We also had to walk around the store to talk to customers. I did not one time say \u201cI can\u2019t do this activity\u201d. Eventually, the big wigs came to visit and noticed I was wearing house shoes. I was huge at that point and that was the only accommodation I took because feet wouldn\u2019t fit into shoes due to swelling from being on them constantly while pregnant.\n\nWhen I was asked about the house shoes, I explained that my feet were so swollen, I couldn\u2019t fit into any shoes and I slid my foot out to show her why they wouldn\u2019t fit shoes. Her eyes got huge and she immediately told me to sit down and put my feet up. Then she got onto my coworkers and direct boss for having me on my feet all day and making me walk around the store to talk to customers. She told me I had a medical reason to need to sit down and skip the walking every 30 minutes. \n\nI was so unentitled while pregnant I didn\u2019t even ask for accommodations that were reasonable. I could not imagine demanding someone else\u2019s chair.",

They should have been concerned and shown some basic decency toward me but didn\u2019t. Everyone in that branch was very young and selfish. They wouldn\u2019t even try to accommodate me for lunch. They would make appointments and not warn me so I could eat early. They would just leave me there to cover them until 2-3pm. I was more pissed off about that than anything else. I learned quickly to just eat at 10am just in case they started bailing at 11 for their nail appointments. \n\nBut it wasn\u2019t some retail job. I was in banking and part of making it into management was working a branch inside of a grocery store. It was a pit stop along the way to a much higher paid position. This was back in the early 2000s when it was a little easier for companies to punish women for being pregnant. I was placed on the fast track to management and found out I was pregnant a week later. I was terrified it would cost me a management position. There was a reason I was pushing myself. It still wasn\u2019t worth it, but at least I was paid a little better than retail and the promotion after all the hard work made it a means to end for me. I was single and on my own so I desperately needed the promotion to make enough money to support myself and unborn children. \n\nOn the bright side, my hard work and determination were recognized and I was promoted upon returning from maternity leave. They called me about a week before I was due to return and told me I\u2019d be coming back to a different branch and I\u2019d be the manager. Like I said, it wasn\u2019t worth it in the long run but it felt worth it at the time due to my fears of what would happen if I didn\u2019t push myself. I was still young and in my mind, invincible. \u201cNothing seriously bad is going to happen to my babies or me, I just need to suck it up and push myself\u201d. I did what I had to do at the time to set myself up to have the means to support my family.",

And I had what I would consider an easy pregnancy where I could remain physically active for a long time.  \n\n\nThankfully I had one person who would go to bat for me at my job for the most ridiculous shit.  No, she can\u2019t take a lunch break 7.5 hours into an 8 hour shift.  No, she shouldn\u2019t be parking in the satellite parking and darting across a busy highway with no crosswalk.  No, she will not be working with the I131 cat/brucellosis case/chemotherapy.  She needs a seat and can no longer use a standing desk.  No, I don\u2019t think she should be working up to her due date when we are an hour away from her birth place.  \n\n\nIn the general public I could at least limit going out but I still remember the time someone actively closed a door in my face at the UPS store as I was going to return a large box.  Like bad enough that the person at the counter said something.  No one ever offered me a seat or their spot in line why would I even think to ask for a strangers chair.  I\u2019m so glad that my husband, neighbors, boss and medical team were good to me because no one else was willing to even be kind.  And then I come on here and see commenters who were probably closing the door in my face at the store, which for reference you shouldn\u2019t do to anybody.",

There tends to be a very strong backlash to people who use an optional condition to gain things they have no right to.\n\nIf this was a guy with dick stuck in a jar, people would be putting him down for being a \"horn dog\" who stuck it where he stuck it. It's not that she's pregnant, it's that she chose to be pregnant and chose to make her pregnancy someone else's problem. She could have chose to wait in her car longer. She could have chosen to bring her own chair. She could have chosen the man that got her pregnant to give her his chair.\n\nShe had no right to expect a chair from a complete stranger and it's gross she used her pregnancy to try and take someone else's property.",

But where y\u2019all are taking to too far is deducing pregnant women to a choice that they made as if they are solely responsible for their condition. Forgetting as well that many women do not have a choice in the matter today with the reversal of reproductive rights in the largest superpower country in the world. Pregnancy is absolutely a fragile and disabling condition. It is the most dangerous point in many women\u2019s lives not only medically but also when they are most likely to be abused or killed. \n\nPregnant people will always exist unless we are calling for the extinction of humanity. Stripping away pregnancy from a woman\u2019s plight and their unequal standing in society is a narrow minded naive stance at best and hateful at worst. It is not that hard to find empathy for people who are going through something like pregnancy, yet many of you are so easily able to hate pregnant women instead of looking empathetically or even dissecting the view from a wider approach of societal norms, discourses and real life power/oppression logics. \n\nI will never be pregnant but I have loved enough pregnant people to have empathy for them. \n\nThis woman was entitled, but that does not mean you should openly hate pregnant people. It\u2019s absurd and so short sighted.",

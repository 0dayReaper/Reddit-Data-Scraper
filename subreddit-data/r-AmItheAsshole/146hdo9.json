    "postText": "My friend (22f) and i (22f) have been friends for 20 years. We use to be best friends but with how little we talk or know about each other i really wouldn\u2019t call us that anymore. 2 weeks ago i told her that i could afford to drive the 3 hours back to our home town to be able to go to her graduation party, that she didn\u2019t tell me about until a month ago. I told her that i had a concert to go to at the end of the month and is been planning to go to that for a year and that i couldn\u2019t even afford that, i have to pick up a bunch of extra shifts to be able to afford to go. She didn\u2019t respond to me. But 2 hours later i get a text from her mom saying \u201cSo I\u2019ll see you at my house for \u2018friends\u2019 graduation party right?\u201d And i told her that i couldn\u2019t afford to go and apologized because i wish i could be there. Her mom then kept sending me texts trying to guilt me into going, even going as far as to saying she will pay for me to come and pay for the shift that I\u2019m missing. I told her I\u2019m not comfortable with it and she then said \u201c\u2018friend\u2019 would move mountains for you. Who would you move mountains for.\u201d But i literally have had 5 texting conversations since December, 4 of which i started. There would have been more but i decided in December that i wasn\u2019t going to put effort into our friendship if she wasn\u2019t putting effort in because i was tired of her never trying to contact me. The reason i came to that decision was because in the 6 months leading to December we had 15 texting conversations and i started 14 of those. Anyways. Her birthday was last week and i sent her a message saying \u201cHappy birthday!! Love and miss you!\u201d And she hasn\u2019t even opened it. I don\u2019t get why she\u2019s so mad at me for not being able to go to a party. If it was her actual graduation ceremony that i was invited to i would have done everything in my power to go, but it\u2019s just the party. \nAITA for not being able to go? I don\u2019t feel like i am. I feel like a actual friend would have been like \u201cI get that. It sucks but i get it. When is the next time you\u2019ll be up so i can see you?\u201d",

It happened shortly after I got engaged and I was preparing to ask her to be a bridesmaid in my wedding. There is not a day that has gone by since then that I haven't thought of her, at least a little, especially when memories of her constantly pop up. \n\nIt is hard. It is going to hurt, and it is going to hurt for a while. But every day the hurt gets to be a little less. Your friendship exists in time as a beautiful thing but sometimes it's better for everyone involved to just move forward. \n\nIt is ok to mourn this loss, it is ok to hurt, but it is so important to just keep moving forward.",

    "postText": "Thad a small get together at my apartment to celebrate my birthday. Most of my close friends couldn't make except for two (that I would to consider to be closest with) came by. One being a male and the other female.\nMy male friend would constantly ask me to hook him up with one of my female friends. I tried to two times and both times failed miserably. Ilet him know that I looked at her specifically as more than a friend but not a girlfriend.\n(If that makes any sense) But I had a good time and my birthday came and went. Shortly after during the get together and he asked her for her number. Even though i hinted that she is a free spirit and has multiple men at her beck and call. As well as knowing what her type is. But fast forward me and my make friend was hanging out and he brung her up again (this was about the 3rd time)and I was very avoidant of the answer being very vague. But clearly stating she wouldn't be interested. Then he said\n\"im implying he is un-attractive.\" Which never came from mouth. After that he showed me her number to confirm. I confirmed that was indeed her number. Then I said \"text her\" to call his bluff. But originally he did give her his cap to wear. So i didnt think it was that big of deal. But he ended up texting her and after a few text she just left him on read. I talked to her the next day, and she was like \"I was drunk and I give my number away without thinking.\" (Loosely translated) As well as stating yeah he never had a chance. As well as stating whenever I left, he would be more talkative. Which I talked to him about it he said that was absurd. I talked him later that night and he said that he was offended that I was implying that he was weird. As well as saying that I was in my feelings. We didn't leave off the call on great terms so I don't know if we are even friends at this point in time... (Also I had almost the same situation happen to me ears ago with one of my best friends that got the girl I was talking to snapchat on my birthday ) So, I kind of feel like its my past trauma with friends that propelled me to really feel uneasy about this second occurrence. \nAITA?",

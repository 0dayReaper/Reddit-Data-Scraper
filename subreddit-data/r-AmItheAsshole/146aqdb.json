    "postText": "My 10 year old nephew has been living in an assisted living school/hospital program for special needs children and I recently found out through my mom that he is ready for discharge. He is having a hard time finding a foster home because of his needs (he has severe PTSD and several mental and chronic physical illnesses) and can't return to his legal guardian. My mom called me to ask me out of the blue one day if my boyfriend and I (both early 20s) could foster him and I quickly shot it down. She tried to assure me that all of his healthcare, schooling and housing expenses would be paid for by the state but I still refused. We are not ready to take care of any child, let alone one with extreme trauma that we aren't qualified to help him with.  I find it unlikely the state actually covers as much as she claims to begin with, but even if they did we still only have one car and both work full time and we have animals which he couldn't be around for safety reasons.\n\nShortly after this news, I found out my best friend was in a horrible living situation and needed out quickly. After talking it over, my bf and I agreed he can move with us and be our roommate. He is expected to work and pick up after himself and be independent once he is on his feet, and we found a 2 bedroom apartment we can all afford together. We ended up picking him up much earlier than planned because there was the threat of him being homeless if we didn't come asap, so we've been paying for all his expenses (new shoes since his were destroyed, groceries, toiletries) ourselves. We've had him with us for about 2 weeks now and he starts working sometime within the next 10 days. \n\nI brought it up to my mom and she thinks I \"chose\" him over my nephew and that this is a terrible idea. She said I should have left my friend in the care of a homeless shelter and not taken him in myself. I understand my nephew is family but there's a massive difference between caring for a child for the next 8+ years and getting a roommate... Am I being selfish?",

Caring for a special needs child -and eventually adult- is a HUGE responsibility, and not even remotely on the same level as having an adult roommate who is able to be self-sufficient. The bigger question I have is why is your mother trying to guilt trip/push you into taking care of your nephew if it\u2019s as cheap and easy as she says? Why doesn\u2019t she just foster her grandson herself?",

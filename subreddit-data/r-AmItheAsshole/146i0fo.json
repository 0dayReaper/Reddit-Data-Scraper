I never say anything about it and i normally let her talk it out since that\u2019s how i know she likes to relieve stress and it helps her think things through to talk about it but it has come to the point where she will talk about him non-stop. Every conversation we have leads to him, and what he\u2019s done, and how he\u2019s annoying her, and i\u2019m starting to get tired of it. I\u2019ve tried telling her that I would like to talk about other things occasionally but she doesn\u2019t really respond well to me saying anything about it so i\u2019ve stopped.\n\nThis brings us to the fight we recently had. She was talking on and on and complaining about how he wasn\u2019t telling her things and how he was bothering her and that she was going to get her other friends to find out what she wanted to know since he didn\u2019t want to tell he directly and i finally said something and told her she is acting crazy.\n\nI\u2019ll admit i did not do it in the most gracious way. I said exactly \u201cAriel, you are acting fucking crazy right now and you don\u2019t even realize, if he didn\u2019t want to tell you then you should respect it.\u201d and with that she got up and stormed off. Since the she has being snippy and demanding i apologize but i don\u2019t think i need to. Yes, i apologized for being harsh with my wording and i admitted i could have been nicer but i stand by what i said and i think she needs to take a step back from this. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if what i did what wrong and if i should apologize. \nI am open to criticism since i often get told that i am \u201ccold\u201d and don\u2019t understand since i am not really interested in a relationship at all. So please tell me AITA?",

            "comment": "The only thing I find wrong here is your use of the term 'crazy', which you've already apologised for. You have nothing else to apologise for and I don't think you should retract your statement either. She's angry because you held a mirror up to her behaviour. She knows this behaviour is unhealthy.\n\nWhat I think you should do is establish boundaries. You are not her sounding board. This isn't friendship. The entire time you spend together revolves around talking about him. Tell her that you're not prepared to have these conversations anymore, and if she wants to spend time with you, she needs to stop. She is crossing your boundaries. She's also being entitled for 'demanding' a retraction of the truth.",

Getting her friends to force those out of him is definitely not the way to do that. I mean, is he in a relationship with all of them?\n\nNTA, she is definitely acting crazy, and needed a dose of reality check.\n\nEdit: added a few words",

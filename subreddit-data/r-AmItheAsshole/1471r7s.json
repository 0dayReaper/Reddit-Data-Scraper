She doesn't talk about how it's effecting her and she says that she gets fed up with it. \n\nMeaning that she holds onto it more than she expects. Lady is still a young person after all, and maybe haven't communicating boundaries but when you get sick of it. It's better to express that you're not okay with that instead of literally bottling up like she's been doing now.",

(We both are 19y/o)\nWe do name each other as a joke sometimes like (stupid/dumb). But this time I was fed up and shouted \u201cf*** off\u201d and then she called me \u201cuneducated\u201d, which is a word we never used for each other because we take it seriously. \nI locked myself in the room  (we live together),after 30 minutes she knocked on my door, she wanted to talk. But I told her that I\u2019m not letting her in. Then she texted me (I don\u2019t want to hear anything about you EVER) and unfollowed me, which she never done before and she only follows like 6 people. And I responded to the text with \u201cme too\u201d, because I was mad, I just wanted her to apologize to me once in her life, and I know that if I won\u2019t go talk to her and give in, the friendship is going to end. She\u2019s like that.\nSo\u2026 who is wrong ?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

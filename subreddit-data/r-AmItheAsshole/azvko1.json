She had to stay home 24/7 besides for school to take care of her little sisters. Its not like her parents weren\u2019t there they just didn\u2019t want the responsibility. Me being a hot headed 16 year old i showed up to the house and fought the step-father. Cops were called the truth came out on everything, they sided with me she was put into a special home for awhile until my parents were able to adopt her. Were not together anymore but we keep in touch and the 2 of us will never not love each other. We just ended up not working as boyfriend and girlfriend. \n\nEDIT - Thank you to who ever gave me my first silver!",

The only way out was for my parents to adopt her. I guess written down yea it sounds weird i was technically dating my adopted sister. But it was the right thing to do. Eventually we did break up and she was still living with me. Yes it was awkward but we still love each other as family we went through so much together. Shes been moved out for a couple years now but she still comes to visit here and there. Shes like family now. ",

My husband and I are the most stable (still poor, but we don't get in trouble or do drugs like the rest of my family, and we're the only ones our age who *want* kids) of the grandkids, and my mom just doesn't have the time, money, or energy to help. \n\nSomehow, even though we are persistent and kind, nothing is happening and this poor girl has to keep seeing her mom high or on death's doorstep. All we want is to get her into a loving home and get her the help she needs. My cousin might be a lost cause, but God it kills me to know how easily this little girl can get caught up in the same shit. \n\nNot saying you should do different. More of just commenting on how screwed up families can behave. Don't force caregiving on those who don't want to do so, and don't deprive children of love for your own stupid bullshit.",

State what you know to be true as true. No \"maybe\" no \"I think\" no \"I've heard\" simply \"this is exactly what happened. These children are in danger because XYZ. I am afraid for their life because XYZ\"\n\nI made the cps report on an old friend that finally got her kids taken away. Her family had been trying for months, but had not been so clear in their verbiage apparently and were hesitant to tarnish her name or come off as too \"extreme\" for the fear of getting in trouble or misleading. Not me. I didn't hold back a single detail, told them everything I had seen and everything I had heard. I had to fake my friendship with that abusive bitch and her psycho boyfriend because they were hotel hopping and prepping to leave the state to outrun CPS. They still don't know I'm the one who filed the report that got their children removed and placed with their grandmother. JUST in case they somehow manage to get custody back, her family and I made sure she thought it was them who filed the reports so that she'd still trust me and let me back in so I could keep an eye on the kids. Luckily it's looking like that will never happen because we're at 2 years later and they still haven't taken the necessary steps to get their lives on track.",

They both have a history of drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and domestic violence. When we were younger she just seemed very easily influenced and manipulated, and kind of dumb. I don't say that to be mean either, there was just always something missing in her when it came to common sense.\n\nAs we've gotten older, I've lost my sympathy for her. You HAVE to grow up if you have children, and the abuse she subjected them to is disgusting. She still defends her ex boyfriend and the situation. She says the older kid \"liked it\" because she would antagonize her parents into fighting. The boyfriend would punish the kids by beating up their mother in front of them and screaming \"this is what you're making me do, are you happy?\" Which I didn't know until after they were taken away.\n\nI truly think there's something wrong with her, something that makes her lack a lock of really basic human understanding. She's diagnosed bipolar, but I know plenty of people on that spectrum, and it's not the same. Like she just can't get through her head that some things are bad or inherently wrong.",

If the parents were told she needs a caretaker, then she NEEDS a caretaker. Maybe she would be able to make some improvements if she was working with a professional. I get that she's low functioning, but it's possible that she can sense the animosity OP was beginning to feel toward her (which is not his fault). Which could cause her to lash out more?\n\nIdk I have a severely autistic cousin (he is verbal and doesn't need 24/7 supervision though) and he has a loving family who is always there for him. I wonder how lost he would be without that support system. OP's parents obviously don't care about their autistic daughter, if they did they wouldn't push her off on a teenage brother who obviously isn't capable of handling that responsibility, or use her to scam their family.\n\nI just hope she will be OK. What are the parents going to do with her now that their free babysitter and money are gone? Are they going to pay for a professional caretaker themselves, or just neglect her? OP if you see this, this is NOT a guilt trip, but someone in your family should keep tabs on what's going on with your sister. It sounds like she may be better off in an institution then with parents who obviously can't or aren't willing to give her the care she needs.",

Unlike OP's parents they truly loved and cared about their son and because of that they resisted putting him into a care facility. They didn't want to abandon him. They didn't want to feel like they were bad parents.\n\nTheir son hit and bit and broke everything. For his own safety, and theirs, they had to remove everything except a mattress from his room. For thirteen years, his mother did not have a night of unbroken sleep.\n\nIn the interview, the father described his feelings when they left their son at the facility. That his son probably couldn't understand how hurt they were, how much he hurt them, and how sorry they were. He only knew that the only people in the world that he ever truly knew were leaving him, alone, in a strange place. \n\nHe also describes the first home visit after that. How their son walked into a house that had changed so much while he was gone, but he didn't melt down. He was calm and happy. The care facility gives him appropriate activities throughout the day so he's never bored. They take care of him. As his father drove him back to the facility, he played a kind of game, where he says,\"The letter D!\" And his father responds, \"And D is for...\"\n\n\"Dumptruck.\" And then he said, \"And D is for Daddy.\"\n\n[\"Unconditional Love\", This American Life](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/381444650/this-american-life)",

They were very disengaged and ineffective. I was a counseling intern once upon a time, but, b/c of my college experience, I made sure I was ready. I read and studied constantly. I watched videos of effective sessions. I kept a pad with questions and responses with me in case I blanked. If I needed help from my supervisor, I got her involved. I talked to the experienced counselors on staff regularly. My point is, you have to be careful with counselors at colleges. You never know what you will have to work with. The same can be said to some extent for licensed counselors. There are good and bad ones. But, at least you can use the internet and connections to find one that is good. The last two I went to were awesome (one was marriage and one was individual.)",

You can even go to the supervisor directly. The intern has to tell you that they report their cases to the supervisor anyway. That being said, there are a lot of fantastic counseling students who work their butts off to do everything they can, so deff don\u2019t write off college counseling. It is free to you because you already pay for it through tuition so you might as well check it out. And guaranteed confidentiality when you are 18. The laws can get a bit murky on confidentiality when you are underage. \n\nI would also look into getting paperwork from your parents so you have it on hand and don\u2019t have to ask them for it down the road, such as your birth certificate and social security card.

I had to live it all out, was asked things forward and backwards, seemingly in an attempt to find any iota of bullshit in my story. In the end I had to get letters from my aunt who explained that I had a strained relationship with my mother and that there was no way I'd be able to complete the FAFSA and get aid unless they were able to waive dependency. \n\nEventually I did get independent status but it was a LONG and painful process, one I wouldn't wish upon anyone.

Keep in mind caretakers are *expensive*. And they're wishing this irresponsible form of care on their other kid. As someone who sees parents manage without help, it's exasperating to see that they have the money and aren't using it to help her. It's cruel.",

I myself have a disabled sister, and while she isn't that bad, only mentally slow (still able to do most things, just sucks with money and social queues) I had to take a 2 week class to even be considered for being a caregiver and they made my parents take  4 week class. Your sister will flourish with the right care of someone who has been trained to deal with this. I can't tell you how much I hope that she gets what she needs, as I would help my sister out with everything I had if I needed to. \n\nAlong with that, if you have been doing so much (like it sounds like you have), the caretaker would be able to see that and you would get to genuinely see your sister in better hands (no offense to your parents, I just know how hard being a caretaker can be). Whatever happens, please get your sister some sort of help, whether its getting her to a caretaker or forcing your family to get training, or whatever it is you think will help her best. Please OP, I know it would hurt your parents, but consider your sister over them. She needs help.",

You're entitled to a free report every year through a number of reputable sites (not sure if I'm allowed to link them). You should also keep monitoring your credit going forward- your parents have shown that they are willing to take advantage of you and your family, and that may mean using your info for loans and credit cards.\n\nYou may want to look into being declared independent for the FAFSA. It's really difficult to do, but very worthwhile if you can swing it. Out of state tuition can be a pain to afford, although I don't think anyone would argue with your desire to put some distance between yourself and your parents. I wish you the very best of luck.",

                    "comment": "I am so sorry that you and OP have had to go through everything you have. As someone with a severely disabled sibling, I want to illustrate how this is supposed to work.\n\nMy sibling is mentally and physically handicapped (think an infant stuck in an adult body.) My family is very lucky that he qualifies for a lot of assistance from the government to take care of him (due to the nature of his disability.) That money is supposed to go to care takers, equipment, and other essentials directed towards **his care.** There are lists of things that money can and can't get used for. When he was an adult, his rights to dictate his life were waived (because he doesn't understand virtually anything that happens around him.) And an official observed his living conditions to make sure he was being cared for, and that his rights getting waived wasn't a form of financial abuse (OPs parents sound like they were definitely using the sister for financial abuse IMHO.)\n\nMy sibling is older than me. He requires skilled nursing care. As a child I was never expected to care for him. While I was taught basic things like tube feeding, how to treat/recognize seizures ect, I only learned those things in case I was left alone with him and couldn't find an adult to help.\n\nAs an adult, I was encouraged to learn how to take care of him. It would've been a great skill to put on a resume, it would've lifted some financial burden off of the family, and it would've given my parents peace of mind that my sibling would've been cared for if my sibling outlived them. It became clear that I did not have the constitution, confidence, or general suitability needed to care for my sibling properly.\n\nWhile I am sure it disappointed my parents that neither me nor my other siblings would be able to become caretakers, they accepted this, and sought other strategies to give my sibling care in the case that he outlived them.\n\nAs I understand it, me and the other siblings will be in charge or guaranteeing my sibling's well being. But we will  be hiring other people to take care of him, while we essentially quality check his care, and advocate for him when he needs it.\n\nIt is absolutely wrong that your parents or OPs parents force the care of a sibling on you. There are people trained to take care of our siblings. We do not suddenly get that responsibility thrust on us because we happen to be related. OPs parents using him as a free care giver is both neglectful to the sister (robbing her of trained care) and neglectful of OP (for obvious reasons.) Your parents expecting you to care for your sibling despite danger to yourself is also neglectful to you. You have your own needs, and there are other people better equipped to take care of your sibling than you.\n\nDon't let anybody tear down your life because of a sibling. You have just as many needs as your sibling, his needs are simply more difficult to meet. But it is up to the parent to make sure the needs of both kids are met. ",

They believed it was your sole purpose to care for your sister, not to have a life of your own.\n\nThey treated you like a free caretaker, not as an independent person worthy of your own life, your own dreams, your own goals. THEY chose your goals for you, and without - or in direct contrast to your input.\n\nBut from their perspective... THEY didn't ask for this burden either. They assumed they were going to be getting another normal healthy child, and instead were given a person who needs constant and direct care. THEY don't get to live their lives anymore either. And they've been swept up in that for a very long time. They feel like they've been given this burden, and that you're all in it together as a family.\n\nYour mind can do very strange things when its under constant extreme stress. As they see it, they made the best decisions with the information available. They made one consolation, chipping away at your individualism, and that seemed reasonable.... then struck another chip away... then another... then another. Each individual step seeming perfectly reasonable. But they can't look at it as a whole.\n\nThat's where strangers or people who are not experiencing that daily trauma have to come in and lend perspective. Somebody has to step outside of that loop and lend a reasonable ear. Somebody has to right some wrongs that have been too long in coming.\n\n-------\n\nI'm glad you've found somewhere you can breathe and spend these last years to be a young adult and grow up in a less toxic environment.\n\nI'm hopeful that if your parents are given enough time, and actually get your sister enough professional help that they themselves can take that step back and see the errors of their ways. But if they can't that's their problem, not yours.\n\nJust keep breathing, just keep living. Make some goals and work toward them. But most importantly - Go have some fun. You deserve it.",

A few months ago, I was still pregnant with my now one month old daughter, and the ultrasound showed that I had some pretty serious things going on. One of the scariest for me, personally, was that there were several things that indicated my daughter might have a chromosome disorder like downs syndrome or trisomy 18. They did testing, which took about 2 weeks to come back. In that 2 weeks, I really struggled with things. I was angry and scared. The thing that made me most upset was thinking about how if the baby did have this major disorder, it would affect my 5 year old sons life in such a negative way. I felt like it was so unfair to put such a burden on him. All of our extra time, attention, and resources would have to go towards caring for her and that just broke my heart. I know it might sound pretty shitty that I thought that way, but those were my honest feelings. The kids who are already here, matter. Thank God all of the testing came back normal and she's doing great now, but those were the longest 2 weeks of my life. Your parents failed you in such a major way and I am so glad you have a grandfather to actually look out for you and care about you. Your parents suck. ",

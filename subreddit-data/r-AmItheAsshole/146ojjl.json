Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (24 female) and my best friend (28 female) have been friends for a little over 7 years. We met when we worked at the same place together and just really connected. She moved back to her home state multiple times throughout our friendship. She says we\u2019re family but left on multiple occasions during traumatic things in my life. For example, in 2021 both of my parents passed away and I was put in the hospital. For those of you wondering, the house filled with carbon monoxide due to my dad leaving the truck running while in it. She went to the funeral and made a huge scene but i ignored it as she was just upset cause \u201cthey were her parents too\u201d then blocked me, and moved away the same week. She isn\u2019t a bad person just has done some bad things in our friendship. Well the reason I\u2019m posting this is because a couple months ago she did the same thing, my grandma passed away and I wasn\u2019t replying back to her a-lot cause I was mourning. I don\u2019t reply to a-lot of people when I mourn it\u2019s just how I do it. She got upset and when I started getting back to normal she was being super weird. I asked her if she was still planning on moving back before June like we had talked about or if I needed to keep saving money like I had been to make the trip to see her. When I asked she completely blew up and started saying things like \u201cI don\u2019t want her to come home\u201d \u201cI was never her friend\u201d \u201cI only care about myself\u201d. I don\u2019t know what I did to cause the blow up, I just wanted to see her. I missed her a lot, and I never thought she would turn on me like this and didn\u2019t really know how to react, I tried to explain to her but she only wanted to keep going on, talking about her music and how I never supported her(she creates music), discovering who she is, saying I don\u2019t care about trans rights and the struggle they go through (she has recently come out as trans), and just talking about herself and how I don\u2019t care about her. I don\u2019t understand what I did wrong, I never thought I was a bad friend to her. I did so much to try to prove to her that I love her like a sister. She\u2019s used everything that i have ever agreed with her on against me. She made it seem like her parents were such awful people then turned that against me in this fight, same with her childhood best friend. I hate fighting with her cause I miss her so much, I\u2019ve tried reaching out to her to talk about things but she has me blocked and I think our friendship is over.

            "comment": "1) I'm going to assume MTF otherwise YTA.\n\nI am not trans, but I am heavily in favor of people living their lives however they want to as long as it doesn't negatively impact others. I try to be a good ally. So while I don't speak of personal experience I have heard of these things from people who have gone through it. \n\nBasically from what I've heard is that when you start taking the hormone replacement therapy is that it is very similar to a second puberty. So I don't want to dismiss her struggles, or yours, I think this may have a heavy impact on the events you're talking about. Looking back at my own puberty, I was very inconsistent with my thoughts and actions, sometimes I was just mad for no reason, twitchy might be a good term? \n\nAll that being said, your personal state never gives you the right to be cruel, which she has been for sure. So it's either NTA or ESH (I think is the term?). I'm just hoping I can shed some light on a possible reason why and I'm hoping you both can work past this. Although I wouldn't blame you if you didn't want to continue this friendship it sounds exhausting.",

And the quick skim about her coming out as trans? So many questions.\n\nRegardless of them, you stated you have a history of going low contact during times of grief, and I'm guessing stress as well. If your friend was also grieving or stressed, your silence could be seen as a rejection. I can give no judgment as there are too many questions. \n\nHowever. I'm betting your question about if she was moving back or if you needed to save up to see her came off as snotty and annoyed. Think about how you spoke. Just a hunch.",

She is using time agreeing with her about how her parents have treated her over the years, same for the child hood friend, she would make them all seem like they treated her like dirt and weren\u2019t good people to her. Her coming out as trans has never been an issue for me, I was and still am fully supportive of her coming out. She was not grieving at this time, she was sending me videos of her music and other things. If you have no opinion that\u2019s perfectly fine. I hope this helped tho",

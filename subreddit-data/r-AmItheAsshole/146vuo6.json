My husband's sister was first upset that I was due in the same month that both of her daughters were born in (10+ years earlier) because \"but that's OUR birthday month!\"  And then she doubled down on her entitled anger when I had a girl (we didn't find out before the birth) because until that point, her daughters were her parents' only granddaughters (many grandsons had been born in between).  Then on special occasions, she loudly insisted that the grandparents had to see her kids first, open their gifts first, etc., because her daughters \"came first\".  Can't make this stuff up.   Luckily, grandparents thought this was ridiculous, and the cousins grew up to be close anyway.  \nShe thought it was like when a new cute kid was introduced on a sitcom because the original cute kids were getting older and losing the cuteness factor.   Um, yeah, our plans to start a family were all about YOU and replacing your kids for the grandparents. /s  \nI couldn't decide if she was that threatened or just self-centered.  Sheesh.  Now I just ignore that noise.",

Until that point, I didn\u2019t care what I was having but I was a little disappointed to discover I was having boy #7.  Stepsister got pregnant on purpose later that year (baby trapped her boyfriend) and had the only girl out of 10.  \ud83d\ude44\n\nAlso, in regards to the baby having the same first letter\u2026I have two cousins who share mine and my sister\u2019s first and middle names down to the spelling because their mom just LOVED our names.  They\u2019re 10 years younger than us.  If there\u2019d been a 3rd, she\u2019d have used my youngest sister\u2019s name.  Mom thinks it\u2019s weird as all get out but it\u2019s whatever.",

She'd already cowed her own siblings and cousins, but her sister-in-law wasn't very cooperative, hence the need for her husband to reign in his big sister....",

I think it was seen as a non event when my father and his brother married women with the same name as one of his sisters. I have a memory of a Christmas where the three were sitting next to each other on the couch and another cousin came out to say there was a phone call for Aunty X, at that point they all looked at him and asked which Aunty X? He had to go back to phone to find out. \ud83e\udd23\n\nBtw we also have multiple people born on  the same day - it\u2019s seen as an honour with people often trying to predict birthdays of new babies to hit on their own birthday. Unfortunately my niece had her first baby a couple weeks after my birthday this year - but my own daughter is on the same day as my mum and my son is a couple of days later than one of his cousins (he was disappointed too). \n\nWhat I\u2019m getting to here is that joy should be shared. Other peoples happiness (particularly if it\u2019s family or close friends) does not equate to unhappiness for you. So you can have the attitude that it\u2019s all unfair and how dare they\u2026 or you can celebrate and know that they will share a bond. \n\nIt\u2019s actually not a competition\u2026 really it isn\u2019t.",

I was the baby... the oops ( sis, 12 yrs older, brother 11 yrs, and sis 10 yrs older) My sisters and brother all had their kids within 3 yrs of each other, when I was 10 to 13. They were all content raising their kids until I got married at 22 and pregnant a year later. My Sister in law freaked because before this, my nephew, her youngest, was the baby of the family. My first son had several issues at birth and unfortunately became the light of my late father's life. He had alcohol issues and completely reformed after my son was born, even more so when my second son was born 18 months later. My sister in law made my brother get a reverse on his vasectomy so they could have my nephew... once again, the baby of the family.",

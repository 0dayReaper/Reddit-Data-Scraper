    "postText": "I (f27) have been with my husband (m33) for 5 years and married for 2.\n\nBefore we got together, he was in a flirting situation with one of his co-worker, that I\u2019ll call M. It ended once we officially started dating. \n\nSince then, there\u2019s been a few issues with her. Some examples: She used to constantly call my husband at random times during the night, she\u2019d shows up to our house during his days off just to see him and she also insulted multiple times behind my back. \nIt stopped for a while but started again after we got married. \n\nMy husband tried to put an end to it, i tried too but nothing worked. At some point, she got tired of it I guess and stopped on her own. \n\nOnto the issue: My husband has a work event coming soon and he asked me to come. Thing is, I already know how it\u2019s gonna go for me: His co-workers are either gonna be rude or ignore me because they\u2019re on M\u2019s side,M is gonna throw shade at me the whole night and I\u2019ll eventually end up with nobody to talk to and be alone for the rest of the night.\n\nSo I\u2019ve told my husband I didn\u2019t want to go because I wouldn\u2019t enjoy it. He asked why and I told him that None of his co-workers would want me there and I\u2019ll end up alone the whole night\n\nHe said I wouldn\u2019t be and promised to stay by my side the whole time. I apologized and said I wouldn\u2019t change my mind because I know he won\u2019t hold up to his promises. And I don\u2019t blame him for that, there\u2019s gonna be a lot of his friends so it\u2019s normal he won\u2019t want to stick by my side the whole night.\n\nMy husband dropped the conversation and have been very cold since.\n\nMy mom says my reason to not go is childish and stupid and I should just accept to go because it\u2019s important for husband. \n\nAITA for refusing to go to his work-related event just bc of his co-workers?\n\nInfo: Because a few made me realize I didn\u2019t make it clear enough: This situation already happened before, hence the \"I know how this is gonna go\" and \"I know he won\u2019t hold up to his promises\"",

If his colleagues are on her side, there may be history here you're not familiar with. \n\nFrom here, it looks like he's gaslighting you. He's dismissing your very valid concerns and treating you as if you're the problem. There's more to this. Please be sure you're not turning a blind eye. You don't have to be dim-witted to be gaslit.

Maybe he gets off on the attention or is at least flattered by it, doesn't want to rock the boat at work or he's had an affair with the woman and can't afford to piss her off lest she tell his wife. Something strange is going on with the husband that he prioritizing some annoying woman he works over his wife. The woman is actively mentally abusing the wife and the husband just shrugs and claims 'he's tried his best'. No, he clearly hasn't because he hasn't escalated to his HR department.\n\nAlso, this woman clearly isn't an actual stalker or the police would be involved.",

It ended once we officially started dating. \n\nSince then, there\u2019s been a few issues with her. Some examples: She used to constantly call my husband at random times during the night, she\u2019d shows up to our house during his days off just to see him and she also insulted multiple times behind my back. \nIt stopped for a while but started again after we got married. \n\nMy husband tried to put an end to it, i tried too but nothing worked. At some point, she got tired of it I guess and stopped on her own. \n\nOnto the issue: My husband has a work event coming soon and he asked me to come. Thing is, I already know how it\u2019s gonna go for me: His co-workers are either gonna be rude or ignore me because they\u2019re on M\u2019s side,M is gonna throw shade at me the whole night and I\u2019ll eventually end up with nobody to talk to and be alone for the rest of the night.\n\nSo I\u2019ve told my husband I didn\u2019t want to go because I wouldn\u2019t enjoy it. He asked why and I told him that None of his co-workers would want me there and I\u2019ll end up alone the whole night\n\nHe said I wouldn\u2019t be and promised to stay by my side the whole time. I apologized and said I wouldn\u2019t change my mind because I know he won\u2019t hold up to his promises. And I don\u2019t blame him for that, there\u2019s gonna be a lot of his friends so it\u2019s normal he won\u2019t want to stick by my side the whole night.\n\nMy husband dropped the conversation and have been very cold since.\n\nMy mom says my reason to not go is childish and stupid and I should just accept to go because it\u2019s important for husband. \n\nAITA for refusing to go to his work-related event just bc of his co-workers?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

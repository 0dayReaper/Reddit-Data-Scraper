    "postText": "I (24m) am visiting my Mom (54) for a couple of days. Yesterday evening I was in the kitchen preparing a chicken dish.\n\nMy mom's Boyfriend (55) came into the kitchen to prepare a salad and asked me if he could use the cutting board. The cutting board and knife were still soaked with chicken juice and had tiny bits of raw chicken on it, so I obviously said no, that he should use the spare one. I was still busy with cooking, but had planned to clean both by hand and then put it in the dishwasher. \n\nI am very cautious about food safety (especially regarding chicken) and I would not have let him used the board, even if he cleaned it by hand. Since I don't trust meat contaminated tools, if they weren't in the dishwasher.\n\nMy mom's Boyfriend on the other hand does not believe in food poisoning. He never had it, so obviously it can't exist. I don't know why he is so unreasonable regarding this topic, since he is not like that with other stuff. He is not anti-Vax or anything, it's just food safety he doesn't believe in.  \n\nHe still insisted on using the cutting board and knife. I reminded him of salmonella, to which he just sighed :\" You and your salmonella...\". I replied that if he wants to use it then fine, if he cleans it, it may not be up to my cleaning standards, but I don't have to eat that salad. Well that man did not intend to clean the cutting board, he wanted to cut the vegetables, that he wanted to eat raw, on the dirty cutting board, with the dirty knife. I immediately told him, that he cannot do that and we had a heated discussion. \n\nThis was not the first time we had a fight about food safety and I have more than once refused to eat anything he had prepared. In the past I had grabbed the kitchen utensils out of his hand and ensured that he could not do stupid like that. But this time I was already exhausted from having such a stupid discussion. I was also caught off guard, because he never attempted something so unsafe before. So I thought fine, if he wants to give himself salmonella so badly, then I will not stop him. \nI just warned my Mom how he prepared said salad (she did not eat it) and let him eat his food hazard. \n\nYou can probably guess what happened next.  \nIt's the next day and as expected, he is laying sick in bed. \n\nMy Mom pulled me aside and told me, I should have stopped him from preparing the salad on the cutting board. That I knew what would happen and that it was cruel of me, to let him eat it. \nI responded, that she knew how he prepared it and could have stopped him from eating it. Her reasoning is that there was already an argument, because she refused to eat the salad herself and she did not want to cause another. \n\nI do feel bad that he is know sick, but I tried to talk him out of it and I don't think i should have to physically stop him from doing something stupid like that. On the other hand I do feel like an asshole for letting him go trough with it.\n\nSo am I the asshole?",

Some of them would buy a hot chook and continue to eat it over 8 or 9 days. Our office was without power for 5 days but some of them still ate the food in the fridge/freezer. They all had kids and just blamed their kids/gastro if they ever got sick. As soon as I left that job, my phobias disappeared.",

Some rules are definitely must follow (raw chicken cutting board salad) and some are more flexible (some food expiry dates).  \n\n\nThe story about OP's mom making stew:   \n\n\nThe situation depends. Mom's right in the sense of cooking it and letting it sit the the it taste better because residual heat makes it like a slow cook environment, more time to bring the flavors out. The depends part on this is are they in a tropical climate or a winter climate. When something's cooked thoroughly, it's essentially sterile. So if the ambient temperature it's not hot, whatever bacteria growth is non-existent to slow where it won't impact food safety significantly.  \n\n\nHowever, if they are in a warmer climate, didn't follow food handling techniques to a T, then yeah, it can be a problem for the food to be out for so long. In this scenario, OP is definitely right.  \n\n\nMy grandparents used to live without refrigerators back in the day. By thoroughly boiling/reheating the food  every couple hours (while in a hot/tropical climate; but not in sunlight) if it's being left out allows for sterilization of bacteria to keep the food food safe. \n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nMy degree's in Immunology and used to work in clinical labs. So I know exact biohazard protocols that need to be followed and what the science is behind it all.",

It\u2019s why stuff like bleach-washed chicken is a thing in the US, and was a sticking point in what few post-brexit trade negotiations we\u2019ve managed to have with the US.",

Typically, people who don't worry about food poisoning and eat questionable things grew up doing that, meaning their bodies are quite used to it, and so those people actually don't get sick from ingesting bacteria that would make others sick, because their bodies are used to it.  Kind of like how you don't drink the water in a foreign country because it'll make you sick, but the locals can drink it without issue.  \n\nAlso, there wouldn't really be a way to know for sure he had food poisoning, unless he had a stool sample tested or something.  Doctors do diagnose food poisoning based on symptoms alone, because there are some differences between a stomach bug and food poisoning.  For example, food poisoning usually happens rather quickly--within six hours of ingesting the tainted food--whereas a stomach bug will come on more gradually.  Seeing how this guy didn't get sick until the next day makes me wonder, if it is a true story, if he just had a stomach flu.",

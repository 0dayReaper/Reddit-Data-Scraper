    "postText": "So my friend 20f and I 19m have been friends for a few years and she recently got engaged.\n\nA week ago I got a dm from her for a small costume party she was hosting as a celebration for her getting engaged. I asked if there was a theme and she said there wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m a cosplayer so I had a lot of choices.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to rock up in an anime cosplay, so I thought it would be funny to go to an engagement party as the Corpse Bride. I arrived at her house yesterday and everything seemed normal. A few people complemented my costume and I was having a lot of fun.\n\nAfter ten minutes my friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9 walked out in a black tuxedo and announced this was actually their wedding. Apparently my friend saw a video of someone doing this and wanted to do the same.\n\nHe asked us all to go to the back yard for the ceremony to begin. I went straight to him. I asked him if I should quickly go home and change my outfit and that I would get back before it started. He told me it was fine since I didn\u2019t know this was the wedding.\n\nI trusted him and followed everyone outside. They got married and everything seemed good. The reception was just in their house again so everyone just walked back inside and picked up where they left off. I tried talking to my friend and celebrating with her but she kept making excuses to not talk to me.\n\nI assumed it was just because she was tried from the big day and wanted some alone time. I didn\u2019t bother her after that and the party soon ended.\n\nI got home and half an hour passed when my phone started getting notifications. I checked and it was my friend texting me. She was cussing me out and telling me how I ruined her wedding. I was really confused and asked what I did.\n\nThat only made her more angry. She told me it was basic knowledge not to wear a wedding dress to a wedding. I reminded her I had no idea it was a wedding and that I asked her now husband if I should change and he said it was fine.\n\nShe didn\u2019t respond, but I got a text from her husband. He asked why I would tell her he said it was fine. I told him he said it was fine. Then he said how I should have changed anyways and it\u2019s my fault that the two are now fighting over this.\n\nI\u2019ve tried texting her that I wad sorry and if I had known I wouldn\u2019t have done it. I woke up today and saw her and her husband have blocked me on everything.\n\nSo, AITA for not changing out of the wedding dress when I found out it was actually a wedding?\n\nEdit: I am a guy. I cosplayed the character Emily from The Corpse Bride and had blue paint all over. I\u2019m also Australian and I\u2019ve never heard a costume party meaning fancy. Everyone was dressed up in funny costumes\n\nUpdate: https://www.reddit.com/user/DanWantsDeath/comments/11l42nb/update_aita_for_wearing_a_wedding_dress_to_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",

When asked about a theme you were not given any restrictions.\n3.  *They* sprung a surprise wedding on *you*.\n4. Once you realized this you asked the groom if you should go home and change *and the groom said no*.\n\nThey had multiple chances to get you to change and they didn't take any of them so getting mad with you after the fact doesn't make any sense.\n\n*Edited format.

You then did the decent thing to ask whether you should change and they didn't think it was necessary.\n\nI think the fact that they have blocked you is probably a good thing because you don't need that in your life.",

OP is a MAN who dressed up as corpse bride. He is also 19 which I think is old enough not to know the rules around weddings. I am 20 and have never heard don't wear white at wedding related events. It's always just at the wedding.\n\n It seems very clear that it was meant as a gag, and not some sly way to take attention off the bride. \n\nHowever regardless of whether or not that's okay, upon hearing that it was their wedding, he IMMEDIATELY asked if he should go home and change. This places him firmly in NTA. I don't see why people think he's self-absorbed. Self-absorbed people don't inconvenience themselves to accommodate a lame surprise wedding. I've never even heard of that. Seems like a terrible idea. \n\nI'd argue that the only asshole here is the groom and soft TA to the bride. The groom should have asked the bride if she wanted you to change before saying you could stay. (Though immediately cussing someone out is over the line. You'd think a few years of friendship would warrant some benefit of the doubt.) \n\nWith the ages given, and how they handled this conflict, I don't think you have to worry about them as a couple for very long though.

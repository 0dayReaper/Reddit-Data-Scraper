If you don't trust him because he cheats- your better option would be to end it anyway and find someone who isn't like this because you can't dictate who people can and can't see. You're so so young. Many guys out there. Also if someone wants to cheat- they will find a way. Not letting them do things won't stop that. It's something you gotta let go of and try build yourself up a bit. If you think someone might cheat just tell yourself you're awesome and gorgeous and they'd be an idiot to cheat on you. Be strong. Good luck.",

It kills to have your feelings for someone not reciprocated but I\u2019m so sorry to say, this happens a lot over your dating years. I\u2019ve always told my daughters: the person you\u2019re dating is either going to be the one you spend the rest of your life with or just a loved one for a little while. If you can\u2019t see yourself with that person forever, they aren\u2019t \u201cthe one\u201d. Lucky for you, you have your whole life ahead of you! You\u2019re just getting started.

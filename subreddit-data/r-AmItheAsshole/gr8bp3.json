When she realized she wouldn\u2019t get any of his estate, she sold whatever she could, the most expensive being his motorcycles. She told the buyers her husband had died and she didn\u2019t have any paperwork. I think they planned on flipping them right away because my aunt found them for sale online. There was already a detective involved because the ex gf did all sorts of illegal stuff right after my uncle\u2019s death. They were able to recover the motorcycles and told the buyers if they wanted their money back, they could take it up with the woman who sold them. \n\nThe buyers were trying to explain their way out of it but they must\u2019ve known that their money was long gone. They would not have given the Harleys back without law enforcement.\n\nEdit: a word.",

That\u2019s like your girlfriend selling a dog out from under you while you are on a business trip because she didn\u2019t like it! \n\nThe audacity. If she didn\u2019t like it, she could\u2019ve just ignored it. The most toxic part is that she sees no issue. Your property, your house, she throws it away? And if any judge knows the worth of that car they would understand suing her for the costs. LET ALONE THE TIME YOU SPENT ON IT.\n\n\nThat\u2019s a hobby, and a damn good one. If she couldn\u2019t support you and your project, that probably would\u2019ve been a red flag for anything you do later on. I think this is all justified.\n\n\nEdit:to add NTA",

Point blank, it did not belong to her so she had ZERO right to do anything to it, period.\n\nI've got over 10K comic books, but I haven't actively collected in years at this point. If a SO decided they didn't like how much space it takes up and told me they wanted the comics gone my answer would be \"nope\"... and I can tell you right now, if I came home to find them gone there's a good chance I'd end up on the wrong side of prison bars for a while.\n\nJust because you weren't ***actively*** working on it in that specific second of time... that does not mean it's somehow acceptable for her to ignore that you had already told her no and decide to trash your belongings. Others have said you definitely should sue, which I completely agree with, but I also agree with whomever it was that said to include the hours you put in to finding parts and working on it -- that has value too.\n\nEdited to add: Someone else suggested calling the company that took the car: I agree! Have your attorney get in touch with them ASAP, chances are high that they have everything still. And if they hesitate to return any of it, your attorney can point out that technically they assisted in committing grand theft because they clearly didn't verify ownership of the vehicle before removing it, which makes the company and each person who was there that day complicit in a felony...",

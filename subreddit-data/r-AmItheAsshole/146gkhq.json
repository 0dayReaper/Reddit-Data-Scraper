If he wants to go, he can just find his own way too.",

About the gym: if it\u2019s your therapy, you don\u2019t have to self sabotage so she\u2019ll shut up calling you a snot and a brat. You are protecting yourself, and I for one applaud you. \n\nAbout your mom: you need an adult you can trust and who will listen to you seriously and respectfully. Have you a therapist? A teacher? I myself don\u2019t trust clergy to be hardheaded but that\u2019s me. Could planned parenthood advise you? \n\nHang in there. Because your mother is trying to weaponize sharing to bring you into line and break your spirit doesn\u2019t mean you have to cave. After all, you\u2019ve made it this far. Respect and best wishes.",

It's not fair that OP is having to do all this extra work, as his wife wants to have her cake and eat it too, but OP should also stand up for himself!\n\n(Also, my ESH vote is coming from someone who had both parents miss their 10th birthday because they were going abroad!

I used to pay for my kids horse back riding lessons for a few years and it was expensive and thankfully she didn\u2019t want to compete but she did it all the way to jumping. It\u2019s like owning a sailboat. It\u2019s a money dump and you have to have it to put in to do the hobby.  The couple need to go over their finances and reevaluate because he\u2019s going to get sick from overworking and the wife is unrealistic.",

If its costing you $38k a year, its an expensive hobby.\n\nIt sounds to me like you are living well above your means and have plenty of areas you could cut out (I'm sure the golf membership costs a pretty penny also). The budget for my son's 8th birthday party WAS $550, and yet your wife has spent this just on a deposit for a photographer. \n\nYou and your wife need a serious sit down and financial intervention.",

I've been in a financially abusive relationship and (while the numbers were smaller) OP's situation sounds so similar.  My ex would pull shit like refusing to eat anything from home and only wanting take out, ask me to pay for it, the berate me about my spending.  \n\nWhen I proposed the idea of me quitting my job so I could go back to school full time and get a better paying job, she shot the idea down before I could finish my sentence.  I managed to find a better paying job less than a year later, and within three months she came to me with the exact same idea, she'd quit her job and go back to school full time, then when she was done I could quit mine and go back.  At this point in our relationship she making over twice as much as I was, and somehow we had the money to cover everything on my paycheck alone, but not with hers.  \n\nThat's when things got really bad.  She would over spend on her credit card every month, book vacations without talking to me first, keep all the nights and TV when she'd leave to house, leave the water running, still only want to eat take out, and constantly ask me to buy her pointless stuff and throw a fit if I said no.  Much like OP I would work five or six days a week twelve hours a day just to keep up on everything.  \n\nIt wasn't until after that relationship ended that I realized that what she was doing was intentional so I couldn't save any money and it would be harder for me to leave.",

I grew up in Ireland where horses are less class oriented than most countries (not always but generally.)\n\nI spent the day like all my Saturdays between 6 and 14 years old. Got the bus or a lift to the stables, worked as unpaid labour cleaning stalls, grooming the horses, cleaning tack etc in return for lessons. Originally basic horse riding but then skilled aspects such as dressage, riding different jockey styles and learning how to teach. You could pick up grooms work for people who showed horses and earn cash or even stuff like braiding manes and tails if like me you really enjoyed the horse care more than the horse riding (I was shit at it!)\n\nLots of the other kids there used those equestrian skills to join the Army and get the better ceremonial postings allowing them to emigrate. Others me included paid for our education or extra curriculars that got us jobs or university places and get out of a shitty economy. We did not relate to the people who owned horses as a money to burn hobby job unless we were what they burned it on.\n\nI remember at the end of the day as it was my birthday the famously grumpy owner produced a cake for us all, let us ride the horses bareback on the gallops which normally was forbidden and then the adults had a beer or two and we all played silly games like jumping the haybales. It was huge fun, totally unexpected and not a photo in sight. Tbf I\u2019d definitely done more than 650\u00a3 work in that time but point stands, horses might expensive but doesn\u2019t mean you have to have every other facet of life eat money too!\n\nI quit horseriding at 14 when I discovered boys and fashion but I learned early if you have one potentially spendy interest, budget to enjoy it to full advantage. Especially since I was raised by a mother who always put animals above her kids\u2026",

In the short-term, picking up that extra shift is the right thing to do, but it\u2019s not sustainable for you to keep working full time AND part time to try to make up for what she\u2019s costing you.   \nEven worse, by doing this while your daughter is young, what she\u2019s going to remember are the times her mother was there for her and you weren\u2019t. She\u2019s growing up, you\u2019re missing it, and your absences, even though they\u2019re due to you working your butt off to hold things together, will have long-term consequences on your relationship w/ your daughter.  \n\n\nAlso, your mortgage is the absolute WORST payment you could be late on. Being 30 days late will tank your credit rating, and if you can even get loans in the future you\u2019ll get worse interest rates.  And are you saving for retirement? Your child\u2019s education? Is your wife\u2019s HOBBY more important than those things?  Is SHOPPING?\n\nYour wife needs to start living in reality, and you should stop overextending yourself so that she doesn\u2019t have to. If she\u2019s not willing to make the necessary changes, and NOW, then you (just you) have some really big decisions to make.",

It's also not a profession unless you make enough to cover said horse, stable, vets, etc. It's a hobby. One of the most expensive ones a person can have. The majority of ppl in this profession are incredibly wealthy. \n\nDo you know you can lease a horse, which is a lot cheaper. \n\nYou need to have a serious conversation because your family can not afford the horse. That's the reality. Mortgage payments trump horse.\n\nI know this because my niece is an equestrian.  I know the costs associated, and it's ridiculous.  She competes, and the only ppl there are rich and well off. \n\nI believe ppl should pursue their passions, but not at the expense of those around them. \n\nOnce again, if she's not ahead of her costs, it's a hobby. It's only a profession when you make money from it.\n\nIf she's 41 and not competing at a professional level by now, she never will.

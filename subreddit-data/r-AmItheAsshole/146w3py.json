We chose a location and booked our flights. A few days later, her boyfriend (m24) called me and asked if it was cool if he joined us, since he always wanted to go to the same location. I said it was cool, since I knew both of them for many years and never had a problem with him. However, the two of them suddenly wanted to change the whole plan and our city trip quickly became a road trip. They made all the big decisions alone and I was only asked after. Also, I have to mention that I don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license but both of them do, so it was clear from the start I couldn\u2019t drive. \n\n\r  \nOn the very first day of our trip, my friend yelled at me for not having a driver\u2019s license. Again, we\u2019ve known each other for 12 years, so she obvs knew it from the start and it was also discussed several times that the 2 of them would have to do the driving. While driving, the two of them would constantly fight and yell at each other while I was sitting in the back. Whenever I wanted to suggest something, they told me that I had no right to decide, cause I wasn\u2019t driving. \n\n\r  \nAlso, I had just started a new relationship a few weeks before the trip &amp; a few days into the trip, I noticed that my boyfriend was behaving weirdly whenever I texted him. \r  \nI called him and asked what was going on &amp; eventually he told me that he was diagnosed with cancer, but didn\u2019t want to tell me while I was gone cause he wanted me to enjoy my trip. I was obviously shocked and wanted to be with him. I had a really bad time during my trip, cause both my best friend and her bf were excluding me &amp; my bf was very sick. \n\n\r  \nI told my friends that my bf had cancer and asked if they were ok if I went home a few days early, to be with him. They both understood and said it was fine. \r  \nOn the drive to our last destination, I started to cry thinking of my bf. My friend lost it when she saw this and started to yell that crying wouldn\u2019t cure him and that I should instead help them with the GPS, since I wasn\u2019t any help driving. She then yelled that she knew that my bf has cancer but other people had difficult stuff going on too, like she herself, who had problems at work.\n\n\r  \nI was extremely hurt by her words and that she was comparing my bf\u2019s health to her trouble at work. I told her that I was done with her and booked a separate hotel room for the last location. She later apologized over text but I ignored her messages and went back home. AITA for cutting her off and leaving?\r  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

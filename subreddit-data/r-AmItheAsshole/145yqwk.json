We got him in 2021 when he was 7, as we didn't want to adopt a kitten due to our full time jobs.\n\nMy parents live 40 miles away in my home city and have invited us to stay as I've booked time off for family birthdays, possibly overnight. My mum has offered to pick us up (we don't drive due to us both being epileptic) and bring Ollie but we're against the idea.\n\nHe's an indoor cat, as we live in an apartment above a pizza shop and it goes directly onto a main road. He was indoors only in our old house too, due to the high amount of foxes in the area (and too many cats going missing)\n\nWe brought him before and he was incredibly nervous, he wouldn't come out of our room and the front door closing scared him every time. We suspect he was also having abandonment fears as he was in the shelter for 6 months before we adopted him.\n\nWe're going to arrange for someone to pop in and feed him, clean out his litter tray etc \n\nMy mum thinks I'm being ridiculous, and says \"cats are resilient\" etc but I don't want to put him through that stress again.\n\nAITA?",

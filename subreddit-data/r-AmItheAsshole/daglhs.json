    "postText": "So my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. She was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. She was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn\u2019t lift a finger to go visit her. \n\nI tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. He said no. And my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. I spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he\u2019d have to fly over to her country too. Which is fair enough. \n\nHe said no, he didn\u2019t want to fly or travel anywhere. My son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. \n\nLast week, he told us she\u2019s dumped him. I went on her fb page as we\u2019re all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she\u2019s upset it didn\u2019t work out but these things happen, so we\u2019re on good terms) and looks like she\u2019s with a new guy already. Me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. \n\nI confessed to them both that I actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. He did not treat her properly and I hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. I said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. \n\nWife and son are very upset that I said this. Very very upset and my wife says I am being horrible. \n\nAITA? I stand by what I said.",

If he is this lazy and has no plans to travel, what's his plan for leaving the house?  Living with parents is great to save money but he doesn't seem the type so far to actually get up and get out eventually.",

I lived there for a while.\n\n\n\nSometimes cross country flights can be as cheap as 50 bucks if you book in advance. More than affordable working part time/ weekends once a month or so. Like Berlin to Paris is 46 bucks. Or Hamburg to Munich is like 36 bucks",

I knew he had to be a man child based on that alone\n\nEdit- I think lots of people are only reading the first part of the comment. I know lots of teens are in long distance relationships, I just don\u2019t buy that a ton of them get to frequently fly back and forth across the country to see each other because of time and money constraints. The people who reply and say that they were in that situation are likely exceptions to the rule\n\nEdit 2- Alright I get it plenty of you had either enough time or money or rich enough parents to have long distance relationships where you routinely traveled to see your partner. That still isn\u2019t the reality for most people. Just because you\u2019ve personally experienced something, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the norm for everybody.\n\nI\u2019m very happy for all of you who had long distance relationships that worked out and for those of you who were fortunate enough to be able to travel long distances to see each other frequently but most of the people replying still only say they saw each other a couple of times a year as opposed to the monthly visits mentioned in the OP",

If they were 15 and visiting their gf/bf, I'd assume they'd be staying with the other kid's parents. I definitely wouldn't send a kid to another country to *be* on their own.\n\nMy parents (when we lived in the UK) sent my brother to the USA by himself to spend a month with our Aunt and Uncle when he was 15, then they did the same for me when I was 14. Wife and I (now living in the USA) plan on turning this into a tradition and sending our kid to visit my brother (still in the UK) for a month when ours turns 14/15. My nephew is almost 15 and we're trying to get them to send him over here for a month.\n\nAnyway, my only point is that a 14/15yr old being sent to another country \"on their own\" isn't that crazy imo, so long as they're not going to *stay* \"on their own\" when they get there.",

If gf is the one making all of the travel and bf is not only *not* doing any travel, but *refusing* to, then bf is signaling that he is not going to put in as much effort as gf.  That\u2019s very problematic; a relationship cannot be that one-sided. The travel is really just a symptom of a bigger issue.",

I was in a very similar situation with a guy who never took our relationship seriously despite over 4 years together. He refused to move forward in our lives together and, while we were long distance for a year, even told me to cancel a trip I had planned to see him because he was \"too busy.\" \n\nI didn't know how to break up with him, but meeting someone else ended up being kind of what I needed to understand that he wasn't right for me.  It probably looked like we were together before I broke up, but we weren't - I had just found someone perfect for me after nearly 5 years of dragging it out with the wrong person.",

She found someone that actually treated her right and that was the push she needed to dump OP's son. I mean, she also could have cheated, and we could speculate all day, but your scenario is the thought that came to my mind.\n\nEither way, OP is NTA. Sounds like their kid could use a personaity makeover. There's nothing wrong with not liking to travel, but you have to make compromises and sacrifices in a relationship. It's a two-person gig.\n\nI have a buddy that HATES traveling and leaving the house. He likes to chill at home and play video games with his buds. But he still moved to an entirely different country for his now-wife. Gave up having his friends and family close so he could be with her (she owns a company so she couldn't really move as easily as him). That's how you know a relationship will work. OP's son needs a reality check.",

You can feel single because you can't visit and snuggle with the one you love every day or even several times a week (living apart but within short driving distance).

The problem is that his mother fucking ruined him. She enabled his natural shyness until he\u2019ll barely talk unless your a relative or someone he\u2019s known since childhood. She also pushed him to eat his feelings and only ever cooked junk. He can hardly leave the house without having a full on panic attack, and with a few exceptions (me, my sister, one or two other girls), he cannot even make eye contact- let alone talk to a woman 18-60. Thank God he has a great on-line job... still lives with mommy at 45... doesn\u2019t know how to: cook (besides microwaved crap), clean, do laundry, pay bills... I once taught him how to make hamburger helper, and it was like a revelation to him. His mom got mad at me for making her boy do women\u2019s work... I hate his mom so much.\n\n\nDespite totally seeing the toxic way her mom raised her brother, my ex-friend is raising her sons the exact same way... it\u2019s why we aren\u2019t friends anymore. I couldn\u2019t watch it happen again. Being the worst, psycho helicopter mom ever, never letting a kid explore, be by themselves, problem solve, or suffer consequences is pretty fucking abusive.",

But otherwise we play the parent card and make him do something so he\u2019s not sitting in his room, playing video games 24/7. I mean, I\u2019m a shy introvert and mostly like being home, but I also push myself to do new things or meet new people because my parents pushed me as a kid. It\u2019s all about balance but you shouldn\u2019t feel bad if you give him little pushes to get out into the world and face a challenge. It\u2019ll help him learn how to handle it before he\u2019s out in the world on his own.",

Did she give a reason for the break up, like a truthful reason?\n\nTL:DR Someone needs to tell him the truth or he will not grow up\n\nYou are NTA, my questions are based on a similar but different experience. I was dating a girl (both 25 both living with are parents, I was looking for a new job. She was finishing school). Basically it boiled down to I was living with my parents as roommates while looking for a house/job. She was being treated like a 16 year old by her parents. She would not stand up to them and they caused a lot of issues. I would tell my parents no on stuff but it never caused issues. Because she has always been treated like a child, she was a doormat to basically everyone and wouldnt communicate, and if she had her way we would have lived next door to her Dad (in a town I told her I would not live in, mainly do to job prospects and it being a not so good place). When I ended it, I said we both have things we need to work on and grow. We cannot do that together, it is something we will need to do ourselves. A few months later we talked again, she wanted the reason and that is when I told her the truth that it was difficult being with someone who cannot communicate (she would get quite and upset but never say anything), that it was always about her Dad and I felt like I was always after the fact. She wouldnt let me help and I worried about her. There was stuff I could fix but she wouldnt let me because it would piss off her Dad (like fixing her car). So I had to worry about he car breaking and her getting hurt. It was draining. I think she is doing better now, because it was a wake up call.",

We don't know much about your son's mental state so I'm not making any assumptions...just giving you a cautionary tale.\n\nu/inappropriatedress77, I'm going to speak from experience here.\n\nI was entirely unmotivated when I was younger...and honestly, depressed.  My girlfriend (my first love) finally had enough after 3 years and dumped me.  It was devastating.  I went from merely being depressed to suicidal.  I slept 16 hours a day.  I told everyone I was fine...when nothing could have been further from the truth.  The only reason I didn't kill myself is I didn't want to hurt my parents...but if I had felt I was a burden to them, it would have been all over.\n\nAs I'm not the same man today I was then, I can't really blame her for doing it...I would have dumped me if I was in her shoes back then.  She was more ambitious.  She had goals.  I had nothing to offer in terms of a future.\n\nThat said, I finally went to counseling and got my crap together.  In 10 years I made a total 180...became a highly motivated guy, successful career, a father...yadda yadda.  It didn't happen overnight...it took time...but I was moving forward.   I don't recognize the kid I was back then...but it's part of my past and it's also why I stay motivated some 30 years later.  I feel like I wasted 10 years of my life so I'm always playing catch up.  :D\n\nWhile your son's girlfriend was perfectly justified in dumping him, I think your son really needs to know that you love and support him...but if his lack of motivation goes beyond that relationship, he probably needs some professional help.\n\nJust my 2 cents.  Good luck to you and your family.",

But when I finally stood up for myself i gave him six months to do his part. Arrange therapy for us together, for himself, put in an effort.  \nDuring this time i got a new job (to support his ass in college which he was flunking). There was a guy who immediatly took an interest in me.  He was the one teaching me the job, he invited me at the group table at lunch.  When he was flirting i told him to stop because i was in a relationship. \nBut my ex did nothing those months.  And the other guy clearing was putting in effort.  I never saw him outside of work, but he was making it very clear he was into me. \nSo when lazy ex was surprised because i dumped him after those six months, things moved fast with new guy.  \nVery fast. \nWithin a year we were married and had a baby.  Now were around 8 or 9 years together and have three kids.  \nI was accused by ex of cheating. He even called my parents to tell them? And he said I wasn't putting in the effort because i dumped him and didn't even had couples therapy with him.  When I reminded him that he had 6 months to arrange that, he was just starting to accuse me of something else. \nVery nasty.  \nBut whatever, i am happy now.  Our marriage isn't perfect but we talk and both put in effort.  No counceling needed because we listen to eachother. I never cheated, but those six months seeing him doing nothing to fight for us... \nIt isn't black and white",

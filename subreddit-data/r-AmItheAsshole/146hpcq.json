    "postText": "Sorry if formatting is off, I\u2019m on mobile. \n\nMy wife &amp; I have a 12 year old (my stepdaughter) and a 10 month old baby. My wife is a lovely, talented and hard working SAHM. I work full time and support us financially. I\u2019m out the door by 8 and home around 5:30 Since we have had our 10 month old, as soon as I get home from work I\u2019m on kid duty. She\u2019ll cook us an amazing dinner, I clean up kitchen and she\u2019ll go relax for a few hours. This is when I have my bonding/play time with the kids. I also do the bed time routine with everyone since she\u2019s been handling them all day. \n\nI\u2019m not blind to the fact that 99% of the time me going to work is much easier than handling a baby all day. I respect the hell out of her for being able to be there for the kids and create such a wonderful home. She also gets up with the baby (once per night) during the week so I can be well rested for work. She\u2019s an MVP. \n\nShe has dubbed the weekends her days off. I get up with the baby, I handle the kids all weekend, I end up doing a little bit of cleaning (whatever I can squeeze in while watching the baby) and we do all of our going out on the weekends like grocery shopping. While I play Mr. Mom she sleeps in, spends most of the day reading or watching TV and just hanging out. \n\nI\u2019m reaching a point where I\u2019m getting burnt out, I have next to no personal time, the most sleep I get is when I\u2019m getting up for work. I just feel like I need a good day or two to recharge and I\u2019m good. I told my wife that and it didn\u2019t go well. Needless to say she told me I get to sleep all week and she needs the weekends, I said I\u2019m asking for one day on The Weeknd and I\u2019ll get up during the week one day to make up for it. She didn\u2019t go for it, she enjoys her weekends.\n\nAm I wrong for wanting a day every now and again to sleep in and have some personal time to relax for a couple hours? I could see it going both ways.",

            "comment": "SAHM (mostly) here.\n\nNTA.\n\nContext:\nMy husband does a lot on the weekends because I do my part time work + kids 7AM - 4:30PM (2-3 days) and 7AM-10PM (opposite 2-3 days).\n\nYeah - this is not a good division of labor.\n\nBe factual when discussing it.\n\n\u201cWife - do you feel like I appreciate all you do here?\u201d Hopefully you get a yes.\n\n\u201cGood. That is a relief for me to hear because I value you and your contributions to the family so much.\n\nBut - I am struggling. Here\u2019s why: You work X to Y while I\u2019m at work as well (be sure to account for your commute into her time). Then we both work together to tackle the evenings from X to Y. You are rocking the dinner and I do clean up. We tag team the kids. Through here, we are about even minus my commute and my lunch break.\n\nBut then I tackle bedtime with the kids so you can have down time. That\u2019s adding X hours to my day. While the first 60 minutes are to balance the load compared to our work days\u2026the other X minutes aren\u2019t. Then I man the weekend for the most part with tacks in another Y hours for the week.\n\nThis difference is why I am feeling frustration. While i don\u2019t answer to a tiny human, I do still answer to coworkers and bosses. It\u2019s why I need a change to being more balance. \n\nDo you have any ideas of what that could look like?\u201d\n\nSee what she says.\n\nIf she\u2019s still anti change , then ask her what happens if your resentment grows and begins to poison the marriage.\n\nPS: She\u2019s getting downtime with a 10 month old. It\u2019s just hard because you are interrupted all the time. She likely doom scrolls as a result and therefore doesn\u2019t feel like a break vs getting an hour to read or whatever.",

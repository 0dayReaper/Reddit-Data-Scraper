If it is, do you know the rationale for it? \n\nYou can ask her to swap FD for the baseball game, but I doubt she\u2019s gonna give it to you. Take the game, it\u2019ll be a nice activity with your kids. \n\nHow old are your kids, maybe they can mention to their mom that they want to see you more.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nYou can read my bio for more info, but normally my 3 kids and I get to visit 4 times a year here in Japan - at our birthdays for a few hours to at most 5 days/visit. Japanese custody laws at its finest. Been divorced just over 5 years now and haven\u2019t had a Father\u2019s Day since we were separated in 2017. I didn\u2019t expect it this year either but my nephew whom my kids love (their cousin) from the States is visiting and their mother approved a visit for June 10th. Due to my nephew\u2019s plans changing, it was postponed to the 18th which happens to be FD. But soon my nephew changed his plans, which was fine. I thought FD was still on w/o him because I was able to \u201calso\u201d confirm with their mother a July 2 baseball game in Tokyo. She didn\u2019t say the 18th was cancelled, until yesterday, saying it wasn\u2019t about FD just my nephew\u2019s visit. She\u2019s adamant that only the 2nd is now available due to \u201cplans\u201d made on FD already. Yes, she was gracious to schedule and reschedule, but I still asked for FD with the kids and will sacrifice the baseball tickets giving them to her so she can take the kids and maybe her own father to the game (w/o me and my kids\u2019 step mom). AITA to do so and request spending a few hours on FD with my kids? Sad in Japan.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

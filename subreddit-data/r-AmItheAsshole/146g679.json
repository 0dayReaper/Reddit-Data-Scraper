Your opinion matters. \n\nAsk him to bring his statement to therapy: \"He said that I was lying to him and that I was ignoring him for a reason.\"  A healthy relationship means you won't always agree and accusing you of lying is not appropriate. He needs kinder communication skills.  You completely supported and sacrificed for him and it lead to this? Best to you!",

You're fine with continuing a schedule that ensures you don\u2019t see or acknowledge your husband (which is a fine opinion to have by the way). Your husband feels like he needs to not see you at all to develop a sense of self and then feels unwanted by you when the routine switches back. I guess I just mostly don\u2019t understand anyone\u2019s actions here so it\u2019s difficult to make any judgment beyond \u201cmaybe it\u2019s not worth it.\u201d",

I don\u2019t stick to a schedule I\u2019ll forget to eat, I\u2019ll get distracted at work, I\u2019ll spend 5 hours doing nothing useful, stuff like that.\n\nMy husband Finn (26M) is in therapy; he got a new, experimental therapist. His therapist and Finn sat me down to talk about how he feels like he doesn\u2019t know himself outside of our relationship and it\u2019s defined by me since I have a strong personality. I admit I can be overbearing and a bit bossy but I am working on it. His therapist suggested a sort of breather where we wouldn\u2019t spend time together to let Finn develop his own sense of who he is and what he wants instead of being codependent. \n\nFinn and I spent a lot of time together. we both work from home and are homebodies. Finn and I figured out a new schedule to let him breathe. I moved all my stuff into tour wfh office and he moved his desk to our old bedroom.\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie it was hard at first. I missed my husband but it was for his mental health so I grinned and bore it. I reframed my thinking to only the positive aspects: I could wake up when I wanted, I could make lunch and dinner for myself, I could watch what movies I wanted and read what books I wanted, I could go outside for walks on my own, and shop for my stuff only. Once I started thinking that, it was easier to maintain my schedule.\n\nNow we\u2019re supposed to be back to our old schedule but I\u2019ve found it hard to switch back. Today Finn complained that I spent the entire day in my room/the guest bedroom instead of him and didn\u2019t acknowledge him at all. I told him that switching my schedule from what I had done for months was hard. He said that I was lying to him and that I was ignoring him for a reason. I got frustrated and went to my room.

It\u2019s normal for companies to take a template from the internet for their website, and replace the Latin with the actual text. If I was researching a company and I saw that they forgot, I would think they are a very new company and be less likely to use them. \n\n\nYou also looked into other options, which if everyone was acting professionally they would have agreed is a good idea regardless, but they are taking it personally because it\u2019s a family company. Not choosing that company wouldn\u2019t have been an insult, but they wouldn\u2019t have seen it that way. They made it personal.",

With your long working hours to maintain a website people mostly use to look up the phone number is not the most important thing to do and gets delayed from day to day as long as you have work to do. \n\nAs the quality of your website has nearly nothing to do with the quality of your actual work (in small towns its often more like the contrary, the flashier the website the lower the skills), you are always very busy.\n\nNow you hear from your son that they want you to print their yearbook. He did not \"advertise\", he told his friends his father has a printing shop, as everybody would have done here. You promise to make a good offer.\n\nBefore even getting the informations you need to actually make an offer, you hear from your son that the one in charge thinks you do a bad job because of your crude homepage and started to look for offers out of town/online/whereever.  \n\nAs there is more than enough work to do and working with a someone who started to mistrust your working skills before he even spoke to you or came to your shop once sounds tiresome, you decide that you are not so very interested in this any more.\n\nNo offer, please go elswhere. Good luck.\n\nWhat OP should have done is get the offer, check out one or two other offers, and, as soon as he realised it was a very good offer indeed, gladly accept it. Afterwards, if he still wanted to make it his problem, he could have told his friend that it is a pity the homepage does not live up to their excellent work and maybe they could change it together as a kind of reward.\n\nYou are not an AH, but I think you need to learn an awful lot and yes, I think you lost your team a good chance and probably some money.",

He\u2019s not the only printer, you all will be ok. A mentor once told me if the courtship is rocky, then the marriage will be hell.

If a printing company cannot proofread their OWN WEBSITE, how can they be expected to pay close attention to your very large job of a yearbook layout?  \n\nA reputable company, even a brand new one, would have been embarrassed by their mistake, thanked you for pointing it out to them, and maybe offered you some sort of discount or bonus for your trouble.  I mean, mistakes happen sometimes, right? Fixing some website text takes a few minutes, and it saves the company the same embarrassment from another potential client seeing the same mistake.\n\nBut NOOOooo, this friend\u2019s father goes into full pearl-clutching mode, \u201cHow dare you criticize my nonsense text and look for more conscientious printers?!\u201d  \n\nThe nonsense text by itself wasn\u2019t a red flag, but the printer\u2019s reaction to your questioning it sure is.  I know your colleagues are upset with you now, because I suspect this guy had been offering to do this yearbook layout and printing job on the cheap.  However, if the dude can\u2019t fix a minor mistake on his own website, it doesn\u2019t speak well of his layout skills.\n\nYou probably dodged a metaphorical bullet!\n\nETA NTA",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\n\nHey Reddit, I recently found myself in a bit of a sticky situation and I need your judgment to determine if I'm the asshole in this scenario. Here's what went down:\n\nI'm part of a committee responsible for organizing our school's yearbook. As part of our preparations, we needed to find a printing company to handle the job. One of my classmates, let's call him Alex, told us that his father owns a printing website and could potentially offer us a good deal.\n\nNaturally, we were interested, so I decided to check out the website to get an idea of their services. To my surprise, I noticed that the website still had Latin text on it, which I thought gave the impression of being unprofessional and unserious. Concerned about the potential negative impact on our yearbook, I decided to bring it up with Alex.\n\nI approached Alex and explained my concerns about the Latin text on the website. I emphasized that it might deter potential clients and give the impression that the business isn't taking things seriously. I thought I was doing the right thing by offering constructive criticism and trying to help improve the website.\n\nIn the meantime, since I hadn't heard back from Alex's father's company, I began looking for a backup printing company just to ensure that we would have a reliable option if needed. However, when Alex found out about my search for alternatives, he became even more upset. He felt that I was undermining his father's business and trying to replace them without giving them a fair chance.\n\nAs a result, Alex promptly informed his father about our conversation, including my concerns about the Latin text and my search for a backup company. To my surprise, his father was deeply offended by my remarks and the fact that I was looking for alternatives. Consequently, he decided to withdraw his offer to print our yearbooks.\n\nNow, the committee is blaming me for losing the printing company, and I'm starting to question whether I was in the wrong. They argue that I should have kept my concerns to myself.\n\nI feel like I was just trying to help and prevent any potential issues for our yearbook. However, the negative outcome has made me wonder if I crossed a line and should have handled things differently.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for telling my classmate about the Latin text on his father's printing website, resulting in the loss of our yearbook printing company?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I decided to bring it up with Alex.\n\n&gt;I approached Alex and explained my concerns about the Latin text on the website. I emphasized that it might deter potential clients and give the impression that the business isn't taking things seriously. I thought I was doing the right thing by offering constructive criticism and trying to help improve the website.\n\nThis is correct. Thats super unprofessional. A professional business would have also taken this criticism kindly and tried to improve things. Hell they probably should have even thanked you for mentioning something they can improve to get a bigger customer base. \n\nIt says a lot that instead their response was to refuse service and act insulted. Again super, super unprofessional behavior. \n\nId be glad you have backups. Id not want to use a service for something so important especially when they are so unprofessional.",

Of course at my scale it's not necessary at all to really worry about the website but I'll be damned if anything has my name on it and doesn't reflect the quality my customers expect.\n\nPlus this guy was leading you on and being completely unprofessional with response time. Between the website and that it's clear this guy doesn't take things seriously and it was smart to start shopping for other places, he just acted like a child about it. Have I been perfect with all clients? No and guess what? I paid the price for it, he should learn like 8 did.",

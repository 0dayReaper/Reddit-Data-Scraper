    "postText": "I feel a little bit like an AH for this, but I also think I am not completely wrong so I need to know at least one outsider's point of view on the situation.\r  \n\r  \nMy mother had known this woman (Mary) since I was young, they met through me and one of her kids going to school together and becoming close friends. Despite this, they were never really close and they had the \"parent you know only because of your kid\" kind of relationship.\r  \n\r  \nThree years ago Mary was diagnosed with a final-stage tumor and she decided to go the home assistance direction instead of staying at the hospital with COVID becoming a thing. She asked my mother for help around the house, with groceries, and with the kids and they obviously became closer.\r  \n\r  \nSadly Mary passed away not long after. She had to leave behind four children who are still quite young (the one from school is a young adult, two are teenagers and one is in elementary school). and she had my mother promise she would keep helping them during the grieving process.\r  \n\r  \nThree years later, my mother still helps them every day. She goes to their house, cleans, and cooks for them. She also helps them with their personal life and basically became \"an adoptive mother\" (her words) for them.\r  \n\r  \nI think that is amazing they have someone to count on. I cannot imagine what it would be like to have a parent die. But at the same time, it feels like crap.\r  \n\r  \nI rarely see or talk to my mother because she is always either working or at their house and when she is home she is too tired or has stuff to do or I am not home. It has started to sound like she knows more about these children's lives than mine. She barely asks me questions and mostly talks about them.\r  \n\r  \nIt's a stupid example but some days ago she was able to describe one of them's ideal partner and life and then when it came to describing mine she was completely wrong despite me describing them multiple times. She often confuses their words for mines and mines for theirs.\r  \n\r  \nI have told her I feel like this multiple times, told her that she is not their mother but their mother's friend, that she should stop acting like a \"stepmother\" and that at some point they need to be able to go on with their lives (which I think may be an AH thing to say, but still true) and their father should step in more. Every time she tells me that I am being immature and unreasonable, that they need her because they don't have a mother anymore, and that the father never had to be a parent so he doesn't know how to. And I know it's true and I feel like an AH for feeling this way, but I can't help it.\r  \n\r  \nI have seriously considered going to therapy over this because I feel like she is starting to care more for them than me but I also think I may be an AH for not being more understanding.\r  \n\r  \nSo: AITA for telling her to stop acting like a mother to them?",

You are not wrong to say how hurt you feel when she looks right through you as though you're not there because the only people she can see are Mary's children. All of that is valid.\n\nAnd her response (they need her because they don't have a mother any more) ignores the fact that it's almost like *you* don't have a mother any more! Your mother is not dead, but her interest and her energies are elsewhere.\n\nYou're not the AH for any of that. You're not the AH for telling her you need more than she is giving you.\n\nWhere you may be in danger of crossing the line into AH territory is in telling her to stop taking care of Mary's children. You don't have the right to demand that. You wish she would, I wish she would, but you can't make her. It's a realization she will have to arrive at on her own.\n\nYou say you have considered going to therapy. I think that would be a very good idea. With your mother, if she will consent to it, but if she won't, then go alone.\n\n*but I also think I may be an AH for not being more understanding.*\n\nI think you've been very understanding.

Your mother would probably never agree to stop doing anything at all for Mary's children, but I think she could be gently persuaded to cut back a little, in the interests of balancing your needs (and her need for some rest!) against their needs.\n\nRe: therapy. If everyone who could benefit from therapy said \"I won't go, because there are people who have it worse\", no one would go to therapy.\n\nTherapy is for when there is something dysfunctional in your life - your thoughts, your interactions with other people, whatever - that is causing you distress, and you need the help of a professional to work out how to fix it. It is absolutely valid in your case.\n\nIt sounds like your mother would never go with you. OK then, go alone. Your only difficulty may be if you're financially dependent on her, and she refuses to pay for therapy.\n\nYou don't mention your father. Is he in the picture at all?

I think you need to express that you feel sort of neglected emotionally\u2026 it is 1,000% reasonable for you to feel that way. When a parent starts to know more about someone else\u2019s kids than their own, there is obvious signs of neglect to the relationship with their own child and favoritism. \n\nWhen you talk to her, use \u201cI feel..\u201d statements. Using \u201cyou\u201d may cause her to get defensive and feel like she is being attacked, in a sense, which you don\u2019t want. I feel statements help the other person to understand where you are, understand your thought and your feelings without feeling like you are blaming or attacking them. Also, try and write down all of your \u201cI feel\u2026\u201d statements before you talk to her. That way you have something to go back to if the conversation steers in a different direction. It will also help prevent the use of \u201cyou\u201d statements.\n\nI really hope this helps and I hope you are able to get through to her. Regardless, if you are considering therapy, I say go for it! I\u2019ve been in therapy for over three years now and it has made an incredible difference in my life.\n\nEdit: The strategies of \u201cI feel\u201d statements are something I learned in therapy and I continue to work on them all the time. They are incredibly difficult to integrate into life, especially when we are emotionally fired up. Practice makes better. Sending hugs \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",

If you want to make a point you can say something like \"Actually I know exactly how it feels to not have a mother\" if she tries to guilt trip you about Mary's kids' situation. If you really wanna get petty with it start calling your mother by her first name \ud83e\udd23. \n\nAlso, it's so sexist to think that the father can't do those because he's \"never had to parent before\". Your mom is basically enabling him to not learn parent his own kids, at your expense.\n\nDefinitely recommend therapy. Since you're not a minor you can just make an appointment on your own, if transportation is an issue telehealth is an option, sounds like your mom is never home anyways so it should be easy enough to just do it behind her back lol.",

Despite this, they were never really close and they had the \"parent you know only because of your kid\" kind of relationship.\r  \n\r  \nThree years ago Mary was diagnosed with a final-stage tumor and she decided to go the home assistance direction instead of staying at the hospital with COVID becoming a thing. She asked my mother for help around the house, with groceries, and with the kids and they obviously became closer.\r  \n\r  \nSadly Mary passed away not long after. She had to leave behind four children who are still quite young (the one from school is a young adult, two are teenagers and one is in elementary school). and she had my mother promise she would keep helping them during the grieving process.\r  \n\r  \nThree years later, my mother still helps them every day. She goes to their house, cleans, and cooks for them. She also helps them with their personal life and basically became \"an adoptive mother\" (her words) for them.\r  \n\r  \nI think that is amazing they have someone to count on. I cannot imagine what it would be like to have a parent die. But at the same time, it feels like crap.\r  \n\r  \nI rarely see or talk to my mother because she is always either working or at their house and when she is home she is too tired or has stuff to do or I am not home. It has started to sound like she knows more about these children's lives than mine. She barely asks me questions and mostly talks about them.\r  \n\r  \nIt's a stupid example but some days ago she was able to describe one of them's ideal partner and life and then when it came to describing mine she was completely wrong despite me describing them multiple times. She often confuses their words for mines and mines for theirs.\r  \n\r  \nI have told her I feel like this multiple times, told her that she is not their mother but their mother's friend, that she should stop acting like a \"stepmother\" and that at some point they need to be able to go on with their lives (which I think may be an AH thing to say, but still true) and their father should step in more. Every time she tells me that I am being immature and unreasonable, that they need her because they don't have a mother anymore, and that the father never had to be a parent so he doesn't know how to. And I know it's true and I feel like an AH for feeling this way, but I can't help it.\r  \n\r  \nI have seriously considered going to therapy over this because I feel like she is starting to care more for them than me but I also think I may be an AH for not being more understanding.\r  \n\r  \nSo: AITA for telling her to stop acting like a mother to them?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I know you said that there is always a reason that it doesn't happen but if possible on your end try to put just a bit more effort into it at least while you still live in the same house.  \n\nOnce you move out then do what you see fit. \n\nBut quick question, did your mother lose a parent when she was young? Maybe that's why she feels such a need to continue to be there?  \n\nOr is your mom weak minded and easy to manipulate? I find it strange that her and this woman were just friends because their kids knew each other(cause it doesn't sound like you're still close to the child your age) and your mom was asked and agreed to run this woman's household while she was transitioning overz",

It\u2019s understandable you miss your mom. It\u2019s understandable that you need to talk to your mother about the impact on your relationship. \n\nBut abandon these children you love, that you see as your children, because I matter more - makes you TA too. \n\nYour mother is grieving the loss of her friend. She is doing for those children what she no doubt hoped someone would do for you if she passed (do you know your parent\u2019s plans for you if they died when you were a child? Not all families talk about this sort of stuff  - but your mother probably did have plans, so this is something she has likely thought about). \n\nThere\u2019s grief interacting with obligation in her reaction. There\u2019s also a chance that she feels appreciated for what she\u2019s doing by those kids - and perhaps more appreciated than she did/does from you. \n\nYou are an adult. Chances are you have drawn away from her as you\u2019ve grown up (normal and healthy) - and you don\u2019t need her the way those kids do. If you are an only child - then this feels so much worse because you were never used to sharing her. \n\nIf you tried to look on these kids as step siblings that will be part of your mother\u2019s life, and make an effort there - you might find this easier.",

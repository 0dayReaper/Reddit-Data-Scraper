So this is a blended family they had kids from previous marriages and combined what I thought was a good family.so to note by \u201cblood\u201d im only related to my grandfather but I didn\u2019t know that until late teens but nothing changes that is my parents regardless.\n\nMy grandma passed away December 2021 so everyone got a piece of her ashes in some way me and my grandfather had the main urn at our house . He passed away in January of this year so all his stuff was left to me. Now my aunt which is my grandma Daughter we butt head cause she has this attitude of she wants control and better than everyone. So I didn\u2019t like how she would invalidate my feelings at every moment about both deaths. Randomly this week she told my cousin she was sending someone to my house to take the ashes and if i didn\u2019t give it to her she was going call the police no conversation or nothing I told her could we split she so this isn\u2019t up for debate. \n\nSo she was coming to the house i wasn\u2019t going be home so I took the ashes cause I didn\u2019t want to come back and it just was gone I wanted to have conversations like adults and figure out what was both happy for us both. Everyone treated me I was the Antichrist they literally were trying say oh I took the urn to hold it over her head to be petty .she isn\u2019t your mom you have no say your not number 1 in your grandma life  you aren\u2019t blood  we don\u2019t care if she raised you she isn\u2019t your mom I\u2019m her only daughter etc. \n\nit\u2019s so i irritating cause I feel like I\u2019m the only adult and they are all 20 40 years older them just being awful to me and trying to switch around the entire situation on me . So aita for taking the urn so it wouldn\u2019t be gone when I got home so we could have an actual compromise.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In short, they\u2019re terrible clients who are ALWAYS going to give you the runaround. I get you really like the children, but the children aren\u2019t paying the bill, are they?  Cut \u2018em loose before they cost you anymore money because as it stands, you\u2019re essentially paying them to tutor their children.",

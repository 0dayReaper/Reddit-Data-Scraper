    "postText": "Hi all, I (24M) returned to my parents house two weeks ago for my mother birthday. All didn't ended as expected because I had a strong arguing with my parents about my situation, who ended with my mother crying.\n\nLet me explain : I suffer from social anxiety (mainly caused by bullying that followed me from elementary school to high school), outside of that I also stutter (probably also caused by bullying). Because of that I just have no social life : never had any friend, never went to a party, never kissed or even flirted with a girl, ect...\n\nI had years of therapy and speech therapy (for stuttering), but nothing helped. So I just finally accepted that I wasn't cut out for living in society, that the best thing for me was to stay alone and not bother other people. That life is a zero-sum game where, sadly, I've already lost all my chips.\n\nSo I stay locked at home, spending my evenings listening to music and reading forums like subreddit /loneliness, the only few places where I feel like someone can understand me.\n\nBut sadly, my parents don't see it that way. They can't understand that some people can be rejected by everyone, and can't understand that's the case with me.\n\nIn this argument, what \"closed the debate\" was when I said, totally exasperated that after 2 hours they still didn't understand, that if they were disappointed with my life, they can just forgot me and keep only my little brother (20M) who is, as opposite of me, a total winner in every aspect of life (friends, studies, girls, ect...). Which made my mother burst into tears.\n\nSo here I am, asking if this last line make me an asshole in this situation ?",

At the same time, unless she was crying in order to manipulate you, and not genuinely sad, she\u2019s not A H when her adult child says to forget them because they believe they have nothing to give to others. It seems likely to me that she\u2019d feel grief about that and frustration because her experience of you would not be that you have nothing to offer others even if you feel weary and burned by the efforts of interacting socially.  And while you might be feeling pressure from her she is also probably terrified at that finality. \n\nYou mention connecting with other people who experience loneliness, but do you also connect online with people with your music interests?  I believe your suffering is real and you don\u2019t owe anyone interactions but I also believe the barrier to interaction can be framed differently: trauma sucks a lot out of you.",

I don't know who has got you convinced that all medication is terrible, but depression is an actual physical disorder caused by a chemical imbalance in your brain.  Please, please, find a therapist that can explain this better than random people on the internet and help you understand it, preferably one who deals in childhood trauma.  It took me far longer than I'd care to admit to deal with many of the same issues you're talking about in this post and my only regret is that I didn't listen to the people who cared about me sooner and accept real help.",

That is one reason the military is so strong, the common bond that literally forces us to support one another.  \n\nI stayed in the Navy for one contract, got out and for whatever reason joined the US Army.  I loved it and found a home that really really helped me integrate into society.  Believe me I still have issues, but I got out and joined the National Guard where I spent a total of 27 years and retired as a senior NCO.  \n\nI'm not saying its the answer to all lifes problems but it really helped me with my issues.",

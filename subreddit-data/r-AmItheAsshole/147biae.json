    "postText": "Hello, I'm a 20 year old female and my ex is a 21 year old male. We have been living together for around almost 6 months and I have recently broke up with him due to losing interest and for him being very needy of me. I have been friends with his brother, sister and his sisters gf for over a year and I would like to think that we got along perfectly fine as we had no conflict and shared similar interests.\n\nRecently since I broke up with him he started to tell his immediate family and his sister's gf to not invite me to hang outs and activities even though I was good friends with them. It feels like I'm a non existent human being now as I know when they go out for stuff together and are enjoying time together. I currently don't have a working car as of right now so me being around people is kinda a rarity currently and I miss human interaction with other people. What annoys me is that they sometimes say hello to me when they see me but will flat out just ignore me right after and go on to whatever they are doing. I'm pretty pissed in general cause it feels like a slap to the face and that I am just an accessory for what was my boyfriend as I was the one who took him and his brother to his sisters apartment for hangouts as well as other places in general as both of them do not have transportation either.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

They acknowledge that they see you but they are not interested in hanging out.\n\nThese are not your friends, they are your exes friends and family.  They are going to support their friend and brother and that includes not being friends with you.  \n\nYTA",

He has every right to tell people to not invite you, after all you broke up with him. You can\u2019t expect things to go back to normal after a break up, and you need to understand that sometimes things just don\u2019t work out. So stop focusing on your ex and instead focus on making new friendships and moving on from this relationship.",

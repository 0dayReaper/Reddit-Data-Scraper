Most people only remember almost all non family/intimate birthdays through Facebook or if they have a diary - or a coincidental date. It's unfair to be mad at them unless you can off the top of your head remember every single one of their birthdays and consider this normal behaviour.\n\nSecond your husband arranged a concert he knew you wouldn't be interested in but wanted to drag you to *for your birthday?* Unless he arranged another party or outing for you in specific your birthday only comes once per year. There's nothing saying you have to do everything together, but to not care about your birthday at all? And then to not tell his friends?",

Just calmly mention it for next time. \n\nLet's be real, though. The main issue at hand is the concert as a gift. It's either he flopped on the gift, thought you'd enjoy it, but it's not your thing....or he got himself a gift and tried to pass it off as one for you. If it's the latter, you're going to have to decide if that's the kind of man you want as a life partner. \n\nBut, if it's the first, you both have to communicate better. If he thought you'd like it and it's something that he'd really enjoy, it's not reasonable to just assume he wouldn't go. You're absolutely allowed to want to prioritize your birthday, but it's unrealistic to expect your husband to make the connection that your disinterest means he shouldn't go. When you recognized you weren't interested in going, why wasn't your next question, \"Did you still want to go?\" Set your teammate up for success",

Several months prior my husband bought us tickets for a music festival that was to take place on my birthday, despite me saying I wasn\u2019t interested in going (he loves one of the artists headlining). I kind of forgot about it and assumed he would sell the tickets since I wasn\u2019t interested. Fast forward to a few week before my birthday and my parents wanted to take us and some extended family to an MLS (soccer) game for my bday. I\u2019m very interested in this as I enjoy both soccer and spending time with me family. I tell my husband this and we end up having a big spat about it because he wants to go to the music festival.\n\nIn the end, I convince him to go to the game as we would still have time after to see the artist he likes. So that\u2019s what we end up doing. However, when we got to the music festival last night and met up with my husband\u2019s brother, SIL, and the \u201cfriend group\u201d (my husband\u2019s friends through his brother), all of who I\u2019ve know for several years now, none of them knew it was my birthday, I guess. And my husband didn\u2019t tell them. I didn\u2019t even want to go to this thing, none of them care about me, and it\u2019s my birthday. I was/am angry with my husband.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t he tell them to at least say HBD? It didn\u2019t feel good. Am I the asshole for getting mad at my husband about this?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When the time came around, and he still had them, she got upset. \n\nThen the soccer game came up, and he agreed to miss part of the festival to attend it with her, as was right to do. \n\nFinally, when it came time to go to the festival, she decided to get mad at HIM for something other people failed to do. \n\nI was close to giving this an E S H, but her being angry at him for something out of his control made it a Y T A in my book.\n\nAnd, just so you know, I\u2019ve been with the same woman for nearly 27 years, and married to her for 19 of them.

This was clearly an event that he (and his friends and family!) was excited about. It just so happened to coincide with your birthday. Be happy he went to the game with you.",

You can't just assume your partner will drop something entirely when you aren't interested, even when its a schedule conflict.

(summer baby issue! \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8) I often set aside a date to celebrate with specific people or parties, which I suggested to OP in a different thread :-)",

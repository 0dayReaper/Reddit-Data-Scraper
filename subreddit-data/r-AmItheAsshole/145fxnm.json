    "postText": "I 30F am married to my husband 35F for 7 years. For some background, we are immigrants living in a European country for the last 6 years. We have a 1.5M year old. After we moved to the said country, I had visa restrictions and couldn't work for 2 years. Out of 7 years of marriage, those are the 2 years I was financially dependant on my husband. But, we knew it before moving and still did it as it was beneficial to his career. \nSince the beginning, he never did much around the house. I do the cooking, cleaning, scheduling any appointment etc.\n\nHe always had special hobbies that requires special equipment and I always tried to be supportive. I spend most of my income towards household expenses. All the direct debits are on his account, so I send money to him every month after payday.\n\nNow, I had a difficult pregnancy and a planned c-section due to some complications. I did all the chores until one week before my delivery. That is when my mom came and stayed until the baby turned 2 months old.\n\nMy husband did nothing during my mom's stay. Not even hold the baby until I ask. Even after she left, I never got any help even after asking. \nAfter the end of my maternity, I switched to a new company. I still do all the work I used to do plus the baby care. \n\nWe have two dogs, he feed them. I do the rest.\nI got sick 3 months ago. He took care of the baby for a week. Cooked for 5 weeks while I was recovering. During this time, I planned to go to my hometown to my parents place to recover fully. So, I told him that I can't give him any money for this month as I want to purchase plane tickets.\nTo say it did not go well is an understatement. He called me names and said the family can't survive. When I pointed out how it's not true, he said he need money for his hobbies. He pointed out that I have savings, but it was actually to repay some debt we had. He is aware of this and still wanted that money. When I did not agree, he threatened saying he will leave his job. I did not budge so he went ahead and cut my health insurance. When I confronted saying I always contribute, he reminded me that he took care of me when I was jobless and also said if he let this one time go, I might make it a habit. \n\nAll this while i was sick. I felt very bad. Transferred him some money, booked my ticket and came to my parents place. Our son is with me. I did not talk to him for two months and he occasionally messaged me asking how our son is doing.\n\nHe now calls me and asks for money. Says, I am not pulling my weight. I need to give him half of the monthly expenses and I can do anything I want with rest of the money. When I ask about dividing chores, he says he is doing what he can. \nI feel like a SAHM, with an outside job and don't want to contribute anything financially until he starts doing more around the house and be an active parent in our son's life.\nAITA?",

It's one thing to demand money it's another to put you and your child's health at risk if you were in an emergency situation and couldn't get the proper Healthcare or pay for it after out of pocket. This is beyond an unsafe situation, no matter how bad a relationship is going you don't go after someone's health. I strongly worry for you and your child and I think it would be best to get health insurance from your job if possible and to stay with your parents more. Don't give him anymore money it's just fueling his desire to control your life and make you feel threatened if you don't give in. It will only get worse, please for you and your child's safety start thinking of an exit plan.",

For some background, we are immigrants living in a European country for the last 6 years. We have a 1.5M year old. After we moved to the said country, I had visa restrictions and couldn't work for 2 years. Out of 7 years of marriage, those are the 2 years I was financially dependant on my husband. But, we knew it before moving and still did it as it was beneficial to his career. \nSince the beginning, he never did much around the house. I do the cooking, cleaning, scheduling any appointment etc.\n\nHe always had special hobbies that requires special equipment and I always tried to be supportive. I spend most of my income towards household expenses. All the direct debits are on his account, so I send money to him every month after payday.\n\nNow, I had a difficult pregnancy and a planned c-section due to some complications. I did all the chores until one week before my delivery. That is when my mom came and stayed until the baby turned 2 months old.\n\nMy husband did nothing during my mom's stay. Not even hold the baby until I ask. Even after she left, I never got any help even after asking. \nAfter the end of my maternity, I switched to a new company. I still do all the work I used to do plus the baby care. \n\nWe have two dogs, he feed them. I do the rest.\nI got sick 3 months ago. He took care of the baby for a week. Cooked for 5 weeks while I was recovering. During this time, I planned to go to my hometown to my parents place to recover fully. So, I told him that I can't give him any money for this month as I want to purchase plane tickets.\nTo say it did not go well is an understatement. He called me names and said the family can't survive. When I pointed out how it's not true, he said he need money for his hobbies. He pointed out that I have savings, but it was actually to repay some debt we had. He is aware of this and still wanted that money. When I did not agree, he threatened saying he will leave his job. I did not budge so he went ahead and cut my health insurance. When I confronted saying I always contribute, he reminded me that he took care of me when I was jobless and also said if he let this one time go, I might make it a habit. \n\nAll this while i was sick. I felt very bad. Transferred him some money, booked my ticket and came to my parents place. Our son is with me. I did not talk to him for two months and he occasionally messaged me asking how our son is doing.\n\nHe now calls me and asks for money. Says, I am not pulling my weight. I need to give him half of the monthly expenses and I can do anything I want with rest of the money. When I ask about dividing chores, he says he is doing what he can. \nI feel like a SAHM, with an outside job and don't want to contribute anything financially until he starts doing more around the house and be an active parent in our son's life.\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you're living in Europe you can probably get services and support as a single parent. Look around where you live, see if you can find some organizations that help women leave abusive husbands (and yes, what your husband is doing is abuse). They can help you apply for benefits, housing etc. Get a lawyer, file for divorce and try to get full custody (with your husband's lack of interest in your child, that should be possible). You don't have to stay in this relationship and you don't have to go back to your country if you think you'll be ostracized there.",

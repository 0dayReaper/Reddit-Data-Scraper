    "postText": "My boyfriend and his friends decided to put on a band performance at their friends party and have spent the last few weeks practicing for it and we had agreed that I\u2019d accompany him to this party and then afterwards him and I would get food together and watch a movie. Things seemed to be going according to plan until he called me one night saying he had a question for me, to sum it up he explained that his other friend group had expressed interest in going to this party to see him which led my boyfriend to literally try to bribe me with a \u201cnice dinner\u201d if I agreed not to go to the party so instead his friends could come and they \u201ccould have fun\u201d. I made it clear that I was kinda offended by this and it made me feel like the boring second choice and that I didn\u2019t understand why we all can\u2019t just go to which he didn\u2019t really give me a legitimate explanation just the fact that it would be \u201cweird\u201d for me to be in the same place as his friends (this has been an issue in the past) I told him I still wanted to go so he said he\u2019d tell his friends not to go. After he told his friends not to go he proceeded to repeatedly ask me throughout this past week if I still wanted to go which started to irritate me since it was just furthering my feeling that I was the second choice in this situation, I expressed this to him and he kept giving me the same answer about how he\u2019s only joking and I\u2019m not his second choice. Eventually I decided to not go and instead asked if we could still meet up afterwards to eat to which he said yes only for him to now start acting like it\u2019s mandatory for him to eat with his friends and go to their house afterwards, this only led to back and forth arguing on whether or not it\u2019s fair that he prioritizes this whole party over us spending time together since It has been hard to see each other lately due to opposite work schedules combined with his band practices but he thinks I\u2019m just trying to start a fight\nEDIT: Him preferring to spend the whole night with his friends is bothering me even more since he just spent last night with them after leaving work at about 11 pm but when I ask if we can still see each other afterwards he emphasizes that it\u2019s going to be late when he leaves",

I'm pretty sure he's cheating on you. \n\nBut, just in case, you can really test him by asking him for the house address that he's planning on meeting his friends at afterwards. If he asks why, you can say \"just in case if something happens, or if you get too drunk and you need me to come pick you up\". If he refuses to give you the house address, then that's definitely SUS. But if he does give the house address, then you can drop by the place uninvited and act like this was totally planned. If he asks why you showed up, just tell him \"Because I missed you so much.\"",

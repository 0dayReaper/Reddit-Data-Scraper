I think it\u2019s great that they love each other but sometimes the PDA is too much.. AITA for being annoyed that they do so much PDA without a care of who is watching?",

You don't have to look at them, but if they're going to act that way why are they even there? Why go somewhere with a bunch of other people around and then proceed to completely ignore those people in favour of each other? \n\nYou could tell her that it's very hard to engage with her and her BF when they're like that -  their behaviour is exclusive to the point that it prevents you and anyone else from feeling like you can talk to them. Tell her that you want to talk to them. You want to hangout as a group with everyone's equal input, but instead you're left feeling like a voyeur against your will. It's not fun to stand on the sidelines and watch a couple give all their attention to each other only.",

Removing themselves from the situation would often mean just going home which is a bit unfair if they're trying to enjoy a family gathering with other people.

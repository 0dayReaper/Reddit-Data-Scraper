Your friend needs to respect that, not shame you into being what she wants. You did everything right imo \n\nYour friend does sound immature too, not taking any sort of accountability for anything. She could be right that her poor table manners come from living in a single parent household, but that doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t improve them.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (21F) recently met with a friend (22F) whom I haven\u2019t seen in so long, and we decided to go for a trip to catch up. During this trip, somehow every time when we talk she\u2019d gradually become super negative, and shit gets deep real fast. For the first few days of our trip, I would sit there and listen, and I did feel a little sympathetic. \n\nBut then slowly, I grew disgusted with her constant self pitying, and I felt like that was her trying to excuse her actions and behaviours by blaming her flaws on past traumatic/ unfortunate events. For instance, she somehow blamed her poor table manners on her single parent household; and blamed her self esteem issues on an emotionally unstable friend that she texts literally everyday. \n\nSo, on the last day of our trip (the 10th day), of course when she tried to blame whoever or whatever, I felt like I had enough, like I got stuff of my own to deal with too and I\u2019m not blaming anyone, so I straight up told her she was being immature. I also told her I was not her therapist, and that I would not like to engage in conversations like these any further. She didn\u2019t say it straight up but the message she conveyed was that I\u2019m not being a good friend, and that I should be there for her like she\u2019s always there for her emotionally unstable \u201cfriend\u201d. AITA? What should I have done? Should I have sat there and listened to what she had been saying on repeat for the past week?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I would've said (even if it wasnt quite true) something like \"I'm sorry you've been through a lot, I have been through a lot my self and unfortunately I can't handle you discussing your trauma with me so if you have to talk about it when I'm around I can't be around anymore\"",

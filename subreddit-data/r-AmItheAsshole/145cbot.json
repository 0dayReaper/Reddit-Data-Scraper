    "postText": "My wife and I have 3 kids, the eldest is 7 and since her birth we've had 'Lila' as our stay in nanny to help out. She's a nice lady and was a great nanny. Kids love her, we love her and yeah so we've kept her around even though my wife became a stay at home after our youngest's birth. \n\nEarlier this week I got home and Lila told me that she found my son (2) was playing with my watch and while trying to take it from him he threw it across the room and it broke. I wasn't too happy about that since it was a sentimental, and quite expensive gift, from a late father figure but I clearly remember myself leaving it on the coffee table while working in the living room so it was really my own fault and just charged it. Regardless I don't know why but I went through the footage from our living room camera and it showed Lila throwing the watch on the floor. This was very peculiar so I asked her again about the watch and how my son could've thrown it so hard and she just shrugged. My wife later confronted her with the footage and she confessed that she found my watch and wanted to put it somewhere safe but then she saw a spider on the floor, freaked out, and threw the watch in shock at the spider.\n\nSo I'm a very untrusting guy in general and trust is hard to come by with me. It's a toxic trait of mine but I can't help it. I think we interviewed Lila like 10 times including supervised trials before giving her the job. I'm sad about the watch but I've lost trust her in since she looked me in the eye twice and lied both times. It might be an overreaction but I fired her. It wasn't fun, a lot of tears, lot of words said and now I'm just thinking whether I was wrong in firing her.",

Tbh I in no way believe that tripe about the spider, although I'm baffled as to her actual motives. Maybe she's playing favourites with her charges, too?\n\n\nAnd from a purely child safety perspective? As a parent you simply DO NOT leave vulnerable kids with someone who will lie to you, both about your children and about their own actions with caring for the kids, especially not someone who is quite clearly setting up the foundations for requiring your children to share secrets with them. I don't care who the person is, none of that is ok for a caregiver to pull.",

Or it could serve as the foundations of emotional blackmail wherein dangerous shite like \"our little secret\" can bloom, to cover up any future mishaps or deliberate bad actions from the nanny.",

Perhaps she simply wanted to get one of the kids in trouble, or get attention from the parents or something along those lines.\n\nIt's not reasonable that if you see a spider crawling along the floor that you could kill it by throwing an expensive wristwatch at. The chances are a billion to 1 that you could kills a spider that way. Again, the nanny could have just walked or run away, or gotten something that would have more effectively killed the spider or vacuumed it up.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy wife and I have 3 kids, the eldest is 7 and since her birth we've had 'Lila' as our stay in nanny to help out. She's a nice lady and was a great nanny. Kids love her, we love her and yeah so we've kept her around even though my wife became a stay at home after our youngest's birth. \n\nEarlier this week I got home and Lila told me that she found my son (2) was playing with my watch and while trying to take it from him he threw it across the room and it broke. I wasn't too happy about that since it was a sentimental, and quite expensive gift, from a late father figure but I clearly remember myself leaving it on the coffee table while working in the living room so it was really my own fault and just charged it. Regardless I don't know why but I went through the footage from our living room camera and it showed Lila throwing the watch on the floor. This was very peculiar so I asked her again about the watch and how my son could've thrown it so hard and she just shrugged. My wife later confronted her with the footage and she confessed that she found my watch and wanted to put it somewhere safe but then she saw a spider on the floor, freaked out, and threw the watch in shock at the spider.\n\nSo I'm a very untrusting guy in general and trust is hard to come by with me. It's a toxic trait of mine but I can't help it. I think we interviewed Lila like 10 times including supervised trials before giving her the job. I'm sad about the watch but I've lost trust her in since she looked me in the eye twice and lied both times. It might be an overreaction but I fired her. It wasn't fun, a lot of tears, lot of words said and now I'm just thinking whether I was wrong in firing her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A lot of people here are assuming malice, but it's more easily explained by simple fear and embarrassment. Depending on her financial circumstances it could've been a very difficult situation for her. Obviously lying wasn't the way to deal with it and you had to fire her because, as you say, someone who will lie to your face repeatedly cannot be trusted around your children. But she may well have been really scared about how you'd react, the implications for her life of losing the job and having to pay for the watch - many people do not have the luxury of being able to take a financial knock like that.  And blaming it on a small child who no one would ever hold any anger or malice towards could've seemed like the best option. It wasn't, but I don't like the automatic assumptions here that this person is jealous and spiteful or has some nefarious motive. People do stupid things when they're scared.",

Examples being stealing from me, breaking something I lent out, and then lying about the circumstance to me when confronted about it. \n\nNothing wrong with what you did, it's the principle of the matter.",

My paranoid ass says this wasn't about a spider or jealous rage, my thinking is it was a test run, you break something and pin it on the kid, if believed and never confronted you slowly escalate pinning other things on them every so often until you can start benefitting from it.

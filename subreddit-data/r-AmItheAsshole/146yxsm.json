Ok, the crusts don\u2019t get eaten when you order pizza - get thin crust or NY style to maximize the non-crust surface area or just assume the crust isn\u2019t going to get eaten if you choose to order pizza. What else is really being wasted? Is she serving herself lots and then not eating it? Some people just grew up not being careful about food. It may seem silly, but this could be a sign that you arent compatible if neither of you are willing to compromise.",

If your girlfriend has a slice of pizza that is hers, regardless of who paid for it, that\u2019s her pizza. If she wants to eat the cheesy part and shove the rest up her nose, that\u2019s her prerogative. Stop making an issue over freaking pizza crust.",

We do not live together so a lot of times when we do get to see each other we either go out/order food. I also grew up in a home where we try our best to not waste food. For example, we wrap up any leftovers from every meal no matter how small. One pancake after breakfast? Into the fridge. Half-eaten burger? Into the fridge. Within the next couple days, the leftovers will be eaten by someone. And if no one eats it, then we will usually put it in the freezer to be eaten at a later date.\n\nOne of the foods we order, of course, is pizza. When I order pizza with my girlfriend, she usually tells me which pieces she wants and which ones I can have. I actually really like this because then I don\u2019t have to worry about upsetting anyone by eating a piece they really wanted. She claims that the crust is her favorite part of the pizza, so she saves it all for last. By that I mean she will eat the cheesy part of the pizza and leave the crust until she has eaten every slice she wanted and just has a plate of crust. The first time she did that I tried to eat her crust and she stopped me and told me that she saves it all for last because she likes it so much. The only thing is that she by the time she finishes all the cheesy parts, she is too full to eat her crust but still won\u2019t let me eat her crust. After we are done, I usually clean the table up and I will put the crust in a ziplock bag and put it in the fridge and eventually in the freezer if it\u2019s been a couple days. As much as I love pizza, I do not like the taste of day-old crust, especially when it becomes chewy from the microwave (I know there are ways to heat it up other than the microwave but I\u2019m too lazy and impatient to do that). Since I don\u2019t eat the leftover crust, it is up to her to eat it and I always tell her that the crust is either in the fridge or in the freezer for when she wants it.\n\nAbout a month ago we got into a bit of a fight about how much money and food we waste when we are together. Since I buy most of the food, I don\u2019t like to waste it because it feels like I am wasting money. She said she understood but then a week later when we saw each other, we ended up wasting just as much food. That really upset me so the next day I decided to take all of her crust that had been in the freezer, heat it up, and put it on a plate for her to eat. I\u2019m not entirely sure how old the crust was, but let\u2019s just say I don\u2019t remember the last time I cleaned out the freezer. When she saw what I did she got really angry, told me she was breaking up with me, and left. She didn\u2019t speak to me for a couple of days until she realized she left some of her stuff here and needed to get it back. When she came by, she wouldn\u2019t look or listen to me when I gave her the stuff. I know it was rude, but I still feel like she is overreacting a little bit.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

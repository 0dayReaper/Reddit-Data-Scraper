You also very well may need or want help. Flu season is absolutely valid and precautions can be taken. Bonding, meh, some visits here and there aren\u2019t going to effect that at all and can actually help. But this is assuming your family respects general boundaries like visiting hours or respecting parental choices by you etc.",

I know a lot of midwives and docs as friends and not one suggests that a baby needs to be isolated for two months unless baby or parent are immunocompromised. \n\nAnd new parents need lots of things but 2 months of isolation aren't generally it, unless one or both have social anxiety. \n\nSo while it's your baby and your call, you're throwing out weirdly incoherent reasons for it.

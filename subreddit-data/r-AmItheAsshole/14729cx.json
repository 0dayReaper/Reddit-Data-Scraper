Please view our [voting guide here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what.2019s_with_these_acronyms.3F_what_do_they_mean.3F), and remember to use **only one** judgement in your comment.\n\nOP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:\n\n &gt; 1. I posted videos of my niece and nephew misbehaving to explain why I did not want them at my birthday dinner.\n2. My parents have told me that posting those videos accomplished nothing besides embarrassing my sister. And that I was being a bad family member by not trying to make compromises for my birthday dinner (such as not allowing anyone under 18, so my niece and nephew wouldn't feel excluded.)\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I raised my daughter in what I called \u201chands off\u201d but it meant not always intervening if there wasn\u2019t a real issue? Like, not running to her if she fell if she obviously wasn\u2019t hurt, letting her choose her own (weather appropriate) attire even if that meant taking Tinkerbell in combat boots to the store, allowing her the chance to solve problems without my intervention at first. But if she started misbehaving I was there in an instant. She was mine to raise, no one else\u2019s. \n\nShe got to make her own choices as long as those choices didn\u2019t negatively impact people around us. It let her build her own confidence in her choices and learn about the world through her own means and not with the same lens I have. It did not mean do whatever the fuck you want whenever you want to.",

Hell, I know when she lost her virginity. She tells me everything because while I might not approve, she knows I\u2019m not going to scream at her. She knows if shit goes down, she can always call me and I will pick her up, no questions asked. Teens do shit. Approval or not. I\u2019d rather know about it to keep her as safe as I can. Forbidding the behavior would make her secretive. Forbidding independence makes it harder for them to thrive on their own as an adult.

They in no way loved that I would go to parties and drink as a teen, but the fact that they didn\u2019t try to stop me (which lets be real, causes kids to rebel even more) and let me make my own life decisions made me feel like I was respected.

Some even decide that they need to step in as parents (the ones who see my kids once every few months for two hours, and are too busy playing sport today to see their grandkid for his birthday - yes I'm a wee bit salty about that - a lot - fuck them).",

Unfortunately it often just messes kids up as it comes from a place of caring more about what society and others think of you and your children and worrying about not disrupting other people, as opposed to caring more about how your child forms an understanding of the world around them and develops in mentally healthy ways regardless of whether that may inconvenience someone else or yourself in the short term.",

She decided that she was going to break the cycle and not abuse her kids, which she succeeded in doing, but she still accidentally passed down some harmful things. She was very hover-y, not wanting to let us get anywhere in the same zip code as danger (the opposite of her parents who couldn't give one shit), she never made us clean or do chores (the opposite of her parents who made her do all the cleaning and assigned chores as a punishment), etc. She swung really hard the other way, which is better than what she got, but the outcome is that I was and continue to be infantilized by her despite the fact that I'm nearly 30, and I never learned how to organize my house because I never had to do it. I learned to do dishes, laundry, other things like that as an adult teenager, but the prospect of organizing makes me collapse onto the floor and cry, I'm not exaggerating. \n\nSomeone might say she's a bad mom for not giving us age appropriate cleaning responsibilities, or for letting us \"fuck around and find out\" when it wasn't such a big deal. But I know my mom agonized over every decision and she has such a loving, empathetic personality. She always tried to put her kids before herself and even though she made some mistakes, I still think overall she did a good job. Parenting is really fucking rough and that's why I decided I'm not gonna have kids (one of the reasons). Like fuck man, kids develop their attachment style before age 2? Shit you do mindlessly that they won't remember impacts their whole damn attachment style? It's so much pressure. Everything you do impacts their development, psyche, and health. \n\nAll this to say I really felt your comment as someone whose mom tried so hard and did honestly a better than average job, but who still made some noticeable mistakes.",

I love them, I just need to emotionally prepare before I see them sometimes, and sometimes I am simply not mentally up for it at all. One of them kept hitting me the last time I saw them and their parent (my sibling) not only did nothing, but told me to just put up with it. I could've cried in frustration. I've been doing my best to avoid them since that incident.\n\nNot only is it awful for other people to be around these kids, but it's not setting these kids up for their future. They've not been taught to be considerate and things like that, and that's going to be tough for them in the long run.\n\nI am curious whether your other family sees the problem as well? Mine does, but nobody wants to be the person to say something. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I would, but I know my sibling will do exactly what yours did, OP, only I don't have any video evidence.",

As a result they either play the victim or they try to puff themselves up and act like they are better than everybody else.\n\nWhen OP told the sister that she doesn't control her kids, that caused her a narcissistic injury.  The fact that it was true was not a factor.  For narcissists \"truth\" is a function of whether something validates them, their feelings literally do not care about facts. So she sought out validation to salve that wound and went public with her victim act.\n\nBTW, her narcissism is probably why she won't discipline her kids either.  Kids don't like to be disciplined and she's probably too insecure to cope with their reactions if she were to try.  Narcissists are really quite pathetic, they would even be sympathetic if they weren't so hurtful to the people around them.",

Being an adult, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to not want unruly children at your adult birthday party. It\u2019s your birthday which is supposed to be celebrating you, and you shouldn\u2019t have had to worry about dealing with the children or them causing other issues.\n\nIt was out of line for her to post that. She brought down a world of garbage upon you, leading up to what should\u2019ve been a special once a year event, and actively tried to ruin it for you by doing so\u2014not to mention she lied and twisted the truth to start this drama. The moment she put it out there for the world to see you were _perfectly_ within your rights to defend yourself from slander and subsequent attacks. Doing nothing would have only tarnished your character and reputation further. \n\nYou\u2019re also correct that your parents \u201csolution\u201d would not have been fair to you or Megan. Not to mention the only one making Parker and Sofia actually feel excluded was their own mother.\n\nEdit to add: you should add the fact one of the videos was posted _by_ Angel already, and you simply gave the link for it, to your post. A lot of people are commenting without seeing that and judging you for sharing what was already out there.",

Your sister fired the first shot with her snarky post so you were well within limits to post back up. If she wants to be a neglectful parent and create two monsters who don\u2019t know how to behave it\u2019s on her. She\u2019s not helping them. As for the rest of the family, too bad. I hope your party was fantastic.",

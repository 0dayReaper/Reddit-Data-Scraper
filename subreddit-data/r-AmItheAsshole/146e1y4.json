    "postText": "So I live in a condo and the surrounding buildings put flowers on their shared front stoops last month. There are some pots outside my building that remained empty all last season and were again empty this season. Today I went to the local farm and purchased flowers to put in them to make the front of our building look nice like the others. I did errands and came home to a note by the front door saying \u201cfor future reference: the flower pots belong to unit *** and are not community property.\u201d I immediately replanted my flowers into smaller pots I had lying around (now there are like 10 small pots on the front stoop and I plan to give some away because it looks ridiculous) and left a note back saying the following: \u201cI am so sorry! I did not realize! I re potted the plants and put fresh soil in your pots for you. I bought the coco liner for the hanging basket- feel free to put it to good use! Happy Spring!\u201d I just wanted the front to look nice and didn\u2019t think anyone would have an issue, especially since the planters went unused last season and were again unused this season. AITA and should I have tried to figure out who\u2019s pots they were prior to planting?",

Your actions thereafter were nice. \n\nI see no conflict here and in fact, I wish more people in our world related to each other with such politeness and courtesy.",

I'd find out whether there is a policy on having empty pots outside all year round, some associations have rules about that sort of thing. You have nothing to apologize for, they sound like a scrooge.",

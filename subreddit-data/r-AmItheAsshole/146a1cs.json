    "postText": "I (22) am a university student who was kind of struggling with stressed from switching from COVID classes back to regular classes about a year ago. Nothing serious, but my stress can sometimes manifest as me looking and acting depressed, when I\u2019m actually just tired.\n\nQuite recently, my high school teacher passed away. I just so happened to be in town in time for the funeral, so I went. I\u2019m not on facebook or instagram or twitter, so my mom had to tell me of his passing. I\u2019m autistic and not great with socializing with people and maintaining relationships, so she often tells me anything that goes on in my old high school. I\u2019m not particularly interested most of the time and just gossip with her to socialize, but since she tells me stuff I tend to not check up on my school\u2019s instagram page and stuff. \n\nThe high school I went to was small. My graduating class was only 17 kids. I wouldn\u2019t say that I was close friends with all of them, but we were definitely friends. I unfortunately had a hard time maintaining those friendships after high school due to my lack of presence on social media, so they somewhat deteriorated.\n\nThe funeral was nice. I saw people I knew before the ceremony begun and we were all catching up and sharing stories about our teacher. Then someone asked why I couldn\u2019t make it to Cody\u2019s funeral. (Not his real name).\n\nI felt like I swallowed an ice cube. \u201cCody\u2019s dead?!\u201d\n\nCody was a classmate who I graduated with. We had worked on several school projects together. For christmas one year, he got me a model of a Mercury rocket, my favorite american rocket. He was a bit mean sometimes, but I know he meant well. \n\nHe died a year ago. \n\nI, obviously, didn\u2019t know that he had passed away. I had to find out at another funeral for my teacher. In a way, it felt like I lost both of them at the same time. When I cried during the funeral ceremony, I didn\u2019t know if it was for my teacher or my friend.\n\nWhen I got home, I told my mom what had happened to Cody. Not to get into details, but his death was particularly tragic due to his young age. She said that she knew, and that she had deliberately refused to tell me because she felt that my mental health at the time was bad. I said \u201cWho are you to dictate when I mourn!\u201d. It turned into an argument. \n\nMy dad texted me a few hours ago and told me not to be angry with my mom, because she was trying to protect me. I said that if she wanted to protect me, she could have told me way sooner! I feel embarrassed that I looked like an ass in front of my high school friends and old teachers, and angry that my mom didn\u2019t tell me that he died. \n\nI understand why she didn\u2019t tell me, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to agree with it. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: Okay everyone, I understand now! I unintentionally had my mom pushed into the roll of keeper when it was my duty to maintain friendships, no matter how difficult it was. Thanks everyone!",

How is she to know what you can cope with, when she can see you struggle but you don\u2019t voice it, she can only take a guess\n\nYou said you present as depressed when you\u2019re tired - how can your mum know this - especially when she wasn\u2019t seeing you in person? \n\nThat\u2019s a lot  to put on one person. I don\u2019t agree that she didn\u2019t tell you - but in all honesty it shouldn\u2019t have been left to her to have to break it to you.",

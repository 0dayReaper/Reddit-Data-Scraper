Many people have the misconception that their level of grief equates to how much the deceased was loved.

Anna needs to give herself permission to live, while still acknowledging she misses her Mom.",

Sometimes they never are again. \n\nWhen I lost my husband, I couldn't see anything but my grief, except the anger I felt over the loss too. Having gone through that, I can accept that some selfishness and drama may be par for the course for awhile, maybe a long while. Now, the but..... BUT just because you can't contain yourself, doesn't mean other people have to deal with you. That's one of the things that makes extreme grief so isolating. Besides missing your dearest person, you are in such a state, that even mental health professionals have to clock out and tag someone else in.\n\nShe should have dropped out, or at the very, very least left when asked. I was told I was being an AH the day before the funeral, and while I still have a whole bunch of opinions about how I think it was absurd to have expected better of me, I walked away and called for a ride. You can't make other people understand your grief. And it's ok if you still need to wallow in your feelings, but it's just as ok for people not to be able to wallow with you. Like I said, grief is lonely.",

What surprised me is my own reaction. My parents were older so I'd seen all my grandparents pass, some uncles, a few cousins, and my mom had passed several years before. I never thought I would be the person who feel like grief broke them inside.\n\nI'd guess that her bridesmaid felt anger and jealousy and turned it back on the bride. And those feelings are ok, but if you don't examine deeper and see it for what it really is, things like this happen. And it's hard to accept when we feel those feelings. But it can hurt to have someone's happiness remind you of your pain. It can make you angry at everything. Especially when it rocks you out of a brief period of feeling some recovery.\n\nMaybe the bride can talk to her bridesmaid about how much she must hurt. Chalk up the whole dress thing and outburst to nothing more than evidence of the depth of agonizing grief. Or her friend is sadly immature. But no reason not to take the high road.\n\nYou're a good egg, u/IAmForeverKiki.",

They buried her only a few days before the wedding. He considered postponing the wedding, but in the end decided to go ahead. He wept during part of the service. So did his father. So did many of the relatives.

Ive lost a parent and know how devastating that it. It sounds like she could benefit from some therapy.\n\nCongrats on your marriage",

Anna knew and disregarded what she had repeatedly been told.  She showed her grief for attention was more important to her than the joy she should have felt for her friend's special occasion.  Anna needs therapy to which she can wear any color she desires.  \n\n\nI'll bet a dollar to a donut that Anna didn't choose a soft bluish purple but something bold and bright purple which looked entirely out of place for carefully color-coordinated photos the bride and groom desired.  She did that intentionally to be the center of attention.  If her bold purple were OK'd, I feel sure she would have done something else to put the focus on herself -- like starting a speech at the dinner \"This year I lost my mother and it has been the most challenging struggle in my life.  I wore purple today in her memory.  She was the best mother ever and my best friend.  Thank you for recognizing my loss.   Oh and congratulations to bride and groom who haven't really suffered any big losses so are celebrating today.\"",

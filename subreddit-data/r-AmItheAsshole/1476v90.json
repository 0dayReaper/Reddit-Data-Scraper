On the other hand it might be that she just was overheard.\n\nAnd \"You didn't want to be here so I'm coming to drag you here\" is massive entitlement and incredibly toxic behaviour.",

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI\u2019ll try to keep this as concise as possible and I apologize for any formatting issues, as I\u2019m on mobile. \n\nSome context: birthday\u2019s are a big deal for my wife and her sisters due to some stuff that happened when they were kids that I won\u2019t go into here. Since I\u2019ve been a part of things, the general expectation is that we all do whatever the birthday girl wants to do and give them a fun day. It\u2019s a pretty good system that has caused very few issues. \n\nNow to the issue at hand. Today is my SIL\u2019s (we\u2019ll call her Beth) birthday. She had gone out with my wife, their younger sister and Beth\u2019s best friend last night (I was supposed to go as well but had to bail last minute because I had been getting sick all day) so she wanted today to be pretty low-key. She called my wife this morning and told her that she wanted to go to the thrift store and then come back to our place where my wife would then make dinner. I stayed home with my kids because I had already told my wife that I didn\u2019t want to leave the house today. While they were out, my wife sent me a picture of herself eating a sandwich and I had jokingly asked if she got me one, to which she responded \u201cyou aren\u2019t here babe.\u201d I replied (again, as a joke) that I wasn\u2019t invited. My wife immediately called me and said \u201cSo you didn\u2019t want to hang out with us and go to the thrift store but you would\u2019ve come to get a sandwich?\u201d I said yes as a joke but it was very clear right away that it did not come across that way to her and Beth. It got pretty awkward at that point so I said we could talk about it later and hung up. Right after I got off the phone, Beth texted me and said that she was coming to get me. I asked her not to because I wasn\u2019t in a very good mood and I would just be a buzzkill. She said that was too bad because she was coming anyway. This is the point that I started to get upset. I sent my wife a text asking her to please stop her sister from coming to get me and it devolved into an argument with my wife saying that I was throwing a fit and hurting Beth\u2019s feelings by making it all about me. My point of view is that none of this would\u2019ve happened had she not involved Beth in our private conversation in the first place (especially considering the point that we\u2019ve made it a rule between us that we never involve anyone else in our disagreements or fights) and she\u2019s now putting me in the uncomfortable position of her sister thinking that I was just throwing a fit and being an asshole for no reason. \n\nI sent Beth one final text apologizing because it her birthday and I didn\u2019t want to ruin it over a fight between me and my wife and now she\u2019s not talking to me. \n\nGive it to me straight, Reddit. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

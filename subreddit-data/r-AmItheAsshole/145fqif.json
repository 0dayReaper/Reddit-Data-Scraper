I'm 20 now. Ant tbh? It's better not to have any relationship, than to have a toxic or a forced one. I understand that your mom wants you to talk to him, as he's (only biologically) part of your life. But it's not your obligation to talk to him. If he never acted like a father to you, why should you act like a daughter to him? You don't owe him anything. As I've put up from your post, you have an amazing step father that loves you and you love him. And he acts more like a father to you than your bio father does. (Might've taken it wrong tho, I can't see deeper in your relationship.)\nBut if Its like I think it is, maybe tell her that you already have your father (stepdad) and since he's stepped up more than your bio dad has, you accept HIM. No need to have two fathers since only one is acting like a real one.\nIf he wanted to, he would.\nMaybe forgive them for your inner peace, so you won't be holding a grudge over this, but that doesn't mean you have to keep in touch.\nSending love\u2764\ufe0f\n(Sorry for any mistakes, english is not my first language)",

You probably have teachers or parents of friends who give a bigger shit about you than your entire paternal family branch.

I\u2019m 31 now, and, thanks to my husband putting in a lot of work to help me, I just recently had the confidence to tell him *exactly* why our relationship is so awful (he\u2019s a controlling, manipulative narcissist who wants things only his way, and if there\u2019s anything other than that, it\u2019s not good enough for him). All of the problems I had/have are because of my screwed up parents, including my stepdad, but that\u2019s another point entirely. The point is, from the time where my dad no longer had full control over me, our relationship has been ruined. It\u2019s very toxic, and I have spent years crying and wondering what I did wrong. I\u2019m telling you, you do not need toxic people in your life. I wish I had come to the conclusion you did when I was a lot younger. My mom, too, encouraged me to continue talking to him, because \u201che\u2019s my dad\u201d. That means nothing when you\u2019re treated so poorly, and you get hurt. I commend you for not taking it. It\u2019s not always  easy to cut people from your life, but, unfortunately, it\u2019s for the best sometimes.",

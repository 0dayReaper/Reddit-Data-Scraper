    "postText": "I'm a software engineer, with a full time job and a side hustle of doing freelance coding work in my own time. I've always been the type to have a side hustle I put a lot of my free time into; I get really bored sitting idle.\n\nMy freelance hourly rates are $60 an hour, and at my full time job, my hourly pay works out to about $40 an hour. So that's how I value my time. \n\nAnyway, over Christmas vacation, I was staying at my parents house. My cousin was also staying over with her three young kids from Christmas to new year's.\n\nI'd been planning on doing some work on my freelance projects when I had free time; in the mornings when my family had no plans. I wasn't in any rush; I was already ahead of schedule on them all, but I didn't really have anything else to do. It was in a really rural area and it's like an hour drive to the nearest anything\n\nThen my cousin and her husband asked if I could babysit all day for three days, so they could visit some friends in the area and hang out with just adults. I said I had planned on doing freelance work at the library, and she offered to pay me to babysit.\n\nI said I could if they got close to my freelance rates. She wanted a number, and although my freelance rates are $60 I didn't feel like that was right, it was high. But I didn't want to go too low; honestly babysitting 3 kids would be harder for me than the routine coding work I had for my freelance project. I don't know a lot about kids and I've never babysat for long, and I had a feeling it would be stressful and difficult.\n\nSo I said $35, which is below what I make hourly at work, and what is the bare minimum I'd value my time for, if that time is spent doing difficult work. \n\nAnd she went crazy at me, saying that's a ridiculous rate for babysitting, that I was entitled and being selfish, that I'm trying to take advantage of how she didn't have other options, etc.\n\nI said that's way below what I'd be making if I had the time to do my own work, and I'd be putting off my own work to babysit. \n\nHer husband then got mad at me saying that I was a 24 year old girl, that I'm damn near a child myself, that my time is not worth that much and it's childish to say that it was. And that I was a stupid girl for not knowing that babysitting costs like 15 an hour, when I grew up and have kids of my own I will see how stupid I was being.\n\nI was kind of done with being called stupid so I just told them I hoped they could find someone else.\n\nMy mom thinks that I asked for something offensive, and my cousin and her husband obviously did too.\n\nAITA for giving that number?",

He was a completely ridiculous toddler (turned out to have ADHD, surprising absolutely nobody.) \n\nI was determined not to have an only child, so I had #2. SHE WAS A TRICK BABY. She didn't even like being held. She listened to instructions before she could even walk. Then I got cocky and had #3. She didn't sleep for about 15 months. And that's why the longest gap is between #3 &amp; #4. Took me that long to psych myself up again.\n\nBut #4 has been easy.

To sign up with the nannying agency I worked for I had to be certified in things like CPR and I worked M-F. Some Nannies are six days a week and live in with the family. \n\nI was in college and was a fill in Nanny for this family so I could still attend classes. Their normal Nanny was getting married and they gave her a whole summer off (Nicest family). I filled in while I was out of school for the summer and then on occasion as a regular babysitter during the year with the normal nanny needed time off. \n\nBut being a Nanny is more intensive than just babysitting. I cooked meals for him that were discussed with his parents, scheduled activities out of the home, took them to appointments and for this kid,  also helped him learn his French vocabulary too. \n\n\nI should also add for OP, over the summer my friend asked me to last minute babysit for her because her daughter wasn't feeling great and she couldn't get a last minute sitter through her agency (it was a 60 dollar fee!) I babysat her for 6 hours as a favor and yet she *still* insisted on paying the going rate for her usual sitter (25$/hr for one kid) despite me telling her she didn't need to.",

In the UK, a nanny is a professional with (likely) a background check and some training who looks after the kids 8am-6pm (or similar) and takes proper care of them, whereas a babysitter is next door's 15yr old who comes by at 7pm to watch TV with the kids before bedtime when mum and dad go out for dinner.",

In my city, $15-20 an hour is fairly standard but it's also common to add an extra $5+ an hour per sibling for multiple children.\n\nHowever, I don't think OP was being unreasonable given the circumstances. I babysit because I enjoy children and I take it very seriously. Children get my full attention, I never turn on the TV unless the parent directs me to and I plan special crafts, games, story times and activities for them (I also provide all the supplies). \n\nBut I am VERY picky about what families and children I will work with. I am not shy about politely turning families down if I don't think it's a good fit or their children are out of control. A babysitter is an invaluable resource for parents, not a servant position for which the young female should be grateful to receive. Babysitters are the people who are being trusted completely ALONE with care of your children. \n\n The attitude that babysitting is a menial, simple job for silly, young and unintelligent girls and young women is offensive and stupid. Honestly, as parents now, my husband and I still won't leave our child with anyone other than grandparents, aunts and uncles (and they are the ones begging us to let them babysit). But when we do eventually hire a babysitter, you better believe we will hire someone who actually considers themselves a babysitter, who takes as much pride and pleasure in it as I do and they will be compensated and respected accordingly whether they are 19 or 39. We would also NEVER attempt to pressure or guilt anyone into watching our child for us. \n\nOP has a job and a side job she takes very seriously and, clearly, it pays very well. She should not be forced to turn down work for a side job because relatives want cheap childcare. If they need childcare, they need to hire an actual babysitter, not attempt to force OP to become a babysitter for them. Being female does not make you an automatic babysitter (just as being male doesn't disqualify you from being an excellent babysitter). OP is clearly not a babysitter and her time is worth more than $15 an hour in this situation.",

I'm a photographer and get the people who say I'm only pressing a button, so I just want to be educated on what makes babysitting so valuable (why aren't you only pressing a button).",

We decided to both continue to work full time and see how it goes, as neither has interest in being a stay at home parent.  The facility we got into accepts infants starting at 8 weeks, and neither of us have built in parental leave (yay america, land of the \"fuck you poor people). We have a down payment in at the place and I will take a few days off work and then boom back to the grind. \n\nBleghhhh i am scared but so excited.",

The problem with OP and everyone in this thread is they're treating it like a business transaction when it's just a family member asking for a favor (too big of a favor imo). Also would there have still been no quiet time to work on projects while watching the kids? Is she going to be full on working for three days straight?\n\nI agree with you, it should have been a yes or no.\n\nEdit: Since I'm getting the most replies to this comment and people arent really reading my replies to other people I'm just going to add a few points here\n\n1. I'm not defending the parent's reaction afterwards, it was entirely uncalled for,\n2. Even asking for 3 days of babysitting is an asshole move on their part unless there's more context we're missing,\n3. It's disingenuous to conflate \"watching over your nieces and nephews in the house you're already staying\" with \"professional babysitting complete strangers in a strange house\" when it comes to rates, but I consider that issue moot because,\n4. If she didn't want to take care of the kids she should have just said no and stuck to it. Instead she's either trying make a profit off the engagement by pricing the interaction as if it were her job and they were just clients, or she's passive-aggressively telling them no by subtly telling them how much she makes in her off-time and quoting them a number they knew they couldn't afford. I've said this to multiple other people in thread, you either want to spend time with your family or you don't. ITS FINE if you don't, but telling someone \"you're going to have to pay me to spend time with them like it were my job\" is an AH thing to say.\n\nI honestly don't know how genuine the parents were with their request, some people here seem to think they're evil masterminds who were plotting to swindle and manipulate OP from the start. That MAY be true, however it's always important to understand we're only hearing one, very biased, side of the story",

            "comment": "YTA and here\u2019s why.\n\nYou either do it or you don\u2019t. Balance isn\u2019t always the best option. \n\nCommit to your freelance projects and tell your cousin you\u2019re sorry but you had budgeted the time to get these done and you\u2019d just be stressed out otherwise. \n\nOr commit to babysitting and helping out your family, spending time with your little kid cousins. Don\u2019t charge them and enjoy. Tell your clients the end of year holidays is the only time you really disconnect and spend with family. Almost everyone gets that.\n\nEither one of those options would have been decisive and worked. But the wishy washy middle ground is problematic. \n\nIt\u2019s similar to money. You should never loan to friends and family expect to get paid back. You\u2019ll almost always be disappointed. So you give the money as a gift, or you refuse.\n\nEdit: Just want to add, it\u2019s a soft \u201cYTA.\u201d The request from the cousins is excessive. I don\u2019t think you had to say yes or anything. Just pick yes or no.\n\nEdit 2: Wanted to clarify: I don\u2019t think accepting any compensation is a negative thing. Just that calculating how much you want for babysitting your cousins during a family holiday by how much you earn as a freelance coder is, in my opinion, not the best way to calculate. My feeling is you simplify by focusing on work or enjoying the time with your kid cousins. Either way works. \n\nAlso, based on OP\u2019s other comments: the cousins planned to be gone in the afternoons and evenings but would be home every night. I\u2019d assume they\u2019d be there each morning, too, which changes the situation a bit. And they were all staying at OP\u2019s parents\u2019 house. Because OP said she planned on spending most days with her family, I also assume her parents would be around most of the day, too. That also changes the situation a bit. I\u2019m not saying she needed to babysit or that the request is somehow very reasonable. Just that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as egregious a situation as others have made it out to be in there responses to me.\n\nEdit 3: A lot of people have had no issues with OP using her hourly coding rate for babysitting. I\u2019d counter with imagining other situations like that and if they make sense to you.\n\nFor example, we\u2019ve all worked some lame ass hourly job at some point (probably, hopefully). If you\u2019re making $10 an hour at Subway, should that be how everyone else values your time? Should you be willing to help move a friend\u2019s piano for $10 an hour? Or drive a family member to a city 3 hours away for $10 an hour? Or babysit your cousin\u2019s kids for $10?\n\nLikewise, imagine your best friend was a lawyer who charges $250 per hour. What if you asked your friend to walk your dog a couple days while you\u2019re out of town and they said they\u2019d do it for $250 per hour? That would be absurd, right?",

OP gave her a price, which was frankly reasonable for 3 kids.  They didn't like the cost, and instead of just saying \"thats too much, thanks anyway\", they proceeded to belittle her.  Nothing about OP seemed wishy washy.  She said \"This is how much I'd need to do this for you\".  That is pretty straight.\n\nNow, here is where I'm not sure if I'm correct.  I'm a guy, so that is probably why I've never been asked to babysit.  However, they should'nt have offered money if they weren't willing to pay it.

And that I was a stupid girl for not knowing that babysitting costs like 15 an hour\n\nThat is a really offensive and ignorant statement to someone who is doing their own freelance IT projects.\n\n&gt;I said that's way below what I'd be making if I had the time to do my own work, and I'd be putting off my own work to babysit.\n\nYour time is worth what it is worth. Supply &amp; demand; their demand is high, and supply of babysitters is low - therefore they can get fucked and pay you $35/hr. If they want you to use your time babysitting instead of coding, then they should be paying a premium for it.",

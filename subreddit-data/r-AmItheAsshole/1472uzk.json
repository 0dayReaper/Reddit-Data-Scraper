    "postText": "I had booked a long term accommodation on the site Spotahome and on the day of moving accommodation the landlord sends me an additional surprise contract on whatsapp. (Spotahome allows another contract between tenants and landlords which supersedes the contract from the website, but it still caught me off guard as he hadn't mentioned it before; I'm used to airbnb etc). I am reading through the terms while I'm travelling and they seem rather bluntly and broadly giving himself a ton of rights (and some which he already has on the spotahome contract). This includes the ability for the host to keep \"anything\" from the deposit, and the fact that the guest explicitly exonerates all direct and indirect damages incurred. \n\nI was a bit confused by the language used (maybe this stuff is normal? tell me in comments), so I asked on whatsapp about what one of them means. Namely if the exoneration is about personal or property damages (apparently it's personal injury (??)). Suddenly he got really offended that I was asking him about the terms. He was saying \"why does that matter\", and \"where is this behaviour coming from\", \"don't play games with me\", etc. I told him this is just a minor thing, not really a big deal and I'll sign it anyway. I didn't even ask him to amend any terms. I said this will be water under the bridge soon but he said no: \"You know what, I don't like you\" and \"contact spotahome to get your money back and find another place, enjoy your stay in \\[city\\].\" Then suddenly I was homeless for half a day until I eventually sorted something out (had to lug my luggage around everywhere now because he didn't let me check in).\n\nI have three theories. One is that perhaps he had some litigious guest in the past debate him about security deposits etc. and now he's not taking any chances. Or maybe he is trying to strongarm my rights away from me by not letting him question this surprise contract (shady business). Or maybe I'm TA by not understanding basic business norms of standard contracts and acting like I don't trust him (tell me in comments if this is true).",

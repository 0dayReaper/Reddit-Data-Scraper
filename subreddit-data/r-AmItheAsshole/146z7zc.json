    "postText": "So I am currently renting a room from my sister, paying the market rate in rent. There is no dishwasher, everything has to be washed up by hand and I realised a few days after moving here that she uses the same scrubbing sponge to clean the dog and cat bowl and then uses them on our dishes, etc. \n\nWe share all of the chores and I wash up too but I didn't realise the sponge is a shared one. I have raised this as a hygiene issue as dogs and cats lick their bottoms and then their food dishes and so I don't want the bacteria on the sponge that is then used to wash our things. \n\nShe gets angry and insulted when I have suggested this and makes out as if I'm gaslighting her and making her out to be crazy. She thinks there's absolutely nothing wrong with this. Am I the arsehole in this situation or is this as disgusting as I think it is?",

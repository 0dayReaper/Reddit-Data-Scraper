It happened with the entire  Jurassic World series except Dominion, because I finally gave up and watched that one on my own when she wasn\u2019t home,. It happened with multiple shows too, like The Office, Superstore, and Parks and Rec. It happened with Prehistoric Planet, where she started yelling about how the dinosaurs are sexist, and then she started ranting that it has \u201cno scientific evidence\u201d for how the dinosaurs looked and acted. I didn\u2019t say this, because she yells at me whenever I talk, but I was thinking the whole time that maybe if she would stop talking and listen to the show, she\u2019d know the scientific basis for how the dinosaurs looked and acted. When we tried to watch Chupa, she stopped it three minutes in and said it was \u201ctoo depressing.\u201d Most recently, it happened with the Tetris movie. I was trying to watch it with with her and my brother. After a few minutes of her talking nonstop already, my brother went downstairs to do something on his own. She then started yelling about how none of us ever want to watch shows with her (I wonder why). After about the twentieth time that I had to rewind the past few minutes because I couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying in the movie, I paused it. I was already mad at her, and I said that if she was going to talk the whole time and not watch the movie, she should do it somewhere else so I could actually *watch* it. She started yelling at me about how I was saying she \u201cwasn\u2019t even allowed to exist,\u201d so I told her that the whole point of watching a movie is to actually *see and hear* the movie. She started yelling about how rude I was, and told me I should just go to sleep. At 8:00 PM. This isn\u2019t the only annoying thing she does either. She constantly yells at me about how my brother does more than me around the house (meanwhile I\u2019m almost always the only one to take the dogs out, clean up *her* dog\u2019s piss and crap on the floor, clean the cat litter, and feed the dogs/cats, two of each.) She also makes me carry everything for her, and yells at me when I can\u2019t carry all of it at once. She\u2019ll be holding one or two things and start talking about how heavy it all is, while I stand there waiting for her to open the car/house door so I can put down the eight bags I\u2019m carrying.

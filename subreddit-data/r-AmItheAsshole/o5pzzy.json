I eat chicken feet and pig intestines all the time (highly recommend both, by the way) without really thinking much about it. If I ever mentioned that kind of stuff to non-Asians though, they'd say that Chinese food is disgusting. I once had a coworker decline getting a group lunch with us because she knew we were going to Chinatown and she \"didn't want to eat mystery meat.\" Years later I had a different coworker see me order pork belly (which isn't even that unordinary) and she asked why I was ordering dog food for lunch.\n\nThen when I went to Lyon (where the food feels more like a home cooked meal and is no where as pretentious as French food is often portrayed to be), so many restaurants there served foods with uncommon parts of animals and all the other tourists seemed amazed by it. I went into a bouchon one day and everyone there was ordering a sausage where the menu clearly stated was filled with nothing but pig intestines, and no one seemed grossed out at all. Even reading stuff online, they described it like it's okay to eat when it's a European prepping these kinds of food.",

Though I do think high temp cooking like many good Asian recipes does have a learning curve and equipment requirement that is much harder for many western people to replicate. Just like really good French food has a lot of precision or technique associated with it good Asian (no matter the country in Asia) has a skill set that is not replicable outside of the specific training associated with it. If she can\u2019t appreciate that skill she\u2019s not a very good chef. The big chefs might prefer their own backgrounds for cooking styles but most truly appreciate and incorporate a variety or techniques to get their desired outcome.",

But there IS a real racist/colonialist food bias for French food that is MESSED UP. Just look at the history of the Michelin star for a concrete example. \n\nCreating a dish for a fine dining experience of any sort is an ART and a SCIENCE that I personally could never be capable of.

I would be incredibly dumbfounded if Sarah could cook traditional Chinese food as well as OP, and equally so if he could cook haute French cuisine as well as her. That she actually sees one as being superior? She is a disgrace to chefs everywhere. Any chef knows food can be prepared a hundred different ways for a hundred different recipes, with a hundred different results, and none of which would be a waste to the food- none of them are wrong. \n\nI mean,  that she calls herself a chef, yet systematically decries OPs cultural expertise in the kitchen, is disgusting. And the fact that she compares herself to Ramsay, a chef who embodies learning all cooking techniques, from all over the world, is frankly embarrassing.\n\nI truly hope she is barred from her restaurant.",

Chinese cooking on the other hand, uses techniques and tools that aren't familiar to the typical western home cook (I'm thinking specifically of the wok. Yes, it's becoming more common in western households, but it's not one of those things that everyone in a western society owns.)",

Someone who talks like this to your face is a lot worse behind your back.\n\nThen there's the generalized racism of the entire notion that Asian food is crap and French is somehow elevated. Chinese cooking can require incredible skill and timing. There is literally nothing that French cuisine has that Asian cuisine doesn't, in terms of delicacy of the art, care taken with flavor and technique, or impressiveness of final product.\n\nAsian food is frequently inexpensive in the States because that's how our immigrating families *survived;* taking their recipes and making them sweeter and saltier because that's what white people wanted. But American Chinese food and traditional Chinese food aren't the same thing. And it's just filthily racist to insist that there's no such thing as good Chinese.\n\n(For non-Asian readers in the crowd, the documentary \"Searching for General Tso\" was pretty good.)\n\nYour wife is also TA, for telling you to apologize. She needs to grow a spine. What happens, when \"the fighting stops,\" if it means you've  had to compromise yourself? Does she realize what she's asking of you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nIn response to the edits:\n\n1. If Sarah gets fired for being a racist at work, guess what, the person she was racist at ain't the problem. OP's wife, who I assume will go through the comments, blaming the victim is not cool.\n2. Sarah's Cousin, that might'a been anthill kicking, a bit? Not sure what you intended to accomplish by it? Hopefully you're supporting OP, right?\n3. Doug, you need to fix your heart.\n4. OP's wife, good job clearing your head. Your husband is definitely not the asshole here, and it's not his responsibility to crawl before your sister's ego just so she'll stop being outwardly racist for a minute.\n\nEDIT AGAIN: if I had a dollar for every time one of George Takei's social media interns scraped one of my comments for his stupid website I'd have enough for pizza from one of those really upscale places. Do you hear me, Takei? You owe me a pizza!",

And like everyone else is saying, don\u2019t apologize; this is a pattern of behaviour on her part, not just some \u201charmless joke.\u201d \n\nShe has repeatedly and consistently undermined, belittled, criticized, and trivialized your mastery of your craft, and has specifically focused on the fact that you do some things differently than the way she does/was taught. She has never shown any interest in understanding how or why you do these things differently, or (from what I\u2019ve gathered,) shown respect for your skills or an appreciation for your cuisine/specialty. \n\nHer saying it was a joke *is* the joke in this situation; she clearly feels insecure or threatened by you being considered equal to her, and she\u2019s made it clear through her constant commentary that it\u2019s because she thinks your cuisine/culture is somehow inferior to hers/the one she specializes in. This is practically the definition of white supremacist ideology.\n\nNot only are you under no obligation to apologize to her, doing so will only further enable her behaviour. For your wife and family members who think you should apologize to her to \u201ckeep the peace,\u201d it is not possible for *you* to do that. You apologizing will *not* fix the problem, it will only make everyone else feel comfortable being complicit while your SIL continues to be subversively, even openly racist towards you in the family home.\n\nThe only person who can do anything close to \u201cfixing\u201d this situation is your SIL. It\u2019s her responsibility to own up to her behaviour, and genuinely apologize to you and make a personal commitment to improving herself and the way she views and treats you and other people/cultures. If she can\u2019t or won\u2019t be an adult and accept culpability for her actions, then that\u2019s unfortunate, and any tension or disunity that results from this situation is on her, not you. \n\nIf this conflict upsets others in the family, then they need to let her know that this is the case. They should also be ready to accept that she may not be willing to accept responsibility, and not expect you to come in and \u201csave the day.\u201d Racism causes harm in so many ways, and this experience of family division is one that they (as white people) can experience and appreciate. \n\nIf they want to fix the problem, should they expect the racist to apologize and change their behaviour, or expect the wronged party to simply tolerate experiencing racism from their own extended family? \n\nYou are being the bigger person by not giving in to the pressure to placate for the sake of \u201cthe family.\u201d It\u2019s not always the easy thing to do, but it\u2019s the right thing to do, even if it means this situation doesn\u2019t get resolved any time soon, or ever. I hope that your wife understands this and comes around/supports you with this moving forward, as it doesn\u2019t sound like your SIL is going to make this easy for anyone, which is really just a shame.",

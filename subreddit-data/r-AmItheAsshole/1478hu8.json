    "postText": "Basically this all happened a couple of hours ago and I\u2019m still shaking from this. I am ok mobile so i May format it wrong however I\u2019m an English major so excuse my colorful language.\n\n\nI was riding a train from where my (20f) boyfriend (21) lives back home. On the train at first I sat next to this lovely young lady and we talked for a bit before she got off an hour later. I get both seats to myself for an hour so I play slime rancher, which is my de-stresser (I love all of their little happy noises :) they\u2019re so cute.) I was happy, talking to the people across from me while playing, in which I should explain them.\n\n\nThey were these two people somehow from my town and offered to give me a ride because my original ride and I had a miscommunication. They were a little older than me and super cool people, very happy I sat by them. \n\n\nAnd this is when the new guy decides to roll onto the train. He was an older gentlemen, in his 80\u2019s and he seemed nice. He sat along the aisle while I sat the window. I slept for an hour after he arrived before slowly stirring to feeling something touch me. I looked up and his hand was pulling back from near my leg, odd. I decided to watch his hand again and sure enough it\u2019s slinking it\u2019s way towards my seat and near my thigh. At that point I said \u2018nope!\u2019 In my head and shoved my body as tight as I could against the window. Maybe he wanted more space, I don\u2019t know, but I really don\u2019t like being touched and thought I should give him more space. I finally had the courage to look over at him and ask to trade seats. This means he will have more room and I can get away from him easily. This thankfully goes with no misfire, and now I\u2019m close to the girls again, all is well\u2026 for five minutes.\n\n\nAfter a moment I notice he keeps looking at me. It\u2019s weird, but he\u2019s been staring quite a bit, and every time I look at him he looks back out the window. Here is where I\u2019m asking my question, because some of my friends said sometimes old people just stare if they\u2019re curious which I get, and I never saw exactly where he was staring, but it seemed to be the general area of my thighs and chest which made me very uncomfortable. After a few hours we are on the train and he takes a call. This is the second one he\u2019s taken on the train. First one was when he had just gotten on the train and he was completely paying attention to the person on the phone. This time, however, he tried to ask me a question which I just shook my head as the answer. After the call the conversation went like this:\n\n\nCG: creepy guy\n\nMe: your nervous wreak currently (may get some parts wrong)\n\n\nCG: Miss\n\nMe: *ignores him*\n\nCG: Miss, Miss, ExCUSE ME\n\nMe: sir I do not want to talk to you if I don\u2019t have to.\n\nCG:\u2026 do you have a problem with me?\n\nMe: you have been staring at me avidly this entire train ride and have made me uncomfortable.\n\n\nAnd from there it dissolved into him screaming at me saying how he never stared at me and that he served 26 years and has never been this disrespected and that he wished I would (not allowed to say what he said because the mods got mad at me) and that he had seen bigger and better and I was an ugly piece of shit and why would he even look at me. He told me if I was uncomfortable I should crawl back into the hole my mother had me from to be comfortable. He wouldn\u2019t stop calling me a piece of shit. He walked off after a minute to the dinning cart, where I broke down. The girls next to me made me sit in front of them and this nice dude who was originally behind me checked to make sure I was ok but then the guy came back to the cart and got on the phone. He started talking about me as I was getting off saying some girl was so rude to him. I genuinely feel like an asshole. I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have said anything unless I knew for sure and maybe he was a nice person put in a bad spot? Am I the asshole Reddit?",

    "postText": "We are a group of 4 friends and one of my friends told all of us to buy a 4 player co-op video game for approximately 30 bucks so that we can play together. At first, I was kinda hesitant because the game did not seem appealing to me and I tried to convince him to play some other game but at last I gave in and ended up buying the game just so that all 4 of us can have fun playing together even though I do not like the game.\n\nWe buy the game and it turns out that only 2 players can play together at once and I cannot even get a refund of the game as I have already downloaded it (Playstation ofc.). I get disappointed that I had to spend 30 bucks for a game that all of us can't play together. We are all college students and 30 dollars is still a good amount of money for me, and I am bit of a money saver (IDK if you wanna call me a miser too lmao) cuz I always think 5 times before spending money on anything. \n\nI just get frustrated and disappointed, but I do not swear or curse or say anything bad to the friend who made us buy the game. I just sounded a bit angry and I am guessing my friend figured it out too that I was disappointed but I tried to keep it cool. Just after that, I told my friend that you should buy us all food (cuz we sometimes buy each other drinks etc. and also buy another friend's meal and keep on rotating who pays for who (i.e. 2 guys pay for all four, and the next time the other two pay for all four of us) when we go out to eat). My friend sounded a little angry at that and I felt bad at asking him to do that. He is like a brother to me and I feel like an asshole prioritizing money over a friendship in this case. Should I have just let it go? I was just a bit disappointed but now I feel bad that I can always earn more money but should not have been a bit angry at a friend and asked him to buy us all food.",

I get you wanted to play with your friends despite the game not appealing to you, and that's commendable. \n\nNot sure why you can't get a refund as normally you have a certain amount of time to return a game even if opened. If digital download then PS store normally offers a refund too. Failing the above, just sell it (if a physical copy of course) and make some of your money back.\n\nAsking your friend to buy you food because you weren't happy with a purchase you made isn't really fair, IMO. \n\nDon't all out over small things like this. Put it behind you all and move forward.",

            "comment": "NTA. It sounds like you guys have a semi-casual rotation of buying meals. Seems reasonable asking him to pay for the next meal if you guys all bought a game to play together at his request, never mind that there was a mistake and only two can play the game. Tbh, I'd feel like he owed more than one meal for the game. You guys should still find a way to try to enjoy the game and you can't hold a grudge if you want to maintain the friendship, but imho, suggesting the meal to make up for the game mistake was a totally reasonable offer and he was the AH for getting touchy about it. \n\nIf you had demanded he refund your $30, it would be a different story and I think it's time to move on now, but a meal seemed like a fairly reasonable settlement offer.",

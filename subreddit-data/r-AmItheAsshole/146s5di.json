To move around the city, I rented a bicycle. This morning I went somewhere for breakfast before meeting a friend who lives here. After I finished breakfast and walked back to my bike, I saw that someone else had attached their bike to mine, preventing me from using my bike. This made me irritated, because now I was threatening to be late for my appointment. And I had no idea how long this situation was going to last. That's why I was fiddling with the other bike to see if I couldn't detach it from my bike after all. At that moment the owner of the other bike arrives and says: \"Hey, take it easy\". To which I angrily reply: \u201cCalm down, WTF is this? Why are you chaining your bike to mine?\" His response was, \u201cHey, I'm a local. So act normal. He was only attached to yours for 5 or 10 minutes. This is Berlin. Just have a beer.\u201d This makes me even angrier and I said, \u201cFuck off your Berlin. I have absolutely no idea how long this will take. You really are an asshole. Fuck you.\u201d He then unhooked his bike and angrily said I was the asshole here. Because I didn't have to behave like that for something so small.\u201d Was he right?\n\nTL;DR I lost my temper and got mad at a stranger who locked his bike to mine.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

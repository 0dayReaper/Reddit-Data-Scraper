    "postText": "When I (16,F) was 10 years old I went on a Ski-Trip with my school.\n\n One evening I didn\u2019t like the Food so I didn\u2019t eat much of it. After the main course they served desert and I ate my portion. Me and my Friends saw that there were still many portions left so each one of my friends took a second portion. Before we took seconds, we asked the Chef and he said that it was okay. As we were eating our Teacher furiously came up to us and just startet screaming at me in front of literally the whole school. \nShe was so mad that I took a second portion even tho all my friends did too. She told me that I am an ungrateful Child and a Fat disgusting person. \nAfter she said these mean things to my 10 year old self I immediate started bursting out in tears and then decided to go to my room. I was so embarrassed I didn\u2019t even tell my Parents when I arrived home, also I was afraid that they would side with her, because growing up my parents always told me that I was too fat also.\n\nA few days ago my Parents brought up that teacher and I was instantly reminded of what she said to me 6 years ago even tho I lost all that weight I still remember her words to this day. I finally was ready to tell my Parents about it and they got mad at me for not telling them before because they said the would have done something.\n\nSo AITA?",

Your parents getting angry at your waiting to share it is a great indicator of why it took so long for you to talk to them when it happened. It is possible they are angry they couldn't protect you at the time? But that is the parents' responsibility to make sure their child feels safe talking to them about bad things that happen not the child's fault if they don't feel able to do so.",

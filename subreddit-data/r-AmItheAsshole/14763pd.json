The reason so many WOC feel the need to WEAR wigs is because of centuries of being told that their natural hair was hideous and undesirable.\n\nYou need to give her a big, huge genuine apology, and that's not enough. You need to tell her that you understand that you were ignorant, and tells her that you know you can't possibly TRULY understand what it's like to be a WOC. And then you need to ask her what she needs from you, to get past this emotionally. And then you need to DO that.",

We make them taboo and that\u2019s how they become so sensitive. Because they\u2019re taboo. And then because that taboo is perpetuated, people don\u2019t see black hair very often, so they\u2019re not familiar with it and they expect black people would all have weaves and wear wigs, so kinky and coiled textured hair becomes an eccentricity. It doesn\u2019t need to be that way.

If perhaps these were wigs for cosplaying or something, then this would have played out differently. Clearly you didn't know better and assumed they were not of such serious emotional and sentimental value. Wigs that are meant for daily appearances can have a much more emotional impact on someone due to whatever private reasons they are wearing it. For example, someone recovering from chemo who is embarrassed by the hair loss. No one in the right mind would ever dare call them out or make fun of them for wearing a wig.\n\nYou'll definitely need to make it up to her for this, and really prove that you weren't trying to do any harm. It's a lesson you have now learned, if a bit poorly.\n\nEdit: changed from soft Y-T-A to regular.",

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo, my girlfriend (20F) and I (23M) have been dating for about a year now, and we've always had a playful and lighthearted relationship. Today, she had to go out for a few hours, and I was home alone. I decided to use the opportunity to clean the bathroom. As I was tidying up, I noticed a box tucked away in one of the cabinets. Being curious, I opened it and found several wigs inside.\n\nNow, it's important to mention that my girlfriend is black, and she often wears different wigs as a way to change up her style. I've always admired her confidence and versatility when it comes to her hair, and I've never had an issue with it.\n\nHowever, in that moment, I thought it would be funny to try on one of the wigs and surprise her when she got back. I didn't see any harm in it because we've always shared a good sense of humor, and I genuinely didn't think she would be upset.\n\nSo, I put on one of the wigs and looked at myself in the mirror. I must admit, it was pretty amusing. I decided to take it a step further and started joking around, doing silly dances and making exaggerated expressions in the mirror. In my mind, it was all just harmless fun, and I didn't mean any harm by it.\n\nUnfortunately, my girlfriend returned earlier than expected and caught me in the act. The moment she walked in, she had this look of shock and sadness on her face. I immediately took off the wig and tried to explain that it was just a joke, but she didn't say a word. She quietly went into our bedroom, and I could hear her sobbing softly.\n\nFeeling terrible about what I had done, I knocked on the bedroom door and asked if I could come in. She didn't respond, so I slowly entered and found her sitting on the edge of the bed, her face buried in her hands. I tried to comfort her and apologize, but she just looked up at me, tears streaming down her face.\n\nShe explained to me that the reason she wears wigs is not just for style, but also because she feels insecure about her natural hair. She opened up about how society often places unfair expectations on Black women's hair, and how she sometimes struggles with her own self-image. Seeing me make fun of the wigs, even in a lighthearted way, triggered all those insecurities and made her feel ashamed.\n\nI felt like the worst person in the world for causing her pain, and I truly never intended for my actions to hurt her. I apologized profusely and told her that I would never make light of something that meant so much to her again. I assured her that I love and support her no matter what, and that I would do whatever it takes to make it right.\n\nNow, we're at a bit of an impasse. She accepted my apology but needs some space to process everything. She's decided to stay with a friend for a couple of days to clear her mind. I completely understand and respect her need for space, but I can't help but feel like I've damaged our relationship irreparably.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

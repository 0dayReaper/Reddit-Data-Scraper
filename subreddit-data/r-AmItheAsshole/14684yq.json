    "postText": "Usual disclaimer about formatting, I\u2019m on mobile.\n\nI (20m) wait tables. This story is about one of the cooks (50m), we will call him G.\n\nFor some background, from the very beginning G and I have not gotten along. He sexually harassed me for months (saying my \u201cass is fat\u201d, if he was my age he would \u201csmash\u201d, etc). It took him harassing two of our underaged servers before management shut him down. Unfortunately, he did not lose his job due to understaffing. He has a piss poor attitude and starts arguments with me, the other servers, the other cook, even our manager!\n\nHe\u2019s made inappropriate comments about religion to me, such as I\u2019m living in sin with my fianc\u00e9 because I moved in with him before marriage. \n\nI\u2019ve learned to ignore him.\n\nLately his favorite thing to argue about is giving away \u201cfree\u201d food. And by that I mean what he assumes is free just because a ticket isn\u2019t in right this very second. Once I asked for extra sausage during a rush and every time I stepped back in that kitchen he asked about the sausage. It was only when I finally put the ticket in that he shut up. \n\nToday a regular of ours ordered a carryout meal and G forgot to give him a large portion of his meal. This regular lives 15 minutes away so when he came back and asked if he could buy some bacon I told him not to worry about it and it would be on the house as an apology. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty important to mention that my manager has given me free reign to do things like this when she\u2019s not here.\n\nI went to get him the bacon and G proceeded to hound me over it for several minutes. I left the conversation two times only for him to continue it the moment I needed back into the kitchen. I told him bacon was only $2.50 and that I\u2019d message the owner and ask him if it\u2019s an issue and if it was I\u2019d cover it myself. He asked me why I would do that. I told him because he was making a big deal out of nothing and to mind his own damn business.  At this point he got angry and told me he wasn\u2019t going to do anything without a ticket, not to talk to him like that, and that he didn\u2019t have to do anything I told him to do.\n\nI just couldn\u2019t take his shit anymore and I told him to stop acting like a dick.\n\nSince then he\u2019s tried to \u201capologize\u201d aka basically try to hug me and say I started it but we can be okay again (lol seriously?) I had to put $2.50 in the register to truly end the argument. I\u2019ve spoken to my manager and I have refused to work with him unless someone else is in the building. She agreed but I was the last server willing to work alone with him so his hours will be drastically cut down. I feel a little guilty to mess with his money but I feel like he made his bed and it\u2019s time to lie in it.\n\nAita?",

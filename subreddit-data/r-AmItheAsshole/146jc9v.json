    "postText": "My parents offered myself and my siblings all the same deal. We could have $25,000 as soon as we graduated from high school or we could wait until we graduated from college, got a trade, or were self supporting for the next four years and get $125,000. \n\nMy two oldest brothers went to college and used the money to start their lives. My older brother who didn't take that option took his $25,000 and moved to SE Asia. He lived pretty well for three years. Then he ran out of money and had to come home. \n\nMy parents welcomed him home and let him live there while he found a job. He ended up going to university and is working on getting his teaching degree. \n\nI just graduated and I'm using the money to put a downpayment on a house. My brother approached me and asked if I would share some of my money so he could buy a car. My parents are letting him live at home and paying for his college but they aren't giving him any spending money or anything. \n\nI said I didn't think it was fair that I should have to share the money I was getting from our parents since I had fulfilled my end of the bargain. \n\nHe said I was a dumbass for not going out and seeing the world. I'm not sure how much he saw stuck in a country in SE Asia during Covid. He thinks I'm being a greedy asshole for not sharing my money. I think he should have done something with the last three years besides see the world.  \n\nHe said he could have made it four years if it wasn't for the pandemic. I said it would not have mattered since he had already taken the money. Our mom heard us arguing and told him to leave me alone. My money was earn d with hard work and I don't have to share. \n\nI talked to my other brothers and they both said he had asked them for money too but they told him to get bent.  \n\nI know it doesn't seem fair but he chose to party with his money. It's not my fault that the world went nuts for a couple of years.  \n\nAITA?",

But frankly your parents were very irresponsible to offer this option to a 18-year-old; sure, it worked fine for 3 out of 4 children, but it's the ones who don't have things figured out that need parenting the most, and your parents dropped the ball. Promising a big payout for successfully adulting for 4 years is a great way to make sure your kids learn responsibility; giving them the option of a chunk of cash the minute they are adults is just setting the less mature one for failure.",

They seem very comfortable. OPs brother was never gonna fail unless he became an addict or similar and that would have been a whole different kind of failure. \n\nThey gave his brother the 25k, as agreed, let him have some fun for 3 yrs and now they are paying for him to get a good education. They also house and feed him. They just won't pay for funnsies anymore. \n\nIt seems OPs parents wanted to teach the kids the worth of hard work and money, but still set them up with a comfortable start regardless. That's not a bad thing. \n\nAt some point kids/adults need to learn how to make (financial) decisions and take responsibility for them. It doesn't start at 18 with 25k, it already starts with pocket money and chores much earlier. The brother made a bad choice at 18, but not back breaking or life destroying. If he doesn't learn from his mistakes now at 21, he wasn't going to learn later either. He probably would have \"wasted\" the 125k too. Or maybe the experiences gained would have been worth it to him - also a valid choice. \n\n3 out 4 kids turned out financially responsible it seems. It also sounds like they were all parented more or less the same. Kids are individuals. You can do everything the same but it can still have different results. \n\nIf OPs brother prefers a bit more hedonistic lifestyle that's perfectly valid. But he's an adult and now he has to figure out how he can sustain that lifestyle and set priorities for himself. That's prime adulting. That's part of growing up. Nobody else can sort out his priorities for him. \n\nYes, 18 and 21 is still young, but you need to let your adult child make their own choices and mistakes to learn from them. OPs parents still provide a comfortable fall back it seems, should things ever go drastically wrong. That's honestly the best thing you can do for a child if you can afford it. \n\nIf you force them to make the safe, responsible choice, do they really learn anything?",

We could have $25,000 as soon as we graduated from high school or we could wait until we graduated from college, got a trade, or were self supporting for the next four years and get $125,000. \n\nMy two oldest brothers went to college and used the money to start their lives. My older brother who didn't take that option took his $25,000 and moved to SE Asia. He lived pretty well for three years. Then he ran out of money and had to come home. \n\nMy parents welcomed him home and let him live there while he found a job. He ended up going to university and is working on getting his teaching degree. \n\nI just graduated and I'm using the money to put a downpayment on a house. My brother approached me and asked if I would share some of my money so he could buy a car. My parents are letting him live at home and paying for his college but they aren't giving him any spending money or anything. \n\nI said I didn't think it was fair that I should have to share the money I was getting from our parents since I had fulfilled my end of the bargain. \n\nHe said I was a dumbass for not going out and seeing the world. I'm not sure how much he saw stuck in a country in SE Asia during Covid. He thinks I'm being a greedy asshole for not sharing my money. I think he should have done something with the last three years besides see the world.  \n\nHe said he could have made it four years if it wasn't for the pandemic. I said it would not have mattered since he had already taken the money. Our mom heard us arguing and told him to leave me alone. My money was earn d with hard work and I don't have to share. \n\nI talked to my other brothers and they both said he had asked them for money too but they told him to get bent.  \n\nI know it doesn't seem fair but he chose to party with his money. It's not my fault that the world went nuts for a couple of years.  \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have bought cash cars for two of my grandchildren to my daughter let\u2019s call her \u201cH\u201d when one was 17 and the other was 19. One car was bought off of H for $1000 or so and give it to her daughter and she drove it for over 5 years.. the other car was bought off of a friend, and given to H\u2019s son, which he completely destroyed within two years.\nI also bought a car for our adopted granddaughter because she had a baby and needed a good vehicle. I paid for the down payment and she paid the rest of it off and is still driving it to this day 6+ years later.\nMy daughter and her husband think that I owe owe my grandson P a car.\nI just paid $10,000 out of pocket for my daughter H to have weight loss surgery.\nShe has done good on it and lost 100 pounds in six months, but she doesn\u2019t seem very grateful for it and still disrespects me.\nToday their car that they bought on their own broke down, and my daughter called bitching at me saying if P had a car they could get still get around.\nI can\u2019t afford a car right now even though they think I\u2019m made of money with the economy and just having paid $10,000 for her surgery. I also don\u2019t wanna have to deal with the drama of them, destroying another car and me getting blamed because it was a \u201ca bad car\u201d and \u201call my fault\u201d.\nOn top of paying for her surgery, I shoveled the money, constant gas money, date money, clothes money for prom and more . Her husband has a good job she says at least $80,000 a year and she works as well probably around $30,000 a year. I\u2019m just tired and I feel like I owe them things but I know I shouldn\u2019t.. am I the asshole?\n\n\nMore details: \nH is a very domineering person. She blames me for not being around when she was a kid. I lived in Colorado after the divorce with her dad and I feel like she has been punishing me ever since. At first she would use my grandchildren like a hostage situation. She has mental illness of some kind and goes crazy and makes everyone\u2019s lives miserable if things are not going her way. So that is why I try and help out",

If you're looking to keep the peace I would say grandson P could have a car in a year or two, after all the others were older when they got one. I think your daughter is treating you like her ATM and you need to take a stand. Especially if she is not even acting grateful. \nFor grandson P I could see that no car would feel very unfair to him, especially bc he was not the onto ruin the last. I would have many conversations about responsibility with him if you decide to fund his car in the future. \nBTW you sound like an amazingly generous grandma who deserves love and appreciation.",

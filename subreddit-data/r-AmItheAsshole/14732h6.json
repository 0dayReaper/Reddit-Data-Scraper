    "postText": "My girlfriend recently had a aunt pass away last week so she had to fly back home over the weekend for the funeral, my girlfriend was in pretty rough shape because of it. \n\nI recently had my work van breakdown and it\u2019s been in the shop for a few weeks now. I need the van to work so I\u2019ve had to put some jobs on hold until I get my van running again. I can only do my work if I have my van running and money has been tight. I\u2019ve already had to ask my mom for a couple grand when the mechanic had to order parts and I\u2019ll probably had to ask my mom for another couple grand when I pick up my van next week because I\u2019ve had no way to make enough money.\n\nMy girlfriend is flying home this evening and her flight comes in an hour from when my mom is going to have her birthday dinner. My mom dinner is also about 2 to 1 1/2 hour drive from the airport so it would be impossible to do both. \n\nSo am I the asshole for wanting to go to my moms birthday dinner instead picking up my girlfriend? I asked my girlfriend if she could take an Uber and now she\u2019s pissed. I might just tell my mom I can\u2019t make it to her dinner but I\u2019ll be having to ask her for a couple grand in a couple days and I feel bad not being able to make it then instantly asking her for money. I think mom would understand but it feels shitty. \n\nAlso I\u2019m watching my girlfriends kids and we were going to meet her at the airport. If I went to my moms birthday dinner the teenage one would babysit the other kids until she came home. I\u2019m trying to find the best option here.",

You already agreed. \n\nHave you talked to your mother about it at all? It\u2019s not exactly a normal situation, and birthdays are an annual thing. You can also do something for her the next day or get her a nice gift. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for either decision, but I think since you already agreed to pick up your girlfriend knowing your moms birthday dinner was happening, you should explain the dilemma to your mom. Most people understand these situations, so if your mom is reasonable, she\u2019s understand the aunt passed and it\u2019s not a normal thing.",

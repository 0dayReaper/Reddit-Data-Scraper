    "postText": "I'm a photographer. Mostly I do industrial photography. If you have ever seen a brochure for a company you understand the kind of work I do. I have taken more pictures of warehouses, bulldozers, building sites, and work crews than you can imagine. \n\nI also do wedding photos on the side. Whenever my friends and family ask me to do their pictures I offer to do them at a steep discount. So far everyone has taken me up on it. Let's just say that there is no way they would pay less than three times what I offer to do the wedding for if they went with another PROFESSIONAL photographer. \n\nTwice it was sort of an issue. They objected to me wanting to be paid. One came back and apologized when they shopped around and saw what the real price was. The other chose to get her neighbor's son \"who is really good with his camera\" to do the pictures. I brought my camera but not all my equipment to that wedding and enjoyed taking pictures as a guest. I ended up giving them an album of my pictures for their first anniversary and they were insanely thankful. They never said anything to me because they were embarrassed but the kid fucked up. \n\nSo now the story.  My brother asked me to take pictures at his wedding. I said sure and quoted him a price. He said that I should just do it as a wedding gift. I said the price was my wedding gift. He said that his fiancee also expected me to get them a gift off the registry.  I said no.  I said I would be more than happy to attend as a guest and got on my phone in front of him and got a gift off their registry.  I said since I had now purchased a gift I would not be taking pictures. I will probably still being my camera because I like taking pictures. \n\nHe said I'm being an asshole and cheap since it doesn't cost me anything to take pictures and I shouldn't try and make money off him. I told him that I needed my bathroom remodel done and I wanted done at cost of materials since he is a contractor and it will cost him nothing in labor if he does all the work himself. \n\nOur parents are staying out of it because they know I have always been paid for taking pictures. Only my brother and the bride's side of the family think I'm in the wrong.  \n\nAITA?",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI'm a photographer. Mostly I do industrial photography. If you have ever seen a brochure for a company you understand the kind of work I do. I have taken more pictures of warehouses, bulldozers, building sites, and work crews than you can imagine. \n\nI also do wedding photos on the side. Whenever my friends and family ask me to do their pictures I offer to do them at a steep discount. So far everyone has taken me up on it. Let's just say that there is no way they would pay less than three times what I offer to do the wedding for if they went with another PROFESSIONAL photographer. \n\nTwice it was sort of an issue. They objected to me wanting to be paid. One came back and apologized when they shopped around and saw what the real price was. The other chose to get her neighbor's son \"who is really good with his camera\" to do the pictures. I brought my camera but not all my equipment to that wedding and enjoyed taking pictures as a guest. I ended up giving them an album of my pictures for their first anniversary and they were insanely thankful. They never said anything to me because they were embarrassed but the kid fucked up. \n\nSo now the story.  My brother asked me to take pictures at his wedding. I said sure and quoted him a price. He said that I should just do it as a wedding gift. I said the price was my wedding gift. He said that his fiancee also expected me to get them a gift off the registry.  I said no.  I said I would be more than happy to attend as a guest and got on my phone in front of him and got a gift off their registry.  I said since I had now purchased a gift I would not be taking pictures. I will probably still being my camera because I like taking pictures. \n\nHe said I'm being an asshole and cheap since it doesn't cost me anything to take pictures and I shouldn't try and make money off him. I told him that I needed my bathroom remodel done and I wanted done at cost of materials since he is a contractor and it will cost him nothing in labor if he does all the work himself. \n\nOur parents are staying out of it because they know I have always been paid for taking pictures. Only my brother and the bride's side of the family think I'm in the wrong.  \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

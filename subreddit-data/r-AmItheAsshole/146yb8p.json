The snoring &amp; talking stopped and he slept a deeper sleep.\n2) he was put on restless leg syndrome meds. No more bruises on my shins.\n3) we started using weighted blankets. It stopped the constant tossing &amp; turning.\n4) we got a king size adjustable bed. It\u2019s 2 twin beds. He could bunny hop on his side &amp; I wouldn\u2019t know it.\n\nI sleep so much better now. So does he.",

He talks in his sleep, grunts, and makes weird noises. He'll kick the bed and flail his arms around and elbow me. He's a truck driver so we don't get to see each other a whole lot but AITA because it's gotten to where I don't want to sleep in the same bed as him??\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "postText": "I (33 f) don't have good relationship with my parents. Long story short, my parents are toxic, they didn't treated me and my brother (now 29 m) equally, but he also suffered a lot from them.\n\nBecause of that I'm not a 'family person', but when I turned 30 it was the time when covid hit. We weren't allowed to party, so I thought that I could spend it with my brother and my parents, just not to be alone in that special day. I came to their house at the weekend with a bottle of wine just to sit and spend some time together. They didn't buy me even a small present, just transferred me some money. My brother said that he doesn't have time for such things and left. After one glass of wine, my mother who was scrolling all evening through facebook, yelled at me and my father that we are alcoholics etc. So I ended up saying that I'm tired and went to bed and go home the next day.\n\nAnd this year I told them BTW that I would like to get an orange tree, bc I always dreamed about growing one. My mother again transferred me money (a lot, but still didn't make an effort to buy me something 10x cheaper) and called me many times saying that they will visit me on my 33 birthday, drink some coffee etc. I didn't want to confront them with my feelings about my 30, especially because in the mean time my mother's sister had her 60 birthday. My mother did everything to organize a surprise party for her, ordered a cake, gathered the rest of their siblings, made me buy her a gift from everyone, almost two months preparations. She also organized my father's birthday and retirement.\n\nSo when she suddenly remembered that my birthday was also important I refused to spend that time with them. It was 3 years too late. She was really offended and denied everything, but had to accept my decision. A month later my brother had his birthday, they made a barbecue, father ordered him a birthday cake. The next day she even told me that if I would allow them to visit me on my birthday, I would also had a cake. Right, so as always my fault.\n\nAnd now the real problem is that I really want and need to buy my own apartment. I saved some money, have to take a loan and still don't know if it will be enough. So I asked my parents to lend me some money (they agreed and don't want me to give it back, bc I don't want anything from them, even the family house, I left it for my brother). On the one hand I feel bad for rejecting them while they still want to help me. On the other hand these small acts and situations hurt me, I've always felt like I'm worse, not enough to them. At the back of my head I also think that it's easier for them to give me money and get over with it, minimum effort and nobody tell them that they didn't help and try. I still didn't take that money from them and if it'll be possible, I won't do it and won't take any other help from them. Or maybe I'm just ungrateful and overreacting as they always told me.",

Like yes, maybe they could have gotten you a cake, but instead they gave you money. Maybe tell them next time you would like something else, and don't be surprised when their generosity stops.\n\nTo outsiders, you do kind of sound like an ingrate, complaining about getting money. It's easy to say money isn't everything when they're giving it to you so freely, lol. I think you need to not focus so much on birthday presents. Let it go. I think there are bigger problems you might want to address with your parents, like the lack of communication, but stop bringing up birthday presents",

Perhaps when they were younger, money would have been so helpful to them so giving money to you does mean something important to them.  It also sounds like when they realize you expected something different, they tried to somehow make it up to you.  I'm not so sure they mean to slight you and hope you can look at them in this light and then enjoy and appreciate what they do offer.\n\nAs for asking them for money to get your apartment, I think their being willing to do this without repayment is more than I could ever expect from my parents.  Parents are not perfect and do not meet our every desire but you clearly have parents willing to do a lot for you and I'd say it's time to give up childish resentments and appreciate their generosity.",

Long story short, my parents are toxic, they didn't treated me and my brother (now 29 m) equally, but he also suffered a lot from them.\n\nBecause of that I'm not a 'family person', but when I turned 30 it was the time when covid hit. We weren't allowed to party, so I thought that I could spend it with my brother and my parents, just not to be alone in that special day. I came to their house at the weekend with a bottle of wine just to sit and spend some time together. They didn't buy me even a small present, just transferred me some money. My brother said that he doesn't have time for such things and left. After one glass of wine, my mother who was scrolling all evening through facebook, yelled at me and my father that we are alcoholics etc. So I ended up saying that I'm tired and went to bed and go home the next day.\n\nAnd this year I told them BTW that I would like to get an orange tree, bc I always dreamed about growing one. My mother again transferred me money (a lot, but still didn't make an effort to buy me something 10x cheaper) and called me many times saying that they will visit me on my 33 birthday, drink some coffee etc. I didn't want to confront them with my feelings about my 30, especially because in the mean time my mother's sister had her 60 birthday. My mother did everything to organize a surprise party for her, ordered a cake, gathered the rest of their siblings, made me buy her a gift from everyone, almost two months preparations. She also organized my father's birthday and retirement.\n\nSo when she suddenly remembered that my birthday was also important I refused to spend that time with them. It was 3 years too late. She was really offended and denied everything, but had to accept my decision. A month later my brother had his birthday, they made a barbecue, father ordered him a birthday cake. The next day she even told me that if I would allow them to visit me on my birthday, I would also had a cake. Right, so as always my fault.\n\nAnd now the real problem is that I really want and need to buy my own apartment. I saved some money, have to take a loan and still don't know if it will be enough. So I asked my parents to borrow me some money (they agreed and don't want me to give it back, bc I don't want anything from them, even the family house, I left it for my brother). On the one hand I feel bad for rejecting them while they still want to help me. On the other hand these small acts and situations hurt me, I've always felt like I'm worse, not enough to them. At the back of my head I also think that it's easier for them to give me money and get over with it, minimum effort and nobody tell them that they didn't help and try. I still didn't take that money from them and if it'll be possible, I won't do it and won't take any other help from them. Or maybe I'm just ungrateful and overreacting as they always told me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Have you always been the kind of person that lets it go when this happens?  You may want to talk to a professional counsellor about some of the things that are bothering you as it doesn't seem likely this will correct itself naturally.  For you to be an emotionally healthy adult, you may need to either deal with them directly and confidently, or reduce your contact and expectations so you aren't disappointed continually.

But now asking them for a loan to buy a house seems like hypocrisy. I would put that matter aside for now.\n\nMaybe you can write them a letter explaining how you feel about the way they have treated you compared to others. Don't blame, don't attack them. \n\nFor example, something like this: \"I feel sad that I don't seem important enough to you to have my birthdays celebated. It really hurts when I see the effort you make for my brother and others, when I just receive a money transfer. I feel like I don't matter, that I don't count as a family member.\" You can add that you would like to talk about it calmly with them so all of you can get a better understanding of one another. \n\nGood luck with everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"",

    "postText": "I [25m] started working at my company about a year ago. My boss [48m] and I really hit it off. So much so, that he frequently visits and sleeps on the couch in our basement. \n\nMy fiancee [23f] and I have lived together for several years now, and just recently built a house together, so it has plenty of space and she doesn\u2019t mind him staying in the basement, but they don\u2019t interact much.\n\nMonths ago I purchased tickets for a local charity event that I had taken my fiancee to last year. I did not indicate I would take her this year, but she assumed the 2nd ticket was for her.\n\nLast evening we had a difficult code deployment that my boss and I were up quite late for. After its success we had a nightcap and I mentioned the charity event this weekend and he mentioned he had always wanted to go, so I invited him to go under my 2nd ticket. He was elated, and I thought also this would be good for my career progression as charity is a cornerstone of the company we work for.\n\nI told my fiancee this morning that my boss had never been to the event and was excited to go. She said that we would all have a great time as last year was so much fun. I then told her that there were only 2 tickets and she wasn\u2019t going.\n\nNeedless to say she was pissed. Tickets are sold out already, so I can\u2019t just buy another. I told her that she needs to be considerate of my career progression and that I can always take her again next year.",

Boss is probably behind on the maturity scale. Sleeping on your buddy\u2019s couch is a 20-something thing to do. Hanging out with your direct reports socially is a 20-something thing to do (not like have a drink at the bar after work functions, but like *hang out*).\n\nBoss is functioning at a 20-something level and he\u2019s on track to be an HR nightmare, if he isn\u2019t already.\n\nOP, take your fianc\u00e9e. Your boss won\u2019t be a part of your life in 5 years. You\u2019re going to grow up anc hut your 30s, while your boss will be perpetually 20-something. Hopefully, if you wise up and treat your fianc\u00e9e like your life partner and not your afterthought, she WILL be in your life in 5 years.\n\nYTA",

She hooked up with a lad who'd later get promoted to shift manager (it's important that they started hooking up when they were both crew, the lad didn't use authority or anything to get her in bed). BUT once he did get that promotion he couldn't recommend her, or give her employee of the shift, or anything like that because everyone's knee jerk jealousy reaction would be \"well she's the only one sucking him off twice a day course he voted her\"\n\nThis applies to every closer than professional relationship - be it good golf buddies to what OP has to a sexual relationship with superiors. Getting close and friendly in an unprofessional way with superiors is actually the worst move you can make for career progression because that person is no longer treated as objective and impartial when trying to move you up the ladder",

I get that.\n\nYour boss may not have real awareness about his extremely bad behavior because he built the culture and the (inappropriate practices). It all seems fine probably. \n\nThis experience is similar to what i saw when i was  your age in tech. The traditional rules didn't apply, and yes,  i knew a boss that slept on others couches, partied with his immediate reports. For years he had a little cloud of his like you that he used as friends and resources. It was cringy.\n\nThe problem was: the young people didn't benefit from these relationships with their \"cool\" boss. Some of them stayed employed who otherwise would have been fired because they were shit professionally, but the high quality guys didn't move up at all. They should have bypassed boss over the years,  and he kept them under him. He bought his friends, and by God they were going to stay just where he could find them and use them!\n\nEven if your situation isn't as bad as it seems, or as nuts as my work environment was, please take note that as you age, your privacy will matter more. And it may matter a great deal to your wife already. Everything is good until it's not.  What about the first time the boss does a little thing out of line at your house? The next time? You cannot as easily reverse out of a personal+profesional relationship. Reclaiming your privacy will be a delicate task if you want to stay in his good graces/ remain employed. \n\nIt's very challenging to carefully walk back out of the entangled situation you're in now. Next time, don't get in it to begin with. If you have a boss that asks to hang out, you just stay silent. Silence is golden, my buddy. Just let someone else pipe up and you may say \"love to catch a beer with you sometime\" and then don't do it.",

            "comment": "YTA and it's of your own making pal. You messed up, if you considered that 2nd ticket as going free when you bought it then you should have said to your fianc\u00e9e. If you didn't mean to invite your boss but it just happened, then you got two options (but make sure your fianc\u00e9e is in on your decision): a) lie and say something's come up, give your boss your tickets and do something nice with your partner instead OR b) fess up and tell your boss you double booked the tickets. If your fianc\u00e9e is cool with it, you could say she was meant to be out of town but now something's come up and you always go together etc etc (just make sure she's okay with being a scape goat)\n\nDoes stuff like this happen a lot with your boss? I get the impression he might be steamrolling you a bit tbh - you sound like me, I'm pretty laid back and not comfortable 'confronting' people which has meant friends (and bosses actually) have kinda taken advantage of this and talked me into favours or covering shifts etc just by talking as if I'd already agreed. I was never comfortable to say \"no, that's not what's happened.\" If that doesn't sound like you, ignore this paragraph, but might be helpful to be wary if he's a bit of a steamroller - you'll have to stand your ground to stop it repeating.",

    "postText": "My fianc\u00e9 and I usually host my fianc\u00e9s aunt, her son, and her grandchildren to stay each summer for a week or two. For reference, we also have four children of our own.\n\nThis past winter, our aunt and her son came to stay for a couple of weeks while their plumbing and electrical was being repaired. Our aunt went back home (about 7 hours away) to check in on the repairs, leaving her son here with us. (TBH we felt like she needed a break from her son. He still lives at home with his mom, and has recently started having seizures due to a bad reaction to alcohol.) \n\nWe do have cameras throughout our home, and I did let our aunt and her son know that, not because I suspected anything, but just so they weren\u2019t weirded out if they noticed them and I -didn\u2019t- say anything. The cameras aren\u2019t in any \u201csleeping\u201d or \u201cdressing\u201d areas, just like, our kitchen, our sunroom, and our kids living room and both entry ways.\n\nHis cousin let us know that he had drank the last 3-4 sodas in the fridge and wanted to get a ride into town to buy more, and that he had money. (He doesn\u2019t drive due to seizures, and he doesn\u2019t have a job, but his mom had left him with some money.)\n\nThat evening, my fianc\u00e9 and I were sitting in the living room watching TV, and his cousin got up and went to our kitchen in the middle of a show. I figured he was just grabbing a snack or going to have a cigarette. We heard a lot of shuffling going on, and then we heard a glass jar and a bunch of change jingling. We keep a jar in our kitchen for \u201cpocket dump\u201d when we get home, which is mainly change. My fianc\u00e9 called from the living room towards the kitchen, and his cousin responded saying he was getting his money ready for the trip to town. \n\nI opened the camera app on my phone, and I watched him dump the entire contents (which came out to around $23 in change after checking it) of our change jar into his pockets. I recorded it and my fianc\u00e9 and I both watched it happen. His cousin then came back in, and was acting extremely weird. My fianc\u00e9 confronted him, and his cousin denied it, so then my fianc\u00e9 showed him the video. His cousin then handed over the pocketful of change, but never apologized or acknowledged it. I immediately was upset. I wanted him out that night. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 then ended up having to drive 14 hours round trip overnight to drive his cousin home. We both agreed this was the best course of action. We let his mom know what happened, and she was upset with her son. We let him know that it would not be likely for him to return in the future. \n\nThis happened 3.5 months ago. \n\nNow next week, aunt and her two grandchildren are coming for their normal visit, and she\u2019s been hinting that her son wants to join her. My fianc\u00e9 and I are not ready for his cousins return, but we welcome the other family. She seems upset that we haven\u2019t had a change of heart. So\u2026AWTA?",

He lives with her under the guise of he is there to \u201chelp her\u201d with tasks. (Her husband, thief\u2019s adoptive father, was killed in a motorcycle accident three years ago. Her health has continued to decline.) there\u2019s a further depth, as expected with family, and I could go on, but none of those things exempt him from being held accountable and responsible for the consequences to his actions in my mind.",

If he will blatantly steal knowing you have cameras, then lie about it until you present evidence, then he declined to acknowledge his wrong or apologize, indicates to me he has no conscience and there is no telling what he is capable of.  Psychopaths are people who have no conscience and are capable of wreaking destruction on those they come in contact with \n\nThere is no telling what all he does to his mother.  He probably steals her meds, steals her money, he probably threatens her when she does give him what he wants, and she is probably afraid of him and what he can do. And maybe what he has done \n\nJust from what youve written you should have concerns that he is committing  elder abuse,   financial abuse and possibly physical abuse.\n\nHe should not be alone with his mother or have access to her home or finances",

For reference, we also have four children of our own.\n\nThis past winter, our aunt and her son came to stay for a couple of weeks while their plumbing and electrical was being repaired. Our aunt went back home (about 7 hours away) to check in on the repairs, leaving her son here with us. (TBH we felt like she needed a break from her son. He still lives at home with his mom, and has recently started having seizures due to a bad reaction to alcohol.) \n\nWe do have cameras throughout our home, and I did let our aunt and her son know that, not because I suspected anything, but just so they weren\u2019t weirded out if they noticed them and I -didn\u2019t- say anything. The cameras aren\u2019t in any \u201csleeping\u201d or \u201cdressing\u201d areas, just like, our kitchen, our sunroom, and our kids living room and both entry ways.\n\nHis cousin let us know that he had drank the last 3-4 sodas in the fridge and wanted to get a ride into town to buy more, and that he had money. (He doesn\u2019t drive due to seizures, and he doesn\u2019t have a job, but his mom had left him with some money.)\n\nThat evening, my fianc\u00e9 and I were sitting in the living room watching TV, and his cousin got up and went to our kitchen in the middle of a show. I figured he was just grabbing a snack or going to have a cigarette. We heard a lot of shuffling going on, and then we heard a glass jar and a bunch of change jingling. We keep a jar in our kitchen for \u201cpocket dump\u201d when we get home, which is mainly change. My fianc\u00e9 called from the living room towards the kitchen, and his cousin responded saying he was getting his money ready for the trip to town. \n\nI opened the camera app on my phone, and I watched him dump the entire contents (which came out to around $23 in change after checking it) of our change jar into his pockets. I recorded it and my fianc\u00e9 and I both watched it happen. His cousin then came back in, and was acting extremely weird. My fianc\u00e9 confronted him, and his cousin denied it, so then my fianc\u00e9 showed him the video. His cousin then handed over the pocketful of change, but never apologized or acknowledged it. I immediately was upset. I wanted him out that night. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 then ended up having to drive 14 hours round trip overnight to drive his cousin home. We both agreed this was the best course of action. We let his mom know what happened, and she was upset with her son. We let him know that it would not be likely for him to return in the future. \n\nThis happened 3.5 months ago. \n\nNow next week, aunt and her two grandchildren are coming for their normal visit, and she\u2019s been hinting that her son wants to join her. My fianc\u00e9 and I are not ready for his cousins return, but we welcome the other family. She seems upset that we haven\u2019t had a change of heart. So\u2026AWTA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

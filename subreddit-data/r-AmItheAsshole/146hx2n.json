    "postText": "So I, (16m) and my mom live together, I have set rules, yet they are not usually punished for forgetting to do them once and a while, so I was getting over a breakup with a guy and just didn\u2019t have the will power to go wash dishes and quite frankly they weren\u2019t my biggest priority. so come time my mom gets off work and she starts screaming at me because she doesn\u2019t want to get off work and do my chores. Which is valid but, I, knowing I screwed up, told my mom I could just hand wash them and she retorted with \u201cno, if you wanted to do them you would\u2019ve done them by now, but you didn\u2019t.\u201d and I feel that was unnecessary because I get ppl get tired from work, but I was going through something and I don\u2019t feel like This one time I forget should be any different from the times she forgets to do major stuff, like forgetting my graduation or taking me out of programs because she didn\u2019t believe I could do it. But I do feel a bit guilty because she has expressed work fatigue before. Am I the asshole for giving her seemingly more stress unknowingly?\n\n\nEdit: seems like y\u2019all missed the first note of my story, I said they are not punished for forgetting once in a while. But still I do get where y\u2019all are coming from. Also, not y\u2019all assuming I just don\u2019t work at all, I have other shit going on, the breakup was just a contributing factor to it.",

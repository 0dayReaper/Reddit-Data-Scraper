Sure, I still have fat to lose, but I lost about 20 cm in circumference in tje last 3 years, and maybe about 30-40 from my biggest. I'm the smallest I've been since I was 17. My mum tries to convince me I'm fatter almost every time my weight comes up. I'm heavier than my lowest, but thinner, as body measurements and clothes show. I just put on a lot of muscle because I workout a lot. She still says I'm fatter. She's also convinced I stopped working out because I don't talk much about it. I'm injured now, but i tend to workout at least 3 times a week, but 5 times a week is my preferred load. Some mums are just nutty with nuts on top.\n\nEdited typo",

So, you're NTA here.\n\nShe knows perfectly well that her clothes don't fit you anymore, she's not blind. But since society tells women, especially, that our worth is tied to our weight she probably has some self-esteem issues. I don't blame you for snapping at her but maybe now there's an opportunity for having a conversation about all of this that doesn't focus on weight or clothing sizes.\n\nBTW, if she really wants to lose weight dieting is not the best choice. It will likely backfire (weight cycling is very typical for any calorie restriction diet) and since she's about 25 years older than you what worked for you might not work for her. Health wise her weight is not the most important thing but her habits like not smoking, eating nutritious food, getting enough sleep and exercise, drinking moderately and so on. You know better than me what she can improve but I suggest she doesn't focus on weight loss but healthy habits.",

She doesn't like her weight, but doesn't want to be the only one dissatisfied with her body. As long as someone else is also fat, she's fine, because she's not the only one. \n\nI have a similar relationship with my mom and weight. She does the same thing, and tries to sabotage my diets even if unwittingly.\n\nThis is selfish, and if her bitterness about her body prevents her from being happy for her daughter finding a healthier lifestyle and want to bring you down, then she has no business being hurt if you defend yourself from this toxicity.\n\nMy suggestion, if you want to avoid conflict, is to use the rule of not talking about other people's bodies. When addressing her bad behavior, talk about your body (this doesn't fit me, this is not my size, I am not this size), and don't compare to hers.",

Based on the comment \u201cyou aren\u2019t thin like me\u201d, it sounds like there are some unhealthy beliefs about weight that you have internalized as a result of being raised in this type of environment. You will also need healthy coping methods and tools to be able to interact with those around you who prefer delusion over reality and therapy can help a lot with this. \n\nAlthough I understand your frustration after years of correcting your mother and why in present day you would tell your mother she isn\u2019t \u201cthin like you\u201d because she would tell you when you were younger that you were not thin like she was at your age, in the situation YTA. \n\nFor everything that has been happening over the past five years you are N T A but this moment of conflict is showing you areas where you can reflect on yourself and your beliefs about weight and heal as an individual.

Does she undermine your sense of self or try to dismiss your reality in favor of what she\u2019d prefer on other subjects too?

Supposedly, no matter what she ate, she always hovered around 110lbs. After she had me she put on about 100 more lbs. Growing up my parents never really paid attention to nutrition so we ate whatever and I was an overweight kid. When I was a teenager my mom and I were about the same size. Through high school and into college she would buy duplicates of what she bought clothes wise and give them to me. I would also get a lot of her clothes she didn\u2019t want anymore. As a broke college kid, I was super grateful to not have to buy clothes.\n\nI moved out, only saw my parents about once a month during college and since I started working. I lost about 50-60 lbs in my early to mid twenties when I leaned how to eat better. I\u2019m 29 now, and my mother and I haven\u2019t been the same size for at least 5 years, maybe longer. I\u2019ve tried telling her when she gives me clothes, they don\u2019t fit. We aren\u2019t the same size anymore. Again, trying to be grateful, but I can\u2019t wear them.\n\nMy mother started leaving clothes her size behind at my house like she used to do when she visited my college dorm. I either give them away or return them, sometimes giving her the money back when I see her. She asks why, I remind her they don\u2019t fit me. She insists they\u2019re the right size but she thinks I want to wear too tight of clothes instead. \n\nOn a family trip she made everyone matching t shirts. Hers was an XXL. She made mine an XXL without asking what size I wanted (would be M). In front of my family I first said, \u201cThis won\u2019t fit, do you have one my size?\u201d She replied, \u201cI know you\u2019re a little smaller now, but you can tuck it in.\u201d  A little smaller? I\u2019ve busted my ass to lose weight. I was angry. I told her, \u201cYou aren\u2019t thin like me, I haven\u2019t been overweight in a long f-ing time.\u201d\n\nWell, she lost it crying. Dad\u2019s mad, my uncle\u2019s mad, aunt won\u2019t speak to me. ATIA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No diet will make you lose a significant amount of weight in three weeks. \n\n If you are exercising for two hours a day and on a diet you can expect to lose about three pounds in three weeks. The excuse that a diet doesn\u2019t work when she a) only sticks to it for 3 weeks and b) doesn\u2019t exercise in conjunction with the diet is just as delusional as her thinking you are both the same size. \n\nI have lost 20 pounds this year, it took me six months of hard work to lose that weight. Exercise and healthy eating. Your mother has not tried to lose weight, what she has tried is manipulation. \u201cThree weeks of dieting and I still weigh the same, I\u2019m a permanent victim and improvement is hopeless.\u201d Just astonishing. Losing more than one or two pounds a week is incredibly dangerous and would only be the result of starvation, which she would know if she had done any research about losing weight or talked to a health professional.\n\nAlso keep in mind that since your mother compares you to her, and because she is a professional victim, you will never be thinner than they...even if you are the same size as Kate Moss. So don\u2019t ever pay mind to what your mother says about your weight as it will just be damaging to you.\n\nUnfortunately, your mother will likely not change and you can\u2019t change her. Try your best to accept that your mother does not have a gear capacity for reality and that she will not likely put in real work to lose weight.",

I think knowing it was harsh and accepting responsibility for that is all you need to do. She needed to hear how you really felt about your weight, she is clearly projecting. She wants to bond with you about her size. She wants to have someone who is the same size as her so she doesn\u2019t feel so crappy about her size. She doesn\u2019t have the capability to understand your struggles with being a healthy weight and wearing clothes that are smaller. It\u2019s actually got nothing to do with you, in a good way! My mum does this all the time. Tells me to diet because she feels big. Comments on me \u201clooking bigger\u201d even though she\u2019s 40kg heavier than me. Our mums needs to fix how they feel about their own weight, because their feelings are leaking out onto their own daughters. The only thing you can do now is work on your own actions and reactions, and support her in doing the same.",

You seem like a strong person. By how you\u2019ve described it, it sounds like your mother is envious of you and was happy having you be the same size as her because it made her feel better. It validated her sentiment that it\u2019s all \u201cgenetics\u201d. While it\u2019s not great to point out she\u2019s not thin, I can understand being frustrated after repeatedly telling her you\u2019re not that size anymore (especially such a drastic difference going from XXL to M). Instead, she has repeatedly ignored your accomplishment and insists you\u2019re still the same. I think it might be worth having a conversation with her and saying you\u2019re sorry for snapping at her like that but she needs to stop trying to insist that you\u2019re the same and stop trying to drag you down with her so she can feel better about herself. If she can\u2019t start to grasp this new reality it might be good to have more limited contact and not allow her to come to your place anymore so she can\u2019t leave clothes.",

And in private, not in front of other people. \n\nBut the fact is she's repeatedly ignored you when you've tried to tell her that you aren't the same size anymore. \n\nHonestly, I think the remedy here is to sincerely apologize for calling her or that way, and in front of people, because obviously, you hurt her feelings. \nBut you also need to explain that you've worked hard to lose weight, and her continually ignoringthat feels like she's invalidating your accomplishment and doesn't care. \nIs make sure to add that you live her at any weight, and it doesn't matter to you what size she is. It only matters to you what size YOU are. You know, stress that you love her no matter what, and that you're not judging her for her size or anything. Only that you wanted to lose weight yourself, FOR YOURSELF. And you want her to be happy for you and all the hard work you've put in. Coz it IS hard, really hard. Which is why you understand and don't judge her for not losing weight. And it's why you're sorry for saying what you did. \n\nThat's how is approach it anyway. \nBut no, I don't think you're an a-hole. I think you just snapped and said something kind of crappy after her repeatedly ignoring you pushed you to a crappy place. Doesn't make you an a-hole. Just makes you a human who made a mistake is all. \nAnd thankfully, I think it's a mistake you can fix",

And brace yourself because she may well be right that she CAN'T lose weight. Women of a certain age often lose whatever vestige of metabolism they had. Thanks to the menopause the body can adapt to lowering calorie intake and hold on resolutely, while simultaneously hormones leave the individual on the hunt for dopamine, most easily found in junk food.

If I didn't have it, I'd be a completely different person. I'd have an entirely different personality. The illness defines me and what I can do on a day to day basis, it defines how I live\n   \nI don't want to be shamed for having it. Pretending it doesn't exist and pretending that it doesn't have an enormous impact on my life just so that I can try to hide it because it makes people feel awkward if I tell them about it, that's much much worse.\n  \nInstead these things should be normalised. Having schizophrenia is as common as being gay is. It's a super common illness. But everyone with it has to suffer this stigma, and has to hide it from others, at least in path because of this attitude of \"it doesn't define me\" and \"I don't want labels\"\n  \nPeople shouldn't be shamed for having an illness they have no control over. That's not a good way to deal with it. It will only make people with the illness hide it away instead of seeking medical treatment for it, because of you people making it sound like it's something to be ashamed of\n  \nI'm not ashamed. No more than I'd be ashamed for having a cold. It's just an illness. It's a very common illness. And I'm not gonna try and pretend like I don't have it just cos it makes people uncomfortable right now. One day, it will be normalised. People will openly talk about it *without* this stigma of it making people feel ashamed of having it. And so far far more people who have it will go seek treatment for it. Because there won't be this stigma of having it, anymore\n  \nI'm sorry for going off like this, I don't think you're doing it maliciously, but it just really bugs me this idea like I have to pretend I don't have it and have to hide it away. Talking about it, making the symptoms more widely known, will cause many more people to get treatment for it. Pretending it doesn't exist because it's something to be ashamed of will just make people who are really suffering simply try to bottle it up until it eventually explodes and they have a nervous breakdown, and the damage will have then been done. It'll be a case of managing the symptoms from then on, there's no way to reverse it once it starts. Schizophrenia is a permanent physical change to your brain's internal structure. It literally is who you are, it defines your personality",

She's been a great employee except for this one incident, and frankly after hearing her explanation/reason, I was able to understand the severity of the situation she was in. People react to trauma differently, and I can't say for certain that I would have handled her issues any better than she's handling them.   \n\nI just wish I had known ahead of time that July 19th was a bad day for her.

I lost my mother at 29 and that was 32 years ago. I'm still not \"over it\". Someone on reddit some time back wrote a lengthy description of the grieving process. He explained it as being in a shipwreck, and clinging to pieces of the ship to hang on. As each wave hit him and the wreckage it was overwhelming, but got a little easier to endure. And that's how I felt with my mother. At first, I truly thought I wouldn't be able to go on. And some days I didn't want to. And this grief did shape my life. I went from being a child to an adult; my parachute was gone. I still had my dad, who I adored and loved, but your mom's your mom. If you've got a good one, their love is unconditional, and that's the parachute. So now, I'm my kids parachute. \n\nGrieve your own way and accept how it changes you. It sounds to me like for better or for worse, it made you a compassionate person.",

But if I had read this when my mother died, I think I would truly have been comforted. Hang in there. You will survive. I will not lie and say you will get over it, but frankly, I don't think you should. The really sucky part of losing someone that you love that much, is each time it happens, you bounce back a little faster. I'm 61. I was fortunate enough to have two grandparents into my 30's, who I was close to. Losing them hurt, not as much as my mother, but still hurt. And I lost my dad only 9 years after my mom. That also hurt, but I managed to \"get past it\", a bit easier. But I truly think it was because my mother died first. So here is the whole post:\n\nAlright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.",

We first got together when I was technically her boss, though I had already accepted a new position months before had and HR was dragging their feet to hire my replacement.\n\nFor context I had years prior worked in the warehouse as a material runner and many people had said I was one of the best they had ever seen at the job, and many liked to comment even after I moved positions that they still hadn't seen anyone as good as me. Que my replacement, who was previously working in the warehouse and had quite the complex of wanting to 'be the best.' I didn't find out until later that he was apparently jealous people talked about how good I was lol.\n\nNow, I don't brag about what I do, I believe in just getting my job done as best I can. That's probably why I made a good manager, because I just did what I needed to be done and didn't spend the whole shift talking.\n\nSo, about 5 months after I had signed papers to transfer to a new position, my replacement takes over and I finally get to move on. The guy finds out my then girlfriend, now fiance, is with me and starts harassing her constantly because he's apparently jealous that people said I was the best they had ever seen in the warehouse, and now people were saying the same to him about when I was managing the department.\n\nHe once cornered her and told her he was going to bang her mom and become her new daddy. Disgusting, right? Now, I would think this would be a firing offense, so I advocated her going to HR because he had been harassing her for 2 months or so at this point. She finally agrees to go, and theytold her they would look into it.\n\nAnother month or so goes by, with nothing done about the harassment. Then she gets a write up for apparently performing a setup procedure wrong, even though there was no documentation on the procedure and the engineer saying it was fine. Once again I advocate her going to HR to fight it.\n\nShe does so, because at this point she just wants to transfer to another department but you can't transfer with an active write up. The HR person tells her it was an absurd write up but there's nothing they can do and that she would just have to wait the 6 months for the write up to drop off before she can transfer and that they will 'talk to' her harasser again. Again, with nothing being done.\n\nI finally just told her to quit because it was talking such a mental toll she could barely sleep, and even in our days off she would just stress about having to go back. That was what opened my eyes that HR is in no way for the employees. HR is only out for the company and their buddies.",

It's a small business. I'm sure most of his team are pretty happy, and do take their paid time off regularly.\n\nIn my country we get a minimum of 4 weeks paid time off per year (legally required), but even that isn't just 'whenever you like it'. You submit your annual leave dates for approval for this exact reason - so that *if* I want to disappear for a full month, it's not at the exact same time as a bunch of other employees.\n\nYou don't disappear for months and leave your boss and team in the lurch when you work for someone like this.",

Getting up, showered, dressed, fed...that takes a few. Could even be a spoon each activity! That's four down and you've not left the house yet. Getting to work? Might take two. Got a big project on that's stressful? Four. Up to 10 and it's lunchtime. Hope you remembered it or that's an extra spoon gone! Hometime rush hour! Two more....oh wait an accident has closed the line/exit/thing...best make it three. Made it home and you've not eaten yet, you've got 3 spoons left, you've done no housework, haven't made tomorrow's lunch or had dinner!\n\nYou can push through, tired, grumbly and possibly slightly fuzzybrained, but you'll be borrowing out of tomorrows 16 spoons, and you will wake up feeling utterly crap and tomorrow might be lucky to make it to mid-afternoon before you just cannot and want to sleep under the desk.\n\n\nI'm currently running on borrowed spoons after a day out (outside! People! Doing things!), then the night at my partners, a minor meltdown because I reached the 'do not want' level of social interaction and then a two hour bus trip home with some godawful roadworks thrown in, during a heatwave. \nI miss being able to do stuff without thinking about it beforehand.\n\nTL;DR\n\nPeople who have mental health/physical health issues may find the most random things difficult to do and it makes them feel exhausted even doing something minor.",

Peter, which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to their \"maximum level of incompetence\": employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another. The concept was explained in the 1969 book The Peter Principle (William Morrow and Company) by Dr. Peter and Raymond Hull.

The major problem is that if a person is good at the job they're doing now, it does not imply that they'll be good at the next level upwards, especially if the next level upwards involves a different skill set, like being promoted from a cashier to a manager. So if a worker is good at their job, they'll move upwards, and if they're not good at their job, they won't move upwards. Instead, they'll get stuck at whatever level they got promoted to where they're NOT good at their job. If an entire organization works this way, every level of employee will be populated by people who are not good at their jobs. And given that part of some peoples' jobs is to make promotion decisions, they're liable to make bad ones if they're bad at their own jobs...\n\nTL;DR: Michael Scott was a very good salesman, so he got promoted to be the manager of the branch he worked at. He was an extremely bad manager, so he was unable to get promoted any further. His branch was weaker for this; a better company would have realized that his skills made him an excellent salesman and a terrible manager, and kept him as a salesman.",

Cost customers and other employees a lot of frustration and business potentially a lot of sales. \n* Owner reacts pretty reasonably the first time with the offer of either take termination or step down and lose pay raise. \n* Owner then apologizes? Employee gets to step down and keep raise? This part baffles me. \n\nHonestly, without knowing the details of their conversation, I would say this is the wrong outcome and the employee is taking advantage of the owner\u2019s overwhelming empathy. Would need the details of the conversation to change my mind.",

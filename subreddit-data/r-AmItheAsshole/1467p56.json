    "postText": "My partner and I have been together for six years. We come from different backgrounds so I\u2019ve learned a lot about his family traditions and vice versa. Where I\u2019m from, we don\u2019t give gifts. We celebrate by having everyone get together for a feast. However, it is very important in my partner\u2019s household that people are celebrated with gifts during birthdays and Christmas. It was uncomfortable for me to receive gifts at the start, but I am more comfortable now after 6 years.\nWhen my partner and I started dating, my partner\u2019s family all got me gifts for my birthday and Christmas. It made me feel like I was a part of the family and I was touched. I still feel that way when I receive gifts, and I am grateful that they care to get me a gift. My partner\u2019s sister (B) was one of my best friends and was no different. She met a man (N) four years ago and got married shortly after. Since then, they stopped giving me gifts. I didn\u2019t mind at first because I don\u2019t expect to always receive presents. However, as time passed I started to feel left out. During Christmas, we get together with my partner\u2019s family to open gifts together, and it makes me feel forgotten when everyone but me received gifts from B and N. I would\u2019ve been grateful no matter what was gifted. \nBoth B and N\u2019s birthdays are earlier than mine. When I don\u2019t have money, I make them things. I\u2019ve carved them wooden spoons and a napkin holder and knitted a blanket for them. It makes me happy to see that they appreciate my gifts, especially ones I made specifically for them. However, in the past couple of years that feeling is mixed with sadness, because I know they wont put in any effort for me, though I am hopeful every year. I talked to my partner about how I felt last Christmas. After Christmas, I said, \u201cCan I be honest? It makes me feel sad and left out because I am the only person that B and N don\u2019t give gifts to.\u201d He didn\u2019t realize they have not given me a gift in years and he said sorry. I told him it\u2019s not his fault, I just didn\u2019t want to hide how I was feeling. In my heart I wished he would advocate for me to his sister, but I know it can be an uncomfortable conversation so I would not ask that of him. After my birthday this year, I brought it up again because I felt unappreciated by B and N. I care for their pets for free often at short notice. I give a lot of emotional support even when I am struggling with my own health. So I was feeling very sensitive about it this year. My partner did not say a word when I told him how I felt, and it made me feel bad. His lack of response made me feel like I did something wrong. Conversations with him have been shallow and short since then. I feel guilty because I feel like I\u2019m being entitled. However, another part of of me feels like I\u2019m not being entitled because I just want to be included/appreciated. It doesn\u2019t matter what they get me. Please help, AITA for telling my partner about how I feel?",

If you're not willing to confront the issue, accept the issue- because if you keep on hinting and moaning, you'll very quickly become an AH for that.",

I feel very responsible for the people around me and have a lot of anxiety. I didn\u2019t have to carve them the spoons, and I probably won\u2019t put as much effort into that anymore since it makes me sadder later on. I don\u2019t know how to say no to watching their dogs, though. They announce they\u2019re going on a trip the day before they have to leave, and I am usually the only one available to watch them because I work from home. I love the dogs dearly, and don\u2019t want to deal with the fallout if I say no (though I am a little proud of myself to say that I have stood up for myself a couple times! This may be small for other people but it was a big victory for me). Thank you for your gentle esh, I need the push to be more direct and clear about my needs and feelings.",

The flip side of this, is that these people assume it's ok to act this way because that's the standard *you've* set.  Your partner can't change this, only you can.  **Focus on relationships with reciprocity and appreciation and you'll find it easier to people please less.**  Therapy might be very helpful to you to unravel these patterns.\n\nOnce you aren't contributing to this one-sided relationship it won't hurt as much when they exclude you.  You do have the power to say no.  Take some time to halt these patterns, and you might find out you don't need to act this way to feel good about yourself.\n\nTell them now that you can't watch the dogs anymore, certainly not last minute.  That way you won't be forced to do it when there's conveniently no one else.  If you love dogs, get a dog.  Don't get any birthday presents for them.  Stepping back when you don't receive reciprocity or appreciation is the only way to maintain healthy, loving relationships.",

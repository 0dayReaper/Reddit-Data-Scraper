    "postText": "Dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but I\u2019m struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. \n\nWe\u2019ve always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural Midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. \n\nNone of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I\u2019m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn\u2019t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it\u2019s not YOUR pan. \n\nShe asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn\u2019t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they\u2019re colored is so it helps me remember that I\u2019m not to touch them unless I\u2019m cooking vegan. \n\nThat wasn\u2019t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is \u2018contaminated\u2019 with animal product, and the fridge has \u2018bacon grease fingers\u2019 on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she\u2019s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don\u2019t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it\u2019s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. \n\nfrankly I\u2019m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife\u2019s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn\u2019t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it\u2019s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I\u2019m sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I\u2019m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",

Also, if you go to a restaurant, unless it is specifically vegan, I guarantee you they will not stop what they are doing to sterilize the kitchen to accomodate your daughter. If she has local hang out places that are food places, you need to let her know they will likely contain, egg, dairy and possibly meat products, that could include fryer grease. Oh, some bread and pastry products=butter, in case she eats that stuff.",

They basically have a broiler where you put the meat on the edge of the oven, push a handle, and it pushes the meat in on a grill-like rack where fire shoots up underneath and cooks it. The rack definitely could have some burger grease on it but it wouldn\u2019t really be enough to fry the patty in it. The Impossible patties get their own separate tray when they go to the warmer. So while it isn\u2019t fried in burger grease, it could have just a tiny bit on it. The burger patty itself is made of potato starch and soy, so it has a similar texture to meat. \n\nWe can also cook them without the broiler at all because they can be heated in the microwave. You just have to request it. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

You cook with peanut oil, get a little on your fingers, then you touch the door of the fridge before washing your hands.  You then touch the handle of the sink, and if you're one of those \"just run water over them for 5 seconds\" hand-washers you'll probably also get some peanut oil on the dish towel.  And unless you clean the sink incredibly well after you wash the pot, there's probably peanut oil there too.  Your peanut allergic roommate is gonna have a bad time.

The kids take their greasy burger hands and lend her a pen. They give her a high five with lingering chicken finger residue ready to emigrate to her hand. All this to say that she is trying to push boundaries and hold you to an untenable standard that she would never think to hold others to. You have acquiesced and adapted to her needs in a proper way and you needn't go further. Part of being a successful vegan is being adaptive to the environment you're in. She needs to learn those skills herself rather than attempt to dictate what the environment is or is not.\n\nEdited: Fixed a typo.",

And she has to understand that there's going to be meat around. I get that it upsets her, really, but unless she only lives with vegans for the rest of her life this is something she is going to have to get used to. \n\nA compromise might be too keep the meat in a drawer in the fridge rather than getting rid of it altogether. \n\nShe's young, and a new vegan, so the good news is that she will probably grow out of/ease up on it. When you first go vegan you're so excited and feel so enlightened, like no one ever figured this out before you. Then you get a little jaded and relax a bit. Try to tough it out and keep talking to her. But no, you do not need to stop making/storing meat in your house just for her.\n\nEdit: I am very clearly not talking about cross contamination when it comes to food allergies.",

But she made that decision while living in a house of meat eaters. If she wants to do the extra work of hand-washing her dishes, buy herself a special fridge, etc., sure. You've already done enough to support this, including spending more money on groceries and buying her her own pots and pans. The selfishness needs to end. There's no reason anyone should have to completely uproot their way of life because of a decision someone else made.",

Absolutely NTA, but here a few things to make this easier on all of you. \n\nOne thing I can say is maybe tell her to hand wash her stuff or you can compromise and wash your really greasy stuff before tossing it in the dishwasher. Another thing would be to allot areas for just her and her dishes/food inside the dish washer and the fridge.\n\nEdit: Also, I have bad anxiety and sometimes freak out internally about my non-vegetarian room mates/friends not washing their hands and touching the fridge/other stuff. What I do is wipe down the fridge handles and all of that jazz whenever I feel that way. It makes me feel less conscious and seriously, your daughter should start doing this if she worries that much about it. Like tell her to have her own towel/bounty sheet to wipe down the fridge handle before she uses it. It\u2019ll also teach her to be more responsible for herself.",

Combining this with the teenage propensity for taking things to the extreme, this attitude from your daughter is perfectly normal.\n\nAs to what you should do: She has her own vegan cookware. She also has access to the sink where she can hand wash anything she doesn't want \"contaminated\" by the dishwasher. You can also offer her a shelf in the refrigerator that is to be kept \"pure\".\n\nIt's interesting that she doesn't seem to be proselytizing, ie. trying to argue why you should want to be vegan, just that you are grossing her out. If you wanted, you could offer to have one night a week where she cooks the family dinner and can make it vegan. Who knows, you might end up liking some of it!\n\nEDIT: NAH",

Everything I read in this post tells me you are an amazing father.  \n\nNobody in this situation is an asshole, and you especially are being very patient and kind to your teenage daughter, and teenagers are hard. I aspire to be like you when my son reaches that age.\n\nEdit: sincerely curious why this is getting downvoted. Would someone mind explaining? If there\u2019s something obvious I missed I\u2019d like to know. All in the spirit of exchanging ideas, not to argue.\n\nEdit2: lol, also I thought this was one of my nicer comments. I can\u2019t read a crowd I guess.\n\nEdit: oh wow now I\u2019m upvoted. Ok I feel bad sorry if you upvoted me, I actually was convinced by someone who disagree with me. They pointed out that at 14, she is old enough to know that yelling and basically having a tantrum is not an appropriate way to communicate. What can I say, I have no backbone.\n\n\nEDIT: sorry I can\u2019t reply, I got permabanned for this exchange. To the troll who\u2019s goal it was to get me banned, you\u2019ve vastly overestimated the importance of AITA in my life.\n\nTo those wondering, I called a troll a dumbass. I realized later that was his goal, so he could report me the mods, because he immediately deleted his account right after.

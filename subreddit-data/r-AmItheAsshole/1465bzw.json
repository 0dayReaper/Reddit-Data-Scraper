I just don\u2019t want to bother them and I know it\u2019s too late to change anything anyway.\n\nI\u2019m kind of hiding right now, but I could just walk around the house and make it seem like I\u2019ve been in the backyard the whole time.

Your step mother completely left you out in the dark about the joint party offer and she should\u2019ve let you know that the party was only going to be for your step sister WITH an explanation, not just for you to guess why. Even though the party is not for you, you still attended and didn\u2019t take out your emotions on anyone there, which is an emotionally mature thing to do. I personally would approach the family after the party is over about how the lack of communication on your end was unfair and how it consequently made you feel down.",

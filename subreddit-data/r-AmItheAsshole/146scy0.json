    "postText": "\nMy (21) dad (55)  visited from out of state. Our relationship has been rocky and only till recenty did I realize how toxic he was.\n\nFor context, vacation/hanging out with my dad and brother (33) are stressful. They argue and rope me into it. They don't listen to what I have to say. If I zone out because I want to detach myself from the conflic, my dad will yell and further escalate. It's an uptight vacation where everyone has to eat at a specific time, where everyone hangsout with each other at a specific time and we have a curfew. My girlfriend has refused to hangout/vacation with my brother and dad because \"I'm always alert, they're nice and the next thing they're being mean/insulting/yelling/controlling.\" She said it reminded her of her dysfunctional family and would rather not deal with it. And she cautioned me to set boundaries (she doesn't stop me from hanging out with them, she doesn't want to tag along).\n\nWell, my dad was going back and my brother and him wanted me to drive.\n\nSo many times, they argue in the car while I drive and I get roped in. I've told them I'll stop and get out of the car before but they yell at me because my dad is going to miss his flight. I expressed to my girlfriend that this was bound to happen. She advised me to do it: stop the car, and just call her for a ride home.\n\nWell, it happened. They had a yelling match while\nI drove. I was getting heated. I asked 3x, \"please stop arguing its distracting, I will stop the car and get out.\"\n\nNothing happened after the 3rd time. So I pulled over at a gas station, and I called my girlfriend who gave me a ride back home.\n\nMy dad and brother were angry and the whole time trying to convince me to drive them instead of driving themselves. In the end, my dad missed his flight.\n\nThey're both furious at me and calling me an ungrateful asshole and that he missed his flight because of me. And my brother said that that wasnt the right time to \"establish boundaries\". My girlfriend said that it's their problem, and I gave them ample time to not be distracting.\n\naita?",

In other words, if he's not willing to fix the problem, then he needs to shut up about it.\n\nThese car fiascos are clearly a frequent occurrence, given that your girlfriend has finally drawn a line and refuses to go along for the ride.

It\u2019s their own fault, you told them more than enough times. They are probably used to you giving in so they\u2019re shocked that you actually didn\u2019t (at least that\u2019s what happened in my case when I started sticking to my boundaries).",

Our relationship has been rocky and only till recenty did I realize how toxic he was.\n\nFor context, vacation/hanging out with my dad and brother (33) are stressful. They argue and rope me into it. They don't listen to what I have to say. If I zone out because I want to detach myself from the conflic, my dad will yell and further escalate. It's an uptight vacation where everyone has to eat at a specific time, where everyone hangsout with each other at a specific time and we have a curfew. My girlfriend has refused to hangout/vacation with my brother and dad because \"I'm always alert, they're nice and the next thing they're being mean/insulting/yelling/controlling.\" She said it reminded her of her dysfunctional family and would rather not deal with it. And she cautioned me to set boundaries (she doesn't stop me from hanging out with them, she doesn't want to tag along).\n\nWell, my dad was going back and my brother and him wanted me to drive.\n\nSo many times, they argue in the car while I drive and I get roped in. I've told them I'll stop and get out of the car before but they yell at me because my dad is going to miss his flight. I expressed to my girlfriend that this was bound to happen. She advised me to do it: stop the car, and just call her for a ride home.\n\nWell, it happened. They had a yelling match while\nI drove. I was getting heated. I asked 3x, \"please stop arguing its distracting, I will stop the car and get out.\"\n\nNothing happened after the 3rd time. So I pulled over at a gas station, and I called my girlfriend who gave me a ride back home.\n\nMy dad and brother were angry and the whole time trying to convince me to drive them instead of driving themselves. In the end, my dad missed his flight.\n\nThey're both furious at me and calling me an ungrateful asshole and that he missed his flight because of me. And my brother said that that wasnt the right time to \"establish boundaries\". My girlfriend said that it's their problem, and I gave them ample time to not be distracting.\n\naita?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

At first I was so shocked that I didn't even reply. That's when he put his fianc\u00e9e on the phone and she said something like, \"That's my family.\" To which I responded that I didn't know what she meant. Dan came back on and said something about me being unfriendly at the bridal shower the month before.\n\nI find it very difficult to believe a single act of 'unfriendliness' could cause someone's entire family to veto the rehearsal dinner, so there has to have been something more going on that the mother was either oblivious to, or doesn't want to admit to.\n\nIt could be that the mother is a control-freak, and her daughter-in-law saw no way to get her husband out from under that control other than to cut his mother out of their life completely.\n\nOr maybe the daughter is the control freak. Cutting someone off entirely from their family ***is*** a tactic typically used by abusive spouses.",

To be married outside, you must have an appointment; it's that popular. \n\nThe wedding actually cost $100. My mom bought me a dress and my husband an amazing tie for about $200. My MIL spent about $50 on groceries to have a ton of homemade food and cake with our families (it was about a dozen people). \n\nBest decision I could have made. I don't understand why people get so hung up about weddings. The amount of money is oftentimes enough to cover the down payment on a mortgage. I've been to a decent amount of weddings, and I really only remember one having great food and a great party. Usually it's just a huge waste of money. My husband and I went to his cousin's wedding about a year before we got married. Between the shower, the gift, the hotel room, the gas (it was a 3 hour drive), etc we spent like $700. And vowed to never do it again or put anyone else in that position.",

Don't get me wrong, I loved my wedding, it was beautiful, but it wasn't worth the headache (and my wife agrees). My mother kept throwing money at it. \"Well, you HAVE to have this thing\" \"ma, I can't afford that, nor do I really care\" \"well I'll pay for it\" \"fine\". Except she kept adding shit and wasn't paying for all of it. I finally put my foot down and said \"I'm cancelling X,Y and Z. I can't afford it, and really don't care about it even if I could\". It caused tension and drama, but was the right thing. I didn't need a damn raw bar, or carving station during the cocktail hour (we had appetizers). I didn't need a DJ AND a band, I didn't need the open bar ALL night (their default was to cut off an hour before the end of the wedding, which, I actually preferred, gives people a chance to sober up a bit). I also hated the \"you HAVE to invite these people!\" \"ma, I haven't seen them in 15 years, and not like we were even close then. I wouldn't recognize them if I hit them with my car\". Good decision with that was our wedding was 250 people. My wife and I told my mother and her parents \"you get 50 people, including guests, that are your 'must invites' of the family. I don't want to hear shit about it other than that\". We also forced their hand by not including people on our list that we absolutely would have invited (like my aunt and uncle, some family friends, etc...) to make that number even smaller while we seemed to be \"reasonable\". Fuck the games, fuck the drama. Elope",

Weddings took place in the local parish and receptions in an attached party hall or even someone\u2019s home. \n\nNow, perhaps because people move farther away and more often, kids are more independent, parents already spending so much on college that they can\u2019t foot the whole bill, etc , couples are paying for their own weddings and it\u2019s morphing into a \u201cthis is our grand gala\u201d instead of a contemplation of a life together. Moms and dads want to celebrate with their friends, too. Raising kids is a long and stressful ride and marrying that child off to their forever mate signals a sense of, \u201cPhew!  We did it!  We can rest easy while they ride off into the sunset with one another to help them navigate the waters from here on.\u201d  It really does take a village. \n\nGuests are not supposed to be so grateful they were even invited that they give a gift of a value equal or greater to the cost of their dinner - the bride and groom are supposed to circulate at the reception and graciously thank the guests for sharing in their joy. Wedding parties are supposed to be made up of the loved ones who helped the little girl and little boy grow into that kind of adult that would make a loving spouse, not the \u201cpretty enough but not prettier than the bride\u201c girls that they\u2019ve known for a year or so and have to cut their hair, pay $250 for their makeup session and are rich enough to throw some destination hen party extravaganza. \n\nI vote for more elopements and more 20-year anniversary parties- where there\u2019s no question anymore if it\u2019s forever and a pretty dress that doesn\u2019t cost $20k. I know, I\u2019m kind of old and not too woke but I want my kids to know that the person they\u2019ve chosen is the person with which they dream of growing old and if it\u2019s done in a courtroom, a Vegas chapel or Westminster Abbey, that it\u2019s forever. \n\nEnd of rant - thanks if you read it :)",

Our makeup cost \u00a340 each which we paid for ourselves, she didn't hire a professional photographer, we got to choose our bridesmaid dresses together, she even let my boyfriend run off to buy a guitar after the ceremony!! Not every millennial is a total ass hat.\n\nI think tensions rise when the parents want distant relatives that the bride and groom don't know or barely know and it ends up being a wedding full of practical strangers that cost the bride and groom a lot extra to cater for. In my experience, this is the main cause of grief for the couple haha",

Millennial divorce rates are way lower than previous generations, and I've got to say most of the millennial weddings I've attended have had a wonderful feel of a bunch of people coming together to celebrate the couple, celebrate each other, celebrate all of our long relationships together. The weddings are lovely, but also fairly low on frills. They feel much more relaxed and comfortable than weddings even just a decade ago.\n\nOne of my friends is an executive at Google in NYC, his wedding was in a tent on his mom's farm in Ontario. Another pair of my friends are both law professors, their wedding was in one of the beautiful halls in the University they went to. Another friend of mine did his in an art gallery out in the countryside.\n\nIt's all such a refreshing change from the tuxedos, banquet halls, and divorce rates that I used to see in the 90's.",

I\u2019ve heard a lot of people over the years expressing dismay that they didn\u2019t know people who attended their wedding, and I listen sympathetically. But really, how could it be possible for both partners to know every guest? There were people at my wedding whom my husband knew and whom I didn\u2019t, and vice versa. And that was fine\u2014we knew a lot of people before we met each other.\n\nBy extension, wedding guest lists can include people who are important to the couple\u2019s parents. Why shouldn\u2019t my MIL get to invite her best friend, to share this important occasion with her? Obviously things are different when there\u2019s estrangement or conflict, and clearly everyone can\u2019t get a say in the guest list. But when this isn\u2019t the case, I think it makes sense that weddings might include people important to each partner in the couple, as well as some people important to their families or even communities.\n\nETA judgment: NTA because no one should feel like family members are manipulating them re. their wedding.",

Holy crap, no. I can\u2019t even imagine this being ok if one person paid for the whole wedding - Uncle Goober donating $100 and then demanding his daughter get to be the flower girl or his son be promoted to groomsman is just beyond the pale insane. \n\nI\u2019d assume they probably would have honored the invite MIL\u2019s bestie Nadine type demands if that was all people wanted but when it got out of hand, they didn\u2019t have much choice but to shut the whole thing down. Choosing some people\u2019s requests to honor and not others would have been even worse from a drama standpoint. \n\nNTA, obvs. My own wedding, my wife and I paid for but her family helped with cooking, flowers and decorations. They are known for being in everyone\u2019s business so I was anticipating a nightmare but it actually wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I did have to shut down a few instances of overstepping and my wife was so stressed she suggested eloping a bunch the final week before our wedding.

The average wedding cost (this was as of 2017 I believe) was around $33,000. And around half of that is for venue and food/drink costs. You have to pay per person for food and drinks. So maybe you\u2019ve decided on inviting 75 people but your mom wants to invite your old babysitter, and your aunt wants to invite her church friend, and your cousin wants to invite her sorority sister or whoever. It racks up so fast and the biggest contributor to that is the guest list. This is why couples are choosing to cut that down and have a more intimate experience. Maybe back in the day when weddings were held at the local chapel and receptions in the town community center this was fine, but that\u2019s just not reality anymore. When I get married, I want only the people I and my partner are closest with. I don\u2019t want a bunch of people I\u2019ve never met or only saw once when I was 6.",

And gifts certainly shouldn't come with stipulations. So we're on the same page with much of the main issue here.\n\nWhere my opinion differs from most people here is that I think the message comes off as an immature attempt at being pompous. It reads like a kid trying to act in a way that they view as mature.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with simply returning the money to the people who gave it, thanking them, and explaining that you simply don't want that type of wedding. A message like the one you sent kind of puts everyone on blast, and I really, really doubt that every single person who gave or offered money did so with the same exact intentions.\n\nI can't imagine there was such a large amount of people who wanted to offer you money that you couldn't address them all individually. I guess I just have a difficult time believing that you had a large number of people all offer you money towards your wedding while expecting to make decisions in return, and that all of these people did so with selfish intentions.\n\nIf that IS the case, than damn, you got some family. But realistically, I feel like there are a couple of people here who genuinely love you, wanted to help you and only tried to involve themselves because they legitimately felt it would help you and your spouse have a better wedding. I believe those people deserved a personal conversation where you thank them for their contribution but decline it.\n\nMaybe that's just me though. I defintely don't think you're the asshole overall, just maybe mildly harsh in your handling of it.\n\nEither way, good luck/congrats on your wedding, I hope everything works out for you and your spouse.",

Just...I assume you're going to have to deal with these relatives for the rest of your or their lives, on some level. \n\nExercising a bit more self-restraint in how you communicate will make your life easier in the long run.

Do you know if your relatives were intentionally trying to leverage gifts for a say in your plans? Are you sure *all* of them were guilty of this? Your implication of their duplicity could have rubbed innocent relatives the wrong way. Furthermore, returning a gift can be seen as a rude gesture.\n\nIn many cultures, extended families are very involved and can be unnecessarily overbearing without intending too. I believe it is better to extend them the courtesy of ignorance first, before assuming malice. You could have:\n\n  a. Simply been firm in your plans. Respectfully acknowledge suggestions but explain your preferences. You have no obligation to return a gift. If someone asked for theirs back - you'd have concrete proof of their intention.\n\n  b. Explained your reasons for returning all gifts more diplomatically. Your response is dripping with sanctimony. You didn't have to enunciate why you are in the right - doesn't gain you anything extra.

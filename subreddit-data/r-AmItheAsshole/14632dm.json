Completely valid if when you go see your dad, you want to spend time with him and feel wanted when you are there.  He needs to make time for you.  Good job for standing up for yourself.\n\nI hope he comes around and realizes who is important in his life.",

Sure, he might be \u201cgoing through personal things\u201d but you have the right to an environment where you feel comfortable and a relationship where there is respect, love, and consideration. He needs to grow up/get therapy and get his life and priorities straight \u2014 and that isn\u2019t on you. Block the haters and focus on doing well in school.",

He gets mad, tries blaming your mother. You explain the real reason. He blows up at you.  He and his relatives need to bug off and leave you be. They are the AT's, not you.",

The only thing I would say is make sure you are doing what you want to do and take a few days to think it over.\n\nWhen are parents die they are gone forever and you may regret your decision. I am not for one moment saying he should be allowed to pick you up and drop you like a stone when he wants, I am just saying make sure it\u2019s a decision you can live with. \n\nBut if he sounds like your post says, then he needs to step up as a man with responsibilities.",

I regret the extra years I subjected myself to a toxic parent.   I regret that he wasn\u2019t the dad I deserved. \n\nI\u2019m relieved I didn\u2019t subject myself to the added trauma of seeing him on his deathbed, or of attending his wake snd funeral. A funeral where apparently everyone lied about what a GREAT guy he was (people couldn\u2019t stand him - with reason).  A funeral where I would have been pressured into saying lies about what a good dad he was, when the only nice thing I can honestly say about him is that he never sexually abused me.",

    "postText": "Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/h7k8dj/wibta\\_by\\_not\\_telling\\_a\\_guy\\_ive\\_been\\_dating\\_for\\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/h7k8dj/wibta_by_not_telling_a_guy_ive_been_dating_for_a/)\n\nA month ago I asked if I WBTA for not telling a guy I had only started dating that I had plans to become a single mother. I was scared I'd lose him but also felt I would be deceiving him by not telling him, thus making the investment in our relationship unfair. The comments were pretty much unanimous in that I'm an asshole, and I needed to tell him, and this validated my decision to go forth and be honest, as nervous as I was.\n\nI explained my situation about taking 2 yrs to come to this decision, how my fertility clinic had shut due to Covid which was why I had gone back onto dating apps. I explained how my clinic had reopened after meeting him, and how important it was to me to continue in my journey to become a mother. I knew this was 'baggage' he hadn't expected and that there was every chance he would step away from the situation. Well, he didn't.\n\nWe're now in a committed relationship and he's been supporting me in my journey. I've had 2 unsuccessful artificial inseminations with donor sperm (my original plan), and we've spoken about having a child together. As early on as it may seem, he told me my honesty made him consider his own future and how he really wants a family some day, and how he has admiration for me being honest about my situation and how he wants to help my fulfil my desires to be a mother, whether with him or with donor sperm - either way he wants to be a part of my life.\n\nI wanted to provide this update as a positive outcome has come out of being labelled an asshole and it pushed me to do the right thing, which has in turn meant I have the most understanding and accepting bf. Had I kept this info from him it would have played on my conscience, as well as most likely have caused him to not trust me. So thank you : )  \n\n\nEDIT - Gosh, I didn't think this post would blow up in this way. Thanks for the lovely words of support, and also those of you taking the time to provide food for thought of co-parenting and step-parenting. This is new territory for me, and I don't know anyone else in my day to day life who has been in this situation, so it's so valuable for me to hear your views and gain new perspectives. Thank you, kind Reddit community.",

If you go the old-fashioned way, it's legally as much his child as it is yours. I understand that you're eager to have a child, but please don't rush into anything until you're 100% sure.\n\nBest of luck to you both.",

I plan to continue with my final round before making a decision about the future. This could mean IVF (higher success rate and almost the same cost as IUI which is less invasive but less successful), or thinking about parenthood with this man. The latter will involve much more consideration as it's a big investment.  Using donor sperm means I am the only legal guardian, but doing it with someone naturally means they have every right to the child as i do. In other words - I agree with you.\n\nEDIT - Imminent parenthood with this man\\* Either from the start, or if not now, then down the line once i know him even better.",

How is it any different from any other couple that chooses to adopt, or use a donor egg or speak for infertility reasons? If the relationship lasts and he wants a family, this can be \u201chis\u201d child.",

I'm not in a relationship but if someone had come along while I was already in the process of doing fertility treatment, I wouldn't let that stop me.  It took years of budgeting and planning and months of doctors appointments before even that first fertility treatment, and as many people have said here, it's very iffy to plan to have a child with someone you just met.  Putting your plans on hold for a new person you just met can push your whole timeline back by years if you wait for things to get serious enough to have children together.",

But what I'm saying is that just because the dude is offering his donation, it doesn't mean he's forcing that decision on her. She brought it up to him, and he seemed to be ok with either option. She could go with a donor and have sole rights to the child and from what OP said, he wouldn't mind. I see nothing wrong with discussing long-term goals with a potential long-term partner early on, especially if it affects both parties so seriously. Get it out of the way now, so there's no room for misunderstanding intentions.",

I\u2019m in a blended family and I\u2019m happy, but my life would definitely be simpler if we weren\u2019t. It can get really frustrating to have two different households involved in raising your kids. You may do bedtime at 9PM but the other house lets them stay up late so they fight you all week during your week. Or you may try to cut out sugar but the other house doesn\u2019t have a problem with it. Or you might have rules about electronics and the kids tell you they don\u2019t want to live with you anymore because the other house lets them be on their phone all day. Same thing with chores, grades, homework, etc. You might think you\u2019re on the same page with someone with parenting, but there\u2019s a million little things that go into it that no one thinks about. Like you might agree on the big things like religion and discipline, but what do you do when one parent wants to home school during COVID, for example, and the other either can\u2019t or won\u2019t?  There are so many things you can\u2019t anticipate that become a huge headache when you coparent even under the best of circumstances. We do our best and even have an amicable relationship with the other parent but it\u2019s still not ideal.  \n\nIt\u2019s also hard on the kids to be shuffled from house to house. Kids get really frustrated if they accidentally leave their favorite game or shoes at one house, and we\u2019ve had a lot of meltdowns over things like that. We try to make it easier on them but you can tell it frustrates them.",

Is he on top of daily chores?\n\nMy friends situation is she was thinking about IVF, started seeing this guy for a couple months, broke up and ended up finding out she was pregnant with his kid after.  But the reasons they broke up were things that would have made him a unsuitable father (not being able to handle high stress situations or handling criticism well).\n\nAsk friends/reddit/ people who respect who are parents what makes a successful coparent, and think critically about who you are.\n\n\nYou may also want to start couples counseling preliminarily.  Not necessarily because you have problems, but this is tricky uncharted territory and you want to prevent them.\n\nIf counseling at three months in seems like too much, then having a kid definitely is.",

She was probably looking for a casual and ended up finding someone she fell in love. It would be hard for her to wait a couple of years to have a child with this guy (which might not happen) so i get why she continued with the process. \n\nI also get what you mean. Maybe he is infatuated and isn't thinking clearly about what it would mean to have a child with a woman you met a couple of months ago. She's 36 so i guess he's around that age or maybe even older so you need to trust his ability to make a responsible decision. Maybe he wants to be a parent too and even if their relationship doesn't work out they can raise a child together. He probably likes her qualities and feels like this is a good chance to become a father.",

While we were off for a few months, I decided it was time for me to try for a baby and I had a male friend who wanted to be a father. So we were still in the discussion stage of how everything would work out since we were not in a romantic relationship, when I hear from my ex. At this point I thought we were over and done with. Once I told him my plans, he was dead set against me having a baby period. Since we were about the same age, his reasoning was we were told old to consider it even though I wasn\u2019t asking him to be the father. FYI we were 39 and 40. I told him my reasons for not having a baby sooner and how I was going to try anyways, so that he was free to walk away. He did. Haven\u2019t heard from him since. While I didn\u2019t have the best of luck in getting pregnant (still no babies unfortunately), I realize I\u2019m better without my ex.

If I were comfortably earning about $100k per year, I think it would be easier, as I'd be able to afford a nanny and tutor now that kids are learning online only and I'm working 6 hour days. It's very challenging, and I'm always aware that life could be less stressful with a partner.",

If too personal sorry in advance. I would assume so that you don't want to accidentally get pregnant by your male friend (bf might be too early) the relationship can't move to that level?",

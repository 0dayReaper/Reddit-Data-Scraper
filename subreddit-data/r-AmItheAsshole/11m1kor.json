She's 6 years old, and you've made a commitment to be in her life. The moment you make it official revolves around her as much as it does you.\n\nYou absolutely have every right to honor the stepdaughter over the niece, and these first moments as stepmom are going to cause the ripple that forms the pond that is your relationship for her whole life.\n\nTrust me, if you back down now, and give her spot away, it's going to ruin more than just your wedding.\n\nETA thanks for all the upvotes!! I never expected all that \ud83e\udd70\n\nOmg thank you for the awards!!!!  \ud83e\udd29",

Kids age fast at that age and sure, she might be precocious and on top of things, and know which way to move etc. Which I doubt because SIL asked for her to be carried. Point is, there's potential for it to turn into a big mess.\n\nBut eh, none of that matters anyway. Just some additional nuance. Obviously an immediate family member trumps a niece. NTA\n\nEdit. I absolutely love all the stories. Especially the \"cranky baby yeets petals\" stories. I would totally have a ragebaby pic on my wall purely for the aesthetic lol",

She was so excited she skipped her nap the day of the wedding. By the time the wedding started (late afternoon), she was overtired and in a terrible mood. She decided she didn\u2019t want to walk down the aisle and was in a temper at the back of the church refusing to go. My husband managed to convince her to go through with it and she did but she glowered the whole way down the aisle. We have pictures of her glaring as she forcefully threw flowers in the aisle while walking to the front (it was actually kind of funny in hindsight, not so great in the moment). Anyhow, she was definitely a bit young for the job.",

She did great walking down the aisle... toss petals, toss petals, dump the basket of petals out &amp; moved nicely up the rest of the way. So, she's standing up at the front quietly but she was supposed to come sit down because no doubt in our minds that a three year olds going to need to be done. No amount of gesturing or whispering could get her to come sit. But somehow she decided she was supposed to stay up there. After a few minutes she sat down next to the bride and then a few minutes after that she laid down and fell asleep. All without a single peep. We let her nap til the ceremony was over... it went so much better than I was expecting she was always so cranky if she got tired but not this time. I've always seen it as a win.\n\nOP is NTA. As others have said sticking to your guns and keeping your word with your stepdaughter is the right thing to do. This could affect how y'all interact for the rest of your life. And if you made her give up her spot it would definitely affect how y'all interact with each other.",

SIL seems absolutely like a person who might decide to just have a \"little talk\" with her and  put a pressure on a child.\n\nAlso talk with your mother. I dont know from where did she get the notion that 6yo are that logical and understanding, especially since apparantly her own son and dil who  are over 30 are none of those things.\n\nThis is the moment you truly become a family. You don't want your first act as her step mom to be remembered as betrayal. You may not be her bio mom or even a mom figure in her life (maybe bio mom won't be ok with it, i dunno), but you must be an adult who will always be in her corner, someone she can count on to keep their promise. Caving on this will be nothing less then self sabotage.\n\nEdit: have a talk with your mom about how she sees your step children and their role in your extended family. Will they be allowed to call her grandma, is she going to overtly favour bio grandchildren over them, is she going to favour miracle baby over all other grandchildren. You need to know that now, so as to limit possible exposure and future damage.",

You\u2019re doing a great job in standing up for your stepdaughter. She\u2019ll appreciate your support. And although no one else will recognize it at this time you\u2019re also doing your niece a favor. Maybe your brother &amp; SIL will stop treating her like the second coming of the Christ child &amp; reign in the entitlement before the real world teaches her a painful lesson. Her peers will make sure of that.",

She actually suggested that this child deserved to be a (if not the) person of honour on your special day . . . several years after her birth.\n\nI mean, how many years does she intend to keep this up for? How many years does she intend to spend insisting that other people \"honour\" her child at THEIR occasions, in place of themselves and their own immediate family members?\n\nIt's not just that it's obnoxious, it's genuinely unhealthy for this poor kid. She's being put on a pedestal and taught that she is different from and above all not just other children but literally everyone else from her life. They're basically worshipping her. \n\nAnd it's not that I don't get it. Aside from siblings who struggled with infertility I have a very, very close friend whose infertility battle meant that he and his wife were married *nearly twenty years* before they were able to have a beautiful, healthy, bio child of their own. Can you imagine? Almost two decades. Theirs was a miracle in the truest sense. And yet, do you know what they DON'T do? Ask other people to worship their kid or place them at the centre of their own special occasions. In fact, they're thrilled to pieces just to hear that people love their kid and think they're doing a good job as parents. That's enough for them, the gift of being parents after all this time, and to see people love their sweet, well-mannered child. \n\nYou are NTA, but OMG your SIL is doing that kid a disservice. Your response is completely appropriate. Your wedding is not the place to \"honour\" someone else's 2-year-old. Not even a beloved rainbow-baby niece.",

I'm sure their daughter is great and they think the world of her, it has NOTHING to do with your wedding. For them to even suggest your stepdaughter - a person who is part of your immediate family and who is profoundly involved in your whole marriage - is at all inferior to your niece is, to put it nicely, idiotic and offensive.\n\nYour mom is also a major asshole - she's not staying neutral at all, she's actually trying to justify your asshole brother/SIL's demands. That's awful.\n\nI would probably give them one more chance to drop this completely and accept your decisions about your wedding and show you basic respect. If they are unable or unwilling to do that, I would tell them in some very impolite words just how important they are to the wedding (which is to say, they are not important at all) and how their absence is going to be the only wedding gift you'll accept from them.",

You are starting your new family and you have to put that immediate family ahead of the extended family, and show the step daughter that she is important to you by having her as your flower girl.\n\nYou could also say that your SIL doesn't love your daughter, just as she is saying that you do not love your niece.\n\nAnd I'm sorry, but I do not understand how any explanation could be given  to a 6 year old for why the niece needs to be the flower girl past the fact that the SIL is an overbearing AH and you need to do this to get her to shut up.  :-0",

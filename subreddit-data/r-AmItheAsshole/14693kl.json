You could say the common factor is me, but I don\u2019t think it was. My biggest beef with my dad and his wife is that they both treated me like my opinion on things, even if they deeply affected me, doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019ve always done things and made decisions without asking me or even telling me.\n\nMany years ago, my dad approached my brother and I and asked us if we\u2019d be executors for his and his wife\u2019s estates. We said yes and he gave us current wills and powers of attorney.\n\n(Another irrelevant aside: both my dad and my step mother love my ex-wife more than they love me, so the estate is being split into equal parts between me, my brother, my 2 kids, his two kids, and my ex-wife.)\n\nFlash forward to his death, and I arrive on scene thinking I\u2019m going to have to do executor stuff, only to find out my brother has a newer copy of the will and his wife\u2019s brother had an even newer version of the will where he (Des) is now executor. Fine, I thought, I didn\u2019t want to do it anyway. I shredded my paper copies of the wills and POAs and deleted them off my hard drive and cloud backup.\n\nSometime in the intervening years, Des has decided he doesn\u2019t want to do it any more. I hear through the grapevine that now my ex-wife has an even newer version of the will, that names me and my brother as co-executors again. I fruitlessly wait to see if anybody is going to bother asking me if that\u2019s ok.\n\nShe died yesterday. I told my daughters (who love the second wife dearly) and ex-wife and brother that as far as I\u2019m concerned, nobody bothered to ask me if I wanted to co-executor, so I\u2019m not going to do it. I\u2019ve put up with this bullshit for 62 years and it ends as of yesterday. They\u2019re making me feel like an asshole for not wanting to do the job, considering although I live across an international border from the corpse, I live several thousand miles and 3 time zones closer than my brother.",

After he died, it was a HUGE amount of work and a couple of years before everything was taken care of. It's a massive task for anyone to do, even if they had a good relationship with the deceased.\n\nIt's also shitty they'd change the will to add you back into the will without your consent. Hell I'm not sure that's even legal. You may be on the paperwork, but I don't see how they can make you do anything.",

Although, I suppose that's not really relevant. But you're not the asshole if you're simply looking out for your own mental health.

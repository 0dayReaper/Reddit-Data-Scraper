    "postText": "I (18 F) have always disliked my first name, religion aside. For years, I have been going by a nickname. This would be fine enough, but once people find out my legal name (eg, transport cards/IDs), it's like they completely forget the nickname. People who have known me all my life still call me my legal name at times, because they're \"used to seeing it on paper\".  \nIt is the name of an old English town. Not terrible, but almost sounds like a fantasy-royal book character name.  \nMy parents got married in said town, and have been in a toxic and emotionally abusive process of divorce for two years. Naturally, my name does remind me of that.  \nThis links into my middle name - just my father's name, and as he has been abusive, it simply has to go, to help me move on.  \nIt is not suited for an adult woman. A few people have said they like my name, but more for a baby.  \nIt just does not fit me, and I do not like the sound of the name itself. I see my name on papers, I hear it being called, and all I can think is how much I dislike it.  \nI feel like I should be able to go through life liking my own name, and not having to frantically hide IDs and change schooling registers and convince people to call me something different.  \nI always planned to change it once I turned 18, to my nickname.  \nLast year, I became religious. So, I figured, why not change my first name to a name that holds religious significance as well?  \nI want to change it before going to university, so that people will not be aware of my old name. Therefore I plan to apply for the change next month.  \nI haven't mentioned it to any family except my mother, as our relationship is closer due to everything that has gone on.  \nShe is NOT happy with the idea. She immediately shuts down the conversation.  \nHer problem is not with the actual name I've chosen, as I haven't told her it. Even changing it to my nickname, she is against. It is just the thought of change itself.  \nShe says I will be \"permanently damaging her well beyond repair\".  \nI do understand that it would be hurtful if your child does not like the name you picked.  \nI did offer to put my first name as my new middle name. I also told her I of course wouldn't be forcing any family to call me anything different - the change would be on paper, for new people only.  \nShe angrily told me that most people hate their names, but don't go to the \"extreme\" of changing them, and that something was \"abnormal\" and \"crazy\" with me.  \nI asked her if I would still be her daughter, and she said I would be the daughter who disrespected and spitefully hurt her on purpose.  \nI don't know whether this implies she wouldn't disown me, or she would (I am an only child).  \nA secondary worry is this affecting me going to university, although I have heard people who make it to university without parental support.  \nI am afraid of being TA for not respecting her wishes, as she has been a good mother otherwise, but I also can't take the feeling of hatred of my name.  \nAdvice would be very much appreciated.",

A different shirt underneath clearly states you're not wearing the same dirty outfit day after day. \n\nGood pants are hard to find! No one would bat an eye if you wore the same pair of jeans repeatedly...\n\nI ALWAYS compliment anyone I see out and about rocking them. Overalls for the win!",

I (17f) was wondering if it\u2019s weird to other people if you wear the same outfit or piece of clothing a lot? \n\nOf course I wash my clothing after every day. My mother and I got into an argument because I\u2019ve been wearing the same pair of overalls (of course I wash them after each use). \n\nShe got angry at me saying that I\u2019m \u201ctarnishing her reputation and making her look like a bad parent.\u201d But I don\u2019t think it should matter as long as I\u2019m comfortable? \n\nBtw I buy my own clothes because she buys me clothes that I always feel uncomfortable in.\n\nI\u2019m wearing a different shirt with them every time too so it\u2019s not that noticeable? I just need some advice because my mom told me that \u201cI\u2019m not going to get anywhere in life\u201d just because I like my comfy overalls :(\n\nI feel like as long as they are clean then it\u2019s ok? Besides I feel as if anyone had an actual issue with it they\u2019d come up and tell/ask me personally\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

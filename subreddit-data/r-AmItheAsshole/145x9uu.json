Then Kokaina by dj vodka started playing and my gf told one of her friends that she wanted to try something like this. Today i confronted her about this and told her she will not try any heavy drugs. She told that she always wanted to try out some drugs and that it was one of dreams. Im extremely afraid of drugs because my uncle overdosed himself on heroin. Am I the asshole in this situation?\n\n\nUpdate: \nWe broke up. We had a long talk today about some things and realised it's just not gonna work out.

No big deal. Every weekend? Danger, slow down. Every day? Addict.\n\nAll that aside NAH, you don't like drugs or even the idea of them. There's nothing wrong with drawing a line in the sand, but controlling another person's actions can be, even if you think it's for their benefit.\n\nI'd just wait and see what she does.

Most young people are curious about drugs. Most young people try drugs at some point or another. Trying drugs or wanting to try drugs is not the same as overdosing.

It's ultimately not his call though and after expressing their feelings and concerns things will be what they are.  If that is a deal breaker for them, fair enough.  I can understand why and how that past experience with uncle shaped them doesn't make them an AH.\n\nFrom the GF perspective, it is pretty normal at that age to be interested in such things and many people often do experiment, especially in college settings where substances are often more readily available. Also, given the ages here this isn't likely to be a forever relationship. It could be the case the life paths and interests are diverging here which is normal and OK.  Doesn't mean it doesn't suck to go through it, but it is a common part of life.\n\nThink I talked myself into an NAH.",

You can\u2019t forbid her to do anything, she doesn\u2019t need your permission either. \n\nBut you can and SHOULD state your boundaries. i.e. \u2018taking drugs is a deal-breaker for me. I wouldn\u2019t want to be with somebody who did this\u2019. And you can choose whether or not to explain your strong feelings. You are absolutely not the asshole for having those feelings though.",

You didn\u2019t bring up concerns or tell her about your fears, no you commanded her. Like you\u2019re allowed to command her or something. How controlling. \n\nLike, I get your opposition and I\u2019m sorry about your uncle, but you\u2019re listening to a song with a lyric that conflates doing cocaine with the actual feeling of love. What a mixed message.",

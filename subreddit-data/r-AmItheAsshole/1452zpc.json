    "postText": "So I have this friend who has been being weird towards me since I graduated with my Bachelor\u2019s degree. She told me I am a \u201chave\u201d now and I can finally get a job in my career field even though I already have a job in my career field. \n\nYesterday we had a little get together for my daughter\u2019s 5th grade promotion. I invited this friend, we will call her Cindy, and her son. Everyone was having a good time and we were sitting on the couch talking. She brings up the reality show college hill and focuses on the fact that Joseline from the show told Amber Rose that she was trying to be white. I already have contention with her about race because she likes to say how black women are so ghetto and she his not a black woman because she is Haitian. Along with some other things that are racially insensitive things she has said. She is currently married to a white man and has a mixed son, because of this she has approached adults that appear to be mixed to question their racial identity. She has also told them that they have to identify as both races because of how she feels, I think people know who they are and should be able to identify however they want to. So we are talking about the reality show and I\u2019m giving my opinion and Cindy says to me you are too invested in this, your being too emotional. Than she turns to her ten year son, who is sitting between us, and says I know right. I was baffled, so I said ok emotions turned off and I looked at her. She laughs and says omg, further frustrating me. I responded to her laughter with I don\u2019t think anything is funny. So she stands up and say oh nah, I\u2019m leaving, to which I stand up too walk to my front door and open it for her. She leaves and has not responded to my text asking if she made it home safely. Then she proceeds to unfollow me on instagram and remove me as a follower, which makes me think she has blocked me on her cell phone. Ai I the asshole for opening the door when she said she was leaving. I feel like the conversation escalated unnecessarily and her and I could have just talked it through.",

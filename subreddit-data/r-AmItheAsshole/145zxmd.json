    "postText": "I'm a happily married gay man and, yesterday I and my husband were at a friend's house celebrating their birthday. At the end of the party a small group of people were sitting around the fire talking shit when a woman ,who I don't know (friend of friend type of thing) asked me and my husband straight to our faces \"so do you like being fucked up the ass or is it your husband?\" And before you all ask no she wasn't drunk she was the designated driver  I replied \"do you like to fuck on all fours or on you're back?\" She got mad and stormed off calling me a prick. At the time everyone there laughed (most were drunk) but the woman was my friend girlfriends relative of something and, now he and his girlfriend are getting some backlash. He's mad at me now because even though what she said was offensive I didn't need to stoop to her level. I'm starting to feel bad about, the last thing I wanted was to cause trouble for my friend\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdited husband not house autocorrect",

I never really thought about it until now, but I don't think I've ever heard anyone ask that question to my married straight friends?\n\nFor some reason a lot of people just think any kind of non-cishet relationship is inherently sexual. Also explains why people keep complaining about a gay couple on TV being \"shoving it down our throats\" but the countless of hetero couples are a-okay to show in children's movies and shows. It sucks.",

I\u2019m not ruling out getting married but statistically as a never married and pushing 60 woman, it\u2019s probably not going to happen.  \n\nI get asked a lot about why I didn\u2019t get married, didn\u2019t have kids.   \n\nYet so many people end up divorced or in poverty or about to break mentally because a spouse isn\u2019t pulling their fair share financially or labor wise.  Sometimes both.   Or they get dumped after sacrificing to raise kids (occasionally happens to men too if they are caregivers).   \n\nI wouldn\u2019t ask them about it because that would be rude and inappropriate.  But maybe they need the worry and concern more than I do?",

Which *is* often the case but non cis-het are typically much more free to switch. But they feel the need to have someone they can address as the dominant/masculine person in the duo because of how subconsciously need to give a certain amount of respect to the person filling the more traditional role for their gender.",

They fixate on the \"sexual\" part of the descriptor in a way they don't heterosexual. In large part because they never think \"heterosexual\", they think \"normal\" or \"straight\". It never occurs to them that being gay means feeling the same feelings of romantic love for their partners that straight people feel for their own.\n\nAs for \"top and bottom\", I blame that entirely on the fetishization of gay and bi relationships by straight people in niche online communities spilling over into the public via social media.",

We need to talk about this more so these women realize how unbelievably rude and intrusive this is. Or when civilians ask veterans if they\u2019ve ever killed someone. Again, what a stupid, intrusive question. \n\nWe get the offensive invasion when it comes to our younger daughter because she is another race and clearly adopted. Most of these comments come down to either 1)talking as though we went to an orphanage and bought her like she\u2019s an item in a store or 2)talking as though we were part of the white savior/adoption tourism movements. None of this is accurate.\n\nAs I think of more examples, I think the moral of this story is people need to learn to keep their hands to themselves and mind their own damn business.",

When I was a teenager, and family knew, a family friend asked me a similar inappropriate question (but regarding oral sex on women, since I'm female). My aunt stepped in and said, \"Why is it you people always ask gay people and lesbians questions like that? You sexualize the hell out of them in a way you don't sexualize straight people. It's like straight is the default, and having thought about your sexuality to realize it's different means you're automatically *more* sexual than people who are the \"default\" straight. Like straight people don't think about sex?\"\n\nI'm paraphrasing a bit, but the gist is the same: because we *thought* about our sexuality to realize it's \"different,\" it must mean we're more sexual than those who never had to think about it; they're just the default, \"normal\" straight. I've always remembered that.",

A coworker of mine was once talking about a celebrity gay couple, and speculated on which one was \u201cthe wife\u201d (referring to their roles in their marriage, not their sex lives, I think - she\u2019s not usually the type that would talk about that at work). My boss and I just looked at each other, and then I told her, \u201cActually, they\u2019re both \u201cthe husband.\u201d That\u2019s kind of the point!\u201d\n\nShe just looked shocked for a while, as if that thought had *literally never crossed her mind before.* Like, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s anti-marriage equality, but it shook her entire worldview that a marriage between two men wouldn\u2019t follow traditional gender roles, with one guy taking on what she sees as the wife\u2019s role automatically (completely ignoring that a lot of hetero marriages don\u2019t follow those roles, either!). \n\nHeteronormativity is a hell of a drug. Add that to the weird ideas a lot of people have about gay men\u2019s sex lives, and they lose all sense of restraint and common decency about what you\u2019re allowed to ask a stranger.",

What made you remotely think that is an acceptable question? Are you homophobic? No? Would you ask a straight couple about their sex positions? Why would you ask a gay man, if not homophobia? What is wrong with you? What was even the purpose of that?\"\n\nWorks with sexist and racist comments, too. Once they get confronted on the why, the people making rude comments or asking rude questions or making rude 'jokes' get *real* upset.\n\nIf someone is just purely this rude, be a confrontational dick right back. Embarrass them in front of their peers. *Make* them confront that is unacceptable behavior.\n\nIt's not a little rude. Like, you're at a dinner party, and someone asks what you do and asks you what that pays, because they thought about getting into that field. You don't want to answer the salary range in front of peers. Maybe you know you make grossly over, or a little under to break in. It's a passion and not financial.\n\nThis is beyond mildly inconsiderate, or even just inconsiderate.\n\nConfront the bullshit. Belittle them.",

    "postText": "My boyfriend had to go to the ER after a accident, and he got a truly ridiculous bill back. I offered to fight the bill for her because I've done it before, and he said sure. \n\nI went all-out, because honestly if we were out 5 grand, after insurance, that would fuck up our holiday plans pretty bad. \n\nSo I...\n\n- had him call the hospital and authorize me to handle his bill and access his medical records. \n\n- got an itemized bill and compared the prices for each code to the fair prices\n\n- called billing to dispute the bill, but was told that billing only collects bills, I'd need to contact admin to dispute\n\n- bounced around a call center for hours trying to get someone who was actually qualified for bill disputes, and getting nowhere \n\n- google and linkedin searched for the hospital board of directors and upper management \n\n- got 30 emails of the most influential people at the hospital, plus the hospital's investors\n\n- every day would send a few emails, working my way up the chain, and writing an (increasingly long) email describing how they billed my \"client\" at 7 times over the fair price for services rendered, and how their billing department, customer service department, and the growing list of management I'd emailed, had failed to address the issue. \n\n- escalated the emails until I was writing the director-level staff with the entire board of directors and a number of outside investors CC'd, asking for a written statement regarding their justification for billing at a rate 7 times higher than the national average, for commensurate services to what is available at other hospitals. And sternly laying out the failures to appropriately respond, at every level of the company. \n\nWell, once I'd done all that (which was honestly only like 15 minutes a day) they reduced the bill... From $5000 to $26. Yep, twenty-six fuckin dollars. \n\nWell, I told my boyfriend the good news, and he was at first overjoyed and blown away, like literally jumping up and down and hugging me and saying I was literally a Christmas miracle. \n\nBut then when he asked how I did it, I said it wasn't too hard, I just had to send a couple emails each day. He was curious what I'd said, and I handed him my phone. \n\nHe started to get stressed, and flipping back through other emails. Which there were like 60 of.\n\nHe told me I went way too far, he was expecting me to dispute through their billing department or something normal and reasonable like that, not internet stalk every single manager and board member and investor and harass them into dropping the bill. \n\nI was frustrated because I'd just saved us 5 grand, actually made it possible for us to afford a nice Christmas and save some money, and he was mad at me because I'd been a bit of a hardass? \n\nI was furious, and he was also mad at me, saying he authorized me to dispute a bill, not basically threaten and harass a whole damn hospital for weeks. \n\nAITA for how I got my boyfriend's medical bills dropped?",

Your boyfriend is so unappreciative and is clearly clueless on how diligent you need to be to challenge an erroneous bill.   When the hospital, doctors, and insurance companies are unwilling to help you resolve their errors, what else are you supposed to do?  So many people just quit and either pay the massive bill or go into debt.  Tell your boyfriend this is the only Christmas gift you're giving him.  Clearly NTA.",

The biller filed a claim with the wrong insurance company. I called repeatedly to tell them they had to file a claim with my correct insurer. I reminded them that my insurer only pays claims filed within 12 months. Over and over again. Finally I got a supervisor who managed to bill the correct insurer. But they billed it like 14 months after date of service, so they got $0 of the $967 they wanted.",

I fully intend on telling them to file with insurance listed (from last July) as all other bills in the time frame were covered. If they don\u2019t send itemized or file, I\u2019ll do what I did to another provider and contact the insurance ombudsman, open an investigation, then let them know that\u2019s where we\u2019re at now\u2026and probably it\u2019ll get dropped. \n\nOP I have done almost the same level of work for my own medical bills, and my bf was just in the ER two weeks ago. I told him not to pay anything until I did research. Your step by step guide is honestly EXACTLY what I needed, bc I fully intend to do the same if they drag their feet. So firstly THANK YOU. \n\nAnd I\u2019m gonna show him this ahead of time be like, you don\u2019t get to judge how this happens, so commit now or not at all. Love it.

He felt like I was looking like I was about to threaten them with either legal action or a PR / financial disaster, so they just paid me off to STFU. \n\nWhich to be fair isn't a bad read of what I was doing..",

It's worth raising that with as many people as possible, and who knows you could even prompt them to review their pricing structure.\n\nAsking for specifics of the structure is fine, asking for them to justify the rate is also fine. Speaking to management, board etc is also fine.\n\nThe alternative was ponying up 5k.",

Being assertive and laying out facts very clearly isn't being a dick. Each step along the way, she gave that person a chance to make things right but they chose to ignore her, so she simply moved on to the next. Basic rules of dealing with businesses are to lay out the problem, provide relevant details, and clearly state your expectations to fix the problem. She also used publicly accessible information found online to contact everyone. I see nothing wrong with any of that. Even if they do deserve to be treated like assholes, I don't think that's what she was doing at all.\n\nOP, be proud of what you accomplished and know you're NTA!",

It was a fear of losing control and having someone else act as my representative in a way I didn\u2019t agree to, so they were this total rouge element and god knows what they were going to do to my name and reputation.\n\n\\* I do think OP could have handled this better.Her bf gave her permission to dispute his bill, but he very obviously only expected her to contact billing and do it that way (since that's where she started too). He wouldn't have been mad if he'd hired a lawyer and the lawyer sent emails, because that's what you expect a lawyer to do. It wasn't what he agreed for his partner to do, though. I think if you know your partner is the nervous, anti-confrontational kind and you want to go well beyond what they gave implicit permission for you to do, the right thing to do is to get permission again. It would have taken no time at all for OP to say \"contacting billing didn't work, I want to try something different, is it okay if I do some sleuthing and send emails to everyone in a position of power and all of their investors?\". I'm pretty sure she didn't ask because she knew her bf would say no. And yeah, it sucks when the thing you want to do is something you think is right, but at the end of the day she was acting on *his* behalf, he ought to know what she's doing with that, and he ought to have the right to say \"no\". If I were the bf, I would never, ever trust OP to act on my behalf ever again after this little stunt. She didn't act like a very good partner here, she acted independently with no thought for what *he* would want for *his* bill and *his* money. \n\nIf I hire someone to fix my bath and later they figure they need to rip out the whole bathroom floor and 3 of the walls to do it, I'd expect them to get permission for that because it's beyond what I'd implicitly agreed to. Even if it's gonna cost *less* than the original somehow, I'd want to know.",

Charging people $400 for 2 Ibuprofen is absolutely disgusting (and the like). \n\nNow, as for their Billing Dept. being only \"Collections\", I feel like calling bullshit on that because that same department can also escalate things to Admin, make payment plans, etc.  So that just seems really......off to me. But stranger things have happened. I'd say a rough guide would be Billing Department, Billing Supervisor/Manager, Provider/Doctor, Chief Medical Officer (or presiding MD for said hospital), Admin and finally Board of Directors. Again, rough guide, and there are always many different variables. :)  Feel free to reach out anytime with questions!",

I have the ability to see all claims, insurance payments, EOBs/remittances, and plenty more. I don't know of any organizations whose billing department *can't* do all of that.\n\nWhen a patient contacts me about a situation similar to yours the first thing I do is check what exactly insurance did and didn't do. A 5k bill for a single ED visit when you have insurance would immediately throw up red flags for me that one or more charges may have been denied unless you have an exceptionally high deductible. And if something was denied I can look at what code insurance put down as their reason for denial and personally contact your insurance company about fixing the issue.\n\nYou should NEVER just be left stranded if one person isn't sure how to help. They should give you clear directions on what to do next and get you to someone more knowledgable than themselves. If things arent resolved after talking with a billing representative, you should request to speak with their manager if they dont already offer to transfer you to them on their own. If you still have no luck then your next best move would be to speak with the director of revenue cycle. Ask for their name and direct extension. The next person above them is typically the CFO.",

You knew something was wrong and took the time to fight the battle.\n\nI had a similar thing happen to me years ago. A mortgage company has made an error on our account, admitted it, but never corrected the problem. They just passed the buck from department to department. Eventually, I lost my temper and researched the corporate Board of Directors. I think found the cell phone number of the wife of a board member on the internet. \n\nSo... I called customer service and demanded a manager return my call. I told him I was going to call Mrs. So and So in 2 days (on Thanksgiving) to complain. By the end of the day I had the error fixed AND a free month paid mortgage!",

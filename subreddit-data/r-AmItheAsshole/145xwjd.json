    "postText": "I (F23) am getting married next spring! All the planning has been very exciting and after deciding on the venue, bridal party and filing out all the necessary paperwork, it's time to get a dress. \nMy sister (F24) has made herself a bridesmaid and has been very involved in her own way. She tried to design invitations, pick the menu and has commented on basically everything.I honestly don't mind as we've settled on things we liked, but it does get a tad annoying at times. \nRecently, while talking to my mum about dress shopping, my sister has started saying things like \"you'll be having champagne and I'll slip off to try on a couple dresses on myself\" and \"I wonder how I'll look in a white ball gown\". When I've said anything about it, she made it seem like I was the crazy one for not wanting her to and I'll be honest this is stressing me out a bit. It's a special day for me and my mum as I'm the first of her children to get married and, while it might be selfish, I don't want to share it.\nWIBTA if I didn't take her along to pick out my dress?",

LOL!! Way overstepping boundaries, on her part. I don't blame you for not wanting to invite her, to avoid the drama and stuff. It's not selfish to want YOUR DAY to be about YOU and your husband, and not your sister. It's perfectly understandable how you're feeling. \n\nI would make sure to set some really clear boundaries with her and communicate (because it sounds like you've just been letting things slide instead of confronting her behaviors) with her; especially about her NOT WEARING A WEDDING DRESS to your wedding (or any white dress, for that matter lol). Good grief! Good luck, lady!",

But in fact she badly wants it.... \n\nPsychology is an interesting department. I had a colleague once who had almost a phobia of pregnant women and many times talking about how awful pregnancy is...just that idea of having children is awful... And then she got pregnant and she was over the moon and baby talk and everything....and her phobia was suddenly gone... Btw. She was already in her late 40s by then and thought she can't have children (so her own mind had twisted her desire to have children into a phobia as a coping mechanism) so it maybe your sister's coping mechanism is the denial of wanting to get married but then enjoys everything about it when she has a chance.",

All the planning has been very exciting and after deciding on the venue, bridal party and filing out all the necessary paperwork, it's time to get a dress. \nMy sister (F24) has made herself a bridesmaid and has been very involved in her own way. She tried to design invitations, pick the menu and has commented on basically everything.I honestly don't mind as we've settled on things we liked, but it does get a tad annoying at times. \nRecently, while talking to my mum about dress shopping, my sister has started saying things like \"you'll be having champagne and I'll slip off to try on a couple dresses on myself\" and \"I wonder how I'll look in a white ball gown\". When I've said anything about it, she made it seem like I was the crazy one for not wanting her to and I'll be honest this is stressing me out a bit. It's a special day for me and my mum as I'm the first of her children to get married and, while it might be selfish, I don't want to share it.\nWIBTA if I didn't take her along to pick out my dress?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If she keeps pressing things then demote her to regular guest.",

    "postText": "Lately my dad complains about how he should lose weight and start exercising again, he is visibly unhappy. \n\nToday at lunch, I told my uncle and grandma that they should help my dad to eat healthier. My grandma got mad and said \"I shouldn't call my father fat\" which I never did, I only said I wanted him to be healthier, I couldn't care less about his weight. My uncle said he is a mature adult so he can make his own choices, that I shouldn't push my dad. Then, I continued with he needs to exercise and once again my grandma got mad, saying he doesn't have time because he takes care of her, of the house, of us, etc. The whole time they kept getting mad at me, I eventually just stood up from the table and left.\n\nThank you for reading",

He is a grown man, and he doesn't need his mother and brother interfering in what he eats. That's really strange to me.  I get telling your mother if she's the one cooking for the family, but uncle and grandma seem a little distant, in my opinion, to involve in this.  Also,  if you think this should be done, why not help him yourself? Invite him to talk a walk with you or do other physical activity.  Cook something healthy once a week? Etc.",

I try helping him myself, but I have a health condition, so it's a bit harder for me to do physical activities. Also, I'm a full-time student, so I can't always be there for my dad. I just wish they could help him achieve what he wants, unlike me, who can't be much of help.",

That on top of being the only boy in the followed on me to help my mom out with stuff around the house.\n\nThis normally includes the hard work in the summer and snow removal in the Winter. No normally I have 0 problem doing it. I don't complain about doing it and I try to do it when she wants me to do it but,I am 30 with my own life in my own set of responsibilities.\n\nDue to the excessive heat wave we've been having I haven't needed to cut our yard in the past 2 weeks because it's not long enough.  However my wife and I are going on vacation this upcoming Friday and asked me if I could come over and at least give it a cut through this week.\n\nNormally that's not a big deal cause I would just do it after work with my boss on my PTO for my vacation, I have to work 4 different 10 hour days instead of the usual 8 hour. So my schedule is going to be 6:30 AM to 4:30 PM. \n\nShe asked me to come over on Thursday, I told her Thursday doesn't work because I have to come home take care of the dog due to my wife's work schedule set up everything for the dog sitter Let alone eat dinner and pack. I told her if she wants me to come over and do the yard I can do it on Wednesday, my wife is home earlier so I don't need to worry about the dog and I'm actually working at a closer location On Wednesda.\n\nShe decided to call me entitled and said that if I'm going to do it it has to be on her schedule, I replied that if she wants it done she has to be OK that when I do it and that 1 day is not going to make a difference.\n\nShe then went on about how I'm making it difficult for her, even though she doesn't even need to be at home.",

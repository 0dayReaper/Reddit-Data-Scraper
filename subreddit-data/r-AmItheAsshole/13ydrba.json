We pushed for a longer lead time on the API changes, which had seemed off the table to start. To our surprise, u/spez paused, and agreed to consider it. This call went an hour over its scheduled time as they heard every voice. \n  \n\n  \nOn the call Thursday, over a hundred mods from various communities (including many from our team) spoke on these issues and more, this call went an hour and a half over the scheduled time. Many mods reinforced the need for a delay before these changes take place. \n  \n\n  \nWe\u2019re hopeful that we're going to hear an answer on that in his AMA, and we're going to learn a lot one way or another. What we learn will determine if r/AmItheAsshole and its sister subs go dark. We consider a blackout a last resort after communication has broken down. It hurts the average user more than it hurts Reddit. We maintain hope that Reddit will delay the API changes to continue the show of good faith we\u2019ve seen in the past few days, and that they will deliver on the promises made so far.\n  \n\n  \nThere are changes they've already made to their plan as a direct result of mod feedback:\n  \n\n  \n* First and foremost, all third party apps for accessibility that don't charge their users won\u2019t be charged for API calls (this was a material change resulting from conversations with admins)\n  \n* All mod bots will be granted exceptions (this was already announced, but many missed the notice)\n  \n* Mod accounts and mod bots will now be able to access mature content across all subs on third party apps, so they can keep their communities safe (this too was a material change resulting from conversations)\n  \n* Pushshift (another vital mod tool) is coming back online within the coming 1-2 weeks, those deals take time (we knew about this, but it's still a point some brought up)\n  \n\n  \nThese obviously don't address every concern. And the announced changes don\u2019t help the average user that just likes using their preferred app. Hopefully, a delay on API cost implementation will be enough to keep third party apps from closing and give them the time they need to make the cost viable. \n  \n\n  \nThey were very open about this on the calls, but the reality is some things will take Reddit time to develop. Our point was that just as it would take months for Reddit to reach parity to the third party apps\u2019 level of accessibility and mod tools, it would also take months for third party apps to make adjustments for the new cost. Reddit should delay enforcing that cost until Reddit\u2019s app can provide the same services. \n  \n\n  \nThey acknowledged that they can promise all they want, but that we can't trust them until they deliver. And they're right, we need to see that follow through here. They've made meaningful changes already, and we're hopeful that later today they'll respond to our pleas for a delay. We'll know more after the AMA.\n\nEdit: Reddit, YTA. More information coming soon.",

Reddit is now going to be charging for API calls.\n\n The price they are putting on the API calls is so prohibitively expensive, they are effectively blocking all 3rd party apps. Say I didn't want you to drive my car, but for some reason didn't want to tell you that outright. Instead, I offer you a test drive of my car for the price of $30,000. You're clearly not going to agree.\n\nThe conflict was made worse by Reddit's management, effectively slandering one of these devs and accusing them of making a threat.\n\nKeep in mind, until a few years ago, Reddit did not have an official app. Even the one they currently have is abysmal in terms of data use and accessibility features. Several dev teams have made apps that work properly and have actual accessibility features for disabled users. They did this for a pittance, effectively, working for small amounts of ad revenue, donations, and app purchases. These small devs effectively gave Reddit free traffic from the mobile devices that use them.",

The price rounds up to $1/user for most of the apps, and [Nawhal at least thinks they'll be able to come back as a paid subscription only](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/144pdom/update_on_narwhal_w_the_upcoming_reddit_api/). \n\nThe larger issue (and what that dev points out), is the fact that they were only given a months notice on what the price would be. (Reddit will say \"we told them *a* price was coming months before that. Everyone being surprised by that price is the proof that reddit didn't communicate what they thought they did.) So they were hit with the \"you will need to completely change your entire business model, and you have 30 days to do that before you start running up that bill with us\". Which tracks with the kinds of notice we're given on substantive changes happening. I'm still pissed that we poured so countless hours into building infrastructure to support hosting talks for the long run, only for that rug to be pulled out from under us with little notice on a decision that was clearly made months earlier. *That* is the much larger issue for many mods here too, the significant impact to our moderation practices by these kinds of decisions that harm our communities.\n\nThis nuance doesn't change the impact or the reason for outrage, but I do think it's important to be clear when we're talking to reddit about these things.",

In this context, the API is the way that bots and third party apps \"plug into\" reddit and get the information they need to function and act. (A third party app would be any app that isn't the official reddit one. There's at least a dozen out there) Historically reddit has not charged for access to the API, and a wide variety of bots and third party apps were able to flourish. Some of these third party apps are free, others are profitable businesses, and others fall in the middle. All of them had a different user experience, which allowed you to interact with reddit in a little different way.\n\nImportantly, many of these third party apps provide a UI that's much more accessible for people in need. The most egregious issue is anyone with a visual impairment or who uses a screen reader - from what I understand the official app is so bad that many simply won't be able to access reddit without a third party app.\n\nThat should give you enough of a primer to [understand the context of this askhistorians post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), that explains the larger context around what's going on.\n\nAnd then AMA is \"ask me anything\". In this context it's an AMA reddit's CEO did yesterday.\n\nLet me know if that explains it!",

If it was going to do that, Spez would've backed down in his AMA on Friday. Our goal at this point is to send a message, and even if Reddit ignores that message we have reasons not to make this indefinite.\n\nFirst is that a blackout hurts our users more than it hurts Reddit. We've seen the good this sub can do. We've seen people take its feedback and become better people, have better relationships, and navigate their way through difficult and complex situations. We're hesitant to take that away, which is part of why we've historically refused to ban specific types of posts just because people think they're overdone. Our primary goal is and always will be to help our users, so closing the sub needs to be a means to that end.\n\n Then there\u2019s the fact that there\u2019s been multiple calls and Spez's AMA over the last week. In the notes from one of the calls, in regards to a possible blackout, the admins noted\n\n&gt; Big picture: We are tolerant, but also a duty to keep Reddit online.\n\nThat's a ridiculously ambiguous statement, and we've had a couple conversations about what that means over the past week. We hoped it meant that Reddit would view this duty as a mandate to find a compromise until the AMA on Friday. An AMA where the admins [answered fewer than 20 questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnkd4t3/), where [I directly asked about a delay](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnk4386/) and received [a complete non-answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnk647a/) in return.\n\nThe lack of good faith from the higher-ups at Reddit, and especially the dismissive way they approached the AMA, convinced us that hope was in vain. Which leads us to believe that the decision-makers at Reddit will not back down in the face of unpopularity, but would rather force this through. Reddit has the ability to force a subreddit to reopen, to remove moderators from a sub, and to install new ones. This is usually used at the request of the sub\u2019s mod team, but Reddit could also decide to make examples of a few of the larger subs if they think a blackout has extended too long. It's almost guaranteed not to happen for a 2-day protest, but for an indefinite one?\n\nI can\u2019t say for certain that we'll never go dark indefinitely. All I can say is that it takes a large risk on our part and would hurt our users, and I think we'd need to be fairly sure we could do more good with a prolonged protest. Right now we're not convinced that's the case. But, just like before, we will continue to monitor the situation and we will talk internally and we will always do our best to use this sub's voice on behalf of the users.",

Two days of lost ad revenue is basically rounding error.\n\nWhat they're betting on is that they won't drive away too many users with the period of shitty moderation after mods lose access to all their tools and that the AI people don't actually care about the lower quality of discussion that will ensue.\n\nThis is a process Cory Doctorow calls \"enshitification,\" and we're watching Reddit corporate speed running it:\n\n&gt;HERE IS HOW platforms die: First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I call this enshittification, and it is a seemingly inevitable consequence arising from the combination of the ease of changing how a platform allocates value, combined with the nature of a \"two-sided market,\" where a platform sits between buyers and sellers, hold each hostage to the other, raking off an ever-larger share of the value that passes between them.([https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/))\n\nWill Reddit die? Probably not. But it's not going to be the same. What it will become will depend on moderators - all of whom are volunteers - deciding whether they can maintain their communities as this happens and whether they want to continue to contribute their volunteer labor to feed the extractive process of creating AI training data sets.\n\nRight now, I expect many moderators are still trying to process what just happened and are clinging to the hope that the blackout will work. That's all very human and understandable, but I do hope that they're thinking about what happens the day after the blackout when Reddit acknowledges their right to dissent, talks about how this shows that Reddit is a true community, then changes nothing.\n\n\\[Edit: formatting\\]",

It's not exclusive to this kind of industry but being such a user facing one it's more noticeable I think. ie: Throw out the anti-consumer practice to further maximise profits, see where it lands, weigh up the end profit/loss of going through with it.\n\nWhether mods or users, we're probably all viewed roughly similar as \"end consumers.\"  It's going to be more disheartening for mods because of the added investment in the platform plus the human element of dealing directly with people that, one would hope, would act like people.\n\nThe end result, sadly, is that they can't lose.  If there is enough push back then they'll back off it and undo all the negative PR by \"listening to the users/mods.\"   Not only does it undo the negative PR, they actually increase their public image by looking like they're reasonable.  When Twitch backpedalled their recent proposals recently there were no shortage of people singing their praises (whilst anti-creator practises were smuggled in.)\n\nAlternatively, if there's not enough pushback, they carry on, the shareholders are happy with increased profits and everyone can just deal with it.\n\nWhatever way it's cut, it really fecking sucks.",

Compared to many mod groups, you all seem to have had a relatively positive relationship with Reddit and why jump the gun and forfeit what little leverage that might translate to without giving them time to react to feedback? I think it made a lot of sense to wait, and I\u2019m disappointed that the feedback was brushed under the rug.\n\nI guess the one silver lining is not having to wait until July 1st to know where they stand.",

To determine what's a good fit for you, you'll need to make sure you read their rules, adhere to Reddit TOS, and follow general Reddiquette.\n\nI'm not sure I'm allowed to link to them, but here are some subs by name, which you should be able to find fairly easily with the reddit search function.\n\n***DISCLAIMER: PLEASE READ THE RULES OF EACH SUB CLOSELY BEFORE TRYING TO POST***\n\n**AmIthebuttface** (It's a sister sub to this one, with a bit lighter and less serious approach. The posting rules are less technically exacting than this one. ***However, the sub discourages posts which concern traumatic events which might be triggering for readers***, so I'm guessing something with serious violence wouldn't be a good fit there, and may not even be allowed, though that's not exactly spelled out in their rules, that I could find anyway.)\n\n**AITAH** (This sub has picked up steam lately in size and engagement, and appears to have almost no rules about what conflicts you can post ***except they ask that users refrain from posting anything pornographic***.)\n\n**TwoHotTakes** (This sub reads almost exactly like AITA nowadays, though at first it was limited to AITA posts which had been discussed on its eponymous podcast. It appears that they've expanded their rules to allow users to post thing which haven't been covered by the podcast. Obviously, ***read the rules closely***, as well as the stickied post that appears in the subreddit's home page.)\n\nLess like AITA, but almost certainly good for just about any true-to-life story, you might get good feedback from users of \"TrueOffMyChest\", \"OffMyChest\", or even \"AmIWrong\". There's always the relationship_advice sub, too, which I don't think prohibits mention of violence, but again let me stress: ***read the rules***.\n\nHope this helps, and I hope you're able to find the right community to get the feedback you're looking for.",

It says you can do things that hurt the few as long as you fix it when *I* speak about it. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a small thing. In fact lack of accessibility is a finable offence under some disability acts. \n\nI will go dark. But I will also call out influence spheres that refuse to do the basic level of support. Demanding better from those in any position of power is the most basic thing we can do to advocate for people. \n\nIn addition multiple massive subreddits have announced that they have done dark. Unless AITA has its own unique relationship with Reddit, they also have the same level of influence and still chose to go dark. AITA can have those discussions and still go dark. It\u2019s a cop out and shouldn\u2019t be defended",

Depending on where you pick the data, reddit is between the 10th and 20th most visited site on the internet (depending on data point) with a valuation of $10 billion in 2022.  They're not small fry, \"good faith\" goes out the window.\n\nAfter a quick pushback Twitch just did a 180' on sponsorship deals yesterday.  Quick immediate and LOUD action can and does have an affect.\n\nLike you said, there's a reason they chose a short timescale.  It's deliberate and they're not the first to do it.  And no doubt their admins (not the actual executives of the company, just admins) are pushing for a \"wait and see\" approach.\n\nA company this size only cares about one thing, the bottom line.  Individuals in the company may care about more, but they are not, and never will be, the company.\n\nWhether it's all the videogame companies looking at NFTs, or twitch's plan to change monetization or Bobby Kotick wanting to charge COD players per bullet, a resounding community based \"Fuck you\" is the only thing they'll listen to.  Because it makes it look like it'll effect their bottom line.\n\nWhilst AITA isn't in the top 30 subs, it's one of the most well known across the net.  Not joining the blackout is an acquiesence, a falling in line, to the intention behind the short notice.  \"Wait and see, we're working on it, WE. WANT. TO WORK. WITH YOU....oh whoops sorry, change has happened can't go back, get fucked.\"  It's not new tactics.",

I\u2019m sure AITA have a unique position that the mods of 50 million + subs like r/aww do not. You may believe they are doing their best but I simply do not. This isn\u2019t a time to bargain and realistically the admins themselves have little power here so those discussions will go nowhere. \n\nWhat will cause Reddit to listen will be their pockets. Advertisers being frustrated that they are paying to be on a site that no one is visiting. Hope the mod talks go well. But AITA having these special little chats isn\u2019t going to do a thing. \n\nIn general I suggest you stop defending the mods to the degree I\u2019ve seen in your comments. It always leaves a bad taste in peoples mouths when valid criticisms are shot down by the mods besties. R/subredditdrama has a lot of cases like that. It damages mod trust more than anything.

            "comment": "We have received many inquiries regarding Reddit's upcoming changes to its API usage. We are following this issue closely, and continuously reassessing our involvement as more information continues to unfold.  \nPlease do not mistake our efforts at collaboration and open discussion as complacency. We are deeply discouraged by these announced changes, and believe they will prove detrimental to our moderation efforts and - more importantly - the end user experience. These 3rd party apps would not be as successful and ubiquitous as they are if Reddit's own platforms provided the same quality of user experience and accessibility. Reddit should strive to do better than these tools with its own native tools with the same dedication and investment it has dedicated to its new cost structure. This is feedback we have stressed, and will continue to stress to the Reddit admin team.  \nWe are, at our core, a conflict resolution sub. We would like to come to the table with a shared effort to resolve this conflict and help influence the best possible solution. There are conversations that are not optimistic wishes, but real, planned events happening this week and likely into the future. If we feel our voices are \"heard\" but not listened to, we are ready to take additional steps to ensure our feedback is sincerely considered.",

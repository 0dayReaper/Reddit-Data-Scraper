I might be the asshole because they are religious and object to me living in sin with my fiancee, so I am basically extorting them into shutting up.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I did laugh out loud when you said where you got your blackmail information.  Grandma had that in her pocket for a long time I'm guessing.  Congratulations on your upcoming wedding.  Merry Christmas and I hope you have a great New Year.",

Might sound trashy but the entire town knew so it seemed worse they were pretending otherwise when both my brother and his now ex wife were really happy about the baby\nETA for context, they wanted this wedding rushed and wanted a lot of expensive things then tried to tell my parents they had to pay for the alcohol, my parents said they couldn't afford that for 60ish people, were told if you can't pay for it all it will be a dry wedding. Tried to shame my quite poor parents into paying for their dream wedding that was only happening because they wanted the shot gun wedding in the first place! Worked out in the end because my parents were literally broke and couldn't afford it. That's the real trash, people that could afford it in an instant but chose to humiliate my bankrupt parents, who still put in several hundred dollars that they couldn't afford, instead",

Effectively renaming common-law marriage and expanding its scope. It's a fairly conservative province (Alberta  Canada....often called Canada's Texas). The concept came into being when gay marriage was a big controversy still. I think it was done to sidestep explicitly recognizing gay marriage but I think it's so much more powerful,  especially for older people (or anyone) who don't want to come out of the closet. \n\nI think it was largely prompted after a case where man was evicted from his home of many, many years after his friend and roommate died, and the deceased's kids got the house.\n\nBasically any two adults who have an interdependent relationship are effectively \"married\" with respect to the property and health related decision making. This isn't recognized federally so there's no federal tax benefits, but the province's pension plans recognize it as a common-law marriage.\n\n\nI can't tell if it was intentionally progressive or just the bureaucrats passing one over on the right-wing politicians who saw it as making a mockery of gay marriage. Which is also legal, regardless.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_interdependent_relationship_in_Alberta",

Or an anti-kink. \n \nBut literally, a lot of Christians believe that sex should ONLY be missionary, in the dark, for the purposes of procreation, and of course the woman doesn\u2019t orgasm because she doesn\u2019t have to to make the baby. Mary was a \u201cvirgin\u201d when she had jesus, you know, which meant she was \u201cpure.\u201d It\u2019s over in 30 seconds, and some denominations even believe you should only have sex once per child. Masturbation, of course, is the worst thing you could ever possibly do. \n \nThen they shame their kids for it, and go crazy, and take away their doors, and put them through hell. \n \nI was raised super conservative Christian, I refuse to step foot in a church now, and besides the bigotry and anti-LGBT horror, the one thing i don\u2019t think I will EVER be able to forgive the church for is this hateful sex-related shame. The amount of guilt, shame, anxiety, and horrible stress I went through about sex as an adolescent/teenager is honestly pretty unforgivable. \n \nI love my parents to death and they\u2019ve really chilled out since when I was growing up (when I told them my gf and I were living together, they were happy about it, which was almost unfathomable to me), but when I realized in college that a lot of other kids went through their entire life without having this massive, crushing existential sex-based shame holding them down, I fucking lost it. Then I got ANGRY. \n \nHow the fuck can you do this to your child? What the fuck is wrong with people?",

She got on her high horse talking about how to have a long marriage and chastity before marriage was a major theme of her holier than thou TED talk. \n\nFast forward 6 months and her thrice divorced son is turning 40 and mommy can't let her oldest boy go uncelebrated even if he's newly single *again* and you know what soap box she mounted when she cornered us girl cousins again, right? Purity before marriage! Here comes the no sex before marriage lecture again and the oldest, saltiest of my tween/early teenage cousins interrupted her to ask, \"Auntie, was it six months ago we celebrated your 40th anniversary?\" When I explained the drama later to my mom, who had had her fill of the holiest of holy women as a SIL, almost choked to death holding back tears and laughter because it was such a perfect takedown.",

Wound up being a pinched nerve.  Anyway, a few months later we're in the car with my father-in-law and my husband was telling him the story.\n\nWhen he got to the part about the pills my father-in-law starts spluttering, 'birth control pills? birth control pills?  Why was she......oooooooh, I get it! She was on birth control pills to regulate her hormones and make her cycle manageable!'.  He gives my husband a relieved smile and my husband looks at him like he's deranged and says very slowly and calmly, 'nooooooo, dad.  She's taking birth control pills so she doesn't get pregnant when she has sex with her boyfriend!'.  \n\nI thought the old man would have a stroke right then and there.  He started in with a protest and my husband cut him off with, 'she's a normal healthy young adult and she's had the same boyfriend for four years and she's making responsible life decisions '.   His dad started off trying to tell what he thought about the whole deal and then my husband shut him down cold with this, 'look, I was sexually active when I was younger than her, and I KNOW you were sexually active when you were younger than her,  and at this stage in her life I'd rather see her taking a pill every day than taking care of a baby every day.....like you and mom did with me when you were still in high school!'.",

So IF the reason they're uncomfortable is because they're so religious they can't cope with the idea of their unmarried kids having sex, they should be just as against moving in together right before the wedding. \nThey don't care about \"living in sin\", they care about what other people think.",

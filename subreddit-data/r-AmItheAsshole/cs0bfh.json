I do wish OP would've suggested that so we could see how he reacted...like, maybe it was an impulsive thing he hadn't fully thought about. I mean, I get some of it - I'm gay and my sister's wedding was the first time some of my extended family met my bf, but that's more because I just never see them (and didn't expect any issues).\n\nI would love to talk to brother and figure out what his thought process was. I suspect there was some element of, \"If I do it today, maybe people won't freak.\"\n\nAs a sidenote, I haven't seen anyone mention that this is totally a TA thing brother would be doing to the boyfriend.\n\nEdit: Yes, people, the wedding is a week away. But this was brought up several weeks ago, with plenty of time to address it. I also wonder how long OP waited before saying something to his brother - like, if he let the brother think it was fine for those several weeks to only backtrack it later. Not that it changes my judgment of the situation, but it would explain why it got more awkward between them.",

Have the brother introduce his bf to everyone who will be accepting in an event a couple weeks out. And then go to the wedding with him, using all the younger people to shush the old ones. Nothing shuts an old, traditional, homophobe up like all their kids and grandkids harshly whispering to not cause a scene at a wedding.",

Any wedding other than your own is NOT the place to come out. \n\nI suspect the gay brother figures that coming out at the wedding would 1) let him come out to the whole family all at once and 2) be so overshadowed by the wedding that people would hardly notice. Number 1 would happen, but not number 2. Instead, his coming out would become the centerpiece of the day.\n\nOP tell your brother exactly this.

Many weddings are expensive and take a LOT of time to plan, reserve venues, and set up catering. This revelation could torpedo everything if they're strongly anti-gay.\n\nIf there was 6 months 'til go-time, maybe, but not ~6 days to the event! Some people are willing to hurt family to have their way, and the gay debate is a big topic that still rends families apart daily.\n\nI dont envy OP at all...\n\n#NTA",

He is acting to take advantage of your wedding, while you're just trying to enjoy your wedding.\n\nI would tell him it's fine to bring his boyfriend, but only if he chooses to come out to the family at least a couple of weeks in advance of your wedding.

So, both my sister and I are gay, but she was a few years older than me and so she hit college first... and discovered something. Turns out, when you're at college/in the LGBT circles, everyone's really supportive, but it's almost... weirdly ranked that way, by how much support you need. \n\nThis uni had a thing called 'coming out by candlelight' where you tell your coming out story at the start of the semester, if you have. Now, just as an example, if two people told their stories to this group, and person A said, \"Yeah, I came out to my parents, they were shocked but said they loved me no matter what.\" and person B said, \"My dad kicked me out, my mother killed herself and my uncle is still driving around the city looking to kill me with a bowie knife since I did it last week!\" - Person B is worthy of this weird celebrity status in the group. Everyone respects them more because their life was worse, will go to them for advice. \n\nBecause we attended the same college, people asked me, 'Oh, so how did your parents take you coming out, after they kicked out your sister and disowned her?'- my response was \"Sorry fucking what?\" and explained my parents didn't kick her out- they paid for her entire college ride, every cost of living, and helped her move out because she didn't want to live at home, then told lies about it. \n\nThis is because she wanted Outrage Currency. The more of a shitstorm it is, the more bigoted responses you draw out, the more fellow people in the LGBT community respect you. This ebbs after 25 years old, for most people, but damn in this early years is it super nuts, especially around college. \n\nI don't really fully get why it IS a phenomenon, my sister still does it at 30 years old- she'll aggressively make out with her girlfriend on public transport, but they're basically no-contact when on their own or not around anybody who 'cares'. \n\nI'm not saying OP's brother is... like this... but goddamn, a wedding is pretty on the nose, and I wonder if this is an instance of this phenomenon. BTW, this isn't a dig at LGBT people- I am one, and it's not exclusive to that community, just where I first encountered it. But, I do wonder if he has some additional motivation to do it because of how much of a **huge deal** it'd be to do it at a wedding.",

Although, the difference with AA/NA is that you actually *want* someone who has experienced the same types of trauma as you, in order to have them as a sponsor.  I knew people in AA/NA who smoked weed for 6 months and quit, but still go to AA/NA 3 years later because they just like to talk and get attention.  They're also usually the first to stand up when asked \"Can anyone be a sponsor?\"\n\nI was an IV heroin addict for nearly a decade (I'm in a program now and clean), but to me that kind of person would have nothing to offer me.  I need to know if the people I am taking advice from and listening to are pseudo-addicts looking for attention or people who really did suffer (through one of the most taboo diseases that exists), and make it out alive, because it could mean life-or-death to me.  So, in a way, I do like to hear those rock-bottom stories, as long as they are legitimate of course.",

And you're right, he should be granted the same acceptance of any couple. The issue isn't the coming out, it's the timing as you said, _and_ the circumstances of the family. As OP said, they're aware of several family members that will not take well to it and it is the one day that OP and his Miss deserve nothing but a peaceful happy day. Knowing that and to use it as a \"well everyone's in the same room\" is unfair because everyone is in the same room for a very different reason. What also stands out is that OP is _very_ supportive of his brother and has clearly offered to help with this announcement well in advance of the wedding and even weed out the dickheads after the fact. \n\nI'm sure you're right and the brother doesn't want to steal the spotlight but it was a very poor decision to drop this on OP just weeks before knowing the potential fights that could cause. \n\nP.S.

Your brother doesn't have to come out at your wedding but he doesn't have to come without his bf as well! Also, old people generally leave early at wedding, they don't stay for the party night! You can tell your brother that past midnight he'll be allowed to kiss his bf in public! Everybody will be drunk anyway!\n\nand also maybe you can contact the bf without telling your bro, will be a nice surprise for him! And if you do that it will def end the little grief he has over you atm (even if you're not the AH!). Contact the bf, tell him about the situation and tell him to just wait the party to kiss each other in public! I think that you're worrying a bit too much over this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: also everybody here seem to think that your bro plans to make a big coming out. Like standing on the table and clinging the glass of champagne \"hum hum, I'll like to make a BIG announcement to the family since you're all here... so this is Tom, Tom is more than my friend, he's my boyfriend and we are Gay!\"... I don't think it's the case, I think that he just wanted to come with his bf, and not make waves, try to be discreet, maybe quickly tell some family members that he trusts, and see how some people seems to react. Maybe he was planning at best to hold the hand of his bf during the ceremony! More like a taste the water kind of thing, not like a big coming out!",

He will not be able to control how people act and the rule is never do anything that would upstage the couple unless they give the ok.  \n\nIf he was already out, of course he should come with his boyfriend.  But since he isn't and wants to come out at the wedding, he has no control over how people react.  Using your brother's wedding as a shield is a shitty thing to do.",

This is why I think he's an asshole. He isn't thinking of how *you* will feel and what *you* will be putting up with on *your* wedding, only that *he* wants the two people *he* loves so that *he* can enjoy *your* wedding.\n\nI'm bi. This isn't bigotry speaking. This is me being so tired of people not actually thinking about how they're going to affect others. Your personal struggle with your sexuality is amazing and horrible and it's own huge roller coaster, especially when you get to that late in life and still live in the closet. However, your decision to stay in the closet doesn't magically mean no one else is entitled to their special days. You do not have to let him take over your special day just because he's decided he's ready now.\n\nIf you did let him take it over like that, you'd be a saint. But not letting him do it (given the context of how supportive you've been and the fact that this never seemed to be a matter of his safety but just him not wanting things to be awkward) is the neutral stance.\n\nAnd friendly PSA to all closeted gay people reading this; if someone isn't willing to give up their day in the spotlight for you, that *does not* mean they don't support you. It just means that they want to enjoy their day. You'll have a special day too, but that moment in time is the other persons time to shine. It's not selfish for someone to not give that up just for you to come out, the same way we wouldn't think denying any other big announcement on someone else's wedding is selfish. Stay strong in your fight, but remember it is *your* fight. Appreciate those who put in the extra effort to help you but don't think of the world as out to get you if they don't help you.",

I get the sense OP would consider even risking this if it meant his family could come to acceptance, but his inclination is that this fantasy is not their reality. Kind of seems a (I originally said cowardice but I don't believe that it is the right word, too strong, as it is a scary thing to come out to unaccepting family) move to use brother's wedding, and future sister in law and family, as a buffer. Perhaps they can all take part in an event at a later date to speak with family so brother can support and protect, but \"this is not that day.\"",

There is a time and a place for family discussions and a wedding isnt it. I would definitely try to explain how you feel to your brother so this doesnt affect your relationship. I doubt he is thinking about it from your point of view. He likely just finally got up the courage and figured people may not react as badly if they're at your wedding and is using you and your wife as a meat shield, even if unknowingly. If he wont talk to you, write him an email and explain how much you support him and his BF, but how this one day is about your wife. \n\n\nMaybe he can tell the family before the wedding and if there isnt too much drama with the answer, have him bring the BF?",

He's not gay, but he basically left my mom and got with the woman I think of as my stepmother very abruptly and in a way that caused a lot of drama. Then, he wanted the first time the extended family met her to be my cousin's wedding. She, like you, declined, and I think you're both right to. It's not the place or time for that. Maybe the four of you can go out at another time to privately celebrate together?\n\nAlso, I'm glad he didn't up his AH game and refuse to go to the wedding at all, which is what my dad did. It's great that he understands, and hopefully being together on the day will smooth things over more when he sees your happiness. Again, if you can find a way to celebrate with them, I think that will really go a long way too.",

Wanting to bring his bf and therefore coming out at a wedding will put him at the center of attention and will take away from the bride and groom. This is not the place to come out, period, he should know that",

I don\u2019t think your brother is trying to be a dick, it seems like he has good intentions. But if he were to do that on your special day, it would very quickly become about him and not you and has the potential to crash the wedding.\n\nI would be honest with him about this. It\u2019s going to hurt him, yes, but it\u2019s for the best for everyone involved. He needs to reserve his moment for a time where he is the focus, and in a more private setting.",

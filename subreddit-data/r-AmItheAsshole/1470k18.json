This is fine in our family, just more of a note per context.\n\nMy oldest brother has two kids and a wife, but they've become estranged / NC for their own reasons that are vague to us. It's been 4 years now and we don't see our nephews or my brother/ SIL. It was hurtful to me, my kids, and definitely my parents. At this point we just don't care.\n\nOtherwise, my local cousins have their own lives and we don't really see them or their kids.\n\nNow as the youngest in my family and also closest in proximity to my parents, naturally there are a lot of instances were I help my parents with life, their pets, and their health. My oldest would help, but since he's estranged it's now all my responsibility. My brother's and I all live within 50 miles of my parents. My parents are in their 70s, they haven't been the best about taking care of themselves IMO.\n\nMy dad almost died two years ago due to a small wound that became an infection that led to complications which hospitalized him for a month, he had to get emergency surgery. He was only saved from this because I asked them to watch the kids and my mom said they couldn't, because he \"wasn't feeling well\". After hearing the details on the phone I made her take him to the emergency room.

But we are just no longer happy living in this area.\n\nOK... So with our three kids, we live in a small house in Los Angeles County, it's an expensive area and we just don't like it anymore. I'm from LA so it's hard to consider but my wife and I agree it's time to move somewhere else. We want a normal size house that can fit our family, have safe streets, and have good schools. This is possible in LA county but you have to spend a lot of money and often the houses are still in need of TLC.\n\nWe're thinking about moving to San Diego, no more than 2-3 hours drive away on an average day.\n\nAre my parents to going to decline in health after we move? Is that my fault, I feel like I have the power to keep them healthy? My oldest brother likely will still not step up, and the middle helps but doesn't seem to car as much.\n\nWIBTA to move my three kids, more than half of my parents' grandkids and the only ones they have contact with away to a different part of Southern California?",

Acknowledging that while in some cultures taking care of one's parents is considered an obligation of adult children, there are options for this in the US.  If you're worried about their health declining, then maybe look into hiring on an at-home carer of some sort, who just pops in from time to time?  Obviously, this depends on how much room you free up in your budget after the move.\n\n2-3 hours is barely any distance at all in the grand scheme of things.  It's too easy to drop by on weekends and holidays if you're really concerned.  A lot of families only connect during larger holidays.\n\nBesides, in this modern age of face-time and video calls, it's not like your parents will be entirely out of contact with their grandkids if they don't want to be!",

            "comment": "NTA - you are NOT responsible for the well being of your parents.  They are adults and responsible for making their now decisions even if those decisions are bad ones.\n\nWhen you married your wife, you and your wife created a family unit and you and she are responsible for the health and well being of your children.  The needs of your family unit come first every time and are a higher priority than your parents.  Your children deserve a good life full of activities and friends.  It is not their responsibility or yours to make them visit their grandparents every week. It is your responsibility to make sure your kids are in organized activities, have friends, have play dates, and an all round good life.\n\nYour parents, if unable to care for themselves or their house should consider downsizing into a senior living community.  I suspect that your oldest brother started prioritizing his wife and kids over his parents, which is the circle of life.  Your parents probably didn\u2019t like that causing the no contact situation.  If you don\u2019t know the details, you should have a 1-1 conversation with your brother and truly listen to him.  Don\u2019t justify your parents actions, be neutral and listen to his reasons for the no contact.  Perhaps you can rebuild some sort of relationship with him if that is what you both want.\n\nYou should move to wherever you need to be to support a good life for your family, they are your responsibility.",

This concern for your parents probably stems from gratitude for them taking care of you while growing up and you feel it is your turn to care for them. That is a wrong thought process. Your responsibility is to care for yourself and your children, just as when your children grow it will be their job to care for their children if they have any. \n\nI'm not saying that you shouldn't help them, but helping them shouldn't be the factor of all decision making.

However, it sounds like you're concerned about your parents wellbeing without local family support, and frankly, I'd be a bit more concerned that your oldest sibling is estranged for a good reason that you're not aware of. \n\nReturning to the thread of concern about their welfare running through your post - one option is to put time &amp; energy looking into local services that could help your parents maintain their independence, like Meals on Wheels. \nThis would ensure that someone locally regularly checks in on them &amp; helps with things they may be struggling with more as they age.\n\nIf an emergency comes up, you'll find out sooner, and be able to make arrangements to visit them, or call other local family or friends for more help. \n\nHere are some links for services for older adults in California that may be helpful. \n\nhttps://mowca.org/\nhttps://socialservices.sccgov.org/about-us/department-aging-and-adult-services/resources-for-older-adults",

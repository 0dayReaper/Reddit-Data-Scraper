    "postText": "[original post](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dqx11/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_that_i_dont_give_a/)\n\nI sat down with Layla a few days after my initial post and really talked with her about why I felt her and Kyle's request was unacceptable and I laid out my biggest concerns -\r  \n\r  \n\\- I eat mostly plants so nuts &amp; soy are like 50% of my protein. So my grocery bill would increase because I\u2019d have to make it up in animal products. Who\u2019s going to pay for that? I\u2019m not vegetarian but I don\u2019t really want to eat like that and I definitely don\u2019t want to pay for it so would they make up that increase?\r  \n\r  \n\\- I honestly didn\u2019t trust them to stop there. i already did what I felt was a reasonable accommodation and it wasn\u2019t enough so how long til they take coconut, eggs and tomatoes from me too?\r  \n\r  \n\\- It was weird af to ask me in the first place and I felt really disrespected because this is my home and I don\u2019t take second place to a guest. I can to her, personally, of course but that doesn\u2019t extend to the apartment.\r  \n\r  \nI said I would agree to continue not using his serious allergens when he was present or soon to be and that was the line. It didn\u2019t go over well at all and Layla told me I was overreacting and I could just do it and kept talking over me when I tried to say that I wouldn\u2019t. Eventually she slipped up with the \u201cwell what if he moved in\u201d and I said absolutely not and ended the conversation with her for the night.\r  \n\r  \nWe argued in circles about it for nearly 2 weeks and once it was out, she didn\u2019t drop it. I realized it wasn\u2019t going to get better so I did what I didn\u2019t want to do and told her that I was going to the landlord about breaking my part of the lease and she freaked out. Idk where Kyle\u2019s money goes but apparently he doesn\u2019t have any because she was yelling about not being able to afford it on her own and he couldn\u2019t help even if he moved in. I told her that this had gone way too far and I didn\u2019t think I could be happy living here with her anymore; if it were easier for her to leave instead, that would be fine too. She was really upset and I said I wouldn\u2019t force her out or leave her suddenly on the lease alone but it was one or the other. Eventually she accepted it and decided she would move back in with her dad. That was the end of April and she\u2019s fully moved out as of this week.\r  \n\r  \nMy childhood best friend Allie has been flip flopping on moving to my city for forever now and me calling and saying I had an cheap open bedroom if she came right away got her to finally pull the trigger on it. And it helped Layla out because she didn\u2019t have to pay to break the lease since I agreed to cover the full rent at my own risk. Allie has stuff to tie up in our home state still but she\u2019s already sent me half of July\u2019s rent. I just gotta squeeze for a lil while but I\u2019ll make it. I\u2019m super excited to see her and show her around! Plus we\u2019ve been cooking together since fourth grade so that\u2019ll be a nice change lol. and I can get a cat! It\u2019s been a bit of a rough couple of months but I\u2019m very happy with how things are looking right now so I just wanted to share with you guys.",

Even in the very rare case that rent is split by bedroom alone, bills (power, water, internet, cleaning supplies) is still super common to split by flatmate, so total bills are still relatively equitable",

But, sh\\*t happens and friendships can be strained when $ enters the equation. I strongly recommend you get Allie on the lease ASAP so that she has to pay her rent to the landlord and not to you.

Best case scenario there's silly annoying fights now and then, worst case scenario end of friendship. There's really only one friend I trust to live with with no problems atp. So look out for yourself and your friendship at the beginning itself, lay out both of your rules, hard nos, sharing of labour etc as soon as she arrives. That way it's not awkward and no one ends up seething silently!\n\n\nI'd also suggest taking into consideration of the possible changes in the both of you cuz I'm sure you both are different people now as compared to a time when you spent significant amount of time together, on a regular basis. \n\n\nGood luck :)\n\n\nETA: to people replying with happy friends turned roommate experience ---- obviously my experience is not universal but notoriously popular among the people of the age group op and I belong to. I'm glad y'all had great roommates. \n\nI only made the comment because op just had a bad experience with a roommate and is about to move in with a childhood friend. It's safe to assume they both haven't spent significant time together in their present age. They might have some expectations based on how they were as kids. It's better for op and their friend if they got everything out of the way before an awkward time. \n\n\nThis comment is only a suggestion of taking precautionary measures, only directed towards op and definitely not targeted towards people living with happy roommates or of a significantly different age group.",

The older I get, the more I find that when people are weird about their reasons for wanting you to do something, the more likely it is they are not telling you the real reason.\n\nWaaaaaay too many people go in for the manipulation tactics and guilt tripping to try to get their way instead of just talking to people. Like, if she'd just been up front with you about the desire to move in her boyfriend eventually and had the discussion about whether you'd be willing to give up your food to allow it, she could have had time to look for a new place together with her boyfriend, instead of being forced to move out because you were willing to break lease to get away from her harassment.",

            "comment": "OP, please listen. Do NOT have Allie pay you. Do not let her move in. That makes her an illegal tenant in an illegal sublease. This is grounds for eviction on almost all standard leases.\n\nInstead, go to your landlord and ask if Allie can be added to the lease. They will likely agree. This protects them and you. Once this is done, Allie can move in. \n\nI\u2019m doing this with my tenants right now. One is leaving and is being replaced by another, and I have no problem with it. I even covered the cost of the background checks. Had they done this without telling me, there would have been problems, because that would have been a major violation of the lease. \n\nSo please, go to your landlord. Explain the situation and ask about Allie moving in. I don\u2019t want you to be evicted over this, or to end up in a legal mess over the subleasing.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nThe situation is following:\nI'm usually the one who plans trips in detail or buy things and so on when we are out, (buy things online for one because she doesn't have online banking)\nI usually have no Problem with doing it and all if they work with me. Now the last trip happened last month and I had to basically run and beg for their answers and I was really pissed off for their Lack of involvement. \nDon't get me wrong, I understand that people are busy and one works but they could at least respond once in a while especially when  it's about important things like we're we stay and all, especially since that person had some demands about it.\nNow the total  for the Hotel was at first 70\u20ac, which I had then to switch because they doubled the price. I got a better one and surprisingly for like 65\u20ac   and I didn't correct the price for them.\nGetting myself a Bonus of around 5\u20ac in total.\nI felt a little guilty about it but also not at the same time.\n\nAnother Example happend recently, I bought online something for a friend and received a sudden discount for reaching a certain amount\nof 5\u20ac  for every item and I thought about correcting it not to her since I would use it for a quicker shipping.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I'm the last person to be the one collecting debts or anything. I don't mind if I'm the one who pays sometimes, knowing my friend pays as well but recently it started to get out of hand in my mind especially since they seem to take it for granted that I do everything for them.\n\nSo the problem is, would I be the asshole for keeping money differences to pay myself for the work I do? Or would it make me bad friend?\n\nAdditional information:\nIt's about two friends and I know they are financially stable since they mention it frequently by saying things like:\n\"Oh just 30\u20ac? That's cheap\"\n\"Oh even if I don't like it, it's just 20\u20ac\" \nAnd stuff like that\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If it was a substantial amount you are rebating your self or saving with their purchase contribution and you don\u2019t say anything then it would be a different story. \n\nOr if you were purposely telling them it was a higher amount in order to get more money because of them being flaky, that would make you TAH.",

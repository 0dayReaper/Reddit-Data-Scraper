No it would've been tragic had that worsened within everyone's presence and suddenly an intended celebration gets rained on. Good call on you.\n\nCan also understand why your parents would try guiltily you into going, I bet you 10 out of 10 they were checking to see if you were in fact faking. Only way to suspect that would be if you caved in to their gas lighting and \"lost\" your headache. \n\nNo blood no foul, definitely a shitty tactic to pull on kids, and if you were faking it, an AH move.\n\nI'd say parents are level 45 out of 100 of being an AH. Definitely AH behavior, understandable though.",

They are not as severe as they used to be.\n\n\nToday was my little cousin\u2019s first communion. The whole service was lovely, until I got a massive headache. I\u2019m not sure why or how I got it but it was really awful and painful. \n\n We were supposed to go to my little cousin\u2019s house for an after party, but I simply could not fathom going while my head felt like it was incredibly bad, So I asked my dad to drive me home. \n\nHe then proceeded to treat me as though I was having a panic attack, and tried to convince me it was one. I kept saying \u201cno, I\u2019m not having a panic attack, I\u2019m really in pain\u201d, but he wouldn\u2019t listen. He did end up driving me home anyway, which was nice, but once we got home my mom called me and started yelling at me asking me why I wasn\u2019t going.\n\nThis confused me because I had mentioned to her that I was going home right after the service. I\u2019m guessing she just didn\u2019t hear what I said? After the phone conversation with her, my dad started scolding me harshly for not going to the after party. I was very confused as to why I was being yelled at by both my parents because I thought the after party was just a casual thing and I wasn\u2019t feeling well, so why should I force myself to go?\n\nTurns out the after party was a fancy dinner prepared for all of us, which I didn\u2019t know about. This makes me feel very guilty for not going. However, my parents also ended up apologizing saying they labelled me as having a panic attack when I wasn\u2019t, which is true. \n\nI texted some family members and told them I wasn\u2019t going to the after party and apologized for that, and they were totally fine with it. \n\nBasically I think I might be the asshole because I skipped a fancy meal that my uncle and aunt made for all of us, but I also don\u2019t think I deserved to be punished and not believed by my parents as a 21 year old. \n\nMy dad had also told me that he and my mom jump to the conclusion of me having a panic attack and didn\u2019t believe me when I said otherwise because they are \u2018triggered\u2019 by me feeling sick due to my high school years being awful because of anxiety. I can understand how this would trigger them and make them feel upset, but at the same time I don\u2019t think they should be angry with me for that. \n\nHe also told me that as an adult I should be able to \u2018push through\u2019 these things (not feeling well). I understand that, but I feel like I\u2019ve pushed through a lot of things and done many things I haven\u2019t wanted to do just for the sake of my family\u2019s happiness while I was feeling bad. I\u2019m not sure if it was fair of him to say that, especially since he isn\u2019t me and doesn\u2019t feel what I feel. \n\nEven though they both apologized, I get the feeling that they still think I\u2019m an asshole. They said things like \u201cit\u2019s 90 percent our fault\u201d, basically not taking full blame. It feels like they still secretly think I\u2019m to blame. \n\nSo, AITA? Or are my parents TA? Or are we all TA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Even then, you shouldn't be forced to an event unless you're being accommodated. I once as a kid had to go to a family function with a low-grade fever, and a few months later, I was also diagnosed with migranes which I'm pretty certain in hindsight I was experiencing a migrane simultaneously as the fever. Anyway, my family was very understanding. My aunt, who left her kids with her family (we're also birthday neighbors, she's the day after me), massaged my tiny forehead lightly. I think she also knew I was experiencing a migraine, and luckily, the pressure subsided. But anyway, if accommodations can be met, such as; laying down in a dark room away from the party I wouldn't personally be opposed to going, but would also keep the option open to go home.",

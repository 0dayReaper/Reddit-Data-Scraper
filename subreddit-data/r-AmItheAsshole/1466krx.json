    "postText": "I was at a restaurant, waiting for my friend to arrive, as I'd gotten there a bit before our reservation and they were still on the way. (If it's relevant context, it was a fairly decent French restaurant, so nothing too casual or super upscale.) I was given a table next to a couple; the woman was maybe a foot to my left, and the guy was maybe two feet from me diagonally, so we were in pretty close quarters.\u00a0\n\n\nSoon after, the couple started to berate the waiter, complaining about the bottle of wine they'd ordered. The woman's glass had some sediment at the bottom, and they were angry about it, claiming that it must be an indication of some sort of contamination, and as further evidence it \"tasted weird\".\u00a0\n\n\nThe waiter (justifiably) said that this was normal; I'm no sommelier, but I know that sediment is not some contaminant and can even be valued as a sign of aged or quality wine. The guy got pretty angry, saying, \"I've traveled all over the world, to more than [x] countries, and I've never seen that at the bottom of a glass!\"\u00a0\n\n\nThe whole thing was pretty awkward, and I was basically elbow-distance from these strangers engaged with our waiter. I also was about to head to the bar to check on something (I'd ordered a bottle of wine myself while I was still at the bar, before getting the table, and was going to offer to grab the bottle and glasses so they didn't have to bring it by themselves). So as I got up, I said to the couple arguing with the waiter, \"that's normal, it's just sediment\" before heading to the bar. When I got back to my seat, I saw that they'd gotten a free glass of wine as compensation, and I otherwise didn't engage. The guy made a point of saying angrily to me, \"You know, you didn't need to get involved!\"\n\n\nIt all seemed pretty absurd to me in the moment, but reflecting on it later based on how intense their reaction was, I did sort of wonder if it'd be better to say nothing, even though I knew they were in the wrong and berating the waiter for literally no valid reason, as far as I could tell.\n\n\nWas I in the wrong here?",

Sediments might for some types of wine indicate improper storage. smelling the cork might be a way to check aswell. \n\nTreating servers poorly is a AH move, but you interferring making the assumtion that the wine in no way could have been bad/contaminated makes your involvment unwanted and rude. Confronting them about they treat servers would make you NTA, but you didnt, so you will be percieved as the AH.",

Oxidized wine can taste pretty bad.

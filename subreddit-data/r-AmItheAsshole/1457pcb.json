    "postText": "I (32M) and my wife (31F) sleep in separate bedrooms. It sounds a little weird but it isn\u2019t. My wife has went through some things and one thing she refuses to do is sleep in the same room as someone, the only exception is babies and children. \n\nShe told me from the beginning she trusts me with every fiber of her being but she just cannot do it, of course I didn\u2019t care and I have my own little bat cave where I sleep.\n\nNow here\u2019s where the actual story is. My sister (27F) asked if she could stay over at our house for the weekend because apparently her and her roommate got into an argument. Me and my wife agreed and I told my sister about my wife\u2019s room thing, if you know she\u2019s sleeping don\u2019t go in there. My sister was always kind of a spoiled brat but it really shone here, she complained that the bed in the quest room was to lumpy and she didn\u2019t wanna sleep in my room because of my \u2018man smell\u2019.\n\nAfter all this it was obvious that she would complain about the couch too. I told her my wife\u2019s room was off limits and it was either the options we gave her or she could find a motel. She agreed and everything seemed fine, until I woke up at 3 in the damn morning to my wife yelling along with my sister. When I went to go see what happened, my wife was crying, and my sister was just yelling back. I learned now that my sister sleeps in her underwear, so that made it even worse. I got into the argument and starting yelling at my sister to get her crap and get out. Had one rule and she broke it. Her last statement was calling my wife a crybaby. My wife told me that my sister was trying to sleep in her room, possibly trying to kick her out?\n\nAfter that I got text messages and calls from my parents saying I was a horrible brother for kicking her out like that, and agreeing with her saying that my wife was a crybaby and she should suck it up. Of course I just didn\u2019t listen to it but my wife came to me and starting talking about how I could\u2019ve handled it better, and how  she got texts from my mother saying the same. She said later the same day that she has happy i protected her. Still don\u2019t know why she said that, but it was probably my mother.\n\nThis is really for if I should just apologize and get my parents off my ass. AITA?",

You did the right thing by kicking her out.\n\nI read your comments about your wife's sexual trauma. I can't even imagine how scared she must have been, waking up with a barely clothed person in her bed without her knowledge or consent. Even without the trauma, your sister would still be in the wrong. It might be best to limit or cut contact with your sister (and your parents) if she truly doesn't think she did anything wrong.",

You sound like a thoughtful partner, so you might have considered this already, but it might be helpful to be really gentle with your wife right now, and to let her know that what she experienced was objectively upsetting, and her feelings about it are understandable and natural. \n\n\nYour sister sneaking in (in her underwear?!) was bad enough. And at first, your wife understood that your sister deserved the consequences of her actions, and thanked you for helping her. But I think the more insidious issue here is what has come after. \n\nThe texts from your family NEED to stop. Right now. No matter how much healing she\u2019s done, it can be so, so easy to slip back into the mindset of, \u201cEverything that has happened to me was not as bad as I said. It was not as bad as I felt. I can\u2019t trust my own feelings. I\u2019m dramatic. I need to be different. Why am I like this?\u201d And I\u2019m sure you know that this is a dangerous spiral. \n\nShe\u2019s already questioning her own judgment. It might be prudent to really sit her down and (gently) remind her that it was bad, you agree that it was bad, and the people who are texting her now (your family) are the ones who made your sister who she is today, and have a vested interest in believing she isn\u2019t a brat. They can, and should, be ignored. If she wanted to block them for a while, that would be okay. Because she doesn\u2019t need this noise. \n\nI\u2019m really glad you stood up for her. I hope you both have a peaceful weekend \u2764\ufe0f",

Your sister probably got kicked out of the place with her roommate for similar reasons and she needs to understand that people have boundaries and when you cross them, you have to face the consequences.",

Your sister was yelling at your wife. She deserves to be kicked out. She fucked around and found out the consequences.\n\nI would tell your parents you did exactly what they taught you.

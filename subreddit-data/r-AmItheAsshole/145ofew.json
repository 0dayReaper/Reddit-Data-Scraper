    "postText": "(Throwaway account just in case) \n\nFor context: I (22M) am the youngest of two, and I have severe anxiety and depression, and am recovering from agoraphobia. My father (56 M) is the type of father who doesn't really 'get' mental health stuff. I'll call him while I'm having a panic attack and his response is \"stop panicking, there's nothing to panic about.\"\n\nHe's also the type of father who doesn't apologize. \n\nWell, my entire life I have been made fun of by my whole family.  When I was young, they would frequently pick on my weight, my speech impediment, so on. When I would cry, they would tease and call me a 'crybaby'. This mainly came from my older sister and father, but my mother sometimes joined in.\n\nAs I got older, I lost the speech impediment and gained severe anxiety and a case of agoraphobia (a case so bad that I became extremely uncomfortable just walking in the backyard.) While my sister also struggles with anxiety and my mother works in psychiatric care, my father saw these as new targets to make fun of.\n\nI could never air out my anxieties without him making fun of how irrational they were, and how stupid I was for even thinking them. \n\nI brought it up once, when I was 18. he told me to 'toughen up' and 'stop being so sensitive'. I left it there.\n\nWell, recently I was thinking about that, about how I was raised and how it possibly contributed to my mental illness. It was piling up and I was getting annoyed at being made a target. So, the other day, while he was making fun of how much I filled my plate (It was dinner and I hadn't eaten all day.) I made a comment. \"This is why I don't come out to see you guys.\"\n\n\"Oh is that it?\" Maybe I misunderstood, but my father frequently pokes fun about how 'lazy' I am. That's what I took this as.\n\nSo, I left. I went back to my room in the basement. (due to unfortunate circumstances I had to move back in with them abt a month ago.)\n\nHe came down not but a few minutes later, asking me what he had done wrong. So, I tell him. I told him that I don't like how much he makes fun of me, that it makes me uncomfortable, and I wish he would at least ease up on it.\n\nHe told me, as he did the time before, to 'toughen up' that he was 'just joking'. No apologizes. No accountability. I had seen my sister argue with him about this and I knew it was like talking to a brick wall, so, That was the end of the conversation for me. When he realized that was it, he stormed off.\n\nHe hasn't spoken to me since. Whenever I did come back upstairs, he actively avoided me. I texted and asked him to pick me up a drink from the gas station tonight and he left it on my couch instead of handing it to me, didn't speak a word and just walked off. Even my mom has started to act more curt towards me. \n\nI feel like garbage, but, I know I don't want to apologize for trying to set up boundries. So, AITA?",

If it were that simple people wouldn\u2019t have all these problems. \n\nYou can try to talk to him again and explain but I think it\u2019s not going to make a difference. People like this have their old school ways of thinking and are likely not to change. \n\nSorry you have to go through this. Wishing you luck and all the best.",

Unfortunately abusers are experts at gaslighting us into believing we\u2019re being overly sensitive when we are upset by their abuse. It\u2019s completely reasonable to be upset by abusive assholes. I realize therapy and support groups can be difficult to access with agoraphobia and social anxiety (I have major social anxiety and depression), but one positive development of a few years in quarantine is that there\u2019s a lot of support available via Zoom - I encourage you to reach out to find a community that can provide some healthy mirroring and build up your sense of self.",

I don't think your comments were out of line given the history, especially if you've had similar arguments/conversations in the past (not sure about this with details provided). While your father's comments and lack of understanding of the seriousness of mental health over years of opportunity to learn is not good behavior, that he came to you and asked what he did wrong means that he cares. It sounds like he doesn't have the vocabulary to have the kind of conversation and support you want from him right now. \n\nIt's not always a fair burden to have to teach your family how best to support you but if you want your parents to respond differently to your mental health struggles, you may need to explain it exactly. Instead of 'toughen up,' what would you like to hear? \n\nI hope this helps. Still NTA",

    "postText": "(I know sleep training is a divisive subject and not for every parent. I am not looking for opinions on sleep training methods specifically, just the situation below.)\r  \n\r  \nMy baby Oliver is 5 months old and is a decent sleeper; however, he is a nightmare to actually put to sleep. He cries for at least 20mins and nothing will settle him except picking him up and giving him a cuddle, but that resets the whole process and we have to start again. We've also had to resort to rocking him in his pram until he falls asleep. (He is not hungry/dirty/in pain when he does this; he just hates being put to sleep. Medical issues have been ruled our by our paediatrician.)\r  \n\r  \nSo we sought the help of a sleep consultant who taught us a method whereby we let Ollie cry for 2 mins, then go into his nursery and comfort him for up to 10mins to try and get him back down. Ollie has taken to it really well - he'll still cry for the first 2mins, but usually only takes one settle for him to get to sleep. We're on day 5 now and so far it's been a huge success!!\r  \n\r  \nThe problem is that we live in an inner-city suburb in Australia - our house is a workers cottage which are very narrow and close together. We share a party wall with one house next door, and the house on the other side is about 6 feet away.\r  \n\r  \nOur neighbour Jessica lives in the detached house, but her bedroom is 6 feet away from Ollie's nursery. Jessica was out the front of her house when our sleep consultant left, so we discussed it briefly and she wished us luck.\r  \n\r  \nLast night, Ollie woke at 3am. We left him for 2mins, then settled him quietly for 10. He cried again, so we did two more minutes and then resettled him and he fell back asleep.\r  \n\r  \nThis morning Jessica knocked on our door and called us AHs for \"letting our baby cry all night\" and bothering the neighbourhood. I apologised, but told her that it was cumulatively 4 minutes, which is a lot better than the 20+mins it used to take to get him back down to sleep. She said it's different as we're letting him cry now and she knows that for those two minutes we're not actively trying to get him back down. The thing is, though, we are. It's a different method but it's been working super well and the amount of time Ollie spends crying is extremely low compared to what it was before. He's actually less disruptive, and I believe not insignificantly.\r  \n\r  \nI tried to explain this to her, but she kept saying it was \"just cruel.\" That annoyed me, as it sounded like she was taking issue with the idea of sleep training, not the actual crying. I told her that while I'm sorry for the noise, Ollie is our baby and we will make parenting decisions without her judgement. She left, calling us inconsiderate assholes.\r  \n\r  \nThe thing is, If Ollie is crying at night for any reason, she'll hear it. And if I'm putting myself in her shoes, I'd greatly prefer to hear a couple of minutes of crying than 20+ mins! I don't want to be inconsiderate, but I really believe this is the right thing for Ollie.",

It sounds like you have the situation more or less under control, and are actively trying to get yours to sleep at night. \n\nIf you want to mend fences, then approaching your neighbor in a positive way might be a way to go about it.

It\u2019s your child and you should do whatever you think is best for your child. \nBut, as a childfree person I am going to say this and lots of people are going to be bent out of shape but it\u2019s your child. You chose to have Ollie. You are therefore ok or not, with being up at 3 am when he cries for 10 mins. I get that. But I did not and if his crying wakes me up at 3am, I might not go back to sleep. Since Jessica knows the context more, she is saying more but if it were me, I would just straight out complain. Not the first time, not the second time but the third time I would. I get that it takes a village to raise a child but you can\u2019t force people to be part of your village and people get to opt out of certain parts of it. It\u2019s their right. \nI think the suggestion about putting up sound dampening panels and anything else that you can do to make sure the crying doesn\u2019t disturb your neighbours is a great idea. It\u2019ll save you a lot of aggravation and frustration later. Sleep regression at various stages might mean that you have to sleep train him again though it\u2019ll be faster. He\u2019ll teeth and that\u2019ll be uncomfortable and might mean more crying and since you are sleep training, it\u2019ll mean you leave him crying off and on. \nAnd lastly, if you don\u2019t want people giving you their opinions about your child rearing techniques, don\u2019t open the door to it. Draw a boundary but then stay behind it yourself as well. It\u2019s unfair to tell someone that I am doing A,B,C because of this and then when they say I think that\u2019s inappropriate, get upset.

It\u2019s not some antiquated \u201ccry it out\u201d method where you just leave your baby for hours to cry without any comfort or support; good God I would never do that!\n\nI put the disclaimer because as I\u2019ve discovered in the last 5 months, social media and the internet in general can be really vicious about parenting opinions. Just look at the breastfeeding v formula discord, there are some people out there who would literally have you strung up for disagreeing with their methods if they could.",

The recommendation when my kids were babies was for them to sleep in the parents' room for the first 12 months anyway. Moving the baby might solve the problem entirely.\n\nWe never sleep trained, fwiw. We held our babies until they fell asleep and then put them in their cots. We found it was much less stressful for all concerned.",

I could hear him if he started to get unsettled and just reach over to set my hand on his back and he'd go back to sleep. Or, if he was awake, he'd play with my fingers for a while. He never cried nor did he ever make enough noise to wake my husband.\n\nI don't think babies cry because they are awake, I think they cry because they are alone. I think sleep training teaches a baby that after 2 minutes of crying, someone will come and rescue them but they have to cry to set this in motion. I do think of this as not natural... not sure I'd call it cruel.\n\nNot giving a judgement because everyone raises children differently and you don't have a clue if you're right or wrong until 20 or 40 years later. Just offering an alternative if it would fit in your lifestyle.",

    "postText": "My husband &amp; I are expecting. This is our first baby and we're excited. Thing is he barely attends any dr appointments with me and his excuses aren't even valid. He's willing to miss the dr appointment over soccer or a drink or board game with friends. His response is always \"I'm not the one carrying the baby, why do I have to go see the dr with you?\".\n\n\nLast week was my final straw. He was supposed to come with me for the baby's gender reveal appointment but he chose to not come last minute because his friend invited him to fish 'n' chips meal. I was pretty livid but didn't make a fuss about it. Mom went with me instead.\n\n\n\nHe texted asking me to tell him the results (boy or girl) but I refused to tell him. He kept spam calling me but I hung up each time. He came home fuming demanding I tell him the results but I refused and bluntly told him, since he refused to attend the appointment then he gets no results til after the baby's born and said I was wiling to die on this hill. He went off calling me spiteful and immature for doing this and punishing him. He said he's the father and has the right to know. He then called me dramatic since I wasn't alone and mom was with me. I said he gets no results period.\n\n\nHe's been fuming about it and told his family and they're now pressuring me to stop playing mind games with him and tell him but I declined.\n\n\n\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: Hi, so, first of all, wow!!! I did not expect this to blow up. Sorry, can't answer any comments because of feeling overwhelmed...um I just wanted to mention that my husband just attempted to contact my dr to get the results. It didn't go well and we had another argument over it. He couldn't get it since his mom was the one who made the call.",

My husband didn't come to many of the ultrasounds or OB appointments due to work travel but the 20 week ultrasound he rearranged work travel to be at - and we were team green. We opted not to find out the sex of the babies. It was too important of a scan from a fetal health perspective for him to miss.\n\nOP, your husband is MASSIVELY immature. I'm honestly concerned about the type of father he'd be.\n\nSo, for anyone that ends of spamming you about this, because you WILL get crap from his friend and family group soon, this is what you text back.\n\n\"My husband thought being at the anatomy scan, which also determines the health of the baby's vital organs in addition to the child's sex SO important, that he he prioritized going for fish n chips with his buddies over coming with me to this appointments. CLEARLY fish n chips is more important to him than finding out whether his child is health. So, until he gets his priorities straight, he and everyone else can wait. If you want to find out the sex of the baby, I suggest you put some pressure on him to man up and behave like a father.\"\n\nSeriously, though, Sis. He is showing you who he is and what his priorities are. Do you really think anything is going to change long term? I mean, he prioritized fish n chips... you can't get much lower than that.",

What he has zero interest in is the *responsibilities* of parenthood, or being a partner to his wife.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if he refused to help with night feedings, diapers, mealtimes, bath time, bedtime, taking care of the kid when they're sick or taking them to doctors appointments, school pickup or dropoff, shopping for Christmas presents, or carpooling to activities he's not interested in like ballet or cheerleading - that'll all be \"her job,\" and if she ever leaves him, that's when he goes on every social media platform to complain about how horrible she is for not letting him see his kid - \"I'M THE FATHER! I HAVE RIGHTS! LET ME BE A *FATHER!\"*",

Not with anything that matters anyway, like the night feedings in the beginning or the hard pre-teen and teen stuff.  Prepare yourself for that, whether or not you remain with him.  To be honest, be ready for him to bail at the birth too, because it's uncomfortable for him, and he's not the one who has to go through the childbirth.\n\nNot to mention somethingkooky's point that you never know if you're going to get not-so-great news.

And also I really do wish that people (partners, family of both parties, extended friend groups etc) realised one very important thing about these scans: Finding out the gender (if you want to know) is a happy bonus. It is NOT the point of the actual scan.\n\nThe point of the scan is to find out if the baby is healthy and growing well! It's to confirm they have a heartbeat, that they have the appropriate limbs and organs, that their skull has grown over the brain, that there are no signs of a serious medical condition that is incompatible with life, and that there's nothing wrong with the placenta or anything that could cost you YOUR life.\n\nEvery day people go into these scans and get the worst news possible. And so many people dismiss that aspect because they're focused on what genitals the baby has. \n\nMaybe instead of focusing on what the baby has between their legs, your partner should be grateful that he didn't get a phonecall from you sobbing in a waiting room going \"There's something terribly wrong\". If he had I doubt the fish and chips would have tasted quite so good afterwards.",

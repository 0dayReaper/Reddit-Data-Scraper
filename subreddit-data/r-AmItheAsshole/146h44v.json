My mom/grandmother's friends are pretty kind people I've never met either before today. They're a mother and a son, the mother is experiencing health issues and is on a list for a lung transplant, and her son is autistic, non-verbal, and blind. \n\n I will say that my issue was never having to help them out my issue is that I didn't even get a choice nor was it even mentioned to me until I had to do it. \n\n The worst part of all of this is that my birthday is tomorrow. You'd think my family would want to spend the day with me but no, nobody even considered it. I know sounds like a monster but seriously man. It stings knowing that not a single person out of 5 wanted to spend even a little bit of time with me.   I'd have to wake up on my birthday surrounded by people I don't know, in a place I don't know. I've been iffy with sleepovers my whole life, this is not new for me to not want to spend the night somewhere but I don't even like going to other family members' houses and spending the night so why would I just go and sleepover with strangers?    \n\n My birthday hasn't mattered since I was 11 and well aware but they didn't even ask me.   I would have said yes to helping them out because that's how I was raised but what if I had plans? what if I just wanted to sleep in and play my game to be fair I do this weekend but still, why am I a 16-year-old girl expected to just give up my day to strangers... Like I've mentioned I have no problem with helping them out and I would be even if I got the choice but com'on (come on)   This makes me feel like I'm just a pawn in everyone's game like my worth is the same as a cup or plate. I feel horrible for even thinking this way but  AITA?",

I'll be honest, if I heard an inexperienced 16 year old girl was being told to spend the night to take care of a severely disabled autistic person, I'd be calling social services on behalf of both of you. No way should either of you be in this situation. How old is this autistic son? \n\nWhat happens if he has a toileting issue or needs a bath? You are not qualified for this. You need to ask your parents the details and let them know you are not a qualified worker. \n\nThat aside, what happens if he has a melt down? Do you know how to handle such a thing? \n\nWhat happens if he wakes up in the middle of night needing something? Why would you need to spend the night? Why can't you pop by in the morning or afternoon?\n\nIt's one thing to pop by, say hello, load up the dishwasher and make sure they have a cooked meal to eat. The level of care that I have a feeling they're requesting by having you spend the night is, frankly, insane.",

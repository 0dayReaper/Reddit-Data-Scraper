    "postText": "My boyfriend died and I messed up my legs in an accident five months ago. I had to be in bed for three months due to that, and that messed up my academic timeline and now I'm graduating a year later. Now I'm depressed and I don't have energy to even get dressed or go to the lab. I even cut my hair short because it was too much effort to take care of it.\n\nMy friends Harry and Sally have helped me through this a lot. Sally is my best friend and Harry is my lab mate. They met through me and started dating two years ago.\n\nSally started taking me out for drinks every weekend, just the two of us at a local bar. It so happened that the bartender at that bar was a girl from my high school, Hannah. I caught up with her, told her what recently happened, feeling a little good about meeting someone else I knew, and soon we were hanging out at the bar with other friends from my lab too. I thought meeting her helped me a little, but soon it started to get bad.\n\nWhen Harry proposed to Sally, Hannah had said maybe tying the knot was for the best, because probably then I would stop trying to woo Harry. When asked what she meant, she said it was obvious I was trying to steal Harry from her. Why would I, I was the one who set them up. She refused to explain why, and I tried to let it go.\n\nThen she started sending me tiktoks like \"signs you're a pick me\" and said lol this is you. Her reasoning? I wear nothing but sweats all the time, and now I've cut my hair, and all my friends except Sally and her were men. I can't help that I work in a lab where I'm the only woman because of the issues in STEM academia. And I still don't have any interest in dressing up or the energy to put an effort. I asked her to stop, but she didn't listen and continued to do it. I just let her have it because I didn't want to start a fight with her.\n\nThe last straw was at Sally's bachelorette. I did dress up, finally, because I didn't want to put a damper on Sally and I certainly could try for her. But the issue was shoes. I didn't wear high heels because my legs are still pretty bad, and I have to wear the customised orthopaedic shoes. They sort of look like sneakers. Hannah asked me if I thought it was cool to wear sneakers with a dress and said it was classic pick me behavior. I couldn't take it anymore and I snapped. I told her to stop saying that, and the reason I do this is because I've been through something she'd never understand and that she was very foolish and downright stupid to not understand that I'm not doing what I'm doing on purpose. I had done that in front of everyone at the party, and Hannah broke down, saying I humiliated her in front of everyone.\n\nSomeone took a video of our fight and now everyone in our highschool knows about it and now I feel bad about it. I could have confronted her silently but I just couldn't take it anymore. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Clarification, everyone I went to highschool with. I wasn't really thinking when I wrote this and now I see what it sounds like. We like to keep in touch with each other.",

No idea why she is so insecure about you simply existing, but her using your physical and emotional damage as a way to browbeat you and make you feel small is unacceptable. Her being called out for that in social media from the video ultimately is due to light being shone on her behavior, and people finding it abhorrent. Because it is.\n\nHannah sucks.",

If Hannah secretly loves OP, even if she's resentful of that, OP's opinion of her will be pretty important to her.",

The one I listed is the possible origin that is most linked to the meaning.\n\nFrom Wiki",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy boyfriend died and I messed up my legs in an accident five months ago. I had to be in bed for three months due to that, and that messed up my academic timeline and now I'm graduating a year later. Now I'm depressed and I don't have energy to even get dressed or go to the lab. I even cut my hair short because it was too much effort to take care of it.\n\nMy friends Harry and Sally have helped me through this a lot. Sally is my best friend and Harry is my lab mate. They met through me and started dating two years ago.\n\nSally started taking me out for drinks every weekend, just the two of us at a local bar. It so happened that the bartender at that bar was a girl from my high school, Hannah. I caught up with her, told her what recently happened, feeling a little good about meeting someone else I knew, and soon we were hanging out at the bar with other friends from my lab too. I thought meeting her helped me a little, but soon it started to get bad.\n\nWhen Harry proposed to Sally, Hannah had said maybe tying the knot was for the best, because probably then I would stop trying to woo Harry. When asked what she meant, she said it was obvious I was trying to steal Harry from her. Why would I, I was the one who set them up. She refused to explain why, and I tried to let it go.\n\nThen she started sending me tiktoks like \"signs you're a pick me\" and said lol this is you. Her reasoning? I wear nothing but sweats all the time, and now I've cut my hair, and all my friends except Sally and her were men. I can't help that I work in a lab where I'm the only woman because of the issues in STEM academia. And I still don't have any interest in dressing up or the energy to put an effort. I asked her to stop, but she didn't listen and continued to do it. I just let her have it because I didn't want to start a fight with her.\n\nThe last straw was at Sally's bachelorette. I did dress up, finally, because I didn't want to put a damper on Sally and I certainly could try for her. But the issue was shoes. I didn't wear high heels because my legs are still pretty bad, and I have to wear the customised orthopaedic shoes. They sort of look like sneakers. Hannah asked me if I thought it was cool to wear sneakers with a dress and said it was classic pick me behavior. I couldn't take it anymore and I snapped. I told her to stop saying that, and the reason I do this is because I've been through something she'd never understand and that she was very foolish and downright stupid to not understand that I'm not doing what I'm doing on purpose. I had done that in front of everyone at the party, and Hannah broke down, saying I humiliated her in front of everyone.\n\nSomeone took a video of our fight and now everyone in our highschool knows about it and now I feel bad about it. I could have confronted her silently but I just couldn't take it anymore. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You had a horrible accident and you\u2019re recovering. Your friends, who just happen to be a couple, have been there for you. They\u2019re great friends.

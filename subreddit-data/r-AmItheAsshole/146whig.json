She's a neglectful mother who abandoned her kid, unless OP is leaving something major out of the facts. I think that the push-back on the use of the word is that when you say 'technically she abandoned her child' is that it can read like the person meant the legal definition of child abandonment, which usually doesn't apply when you leave the child with the other parent. I think the pushback is because she probably can't go to jail for her actions.\n\nHowever, I do think OP should talk to his lawyer, because if he's paying child support based on 50/50 custody, but in reality he's got custody for a much greater period of time, then that's grounds to change the parenting plan. One month might not be enough to establish a pattern, but his lawyer will know what would do it.",

I was just following the conversation thread where someone said 'technically she abandoned the child', someone else chimed in with the point that in some places legal criteria on what qualifies as abandonment differ, and you stated that it was still abandonment. I was just clarifying the point of distinction between you and the previous commenter. \n\nMorally, ethically, all of those measures, this is abandonment. I agree fully. It would be very harmful for a child, especially one whose mother lives in her house with her, to suddenly have her mother disappear without a single word for a month, even if she still had her other parent. I am not defending this woman. But legally, depending on the jurisdiction, she might not qualify for criminal charges. \n\nThis woman abandoned her child, regardless of how the law views it. I agree with you on that.",

If she left the kids home alone unsupervised, it is.\n\nAnd yes there\u2019s gray areas because what does and doesn\u2019t constitute as abandonment is going to vary.

In most states, the period of time is one year, but this varies. \n\nhttps://www.justia.com/family/adoptions/termination-parental-rights/abandonment/\n\nChild abandonment occurs when a parent, guardian, or person in charge of a child either deserts a child without any regard for the child's physical health, safety or welfare and with the intention of wholly abandoning the child, or in some instances, fails to provide necessary care for a child living under their roof.\n\nhttps://www.findlaw.com/criminal/criminal-charges/child-abandonment.html\n\nShe was gone for 2 weeks without notifying her child's husband but the child (presumably) was in safe hands with her father.",

Refusing to show up for your custody time is a civil matter. I do think that OP should document all of this and bring it to his lawyer, though. If a parent refuses to use their custody time, then that can be grounds to reduce it. And if OP is parenting the child for more than 50% of the time, then he should definitely qualify for a child support reduction (or, depending on their relative incomes, she might be required to pay him child support).",

It does not look good in court. It doesn't matter if she was going to come back at some point, or if she has a want to act like a mother.\n\nWhen men move out of the house to allow their children and the mother to have the house, this is often used as \"abandonment\" in family court, as disgusting as it is. It's why you should not leave unless you've done something very wrong. Your wife cheats or wants a divorce? So be it, but don't leave the house for her sake, as it can and will be used against you. \n\nAt least, as a man it will be.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo my ex-wife and I have been divorced since December but, since then, she's lived in my house (in the divorce I was awarded it 100% and she signed a quitclaim and everything) without paying rent, utilities, or anything. We have \"50/50\" custody and I pay child support. When she is here she just sleeps and plays with her phone. I cook, I clean, I help my kid with homework, etc. I've been bugging her to move out for a few months now. \n\nIn May, she decided to go on vacation (by herself) for what was supposed to be less than 2 weeks. Me and my kid are at home, having a good time, but then the day she's supposed to come back rolls around and she's no show. Then a few more days. During this time she's messaged her daughter once, me never, and her mom is calling me to find out where she is. \n\nI eventually get a hold of her and she says she'll be home late the next day. Well that day rolls around and she's a no show again. At this point I'm just tired of her immaturity and I phone her Mom and Dad and tell them they need to come load up and move everything that's hers out of my house and move it to either a storage unit or their house. \n\nWell eventually she decides to grace us with her presence after nearly 4 weeks of being gone. At this point I've had to cancel things I had planned and all of her stuff has been relocated to her parents place. She loses her shit (understandably) and says I'm abusive and had no right to have her stuff moved. \n\nEventually she calls her parents and gets a ride to their house. I don't appreciate my home being used as free storage for someone ungrateful like her. And I don't think her vacation was fair to me, her daughter, or her family. Adults with kids don't just take month-long trips alone because they \"feel like it\". \n\nBasically, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That generally goes to the custodial parent.  \n\n2) if you have 50/50 custody and she has been living with you, why would you be paying child support?\n\nIt's time to get that custody thing changed.  Make sure that you tell the court that she just up and left  for a month and was pretty much no contact.\n\nNTA",

I am with you on kicking the ex out, though.\n\nConsider re-evaluating the custody and child support agreements. Your ex has proven herself to be selfish, unreliable, and uninterested in being a mother to her kid. I would be concerned that the kid will feel like she isn't wanted by her mom when with her, the kid's school work will suffer, and your ex may use the child support money for herself.\n\nOh, and change the locks on your house. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if your ex tried to steal from you.",

The topic of minorities and immigrants having difficulties came up. I said, that I think they should be given more help. Then my two friends responded that their parents worked very very hard to make it to their current countries, and give them both a better life. I told them that both their parents probably worked very very hard to make it to where they are now, but that there was also an element of luck to it, and that there are people who worked as hard if not harder and didn't get a better life. My friends both took this personally and got very upset at me. They said, I would disrespect their parents and shouldn't speak for minorities and immigrants. I made sure to clear up and said multiple times that their parents probably worked very hard and that I do not doubt that. but they assumed I was lying since I said \"probably.\" The reason I used that word was, because I haven't met their parents and don't know any further context of this, I told them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were two other friends in the discussion: one person sided with me, and another with them.

They made a choice to do x instead of y or z, when y or z weren't *wrong* choices, just that x was a better choice that gave them more opportunity.",

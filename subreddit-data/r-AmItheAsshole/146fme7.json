    "postText": "So I recently told my best friend that I don't like her SO. For the purpose of this story, my best friend is Jess and her SO is Kyle. They have been together for around a year and a half, and to be completely honest, I didn't have the highest opinion of Kyle in the first place. However, this was unfounded and just a vibe, so I've never mentioned anything and have always been civil with him on the few occasions we've hung out. \n\nAnyways, a few weeks ago Jess invited me along for a day trip with Kyle and a few of her friends. I went, it all starts off as a lovely day. A few hours in, Kyle and some of the pals start making some inappropriate jokes, which very quickly became quite r*cist -Note: I was a passenger in Jess and Kyle's car and we'd driven 2 hours outside of my home city and into the countryside at this point. I don't drive - so I said nothing to avoid an awkward day that I couldn't bail on,, but I didn't get involved. \n\nFurther into the day more and more r*cist comments and jokes were made and, just before getting in the car to go home, Kyle dropped the N-word VERY casually. No one reacted, and I really didn't know how to call this out without an extremely awkward 2-3hour drive home. I thought for a few weeks on how to bring this all up to Jess, and tell her how deeply uncomfortable the whole situation made me feel, but we haven't seen each other in person since the trip. A few days ago, we were talking on the phone and she was talking about her and Kyle's plans to move in together, and it just came out. I said I didn't like him and that he is r*cist, and naturally it didn't go down well. \n\nJess got very angry at me and has defended everything he said, and even accused me of making up a lot of the things he said on the day, and claims that no one else on the trip remembers it the way I do. She is super unhappy with me, and is defending Kyle completely and saying that I'm an AH for throwing the word r*cist around without thinking of the consequences that could have for someone and that I'm lying to make him look bad. She says I should have called them out at the time if I felt uncomfortable, but I've tried to explain how I felt trapped in the situation and based on her reaction now I have mentioned it, I was right that it would make things worse. \n\nI think I definitely brought the whole thing up in a bad way, but AITA here? \n\nAlso, everyone involved in this story is white.",

Honestly OP, I think it's time to reconsider your friendship with Jess and start putting some distance in between from here on.",

We lived when it was accepted behavior and, such as in my case, our families were blatantly rcist. I know 2 things for a fact based on that. \n\nYou absolutely did the right thing keeping silent on the trip. You may, indeed, face repercussions had you spoken up  -- and that would make anyone uncomfortable. Your friend is wrong about that just as (I believe) she is also wrong that no one else on the trip remembers it the way you do. How can she know that unless all of them discussed it? Yes, you 100% did the right thing.\n\nSecond, if Jess isn't bothered by Kyle, that makes her an enabler. I'm sorry, but it's sick to defend rcsts they same way it's sick to defend bullies, homophobes, batterers, sexual predators ... the list is long and contains many degrees of horror. But it's all wrong.\n\nAs for bringing the whole thing up in a bad way, I think you did it the right way.  She cannot say you're wrong and not find herself implicitly allowing Kyle and his friends to act like rcsts. They are all horrible and you're in the right on this. I wish you luck and love and, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for staring racism down. You're my new hero.",

You didn\u2019t do anything wrong by mentioning that you don\u2019t like Kyle, perhaps you and Jess can still be friends but just see her separate from Kyle, possible, but unlikely.\n\nJess is defending her BF because she doesn\u2019t see the jokes as a problem, racist jokes are something that were a very normal until very recently, many many people don\u2019t view telling racist jokes as racist behaviour. Many people tell racist jokes while still having good relationships with family and friends in those minority groups.\n\nNow your reality is that you have to accept that Kyle is a part of Jess\u2019 life for the foreseeable future, and accept that he tells some jokes that you don\u2019t like, or you\u2019re going to have to stop seeing Jess altogether if the jokes make the situation unbearable for you. Either way there will a tension because of what you said to Jess.",

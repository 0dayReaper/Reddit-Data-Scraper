Shouldn't the best man get a plus one especially if it's a big wedding? This is basic wedding etiquette and makes the couple sound either completely clueless or self-absorbed or both. \n\n2)  suddenly this weird lonely man has a huge ass wedding full of people and the only potential flower girl is your daughter with whom neither the bride or groom have a relationship?",

My husband is a bit of a people pleaser and sometimes does it at my expense. I usually don't fuss about it because more frequently his generosity is directed towards me and our family, so I ignore the occasional annoyance. However, this time my husband is convinced that I am in the wrong and is upset at me and that pisses me off.\n\nThe issue in question is the upcoming wedding of one of his friends. He met this guy at work and this friend has had some personal tragedies in his life that made him lonely and depressed and my husband was a huge support for him. While they are good friends and I have met him a few times socially, we are simply pleasant acquaintances. Friend started dating a woman a little over a year ago and a few months ago they got engaged and then quickly set the wedding date. \n\nMy husband was asked to be the best man. He checked with if that was ok and I asked him to not commit to spending much since we are on a tight budget for now. A few days later the fiance asked my husband if our youngest daughter could be the flower girl and he checked with me if that was ok and I agreed to it. The way they jumped from a quick engagement to a quick wedding, I assumed this was a simple backyard wedding with a few close people and my daughter will be with my husband the entire time. I never got an invite to the wedding which added to my assumption that this was a small affair. \n\nI found out it was a big fancy wedding when my husband admitted that he paid $200+ for a tux rental picked out by them and that our kid will need a fancy dress. I backed out of allowing my kid in the wedding party then. The bride and groom offered to pay for the flower girls dress and her hair and makeup (??!!). That weirded me out even more and I said I am not comfortable sending my kid with people I don't know, with a bride I have never met, at a wedding I am not even invited to. Husband says I am over protective of my kid and if I am that concerned then I can accompany her. I find that absurd, what exactly am I going to be doing hanging around as my kids attendant?! I don't even understand why the bride wants to borrow some kid for this event instead of using someone she knows, I mean she's having a huge wedding party, surely there is someone there she can put in her pictures.\n\nA few weeks later the groom asked my husband to be a groomsman instead of best man. Husband was a bit irritated but he doesn't really mind and thinks that this happened because of my behavior. \n\nAm I the AH here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is the norm for most everyone I know with kids and responsibilities. Summers are especially busy for us because kids have camps, sports and competitions. Our budget and time is tightly planned out for kids activities, travel for their competitions and family vacation during the break. We need at least six months to plan and save up for splurging on an expensive wedding and this one was put together in just 2 months. We are also caretakers for sick and ageing parents and have to coordinate for appointments and meals for them.",

The verdict is .... it depends. If its a close friend then of course we are there to support our important people (and a close friend of mine would 100% give me a plus one for my partner if not just invite her individually) but my partner made a good point that if its for someone not so close, as it seems to be the case here, then deciding how the money and time spent would effect our co-habitation and family unit would be something she would want  voice in. How much money are we putting into this and what does that mean for bills/savings we have planned, how much time will I be away doing things for the wedding -is it just the day of or is their expectation of bachelor party assisting with set-up and planning etc-, how will the duties effect my energy level when I get back home -will I be stressed out and cranky from the extra tasks, will I be missing stuff we had planned already or not be able to participate in my share of the chores. A lot of families, especially with kids run a tight ship and those kinds of asks for a not so close friend doesn't just effect the husbands life for the duration of the lead up to the wedding.  AND if OP's husband is so easily demoted to a groomsmen, he is not that close to the groom suggesting they really are not all that close.\n\nIf anyone is the asshole, it's the husband for not communicating the details to OP  as he found them out. Especially since there is no \"its a wedding what did you expect\" to it. Not only is it true that second marriages can be smaller back yard affairs but a lot of people on their first marriages these days have small weddings too. On top of that 100+ people and wedding planners is not the norm for a TON of people!",

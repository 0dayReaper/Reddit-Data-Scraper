Was a hot day, someone squirted someone else with a water pistol, I\u2019m sat at the table eating and just observing the water fight from a distance. Water pistols soon escalates to people throwing glasses of water over each other as is usually the way. Im still observing, didn\u2019t particularly want to wet. My friend comes over and squirts a bit of water on my chest. I stand up, he runs off laughing. I go to the kitchen to fill a glass up, I sneak up behind him and soak him, note that he is already wet. I then sit down, water fight dies down, I continue eating. About 5 mins later my friend comes up behind me and pours Coke all over me. I said Wtf, stood up and he just laughed said got you back bro!!!! I said f you idiot, had to leave because I was covered in Coke. \nAnyway, a couple of days later I\u2019m driving to work, I see my friend walking on the street in a shirt and trousers on the way to his teaching job at a college. I decide to pull up behind him, get out and drench him with a bottle of Pepsi I had in the car. Before he could react I\u2019m back in the car and driving off, i just see him sort of wiping Pepsi off his shirt in shock. He text me saying c**t I\u2019m on my way to work. I said i know, lol. Not spoken since.\n\nTldr: friend poured coke on me at a bbq, I saw him on way to his job and poured Pepsi on him.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

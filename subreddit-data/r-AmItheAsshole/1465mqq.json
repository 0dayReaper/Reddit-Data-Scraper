    "postText": "So my gf had bought a skipping rope, i usually do jumps for cardio, so today I decided to try out the skipping rope. At the beginning she was telling that there wouldn't be any space to do skipping in the room and that she had bought it to do it in terrace. I told her I can do it here and the space would be enough, which it was.Then suddenly she got angry and said she bought it for her and I shouldn't be using it. I immediately stopped using it and did just jumping without rope. She was angry at me for the same and we had an argument where i told that if she had mentioned not use in the beginning i wouldn't have. I was just trying out the rope and it is not like use and throw, she got very angry about it. We usually use lot of each other's product, but this came of as a suprise and i felt it was silly to fight about a rope",

Fair enough and seems reasonable.\n\nBut maybe she wanted to be the first one to use her new toy. \n\nI'd suggest that her (over)reaction may be that she feels you overstep boundaries with her/her possessions, and she has been waiting for an opportunity to let you know. You could ask her if that is the case.",

Travel mugs, tote bags, luggage, shampoo, fitness equipment - you name it, the guys think it's theirs if they want it. I bought three large tote bags that were storing my husband's stuff within a couple of weeks after I brought them home.  Hair brushes?  I had to make a big stink to get one all to myself.  Water bottles?  They disappear into his car and aren't seen again for months.\n\nIf that's your routine, you are indeed TA.",

    "postText": "My dad wanted me to request an off day to celebrate his birthday (the same date as Independence Day, July 4). I, 19F, told him I would celebrate after I worked since we only eat out and watch the fireworks afterwards. He then proceeded to make it sound like I cared more about work than celebrating this birthday- which isn't true. I explained to him that since we're going to watch the fireworks at night, we could just celebrate after I come back from work. I then told him I would request to work a morning shift so that I could come home early to celebrate. He still seemed hurt even after I came up with this solution to work and still celebrate. I feel really bad and I didn't want to hurt his feelings.",

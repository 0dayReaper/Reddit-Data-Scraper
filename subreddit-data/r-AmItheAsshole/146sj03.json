Really this becomes about you and what would make you feel most closure about the situation. Some people who are estranged want to have a last visit with the person they are estranged from, others do not. The choice is yours and neither choice is wrong.",

He was and still is an alcoholic. Him and my mum divorced when  me and my siblings were babies. He used to beat my mum and we also seen it and seen him beating our uncle and grandad. When we seen him on Saturdays when we lived near it was spent in a pub all day for him to drink.\n\nNow I've had information that he is in a bad way in hospital and is probably not going to come out alive.  Would I be an asshole for not travelling over 6 hours to see him. BTW he had all our numbers when we moved so could have contacted but never did\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

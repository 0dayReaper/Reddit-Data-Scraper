It\u2019s certainly not fair. I\u2019m honestly also baffled by the responses here when usually with blended families reddit is quick to tell parents sometimes the other side of one kids family gives them more and it\u2019s reality etc\u2026 imagine how much most support the op would be getting if they were the family of a divorced parent, when here it\u2019s so much worse because the dad isn\u2019t there to provide for his daughter. Also I call bs on them doing Emma\u2019s room next year. What, so no holiday next too to cover the cost of Emma\u2019s room? I highly doubt it. I think Emma\u2019s mum is entirely in the wrong to over compensate Kay when, once again, Emma is only getting these things because her dad is dead.",

I just wanted my parents to go each their own way and find happiness, because their misery was making me and my sister miserable as well.",

If one parent is angry or violent or even just very unhappy, there\u2019s no one to protect you or meet your needs. There are fewer resources when a single person has to get housing and food and everything else with only one income. You don\u2019t have the things that make you feel comfortable because you only have half your stuff at any given time. Stuff falls through the cracks because there\u2019s less communication, so you miss shit when you\u2019re with one parent. You become the partner and therapist for your single parents because you\u2019re the only person they have (maybe this is more for only children). I\u2019m just saying that not having the image of a perfect family is not the hardest part of divorce for a kid",

Everyone else knew, but they would send us \"on vacation\" to visit whichever family member didn't mind doing the parenting for them when we were young. \n\nThey divorced when I was 7 and it was a mess. Fighting over dollars, getting us kids in the middle, my mom moved a man into the house the same day we met him, she also didn't show up to a bunch of my events even when she told me she'd come, my dad picking up the pieces but secretly being the reason she felt she couldn't come. As an adult, I've concluded that he's manipulative and she's a cheater.",

If she were lucky, she'd have a great stepfather who steps into that role fully, but judging by what OP posts (which to be fair may not be the full scope of Emma's home life), Kay is going to have top priority in her father's life over Emma, and Emma is going to grow up aware of that.

It wasn\u2019t my fault, or my wishes, but I got punished anyway. I learned to see so I could alter what my gramma sent because the clothes she sent were always 2-3 sizes too big and were clothes an old lady would wear, not a teenager. For example, if I was 12, my gramma bought me size 12 clothes. If I was 14, she bought me size 14, etc. I was small and these clothes dwarfed me, so I had to essentially take them apart and remake them. I never did blame, or resent, my brothers, but It still hurts to think about it.",

Well simply put you decided to take your blood niece on a trip (YOUR BLOOD) and have some family bonding time, but then because you took your own blood relative on a vacation, her mother/step father decide to cancel the anual family vacay to redo kays room, all because you decided you wanted to have some family time. What did they expect you to take kay as well who has 0 relation to you in any way you have no obligations to that mans child and yet it seems like they are trying to make you feel guilty that \u201ckay doesent have a rich aunt\u201d. They could have still gone on vacation they were just being petty I assume kay probably threw a temper tantrum about how she doesent get to goto japan and so they wanted to make her feel better. Again not your blood not your family so to me i dgaf about kays feelings here.",

Hardly a big, established family tradition.  For all anyone knows, the real reason for not going on this trip was financial.  I could sure as heck redecorate my kids room for a lot cheaper than a 1-2 week vacation.  So maybe they wanted to sell the kids on that, and didn't think it was any of the aunt's business that they couldn't afford a big family trip this year.",

But now Emma is upset because she doesn\u2019t get a second, much more modest vacation and her sister\u2019s room gets redecorated first.\n\nDo you think Nancy is being unfair because you don\u2019t believe they will follow through with redecorating Emma\u2019s room next year? Do you feel that Emma is entitled to a second vacation this summer anyway? Even though many parents do family vacations mostly for the kids, and if Kay doesn\u2019t want one and Emma already had one and that money is needed elsewhere, it\u2019s not very logical?",

            "comment": "NTA\n\nOP I don\u2019t think you get to question how your former SIL spends their money.  \n\nHowever what changes it for me in this case is the reason given for doing Kay\u2019s room first apparently was Emma already got a big trip so she could be second as applies to redoing rooms.  \n\nIMO former SIL could have just said instead of doing a trip this year Kay\u2019s room is getting redone this summer and Emma\u2019s the following summer.  But instead she used Emma\u2019s trip to justify the order the rooms would be done in.  \n\nDoes former SIL plan on doing something special for Kay every time you OP do something for Emma?  \n\nSo OP if you take Emma in another trip does that mean Emma doesn\u2019t get her room redone or if the family was going to take a trip then Emma would be left home to keep things even?  \n\nOP I will make a suggestion if you have any assets that you have Emma as the beneficiary in case something happens to you, if you are creating a college fund for Emma or you are leaving anything to Emma in your will please consider making sure with your attorney those funds are protected as in your sister has no access to them.  I\u2019d also suggest any funds be held in trust for your niece until she is 21 with exceptions for possibly paying for Emma\u2019s education with the funds being paid directly to the school. \n\nMy concern is your former SIL if still married to her husband will decide to be fair anything left to Emma be split with Kay. She may even decide that Kay should get a bigger portion because after all Emma had the benefit of having a rich aunt.   At 21 Emma should be strong enough to refuse such a request.",

Also, what does the new dad do for your niece to make her feel welcome in the family? Obviously your former SIL is going out of her way for his daughter. Making her wait a year, when you know then, the excuse will be since we didn\u2019t go on a trip last year, we\u2019ll put off the new room and maybe do it next year. The excuse he doesn\u2019t have money because of his children seems to be just that, an excuse. He\u2019s got another child in the household. If something happens to you, will he still plan on not providing equally for the children. Is he trying to even step up emotionally to a fatherless child? It doesn\u2019t take money for that.",

That\u2019s a little bit of AH but nothing that can\u2019t be apologized for and you should apologize for trying to say your niece is being treated unfairly when she\u2019s getting a lot of help from you that she otherwise wouldn\u2019t be getting. If your niece doesn\u2019t get her room redone that\u2019d be unfair but having to wait til next summer isn\u2019t bad for a family on a budget. Sorry for the loss of you your SIL and niece but hopefully y\u2019all can move forward in a positive way \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

This is in no way depriving Emma of anything. And you did just give Emma an amazing vacation in Japan.\n\nYTA. You could have been supportive of Emma by giving her an ear or a shoulder to vent to. But she is a child and has the perspective of one. You are an adult and should recognize and respect that how your SIL chooses to spend her money is her choice, and I genuinely don't see what's unfair to Emma here.

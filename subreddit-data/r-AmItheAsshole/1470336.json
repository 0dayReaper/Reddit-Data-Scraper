    "postText": "Some background is needed in this story, I (26M) am a white man married to my wife who\u2019s (26F) Pakistani. We have a 2 year old daughter who\u2019s mixed race. When we first dated my wife had to keep our relationship secret for religious reasons and when she fell pregnant she decided the only way forward was to cut all contact and try to hide. My wife had no contact with any family members for nearly 2 years before we were contacted social services contacted us about my SIL(16 then now 20) She had unfortunately been hospitalised a few times because of problems at home and she needed to be removed from the house. My wife convinced me to take her in, I\u2019m a soft man so even though I knew the problems would arise I agreed.\n\nFast forward a year I was forced to move from my apartment that I loved into a new house for extra space. I pretty much spent every penny I had to make saw the house was suitable for everyone including my SIL. I even took out loans to make sure the house was finished. From paint, to carpet to furniture everything payed for by me. You would think all that hard work would earn some respect? Absolutely not\n\nOriginally starting with typical teenager stuff like leaving mess everywhere, mouldy food in the room, general rudeness and aggressive nature. All this I could handle but one moment forced a breaking point. My SIL received an inheritance from a family member passing away, my wife didn\u2019t. As a way to say sorry for her behaviour and say thank you my SIL convinced my wife to let her pay off one of the loans taken out to decorate the house, I hated the idea but my wife agreed.\n\nFast forward 2 months and my wife and SIL had a massive falling out and SIL moved back home, seemed best for everyone, I was finally free. Well not quite. She demanded every penny back from the payed of loan within the month, so I had to take out another loan, with high interest to pay her back because of my poor credit at the time. I had to work every weekend for months to pay back the loan to the point my daughter was asking why daddy was never home anymore. I missed out on so much\n\nFast forward another 2 years and my wife and SIL have made up and she\u2019s getting married. SIL wants us both there as she says we influenced her so much growing up and she saw me as a father figure as her dad passed away when she was young. To cut the story short I refuse to go. Everyone is furious with me including my wife but I can\u2019t move past what she did. I worked constantly to pay back the loan, missing birthdays and holidays for the entire year. Missed key moments in my daughters life. I just can\u2019t forgive. AITA?",

Look at it as a single day in your life, just one more, to keep your wife happy and show that you respect her and her cultural traditions.

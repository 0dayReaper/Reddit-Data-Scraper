But you see,every girlfriends i met i interacted with them more and warmer up to them more compared to my dad (sorry for bad english it\u2019s not my first language) so the first one i was closed with was very dear and important to me which also took me years to move on from, as if i was the one who broken up with her. So back to the story,my dad introduced me to his now ex girlfriend. We interacted at times but i was a bit shy so we dont message much. You see she messaged just now which took my by surprise by saying \u201ctake care of your dad for me\u201d i was confused i asked what happened and she told me they\u2019ve broken up just now. I was in lost of words because ahe and my dad promised me to get a new phone but i dont trust my dad one he\u2019ll get me one since he promised that before. She insisted to buy me a new phone even if she and my dad broken up. I felt bad and told her many times that it\u2019s okay and she dont have to but she really kept insisting and that she prmised that. After that, i told my mom what happened and she told me to refuse the offer even if i did but my dad\u2019s ex kept insisting. She told me i was nothing but a jerk and a materialistic person for accepting it even if i tried so many times and eve asked her why she was always like that to me and wanting me to refuse wvery opportunity i have. I know i was wrong for accepting that but she really kept telling me so many times but if it didn\u2019t happen I\u2019m still very fine with it so AITA?",

            "comment": "This. Your Dad's ex-GF sounds kind to be providing you with a phone. Most 15 year-olds  have one for communication and safety and even for keeping track of their study, work, and social events.\nYour Mom is shockingly abusive in her refusal. If your Mom was concerned that you are a minor and possibly being used, that would be a different situation. Her words and attitude would still be unacceptable.\nI can't see you staying much longer in this abusive home. Take the phone as a tool toward your eventual independence. Be strong. And discrete.\nNTA",

I understand that part but what can i do if my dad\u2019s ex was willing to buy me one and said it\u2019s okay? I just dont get why she thinks I\u2019m being materialistic now even though i refused",

Lots of cultures all over the world are like this. And, maybe, there is some hurt pride on your Mom's part. She does need to be more respectful and patient, however, or she will find herself distanced from her daughter. Be strong. \u2764\ufe0f",

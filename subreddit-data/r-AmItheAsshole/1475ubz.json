It\u2019s roughly 8 hours driving distance from her. I lived there at one point and have had multiple people visit. (I moved back to where I\u2019m from.) \n\nI\u2019ve been aware for a bit that my friend may have liked me romantically but I\u2019m not one to assume things are like that without having a conversation. \n\nWe had a conversation a few months ago exploring the idea but I shut it down. I did not like her more than platonic friends. \n\nSo the day arrives when she gets in town, I help her unload her things and we catch up. Fairly normal first night. \nThe second day rolls around and I can tell she\u2019s all dressed up, but I didn\u2019t pay it much attention. She\u2019s really into fashion, makeup, and I\u2019m just a crusty dude. \n\nAnyway I show her around town, I pay for my meals and let her pay for hers. Same with things at local stores, and eventually the day winds down to and end. We share a few drinks and go to bed. (Separate rooms mind you.) \n\nI wake up the next morning to her crawling into bed with me. To which I\u2019m freaked out. Again, I did not like her. \n\nI got up and walked out of the room immediately. She seemed confused and followed me. \n\nI told her I needed time to figure out what happened and where the miscommunication came from. \n\nTo which she promptly got ready and left. I got a text telling me to take my time. When I decided to ask her to leave. \nI didn\u2019t feel comfortable. \n\nShe then comes back to the apartment and berates me for tricking her. Telling me she has nowhere to go. Saying I\u2019m heartless and begins to talk pretty badly about me.  \n\nShe left with all of her things, I didn\u2019t argue, I just stood firm asking her to leave.  \n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR:\nFriend visited town and thought I had feelings for her. Got in my bed while I was asleep and got angry / aggressive at my rejection of her advances.",

    "postText": "I (25F) have friends, a couple, that moved awhile back to another state because of college, and decided to stay there even after graduating. We keep contact via texting and video calls but we've never seen each other face-to-face since they moved. They decided to travel to the city I live in so we can spend time together. We had all choosen a lot of things to do in the 2 weeks they're supposed to spend here. The conflict is that I don't want them to stay at my aparrment (like, sleep there overnight) while they're here, but they don't have family or other friends in this state or close by that they can stay with which means they'd have to pay for a hotel. A day ago, when they arrived, we were talking and I asked them which hotel they picked. They were confused and Ana (26F) asked what I meant. They thought they were going to stay at my apartment with me. We hadn't discussed where they would stay before they came here, and I assumed they knew they were going to stay at a hotel since they have never stayed at my home like that and they know I don't let anyone stay over like that. Not even my parents or my boyfriend. They said they thought I had changed my mind about these things, but I never said I had, they just assumed I did. I live at an apartment alone and even though there isn't a guest room I have my old mattress that I could put on the living room or on my hobbies's room, or they could sleep on the couch. But I refused to do so and to pay or help pay for the hotel. They're both very annoyed with me and think I'm being selfish but James (25M) is furious. He thinks I am being ridiculous. Ana accepted to pay but James wants to either go back or make me let them stay in my apartment. They're staying at a hotel at the moment and we didn't do what we planned to yesterday. Ana texted me that she's trying to convince James to stay in the hotel, and maybe she will but nonetheless they both think I should change my mind.\n\nThe reason I don't want them, or anyone, to stay over is because it makes me very uncomfortable to have someone in my home while I am asleep or not there. I hate the ideia of someone touching my things without my permission or seeing something I'd rather they not see, or even stealing something. And they know that, but thought I had become more lenient about it.\n\nI asked my parents and other friends what they think and the general consensus is that it would be nice of me to let them stay but since I am know to be quite neurotic between our friends and family and it's not like I told them I changed my view nor implied they would stay, I wouldn't be in the wrong if I don't allow it.",

Shouldn't they just, not assume they have a place to stay for two weeks in the first place? Like you said- two weeks is a wildly long time to plan on staying in someone's home without asking first. Especially if OP works and has a social life. People aren't in the wrong for failing to predict somebody else will deviate from the established norm. If you're currently an established vegetarian and sometime in the distant future I take you to a steakhouse and get angry that you won't eat a steak, that's not your problem. That's my fault for assuming you'd eat steak when you never indicated you would. You shouldn't have to anticipate that I'm going to make that assumption.\n\nTBH- I think OP's friends knew she wouldn't be cool with it, but thought she would just cave. Because 2 weeks at a hotel is a lot of money, and one of the friends seems to want to do it anyway. I personally wouldn't be able to afford that at such short notice. If my friends said I couldn't stay, I'd go back home. I think they planned for this contingency, but fully expected to guilt OP into breaking her boundaries. If this were a genuine misunderstanding, they wouldn\u2019t be calling OP selfish and asking her to pay for their blunder, they\u2019d be embarrassed and apologizing for being so presumptuous.",

I\u2019ve had to work (HARD) at it, but as I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve forced myself to be more willing to have overnight guests (not for 2 weeks, but for a few nights).

This was my best best friend, stood on my side when i got married, held my first born before family did, i trusted him with my LIFE. And he did me wrong. I dont let anyone in my home anymore aside from my parents, my children and small cousins. No friends are ever allowed back period because of it. And i have cameras. \nI dont think shes being unreasonable. At alllll.",

Planning where you will stay is the first step to planning any trip, imo, since it affects the budget and what activities you will do. If someone is coming to visit you, imo the most polite thing to do is to either invite them to stay at your place or apologize for not being able to host them. If I'm visiting someone and they didn't offer either of those things, then I might gently inquire but expect that the anwer is that they can't host me. Also, 2 weeks is well above the length of time that I would feel comfortable inconveniencing anyone except a lover/very close friend.",

When you\u2019re making the arrangements, include something like \u201cthere are a lot of nice hotels near me, do you want me to send you a list or do you prefer to research on your own?\u201d\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have been upset if it had been discussed like that prior to the trip, but after they\u2019ve already arrived, two weeks of hotel costs is probably way over their budget for the trip. So in the future, always talk about hotels before people come to visit.",

If I visited a friend and I found out they had such an attitude, quite frankly I would downgrade them from a friend to a vague acquaintance.

NO.\n\nDoes that mean OP is showing a lack of trust and support when their friends are showing huge efforts to spend time together?

The guests are still in the wrong for not checking whether they were welcome in advance, but I think the fact that they're coming to visit OP, rather than coming to visit the city, puts an additional expectation on the OP that they host. I'd also be interested in exactly whose idea the trip was. If OP said something like 'you should come visit' then I think there's more of an implied invitation there.\n\nOP is NTA because at the end of the day no one is obliged to host people if they don't want to and a bilateral miscommunication doesn't make anyone an asshole, but if I were her I'd maybe work on the whole 'I worry my friends will steal my things while I sleep' thing.",

Usually if someone is visiting you to spend time with you and you agree to spending time with them, it's mostly a given that they'll crash at your place. Or most folks are kind enough and set up some accommodation for that person. \n\nI would say ESH because i think maybe they should have asked directly if this is something you normally do.\n\nEdit : YTA. I'm sorry OP but you mentioned in the replies that you guys talk almost every day. Man if you guys are that close friends that you talk to them everyday, i really think it's not that far fetched of them to assume that they'll stay with you.

They should have asked if they could stay with you.\n\nSince it sounds like you didn't invite them, NTA. I imagine this is an issue of them, particularly James, being embarrassed. They know you don't do guests and didn't ask the obvious question about housing. Maybe because they were hoping you would feel guilty and just give in. Who knows.

I\u2019m baffled that apparently none of the people in these comments would usually expect to stay with friends when you\u2019re travelling far for the main purpose of visiting that friend?? In most cases, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d visit a friend that wouldn\u2019t let me stay with them.",

I think how you handled it afterward makes you a crappy host/friend. Unless I\u2019m understanding this wrong, they traveled TO SEE YOU and when this obstacle came up, you doubled down with being a weirdo.",

How did you all plan a two week trip for this couple to specifically come to see you and amid all of the planning none of you ever brought up where they\u2019d be staying? It\u2019s insane to me that no thought was put into accommodations until they arrived. They suck for assuming you\u2019d host them in your apartment, rather then asking and confirming other options ahead of time. You suck for expecting your friends to shell out a ton of money to stay in a hotel for two weeks for a trip they wouldn\u2019t be making it not for you.",

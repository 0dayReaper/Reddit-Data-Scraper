    "postText": "\n\nI 20f have been with my bf for 4 months now he has a 2 year old child and he\u2019s almost 22. He currently isn\u2019t working but I\u2019m trying to help him get a job so for the past few months we\u2019ve been holding it together with my income from my job. I do work full time &amp; I\u2019m working on getting a 2nd job because I have to help him. \n\nFor context, I got approved for an apartment 6 months ago and when i met him he was coming over at my place a lot, he kept asking for money for finances for his son or for his sons birthday party or for help with his portion of rent at his moms or whatever it was. This caused me to get behind on my rent and so I had to break my lease and move out before I got evicted. I\u2019m currently living with family and trying to get a new apartment by September. \n\nYesterday, my boyfriend asked for $250 and whhe came to get it, he blocked my brothers car in and so they got into a huge argument, and they already don\u2019t like him because they feel he\u2019s using me. The day ended with my bf calling my brother the b word and telling him to \u201cf himself\u201d. My family screamed and yelled at me for \u201callowing him\u201d toTo disrespect them but I told them the way they speak about him, he has a right to defend himself. \n\nI told them I\u2019m never leaving him and he told me he wasn\u2019t going to leave me because of my family. They proceeded to call him a leech and make me out to be the bad guy. Although I am disappointed in his behavior and him making me lose my place, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m the asshole in this situation. I\u2019m not the one who did this. AITA?",

His child his HIS responsibility, not yours. For crying out loud, he caused you to break your lease of your apartment because he kept asking money from you! Your family is right, you boyfriend is using you AND disrespecting you; he instigated the fight with your brother when he blocked your brother's car. OP, you need to take a good look at the big picture. Please break up with him, you can do so much better.",

I had been with him for 2 years at that point amd stayed with him for another year. \n\nThey were right. I knew they were right, but I buried it deep down because I loved him. The unfortunate truth was that he didnt love me, but he did love my ability to give him money, bail him out of debt, put him first and put up with his behaviour towards me.\n\n23yrs later I still have to block him over and over on social media. He has no impact on me any more but my time with him caused a lot of trauma. \n\nMy family and I were never close except for my father and I. So, it wasnt how they felt about me that drove their opinion of him, it was their clear view of how terrible I was being treated. Maybe your family can see something similar? \n\nPlease think how you would feel if you watched your best friends boyfriend talk to your friends family like your boyfriend spoke to yours? Would you be concerned about how he speaks to your friend in private if he speaks to their family like that in public?\n\nPlease take care of yourself",

He's taken advantage of you, financially, to the point where you became homeless and had to move in with them.  \n\nThe fact that you had to move in with them makes it their business, to a certain extent - you're costing them money and privacy.  Your choices regarding him have profoundly affected their lives.\n\nHe ***is*** a leech.  Even now, when you're reduced to living at your parents' place because he's eaten his way through your income and savings, he's still asking for money!\n\nAnd you did choose to give him money, to the point where you could not meet your expenses and responsibilities.  And you're still choosing to give him money, that you need to be setting aside for the deposit on your own apartment if you ever want to get one.  \n\nYou're working two jobs, while he has none.  He has a two year old, and I suspect he isn't meeting his child support responsibilities, unless you're paying.  If you ever have a child with him, expect him to be as reluctant to support that child out of his own pocket as he is at supporting this one - if he gives anything, it's from your money and your work, not his.  \n\nYou need to learn to say \"no\" to him.  \n\nI predict, if you stay with him, he'll only hang around as long as you are keeping him financially afloat.  Cut off the money, and this conman will be looking for a new mark.  And I strongly suspect he won't be faithful to you, as long as he's with you, if he find a second woman whom he can convince to give him more money, he'll be stringing you both along as long as both of you keep your wallets open.\n\nTell him you'll stay with him, but he's getting no money.  Don't take him out your treat, either.  See if he's interested if you aren't handing over the cash. See if he's still hanging around in six months when the money isn't flowing.    \n\nAnd be very, very sure of your birth control.",

He currently isn\u2019t working but I\u2019m trying to help him get a job so for the past few months we\u2019ve been holding it together with my income from my job. I do work full time &amp; I\u2019m working on getting a 2nd job because I have to help him. \n\nFor context, I got approved for an apartment 6 months ago and when i met him he was coming over at my place a lot, he kept asking for money for finances for his son or for his sons birthday party or for help with his portion of rent at his moms or whatever it was. This caused me to get behind on my rent and so I had to break my lease and move out before I got evicted. I\u2019m currently living with family and trying to get a new apartment by September. \n\nYesterday, my boyfriend asked for $250 and whhe came to get it, he blocked my brothers car in and so they got into a huge argument, and they already don\u2019t like him because they feel he\u2019s using me. The day ended with my bf calling my brother the b word and telling him to \u201cf himself\u201d. My family screamed and yelled at me for \u201callowing him\u201d toTo disrespect them but I told them the way they speak about him, he has a right to defend himself. \n\nI told them I\u2019m never leaving him and he told me he wasn\u2019t going to leave me because of my family. They proceeded to call him a leech and make me out to be the bad guy. Although I am disappointed in his behavior and him making me lose my place, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m the asshole in this situation. I\u2019m not the one who did this. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

You've lost your financial independence providing for this guy instead of yourself. Meanwhile, your family has to house you and you continue to support this man you've been with for a very short time and a child who isn't even yours. What I'm reading is that this guy has left you broke and you've allowed him to insult the people who helped you out of a terrible situation that your boyfriend put you in. Do you not see how ridiculous this sounds? Why do you feel responsible for financially supporting your boyfriend when you can't even financially support yourself? If it wasn't for your family you'd probably be homeless because it's obvious that this guy can't even support himself and his kid, much less you. You should try to make amends to your family because 1) they are right: your boyfriend is a leech and 2) if you continue to let him disrespect your family you might find that you don't have anyone to help you out of the financial mess you've let this guy put you into. He's taking advantage of you and it's really sad that you can't see that.",

Is he even trying to get a job or is he just content in the knowledge that you'll give him whatever money he needs, whenever he asks, regardless of how it seems to effect you financially? I think you need to step back for a minute and think about exactly how this relationship is working. What future do you see with this boy? I'd say man, but he doesn't seem to act like one. Look at it from your parents point of view. You've been together for four months and because of him you've already lost your housing and seemingly their respect bc you just give him whatever he wants. I really hope you take a good hard look at the relationship you have with him. Is it worth it?",

It honestly seems like he is only in this relationship for money and a place to stay. It is not your problem if he can't provide for himself and his son. Your relationship with your family is more important than some 4 month relationship. You already had to leave your apartment, because you kept giving him money. \n\nI suggest counting out how much money you gave him since you got together. Has he even given you money back that you gave him? If not that is a huge indicator that he is just using. I highly suggest not to get a second job if the money is just going to go to him. Based off what you said, you were getting a second job to provide for him.\n\nAlso, is this your first relationship? If so don't feel like it is your job to provide for your partner. Especially not for a 4 month relationship. It is only when you have been in a long time relationship or married.\n\nYou are still young I and you seem to be doing well off for yourself. I suggest breaking up with him, and finding someone who will put in just equal amount of love that you do into your relationship.",

            "comment": "Respectfully, you deserve better than this. Let's look at some facts:\n\n* He has a 2 year old, and you are \"helping him look for a job.\" Conclusion: having a 2 year old to care for was not sufficient motivation for him to find a job. \n\n* He kept asking you for money, so much money that you couldn't pay rent. What did he spend that money on? Why is your having safe housing not important to him? Why should you work 2 jobs to help him, when he works zero? \n\n* After you lost your apartment, he showed up at your parents place to ask for money. And he blocked your brother's car in. Conclusion: he is willing to make threats to your family to get money from you. \n\n* He is looking to stay with you and borrow your car, once you get a new place. Conclusion: he has no interest in supporting himself. He prefers to be a user. \n\nYou haven't asked for advice, but a bunch of people have said to cut him loose. That is a great idea. **Why are you working harder to help him, than he is to help himself?**\n\nIf you are not ready to cut him loose, it is time to learn to say NO. NO to requests for money. NO to requests for a key to your apartment. NO to borrowing your car for any reason. NO to buying him groceries or diapers or anything else. Saying NO is good practice for you, and it is also a test. Is he with you for your money? Cut off the money to find out. \n\nIf you can't tell him NO directly, it is absolutely OK to lie in this situation. Examples: \"My grandmother is really sick and I gave her all my money for an expensive medicine.\" \"My parents are mad at me and they are charging me rent, I don't have any money\" \"my work cut my hours.\" \"I got a $500 speeding ticket.\" \"I found a lump in my breast and had to spend $2000 on a mammogram.\" \"My car blew a head gasket.\" \"I am saving up to pay for a college class next year.\"  \n\nAlso, be aware that some guys will use pregnancy as a way to try to keep a woman in a relationship. This includes tampering with birth control or removing condoms. This guy won't get a job to support baby #1, expect the same or worse for baby #2.\n\nYou sound hard working and caring.  I promise that if you dump this guy, you can find one that respects you and is not after your money.",

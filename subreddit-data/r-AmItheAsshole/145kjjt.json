    "postText": "Back in May I came home from college to see my mom/family for Mother\u2019s Day.  \n\nKeep in mind that Im autistic, adopted and my parents struggled to deal with me a lot. I spent a lot of time in trouble, punished, excluded from activities or gifts etc\n\nOne of the families in our neighborhood was close with mine and all their kids were the same ages as us. I\u2019m good friends with the middle two kids from that family. I spent a lot of time at their house as a kid, more as a teenager but only because their mom was so great.  Her youngest is autistic too, more severely than I am. The mom NEVER seemed frustrated or annoyed or anything with her. I was used to my mom talking to other moms about how awful autism is and how hard it was to raise me but this mom didn\u2019t do that. She told me one time that it can be tough, but she tries to remember that it\u2019s a lot tougher for her daughter because she\u2019s the one with the disability. So that stuck with me. \n\nAnyway I\u2019m so comfortable at their house and always love seeing her. There was always a quiet place to go and the mom would sit, talk to me and ask to see my new drawings. She was so relaxed and supportive. I wasn\u2019t the only one there a lot either, she always had extra kids over. One of her older sons friends even lived there a while.\n\nShe didn\u2019t let kids do whatever they wanted, she had rules/consequences but they made sense and she didn\u2019t hit you or scream at you and make you feel like a horrible person if you messed up. \n\nI appreciate everything my parents have done for me, I don\u2019t want to seem ungrateful or like I wished for a different family. \n\nMother\u2019s Day, we celebrated with my mom and did the usual church/lunch/presents thing with her. I wrote a card, got her a nice gift. After that, a couple of my siblings left and Mom put on a movie. I cleaned the kitchen. Then I got texts from my friends I mentioned saying they were in town too. Apparently a lot of the kids we knew were showing up at their mom\u2019s house and it was turning into kind of a fun get together, so they asked if I wanted to join. \n\nI went and it was a whole thing with so many kids I knew growing up that hung out there over the years. There was a jam session in the backyard and we grilled burgers.  So fun, but emotional because everyone was telling stories about this mom and thanking her. \n\nBefore I left, I got one of my new paintings and gave it to my friend\u2019s mom as a Mother\u2019s Day present. She always loved my artwork and was so supportive so it seemed right to me. \n\nMy mom visited that family yesterday, saw my painting hanging and found out when I gave it to the mom. She and my Dad went BALLISTIC. She thinks it\u2019s a slap in the face that I would celebrate another mom on Mother\u2019s Day when she\u2019s the one that went through all the hardship of raising me. \n\nAm I an asshole?  My siblings are divided and I just feel sad about it all now.",

Her big thing with this is that she feels I\u2019m celebrating someone that didn\u2019t have to do any of the hard parts raising me, so she just got to be nice all the time and it feels unfair. I guess I can understand that. But also I saw how she reacted when her kids screwed up and I even messed up over there sometimes too. She\u2019s just different than my Mom.",

            "comment": "NTA at all, my friend. I can see why your mom got jealous, but she's being needlessly territorial IMO. You can celebrate other mothers on Mother's Day. Plus, it's not like you didn't also celebrate with her and get her a nice gift. What you did was sweet and thoughtful. Don't let them try to take that from you. Your parents' insecurity likely comes from a deep-seated place of insecurity and guilt because they see how comfortable you are with your friend's mom and are aware on some level that they could use improvement in certain areas. A healthier response from them would be for them to assess the situation and learn from it. Unfortunately, it's hard for parents' to admit fault and try to learn from these kinds of situations, especially be where their kids are concerned. They're more likely to get defensive and shift blame/guilt to anyone but themselves. It's a frightfully common theme among these types of stories. I hope it gets better. Good luck.",

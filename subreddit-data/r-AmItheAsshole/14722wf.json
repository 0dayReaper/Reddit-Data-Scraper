Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI, 19 female, finished highschool about a month ago (normal age to graduate in my country). Since then, I've been working almost everyday, with occasional 2-3 day breaks which I have been spending at my partner's. We've been together for about a year and are planning to move in together by the end of September this year. We already have an apartment rented from my parent's friend, it just needs a bit of renovation and cleaning which we are doing - my partner is going to move in soon, I am going to join him when I start technical university. \nRecently, my mom got mad at me when I told her I was going to spend the next 5 days with my partner. She said I was getting too comfortable at that apartment and that I was \"running away from home\". When I asked her what I should be doing home then, she just answered \"live here\". As I said, I am working almost everyday and breaks are truly rare for me. Also, my partner will be leaving in about a month to work abroad and won't be coming back to me until late August, when we will be attending a wedding together and spending a week at his place. Then, we will be apart for another few weeks, so I really want to spend as much time with him as I can. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Perhaps she is experiencing sadness at the thought of you no longer being within arm's reach all the time. Or perhaps she is upset that she will no longer have control over your life. I don't know her well enough to say definitively, so I will leave that choice up to you.",

My (24) SO (29) says he has a whole day planned, I show up late to his the night before (he tells me this is why the day didn\u2019t go to plan later on), our anniversary day comes and he mentions going to the museum\u2026 and doing ac*d, but also keeps reminding me his brother is coming down tomorrow and he wants to spend the day with him. (Bare in mind he spent the last week with his family and this is the first time we\u2019re spending time together properly in 3 weeks). \n\nWe end up having a pretty chill day, he cooks brunch, we go to the park, just another day really but it was nice, the sun was out and we were in good spirits. It gets to night time and we decide to go for a walk around the city, see if there are any bars we could go into - I should mention I lost my job a few months back so I\u2019ve been pretty tight on money, so he offered that it was all on him, he also found out he got paid right before we set off. We walk around for about 3 hours, end up talking about some problems in our relationship we want to fix, there were tears, we solved the issues but the air felt off. We didn\u2019t really feel like \u201ccelebrating\u201d anymore. We headed back home and just went to bed. \n\nThe next day he says let\u2019s go to brunch before he sees his brother, I get ready and as I\u2019m finishing off my make up me asks if I could \u201cplease hurry\u201d as he has things to do. We end up getting into a stupid fight because I feel like he\u2019s rushing our morning for his brother even though we have yet to really celebrate our anniversary or spend some time together without arguing, I explode and mention how he did the same thing for Valentine\u2019s Day where he didn\u2019t plan a thing, didn\u2019t show up with a card, flowers, nothing. I brought chocolates, some flowers for him, and got us a reservation at a jazz bar (which I cancelled secretly after he showed up with melted chocolate in a jar talking about \u201cI tried to make mousse\u201d). Long story short, I called him cheap and broke and said if I had money I would have planned a whole day and made sure it happened, not skip around ideas and then blame me for coming late and waking up late the next stay (WHICH HE DID TOO). I\u2019m annoyed. We went to brunch, I got a stomach ache and puked in the toilet, he left to go drink with his brother which we saw a few days ago, and I went home to nap. He wanted to come to mine after his night out but after seeing there\u2019s girls there and wondering why he didn\u2019t invite me along I just didn\u2019t want him around. This really isn\u2019t the way I want to start our new year\u2026 I also know if I bring it up it\u2019ll lead to argument and he\u2019ll say \u201cI\u2019m allowed to spend time with my brother without you there\u201d which is so obvious as I\u2019ve never hung out with them. Or \u201cif you wanted to come you should have just said\u201d which is irrelevant because I was sure it was a boys night out and I wasn\u2019t really waiting for an invitation. It just hurts :/ AITA?",

Maybe I\u2019m the asshole because I didn\u2019t explicitly say I want to spend time with you and your brother? But also this is a weird one because I don\u2019t think I actually wanted to do that\u2026 I just wanted him to want me to be there, I\u2019d want to be there if he wanted me to be there - and I want him to want me to be there.

            "comment": "NAH, I think. There's a lot going on here, but you're allowed to be annoyed that your SO isn't a more elaborate planner. It's a little hypocritical for you to say, \"if I had money, I would have done ___\", but then it's not okay for him to say, \"if I didn't have existing plans with my brother, I would have done ___.\" But it's okay to be annoyed that you don't have the money to spend on him like you wish you did.\n\nIf I understand all this, his brother was planning on coming down on your anniversary, so he planned to make your anniversary festivities the day before. You went ahead and did those activities, but then you both decided to call it early, because you had a meaningful conversation. That sounds fine - he has nothing to \"make up for\".  Nevertheless, you made last minute brunch plans together for the next day, and he told you that he was on a time crunch for meeting with your brother. Obviously, you wanted to get all dressed up because you were sorta seeing this as making up for your anniversary, but alas, you didn't have the time, and he told you that.\n\nYou both seem to be trying your best. You could communicate better. Maybe try laying off the ac*d - that can't be helping.",

And I hope he'll be forgiving to you, knowing you're in a tough situation right now. If either of you find that difficult, that means you need to learn more about each other. I know anniversaries can feel really important to your relationship, but remember that an anniversary is just a day to acknowledge what your relationship has been so far. It's not about the day-of.\n\nThat conversation the night before your anniversary? *That's* what relationships are built on, and you should be so proud of yourself for having it. Keep it up. And also, maybe stop with the ac*d.",

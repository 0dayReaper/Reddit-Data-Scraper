    "postText": "i\u2019m writing this angry and upset. my boyfriend and i have been together for a year. we\u2019ve had our ups and downs but have overall been really good. today i asked my boyfriend if he would like to go out with his little cousin let\u2019s call him jack. Jacks a year younger than us and we are good friends because of my boyfriend. i had been snapping him on snap back and forth of course only friendly stuff and selfies ( just general snapchat stuff). and he kept talking about how he wanted me and my boyfriend to go out with him. So today we all planned to take a walk over the field and the park since it\u2019s a hot day and we all wanted to get out the house before I got ready to leave. I was sorting through my clothes and found an old long tank top. I cropped the shirt to kinda salvage it and with the remaining piece of waist fabric that was on there I put it around my hips like a pretend miniskirt the skirt was ridiculously short and never something i would ever wear out. I sent the video of me wearing the \u201coutfit\u201d. to my friends and boyfriend saying in the video, how I really like this outfit clearly being sarcastic. Well I get a reply from my boyfriend that says you really think you\u2019re wearing that to go out and see my cousin who do you think you are I am immediately told him that it was a joke and explain the whole situation, but he\u2019s just ignoring me. I\u2019ve called him about 20 times for him to just keep hanging up on me and I think he\u2019s blocked me all over a stupid joke I told him that I wouldn\u2019t even wear that in general allowed to go out and see his cousin. Hu, by the way I have no interest in and he has no reason not to trust me. I just cancelled going out, told his cousin that I wasn\u2019t going to go out because my boyfriend was kicking off and he\u2019s still not replying to me, so I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the asshole in all of this.",

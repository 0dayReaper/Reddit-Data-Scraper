    "postText": "(Buckle up) So it\u2019s been one year together. My (24) SO (29) says he has a whole day planned, I show up late to his the night before (he tells me this is why the day didn\u2019t go to plan later on), our anniversary day comes and he mentions going to the museum\u2026 and doing ac*d, but also keeps reminding me his brother is coming down tomorrow and he wants to spend the day with him. (Bare in mind he spent the last week with his family and this is the first time we\u2019re spending time together properly in 3 weeks). \n\nWe end up having a pretty chill day, he cooks brunch, we go to the park, just another day really but it was nice, the sun was out and we were in good spirits. It gets to night time and we decide to go for a walk around the city, see if there are any bars we could go into - I should mention I lost my job a few months back so I\u2019ve been pretty tight on money, so he offered that it was all on him, he also found out he got paid right before we set off. We walk around for about 3 hours, end up talking about some problems in our relationship we want to fix, there were tears, we solved the issues but the air felt off. We didn\u2019t really feel like \u201ccelebrating\u201d anymore. We headed back home and just went to bed. \n\nThe next day he says let\u2019s go to brunch before he sees his brother, I get ready and as I\u2019m finishing off my make up me asks if I could \u201cplease hurry\u201d as he has things to do. We end up getting into a stupid fight because I feel like he\u2019s rushing our morning for his brother even though we have yet to really celebrate our anniversary or spend some time together without arguing, I explode and mention how he did the same thing for Valentine\u2019s Day where he didn\u2019t plan a thing, didn\u2019t show up with a card, flowers, nothing. I brought chocolates, some flowers for him, and got us a reservation at a jazz bar (which I cancelled secretly after he showed up with melted chocolate in a jar talking about \u201cI tried to make mousse\u201d). Long story short, I called him cheap and broke and said if I had money I would have planned a whole day and made sure it happened, not skip around ideas and then blame me for coming late and waking up late the next stay (WHICH HE DID TOO). I\u2019m annoyed. We went to brunch, I got a stomach ache and puked in the toilet, he left to go drink with his brother which we saw a few days ago, and I went home to nap. He wanted to come to mine after his night out but after seeing there\u2019s girls there and wondering why he didn\u2019t invite me along I just didn\u2019t want him around. This really isn\u2019t the way I want to start our new year\u2026 I also know if I bring it up it\u2019ll lead to argument and he\u2019ll say \u201cI\u2019m allowed to spend time with my brother without you there\u201d which is so obvious as I\u2019ve never hung out with them. Or \u201cif you wanted to come you should have just said\u201d which is irrelevant because I was sure it was a boys night out and I wasn\u2019t really waiting for an invitation. It just hurts :/ AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: The brunch was lovely and I\u2019m glad we went instead of ending the time we spent together with an argument, I apologies profusely for the \u201ccheap and broke\u201d comment and he understood I was splitting at that moment as I walked out (I realised how ridiculously intense that was and came back to apologise). I love him and he\u2019s a great person, he just does this thing a lot where he\u2019ll say he\u2019ll do something\u2026 and then we don\u2019t.. also should he have maybe invited me out to chill with his brother and their friends?",

You were together at that time, either of you could have made the day special regardless of having money or not.\n\n4.

            "comment": "ESH - he said he planned a whole day for you and then everything apparently hit the fan because you showed up a little bit late the night before and both slept in...? It sounds like he either didn't really have anything special planned or just didn't care enough to do more than the usual. Even if he says that he planned the whole day out, it doesn't necessarily mean that he planned anything super special or beyond the ordinary for you though, but I get being disappointed since this is your first anniversary and it says the stage for what's to come which doesn't sound like much.\n\nHowever, it doesn't sound like you did much of anything on your end either, and it also doesn't sound like you communicated what you would want your anniversary to look like. I know that you said you lost your job, but at the same time you don't necessarily have to buy something in order to try and make the day special or do something nice for him. At least, there was nothing mentioned in your post about what you did for the day.\n\nOverall, I think the two of you just need to work on your communication. If you're not going to be open and honest with each other about what you want for different things, then you're just going to end up doing the same things every time and feeling disappointed if you had wanted more.",

I would also have assumed that since everything was the next day that it shouldn't really matter if I happen to show up a bit late and sometimes it's all beyond our control. Even being late, he could have set an alarm for the proper time to get up or adjusted by like an hour maybe but it sounds like he just immediately gave up on whatever else he may have had planned. That part is completely on him.",

My (24) SO (29) says he has a whole day planned, I show up late to his the night before (he tells me this is why the day didn\u2019t go to plan later on), our anniversary day comes and he mentions going to the museum\u2026 and doing ac*d, but also keeps reminding me his brother is coming down tomorrow and he wants to spend the day with him. (Bare in mind he spent the last week with his family and this is the first time we\u2019re spending time together properly in 3 weeks). \n\nWe end up having a pretty chill day, he cooks brunch, we go to the park, just another day really but it was nice, the sun was out and we were in good spirits. It gets to night time and we decide to go for a walk around the city, see if there are any bars we could go into - I should mention I lost my job a few months back so I\u2019ve been pretty tight on money, so he offered that it was all on him, he also found out he got paid right before we set off. We walk around for about 3 hours, end up talking about some problems in our relationship we want to fix, there were tears, we solved the issues but the air felt off. We didn\u2019t really feel like \u201ccelebrating\u201d anymore. We headed back home and just went to bed. \n\nThe next day he says let\u2019s go to brunch before he sees his brother, I get ready and as I\u2019m finishing off my make up me asks if I could \u201cplease hurry\u201d as he has things to do. We end up getting into a stupid fight because I feel like he\u2019s rushing our morning for his brother even though we have yet to really celebrate our anniversary or spend some time together without arguing, I explode and mention how he did the same thing for Valentine\u2019s Day where he didn\u2019t plan a thing, didn\u2019t show up with a card, flowers, nothing. I brought chocolates, some flowers for him, and got us a reservation at a jazz bar (which I cancelled secretly after he showed up with melted chocolate in a jar talking about \u201cI tried to make mousse\u201d). Long story short, I called him cheap and broke and said if I had money I would have planned a whole day and made sure it happened, not skip around ideas and then blame me for coming late and waking up late the next stay (WHICH HE DID TOO). I\u2019m annoyed. We went to brunch, I got a stomach ache and puked in the toilet, he left to go drink with his brother which we saw a few days ago, and I went home to nap. He wanted to come to mine after his night out but after seeing there\u2019s girls there and wondering why he didn\u2019t invite me along I just didn\u2019t want him around. This really isn\u2019t the way I want to start our new year\u2026 I also know if I bring it up it\u2019ll lead to argument and he\u2019ll say \u201cI\u2019m allowed to spend time with my brother without you there\u201d which is so obvious as I\u2019ve never hung out with them. Or \u201cif you wanted to come you should have just said\u201d which is irrelevant because I was sure it was a boys night out and I wasn\u2019t really waiting for an invitation. It just hurts :/ AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She has to provide proof of working for 8 weeks before being eligible. For some background, I moved out of my mom's a little over two months ago due to a conflict I won't get into. We haven't really had the best relationship in a few years now, and I only moved back in with her about 3-4 months prior(it was meant to be for a visit, but I ended up staying). Before that, I had left her house about 2 years ago because I was babysitting my little brother, and I felt underappreciated. Frankly, that situation negatively impacted my mental health, and I had to leave for my own well-being. If I refuse to help her now, I know that is a little selfish, and I know she really needs this job. I want her to be able to keep the job and keep the house she recently moved into, but I just don't know if I can mentally handle it. I feel selfish for choosing myself, and I know they're really wanting to rely on me, but I also feel like they should've planned better instead of relying on their child who still hasn't really gotten to start their life. I don't want to seem bitter because of how they've wronged me, but I just personally don't think I can do this. I know she needs the help though, which really makes this hard.",

It is nice to help others when you can but not if it destroys your ability to care for yourself. \n\nPerhaps there is an alternative. If you truly wish to babysit for her, and are able to take the time to do so, why would you have to move in? Could you come to her house, watch your brother until she comes home, and leave?",

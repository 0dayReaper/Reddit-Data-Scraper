SO;\n\n* Do you suck it up and be a major part of their life trying to break the cycle as you have done for yourself?\n* Do you give up your life to dedicate to them?\n* Do you keep doing what you are doing on weekends and such until you get burned out?\n\nOR, do you shut out that side of your family altogether.\n\nI really do feel for you and its not right to put this situation on your lap like this. Although I dont normally cross the line of empathy to sympathy, if its not an issue I would like to find out how this turns out.\n\nGOOD LUCK",

Freshman year my mom( 38f) had a baby and I was forced to watch him for from March until august when I started away school. Okay fast forward I come home for about 3-4 days every month and I\u2019m exhausted the school assigns a lot of school work and now I\u2019m still forced to babysit constantly. Then my mom gets pregnant again. Then we find out that my dad(40m) has an estranged daughter (7f) so now I\u2019m forced to babysit her and the baby. \n\nWe have this huge argument about what I am doing for the summer, because I found out that my grandma has a terminal illness and I want to spend as much time with her as I can. My mom freaks out and complains \u201cwho is supposed to help me when I give birth\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re abandoning me\u201d and so on. I end up staying with my grandma, but also repairing my relationship with my mom. \n\nI\u2019m back at school and now every time I come back I\u2019m watching all 3 kids. So things in household do not go over well with the 7f because our dad ends up beating her over something so I called cps. They did an investigation, the only thing to come of it was that they weren\u2019t allowed to leave her home alone or alone with the babies any more. \n\nSo fast forward to this current summer my mom decided that she wants to leave my dad, since I\u2019m home all day I start packing. I ask my mom \u201care you sure\u201d this that and the third bc I\u2019m throwing out a lot of things. She says she\u2019s sure so we move to a state about 10 hours away. I leave a lot behind just because we can\u2019t fit it. \n\nNow my dad came to the state and him and my mom have a facilitated intervention. And decide that my mom is moving back. I know crazy for she moves to a state for 2ish weeks just to go back. Mind you I packed and loaded everything for her and the kids. I took care of them the entire car ride down. So now that she\u2019s moving back I don\u2019t wanna help her I\u2019m tired of baby sitting, I\u2019m so freaking tired. The entire 2 weeks I was watching toddlers all day one even sleeps with me. I\u2019m tired. If I don\u2019t I think it\u2019s gonna escalate to me just moving out bc I can\u2019t deal with it anymore.\n\n\nHere is where I might be the A-hole:\n\nI don\u2019t want to help my mom travel back home with 2 toddlers even though I know it will be very difficult.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Bottom line, you are being abused by your parents-they are forcing you to care for your siblings which are not your responsibility. \n\nUnfortunately, at 16 years old you have limited options:\n\n* Can you live with another family member?\n\n* Can you call CPS for yourself? Inform them of how your mother is forcing you to care for your siblings. \n\n* Accept that you may be stuck until you are 18 years old &amp; can leave. But start planning now. Get a job and hide your money from your parents. If possible, get a scholarship to a college. Find your legal documents-birth certificate, social security, etc and hide them until you are ready to leave. Have an escape plan in place and leave immediately when you are 18. \n\nYou deserve better parents. They need to stop having kids and dumping them on you. \n\nGood luck OP-I wish you the best.

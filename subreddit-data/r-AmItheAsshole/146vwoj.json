    "postText": "A few weeks ago my girlfriend and I got a cat, with the full consent of my flatmate, whom has also been my close friend since my High School days.   \n\n\nAfter getting the cat, he said he wanted to bring his friends over (who me and my gf really don't like), and we said that he can as usual, but if I'm not there he has to keep the cat in my room. We had a huge argument over it as I was being 'super disrespectful', and I eventually yielded to him, and the cat can roam around as usual when his friends are over at our flat, except when they are drinking and partying.  \n\n\nAnyways, all is going fine, but one day I come back from my uni classes to find he has invited a whole host of people, including his friends brother (which is totally random), to show off my cat. I tell him my cat is not a show off piece, and he can't just bring over his friend's to show off the cat like its a petting zoo.  \n\n\nHe says I am being unfair, and since the cat is in the shared space he is entitled to bring his friends over to show off the cat, and that the cat enjoys the company, even though it is my cat, and he can't just show off my cat. I gave him the analogy that if he had a pet hamster, I wouldn't just bring my random ass friend's over to show off his pet. But he was insistent, and that the cat enjoys the company and it is not my place to decide, cuz the cat is in the \"shared\" space. (worth noting he contributes nothing to the cat either).  \n\n\nMy GF and I are sick of his demanding attitude, especially since he keeps insulting us, and does a whole slew of other things, so I have told him I am moving out of the flat, and finding my own place for the cat and my GF cuz I can't stand his attitude.  \n\nIf I kept the cat locked in my room he would no longer consent to the cat in our flat as he believes it\u2019s cruel, and rat me out to the accommodation as we aren\u2019t allowed pets; so either he can act like he owns the cat as well, or I have to move out.\n\n\nAm I the asshole by being controlling to who the cat can see and threatening to move out?",

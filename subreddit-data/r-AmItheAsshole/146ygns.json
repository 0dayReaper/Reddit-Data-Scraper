Flat out tell the man he isn't invited and tell him why.  If he doesn't like it thats his own problem.  Your husband needs to be the one to lay this out with his father though, not you.  If MIL has no spine, then hubby had better.",

His mother is an adult - the adultiest of the adults in this situation, meaning she should be the one fighting that fight.  As an adult nobody can control her situation but her.  If she refuses to help herself over \"peace\" and your husband feels the same, then who is protecting your child but you?  Do you want to stay in a life like this?  I'm assuming you don't want to end your relationship, so let's be logical.  FIL has to be told and placed at arm's length.  How he feels should NEVER trump the needs and comfort of your own child.",

They don\u2019t really love each other anymore but he\u2019s used to her being around and she isn\u2019t able to get a divorce because she\u2019s the type of person who\u2019d rather suffer than make others sad. She doesn\u2019t even wanna spend time with him herself. \nMy husband and his mom have a tight bond though and now that we\u2019re expecting a baby (40 weeks pregnant currently) we\u2019re all pretty excited. We would love to spend some time with my MIL but I honestly don\u2019t want FIL to be there. This has a few reasons but honestly he\u2019s just not nice to be around. He constantly complains about everything we do, is unfriendly, makes uncalled for comments and just takes the fun out of everything. No one can do anything right in his opinion. (I already made posts talking about him)\n\nThe problem there is that MIL doesn\u2019t wanna lie to him and say that she\u2019s doing something with a friend for example so that her, my hubby and me can spend time without FIL. She also doesn\u2019t want to tell him that he\u2019s not welcome because she doesn\u2019t want him to be sad even tho none of us want him there. So what ends up happening is that we can\u2019t spend time with her if we don\u2019t want FIL to tag along.\nTechnically my husband and his mom wouldn\u2019t mind him being there every once in a while as they\u2019re \u201eused to his childish behavior\u201c but I don\u2019t want him to be there. (I\u2018m a very honest person and I say if I don\u2019t like a comment he made so then he gets mad and doesn\u2019t speak like a literal toddler.)\n\nSo technically I\u2019m the only thing here that prevents us four from doing something together because I simply can\u2019t stand him.\nAITA for this? I know MIL wants to spend time with hubby and me but I just think it\u2019s her husband and she should handle this so that we don\u2019t have to suffer from him being around us.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I honestly don\u2019t think it\u2019s silly because neither my husband, his mom or me want to spend time with FIL. I\u2018m simply the only one who\u2019s not ready to spend time with someone I don\u2019t like and actually go through with it. Some people may be able to do that but I don\u2019t wanna ruin my day with someone who complains about every little thing we say/do. I\u2018m really sad that my MIL has to go through life with an idiot like him (her words) but it\u2019s not my responsibility to endure him just bc she doesn\u2019t wanna hurt his feelings by saying that he\u2019s no fun.",

Yeah, the fact that you haven't seen that they're doing that by the way, leaves me to wonder why you're so blind. They aren't just choosing her husband over your fiance, they are literally choosing her over you; they want to keep her and her husband happy and they don't care what that means for you or your fiance.\n\nAnd then you stayed?! You stayed at this party and made small talk and joked around and laughed and made like everything was perfectly fine knowing they had purposely excluded him? Why wouldn't he be upset with you?\n\nEdit for spelling.",

Same as the BIL. Being the bigger person in these situations means basically being a doormat. You back down and essentially agree to tolerate the abusive behaviour to keep the peace while the narcissist smirks that they got away with it and continues their behaviour. The BIL never apologised and in fact doubled down on his abuse when called out. Saying he was the bigger person for reaching out implies it was good he reached out when in reality it just encourages more bullying behaviour.",

Your BIL ( you called him your sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9e in your last post) was constantly bullying, badgering and insulting your now fianc\u00e9 until he had enough and tried to talk to your BIL Man to man and in private about it after being called an idiot. Your family felt that your family should have been involved in settling the dispute instead of your fianc\u00e9 handling it like a mature adult would. Your father and your family have obviously taken your BIL\u2019s side because well, they\u2019re obviously as mature as your BIL.   \n\nYOU, although feigning ignorance about the nature of the feud, ask your boyfriend to extend an olive branch prior to a family party which you fully intend to attend with or without your fianc\u00e9 because it would upset your immature family. He does so and is ignored. And \u201c all and all it was a good night \u201c even though your fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t invited and wasn\u2019t there. How was it a good night? \n\nWow!! By going you reinforced your family\u2019s horrible behavior towards your fianc\u00e9 and if I were him I would run from you and your family. You did not support him and you showed your true colors.

The topic is important info which can mean the difference between your fianc\u00e9 being rightfully hurt and being an irrational hothead.    \n   \nEdit: yeah gotta go with YTA here. Based on this post and your previous one, your fianc\u00e9 is consistently disrespected by your family in favor of BIL, and instead of staying as a united front with him, you switched over to saying that he needs to be the bigger person and accepting that BIL was invited to the party while your fianc\u00e9 wasn't.",

Your parents were absolutely wrong to invite the guy who was in the wrong, who insulted your fiance, and who is rejecting an olive branch (which your fiance was incredibly accommodating to offer).  You should have said something.\n\nSometimes doing the right thing is stressful.  You do it anyway.  At least you should.\n\nYour fiance has every right to be hurt and pretty damned angry over all this.  If I were him, I'd be asking myself some serious questions about whether I wanted a relationship with someone who didn't support me when I was in the right because that would stress her family.  I would be giving serious thought to breaking up with you.  \n\nYTA",

After the first argument, you just sat back and allowed your sister and bil to make terrible remarks about your BF.\n\n\n2. Then your BF sets a boundary. He wasn't in the wrong. He was wronged, and he was verbally abused, insulted, and bullied, and you asked HIM to apologize? You had the victim reach out to their abuser for the sake of family peace? You BF was ostracized and denigrated simply bc he was tired of being mocked. You told him to be the bigger person??? Are you kidding me, I would've told you about yourself right then and there, but this wonderful person did it, he reached out, was the bigger person (despite the fact that from the begging he was the biggest person) he tried to make peace and was ignored\n.\n\n3. Then you find out that despite all your BF being the one to make any/all the efforts to do the right thing, he was excluded by your family. meanwhile, BIl, who started it all and did nothing to fix it, was welcome with open arms? You see this and you stay, me personally I would've confronted my family right then and there, at the very least you should've left, but instead you stayed and made small talk with the people who rejected your husband for doing nothing wrong. I've cut people off for less, but this this is worth going NC/LC, not only do they not care about your BF, but they clearly don't care about you, they picked your sister over you as well and you don't even realize it. \n\n\nYou are terrible. You do not deserve this man, and you are not mature enough to get married. You didn't have his back. You forced him to apologize for nothing. You have consistently shown that you will not stand up for him, and you will choose your family over him every time. YTA, you and your whole family sucks and I hope your BF finds someone better.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo my fianc\u00e9 and BIL had an argument a few months ago that became bigger than needed. My fianc\u00e9 was totally in the right. Since then it has been stressful for my parents because they don\u2019t like to be in the same place at the same time. \n\nA few days ago we had a party at my parent\u2019s home and my mum wanted to invite both of them but my dad was stressing over how both my fianc\u00e9 and BIL will reject the invitation and how it\u2019s gotten so bad. \n\nI talked to my fianc\u00e9 about how Dad has been so stressed lately and if he\u2019d be the bigger person to reach out to BIL and sort it out. He hesitated but agreed saying \u201cOnly for your parents\u201d.He reached out to BIL by calling first which he didn\u2019t pick up and then my fianc\u00e9 wrote a whole text about how they should just try to put a smile for everyone\u2019s sake and be civil even if they\u2019re not going to the best of friends or anything. My BIL read the text but never replied. My fianc\u00e9 waited 24 hours after his text was seen, then deleted BIL\u2019s number and told me he was done trying to make up even if BIL comes to him now.\n\nThe evening of the party comes and I find out that BIL has been invited along with his whole family and is there while my fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t. All in all, it was a good night. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 found out about it and has been extremely angry since then. He\u2019s saying that not only did I make him reach out to the guy who insulted him a few months ago but also my parents showed favouritism by inviting him regardless and not inviting my fianc\u00e9. \n\nHe has never been this angry or shown this much anger towards me. He\u2019s saying he\u2019s not even sure where he wants to go from here. \n\nMy best friend is saying that it was an AH move for me to stay and continue to enjoy drinks at the party but I don\u2019t think my not going to the party or asking him to extend an olive branch was wrong. \n\nSo tell me, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:  Asked my boyfriend to make peace with my brother-in-law for my parents' sake. Fiance tried but got ignored. Fiance was then not invited to a family party but brother-in-law was. Now fiance is upset. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'd venture to say that because one guy is already married into the family and the other isn't, the decision was made to prevent any sort of situation from arising or heavy tension when all are present. Also, do your parents know that fiance reached out to BIL?\n\nI don't think you're the AH for asking, and I don't think he's an AH for feeling the way that he does. And whether or not he decides to marry, that's between the two of you.",

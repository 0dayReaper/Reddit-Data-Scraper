My grandma doesn't stay with us but my mom asked her to stay with us for a month. Let me tell you something about my grandma. she is not the sweet little old granny to us mostly me. She hates me if I do something even slightly wrong she would report it to my dad immediately. I tried a lot to get her to like me when I was young but nothing make her want to love me. Oh and it also doesn't help that she wanted a grandson but got me.\n\n\n\nSo she came to stay with us and we gave her my room and I stayed in with my older sister. Whole month went without any major thing happening.\n\n\n\nBut the day my sister left i was minding my own business still staying in her room cause even after the month ended my grandma wasn't leaving. That afternoon I took a nap after having lunch. All of a sudden my grandma barge in to the room with her belongings and started making room for her in the bed. I asked her what she was doing and she said if had any problem if she stays with me. I said yes I want to be alone (now I know I should have been more polite but I just woke from a nap). She left as soon as I said it and then I hear she's telling my dad about it in the other room. And I knew it's gonna be bad now. My dad came just after she finished her rambling story and asked me \"what the hell did you do\" with a very angry expression and I I didn't know what to say. (Grandma left after a week or so and she is taked to me how normally we speak)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, It's been a few weeks dad is not talking to me even ignoring my presence and not even eating with me. My mom thinks he is being too much and said dad wants me to ask for forgiveness from grandma but still won't talk to me.\n\n\n\n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

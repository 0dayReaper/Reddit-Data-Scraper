    "postText": "My (26F) dad passed away a few months ago. He and my mother were divorced, and his second wife passed away a couple of years ago, so I was the sole beneficiary of his will. Among his possessions was a painting which was chosen by his late wife to decorate their marital home, it was something of a wedding celebration present. His wife didn't work, my father bought the painting, the paperwork was all in his name etc. so it was included as part of his estate.   \n\nHis late wife had a daughter, \"Ellie\" (27F). Ellie contacted me some time ago asking if there was any way I would consider letting her have the painting since her mother loved it so much and it had sentimental value to her. I was a little suspicious of this because if this was the case, surely she could have asked my father for it after her mother's passing, but nevertheless I considered it. The piece is worth - by most standards - a lot of money and it's beautiful, so I wasn't pleased to part with it but since I never planned to sell it and it was not a piece that held any special significance to me amongst my father's collection, I decided I would gift it to her. I let her know I would make the arrangements to have it shipped, and straighten out all the paperwork.  \n\nAbout a week ago, I got a call from a friend of mine, who works at the gallery where my father purchased a lot of his art (she was his dealer, that is how we became friends). She let me know that Ellie had contacted her, looking for a valuation and information on selling the artwork that I was going to give her. My friend called me because she didn't know who Ellie was, but she knew the piece belonged to my father and it is one of a kind, so she was concerned about someone trying to fence it. This made me feel like a complete idiot, because I thought I was gifting Ellie what she considered a piece of her mother, to essentially gifting her a large sum of money got by subterfuge. I called Ellie to ask her what was going on and she reluctantly confirmed that she was planning to sell it. I said I wouldn't feel good about giving her one of my father's possessions just so she can sell it (especially after being lied to) and she said that was none of my business, and I should give it to her anyway since that money would mean more to her than the painting ever had to me.  \n\nEveryone I've asked for advice on what to do has some skin in the game, so to speak, so I just want an outside opinion. AITA for not giving her the painting?\n\nEDIT- everyone is asking if Ellie got any inheritance from her mother. She received her mother\u2019s small life insurance policy, and all her mother\u2019s personal belongings.",

They lived on a house on top of a hill in AN ESTATE. They went on 4 weeks of vacation a year with family. Rented entire mansions on beaches for weeks at a time. But since they went to uni and lived in a sharehouse in their 20s they were all \"I'm lower middle class, maybe middle!\"\n\nAnd I started to show them MY childhood. I would say I was lower middle but stats say I was lower. So probably lower. Poor folk always seem to think they're higher class, just an observation really. I would talk about how I stole food to eat, or how we skipped from home to home 11 times in my youth because of rent hikes. How I still felt blessed and middle class because most weeks we had food. Not all weeks, but most... And that was a lot more than some of my friends had. I had hot water. I was so rich!!!!\n\nI literally a few weeks ago asked my partner \"hey what do middle class people do for fun anyway?\" since I got a middle class job now and have no idea what to do with it. Imagine my shock when my joke question had REAL answers. Gold class movies, brunch on Sundays at the bakery, art supplies (and partners mama don't skimp here!) and parks, drives through the country including meals and toys.\n\nI was like oh... Oh..... People with money really do different things.",

But to me, having financial security is just as fantastical as being a billionaire so it means the same thing by my standards. I'm uncomfortable if I have to spend over $20 on a single item whereas they would be quite \"comfortable\" with that. But it still always irked me a little that they'd say they're not rich. Like, you have an in-ground pool, a built in hot tub,  a theater room, a finished basement with a living room and rec room with a pool table and an office, 4 bedrooms upstairs  a giant kitchen, a sitting room and a living room, 4 luxury cars, in an area where a small, one level house is already like $2 million dollars and you're telling me you're not rich? I mean, after spending all that money, maybe they're not anymore, but at one point they had that money to be able to spend, even as a loan, so they're still rich.",

Stopping working would be a really bad idea unless you want to move to an extremely low cost of living area. Because that's &lt;$50k/yr if you live into your 80's. \n\nBank away what you can into retirement and investments even when you're young. Even if it's a couple bucks a month.

My family has self-made millionaires and all of them would see that as a ***weighty*** investment in a singular object. It could be due to language but your evaluation of the painting's worth to the average person does come off as a bit... blas\u00e9? I've seen family have  quite substantial bills and investments but the difference between a 100k business investment and 100k luxury spending are *extremely* different. My family is rather conservative -- they were born extremely poor and built themselves up -- but I do think that's something worth mentioning. \n\nIt's very shady the way your former step-sister tried to go about this - it's very sad she decided to lie. If she wanted an evaluation for insurance reasons, that's one thing, but she admitted that she didn't intent to actually keep it. Do with the painting what you want, it's yours. \n\nYou have my condolences for the loss of your father; nothing replaces the loss of a loved one. :(",

It was a gift from who to who?\n\nMy point in the question is that if it was a gift to your father, you are clearly NTA.\n\nHowever, in my opinion from ethical/moral standpoint (not legal one), if it was a gift to the late wife, it should had been gifted to her Daughter in inherithance. If it was a gift to both your father and wife, at least half ownership or equivalent money should be given to her daughter. In that case, I would say ESH. Her for lying, you for solely deciding what she can or can't do with a present given to her late mother.",

So they picked it out together. He paid for it, it sat in the house he owned, he paid for its insurance etc. He didn\u2019t gift it to her like it had her name on it.

But he didn't.\n\nI think it's insane you think OP should give a very valuable painting to her father's late wife's daughter Ellie, because it was a \"present\". Ellie doesn't care about the emotional value of the gift (OP's father loving his wife), but she just wants to cash 100k.",

And your father decided not to provide for his step-daughter while leaving you, his only child, with an estate that's clearly sufficiently large that you can file away a highly valuable painting and not bother to sell it even though you don't plan to display it and it has no sentimental value to you?  Is all this correct?\n\nYou are NTA, but depending on how long your father and his late wife were married, and maybe also her age, it sounds like your dad could have been more considerate of her circumstances.  It's shitty the way Ellie approached this, but not surprising she would be frustrated not to be participating in the estate.  If your father had pre-deceased his wife, would he have provided anything for his widow's support?  My guess is yes.  My guess is that in fact the wife would have depended on that and also would have done what she could to help take care of her daughter thereafter (even understanding the main inheritance would go to you).\n\nThere's a fine line here between gold-digging and making yourself financially dependent on someone you're marrying and trusting them to keep you financially secure, come what may.  While this doesn't necessarily extend as an obligation to treat their children as your own, it doesn't absolve you from any responsibility to them whatsoever. \n\nIf you're financially as squared away as you seem to be, and Ellie is not, you might consider making some accommodation to her, while also making clear that closes the issue permanently.",

So they spent a decent amount of time together and unless the step sister bullied OP then I just feel like it's kind of cruel to have so much and leave the sister so little. \n\nIt's not like the sister is demanding half of anything. OP gets property and all the money. The step sister basically got nothing from the man who was in her life for over 10 years. Which must hurt. \n\nOP clearly has more than enough and then some. And doesn't even particularly love the painting. So I just don't get why they couldn't give their sister something.\n\nAlso OP is a female not a male",

Since you have told us that he established a trust to go to his wife until her death if he died first, Ellie, as the wife\u2019s only child is MORALLY entitled to that money. Your late father was an asshole nor providing for her. Now you, knowing this and being rich, with all the inheritance and estate, refuse to even give her a painting that was sentimental to her mother. Why? Because she was going to sell it? So what? You conveniently shuffled past the value of the painting in your original post to gain sympathy and muddy the waters.  \u20ac100,000 is a life changing amount of money for almost everyone. And yet you would deny this to your neglected step-sister why? Maybe there is a reason she lied. You sound like a selfish, gate-keeping pedantic asshole. My condolences for your loss.",

Because her mum died first, she\u2019s gotten nothing. \n\nNow of course she\u2019s not legally entitled to any money, although for a decade her mum supported your dad enabling him to grow his wealth, so I *could* make a moral argument she\u2019s entitled to half of what ever your father earned in that decade.\n\nI guess generally I\u2019ve noticed that wealthy people are very good at hanging on to their wealth and finding legal/apparently moral justifications for doing so, when the kind thing to do would be to share some. \n\nOf course it\u2019s your choice.

Idk exactly, it doesn't seem as if your dad considered her part of your family. More an unavoidable bolt-on for being with her mum.\n\nI don't know if her mother was good to you your father, or how she was in those years, or if she deserves any sympathy, but I could see how that situation would be hard on her. \n\nThis isn't me saying give her the painting, it's yours to do with what you want and her method was underhanded but... Unless she had been awful growing up, in your situation I probably would give it to her regardless.  The painting and the money it's worth mean little,  when kindness is cheap, why not be kind?",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy (26F) dad passed away a few months ago. He and my mother were divorced, and his second wife passed away a couple of years ago, so I was the sole beneficiary of his will. Among his possessions was a painting which was chosen by his late wife to decorate their marital home, it was something of a wedding celebration present. His wife didn't work, my father bought the painting, the paperwork was all in his name etc. so it was included as part of his estate.   \nHis late wife had a daughter, \"Ellie\" (27F). Ellie contacted me some time ago asking if there was any way I would consider letting her have the painting since her mother loved it so much and it had sentimental value to her. I was a little suspicious of this because if this was the case, surely she could have asked my father for it after her mother's passing, but nevertheless I considered it. The piece is worth - by most standards - a lot of money and it's beautiful, so I wasn't pleased to part with it but since I never planned to sell it and it was not a piece that held any special significance to me amongst my father's collection, I decided I would gift it to her. I let her know I would make the arrangements to have it shipped, and straighten out all the paperwork.  \nAbout a week ago, I got a call from a friend of mine, who works at the gallery where my father purchased a lot of his art (she was his dealer, that is how we became friends). She let me know that Ellie had contacted her, looking for a valuation and information on selling the artwork that I was going to give her. My friend called me because she didn't know who Ellie was, but she knew the piece belonged to my father and it is one of a kind, so she was concerned about someone trying to fence it. This made me feel like a complete idiot, because I thought I was gifting Ellie what she considered a piece of her mother, to essentially gifting her a large sum of money got by subterfuge. I called Ellie to ask her what was going on and she reluctantly confirmed that she was planning to sell it. I said I wouldn't feel good about giving her one of my father's possessions just so she can sell it (especially after being lied to) and she said that was none of my business, and I should give it to her anyway since that money would mean more to her than the painting ever had to me.  \nEveryone I've asked for advice on what to do has some skin in the game, so to speak, so I just want an outside opinion. AITA for not giving her the painting?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s pretty clear from your comments that despite having an amicable relationship with your father, she got less than dirt from him.  And her mother wasn\u2019t in a position where she could have provided much when she passed.  It\u2019s also clear that you would have never considered helping her financially, despite being well off enough to own multiple properties and an extensive painting collection.  \u20ac100,000 is life-changing money.  She probably felt she had no choice but to try and pursue it.  Not to mention, she does have a claim on the painting if indeed the painting was a gift from your father to her mother.  You\u2019ve tried to argue against that in the comments, but it\u2019s pretty clear that was the spirit of the purchase, even if it isn\u2019t that way legally on paper.",

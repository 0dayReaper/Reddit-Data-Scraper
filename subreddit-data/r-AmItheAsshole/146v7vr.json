    "postText": "My (16F) sister (18F) just graduated high school. Her friend group wants to take a 2 week road trip to celebrate their graduation next month. In total there's 8 of them. My family has a van that can hold them all with room for their stuff. My sister wants to take it for their trip so they all can go in one car. The van is typically my mom's primary car and my dad has his car. We have a sedan that my sister and I share. My mom would take the sedan as her car for the two weeks, leaving me without a car for that time. \n\nI'm working 5 days a week this summer. My shift is typically M-F, 2-10pm. My parents gave me a couple of options to cope without a car. \n\nOne was walking the 30-45 minutes to and from work each day but I don't want to walk home for 45 minutes at 10pm. My parents are sleep by then so I can't get a ride home from them. (Also walking for that long in the summer afternoon would make me drenched in sweat by the start of my shift).\n\nAnother was seeing if my shift could get adjusted to earlier in the day. I talked to my boss and she doesn't think it's possible to set my schedule as that unless she knows someone else called in. \n\nAnother option was seeing if a coworker could give me a ride to and from work. There's 1 coworker I know of that works the same shift as me, but as soon as I said I could ask HIM about it, she said nevermind. \n\nThen the last one was to just not work those 2 weeks.   My mom had me call my boss on speakerphone to ask if I'd be able to do that. My boss said she can make it work but was disappointed that I didn't give her more notice. \n\nI don't want to take 2 weeks off of work. I'd be missing out on about $1000 (pre tax) of income. I'm trying to save up as much as possible for college. I also will have nothing to do for those 2 weeks. I'm the only one in my friend group that has access to a car and walking anywhere will take me forever and get me all sweaty. I also just don't like lounging around all day. \n\nI tried talking to my sister about it. I said if 2 of her friends drove their cars instead of our van, it'd probably be even better. Since our van is a gas guzzler, they'd probably get better mileage with even 2 cars. With 2 cars they also have more flexibility if something goes wrong or if people want to do other things. She told me to suck it up and I'm not gonna ruin this for her. \n\nI want my sister to have this trip. I don't think it's fair for me to be so impacted by it since her and her friends have options. Most of them have their own cars that they don't share. I want to be able to work and see my friends for those 2 weeks.",

I feel insane that no one is commenting that.\n\nOP is NTA for asking. Ok she\u2019s been told no, not much you do about it but the fact that the parents are being completely unsupportive in a) not offering a ride to OP and going to bed a bit later, b) not allowing OP to hitch a ride with a friend, and c) telling OP to call her boss and ask for 2 weeks off and lose out on $1k. That\u2019s ridiculous and really shitty imo.",

Her friend group wants to take a 2 week road trip to celebrate their graduation next month. In total there's 8 of them. My family has a van that can hold them all with room for their stuff. My sister wants to take it for their trip so they all can go in one car. The van is typically my mom's primary car and my dad has his car. We have a sedan that my sister and I share. My mom would take the sedan as her car for the two weeks, leaving me without a car for that time. \n\nI'm working 5 days a week this summer. My shift is typically M-F, 2-10pm. My parents gave me a couple of options to cope without a car. \n\nOne was walking the 30-45 minutes to and from work each day but I don't want to walk home for 45 minutes at 10pm. My parents are sleep by then so I can't get a ride home from them. (Also walking for that long in the summer afternoon would make me drenched in sweat by the start of my shift).\n\nAnother was seeing if my shift could get adjusted to earlier in the day. I talked to my boss and she doesn't think it's possible to set my schedule as that unless she knows someone else called in. \n\nAnother option was seeing if a coworker could give me a ride to and from work. There's 1 coworker I know of that works the same shift as me, but as soon as I said I could ask HIM about it, she said nevermind. \n\nThen the last one was to just not work those 2 weeks.   My mom had me call my boss on speakerphone to ask if I'd be able to do that. My boss said she can make it work but was disappointed that I didn't give her more notice. \n\nI don't want to take 2 weeks off of work. I'd be missing out on about $1000 (pre tax) of income. I'm trying to save up as much as possible for college. I also will have nothing to do for those 2 weeks. I'm the only one in my friend group that has access to a car and walking anywhere will take me forever and get me all sweaty. I also just don't like lounging around all day. \n\nI tried talking to my sister about it. I said if 2 of her friends drove their cars instead of our van, it'd probably be even better. Since our van is a gas guzzler, they'd probably get better mileage with even 2 cars. With 2 cars they also have more flexibility if something goes wrong or if people want to do other things. She told me to suck it up and I'm not gonna ruin this for her. \n\nI want my sister to have this trip. I don't think it's fair for me to be so impacted by it since her and her friends have options. Most of them have their own cars that they don't share. I want to be able to work and see my friends for those 2 weeks.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "comment": "I\u2019d have to say NAH. I get your sister\u2019s point of view because she just graduated high school and there\u2019s a chance that she won\u2019t see her friends either as frequently as before or not at all if they\u2019re all going to different colleges or moving away for whatever reason. This could be one of the last chances she has to do something like this. It\u2019s really difficult once you\u2019re in college and working to coordinate for all 8 of you to have the same days off to hang out and it\u2019s much more difficult to plan a 2 week vacation!\n\nI understand your point of view too though because you want to work and your only mode of transportation is being taken away. I don\u2019t think that you have much of a say in the matter though. Also, I doubt that any of your sister\u2019s friends would lend you their car for two weeks. I don\u2019t understand how some people even think that\u2019s an option because, like you said, it\u2019s probably under their parents\u2019 names and they don\u2019t really know you\u2026I mean, I was hesitant to even lend my car to my BIL for a few days because he crashed three cars in two weeks.\n\nAnyways, I think you\u2019re going to have to try to figure something out. If your boss, albeit begrudgingly or disappointedly, said that you could be off for two weeks if you had to, then why would she hesitate to change your schedule so that your parents could pick you up or so that you don\u2019t have to walk home at 10pm? Also, are your parents not home by 10pm so they can\u2019t pick you up? They could always put an alarm to wake up and drive you home from work if they go to sleep before 10pm. They\u2019re the ones who gave your sister permission to use the van, so it\u2019s only fair for them to help you out. And I really don\u2019t think that it\u2019s fair to expect you to walk home that late by yourself, so they can stay up late for two weeks to ensure your safety.",

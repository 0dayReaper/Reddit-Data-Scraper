Because I think a lot of people who live in cities are commenting on this. The nearest airport to me is 200 miles away. With gas prices the way they are you're looking at almost $300 to just get TO the airport. Plus 15 dollars a day to park your car because you can't Uber 200 miles so since you said you'd go for like 10 days (since no one takes a 20+ hour flight for a 3 day trip), that's another $180 dollars. $500 dollars right there.\n\n(Also Uber doesn't actually exist where I live. We don't HAVE public transport here, or taxis.)\n\nYou mentioned pets so I'm going to assume dog. Where I live has one dog kennel. They charge $50 a night for one dog, $75 for two dogs, $100 for three. So that's $600 to $1200 dollars.\n\nThat's like $2000 bucks in costs before even buying plane tickets. \n\nIf you need a car rental, what is that, like $30-50 a day? So another $300 to $500 because again not everywhere has public transport and also you're kind of an idiot if you think you'll take a bus to a wedding in a city you don't live in.\n\nThat's like $2500 of possible costs! It's almost like travelling is expensive or something.",

Skipping the wedding may be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. Especially if the cost of the trip is something that you could save for with minor budgeting adjustments.",

It sounds like OP and their partner are never going \"home\" again taking all this to it's logical conclusion.  A child is going to eat up resources for about 25 years from pre-natal care to them getting their first full-time job after trade school/higher ed/the military.  That's if they only have one. Then they're going to have to start ramping up putting money into a retirement fund.  There's always going to be something.  Partner's parents and Sis are going to have to get the money themselves if they ever want to see them again, whether that's paying for them to come or going to them.\n\nThey can shrug and say if they never see them again it's too bad but just the way it is, but Partner's parents are going to be devastated if that is where this is heading.  I think they're allowed to have a little room to feel that.",

I mean, if they add $1000 to savings per month, $10K is a significant amount of money to spend on a trip. But it is very much still doable, with some sacrifice. Going to one family event *for the entire rest of their lives* is something worth sacrificing for.\n\nOn the hand, maybe OP and her fianc\u00e9 are from the same country, and they are doing a 3 year rotation with a non-profit that doesn\u2019t pay a lot. If that\u2019s the case, then sure, send your regrets that you can\u2019t afford.",

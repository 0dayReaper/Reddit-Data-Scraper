    "postText": "I\u2019ve enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and I feel like I\u2019ve noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.\n\nGiven that, I think it\u2019s important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.\n\nSo just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you\u2019re an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.\n\nThey\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t try to be involved in your child\u2019s life, no matter how much support you pay. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you can\u2019t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you\u2019re childfree. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you can\u2019t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.\n\nThe internet has its own values, and that\u2019s fine. But in the real world, people who can\u2019t just go along to get along most of the time? People who don\u2019t want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don\u2019t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.\n\nSo yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people\u2019s opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub\u2019s judgement of who\u2019s the asshole in a given situation. I don\u2019t know if the disparity is just because of reddit\u2019s demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don\u2019t want to get down voted to oblivion.\n\nSo even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you\u2019re totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you\u2019re an asshole, well\u2026 there\u2019s probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they\u2019re being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don\u2019t technically \u201cowe\u201d anyone anything.\n\nOr maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That's a discussion worth having too.\n\nEdit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019ve never seen this movie, but it\u2019s come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent TL,DR: \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong Walter, you\u2019re just an asshole\u201d",

Upvote the judgements you agree with but skip the ones you don't. We want all opinions to be heard and discussed even if you disagree with them. We're not here to circlejerk, we're here to judge whether or not people are assholes.\n\nAlso please remember to upvote posts where you think OP is the asshole. I know it feels like you're rewarding them for bad behavior, but we want assholes to make it to our front page too.\n\n---\n\n**Edit:** I'm sorry everyone, we cannot turn off downvotes. The admins have not given us that option. There's a CSS trick to hide the button, but too many people use apps for that to effectively work.\n\nAlso, here's a [link to our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) and [rulebook](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/index). We have many questions answered there already!",

I sometimes dive in and try to correct stuff but there's so much misinformation in these threads that it's kind of scary. I really pity anyone who is foolish enough to take legal advice from this sub because it's almost certainly wrong, or even if it's correct in some jurisdictions, a lot of people confidently make blanket statements like they apply everywhere when they really don't, so there's still a really good chance that the person reading it is in a jurisdiction where it would be bad advice.",

But the absolute vitriol aimed at humans simply for being children, in this sub, is bananas.\n\nChild-free isn't an excuse to be a sociopath towards kids. Yeah, they are stupid and smaller (than the people who apparently think they are a plague) , but being shitty about them existing just highlights how immature people can be.\n\nIf you need to talk shit and feel superior to literal children, who don't chose their parents or how they are raised, then you are just as immature as they are. You're just a bigger, more independent child, and a bully. There's nothing to be proud of, because most of those kids will grow up and never call other people crotch spawn.\n\nI mean, it kinda just reeks of projection and envy, but in the least healthy way.",

He can't really grasp the ins-and-outs of programming and OOP. Does that make him stupid?\n\nIt makes us uneducated in the other's areas of (relative) expertise. People don't start off knowing everything about every topic. It doesn't make them stupid. It just means they need to learn.\n\nI might be splitting hairs here, but I get grumpy when people insinuate children are stupid. They're not stupid. They just have a lot to learn.\n\nWe all do.",

Even if the way the OP had been going about trying to get her husband to rehome the dog was not great (probably because of severe trauma), people were twisting themselves in knots and desperately googling articles to say the doctor HAD TO BE WRONG to justify why she was the only terrible person and not her husband who didn't seem to want to do anything to help his wife who lost six potential children growing inside of her. I felt like I was taking crazy pills reading that thread. Last I checked verdict was that she was the asshole, not even ESH and I saw so many people calling her abusive. It was wild. It felt like a creative writing experiment in seeing how shitty of a situation could be presented where reddit would still pick dogs over humans. I love animals too, but that shit was wild.",

The friend said no and refused to explain why. Then the guy found out that the friend had suddenly agreed to give a ride to a girl he hardly knew. The guy's dilemma was \"AITA for being angry with my friend?\". Everybody declared OP a huge, gaping asshole because the friend \"didn't owe him anything\".\n\nIf friendships in real life actually were based on what you \"owed\" your friend and vice versa, they wouldn't last more than a week. There is indeed a such thing as common courtesy that goes way beyond what you \"owe\" people, and that courtesy could be telling your good friend why you can't give him a ride.",

People were mostly saying that it doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s the better dog owner or the dog\u2019s primary caregiver, he deserves the dog because she cheated and you can\u2019t let a cheater win.",

One that REALLY bothered me was when a woman was going to drop off her toddler at her mom\u2019s house and would\u2019ve been late for the doctor because her mom wasn\u2019t home yet, and asked her childfree sister (who said in her own words that she \u201chates kids\u201d) to watch the kid. The sister initially refused, then agreed since it was five minutes. The kid hit his head because the sister left him alone and the woman was mad. \nI would\u2019ve seen this as maybe an ESH, or an NTA...but the overwhelming consensus was YTA, because she should have realized her sister couldn\u2019t handle basic responsibility for five minutes. In the real world, people aren\u2019t necessarily thought of as AHs for not wanting kids, but the type who loudly proclaim that they hate kids absolutely are...and if you\u2019re a grown adult who can\u2019t do someone a favor, you also suck.",

But it's true that the more rational, well-thought, and nuanced comments often get downvoted to oblivion because they aren't the knee-jerk, sexy, confrontational responses that people enjoy.  It's easy to offer judgement in one way from behind the safe anonymity of a keyboard and computer screen that you would never say to a friend of loved one to their face if they were in the same situation.  The world is very rarely painted in black and white, there's a shitload of grey out there, and all too often this sub finds itself with only two colors on their pallet.",

            "comment": "This is a really important point, and I'm glad someone's making it. A good example from the last 24 hours would be [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d6w9vq/wibta_if_i_told_my_inlaws_to_plan_and_pay_for_my/), where OP and his fiancee don't want a wedding reception, but his in-laws do, so he's wondering if he'd be TA if he \"told them that if they wanted the wedding reception so badly they should just plan and pay for it themselves.\"\n\nThere's no disputing the fact that they don't have to have a reception if they don't want one, and OP's in-laws should stop pressuring them, which is what the vast majority of commenters are saying. But handling the situation the way OP proposes would, in the real world, result in unnecessary pain and anguish for two people OP should be forging an amicable bond with. He'd absolutely be sabotaging the future happiness of all concerned, including himself, if he spoke to his future in-laws this way before he's even married their daughter.\n\nI'm not having a go at OP - he [responded to my suggestion in a really mature way.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d6w9vq/wibta_if_i_told_my_inlaws_to_plan_and_pay_for_my/f0vykz3/) But I wish commenters would think things through before advising people to dump their spouses or cut off their parents. Just because you technically have a *right* to do something doesn't mean it's a *good* thing to do. And in the real world - in relationships with family, friends, significant others, or the community at large - we do have to make decisions that preserve and build positive relationships, rather than getting what we think we deserve and leaving those relationships in ruins.\n\nEdit: Adding that while I never change a judgment based on general consensus, I do sometimes delete them, because waking up to 50 vitriolic messages disputing my judgment and calling me unspeakable names is sometimes not worth the trouble.",

Spurred on by the Internet, a lot of people previously silenced are finding their voices and finding that other people are like them, have the same experiences, and can talk to them. Women who submitted to abusive men can now read about signs of abuse and can find resources more easily than ever before. They may never have even heard that it's OK to leave, or know how to do it. Certainly nothing their extended family said--they told her \"just be a good wife,\" or \"God made the man the head of the household,\" or \"well, what did you do to make him mad?\" Sadly, abusers have a lot of willing enablers in many families, \"for the sake of family peace.\"\n\nTransgender issues are now being openly discussed. When I was a teen in the 1980s, NO ONE even talked about being GAY, much less trans. One of my high school friends has come out as gay DECADES after that time--it's nothing she could have said at the time. This kind of thing is true for \\*many\\* older Gen-Xers, much less Boomers. Think about the rigid gender roles of the 1950s. Many older people you know had to deal with that. Women couldn't even get checking accounts until the 1970s!  \n\nSo to sum up, sometimes the individualistic replies you see here represent people previously silenced who can now say something. Like the childfree unenthusiastic about babysitting. Reasonable people can disagree about whether they should be thought of as assholes or not to spend time taking care of other people's children, but it was a given that they would cheerfully do so in days gone by. Not any more--\"childfree\" is a lexicalized status now, even, in contrast to the \"barren\" or \"unhappy bachelor\" of years gone by. New concept, new voices.\n\nOr \"it's her body\" replies that seem to simplify an issue. There's so much baggage behind this one, and so much pain, that I can forgive someone reflexively defaulting to \"it's her body\" when it's a tattoo someone's partner dislikes. Assholish? Debatable--the point is that she didn't even have choices about her own body for much of American history. If the response is a little strident this time, it's understandable, to me at least.\n\nSo just because someone bucks what seems like \"polite behavior\" or \"going along to get along,\" it's worth remembering that perhaps there's a backstory here and a history of denied options that this person is now exercising.",

I got over 200 downvotes for saying \u201cto be fair, bus drivers have a lot to pay attention to and sometimes mistakes happen. But you should still report it.\u201d I was AGREEING that they should report it but I still got downvoted to hell for defending the bus driver",

All of the well thought out ESH posts get downvoted to oblivion. Mean while the most circle-jerky response, \"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes\" always get the most upvotes. People forget that there are much more ways to maturely handle these situations.",

OP said he had no reason to refuse except that he just liked having Wednesday's off instead of Tuesdays. You can find it in my comment history. This subreddit seems to think \"wrong\" is ONLY obligations. I pointed out that if at absolutely no cost to you at all you are unwilling to help someone, you are kind of an asshole (which is how it would be seen in the real world) and got downvoted heavily.",

    "postText": "so two years ago my parents got a divorce so it was just me and my mom in our house. i can\u2019t remember if it was before or after the divorce but i suddenly started becoming overheated so easily. i couldn\u2019t even wear a tank top to bed without waking up covered in sweat, it\u2019s really uncomfortable. maybe it was a placebo that just snowballed but i can wear clothes out in pubic, including sweaters in the winter and stuff like that. or maybe i just notice it more when i\u2019m home, idk\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nBut anyway, after my dad left i started wearing only underwear and a bra just so i didn\u2019t suddenly step into the living room, tits out. my mom saw me and she was disgusted, she asked me why i wasn\u2019t wearing clothes and i told her my problem but she still insisted that i put something on. but i kept doing it after that because i was still always too hot. so every time my mom see\u2019s me only wearing underwear she gets angry and tells me to put clothes like i just ate a cockroach or something. it doesn\u2019t matter how many times that i try to explain to her that it\u2019s very uncomfortable for me. so i started only wearing just underwear in my own room where i surely thought she didn\u2019t have a problem with that. but she did! i can\u2019t even do it in the comfort of my own room!! \n\nBut i do feel bad because i can sorta get behind why it\u2019s not something you\u2019d wanna see. what would you say?",

    "postText": "My friend (m33) and I (m26) run a pretty popular podcast. We talk about a very big, annual music competition that has a huge cultural relevance in our country. We usually talk about the artists, their music and sometimes have them over as guests too.\n\n\r  \nRecently, it happened more and more often that my friend would say offensive things about artists (not when they\u2019re with us but when we did reviews). He didn\u2019t give his opinion in an objective way but made mean comments about their physical appearances and even made vomiting noises at some of their performances. \n\nWhen I told him to be less harsh, he told me that he was just speaking his mind.\r  \nI\u2019m in charge of editing our audio before it goes online and lately I\u2019ve cut out a lot of the things he said, when I felt like they were too offensive. He doesn\u2019t like hearing his own voice so he doesn\u2019t listen to the final product and trusts me with the edit. \n\n\r  \nPart of me feels bad for editing out his opinion. We have freedom of speech but I feel like he\u2019s getting out of control and that these rude comments might prevent us from getting more guests in the future. \n\nAlso, I would like to add that we are a well known podcast inside that fandom and this could risk us getting a lot of unnecessary hate, that I\u2019d like to avoid.\n\n\r  \nAITA for censoring the things he said?",

Secretly editing out his offensive opinions and then him not knowing about it is only going to end in disaster. He will find out and explode. He will say something offensive publicly at an event and your podcast will get cancelled because he thinks these offensive things have been acceptable until now.

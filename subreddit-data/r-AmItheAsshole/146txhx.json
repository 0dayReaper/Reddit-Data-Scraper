She is usually sitting on the coach watching TV and does nothing else all day. And when she demands me to get her the candy/sweets I will be punished if I don't give her any (not physically, I guess I just wont be able to go on my computer?)\n\nEarlier when she called my name to come down and pass her a whole box of chocolate, while passing her the chocolate I said \"You're fat - you know that right? You should lose some weight\" and as she snatches the chocolate out my hand, she gives me a stare and then calls me an asshole and to \"fuck off upstairs\". \n\nReddit - Am I the asshole for telling my mother that she is simply just fat and to lose weight?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You may want to drop a hint during the day, not when you are aggravated with her right then.\n\nI have heard other parents talk like this to their kids and for the life of me, I dont understand.  I can think of NO reason I would tell my 15 year old that.  For the record I have twin (26f), (24m) and (9m), had plenty of falling outs as they grew up, even had them speak less than respectful to me but I have never said anything like that to any of my children.",

When they see our neighbors in their yard, they\u2019ll run to the fence and bark. When I hear this, I immediately go outside and corral them into the house. So they will bark for maybe 10 to 15 seconds max before going inside. Sometimes they stop after 1 bark. The neighbor screamed at me yesterday and threatened to call the cops as I grabbed both dogs and was walking them in the house.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

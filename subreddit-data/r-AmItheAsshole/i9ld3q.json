Hopefully OP\u2019s update will inspire them to get out there and get the help they need.\n\nFWIW I am so much happier and feel like I am able to be myself now. My OCD is under much better control, and I\u2019m able to enjoy spending time with my kids.  I hope OP and others will be able to do the same.\n\nEdit: spelling, punctuation",

Hopefully things will become much happier and healthier for you all \ud83d\udc96",

My rule of thumb for teasing out \u201csome OCD tendencies but not full blown OCD\u201d from true OCD is, do you do weird shit? Do you have odd beliefs? Does this cause you problems? Do you waste a lot of time on it?\n\nPeople with OCD often have a weird form of reasoning I\u2019ve found. We get stuck on tiny things. Fears tend to have a really irrational component. Imo this is pretty blatant on r/OCD\n\nI used to not believe my OCD was really causing me problems but that honestly wasn\u2019t true at all. For one thing, I wasted a LOT of time on it. It affected my relationships. I had a lot of odd fears and I would avoid tons of things.\n\nI can try to answer questions if you have any, just keep in mind I\u2019m not a professional\n\nAlso, people sometimes confuse OCPD with OCD. I thought I had OCPD but it turned out to be OCD. Some people also have more of a general anxiety problem with slight OCD tendencies.\n\nETA: this is the type of stuff I mean on r/OCD:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/i9fnre/tw_pocd_the_most_fucked_up_thing_just_happened/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nIf that\u2019s relatable to you in any way, imo high chance you have OCD. Even if it\u2019s in a completely different context, the pattern of minor thing happens -&gt; irrational fear triggered -&gt; get scared and freak out is kind of how it goes. Since OCD presents different in different people if you don\u2019t relate to this it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have OCD though.\n\nAlso, one key difference between being perfectionistic vs true OCD is that perfectionism doesn\u2019t necessarily have the degree of *fear* that OCD has. Perfectionist compulsions typically involve excessive fear and/or clearly excessive/odd rituals (like rewriting words over and over, preventing you from completing things)",

No. But that does not mean that your current level of OCD will be what you\u2019re destined to have for the rest of your life. People sometimes get worse after diagnosis because they think \u201cfuck, okay, this makes sense, guess this is just what I\u2019m like\u201d. But that\u2019s not true. Anyone who has been diagnosed for a longer period of time will tell you that obsessions come and go in intensity, topic, and manifestation. It\u2019s not like diabetes or HIV where bam, now you have it, sorry, try to manage it. It is a *manifestation* of anxiety you are already going through. It will change. It can and will get better.\n\n**We are currently going through a very triggering time. It is understandable to be at an all time low. This does not mean you will struggle like this forever.** CBT, or even just CBT-style thinking without the help of professionals, is very valuable and can make a big difference. And remember: you can not control the obsessions, but you CAN control the compulsions. Anyone who wants to talk with a seasoned veteran, DM me &lt;3",

Sure, there\u2019s a line between OCD and people who like having a routine, but there\u2019s no divide between what is and isn\u2019t a compulsion. /r/OCD can tell you that some are pretty fucking weird lol. \n\nRemember \u2014 we do compulsions in _response_ to the obsessions. They are not obsessions **and** compulsions. They are compulsions born out of obsessions (even if we do not always realise it). A normal amount of self-awareness is also a diagnostic criteria for OCD. For example, think about the difference between saying:\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s dumb but I always have to put my finger in the keyhole after I lock it because otherwise I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s really locked, idk I guess I\u2019m scared of being burgled?\u201d \n\nVersus\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get it. I HAVE to put my finger in the lock after I lock it. If I don\u2019t, burglars will get it. Trust me.\u201d\n\nOne is OCD. One is manic/delusional.\n\nSo I cannot tell you if your behaviour is normal or not based on what the compulsion or obsession is, but I can encourage you to reflect on:\n\n(1) Why do you do the compulsion? Can you deduce the root obsessive thought?\n\n(2) What is the origin of the thought? Usually it\u2019s fear of death, fear of social embarrassment, or fear of physical harm (including disease/contamination). Actually, I\u2019ll go out on a limb and say it\u2019s nearly always one of those (if you deduce it far enough)\n\n(3) what happens when you don\u2019t do it? How does the rest of your day go?\n\nI can\u2019t give you points out of 10 for each and tell you if you hit a certain number, you have The Disorder\u2122. That is what psychiatrists do. But if it is causing you regular mental unrest, you have a problem \u2014 it doesn\u2019t really matter if that\u2019s full blown OCD or just a spell of anxiety, and either way, the treatment is the same: self reflect, learn about it, partake in CBT practices which basically boils down to \u201cbegin to face your fears at a reasonable rate\u201d.

It doesn't matter HOW much you \"say\" you love someone, if you still treat them like shit. You either teach your kids you don't actually love them, or teach them that abuse=love. \n\nGood on OP for taking the next steps.

If anything, the strength of his feelings for me made it worse, because so many of his abusive behaviours were rooted in fear or anxiety regarding wanting me to be his and worrying he'd lose me.\n\nSame with my mother.  I know she loves me.  Hell, she legit refers sometimes to her \"womb aching\" when she describes missing me, and I'm 36.  And again, the strength of her feelings likely contributes heavily to the toxic behaviour I was subjected to for so long.\n\nI'm really glad OP had the wake up call they needed and that they're getting help.  Hopefully one of the things they'll learn is that the motivation behind your actions and your underlying feelings can explain your behaviour, but don't justify it.  And love is, ultimately, a verb.

And I get that we\u2019re all just hugboxing in this thread because of that. But her oldest kids are 13 and 16, which means they\u2019ve been living this way for 13 and 16 years respectively. Her behavior was enough for the 16 year old to leave the house and the rest of her family to support that. That is a huge development likely predicated by a whole lot of bullshit, and all of the damage that was done for the majority of the kids\u2019 lives isn\u2019t suddenly undone because OP sees the light now. It\u2019s been 56 days since the OP. A lot of people say they will change when they are confronted with the possibility of losing their children, and I hope OP actually does. But the fact is 56 days ago and likely for their entire lives before that, OP was treating her children this way. Looking at those YTA comments through the \u201cwholesome update/Reddit Success Story\u201d lens might make them seem harsh. But I don\u2019t think those replies were over the top, perhaps some downvoted or deleted ones were but all the \u201cmean\u201d top comments were 100% deserved.\n\nEdit: number of days was slightly off",

Unfortunately it took a very serious health scare on my sister\u2019s end for her to wake up.

            "comment": "My mother growing up had severe OCD and was incredibly controlling, and was super religious to boot. She didn't get help until I was a senior in high school. But that was too late for us, at 18, just like all my older siblings, I left home. I also went ultra low contact with her for five years. I was so bitter about my childhood. I saw a therapist and got help. I let it go. One holiday when we were talking, she asked me for advice on a workplace conflict. I realized how different therapy had made her. We started talking again. Mainly she always asked me for advice, and admitted often how it was sound advice, but she was too stubborn/petty/controlling to be able to do that easily. But she tried, and she shared her stories of trying.\n\nThat was over a decade ago. These days, my mom and I have a really good relationship. She's since apologized for how controlling she was when I was a kid, which I never realized was an apology I needed to hear. I thought I was over it. She's really good about respecting my opinions and boundaries as an adult. I never in my youth thought that I would have a good relationship with my mom. It took years for us to both feel better, but neither of us would be so happy with our relationship without a therapist's help. \n\nI'm so so happy for you. Good job.",

Don't be surprised though if your kids don't trust this new version of you. You have spent there whole lives building this toxicity in their lives and you cannot change it overnight. It could still be permanent damages to yalls relationship and you need to accept that and any boundaries they put on you as they get older.",

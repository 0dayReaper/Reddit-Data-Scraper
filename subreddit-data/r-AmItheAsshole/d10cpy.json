    "postText": "New to reddit, please bare with. \n\nSo I (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. Up until last week, things were perfect between us. \n\nHowever, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. She and I have quite a lot in common, and I actually like spending time with her. However it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. Now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; I'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. However, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if I want coffee. I sleep naked. Every time prior to the last one, I've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. I always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says \"but I didn't\". \n\nWhen she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what. She immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My mate later pulled me aside and said I was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that I'd \"threatened\" to do it before (I literally just said \"okay but what if I had no covers and you saw everything\" before). They're now framing this to others that I'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how I get my rocks off, and I'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. AITA for doing this?",

She needs to respect privacy but yeah, you knew full well what she would do and, rather than talk to your friend like an adult about how uncomfortable it makes you, you knowingly and deliberately exposed yourself to her.\n\nEdit: A lot of people have replied asking how it's deliberate. I've said it a few times, but he knew she'd see him naked. He was exposed where he had previously not been exposed. In knowing she entered his room without knocking, he knew she would see him naked.\n\nHis intent was that she see him naked.\n\nEdit 2: I think it may seem like I don't think she's as in the wrong, but I think she's more in the wrong, but why she sucks is obvious and requires little explanation. Spending more time explaining why I think he sucks too is necessary and may have given the false impression that I think he's more wrong. My apologies for not making that clearer in the first place.

There's no reason he shouldn't be naked in his own room, and therefore there's no reason he should feel guilty for being naked there. \n\nMaybe you'd argue that one reason he shouldn't be naked is because he knows there's a chance that the GF will barge in... but I'd say that's just a reason for the GF not to barge in in the first place, rather than a reason for OP not to be naked.\n\nBesides, OP *did* talk to the GF like an adult *multiple times* when he warned her that he could be naked. It's not clear whether he explicitly told her not to barge into the room without knocking, but \"I might've been naked!\" *heavily* implies that OP wasn't comfortable with it.\n\nI do think OP's intent was slightly assholish, because it's not that he really enjoyed being naked - he did it for the purpose of teaching the GF a lesson. However, I don't think OP was a *creep* for doing this - it was still 100% the GF's fault, even accounting for OP's intent. The GF exposed OP to herself, rather than OP exposing himself to the GF.",

I sleep naked, I would feel more comfortable if she knocked, and she ignored my wishes *and* disregarded my privacy. \n\nIt's not fair that I have to be clothed or covered in *my* private space because she doesn't respect it. I apologize for coming across as creepy, that was not my intention. I don't want her to see me naked, *that is the whole point of me asking her to knock*.\n\nI didn't want to start anything or cause issues between us, but I am fully expecting her to knock from now on, or we are going to have issues.",

    "postText": "Edit :Background story : \n\nFor the previous three years, I, a f, 32, was in a situation-ship with this man 35. Although he  an always expresses serious intent, I have always thought that he lacks maturity. Or I have stuff I need to improve on. I cut off communication with him in November of last year and resumed it earlier this year, then cut him off again after finding a female contact. He contacted me last month because he couldn't find anyone to drive him home from the hospital and needed a ride. \n\nAITA ,  because  I won't be there for him when he's at his lowest? He just underwent surgery and he is alone. However, the year my brother passed away was also the year he was readily amused by someone else. He claimed that it was merely a new friendship. I don't think it's true. He never even bothered to ask how I was doing. Yes, he was blocked, but not on social media; he is aware of my home address and email addresses. It's a lame justification, in my opinion. mostly because I had sent him flowers on the occasion of his mother's death!  When we weren't even speaking. He now refers to me as being toxic because all I said was, \"I feel bad for you.\" I cannot and will not be behind him. He needs to learn this lesson. Why in the world do I need to stand by him if he wasn't there for me when I lost my brother?",

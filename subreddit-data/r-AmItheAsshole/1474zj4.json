    "postText": "I live with my parents. My mom came back from Florida vacation earlier this year  with an absolutely *horrendous* seashell decoration for our house. The design is basically a bunch of seashells lined up in a spiral, and while others may not see an issue with it, I have trypophobia and the first time I saw it, it sent body wrenching shivers down my back.\n\nMy family has a lot of decoration that I dislike but I've never taken issue with them until this one. My mom wanted to put it in the dining room or living room where I could see it any time I leave my room. I told her I hated the decoration and that it was extremely ugly. Of course she disagreed. I tried explaining to her exactly why I hated it and my trypophobia but she wasn't really understanding.\n\nSo I ended up hiding the decoration in a drawer out of my sight, but a couple days later it was back. So I hid it again, rinse and repeat 3x over the next few months and my mom asked me why the hell I was trying to hide it. I told her again I really really hated looking at it. There's multiple weird (and mildly disturbing) things around my house but that is by far  the worst.\n\nEventually I just ended up throwing it away. When my mom asked me a few weeks later where the decoration was, I told her the truth and she started yelling at me. She said it cost her a lot of money. I felt bad and said we can go buy a new decoration together, just not as something as ugly as that one. But she didn't care and was still upset. AITA here?",

However you seem just as, if not more, concerned with your parents decor taste. This doesn't help your case at all. At the end of the day it's your parents house and they can decorate it how they please even if it is ugly. Instead of describing your method of making amends to your mom as, \"I offered to buy her a new one so long as it doesn't trigger my phobia,\" you said \"so long as it's not *ugly*\". If you'd been more mature about your approach you could have made a valid case for yourself but instead you focused on criticizing and belittling your mom's taste in decor. I hope you're able to learn how to communicate more effectively from this scenario and resolve conflicts more amicably.",

That's partially why  it was difficult to explain exactly why I hated it. I can explain the basic concept and everything but my mom only understands English up to a middle school level or so, and conversely I can only explain things up to a 6th grade level in our Native tongue, unfortunately telling her why that decoration rattled my soul in a negative way is difficult. \\[Not impossible just really difficult and a lot of times it's just annoying for both parties because we have to sit there for like 2 hours and try to decipher the other one's language\\]\n\nEdit; I don't even know what the word for phobia is in our language \ud83d\ude2d Her native culture barely believes in mental health &amp; even allergies tbh (it took me literally years to convince my mom that my banana allergy was real) trying to explain to her something like trypophobia would be an uphill battle",

                            "comment": "But you weren't explaining it to your mom in the post. You were explaining it to English speakers on Reddit and you still mostly focused on it being ugly. You're still not quite getting it because you chose to describe it to even strangers as primarily ugly as opposed to as scary and illness inducing(which again super valid). \n\nAlso I'm an immigrant, English is my second language, so I totally understand your point of view and your mom's really. Honestly I completely understand you thinking your mom wouldn't get it. Even if you were able to describe your phobia in your mom's native tongue she might have still been dismissive and for that I truly do feel for you. Immigrant parents aren't always the best at understanding matters relating to mental health.\n\n I still think you still went about it the wrong way unfortunately. Even a 6th grader knows how to describe when something makes them uncomfortable to the point of being sick. You could have googled trypophobia and found a site in her native tongue. My only point is that you didn't have to resort to belittling your mom's taste or hiding/ throwing away her objects because of the language barrier. Then she's definitely not going to listing to you! Like let's be real even on a good day immigrant parents don't want to listen us. \n\nThat being said, I will say in light of this, I can agree more with others that this is an ESH situation.",

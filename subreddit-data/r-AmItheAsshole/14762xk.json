I would never ask them to have their future lives revolve around a struggling sibling. It is one thing to ask you to stay in touch and be there when you can and another to become a caregiver/guardian. If do everything I could as a parent to keep them from being burdened by that. If I was in their shoes, I might choose to give most of the money in trust to that child for their future care, but that would be the extent likely of any impact.",

If you are in the USA, B is already in an adult family home and if your parents were to die would become a ward of the state, his guardianship does not just automatically pass to you because your parents want that. You would have to pursue legally becoming his guardian if you wanted such a thing. When your brother turned 18 your parents actually pursued staying as his legal guardian, instead of him becoming a ward of the state or having someone else agree to become the guardian.  It is no small feat to take over legal guardianship and you are not wrong to not want to do that. I would recommend having a serious convo with your parents about it and setting a firm boundary for them that you are not going to be doing that.  If they can not respect that then you would be in the right to consider limiting or cutting off contact with them.",

They've helped and continue to help your siblings so they should help you as well. Look at it that way. You deserve a life just as your siblings do. But their lives aren't predicated on you supporting them. You are only responsible for yourself. That's it. Lower your contact with your family. Say your studies are getting really intense and you need to focus on them more. Once you get your degree I'd go no contact with your parents for a while. As for having children, focus on your studies and then your career. You can always adopt. Or you may meet someone in the future with children that would satisfy your need to parent. But you have enough on your plate right now. Get through your schooling. Stand up to your parents regarding your siblings.  One thing at a time. You've got this.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nTo preface the story\u2026. I, 26F, have 3 brothers w/ Autism, 30(B), 22 (T1), 22 (T2). B lives in an apartment  community for adults w/ disabilities, does not drive, and works ~3 days a week at retail jobs. My parents currently have guardianship over B. T1 is a surgical instrument processing tech at a hospital, gay, antisocial, but has blossomed when they were introduced to a local pride community. T2 is an entry level electrician, social butterfly, undependable. T1&amp;2 live at home and drive. I am in the middle of my pharmD 12 hours away from home. I only get along with T2 and on occasion T1, I can not stand B. None of the brothers get along.\n\nI grew up being told not to have children because they would be disabled. My own anxiety, depression, and ADHD went untreated until early adulthood because my parents were focused of my brothers and I was \u201ccoping\u201d and signs present differently in girls so I was just labeled as defiant and attention seeking. I have had many partners leave me over my siblings. I ride the fence about wanting kids because I have been made to feel like \u201cdamaged goods\u201d. I was told to go get a degree that would be able to support me as well as my siblings. My mom will make comments about B living with me when they die and getting guardianship. Or how it\u2019s my responsibility to watch over them because it\u2019s family. \n\nI moved 12 hours away to break free and my mom guilts me with trying to convince me to move back because she can\u2019t move away because of the programs B is in. Every time I tell my mom that her and my dad better leave a good inheritance for them because it\u2019s not my responsibility, they\u2019re not my kids, write me out of the will, it hurts her and she gets mad at me.\n\nB will require me to drive them everywhere, is extremely inconsiderate and rude, is zero self reliant, and I can\u2019t even imagine the fight over me \u201ccontrolling\u201d him by having guardianship over him. I want zero to do with it, every time I look at him I feel resentful and that I didn\u2019t choose this life. Sometimes I think about just cutting everyone off to avoid the situation. \n\nAITA because I don\u2019t want to be a caregiver?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "postText": "So my (23F) twin sister J had been dating this guy back in highschool, let's call him L, who I initially didn't like very much (he was actually a really sweet kid in hindsight, we just didn't really mesh well at the time since we ran in very different crowds) who adored and doted on her. \n\nNow the main issue came to light when I found out that J had hooked up with my then gf's (now wife's) bestfriend M - who had also become a close friend of mine - behind L's back. And this wasn't the first time she cheated on him either, but had told me that she had come clean about the previous time with her ex and they moved on from it. Spoiler alert - she had not, and poor L was none the wiser. \n\nM also didn't have a clue about L, since we attended different schools (L, my sister &amp; I went to the local public school, while my gf &amp; M went to a nearby private school) and J nor L were very active on social media about their relationship. They were also more of casual hook-up thing than anything. \n\nFeeling bad for L who had done nothing wrong and also not wanting M to potentially get hurt either, I got into an argument with J and gave her an ultimatum - either she comes clean to the both of them or I will. \n\nOf course I ended up being the one who told them. L was crushed obviously and it effectively ended their relationship. M wasn't overly miffed about it but did feel bad for L and apologised to him personally for her part, to which he insisted it wasn't her fault. (The only brightside to this story was the fact that they become friends after).\n\nMy sister absolutely blew up at me for \"destroying\" her relationship, to which I responded to by comparing her to our narcissistic mother, who had practically done the exact same thing to the only decent bf she ever had only a few months prior, which also didn't end well for her either. \n\nI don't think J has ever forgiven me for the comment, our relationship only became strained from that point onwards, but over the years she has developed habits like our mother which have only stood to prove my statement true time and time again.\n\nJ recently brought up how much this comment affected her in an over the phone argument a few days ago, which was the inspiration behind this post. My wife insists that it is simply my sister acting like my mother again - rehashing old wounds to emotionally manipulate me, which was a favourite of my mother's (my wife grew up in a fairly healthy family environment and has a much better scope for this type of thing than me), however honestly I'm just not sure anymore. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

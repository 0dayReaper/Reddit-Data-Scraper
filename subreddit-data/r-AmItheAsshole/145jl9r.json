I don't know pricing for Apple products but I do know there are places to get reconditioned laptops. An $800 windows laptop is getting into low end gaming or video production work, much more than any 14 yr old should be taking to baseball practice (Note - I played baseball on serious amateur level into my 30's and never took any electronics to the field. ) \n\nSince your son did throw the ball I would consider offering $100 towards a reconditioned laptop, but nothing towards a new one. I strongly doubt the hard drive was damaged so all of the info can be transferred by any local computer repair shop, call around for pricing.",

However, the owner had a responsibility to keep that item safe. Leaving it on a baseball field probably negates your liability. However, even if you were found to be responsible for half, the amount would be based on the value of the laptop at that time, and not what it cost new. So how old was it? What was it worth as a used laptop? How did they come up with $800? You certainly aren't fully responsible and probably aren't responsible at all.\nEdit: NTA",

Presumably this was an after-school practice, so the other child would have his laptop or Chromebook with him. Yes, it could have been stored in an inner pocket, but even then there\u2019s no guarantee that it wouldn\u2019t have been damaged. \n\nIf the OP\u2019s son broke a car window, he would absolutely be liable and I\u2019m astonished that he\u2019d believe otherwise. \n\nThe appropriate thing to do would be to ask for the documentation of the laptop\u2019s non-repairable condition (which I doubt exists) and if the other parents are able to provide that, make them whole by offering to reimburse them for half the cost of a comparable refurbished laptop, the price of which would be agreed upon in advance. \n\nI think they\u2019re fishing for a new laptop when the damage probably amounts to a cracked screen, so if they are unable to provide proof that the laptop\u2019s totaled, I\u2019d offer to meet them at an independent repair shop - not a retail store - to get a quote and proceed with reimbursement or advance for the repair or replacement cost accordingly. \n\nLost in this discussion seems to be considerations of modeling personal responsibility and compromise, while also valuing their son\u2019s friendship with the other boy. It would be really unfortunate if both parents\u2019 inability to behave like reasonable adults spelled the end of their children\u2019s friendship.",

I don't think anybody could reasonably try to go find who was at bat and somehow blame them for an errant ball. \n\nIt's like getting hit in the face at the bleachers by a bad hit, nobody blames the hitter.  It's an accident.  Both the player and person in the bleachers assume reasonable risk by just being there.   \n\n\\- \n\nIf this was just kids playing at a corner lot in a neighborhood,  maybe I could see somebody owning up to hitting a car or hitting a bad with a laptop in it being something you take some responsibility for.

Although, your plan could apply a deductible that is equivalent to the cost of a laptop.\n\nDue to the laptop having been left on the ball field, I'd offer to pay only half.\n\nESH",

You can afford it (I\u2019m assuming you won\u2019t end up restricting necessary food, shelter or medical care) you replace it. If you cannot pay it all up front, have a discussion about paying off in instalments - especially if the other family can purchase the laptop up front. \n\nThis is also a good reminder to maybe change where things are stored during practice. A safety fence or storage bin would likely have been cheaper.",

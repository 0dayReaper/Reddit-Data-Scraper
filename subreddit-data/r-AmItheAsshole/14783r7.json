    "postText": "So my girlfriend just recently told me as I was working on making dinner with things we had around the house that a portion of the money she had for shopping had went towards a dance team fundraiser. Before I continue, I would like to mention that we are broke. Living in a rent house that I make just enough to pay for the rent and utilities with just barely enough to pay for food or groceries in general. My girlfriend is struggling to secure a job and therefore I am paying for everything solo. It's a struggle and I've had to swallow my own pride to ask friends or family for help with food. \n\n    So, as I mentioned prior. I had asked one of my friends for help with food, said friend (Who I will refer to as Jane for privacy) was more than happy to help but was only able to spare $20. Jane said that this could hopefully get us dinner for a few nights, saying she knew the struggle. I had work that day so I let my girlfriend take care of it since she is home at all times. This was a week ago, she decided to break it to me this afternoon while I'm debating with her about what I can work with to make food that she had given half of that $20 to a Dance Team Fundraiser since she used to be a part of one of those teams herself. I told her that that was a horrible idea since we needed the money to be able to afford things to make for dinner and we weren't in a position to be donating to fundraisers like that. \n\n     She was aggravated to say the least, that I was criticizing her for that decision. However, it's the truth, we needed that money to be able to eat more than once a day. Having to come home from a tough manual labor job starving is punishing enough, knowing both me and my girlfriend likely won't eat every night. Knowing that money that could've been used to ensure we were properly fed went to a nonessential team, not even a charity but an extracurricular group, just set me off. She's been acting like I'm somehow in the wrong for saying that was a bad decision, saying I'm being self-centered.",

If this was about change or something it would be a different story but $10 can easily turn into a few days worth of food, even now. \n\nThere's something to be said for people needing to donate to feel good about themselves. It makes you feel more human, lifts pressure for a second, makes you feel like you have agency... But not with gifted money and certainly not when you're not contributing at all financially.",

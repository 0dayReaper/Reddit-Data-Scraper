    "postText": "Fake names\n\nMy sister, Karla, (25f) lives with our parents. They have a dog, Ina, that we\u2019ve taken to the vet a number of times since February where they discovered she has IMHA (some kind of anemia in dogs). Most of the time I\u2019m driving my sister to their appointments because she doesn\u2019t drive, and my parents are at work. They love Ina, but have always said that if something happens to her to just let her go because they\u2019re not going to help pay for treatment. Karla has spent over 10k on treatments for Ina. Lately, my mom has been telling Karla to stop treating her so she could save her money, or put her down. Karla has obviously refused. \n\nThis brings us to this weekend. Karla left on Friday to an out of town trip for the weekend with her friends and will be returning later today. Friday night after she left, Ina started drinking lots of water and vomiting. I asked my parents to just keep an eye on her overnight. Saturday, she continued to vomit and wouldn\u2019t eat, wouldn\u2019t take any of her meds. My sister started to get worried because some of her meds shouldn\u2019t be missed. \n\nLast night, however, my sister called me asking to take Ina to emerge because Ina was vomiting excessively. I wasn\u2019t able to because I couldn\u2019t leave my newborn and did not have any milk prepared. My parents refused because they were tired and were coming home from cleaning at their part time job. So Karla called her best friend, Aliya, who happened to be close by anyways and was happy to take Ina. (Aliya is really close to the family, sleeps over and hangs out with them often). Karla called my grandma to open the door for Aliya, and my grandma called my mom shortly after to tell her Aliya was coming. Well my mom was pissed, and got upset with Karla asking \u201cwhy did you have to call Aliya\u201d and \u201cdid you think I can\u2019t do it?\u201d Aliya took Ina to the vet, and my mom ended up going with her as she didn\u2019t think it was right to let someone else take her dog to the vet for her. They left at 11pm and ended up coming home at 3am.\n\nHere\u2019s where I might be TA, Karla told me how mom berated her for calling Aliya and made her feel bad when she was just trying to get the care needed for Ina. I called my mom to ask how Ina was and then commented, \u201cI\u2019m surprised you went with Aliya\u201d. \nWhen she asked what I meant, I said, \u201cwell I know you wouldn\u2019t have taken her and you don\u2019t usually go out that late\u201d.\nShe said, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna let her go when it\u2019s not her dog, so I went with her\u201d. \nTo which I replied, \u201cbut if you were gonna go with her anyways, you could\u2019ve just taken Ina by yourself so she wouldn\u2019t have had to come with\u201d. \n\nI was then called an asshole, and was hung up on. So.. AITA?",

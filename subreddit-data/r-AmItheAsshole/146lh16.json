    "postText": "I (13F) am a competitive figure skater part of a larger team of coaches. I don\u2019t take from all of them, but I can\u2019t take from anyone out of the team.\n\nI have a coach who we can call x. He has been teaching me a jump I struggle with and I was in a lesson with him on this fateful day.\n\nNow we have coach y, who I\u2019ve never taken from in my life. \n\nIn case nobody knows, in a freestyle session, program takes priority, then students who are being coached, then people just skating.\n\nI was jumping with coach x, finally being able to focus on myself, when I accidentally cut a girl doing her program off. I tried to get out of her way when I saw her, but we both kinda did this weird \u201cgo around each other\u201d maneuver. no big deal, I continue jumping. Then, when I come back about 5 minutes later, coach y started screaming at me. I had no idea why, she was just going off on me. So I asked for clarification and she yells that she was recording her student when I cut her off. I muttered an embarrassed (and remorseful) apology. She walks off fuming.\n\nLater that day, I\u2019m told by my best friend that I cut off this girl twice (without realizing it or even knowing who y was referring to). I found out it was the girl I mentioned earlier. But I only remember accidentally cutting her off once and TRYING to get out of her way.\n\nEveryone I\u2019ve spoken to says it\u2019s her fault, not mine, for yelling at me. But this is starting to cause issues.\n\nAdditional details: the other day, a 7 year old girl cut me off while I was doing something dangerous, we both could have gotten very hurt had I not barely seen her during my program. She did not get in trouble.\n\nThis is also not the first time, I joined the team last year and this is now the second time she\u2019s yelled at me like that.\n\nBut AITA for blaming her when I did cut off her student?",

My only suggestion is to ask your coach who was working with you on jumps if you were in the wrong or there was a better way to handle it on the ice. It sounds like there are a lot of things going on at one time during that skate.",

The other coach may have yelled because she got nervous or was hoping to get the video quickly and it had to be redone. Maybe she is just a yeller.  I know it makes you feel guilty to be yelled at, but listen to your coach. They would not lie about something that could be dangerous to you (and the other skater) or could be easily corrected. Keep an eye on the other coach and observe her normal coaching style. She may just react that way to the smallest things or it may just be a bad day.",

From my brief time figure skating, this seems like an accident. If you intentionally went out there and cut her off or didn\u2019t try to move at all, you would definitely be an asshole. However, this seems like an honest mistake that you really tried to avoid once you noticed the situation. The coach had no right to lose their temper like that on you- a calm or stern warning would have sufficed. I\u2019d say in the future, pay great attention to where the program skater is on the ice when that coach is present to avoid this in the future. \n\nDefinitely NTA",

            "comment": "TLDR: NTA. You made a mistake. Figure out how to not repeat that mistake. This is how you learn. Yelling is bad.\n\nI want to say that yelling at someone is almost never appropriate. Full stop. Even if you were in the wrong it wasn't appropriate for the adult to yell at you. The only time yelling is appropriate is to warn someone about immediate danger. Everything else can be communicated in a calm and respectful manner.\n\nIn the future if someone yells at you, it is appropriate to say something like, \"I hear that you are angry and frustrated right now. My intention was not to do X. I would be happy to discuss what I could have done differently when you are calm. I am not going to allow you to yell at me.\" \n\nWhen you give/receive feedback it is important for it to be timely, specific, and actionable. What did you do specifically? What was the impact/outcome? What could have been done differently? Being yelled at or dressed down isn't helpful. Having a calm conversation about what happened and how it could be avoided in the future (maybe the other coach could have given your coach a heads up about where the other skater would be so you could avoid crossing paths?). \n\nFeedback is hugely important in how we grow and learn as humans. Learning how to communicate effectively and navigate feedback in useful manner is the best skill to cultivate, especially when you are wrong. It is also a big part of accountability which boils down to, I did a thing that harmed someone else and how to change my behavior to avoid that situation in the future.",

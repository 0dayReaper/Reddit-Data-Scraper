    "postText": "I bought a house in the countryside. Love it, love the garden (my dog does too), love the birds and other critters that visit. Not so much the cats.\n\nMy neighbourhood has several cats that roam free. Still pretty standard in the countryside. I like cats well enough, but I have about four or five of them (not mine) that use my garden as a highway to get between various other gardens, the park, and wherever else their kitty business takes them. I hate it because:\n\n1) They foul everywhere. Several of my neighbours let their cats out to poop, and they've chosen my garden as their kitty toilet. Yeah, not a fan. Might get better once I finish fixing it up and start using it more, but it ain't great.\n\n2) They attack the other wildlife. I've seen those damn cats from my kitchen window, watched them stalking and leaping at birds. I like birds. I also like the hedgehogs and squirrels that scurry about. Stupid cats.\n\nI've started looking at cat repellants that are little machines which emit a sound cats don't like, effectively keeping them away but not bothering other animals. Also looking at blocking off gaps in the hedge and only leaving little hedgehog tunnels.\n\nThe problem with this is that with my garden smack bang in the middle of all other gardens (it's a row house situation, with my garden bordered on all sides by others), I'm cutting off the only access route for all neighbour cats. They'll all be stuck in their own gardens (have fun dealing with your own pets' poop for a change, neighbours) or will have to find alternate routes along the front of their houses next to the road. That's the part in particular that makes me hesitate.\n\nWould I be the asshole for blocking and repelling neighbourhood cats from my garden?",

Letting cats outside freely at the very least makes a person an ignorant asshole.\n\nBecause they are non-native species in many places, loose cats wreak havoc on ecosystems. They kill birds and other small animals by the millions. Cats aren't \"evil\" or whatever, but they really enjoy killing things for fun. It's cat behavior. Even big cats do this. \n\nIt is also really unsafe for cats to be outside without being harnessed or otherwise contained. So many things will kill your cat in an instant. Cats can catch fatal diseases from other animals. Cats can eat poisonous substances. Cats can be ripped apart by unleashed dogs or other predators. Cats can be stolen by fucked up people who want to hurt them. Why would a reasonable person risk that? I love my kitties.

I live in a rural area where having outdoor cats is still common. They are happy animals. They get lots of love and attention, are well-fed, are taken to the vet when they're sick, etc. I do not think cats, generally speaking, should be outdoor animals because there are risks, but they aren't uncared for. \n\nNow lets talk about shelter life: overcrowded, little space, exposure to illness via the sheer number of uncared for cats coming in, not enough attention to go around...it's not a good life. That is no fault of the shelters, it's simply the way things are due to the sheer number of animals they have to care for verses the lack of resources. \n\nWhile shelter and possible euthanasia may be the more humane route for feral cats in bad circumstances, it is not the more humane route for cared-for outdoor cats. Plus, at that point, you're wasting shelter resources. If you drop off a well-cared for outdoor cat at a shelter they now have to pay for food and vet care the cat was already getting. And there is one less spot open for a feral cat who could not otherwise get food and vet care. \n\nJust because a situation isn't *ideal* doesn't mean it's *terrible* or worse than shelter life.",

When I finish off a jar of garlic powder (or any other spice) - I wash it, snap off the closing part of the lid (keeping the hole part of the lid) - put 2 to 4 moth ball in the jar.

I prefer to use the spice jars that are glass - they last longer (many many years) vs. plastic (2 to 3 years).

Love it, love the garden (my dog does too), love the birds and other critters that visit. Not so much the cats.\n\nMy neighbourhood has several cats that roam free. Still pretty standard in the countryside. I like cats well enough, but I have about four or five of them (not mine) that use my garden as a highway to get between various other gardens, the park, and wherever else their kitty business takes them. I hate it because:\n\n1) They foul everywhere. Several of my neighbours let their cats out to poop, and they've chosen my garden as their kitty toilet. Yeah, not a fan. Might get better once I finish fixing it up and start using it more, but it ain't great.\n\n2) They attack the other wildlife. I've seen those damn cats from my kitchen window, watched them stalking and leaping at birds. I like birds. I also like the hedgehogs and squirrels that scurry about. Stupid cats.\n\nI've started looking at cat repellants that are little machines which emit a sound cats don't like, effectively keeping them away but not bothering other animals. Also looking at blocking off gaps in the hedge and only leaving little hedgehog tunnels.\n\nThe problem with this is that with my garden smack bang in the middle of all other gardens (it's a row house situation, with my garden bordered on all sides by others), I'm cutting off the only access route for all neighbour cats. They'll all be stuck in their own gardens (have fun dealing with your own pets' poop or a change, neighbours) or will have to find alternate routes along the front of their houses next to the road. That's the part in particular that makes me hesitate.\n\nWould I be the asshole for blocking and repelling neighbourhood cats from my garden?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They're extremely loud and irritating and would ruin my sleep if one of my neighbors had one. Your dogs would hear it and have to live with it every day. The birds and hedgehogs might be repelled too\n\nIs there a good spot you could put a motion sensor sprinkler? Or maybe the repellant alarm could have a motion sensor so it's not going off all the time? Not sure on the best solution",

Button up the holes in the fence, add a small, chicken wire enclosed hallway of sorts to the back of your property that not only keeps the \"highway\" open, but blocks them from your garden at all times. Best of both worlds. Just a little 1ft by 1ft enclosure along the back fence area that you won't see anyway. Add some shrubs nearby, maybe some climbing ivy so its hidden from you. \n\nWork with the environment you moved into!",

For the rest, NAH. \n\nIn the USA and Australia there's a huge push for indoor cats due to safety and wildlife. In the UK (where I think OP is because hedgehogs and spelling) it is considered cruel to cats by many people--I've had a lot of arguments with my English in-laws because we have indoor only cats and the RSPCA doesn't recommend it as a general rule for all cats (whereas the ASPCA and Humane Society do say all cats should be kept indoors). \n\nYou can try to keep cats out, but cats are excellent at climbing over walls and fences and may well ignore cat unfriendly plants (please don't plant anything actually poisonous). You bought in a rural area where the cats are used to being free roaming. You may well be fighting a losing battle, and you need to weigh up the risk of turning this into a war against your neighbors. My childhood cat was indoor/outdoor, and no fence kept him out of someone's yard. \n\nPlease note that as I said I keep my own cats indoors so this is not at all personal, but I know exactly how people in my in-laws' village would react to being told to keep their cats out of someone's garden and I've witnessed way too many indoor cat arguments. I've been told by English people that keeping cats indoors is abusive and unnatural. It's not a fight you're likely to win if that's where you are.",

    "postText": "A close friend went through a nasty divorce last year, and her and her ex-husband could no longer take care of their dog due to work and scheduling conflicts. \n\nThey asked me if I could adopt the dog, to which I agreed. I also agreed that anytime they wanted to check on the dog or if they wanted it back at some reasonable point I'd be glad to return it to them, as long as I was reassured the pup wasn't going to be neglected for the same reasons I was given last year.\n\nFast forward to present day, after a couple visits, my friend wants the dog back as she's changed a few things in her career that would allow her to keep the dog full time. I had no problems with it. However, I asked to be reimbursed for all expenses I incurred when the dog was under my care. Some of these expenses are: castration surgery, vet, pet insurance, food, suplements, toys, and some other supplies. I also crate and potty trained the dog, as well as establisbed a very structured routine, which is something it didn't have before; so I'm asking for some sort of additional compensation for taking care of it all this time.\n\nMy friend says I'm being unreasonable and an AH and I shouldn't be reimbursed as it was my decision to incur those expenses, and that I had agreed to return the dog to them whenever any of them were ready.  I'm not planning to hold the dog hostage and one way or another, I'll give it back, but if my friend doesn't see my side, I am ready to cut them out of my life. AITA?\n\nEdit: grammar\n\nEdit 2 for clarification: Thanks everybody for their input. While I did not flat out state that she should reimburse me should she or her ex-husband want the dog back, I DID offer dogsitting for however long they needed (within reason and with them covering all expenses) at the beginning to let them figure things out first. Both refused and insisted on rehoming, or they would look for someone else to rehome the dog. After reading y'all, I agree I could be TA for asking for compensation, but I think I'm within my rights to ask for reasonable expenses to be covered, as many of you stated below. Thanks all!",

Even if you initially offered them dogsitting, by your own account, it sounds like you eventually agreed to outright adopt the dog with the caveat that your friend or her ex could take back the dog if they changed their mind. This sounds like a case of bad communication. If the nasty divorce started last year then you\u2019ve had the dog for at least six months which is not an insignificant amount of time. \n\nOn one hand, you can\u2019t expect people to know or honour your expectations if you don\u2019t communicate them clearly BUT I also think your friend isn\u2019t being fair to ask for the dog back without offering to cover some of the bigger costs you incurred.",

Second, you have had the joy and companionship of the dog for a year. There is a cost to having the joy and companionship of a dog.   \n\n\nA few years ago, I adopted a dog from a rescue. The adoption fee was a few hundred dollars. I also bought a collar, leash, food bowls, food, toys, etc for the dog. After 48 hours, it was clear that I was very, very allergic to this sweet pup. I called the rescue org and explained the situation. They came to pick up the dog and had my check in hand. I said, \"Absolutely not! Keep the check as a donation and here are all of the supplies I purchased.\" If you are not willing to spend money on a dog, please don't get one.   \n\n\n(Happy ending...discovered that I am NOT allergic to a couple of specific breeds. I have adopted two of them. No wheezing!!! Happy, happy pups who live like royalty)",

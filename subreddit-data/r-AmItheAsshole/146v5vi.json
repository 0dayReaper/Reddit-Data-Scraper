If you just put them through the mail slot, it will come off as passive aggressive.\n\nIf at all possible, I'd try to have some sort of a friendly conversation (i.e. compliment her) a week or two before you ask.  Maybe this is overly cautious of me... but I'd want to set this request up for the best chance of success.  Otherwise you may have someone slamming doors to spite you.",

Hope it didn't scare you.\" Further thin walls discussions until the cabinet door suggestion feels natural. But, maybe I'm just overly cautious too.",

It's more likely there's not enough insulation between the walls. Before you address it with her, take steps towards mediating the sound on your own. Like sleeping with a fan, putting plush rugs down on the floor, and even curtains, all of which can help dampen sound--you could be surprised how much it can help. See if that works before you ask someone to change a mundane activity, if it doesn't then ask. It gives you more ammo to outline everything you've done before you ask her to do something.",

            "comment": "NTA. Your health is important, and you are not obligated to drop everything to do their bidding. That said families are complicated, especially when they are inconsiderate. \n\nThe fact is that asthma and allergies are serious and sometimes disabling. Sadly, many people think of it as a mild childhood condition where you cough too much (it is obviously way more than that). The fact that your mother smokes inside , let alone with an asthmatic child is abhorrent. I think moving out is the only way to get away from that, but it is easier said than done. \n\nSo, what to do for this in the meantime? For context I have brittle asthma and an immune disorder that causes extreme allergic reactions, which triggers my asthma. If you can afford it, an air purifier with a HEPA filter in it will probably improve your symptoms. It has worked wonders for me, and I have cats, despite being mildly allergic, and am severely allergic to dust mites. The one I bought was AUD $109, and works wonders. \n\nIf your parents are unwilling to make the environment better for you by their actions, buying an air purifier for you might seen as a fair trade for looking after the family dog in their eyes. To be honest it is something everyone with respiratory disease should be given. Do you have a preventer and anti-histamines? That can help too.\n\nI hope it gets better for you!",

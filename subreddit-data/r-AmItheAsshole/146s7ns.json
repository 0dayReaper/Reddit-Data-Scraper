    "postText": "I'm a father with primary custody of a 13 year old daughter. She's had terrible trouble with ear infections and strep. The Dr recommended a tonsillectomy. It is not an emergency,  but will improve her health as she gets older.\n\nMy ex wife and I agreed to let our daughter decide. She is scared, but ultimately decided she wanted it. Called the ENT, and they gave me two dates. The first one was on a day she has an orthopedic appt, and the second 8 days later. We picked the latter. \nAfter I hung up, I remembered it was her mother's birthday. Our daughter said it was fine, they would be with her the day before anyway, and could celebrate then\n\nHer mother had a fit. She said I need to move it, because if something went wrong, it would be a bad memory on her birthday. If I don't move it, she will not pay her share, because she won't agree to it on that day. She said since it's just an elective surgery, she doesn't have to agree anymore if it's on a day she doesn't want.\n\nI'm leaving the date alone, as our daughter wants the extra week to prepare herself for being in pain for 2 weeks.\n\nSo...am I the a-hole?",

You would be surprised how superstitious people are in general, let alone when fear comes in.  It sounds like mom isn\u2019t bummed her daughter won\u2019t be there for cake, she\u2019s afraid her daughter will die on her birthday.  People often avoid doing things in birthdays and holidays for this very reason.  I don\u2019t think mom is immature, but she\u2019s letting her emotions rule her.  Also, fwiw, it would be strange if mom wasn\u2019t worried about her kid getting surgery!  My caseload is mostly moms and even something as simple as kid getting a wart removed with a local often causes anxiety.",

I agree that mom is overreacting, but in a sense I don't fully blame her. I most definitely would not want to be in the hospital on my birthday. Well, I have been in that situation with no choice &amp; it does suck big time. It's \"elective\" in the sense that it isn't emergency, but they should really just reschedule the ortho appt for the sake of keeping the peace, imo.",

They literally had an appointment like two days later because of a cancellation. Same with orthopedics when he later sprained his ankle. But, we also know that h only got those due to cancellations. Who knows how long it could have taken of people didn't cancel. I have to wait until i give birth to get a referral for an ENT because i keep getting ear infections and I'm worried it'll take months because specialists are insanely busy",

It\u2019s HARD to get a specialist appointment if it\u2019s not an emergency or high-priority. I can see not wanting to cancel the specialist appointment. I do understand Mom not wanting to associate her birthday with that fear, but if the option is to reschedule and have her daughter possibly get strep throat a few times while waiting, that sucks too. Maybe see if Mom can be educated on the procedure, how quick and low risk it is, to see if that will help?",

It took my mum a few years to get over being twitchy on their anniversary, the first time around. I didn't intend to ruin the date for her, but I kinda did. (Dad thought it was funny, once I'd recovered. The second time, so did she. I'm still not \"allowed\" to *schedule* anything for that date, though.)",

Have you ever suffered an ear infection? It is very uncomfortable and often painful as well. And it is not like the daughter had 12 different dates to choose from. The daughter chose one of the two dates that she was given the fact that she already had a doctor's appointment on the earlier date. The second date sounds like the earliest next date available by the provider *and* feasible for the daughter to get the tonsillectomy and take care of the ear infection.\n \nThe mom throwing a fit for *any reason* is immature about matters like this where she really needs to put her own desires aside to focus on helping her daughter feel better. Throwing a fit and refusing to pay her share for the surgery because something may go wrong and that will taint her birthday is even more immature and selfish. \n\nOP, NTA.",

My grandmother died on my birthday and I can tell you it sucks because it never fails that when we have a gathering for my birthday, there's always someone that starts crying because they start reminiscing about grandma, usually my mom and sister. There is always a cloud hanging over my birthday now. It's a simple ask and it's not that big a deal to rearrange schedules. They could move the orthopedic appointment and do it that day, or put off the tonsillectomy for the next available opening. I guarantee they're not booked for the rest of the year. The two dates OP gave are just the first openings available.",

I always encourage parents to do their own work and manage their own anxieties as this could be a projection of caregiver anxiety that is not healthy or helpful in this situation. Difficult to know though without finding out more info. Without knowing more I do wonder if they don't do the surgery if it would be considered medical neglect (I know this definition is different depending on where we practice) or if it would be considered \u201celective\u201d therefore less rigid in the eyes of child protection.",

She will have to pay her share whether she likes it or not. \n\nThis isn't something cosmetic. Just because it's not emergency surgery doesn't mean it's not necessary. If her providers have referred her for this, it's something she needs.",

I'm convinced that it permanently weakened my immune system since I still get respiratory infections easily and I was much sicker for much longer when I got Covid than anyone else around me.\n\nIt's much better for your daughter's health to get this done ASAP. The risk of complications is small. Good luck to your daughter! (Stock up on ice cream and smoothie ingredients!)",

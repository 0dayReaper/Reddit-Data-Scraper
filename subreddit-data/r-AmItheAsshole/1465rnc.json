I live 3 hours away and don\u2019t drive. My grandmother (67) called me at 6:30 pm the other night asking if I would like to go visit my memere before she passes and that she requested to see my sister (26f) and I. We started to make plans for what time we would be going when she asked me if my husband will be able to get my son(7) off the bus that afternoon. I said no he has work.. she gives me no response. \n\nShe does not like children and is not involved in any way a grandparent would be and called my siblings and I monsters until we were late into our teens and turned into \u201chumans\u201d. So I know she doesn\u2019t want my child going for the ride and I tell her that I guess I will just try to FaceTime my aunt to talk to memere. She responds with \u201cwell you did get to talk to her last week\u201d and left it at that. \n\nWe had plans before to visit my memere on Mother\u2019s Day and they also fell through due to her not wanting to be around my son.

Your grandmothrrs sounds like a very unpleasant person and YWNBTAH if you went LC or NC. But everything else is just a bit of a mess. She didn't explicitly tell you you can't bring your son.  Maybe you shouldn't have assumed. Also maybe you could have tried to find a sitter for him until husband came home and not given up on the chance to visit so easily.  Or tried to find another way to get there and visit on your own.",

    "postText": "\r  \nI always thought my sister (27F) and I (25M) had a decently close relationship until a few years ago when it came out that she thought of me as a \"golden child.\" She held resentment towards me for things I just looked at as the typical more lax treatment of the younger child in a family. I honestly thought the whole thing was pretty silly, especially since we were both years out of being under our parents' roof at this point, so we went a while without talking. We saw each other at family events but didn't really speak. \r  \n\r  \nI was invited to her engagement party as a form of an olive branch extension. It was there I met her future husband's younger brother, and we immediately got along. The two of us got to know each other and spent about a year as friends before making things official around a month before my sister's wedding.\r  \n\r  \nI love his family so much. His parents are warm and inviting in a way that feels so genuine, even before I was introduced as a significant other. (Not to knock my parents, but with them being lawyers and working politically adjacent careers, it can be easy to become jaded when you watch them schmooze to people's faces even when that doesn't reflect their true feelings.) I was the first person he ever brought home to meet them and they made me feel like part of the family immediately. Their youngest brother has been equally as welcoming and regularly schools me in Overwatch 2 by staying alive far longer than I ever could. \r  \n\r  \nWhen I told my sister this, thinking it was something we could bond over, she was angry again. Apparently she didn't receive the same treatment. This resulted in a big argument which led to her saying something to the effect of \"I guess this is what happens when two golden children get together.\" I pushed back against this, and it further devolved with her pointing out that out of all the people in the world, she couldn't believe I had chosen her husband's brother. She said I had stolen opportunities from her growing up and now I was \"stealing\" her in-laws.\r  \n\r  \nI considered telling my partner's parents about this at one point to let them know the animosity my sister apparently holds towards them, but I decided against it. I don't really know where I stand in this conflict and at this point I'd just like some outside perspective.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?",

Siblings should get differential and special treatment (barring disabilities ofc and even then the other children should never feel neglected) and to shrug this off as \u201cyoung sibling\u201d stuff seems really dismissive and purposefully unforthcoming.

The term implies the parents are older/more tired so they don\u2019t parent the youngest as strictly. This is generally applied to families that have multiple years between first and last children. My partner was 13 when his youngest brother was born. He definitely experienced the difference. \n\nOP is the golden child but refuses to see it/acknowledge it.\n\nYTA, OP.

Between when my middle sister was old enough to start forming recallable memories and when my youngest sister did, our parents financial situation changed a LOT. This meant little sis always got more than either of us older ones, especially since their financial situation kept improving, so little sis always had more than we did at the same age.\n\nIn addition, I have AuDHD, a diagnosis that didn\u2019t even exist then (you could have one or the other, not both) and was forever getting into trouble because I didn\u2019t understand how I was supposed to behave. Middle sis is a drama queen (always was, always will be, and these days I adore her for it) and had a lot of LDs. Baby sis was and is a sweetheart, and was the easiest kid. So my parents were a lot easier on her due to her personality, her being an overall easier kid, and my parents being more experienced.\n\nBaby sis is the only Gen Z of us, so she was also reaching milestones in a very different world than we did. Both middle sis and I have pre-9/11 memories. She doesn\u2019t. How we were raised reflected that change. \n\nSo it\u2019s very possible for parenting styles to change drastically, even within a short span.

That sounds like they decided to date exclusively, not get engaged. Why would he put that off, because his sister is getting married in a month?  Stealing experiences as a kid? Thats on the parents. Stealing experiences as an adult?  They are making their own relationships. Sister needs to stop worrying about what she is missing, get some therapy, and build her own relationships. OP says he was welcomed by the in laws, but doesnt say that he even knew sister wasnt. Maybe the sister is an entitled, unreasonable person\u2026 sister needs some therapy.",

I don\u2019t think she\u2019s inherently bad for that, it is something she should work on, but I don\u2019t think either one of you are in the wrong for everything listed here.\n\nOur childhoods have a lot to do with the people we become. It\u2019s foundational. It sounds like your sister spent much of her life feeling like she\u2019s in last place. Not even her own family treated her like she was special. What may have been a random Tuesday for you during your childhood may be a core memory for her. It\u2019s not cool to dismiss her feelings as silly.\n\nShe has the same parents as you, who you called fake and schmoozy, so you can understand her excitement at having a second chance at connecting with a family. And then you, the person who always took first place when it came to familial love, shows up and wins them over.\n\nYour sister hasn\u2019t responded in the most emotionally intelligent way. In-laws can like more than one person, and sometimes relationships take a while to develop. She\u2019s also a month away from her wedding. She\u2019s stressed and not handling things well. That doesn\u2019t give her free reign to be a jerk, but it\u2019s something to be mindful of.\n\nYou can\u2019t help that you and her fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother connected so it\u2019s not cool that she said that. But it seems like she\u2019s just speaking from frustration.\n\nYour sister doesn\u2019t hold animosity towards the in-laws. Seems like she just wants to be liked. I\u2019m glad you decided against telling the in-laws because what would that really accomplish? \n\nTLDR: Your sis sounds insecure. Try approaching with compassion. NTA unless you tattle.",

You said you were contemplating telling your parents about the situation just so they are aware of the animosity, which makes sense to me. When me and my sibling had our fallout, we both let our parents know just so they knew that me and my sibling were no longer talking to each other. Now if you do this in a more tattling manner like comments are pointing out (i.e. running to mom and dad and going \"sib is doing this thing jsyk) that is probably a dick move as you both are adults. But just giving your parents a heads up you and your sister aren't on speaking terms seems reasonable to me. As for everything else, your sister seems rude for claiming you're stealing her in-laws. If the in-laws didn't respond to her the same way they did you, that's in no way anything to do with you. Some people just click better than others. And you were just trying to have something to click with your sister on which is a nice thing to try and do and something I can relate to. I can't really tell if you're the golden child and frankly whether you are or aren't really doesn't affect this situation. Idk, that's my two cents at least\n\nEdit: I reread and saw that it says tell partner's parents not OP's parents. That would be a major dick move I'd like to say. If OP did decide to tell them I'd say YTA, but since that hasn't happened I'm still going with NTA. So NTA with a side of WBTA.

That is what making me think that you are manipulating the narrative, look just try not the make more drama, just stop talking to your sister, she is very wary of you, and she doesn't see you as sister but competition.\n\nAnd if this relationship is serious then try to divide your relationship with your sister and your in-laws, but i think you a little YTA, because in the end of the day, you should have a great distance from your sister, because in the end of the day she doesn't want you in her space.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\n\r  \nI always thought my sister (27F) and I (25M) had a decently close relationship until a few years ago when it came out that she thought of me as a \"golden child.\" She held resentment towards me for things I just looked at as the typical more lax treatment of the younger child in a family. I honestly thought the whole thing was pretty silly, especially since we were both years out of being under our parents' roof at this point, so we went a while without talking. We saw each other at family events but didn't really speak. \r  \n\r  \nI was invited to her engagement party as a form of an olive branch extension. It was there I met her future husband's younger brother, and we immediately got along. The two of us got to know each other and spent about a year as friends before making things official around a month before my sister's wedding.\r  \n\r  \nI love his family so much. His parents are warm and inviting in a way that feels so genuine, even before I was introduced as a significant other. (Not to knock my parents, but with them being lawyers and working politically adjacent careers, it can be easy to become jaded when you watch them schmooze to people's faces even when that doesn't reflect their true feelings.) I was the first person he ever brought home to meet them and they made me feel like part of the family immediately. Their youngest brother has been equally as welcoming and regularly schools me in Overwatch 2 by staying alive far longer than I ever could. \r  \n\r  \nWhen I told my sister this, thinking it was something we could bond over, she was angry again. Apparently she didn't receive the same treatment. This resulted in a big argument which led to her saying something to the effect of \"I guess this is what happens when two golden children get together.\" I pushed back against this, and it further devolved with her pointing out that out of all the people in the world, she couldn't believe I had chosen her husband's brother. She said I had stolen opportunities from her growing up and now I was \"stealing\" her in-laws.\r  \n\r  \nI considered telling my partner's parents about this at one point to let them know the animosity my sister apparently holds towards them, but I decided against it. I don't really know where I stand in this conflict and at this point I'd just like some outside perspective.\r  \n\r  \nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My question to you is... why do you hate and despise your sister SO much that you try to hurt her at every opportunity you can? WHY? Is it to get her out of your life permanently so that you can hog the limelight forever? If so, you need to do some very serious introspection and definitely some therapy as to why you are so intentionally cruel to your only sibling. What has she ever done to you to deserve such horrid treatment from you? Grow the eff up and learn how to be a compassionate, caring adult to your only sibling and sister. Maybe you are far too self-absorbed and narcissistic to make drastic changes to your personality that are very much needed. Don't be surprised if she cuts you out of her life permanently.",

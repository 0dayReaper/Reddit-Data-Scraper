    "postText": "My boyfriend (20) and I (also 20) have been together for 2 years. We received news a few months that we\u2019re expecting. I never wanted kids, but I figured it was better to have them young than anything else.\n\nWe found out not that long ago that we were expecting a girl. My boyfriends mother has always wanted a granddaughter as she had two boys and my boyfriends brother doesn\u2019t want kids period. However, my boyfriend and I decided to keep the gender of the baby a secret until she\u2019s born.\n\nOne evening recently, my boyfriend and I went out to dinner with his parents and the discussion of baby names came up.\n\nMy boyfriends mother kept asking what the gender was to be able to decide a name. We explained that we wouldn\u2019t be announcing the gender until birth. She kept insisting we tell her as she needed to help with the name picking process. We explained to her that we were to decide the names, and it was our decision only. We also addressed that if it was a boy, it we would have Scott as the middle name as that was my fathers name - he passed from cancer when I was 13. My future mother in law stated that if I \u201cget to name the damn baby after him, then the girls name should be McKenna.\u201d\n\nMy boyfriends mother was pregnant around 18 years ago and lost the baby during childbirth. The baby would\u2019ve been a girl and she was going to be named McKenna. It\u2019s a heartbreaking story and I feel so horrible that she had to experience that. However, I didn\u2019t want my daughter to be named McKenna. I dislike the name, no offense, and my boyfriend had no connection with the baby. He was too young to even know what happened. Regardless of my opinion, if my boyfriend wanted to name our child after one of his loved ones, he could\u2019ve stated that - but he hasn\u2019t.\n\nShe insisted I was rude and selfish for not even considering McKenna as a name and that her baby had just as much of a right to be honored as my father.\n\nMy boyfriend kept insisting that the idea was ridiculous; I was very close with my father. He was sick for years and I even had to watch him die, so naming a son after him would be him living on. He passed at 38, so it\u2019s to honor him. My boyfriend never even knew his mother was pregnant until after everything because he was so young and that the name McKenna had never even been brought up in their household until now.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not using the name my future mother in law picked for her unborn child?",

I was born first with two X chromosomes, and my brother was born 7 years later. \n\nMy grandmother fought over my name so I was named something vindictive to upset her. I was named after the precinct her abusive husband was captain of. \n\nShe still tried. I had over 50 frilly dresses and adult makeup at the age 6. She'd dress me up and take me out to her work/volunteer events. Tell me people I was \"the daughter of her dreams\" because I was well behaved. Age 8 I put my foot down and would not behave if I had to wear a dress or makeup. I hated it.\n\nHell broke out when my cousin came out as Trans. Grandma was always forwarded a bigot, so we knew it wouldn't go well but cousin tried to play the \"well you always wanted a daughter, so now you have 2\" angle. \n\nNope. Gonna be a bigot? Lose your daughter.\n\nSo I said fudge it and told her I was Agender. I am not a woman and she is not to call me that. Told her I'm pansexual, so I'll date men, women AND Trans people too. Cousin jumped in to say she is pansexual too. \n\nShe flipped. I'm no longer worthy of her time. Now my brother is her \"new favourite\"\n\nWait until he tells her he is bi and is in a throuple with a man and a woman.",

She wanted to name me Flora but my dad vetoed it and refused to sign my birth certificate because he believed he had a say in my name. Mum didn't agree, but his threat stood and they went for her second choice (which was also dad's second choice). \n\nWhen we told her we were having a boy she insisted on her 1st choice of boy name \"Michael\" since she never got to use it either. I told her that unless her name was on his birth certificate she didn't get a say. She threatened to not come to rhe birth, but I told her she wasn't invited anyway. When my son was born, she calmed down. \n\nShe then started insisting that we immediately start trying for \"A Little Flora\", and even started buying floral girls clothes and personalised stuff with the name \"Flora\". I said to her \"want to come ro rhe conception to make sure we do it correctly to have a girl?\" She said I was being ridiculous. \n\nMy husband and I haven't been the same since my son was born, so whether we wanted to or not, I doubt there will be any kind of \"Flora\" or \"Michael\" on the horizon any time soon anyway",

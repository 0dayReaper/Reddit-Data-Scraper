This guy is just making crappy excuses to justify his behavior. if he truely felt so bad about what he said. Why couldn't he have listed what he did wrong? \n\nNta I'm a man myself and I like to be helpful as much as I can. however i was raised to ask if somebody needed help, not asserting myself into a situation where I'm not needed.  What if he lost his balance and dropped what you were carrying by doing that stunt of grabbing something outta your hands?\n \nHopefully this guy doesn't pester you to forgive him..",

I also acknowledge that carrying a 10kg bench is not a problem at all for the average women and that being so over-protective is silly.\n\nSo yeah, his initial action was exaggerated and he could have asked you if you wanted help instead of taking the bench out of your hands. But his later actions show that  he didn't intend to offend you, he was trying to be a gentleman the way he had learned it. He sounds like he accepted your decision that YOU didn't want to be treated that way.\n\nYTA for feeling so morally superior to him. I know many women, even from younger generations, that would appreciate a man taking care of them and saying heavy lifting is men's work. The man does not have to change his general, slightly old fashioned world fiew and his general behaviour towards ALL women, just because you took offence. \n\nOf course I'd expect him to accept it when a women does not want to be called girl or get her load taken from her. But he should get the chance to be told so by the individual person.",

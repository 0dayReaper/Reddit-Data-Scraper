Because my mother who is overweight and getting worse, refuses to go to the gym because I quote; \"the gym is not for me, I've done it all before, been to classes, running, exercises, sports but I don't enjoy it and you have to be in to something to be able to do it.\"So my argument to that is that you don't have to enjoy anything about the gym to go to the gym as I believe the only motive you need for going to the gym is wanting to better yourself.For context she does practically nothing all day until around 2pm where she then goes to work until half 6. I personally know this is just pure laziness on her part but I want to be certain that I'm not being toxic and just thinking that way and perhaps she is right that she does need to have some sort of enjoyment out of it.I personally feel this way because I am incapable of feeling enjoyment due to my depression atleast I certainly struggle to identify enjoyment whenever I am feeling it. I just go to the gym because it feels more like a good routine, it is making me stronger, it gives me something to do with myself and I would like to try to be a bit more healthy. I can't say I enjoy it because on some days I'm eager to go and others I'm not and it feels like a chore.But I digress, do you think you have to be 'into the gym' to get fit and healthy or is this just her being lazy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit- It's not just a gym thing. It's any sort of movement at all. I only wish for her to be a bit healthier ( she is obese ) she has fallen a few times and I can't help her to move into bed afterwards. ",

And she's kinda right - you have to enjoy the experience, or enjoy what the experience is giving you, for it to be sustainable. You might have to force yourself to go sometimes, but you know that you will enjoy the benefits of going. That is why the gym is sustainable for you. If your mum doesn't have the same mentality then nothing you say will make any difference, and pushing it will make her fight it more.",

Daughter bought a fancy  treadmill with a big screen computer program. She showed it off to me. I had some health issues happen and decided I wanted to walk. Our town is very hilly and I didn't enjoy it.  Daughter showed me a walking program on her treadmill. In the beginning I could only walk half a mile. I now walk 5 miles and enjoy every minute of it.",

There are so many social pressures from all directions, and so smelly and loud, ugh. The very thought is hell for me.\n\nBut I do exercise. I take walks when the weather is good, and every other day or so I have a routine I do with crunches and hand weights I have at home. When I walk I can turn on an audiobook or music and space out, and lifting weights at home lets me do things on my own terms too.\n\nBecoming active isn't just about routine. It's about finding what works best for you. Even if it's something small, like walking around the house or playing a physical video game like RingFit on the Switch.\n\nI don't know what kind of physical condition your mom is in, or her mental hangups as far as her weight. Being overweight is a mental strain as well as a physical one, and insecurities and trauma can play a huge part in one's willingness to make any attempt at improving physical fitness.\n\nMy advice to you is this: Meet her where she's at. Encourage her to pursue something physical that aligns with her interests. Walks, taking pictures, gardening, hell even Pokemon Go.\n\nNTA for being worried about your mom's health, but stop talking about the gym since that's clearly not working.",

Trying to get your mom to do something she's dead set against is only going to cause issues between you and her.",

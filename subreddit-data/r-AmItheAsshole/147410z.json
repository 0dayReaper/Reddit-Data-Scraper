Also, making jokes with your friends behind her back isn\u2019t cool but I do get it. Let\u2019s break it down: you can\u2019t go to your house with her but you can\u2019t stay at hers, so it\u2019s probably impacting your intimacy. She knows you\u2019re uncomfortable but isn\u2019t prepared to do anything about it for you. If you two stay together and move in at some point then you know you\u2019re going to end up breaking your back trying to keep the place clean around her. Maybe she\u2019ll change in time but it\u2019s doesn\u2019t sound like she even wants to work on herself or her hygiene at the moment. I don\u2019t know how attached you are after 6 months, but this would be well and truly fraying my patience at this point\u2026 But then again I do get mad anxiety about sleeping in a room with bugs present \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy girlfriend (20F) and I (20) have been together for almost six months. Our relationship is far from perfect but I\u2019ve always tried to adapt to her needs to the best of my ability, and of course she\u2019s done the same for me.\n\nFor some context: She has a thorough history of dealing with mental illnesses- having been admitted to several mental health institutions and she takes mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and 8(?) other pills each day. She isn\u2019t in college but she got a retail job recently and her schedule fluctuates between 30-40hrs a week. That\u2019s her only obligation \n\nI\u2019m a full time college student, I work full time+ overtime every week, I\u2019m on a hockey team, and I still make time for my family, friends, and of course my girlfriend. \n\nI was born into the middle-class, while she was born into the high upper class. I\u2019m only mentioning this because I feel like this contributes to our work ethic \n\nAnyways, here\u2019s the issue: her room is an absolute mess. You literally can\u2019t see the floor. There\u2019s clothes everywhere, fast food wrappers and bags, trash, makeup, etc. I\u2019ve never seen a bedroom that clustered before. There\u2019s like a whole ecosystem in there- an ant colony, a fly infestation in the connecting bathroom, spiders everywhere. I\u2019ve cleaned her bedroom two times- each taking 2&lt; hours, and I feel disrespected in a sense because her room gets filthy again within a week. I know she has enough free time to clean her room but she chooses to watch tv/smoke weed instead \n\nShe blames it on her depression and mental health issues. I understand that that can take a major toll on somebody but this is just ridiculous. It\u2019s been like this for the entire time I\u2019ve known her (9months)\n\nI\u2019m not even a neat-freak or anything, but this is absurd imo. I wake up to bug bites and there\u2019s food crumbs on her sheets \n\nSleeping over at my house (my parents house) isn\u2019t really a viable option because my parents just don\u2019t allow that. Fair, it\u2019s their house &amp; their rules \n\nSo I feel like my only option is to refuse to sleepover until she cleans her room. She\u2019s very clingy so this would really, really upset her. Is this considered discrimination against people with mental illnesses? Am I an asshole? Looking for advice, thanks\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

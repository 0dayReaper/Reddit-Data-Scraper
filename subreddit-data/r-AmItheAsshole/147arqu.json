We live together in my family house and are planning to do so until we are both graduated from college. We both are full time students, and he is in a very intense program. I however, have taken on an \u201ceasier\u201d degree so I work full time as well. Originally, he started the program and said that if things go well he will get a job while he is studying. That was over a year ago and he hasn\u2019t gotten a job. I don\u2019t mind as he has help from savings and we don\u2019t share any bills. \nThe problem comes in with the house work. Despite living with my family, we still have responsibilities. Since summer has started he has been playing video games from the minute he wakes up until he goes to bed. The trash is not taken out, laundry is on the floor, ect. I come home from work and have to pick up after him and make sure he has eaten and had enough water. For the first two years of our relationship we lived alone in our own apartment and he took much better care of himself and his belongings so I know he is very much so capable. \nWhen I asked him to start helping me more, he told me he wants me to put more effort into the materialistic aspect of our relationship. I used to bring him gifts and snacks home all the time and have since stopped as we are running out of room and he does not take out his trash. This all came to head today when we made our plan for the day to tackle all our responsibilities as it was my one day this week that I did not have prior commitments. Halfway through the day he laid in bed and claimed he was going to hang out with some friends in about an hour. I snapped and told him it was unfair that I am still working full time and taking summer courses and he doesn\u2019t have either of those nor is he picking up the slack at home. \n    He told me I was being mean and selfish and was upsetting him. This is when I told him to grow up or get out and if he doesn\u2019t start helping me more he needs to move out. Since I know he is fully capable of being a functional human being, I expect him to bring 50% of our responsibilities to the table - especially while he has no other job and is not in school. However I am beginning to think maybe I was too harsh and am being selfish because I am also capable of all the responsibilities. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

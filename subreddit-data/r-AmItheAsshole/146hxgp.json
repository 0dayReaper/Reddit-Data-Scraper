I can understand that she wants to have a say in when the lawn care, that her rent pays for, gets done, or at least have advance warning. I think you can just have a conversation about it going forward. Whether or not she was hungover isn't the issue. You could have just knocked on the a few days ago and worked out with her when a good time would be. You didn't have to guess.",

I have an agreement with the owner that I mow both front lawns to make a little extra money during the summer. I try to mow when my neighbor isn\u2019t home so I don\u2019t bother her, but I work full time and go to grad school in the evenings so I\u2019m limited to the weekends. I waited all day today for her to leave so I could cut the grass, but saw her car parked in the driveway all day so finally around 7pm I got out there and started mowing. She stomps outside and stands in front of me telling me to shut it off so I ask what the problem is. Apparently she is very hungover and the noise is bothering her and she wants me to stop. I tell her this is the only time I have to do it because I\u2019ll be out of town tomorrow (Sunday). It was very uncomfortable and obviously I wasn\u2019t trying to disturb her but it needed to be cut or I\u2019d have to wait another week. She has never once said thank you for taking care of her lawn, pulling weeds, trimming the bush and fertilizing. Am I the asshole for making noise?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The landlord can take responsibility of communicating to the tenant so they can plan their activities accordingly based on their tolerance for noise and hay-fever. And if it doesn't get done in the regular time slot, it'll get done in the alternate time slot.\n\nYou don't need to be pussyfooting around, waiting all day for them to leave the house, that's ridiculous.",

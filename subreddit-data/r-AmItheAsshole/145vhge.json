    "postText": "A friend (Jim) is getting married in Nov. This is a friend I've had for about five years. We were close for a time but have drifted apart and now talk once every three months.Here's the breakdown:\n\nJim had previously been generous and helpful whenever I was in turmoil. (No lending money or anything like that, but just taking me out to dinner and paying, that sort of thing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJim and his partner helped my partner and I visit properties while looking for houses and helped us move in when the time came.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy financial situation changed, and with my partner having the soul of a saint we have been nothing but generous with them whenever they've come to stay with us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImportant to note: Jim and his partner make substantially more money than we do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey live quite far in a different city, so whenever they come around we pay for petrol/food/accommodation. The last time they came over to see us we gave them a 7 course feast. Whenever we go out to dinner, we usually cop the bill. We never ever expect anything in return; it is just what you do, this is just how we treat our friends. It's my partner and I's sort of household philosophy to be as giving as you can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA specific example: We had bought them very expensive bottles of alcohol (think Cognac type) for a birthday. They gave me a $30 spiky acupuncture mat for my birthday that I opened once and have no use for. It is rotting in my cupboard as we speak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy partner and I are not the type of people to tit for tat cost. Jim and his partner are very... money-conscious. (and I understand and can respect their reasons for being like that even if I don't agree with it personally, it is not my place.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night Jim invited my partner and I to his city for suit picking for his wedding. The problem is that we are currently in a tough financial bind (which they are aware of) and we may not have the money to pay for the expense of travelling to them. We could always ask for the colour scheme and find matching suits but to be there for the suit picking seems like a great bonding experience and one of the only times we will all get together before the big day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy partner and I will go to the wedding and foot our individual cost for that, no questions asked. They are our friends - to see them celebrate their love for each other will be awesome. But considering the state we are in at the moment; it feels a little selfish for them to ask us to spend probably a few thousand dollars that we don't have without offering to take on some of that cost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I might be an asshole because our household philosophy of (mostly) unconditional generosity is in direct opposition to the idea of asking for the flights to be paid for because of the financial situation we're in. No, the generosity is not what has us in this situation. It was out of our control.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I talked to Jim about paying for the flights to visit for picking out suits?",

You may have swatches of the cloth sent to you for matching, or going to a tailor to get your measurements to forward to the shop where they purchase or rent the suits.   A philosophy of over generosity is nice if you can afford it, but you need to have savings first.",

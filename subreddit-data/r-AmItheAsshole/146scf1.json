I'd suggest getting a blanket or slipcover for the couch so they don't get it gross in the training process.\n\nMy dogs are allowed on my furniture. My mom has a no dog on the couch rule for her home. I do have a pretty well-trained dog that I pay attention to, and when I brought her to mom's place, Mom tossed slipcovers on her couches and I started teaching my dog that these were NOT couches she could hop onto at will.\n\nMy dog did (briefly) get on the furniture 2-3 times in the first week before she figured out that ALL the couches were no-dog zones. The cheap slip cover kept hair off the couch while she learned. 6 years later, my girl knows to flop on the fancy dog bed her grandma puts out for her instead of grandma's couch, every visit.\n\nIf your sister is lazy about training or managing her dogs, just have her bring them on nice days where you can all stay outdoors until the kids and dogs are worn out and ready to go home.",

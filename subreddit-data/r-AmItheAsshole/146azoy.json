    "postText": "I am a student living in a share student flat. Recently one of my flatmates invited 3 of her friends to move into our 5 bed flat (bring the total amount of people in the flat up to 7 as one of the original flatmates moved out). She's an international student so she bought plates and cutlery when she came here rather than bringing them from home. From what I remember she bought 4 of everything. \nBut now that her friends have moved in, she's been using my plates too and more annoyingly my baking tray. \nI don't mind her using my plates. They're very unique designs so I can pick them out on the dish rack quite easily. But she keeps using my baking tray and leaving raw chicken on it overnight before cooking it the next day. And then she won't clean it until the day after or whenever she next needs it. I'm vegan and I have allergies to onions, which she cooks with a lot. I find it so disrespectful that she would cook meat on my trays without asking to use my trays and also knowing that I'm vegan. \nI bought a pack of plastic plates (it was \u00a32 for 4) and said to her \"hey now you won't have to use my plates\" hoping that she would get the message but she said very bluntly \"oh but we were fine just using yours so there's really no need\". I'd like to just repeat here that at no point did she ever ask to use any of my things she just started using them when her friends moved in (she didn't even tell us they would be moving in which resulted in the scariest moment of my life seeing a stranger in the kitchen when I was half asleep making coffee). \nShe acts quite entitled to my stuff too. Sometimes if I cook with my baking tray before work I don't have a chance to wash it up until I get back (I put it aside out of the way and it's never been a problem with any of my flatmates) but she will message me asking to clean it so she can use it. \nAm I the asshole for asking her to stop using my kitchen stuff? Am I being petty? Is it really a big deal? I just can't stand seeing raw chicken left on my tray when I need my tray for my meals. I'm fed up of wasting my time preparing meals only to discover that my pots and pans are dirty or full of leftovers. Should I just give in and buy another tray or stand my ground? \ud83d\ude2d",

She's started to leave big pots and pans and appliances on the table so half the table is completely unusable but occasionally the whole table is just full of her cooking stuff. Do you think it would be a good idea if we all came together and talked to her about it or do you think that would just sour things entirely?",

If you can't use them when you need them because she got them dirty and didn't clean them, or they're full  of her leftovers, not allowing her to use them is a natural consequence. If you can lock them up, that would be best. I don't think she's going to respect any boundaries, she hasn't yet.",

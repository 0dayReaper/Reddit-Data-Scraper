Do not concede or offer to buy a new one; NTA\u2014 kids needs to learn consequences.

In mine (PA) CHIP really does cover all kids, but you pay a premium if your income is over a certain amount. The federal government requires that CHIP be offered to families with less than a certain income (I think 2X FPL) but states can and often do increase that. \n\nAs per CMS 35 million children are enrolled in Medicaid and another 9M are enrolled in CHIP. It's not at all a small number. The percentage of uninsured children ranges from 11.8% in TX to 1% in MA.",

Things that are meant to be submerged need a depth rating, and typically have to be fully sealed. (Dive watches. Your waterproof timex is only going to withstand you forgetting to remove it before you wash your hands, or the diahes...)\nNo standard phone case is that good. If you didn't know that before, you do now. \n\nSister should she been clear that she meant \"it's okay to have NEAR the pool, it won't be harmed if it gets splashed.\" \nBut also, who TF gives a kid that young that expensive a piece of technology? If she can afford to give a 6yo a current model iphone, I'm not sympathetic. Anything you give a 6yo is going to get ruined, because they are still learning!!!",

I am about 15 years younger than my other siblings and thief plan was to go to an outlet mall so I volunteered to stay and watch the kids (6, 6, 5 and 5).\n\nOne of the six year olds has a brand new iPhone 14 and I made a quick remark that I\u2019ll make sure he keeps it away from swimming. My sister\u2019s exact quote was \u201coh it\u2019s ok it has a -brand name- case on it, it can get wet.\u201d I said ok and told them to have a good time. The two six year olds came up with a pool game centered around that clock app trend that goes \u201coooooohhh weeeee,\u201d basically everyone the heard \u201cooooohhh weeee\u201d they\u2019d throw the phone up in the air and go dive for it.\n\nWell the case wasn\u2019t apparently that water proof and after about 10\nMins the phone was completely soaked inside the case and phone was dead and the back was so hot it felt like it could burn your finger.\n\nMy sister is livid with me and is expecting me to pay for the phone. I keep going back to the fact that she said the case was waterproof. She says I\u2019m a major asshole if i interpreted waterproof for an iPhone being used as a dive toy.\n\nAITA here ?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It can get a bit wet refers to a few drops of water. \n\nAlthough your sister is crazy for giving an iPhone 14 to a 6 year old, you should have know better than allow a 6 year old a phone near the pool. \n\nETA",

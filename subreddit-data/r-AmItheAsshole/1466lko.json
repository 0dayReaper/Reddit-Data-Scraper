Then if you are going to college, lots of financial aid and grants require your parent\u2019s signatures. I believe your parents have to sign on your fasfa unless you\u2019re married or can prove your 100% finically independent from your parent. \nAlso while you might be 18 and adult unless you are fully finically independent. Toe the lie with your parents, plan a way to get your finances in order and then you can truly control your own life and all your educational opportunities",

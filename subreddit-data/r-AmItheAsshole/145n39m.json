    "postText": "A week ago I moved into a new apartment with an old buddy of mine. For the first week things went perfectly fine but we had our first argument today.\n\nAs I got back to the building from work I ran into him running out of the elevator saying he had no time to talk and he had to catch a bus (he was going back to his home town for the week). Two minutes later, once I got up to the room, he gave me a call and told me he clogged the toilet and didn't have time to clean it up without missing his bus. I told him I'd clean it and that it was fine.\n\nIt took a few minutes to unclog but there was water from the toilet all over the bathroom floor and the wall outside of it by the time I finished at which point I realized that I only had one towel and I didn't know where his were. I certainly wasn't going to use mine!\n\nI called him three times but got no answer, at which point I texted him that if he didn't answer in a few minutes I would use his bedsheets to wipe the floor. I tried calling him one more time and still no answer, so I took the top sheet off his bed and wiped the bathroom floor with it.\n\nHe texted me ten minutes later to tell me where his towel was, but I told him it was too late. Turns out he had been in the subway/bus station where there was no reception. He was pissed that I used his sheets and didn't wait for him to answer. However, considering there is no bus to his home town from that station, he could have stayed back and unclogged it himself and took an Uber after to the station he was going to. I said I'd put his sheets through the washing machine when I do my laundry this weekend but he still seems pissed at me.\n\nAITA?",

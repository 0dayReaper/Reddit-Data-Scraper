    "postText": "I 22f have a car that my grandparents (60 something f and 70 something m) (they are my parental figures) sold to me back in 2020. When they sold it to me they promised they\u2019d get the air compressor replaced since it was bad before they sold me the car. They had promised they\u2019d have it done by summer.\n\nWell by summer some new issues had occurred and it also needs a full catalytic converter replacement. It still does because I don\u2019t ever have 2k laying around to get it fixed. I went to Vegas to visit my dad and when I came back I find out they were tricked into getting all new brakes for it by the shop that was working on the muffler. I knew they were tricked because I just paid for an entire brake replacement not even 3 months prior and obviously the brakes were fine while driving. This has become their scapegoat on not fixing the air. Keep in mind the air compressor is also around a 2k job which is why I didn\u2019t just get it fixed myself. \n\nWell now every time I bring it up they just start screaming at me and calling me ungrateful. I don\u2019t understand how I\u2019m ungrateful for simply expecting them to keep their word. I literally paid them $1000 for this car and only did so under the presumption the air was getting fixed. They constantly gaslight me and act as though they never even promised to do it to begin with. Whenever I say I\u2019m upset solely about them not doing what they promised to do they start threatening me with violence and continue screaming and fighting with me about it. They haven\u2019t admitted once to not doing as they promised. They just act like I made it up and then tell me I\u2019m ungrateful because they got the brakes (that didn\u2019t need done) fixed. All I want is my car to have air. It\u2019s been 3 years and the summers are getting hotter and hotter each year that passes. \n\nThis combined with other things has me heavily considering cutting all contact and never speaking to them again. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that I suffer due to their bad judgment and refusal to simply do what they promised they would. If the brakes actually were a problem they could\u2019ve simply fixed the air like they promised and then informed me of the brakes when I got home from my trip (but like I said nothing was actually wrong with the brakes)\n\nAfter all these years I\u2019m mainly just upset at them for promising me something (which with 90 degree summers id say its kind of necessary) and never coming through. It upsets me more that they refuse to take accountability for it and always start bringing up irrelevant things to make me feel bad.",

I have never had my own dog and I know about littermate syndrome. \n\nObviously a traumatized dog being aggressive is not the dog's fault, but I would blame the rescue for placing a dog in an unsuitable environment that could further traumatize the dog or lead to dangerous situations (ie placement of a dog reactive dog in a home with other dogs or a child reactive dog with children)\n\nAs much as I admire those with the patience to work with rescue animals I would hesitate to adopt a rescue dog that had not been vetted by the rescue and/or a behaviorist for signs of dog or child aggression since I have a toddler.  It's just not worth the risk.",

You may be fighting the idea since you deep down feel the marriage is over? Are you fighting the idea since your husband always manipulates you? Is your daughter just being manipulative??? Is your husband using your daughter to manipulate you??? You have a lot of emotions to go thru besides just the dogs. So someone asking you to change (get rid of dogs) and you saying no thanks is well witching your rights. These are high stakes.",

Is a removing/rehoming a dog really going to save the marriage and family? Or is it a temporary band aid where in a few months you still have issues? I don't want to encourage picking dogs over your daughter, but if rehoming one doesn't solve anything it doesn't entirely make sense to me to rehome the dog. Will your daughter have other issues with you? Can you work on your relationship at your husband's house and see how that goes? See if it really is just the dogs that are the problem. Also: will rehoming a dog still break your family because of your son's attachment issues?",

We have been living apart for a few months now, but we are trying to work things out and he and my daughter (12) are considering moving home to see how things go. \nThe problem is they are not happy with the dog situation. We have 2 Labradors, who are 1 yo litter mates and very bonded. Despite all the training I\u2019m trying to do they are wild and jump and get each other all excited constantly. If they are separate they are relatively calm but not when together. \nMy daughter in particular can\u2019t stand them. She and I are having problems as well, but now she and my husband are saying they will only consider coming home if we get rid of one. \nWe had severe problems with our last 2 rescue dogs, which both became aggressive, and had to rehome them. Our dogs now are not aggressive but just wild. I\u2019m doing all I can to train them better.\nBut right now it feels like I\u2019m being given an unfair ultimatum- choose a dog to get rid of or they don\u2019t come home. \nI feel like it\u2019s a terrible thing to do, my son (8) would be devastated, and I don\u2019t want my daughter to start thinking she can just get rid of a pet if she\u2019s not thrilled with them. (It was a fully agreed family decision to get them as well). She is not allergic or anything either. \nAm I the AH for saying it\u2019s absurd and cruel to get rid of one so they will try coming home? Besides that there is no guarantee they will even stay. It\u2019s also extremely unfair to my son. \nI feel like she should learn to be more accepting of situations she doesn\u2019t like- she could even help me train them if she thinks they\u2019re so horrible. \nWhy I might be the AH- am I in the wrong here and should prioritize her desires?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

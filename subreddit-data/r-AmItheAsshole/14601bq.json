A few years before the support ended I got a raise that was basically the same amount of money, so I started depositing the child support money in a separate savings account. \n\nAnd then I used it to take a vacation, because it just meant I was using all of my own money on kid expenses. (Which includes family vacations and his first car, before anyone gets mad.)\n\nChild support and SSI are not supposed to be a windfall earmarked for the kid, they are literally to assist with the expenses incurred in caring for them. \n\nIf a parent wants to set the money aside for the kids because they don't need the extra income, that's fine, but it's no different than any parent saving any portion of their own income for their children.",

In his case, this was a strategic decision because he could get that extra year of benefits.\n\nWe discussed this because I was receiving benefits as well but from a younger age. Mine ended at my 18th birthday or high school graduation, whichever came first. Fortunately these were the same month.\n\nI didn't get spending money, but the benefits came in really useful when I had to leave home and stay with local families for the last year and a half of high school. Through the help of local teen support services, it was arranged so that the family I was staying with received the benefits instead of my father. It helped offset the costs of taking me in.",

Those social security cheques exist for a very specific purpose: to replace the income your father would have brought in and used for your care, as your parent. That's why they were sent to your mum while you were underage, because they were meant for her to use to provide life essentials for you - food, shelter, etc.\n\nNow that you're 18, yes, the money goes directly to you. But that's only because as a legal adult it is assumed that you will be paying your own bills and need the money to help take care of yourself. If your mother is still de facto \"taking care of you\" - if you are living in her home, not paying rent, and she is providing your food, paying the bills, etc. - then the entire amount of the cheque should still be given to her. The fact that she's willing to compromise shows that she's thoughtful and how much she loves you. \n\nRight now, you want to keep all the money meant to be used to pay your bills, and still have her pay for all of those things. Your selfishness is shocking. You have a lot of growing up to do. YTA.",

This type of benefit is explicitly supposed to go to guardians for supporting minors while they complete their education/disabled adults who still live at home and cannot provide for themselves.

Keep the money, but she's not obligated to house you after 18.  She can start charging you rent.  You should contribute in some way.  It's only fair to her.\n\nShe is losing an income that she counts on to support you.  She'll get by better if you contribute a small amount or buy your own food and clothing.  She'll get by better if she doesn't still have to support you.  She it's not obligated and you should be thankful she's allowing you to stay.  \n\nI love my kids, but at 18 if they're not off to college, they're paying rent and contributing to chores or they're not staying.  I'm not raising freeloaders.  They need to learn to be responsible for themselves.  With only one parent, that's even worse.  If you can't stand on your own two feet, what happens to you if something happens to her?\n\nI get it.  You're young and don't fully see the whole picture.  You are correct that is your money, but your mother needs your contribution after 18.  There's no way around it.  You're taking money from her that covers food and bills.  That money was technically yours, but in the same fashion that child support is a child's.  If it goes towards bringing you up, it's used appropriately.  \n\nYou said:\n\n&gt;I can admit we\u2019re not the richest family but we\u2019ll survive without it, it won\u2019t make that much of an impact or change anyways. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being selfish, but I am starting to feel bad about it.\n\nYou ARE actually being selfish here.  \n\nShe lost your father, too.  That's a second income and the costs that those payments covered. She also has more expenses as a single mom because she usually has to pay for childcare if she needs to go literally anywhere or do anything that she can't take you to.  Work, doctor appointments, any other matters she needed to attend to, etc. Not just social outings, but those usually get pushed aside anyway when you're struggling. She did that for years using that money.  You're taking that from her and she's not asking for much in return.  You act like she should have been giving that to you as an allowance.  It's not the same thing, so you can't compare it like it is.  It's probably the only reason you were able to get by. It's not something she stole from you.\n\nMy mother actually did steal from me.  My wealthy uncle sent checks every for our birthdays and Christmas.  She set up accounts and made deposits we weren't allowed to touch it and rarely got an actual gift although that's what it was for.  Then when my sister wanted to go to a fancy boarding school, my mom used all my sister's and my money to pay for it.  I went to public school.  That is an example of theft.  That's what is wrong with parents managing a child's money.  What happened to you isn't even close.",

If one of these two is not true, your mother is committing social security fraud. \n\nAssuming you are supposed to be receiving this money, you would be within your rights to keep it all, but you would still be the asshole because you are not willing to contribute to a household where you are causing expenses.

Charge you rent and your share of all the bills (light, gas, phone, etc). You can pay for your own food and clothing. That way, your mom can still keep her other children housed and fed while you'll face the harsh reality of adulting. You don't pay for anything now so you think it's a fortune but as soon as you graduate the money stops.

As a minor, it was your mom's job to make sure this happened, hence why the money was sent to her. Now that you are no longer a minor, you are in charge of your own support. *However,* that comes with financial obligations. If you move out, then that money obviously goes towards rent, food, bills, etc. But if you are living with your parents, they can decide to charge you \"rent\" to cover the expenses they are paying for you. You're not a minor anymore, so they are not obligated to cover those expenses for free. \n\nYou're seeing this as \"but it's my check!\" Your mom is seeing this as rent, but calling it by another name. \n\nThe fact that you think \"she's been taking my money for years\" tells me that you don't quite understand why she was given the money in the first place. \n\nIf you really do not want to surrender a set sum of your check, then sit down and talk to your mom about the expenses she is still paying for you, and shared expenses (such as utilities). You can put yourself in charge of buying your own food, hygiene supplies, paying part of utilities, a small fee for your room, etc. That way you control how much goes to her. But, honestly, you might find out that would be more costly than just giving her a lump sum every month.",

            "comment": "Use this to acquire valuable life skills. This is a good time for your mother to teach you about finances. You will need to know about budgeting now that you are no longer a child.\n\nAsk her to show you what the family expenses are and the best way to budget. Also ask what happens if any of these don't get paid/are paid late. Ask how to manage bills that might not be the same every payday, such as power bills being higher in winter. \n\nThese will include:\n- Rent or mortgage payments \n- Rates or house tax or whatever is the equivalent where you live.\n- Power (electricity, and anything similar such as firewood for heating)\n- Insurance \n- Internet\n- Car payments/insurance/maintenance/fuel\n- Food\n\nAdd all those things up. That's what your mother is paying every week or month before she can even buy clothes for your siblings, and certainly before anything like a lipstick or new underwear for herself.\n\nIt is also what you will need to pay when you leave home.\n\nYou don't say how many siblings you have. If there are four of you in the home (you, your mother, two siblings) then a quarter of the sum of those outgoings, PLUS whatever it costs to feed you is what you should be giving your mother. IF there is anything left from the check after you pay her for your keep - and I would not be surprised if the check does not even cover that - if there is anything left, that's yours. \n\nRemember other things that have to be paid for such as your phone. If your mother is currently paying for that either give her the money, or change your account to be in your own name and you pay for it.\n\nWelcome to the world of being an adult. It's mostly good, but it brings responsibilities. The main one being having to pay for yourself.",

It is a compensation for the loss of income that your dad would have been contributing to the household before his death. That is what she used it for. \n\nOnce 18 then you are legally an adult so all the money goes to you but at that also  means your mom is not legally obligated to provide the necessities above. Now most parents still do of course because we want our kids to succeed. \n\nBut be aware if she does not make enough money to support your food and utility use then you should be stepping up to contribute so bills can still be paid. If she is able to pay those bills without tte money then tou don\u2019t have to give it. But she is ok to ask for it as well since you are living there. She is also ok to ask you for rent to help out. \n\nNAH",

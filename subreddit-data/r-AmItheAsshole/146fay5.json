One of them has straight up told me that they are mine even though I did all of mine. I just agreed to do them to keep the peace. But due to the fact I do not want to do dishes after my 10 hour Night Shift, i told me other room that I\u2019ll need to push helping them back a day. I used the excuse that I have more work to do for school (which is true since I have stuff to do for my upcoming placement). However, since I said that no one has responded. \n\nI\u2019m normally terrible at reading situations, and my social awareness is horrendous. Though I am trying to work on it.

You sound like a young adult, you need to work on using your words; like, \"no, I can't drive you when I need to sleep for my shift work, \" or \"no, I'm not washing dishes I didn't make.\" YTA to yourself for being a pushover, and to your roommates for not communicating. They'd be the ah for taking advantage of you, except you never tell them when you feel taken advantage of.",

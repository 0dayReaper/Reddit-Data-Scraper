One of my friends is starting to plan her wedding and we were talking about how to keep my bright red wheelchair from clashing with the colors she was leaning towards. It was more of a joke than a real thing, if I can make it she wants me there no matter what my chair looks like. \n\nIt devolved into the most ridiculous ideas like covering it with dollar store flowers using a hot glue gun (a la 5 minute crafts) or raiding the local graveyards for any not super dead looking flowers to hide it. \n\nWhat won the discussion was her mother looking up from the book she was reading and suggested a shower curtain hung around me so no one would see me in the pictures. A rolling rack with eyeholes and surround by shower curtains in the wedding colors. \n\nT and I were giggling like maniacs after that. The whole planning conversation went utterly off the rails as we came up with crazier and crazier ways to hide the chair. It was awesome. \n\nShe decided I won\u2019t have a bouquet as a member of the wedding party. Instead, we\u2019ll cover the back part of my chair in white satin and drape a floral garland over the headrest and let it trail behind me and I\u2019ll have a corsage. I need both hands free, one to drive, one to hold my service dog. \n\nWhen friends love you, *they accommodate you* and *any illness or disabilities you may have.* \n\nI wear one of those sensors and if you want me to not wear it or cover it up? Screw that. \n\n\u2026now I can\u2019t wait to bring that up with my friend and see how crazy we get coming up with the most ridiculous ideas to cover it up.\n\nEdit: i can\u2019t spell for shit, sorry!",

She sounds massively ablelist and a crappy friend.\n\nETA: NTA",

Cap\u2019s only 4 months old and needs socialization so I tote him around with me whenever I can. The more people, places and things he sees *now* as a puppy will help him adapt as an adult. All different colors, shapes and sizes of people, different surfaces to walk on, different places to pee, different ways of transportation (bus, train, van, car, eventually subway or PATH in NYC\u2026) and different environments. He has mastered elevators and handles them like a champ. \n\nHe was born on a farm in VA and now he\u2019s in a commuter suburb of NYC. We did our first train ride and he fell asleep in my lap while wearing an adorable little rainbow flower crown. He\u2019s been to a food truck festival, a horse racing track, been all over town, has been in restaurants and was with me when I got a haircut. We\u2019re socializing the heck out of him. His last round of puppy shots is tomorrow and it\u2019ll take about a week for them to get up to speed with his immune system. Then we can start socializing with other animals, other dogs and be a polite member of society. Very, very important skills he needs as a future service dog! \n\nWe have him walking on a loose leash, no pulling. He sits, lies down and heels on command. He knows how to hand target, learned doggy zen (to get the cookie you must give up the cookie. Meaning if he stares at the cookie, no reward. When he looks away or makes eye contact with me, cookie reward!) and so, so much more. \n\nAt four months he\u2019s amazing. His next step is learning to pick things up for me, I don\u2019t expect it to be hard. Then we\u2019ll teach him Stupid Pet Tricks. Right now he\u2019s learning how to blow bubbles in his baby pool. It\u2019s adorable. \n\nBy the time the wedding rolls around, he might just be asked to be the ring bearer and he\u2019ll be amazing at it in his little festive floral collar and bow tie. The plan is to get a basket, decorate it, tie the rings into it and let him go down the aisle by himself before he joins me at my side. \n\nAs soon as he starts to pick things up for me and has it down as a behavior on cue we\u2019ll start teaching him to carry a basket. That\u2019s a great behavior that;s great for gathering donations at rescue events when working with animal rescue groups.",

Priceless, thank you internet stranger hahahaha\n\nAlso, NTA OP - your friend can pay to have your sensor photoshopped out for her wedding photo collection if it bothers her that much. That sensor is now part of your body, it's like asking someone who has too big boobs to get a reduction so she could fit in her bridesmaids dress..... I've also heard of people asking their bridesmaids to lose a few pounds so they don't stand out too much in the pictures, and for people who have the audacity to ask bs like this, I ask you: \n\nHow self centered do you have to be to hear yourself making these requests and not think it's unfair or unreasonable? Let people be, stop focusing on some obsessive redundant details and have fun at your wedding/party. Literally nobody cares about people's medical devices, no one thinks they're an incumbent on good party vibes.... Maybe one or two people will ask about it, not having seen one before, but how insecure do you have to be to think a curious question directed at someone who's not the bride or groom will take away from your thunder.",

And he's got a dexcom like hers.Yeah she can put it in her tummy for this 1 time but I find it irksome for the \"friend\" to ask her to cover-up. The g7 is smaller compared to other cgms and why should it even bother her looking at it? I don't understand the friend's thinking here. Has it always bothered her that she wears this?",

            "comment": "NTA.\n\nMy late friend had T1D. When she was first diagnosed, she was quite self-conscious about doing the things she needed to (pricking her finger, injecting with insulin, etc.) in public. She was worried people would stare at her. She felt she needed to go off and find a bathroom to do it in private, and of course that wasn't always going to be possible, or the bathroom might not be clean enough.\n\nIt was a diabetes educator at the hospital who finally convinced her: *do not hide*. Diabetes management is a routine fact of life for someone with T1D. You don't need to make a big song and dance about it and wave your needles and lancets under people's noses and shout \"Look what I'm doing!\", but *nor do you need to hide it*. It's nothing to be ashamed of. If people are uncomfortable, that's their problem. They can just look away.\n\nSo from that point onward, she began managing her diabetes while sitting at the lunch table with us. And honestly, most of the time, I barely even noticed. I only ever remembered she had T1D when she'd start to act a little oddly, e.g. not making sense, or getting upset over nothing. Then I'd say \"Have you checked your BGL?\", and she'd check it, and it would be a bit low, so we'd get some sugar into her.\n\nYour friend is being an AH. Your sensor is essential medical equipment, and it's no big deal. It won't spoil her fucking wedding photos. Honestly, this is on a par with not wanting someone in a wheelchair to take part in the photos. It's ableist and cruel and stupid. In your case, it's also dangerous. Being forced to wear a jacket or sweater on a hot day is a stupid idea which could endanger your health.\n\nTell your friend you will not be covering up your sensor, and if she doesn't like it, she can get someone else to be her MoH.\n\nI'm betting she'll get the photographer to photoshop it out, which is still ableist, etc. but at least it won't involve you spending the day in a position of discomfort and risk.",

I was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and wear a small sensor on my arm to monitor my blood sugar (Dexcom G7). We were talking about the wedding one day and she brought up me wearing a small jacket or cardigan to cover the sensor, not wanting to see it in the pictures. It surprised me because if I stand at a certain angle you can\u2019t even see it. Since the wedding is during the summer and she wants it outside, I know it\u2019s going to be really hot and heat can already effect my blood sugar so I don\u2019t want too, but she\u2019s adamant that I wear one.\nSo AITA for refusing to wear a sweater at my friends wedding?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

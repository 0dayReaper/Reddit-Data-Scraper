    "postText": "I (16f) have a thest week coming up for school. My parents decided to visit some friends and i wanted to stay home to learn. They asked me if i stayed home if i could watch the dogs. I was honest with them and told them that I would walk the dogs and give them their food but i wouldn\u2019t be downstairs with them the entire time because i wanted to learn for school. My mom completely lost it. She called me cruel for leaving the dogs alone and said i should be with them so they wouldn\u2019t feel lonely. I said that i would learn for 4-5 hours and then i would go downstairs to watch them. She said i was heartless and I wouldn\u2019t die if i skipped one day of learning. At this point i was pretty annoyed with her and I told her the dogs wouldn\u2019t die from being alone a few hours. I also told her that i would walk the dogs and give them their lunch so they wouldn\u2019t be neglected and even if I didn\u2019t do those things they still wouldn\u2019t die.\n\nLong story short:\nThey dropped the dogs at my grandmas house and i\u2019m f*cking grounded.\nWhen she told me this I said something along the lines of: \u2018mom are you fr? They are not some mentally ill human beings who need care 24/7 they\u2019re just dogs who mind their own business. They won\u2019t even miss me for a few hours. They will just take a nap.\u2019\n\nTo which she replied: \u2018you are so heartless. I can\u2019t believe you would say that about the dogs. You\u2019re literally neglecting the dogs, I don\u2019t think i can trust you if you don\u2019t work on your behavior young lady.\u2019\n\nI don\u2019t think I am wrong here and it\u2019s not like i don\u2019t want to watch them to go out with friends or something. I just genuinely wanted to learn for school because i need to pass. \n\nSo reddit AITA?",

He has arthrosis and he\u2019s pretty deaf and almost blind but other than that he is still happy and likes to go on walks and we have a special buggy so he can come with us without having to walk but if he so much as coughs my mom will take him to the vet. Don\u2019t get me wrong i really care for the dogs but i just don\u2019t like them the way she does.",

You could easily pop downstairs every 2 hours and say hi to the dogs,  get a glass of water, talk to the dogs for 2 minutes and go back to studying. \n\nYour digging in your heels on this one and the attitude of I will do the bare minimum to keep them alive is the issue.",

I can easily sit for a 3-4 hours straight then i grab a glass of water from the bathroom (this takes less 30 seconds) and get right back to studying for another two or three hours and then i call it a day. That is the method that works for me and it gets me good grades",

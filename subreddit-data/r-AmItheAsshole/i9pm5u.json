    "postText": "I was raised by parents who believed (religiously and just culturally) in rigid gender roles. Dad should work, mom should stay home with the kids. I\u2019m the only girl and have 3 brothers. \n\nBecause of their expectation I\u2019d stay home with kids, they never valued my education, educational achievements or emphasized things beyond domestic skills. I\u2019m the second youngest. By the time I was in high school, my two older brothers had gone to the college of their choice, with my parents fully covering tuition, books, an off campus apartment and other living expenses. They eventually did the same for my younger brother. I was told I wasn\u2019t allowed to apply for college.\n\nI did so in secret and got accepted with a partial scholarship. I didn\u2019t tell them I was moving out until a week before I left, with essentially nothing but what a few friends gave to me that their parents bought \u201cthem\u201d for college. I took engineering, and had to work, take on debt and struggle.\n\nMy parents and I have barely spoken for years. I\u2019m married now and expecting our first child, and they asked to meet up. We met at a park, and they said they were \u201csorry if they caused me pain\u201d but would like a relationship now. I asked them specifically what they were sorry for. They wouldn\u2019t elaborate and just said they wanted to move forward. I said that wasn\u2019t sufficient. In the end, I said they could prove they were sorry by forwarding me the $100k my degree and college expenses were, just like they did for my brothers. My mom burst into tears, my dad said I wasn\u2019t being serious and I just left. Since then, I\u2019ve been getting calls from my brothers telling me I\u2019m being immature and hurtful. I don\u2019t think so at all.",

It was very fair, and if they have fixed their appalling bigotry issues, they would be falling all over themselves begging you to take the money. Since they clearly have not fixed their bigotry, you don't want them around your child.\n\nNever, ever poison children by allowing bigots in their presence. No exceptions. That includes your bigoted brothers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited to add: I have a bachelor's, master's, and doctorate all in engineering. You have no idea how angry this makes them. Hopefully you will too and we can all watch the bigots faint from sheer rage together. Bwahahahaha.",

Guy was nervous and didnt know he would get it but in the end did (obviously). Than we see how, yes, he works hard, but allt of it is really him already having a name out there because of his dad. Lots of older men at parties kissing up to him, pawing off his work to those below them and such. \n\nAnd at the end we see him grab a snack from a passing server as he talks about how poor people are only poor because they dont work as hard as \"we\" do....and the server he grabbed the snack from was the person we saw grow in poverty. \n\nI'm not trying to diminish his struggle. I'm sure he had to go through his own things, but dismissive language like that is harmful and ignorant.",

This will almost certainly never happen, though. \n\nAlso, tell your brothers to butt off. They got a huge advantage in life that you didn't get.\n\nNTA",

I\u2019m assuming they started saving for their sons\u2019 college tuition when the sons were first born; if they had genuinely had a change of heart and wanted to make it up to her, but hadn\u2019t had the chance to save up for it, that\u2019s when I\u2019d suggest being flexible with terms. But they\u2019re light years away from reaching that point, so... no. \n\n(Admittedly this is theorizing about a hypothetical situation rather than the actual one, so essentially pointless, but I just got stuck on that thought.)",

I found this thread on \"atonement\" and while discussing Jewish philosophy, I found a lot of it to be universal:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TheRaDR/status/1292803786990379008\n\n(tl;dr The steps for righting a wrong: Confess, learn, make amends, apologize)\n\nYour parents are asking forgiveness without recognizing they are wrong, understanding the depths of the damage their wrong has caused, attempting to compensate or repair the damage, and offering a half-hearted apology.\n\nThis is not how an adult handles things.  They are acting like children, thinking, \"Oh, if we just apologize for 'how you feel' we can see our grandchild!\"  This is bullshit.\n\nImagine the toxicity if your child adopted the same views as your parents?  As a girl, that she is \"less than\", or worse, a boy and he is \"more than\".",

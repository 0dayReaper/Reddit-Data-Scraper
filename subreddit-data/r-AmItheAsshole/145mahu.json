    "postText": "My wife (F29) and three of her friends (F31, F30, F27) were invited to attend a bachelorette party by another friend in the city where my sister lives. After spending a good amount on plane tickets and not wanting to spend more on a hotel or Airbnb, I (M30) thought it would be a good idea if my wife and her friends crash at my sister's (F25) place for the few days they would be staying.\n\nMy sister is training to be a pharmacist, and with financial help from our parents, she is able to rent an apartment. I told my wife my plan, and she agreed with it. I then called my sister and let her know about our plan, and after some persuasion, she agreed. Things went smoothly, and my wife and her friends had a great time.\n\nThe trouble started the day after they left. My parents paid my sister a visit the day after my wife and her friends had left and noted that her house was a mess. Apparently, dishes had piled up, and napkins were thrown around the house.\n\nMy dad called me angrily then and told me that the apartment was for my sister and not a hang out for my wife and her friends. In addition to making a mess, they also borrowed my sister's car for a day and according to him left the fuel tank basically empty.\n\nI told my wife about it, and she did admit to some dishes and using the car but confidently told me that neither was too bad. My wife was offended that my dad was nitpicking the situation, and to be honest, so was I.\n\nI called my sister and asked her what had happened. She did say that there was a mess (but nothing that she could not handle), and my parents only saw it because they had arrived only a day after my wife and her friends left. Seeing that my wife was still distressed about the situation, I asked my sister if she could apologize to her for the misunderstanding.\n\nMy sister agreed to apologize but was no longer willing to clean herself and insisted that I pay for a cleaner for her apartment and a tank of gas. I thought this was petty and told her not to try to shake me down for cash. She got flustered and then said she had to go. AITA?",

Those four people should make sure that they left the house nicer than they found it because that is what you do when you are a good guest. \n\nYour sister sounds very kind to consider taking in your wife and her friends. If anything, you should be disappointed with yourself for putting her in this situation and at your wife and her friends for being terrible guests. TBH, if we have to base our opinion of you on this situation alone, you sound like a terrible brother. Apologize to the sister. Pay for a cleaner and gas. Send her money for a spa day because she has to be stuck with you guys for family. I'm glad that she at least has your parents in her corner. YTA.",

She was not obliged to pick up after them, hand them over her car or shout them a full tank of gas. They were staying for free, and should have left the apartment immaculate. I\u2019m talking stripped their beds, cooked dinner, done all the dishes, taken out the trash, and brought your sister a bottle of wine for her hospitality. Clearly, none of that was done. \n\nYour dad was absolutely right. The apartment is your sisters, not a place for your wife and her friends to hang out.

It was a bachelorette party she wanted to go to and you wanted to cheap out on a hotel. Your sister did you a big favor by accommodating your wife AND her friends AND even let them use the car. You and your wife are both entitled and completely wrong.",

After spending a good amount on plane tickets and not wanting to spend more on a hotel or Airbnb, I (M30) thought it would be a good idea if my wife and her friends crash at my sister's (F25) place for the few days they would be staying.\n\nMy sister is training to be a pharmacist, and with financial help from our parents, she is able to rent an apartment. I told my wife my plan, and she agreed with it. I then called my sister and let her know about our plan, and after some persuasion, she agreed. Things went smoothly, and my wife and her friends had a great time.\n\nThe trouble started the day after they left. My parents paid my sister a visit the day after my wife and her friends had left and noted that her house was a mess. Apparently, dishes had piled up, and napkins were thrown around the house.\n\nMy dad called me angrily then and told me that the apartment was for my sister and not a hang out for my wife and her friends. In addition to making a mess, they also borrowed my sister's car for a day and according to him left the fuel tank basically empty.\n\nI told my wife about it, and she did admit to some dishes and using the car but confidently told me that neither was too bad. My wife was offended that my dad was nitpicking the situation, and to be honest, so was I.\n\nI called my sister and asked her what had happened. She did say that there was a mess (but nothing that she could not handle), and my parents only saw it because they had arrived only a day after my wife and her friends left. Seeing that my wife was still distressed about the situation, I asked my sister if she could apologize to her for the misunderstanding.\n\nMy sister agreed to apologize but was no longer willing to clean herself and insisted that I pay for a cleaner for her apartment and a tank of gas. I thought this was petty and told her not to try to shake me down for cash. She got flustered and then said she had to go. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Common courtesy says that you leave a place better than you found it. Especially when you are not paying!  And if someone is nice enough to let you borrow their car, you FILL the tank!  I don\u2019t care if you only used it to go around the block\u2014fill the tank!  Oh, and let me guess\u2014 they ate your sister\u2019s food and did not pitch in for that either, putting even more financial strain on your sister. Your wife and her three friends owe your sister a huge apology ( I find it absolutely astounding that not one of the four had any manners), as well as you.   So pony up the money for cleaning and don\u2019t complain. Your sister does not have the time to clean nor the money to have it done. Oh, and apologize to your parents as well.",

Your sister was minimizing the damage to keep the peace in your family and you decided to double down on the disrespect you and your wife had shown her by asking for an apology. You need to pay her for the gas and the cleaning. After that, get your wife into therapy to figure out why a 29 year old married woman would conduct herself in such a disrespectful manner in someone else\u2019s home.",

Who btw sounds lovely but seems like a total pushover but you know that already, don\u2019t you?! \n\nYou knew you could persuade your sister to let them stay there and that\u2019s why you have the gall to ask your sister to apologize, instead of asking your wife.

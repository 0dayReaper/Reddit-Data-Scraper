I think much of the problem with modern western society is that we have been raised off ideals that put men in position of power over women. While most things day to day are harmless, they contribute to the big subconscious acceptance of the patriarchy and gender roles.  I had an ex who called me his women. While at the time it didn't offend me, and I understand it came from a place of endearment, it is actually a possessive statement.  Similarly to women saying my old man.  I have a friend in his 60s. And he never even says my wife. He's says my spouse. Because spouse is a mutual term, and doesn't imply any ownership at all. I thought that was a pretty cool point of view,  and that's what makes me think this way.\n\nEDIT: My point isn't about the actual phrase but the \"deepness\" of the subject. The person I'm responding to said \"it's not that deep\". My point is that it is deep to some people. Some people really think about it .",

I've only ever seen someone use \"the wife\" when there's an invitation being extended and the invited party says \"let me check with the wife\" to imply they do not have the freedom to accept. It's like a subtle version of \"ball and chain\" where the onus on whether you can have fun or not is up to your wife. Kind of puts her in a position of being the nagging mom/secretary, y'know?\n\nOf course I don't think the vast majority of people (mainly men) who use this are doing so in a nasty way, but language matters. I've always used \"let me consult the calendar and confirm with &lt;partner&gt; that we don't have any plans.\" It places you on equal footing with each other as a team as opposed to your partner being \"the boss.\"\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying you leave all the mental load to your wife or are a bad partner for using this. Endearments get passed down and not seeing the bad in something like this clearly means you're not using it with bad intent. My point is more that I think it's valid to see \"the wife\" as a derogatory term that should be gracefully phased out as the base implication is not a kind one... even if it is used without malicious intent. I find this convo super fascinating as someone who loves linguistics lol.",

You keep them in mind in word choice all the time if English is your first language.

The way you use the phrase is in a way that is based on its connotations rather than its literal meaning.\n\nI would compare this conversation not so much to a \"the curtains are blue because symbolically\" English class conversation and more to a \"Hamlet saying 'get thee to a nunnery' could Colloquially be referring to a whorehouse\" conversation. Except unlike with Shakespeare, where the teacher has to teach about old connotations to the words Shakespeare was using, understanding modern connotations is a pretty intuitive thing to native speakers.",

Just because it's problematic on one level (societal), doesn't mean it *has* to be just as problematic on a personal, individual level. My SO likes it when I use possessive terms of endearment. But I don't actually see her as property or something to be owned, nor do I think it has anything to do with her role in our relationship, much less her role in society. People are unable to make this differentiation, so you get people like the woman in the OP story equating \"the wife\" with societal oppression of women and objectification. When that's just not what's happening. Too much nuance is being lost in how people are trying to police things like this.",

Where I live now (northern midwest), it is super common to say \"the husband/wife,\" and when someone uses their partners name, it is usually because they are upset about the situation. Ex: \" The wife has plans, so we're gonna head out early\" vs \"Sarah said we need to leave.\" The second one would be seen as more offensive/whiny/impolite than the first. But when I lived on the west coast, the term \"the wife/husband\" was absolutely seen as offensive, and people often referred to their partner by name only. (Here, it is almost always some kind of affectionate nickname used when referring to their partner.)",

Therefore insisting on using the specific terminology someone finds offensive is inherently AH-ish. The only exception would be if there is an important reason (either objective or personally significant) to use that particular vocabulary\n\nBut it's also AH-ish to correct someone else's word choice in a social situation unless they are repeatedly using it and/or it is objectively offensive.\n\nIn this case, her objection was not based on objective criteria since the term in question is a commonly used colloquialism, often used as a term of endearment. So the only way to have politely brought up her concerns would have been to claim it was a pet peeve or a quirk\n\nSo, ESH",

She didn't call you sexist, get over it.\nAnd YTA for not seeing the irony of your own \"hate when people get offended on behalf of others\" when it is exactly what you did x) Your friend was the one being \"corrected\", not you, not the other guys. Still you went on a 4 vs 1 argument for something concerning your very present friend. And really it wasn't about her getting offended for this woman but sharing how it's not a good way to talk about a woman in general. \n\nNow if you really want a basic explanation on why \"my\" is better than \"the\" (even though it's so basic I get why she called you fucks instead of participating to a debate full of irrelevant counterpoints) : \"the wife\" refers to the person focusing on their role while \"my wife\" focus on the bond they share. Thus \"the wife\" is impersonal and can easily be seen as degrading as someone having a function more then a connection.",

I told him that I would never ever stop him going out or doing anything, and if he didn't want to, he should just say so, but implying that I was controlling was a cop out. \n\nMaybe it's because we met and got married older, but we have our own minds and free will. Saying \"oh let me check with Mary if we have something on that weekend\" is different to \"I'll have to check with the wife\" which implies he needs my permission to be \"allowed\" to do something.",

But also The Wife isnt the worst vut there is a negative connotation to it so that would have been a learning opportunity for all of you instead of you jumping to defend yourselves",

It would have been so easy to just use \u201cmy wife\u201d or her name rather than dig in your heels on \u201cthe wife.\u201d \n\nIt makes me wonder if the person using \u201cthe wife\u201d really knows how she feels about it. Have they had an actual discussion or has she just never said anything?\n\nI do wonder why people say \u201cthe wife\u201d but not use \u201cthe (insert relationship)\u201d for other relationships. The only time I can think of people using \u201cthe\u201d instead of \u201cmy\u201d is referring to groups of people. The kids, the grandparents, the aunts and uncle. Nobody says the mom, the husband, or the friend.",

It was also acceptable to refer to her as your b$#tch..... But that was socially deemed inappropriate and dropped. Just because you still say it and she allegedly allows it... doesn't make it OK to the world at large. That's probably more to the point of what she was trying to convey to everyone at the table. And of course all the men dismissed her claims because you know better....than what a woman would feel like in a situation like this...\n\n\nI suggest an actual apology is in place. She was actively looking out for the well being of your wife.\n\nI'm also guessing this Convo involved multiple drinks. Cause it sounds almost like Stereotypical locker room chat among the men.",

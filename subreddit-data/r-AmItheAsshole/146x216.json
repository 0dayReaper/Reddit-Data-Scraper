I've started to notice he's become quite manipulative and doesn't respect my boundaries that I laid down when I was 13 he respected them up until the beginning of 2023. I don't eat breakfast because it makes me sick to my stomach and I end up throwing it up, everyone in my family knows this and it can last up to the next day (the sickness feeling) if I ate something big for breakfast.\n Today was no different, he woke me up yelling that I needed a shower and whether he dragged me in himself or got my grandma to do it I was going to shower. I don't shower everyday (it's a every other day type thing to make sure my skin doesn't crack or break out) last night I had showered at my \"friends\" dorm because I was spending time with him. I told my dad I had showered the night before but I just didn't get to wash my hair and I was going to do it tonight. He began yelling at the top of his lungs that he didn't care and that my hair was still greasy and I needed to shower NOW, I told my father I shower in the evenings so I get the dirt of the day off and go to bed clean. He was not having it and threatened to bring a pot full of water and get me out of bed into the shower. I just complied and showered because I didn't want an argument. I got out of the shower and into my room to dry off and my dad bardges in while I am completely naked telling me to get dressed and that \"we're\" going to breakfast, I honestly corrected him and said 'you, grandma and grandpa are going to breakfast'. I know my grandparents aren't going to be around forever but I have refused going to breakfast for so many years they should know I'm not going at this point. they (My grandparents) know I get sick and only ask me to get a peice of toast or something that they can spend their money on me which makes me feel really bad because I don't want them to spend money on something that I'm not going to be able to enjoy. I'm crying as I type this to be honest because I'm tired of my father's behavior and that I wish I could be a better daughter/granddaughter. I just need advice and I needed a place to see if I was really the A-hole in this situation.",

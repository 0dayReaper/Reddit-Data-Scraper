    "postText": "I've had this Samsung Galaxy A21s for roughly 2 and a half years now. It was a Christmas present from both of my parents after my old iPhone died. Ever since I got this phone, I've been missing using iPhones. For quite some time now, the phone has been REALLY slow and it's really peeing me off because of how slow it is. For the past month or so, I've been considering getting myself a brand new iPhone 14. My mum is against the idea of me getting one due to how costly it is. She said she would rather me buy a used iPhone that is an older model as they're cheaper. I don't want to purchase a secondhand phone, though. I want to buy one that is new. I'm 28 years of age, and she still sometimes feels the need to dictate how I live my life and how I spend my money. She even said \"you'll regret it big time\" if I did make the purchase. She wasn't even against my sister purchasing an iPhone, but she's against me purchasing one.\n\nWIBTA if I purchased it behind her back?",

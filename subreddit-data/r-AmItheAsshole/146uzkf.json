    "postText": "I, 17F, and my younger sister, 13F, recently got a puppy.  I work part time and my mom works full time so we have to juggle dog duty between us and my sister.  I work like 32 hours a week now that it\u2019s summer and I feel like I\u2019ve been being kind of taken advantage of.\n\nMy sister does not do anything all day.  When we are working she stays home with the puppy and \u201cwatches\u201d him by ensuring he is taken outside to go potty and that he doesn\u2019t do damage to furniture etc.. that\u2019s it.  Not a hard job at all.\n\nWhen I come home from a long day at work standing for 6-8hrs (I have joint issues and a chronic illness so it\u2019s harder for me than others) I would prefer to lay down and decompress.\n\nInstead, immediately upon entering the house, my sister acts like I am an \u2018angel\u2019 coming to relive her of her horrible task of dog duty for the dog she agreed to take on responsibility for and take care of.  Today I kind of snapped and told her that no, I am going to take a shower and lay down.  She proceeded to call my mom and have me basically chewed out for me having \u201cagreed\u201d to take the dog.  \n\nI took my shower anyways \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.  Afterwards, my mom called me and yelled at me again and said she would be home very late and that I\u2019d have to watch the dog til late and then kennel him\u2026 I asked why couldn\u2019t my sister do it because\u2026 you know.. she\u2019s NOT working early in the morning?  Nope, it\u2019s my job now since she already watched him during the day\u2026 for 6 hours.. the horror.  She got to stay upstairs where the dog isn\u2019t allowed and played games and laughed with her friends on the phone\u2026 loudly.. for hours.\n\nMy sister then decided it would be entertaining to come downstairs and try to start an argument with me (she does this ALL the time) regarding something about the puppy.  I just ignore her but she continues on her rant until she gets bored and goes back upstairs.  I told her she doesn\u2019t deserve the dog as she was going back up.\n\nBoth of them are mad at me and I\u2019m going to be exhausted tomorrow at work.  Idk how much longer I can keep doing this.  AITA??\n\nI also wanted to add that it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t watch the dog when I can, I frequently spend my free time and with him and enjoy doing so, I just feel like my sister views him as more of a chore than anything and it\u2019s not fair to me or the dog.  I don\u2019t mind watching him AT ALL, I would just like some time to myself and some rest after working long stressful days.  I come home from a 8hr shift and then get that compared to watching the dog sleep for 6 hours or less and have to watch the dog until it\u2019s time for bed, which is literally another 6 hours.  I have no time for myself.\n\nOn the days I don\u2019t work, I often spend the whole day with the dog and I don\u2019t get why my sister can\u2019t step up and give me a break, she\u2019s not even here most weekends when I do 8hr shifts.  I only work Tuesday Thursday Friday during the week.\n\n\nMore info: a lot of people think that she watches him every day for 6 hours but that was just today, she only watches him max 4 hrs while my mom runs errands.  Also- please take into account that I mentioned my chronic illness and I am extremely fatigued when I get home, I really need to decompress because my joints are always hurting really bad when I go home.",

You\u2019re learning what happens when you fail to do that planning, and now you need to figure out how to make it work. Maybe you need to find a new job or talk to your boss about cutting your hours. Maybe you need to just suck it up. But foisting your responsibilities onto your 13 year old sister is not the answer.",

You don't get to go to work and then claim your sister now has to do more. Also 13 is still very young. \n\nSounds like you're just trying to be the sibling that takes advantage of the other sibling because they are still young and have freedom.",

And disease does not discriminate - anyone at any age can have it. Rheumatoid Arthritis, what OP has, actually starts when people are really young. It\u2019s called JRA, JUNIOR RA. You really can\u2019t tell OP that just because she isn\u2019t over 50 years old and work full-time that it means she isn\u2019t sick. \n\nI\u2019ve had multiple AI (autoimmune illnesses - which RA is one of them) and I was diagnosed when I was 12 years old. I\u2019ve had liver problems, joint problems, heart problems, seizures, high blood pressure, and the list just keeps going. Just because I was very young doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t have it. I used to work 2 full-time jobs while doing my master\u2019s. Does that mean I\u2019m lying and I\u2019m not chronically ill? Eventually I had to stop working, but that didn\u2019t happen for about 4 years. It could be the same case as OP. I\u2019m just saying, don\u2019t tell someone whether or not they\u2019re chronically ill. That\u2019s just really messed up when over half the time chronically ill people are judged and called names because a lot of diseases are invisible and affect young people. For some reason, if you\u2019re below a certain age EVERYONE thinks you\u2019re lying and that it\u2019s impossible to be that sick when\u2026it isn\u2019t.\n\nOP should not have agreed to take care of the dog nor should she be working 32 hours a week if her joints can\u2019t handle it.

I work part time and my mom works full time so we have to juggle dog duty between us and my sister.  I work like 32 hours a week now that it\u2019s summer and I feel like I\u2019ve been being kind of taken advantage of.\n\nMy sister does not do anything all day.  When we are working she stays home with the puppy and \u201cwatches\u201d him by ensuring he is taken outside to go potty and that he doesn\u2019t do damage to furniture etc.. that\u2019s it.  Not a hard job at all.\n\nWhen I come home from a long day at work standing for 6-8hrs (I have joint issues and a chronic illness so it\u2019s harder for me than others) I would prefer to lay down and decompress.\n\nInstead, immediately upon entering the house, my sister acts like I am an \u2018angel\u2019 coming to relive her of her horrible task of dog duty for the dog she agreed to take on responsibility for and take care of.  Today I kind of snapped and told her that no, I am going to take a shower and lay down.  She proceeded to call my mom and have me basically chewed out for me having \u201cagreed\u201d to take the dog.  \n\nI took my shower anyways \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.  Afterwards, my mom called me and yelled at me again and said she would be home very late and that I\u2019d have to watch the dog til late and then kennel him\u2026 I asked why couldn\u2019t my sister do it because\u2026 you know.. she\u2019s NOT working early in the morning?  Nope, it\u2019s my job now since she already watched him during the day\u2026 for 6 hours.. the horror.  She got to stay upstairs where the dog isn\u2019t allowed and played games and laughed with her friends on the phone\u2026 loudly.. for hours.\n\nMy sister then decided it would be entertaining to come downstairs and try to start an argument with me (she does this ALL the time) regarding something about the puppy.  I just ignore her but she continues on her rant until she gets bored and goes back upstairs.  I told her she doesn\u2019t deserve the dog as she was going back up.\n\nBoth of them are mad at me and I\u2019m going to be exhausted tomorrow at work.  Idk how much longer I can keep doing this.  AITA??\n\nI also wanted to add that it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t watch the dog when I can, I frequently spend my free time and with him and enjoy doing so, I just feel like my sister views him as more of a chore than anything and it\u2019s not fair to me or the dog.  I don\u2019t mind watching him AT ALL, I would just like some time to myself and some rest after working long stressful days.  I come home from a 8hr shift and then get that compared to watching the dog sleep for 6 hours or less and have to watch the dog until it\u2019s time for bed, which is literally another 6 hours.  I have no time for myself.\n\nOn the days I don\u2019t work, I often spend the whole day with the dog and I don\u2019t get why my sister can\u2019t step up and give me a break, she\u2019s not even here most weekends when I do 8hr shifts.  I only work Tuesday Thursday Friday during the week.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "comment": "I\u2019m gonna address something that I don\u2019t think a lot of people understand or realize. Like you, I have multiple chronic illnesses - autoimmune diseases to be exact. This means that I am chronically fatigued and in pain. I actually had to stop working once I started having seizures and couldn\u2019t drive anymore. Anyways, what I\u2019m getting to is why are you working 32 hours a week if your joints are in that much pain?? Have you seen a rheumatologist or any doctor for that matter? You mentioned your joints which is why I asked about rheumatology specifically. If you have a medical condition then your job should be able to work around that and accommodate you. If work is what\u2019s causing these daily flare ups then you need to cut some hours. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m assuming this joint pain and fatigue isn\u2019t new, so why would you agree to get a dog with your sister and mom if you were already pushing yourself to your limit? It\u2019s important to know when too much is too much and it\u2019s important to create boundaries for yourself. Which you don\u2019t seem to have. Get this chronic illness under control, cut your hours at work, and help take care of the dog. If you have inflammation, go see your specialist and get started on treatment. You can also use compression socks, compression leggings, compression gloves to help with the inflammation. Hot baths also help relax your muscles. Biofreeze and Salompas are also really good and helpful. You can take ibuprofen, but it\u2019s not meant to be taken daily and in high dosages. Just, manage your illness. In a couple of years you\u2019re not going to be 17 anymore and you\u2019re going to have to learn how to really balance school (if you choose to go) and work and it\u2019s going to push you, so it\u2019s better to learn what your limitations are NOW.\n\nTrust me. I\u2019ve had Lupus, Fibro, and a bunch of other stuff since I was 12 years old. When I turned 24, things got really bad really fast. Obviously, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll happen to you. I have a friend with lupus who\u2019s been in remission for over a decade. Everyone\u2019s different, but with chronic illnesses, you have to learn how to manage them and not do things that are only going to hurt you. \n\nSeriously reconsider homing your dog. It doesn\u2019t sound like anyone wants to take care of him and he deserves better. And if your job and health prevent you from truly taking care of him, then he should be with a family that WILL. Not a family that sees him as a chore or who argue over who\u2019s going to care for him. \n\nTake care of yourself and if you\u2019re not going to rehome, take care of your dog!",

                    "comment": "I have severe rheumatoid arthritis in all of my major joints, I see a rheumatologist regularly.  I also have other gastro problems.  I have to give myself injections weekly to ensure I don\u2019t flare up.  My joints are just constantly in pain since they are already kinda wasted.  I\u2019ve had multiple surgeries to try and reverse the effects of my disease to no avail.  This comment means a LOT to me and it feels like someone really understands what I mean.  Thank you.  Unfortunately, I have no other choice but to work these hours because we are SEVERELY understaffed.  My mom never understands when I tell her I am in pain even though I was literally paralyzed from one of my flare ups.  I feel like I never get the relief I\u2019m looking for.\n\nEdit: We are not going to rehome him and even though this post is majorly complaining by me, he is very well taken care of and loved and he is 10 weeks old, very healthy, he\u2019s a rescue.  We\u2019ve successfully potty trained him, he knows sit, stay, come, down, spin, house (kennel), look, leave it, etc and he\u2019s still learning more.  Our vet approves of everything we\u2019re doing and we\u2019ve had dogs before",

                            "comment": "So, there\u2019s a subreddit for Rheumatoid Arthritis if you ever want to check it out. I have RA too as a result of Lupus, so I can say unequivocally that it is a nightmare. I actually developed Osteoporosis and have multiple fractures along my thoracic spine now - it was from years of being on prednisone. So if you ever take prednisone for a few months in a row, make sure you get a bone density test because it can cause Osteoporosis and before you know it you\u2019ll start fracturing things just from moving the wrong way in bed\u2026literally.\n\nI also feel you with the subcutaneous (I\u2019m assuming) injections. Mine were weekly as well until it caused drug-induced fibrosis of the liver. I have systemic lupus, so along with my joints, my organs are also involved. Now I\u2019m doing chemo again.\n\nHow long have you been doing the injections? I ask because if it\u2019s been over two months and you\u2019re not getting any relief from it then maybe it\u2019s time to either supplement your treatment or change it altogether. Your treatment won\u2019t take all of your pain away, but it should make it more bearable and it\u2019ll keep the RA in check so that you don\u2019t get worse. It really sounds like you need an appointment with your rheum. You might even decide to get a second opinion and change your rheum which is all too common. I think I went through five before finding one I trust.\n\nAnyways, I really think that you need to find a way to get your RA and gastro problems in check because the less it interferes with your life, the easier it\u2019ll be to do things like take care of your dog or go to work. For now though, you should try looking for another job. Something that isn\u2019t so exhausting or exerting. Seriously, you need to take care of yourself and even quit if you have to because it isn\u2019t worth destroying your body over or being forced to take a week off of work because you over did it. It will probably take a while to find the best regimen for you, but like I said, if these injections aren\u2019t doing it then you either need a supplemental treatment or something completely new. It\u2019s not normal to be in so much pain that after a 32 hour work week you\u2019re way too tired and in pain to take care of a dog. It is not normal. We\u2019re so conditioned to think that it\u2019s okay to live in pain and that this is normal for people like us, but that\u2019s not true. We were not meant to live in pain and we deserve and are entitled to living a somewhat pain-free life. I say somewhat because it will never completely leave.\n\nWell, that was way more than I was expecting to write, but it seems like you needed someone to tell you to take care of yourself. Don\u2019t be stubborn about it. And check out the chronic pain and RA subreddit sometime, if you haven\u2019t already.",

Did you all agree to getting it prior to doing so? Puppies are a huge responsibility. They cry at night and have to go outside. Sometimes it\u2019s like having an infant. That\u2019s why so many get dropped off along the road or at shelters. It really doesn\u2019t sound as if your family has the proper time to care and train for a puppy. I\u2019ve raised a couple of puppies in my life and I was never eager to hand them off and not have anything to do with them the rest of the night. Sounds like this situation would\u2019ve been better off with an already house trained, older dog. Many people would be, and under estimate puppy duty. Regardless, are you guys working with crate training? Puppies tend to like their crate. It can be difficult at first but she can crate the puppy when they need a break from each other. The puppy might be getting overly tired and a little crazy and overwhelming her if she\u2019s had not experience with them.",

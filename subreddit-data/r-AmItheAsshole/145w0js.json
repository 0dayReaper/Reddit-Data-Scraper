My 2 friends are both taller and weigh a bit more than me so when it came to pouring the drinks I had about half the amount if alcohol they did.\nWe each had 2 drinks\n\n(Side note, we had weak vodka abd mixers.

I'd consider myself a sensible drinker and know my limits, I'd say my tolerance is pretty high and I can have a buzz without getting drunk.\n\nSo after we were done and walking about they were shouting about how they need to \"ACT SOBER\" and how they need to practice their \"SOBER WALK\" \nthe reason they showed all this was because there was people our age nearby that we were walking by. I was so embarrassed and just wanted them to stop acting all hard and drunk and just chill with me.\n\nI personally think that they've proved they're not yet mature enough to drink and have a chill night without trying to scream to the whole world that their \"SO FUCKING DRUNKKKK\"\n\nAm I a bad person for being embarrassed of them and thinking all this?

I even had some petty revenge with one of them, switching her \u201cmimosa\u201d to just orange juice (didn\u2019t have enough alcohol for everyone) and watched as she pretended to be drunk for the next hour.  I realized it was some stupid tactic to appear cool to guys, and I stopped hanging out with them when they planned on drinking. Now that we are well into our 20s, we are still friends and they aren\u2019t so hard pressed to impress others, &amp; we actually can enjoy drinks together. Try to find other friends who are more fit to your drinking style in the mean time, your friends will sooner or later realize there is no reward to getting drunk just to try to make themselves seem \u201ccooler\u201d.",

I mean alcohol definitely can influence a human at any age to act like that but I\u2019d also say they\u2019re not mature enough to know when they should stop drinking. Especially if this is a reoccurring thing. You don\u2019t have to be their babysitter, you can just not go the next time they decide to drink. \n\nMaybe you could consider some sort of intervention because this is also not healthy behavior if they need to get plastered every time they drink. It could turn into a real problem and there\u2019s always a possibility to develop some sort of dependence (not saying it will happen but there\u2019s a chance with anything).",

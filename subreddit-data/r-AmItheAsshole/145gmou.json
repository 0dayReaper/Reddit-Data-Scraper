    "postText": "A bit of background.\n\nI(24M) and my brothers (20M,18M) lost our mother when I was 7. Three years later Dad married his wife. My brothers very quickly accepted her as a mom, but I couldn't. I had a mom and she was gone. When my brothers were 9 and 11 my stepmother wanted to adopt us. I was against it and so were my maternal grandparents. Unfortunately my brothers wanted this so they went through it. I felt so removed from anyone in the house. I was the only one with my mother's last name. \n\nMy grandparents (including uncle and aunt) were my only connection with my mother. I spend a lot of time with them. I had a lot of fights with my dad because I wanted to go to my grandparents when my family went anywhere for longer time, like vacations. My brothers did have some relationship with my grandparents but it was nowhere near what my grandparents had with me. I guess some distance was created after adoption.\n\nMy grandfather died in 2020 and my grandmother early this year. I'm still very much grieving both of them. Luckily, I still have my uncle and aunt.\n\nGrandmother had a will in which all her estate is divided three ways: me, uncle and aunt. My uncle is helping me with everything and warned me to not tell anyone about inheritance. Unfortunately I got court mail delivered to my house (I still live at dad's) and whole hell broke. \n\nDad demanded to know why I kept inheritance a secret and I told him it's nobody's business but mine. My brothers asked to share it with them and I told them that they don't belong to maternal family anymore and they will inherit after stepmother. They got upset and called me AH. I asked them when was the last time they visited our mom's grave, or even their grandparents, but they had no answer. I told them that this is why they are not entitled to anything. My dad got very angry and kicked me out and told me I can come back when I apologize and share inheritance. I'm currently with my uncle.\n\nMy brothers are constantly texting me how they are devastated. My uncle told me that this is emotional blackmail and I didn't to anything wrong. To just stand my ground. \n\nI'm conflicted. Am I AH?",

It sounds to me as if the maternal family weren't happy at how the two young children accepted their stepmum and 'replaced' the mum they probably could barely remember (if at all), particularly after the adoption. It's not clear whether the maternal family rejected them for accepting the stepmum or if they were influenced to reject the maternal family in favour of the stepmum - even then, if the grandparents withdrew after the adoption, when they were still basically kids who didn't have a more adult perspective on the layers of relationship dynamics, how are they meant to feel/act as young teenagers whose grandparents barely talk to them because they're upset they have a mother? It sounds like by the time they might be old and mature enough to see a wider picture, their maternal family had turned away from them already.",

We also don't know how stepmom reacted in the past whenever the children interacted with birth mom's family either. OP'S has had to fight for time with the grandparents from the sounds of it, so it's not hard to imagine that father and stepmother were trying to create that wedge and succeeded.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nA bit of background.\n\nI(24M) and my brothers (20M,18M) lost our mother when I was 7. Three years later Dad married his wife. My brothers very quickly accepted her as a mom, but I couldn't. I had a mom and she was gone. When my brothers were 9 and 11 my stepmother wanted to adopt us. I was against it and so were my maternal grandparents. Unfortunately my brothers wanted this so they went through it. I felt so removed from anyone in the house. I was the only one with my mother's last name. \n\nMy grandparents (including uncle and aunt) were my only connection with my mother. I spend a lot of time with them. I had a lot of fights with my dad because I wanted to go to my grandparents when my family went anywhere for longer time, like vacations. My brothers did have some relationship with my grandparents but it was nowhere near what my grandparents had with me. I guess some distance was created after adoption.\n\nMy grandfather died in 2020 and my grandmother early this year. I'm still very much grieving both of them. Luckily, I still have my uncle and aunt.\n\nGrandmother had a will in which all her estate is divided three ways: me, uncle and aunt. My uncle is helping me with everything and warned me to not tell anyone about inheritance. Unfortunately I got court mail delivered to my house (I still live at dad's) and whole hell broke. \n\nDad demanded to know why I kept inheritance a secret and I told him it's nobody's business but mine. My brothers asked to share it with them and I told them that they don't belong to maternal family anymore and they will inherit after stepmother. They got upset and called me AH. I asked them when was the last time they visited our mom's grave, or even their grandparents, but they had no answer. I told them that this is why they are not entitled to anything. My dad got very angry and kicked me out and told me I can come back when I apologize and share inheritance. I'm currently with my uncle.\n\nMy brothers are constantly texting me how they are devastated. My uncle told me that this is emotional blackmail and I didn't to anything wrong. To just stand my ground. \n\nI'm conflicted. Am I AH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

I always think when reading these kind of posts that it's sickening how some people demand so much in death when they gave so little in life. It's not even about the adoption - your brothers were so young. But it seems they took very little interest in their maternal family and in their birth mother, which must have been a real kick in the teeth for your grandparents who lost not only their daughter but also her children. All they care about is the money, not your grandma. Honestly it's vile.",

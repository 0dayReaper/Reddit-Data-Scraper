Once he is, y'all can renegotiate.\n\nI did want to gently mention your statement that you keep your office pretty messy. This is going to spill over into your living room under your current plan. So. Is there a way to have it less messy around your WFH desk? Not judging, just asking. Do you have a lot of physical paperwork or products to deal with? \n\nI WFH 100% and the only things on my desk at the moment are my computer, my water bottle, my mouse, and my headset (in fact, my headset is hanging off a hook on the side of my desk). Anything else gets put away/thrown away (as appropriate) as soon as I'm done with it. I used to be a messy bessy too, but I figured out that 3 minutes of maintenance a day kept things super-tidy, and it actually helps me focus and concentrate better, too. \n\nAgain, I mean this very gently, but a messy work area *can* = messy work/mind.

If you are both in the bedroom you're 1-1, he gets his own office and storage space for gaming and his stuff, youre 1-2 (he wins). HE should already be paying more just for having the office at all, by his \"reasoning.\"  \n\n\nIf you have to share the small room with him AND he gets the big office, he should pay 80% by his \"logic\".  \n\n\nYou need the office because you actually have a job AND wfh fulltime. He is not only unemployed but also didn't even wfh full time before.  \n\n\nWhat is this bullshit?  \n\n\nNTA except to yourself if you don't nip this selfishness in the bud. If he cant act normal about this it speaks to a future of you being second rate to his free time, his hobbies. Are you planning on having kids?

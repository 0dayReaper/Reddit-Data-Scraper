Even if he is, his reasons for wanting to know are none of your business and you should not have called him out like that.\n\nAdditionaly, I think it's perfectly fine, and quite smart, to be aware of what ppl are saying about you, and it's normal to be curious, especially after you just got told someone is gossiping about you.\n\nEdit: I want to add that it's good that you are looking out for your friend (if that's what you are doing), there are just better ways to go about it. If you think he is insecure, support him, encourage him, help him build up his confidence  things like that. Calling him out like this may make him MORE insecure.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI was having dinner with my flatmates; they are very close. I was good friends with one of them before moving in together, Laura. The other flatmate, Max, was also my friend, but we didn't know each other that much then. He is more quiet and social interaction is difficult for him sometimes. I rarely eat with them because we have slightly different schedules. \n\nMax was talking about a common friend of us who is very much into gossip. He gossips about everyone, Max was saying, so I wonder if he gossips about me. Of course, Laura said with no doubt. I wonder who he gossips with about me and what he says about me, Max said. Why? I asked, because I really didn't get the point. Because I think it's interesting, he complains about everyone and I want to know what he complains about me, Max answered. This is pretty fair, because there is very little you would have to complain about Max, but I was quite thrown off by the way he put it, and I said: I don't want to be the asshole but (yeah starts bad) the way you say this sounds like you are speaking out of your insecurities. Then he said no no I just think it is interesting, I said okay okay sorry, and then it was uncomfortable.\n\nOf course, this conversation is paraphrased and shortened, but I tried to keep the sentences as close to a quote as possible.\n\nSo AITA for my comment? I do actually worry that he might be reinforcing the insecurity by putting this as something desirable. I guess it was not the best way to handle it on my side, but I think it is important to bring it up when a friend is entering some thinking pattern that might be bad for themselves. What would you guys have done?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

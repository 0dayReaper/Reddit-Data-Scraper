    "postText": "Rachel and I work together in a neighbouring city. Last year around this time I found out I was pregnant. It was unplanned. Prior to this I was renting a place, which was pretty close to this friend's apartment. We were besties. But everything came to a haul. I got married, moved to my natal town and honestly, now, with the baby here, I'm the happiest I've been in a long time.\n\nWhen I found out I had this great plan of having her as my child's godmother alongside Mary, an older friend of my husband.\n\nTime passed and I slowly started reconsidering it because:\n\n1. I went a few times back my work town and was excited to see her. She was 90% flaky and didn't show up (she drives  I don't)\n\n2. DH and I went to a our (R and I) friend's wedding and needed a place to stay. We had to go to a hotel because she wasn't that comfortable with it. Sidenote: She often used to say that she would be there for me day and night because we're besties.\n\n3.  When we came back from the wedding, we carpooled with another coworker. She wanted to drive all of us home. R said to drop us all at her place because she'll take us to our hotel. Once there, R reconsidered because she drank a little and we had to wait half an hour in the cold for an uber. \n\n4. She didn't visit by herself once. Only when our common friend (the one thay got married) drove. Her excuse: gas is expensive. \n\n5. She called when I was around the end of my 3rd trim asking me what she needs to do/buy for the baby and to keep in mind that she's a bit low on money, but she'll do her best. \nSidenote: she brags that she makes a very good amount of cash through some independent work. I can confirm since before the pregnancy I used to do similarly.\n\nMary, however, bought almost everything in the nursery as a surprise gift. Then, I also found out that M asked us to make her daughter the \"official\" godmother because they would be closer in age (M is around 50, her D 20). So, I decided to make M and her daughter the only godmothers. 3 is too many in our religion.\n\nNow, R's flakiness and other stuff wouldn't bother me. Despite everything, I love talking to her, we share so much and we are nonstop laughing when together. But I don't want someone unreliable for my kid. \n\nBecause I want R to be a part of my family, I asked her if she'd like to be the midwife instead. She said no and that it feels like a demotion.\n\nGranted, I never clearly presented everything that bothered me about what she did to make me change my mind. Mostly because I'm scared of conflict so I do my best to avoid instigating one. Also because I don't want to lose her as a friend. \n\nNow, R said she felt humiliated about the whole thing. Especially at work, where she has to tell different lies to other work friends to which she already bragged that she will be the godmother. I tried to message her and explain the above reasons and so forth, but the other friend called me before sending it and told me to stop and just say that I'll do better if I want to keep this frienship.",

Dont give her the , its complicated, answer either, just give all the positives that the other 2 bring to the table.  If she pushes the subject you may have to give her the \"head tilt, chin down\" look that says SERIOUSLY?",

            "comment": "YTA for demoting your friend and replacing her without beginning an attempt to discuss what you expect from your friend as a godparent. The reasons for the demotion seem frivolous in comparison to the effort you have invested to maintain the commitment by communicating expectations, and for this reason I do not find it credible when you say 3 godparents is too many in your religion.",

                    "comment": "Honestly I would say NTA. For the most part a godparent is either two things. One being the person you\u2019ve in-trusted your child to in case anything happens to you. Or two the person who\u2019s responsible for their religious journey. Either versions carry a lot of responsibility. If you\u2019re choosing based on option 1 then you\u2019re gonna go for someone who\u2019s value system/thought process is similar to yours (usually). If you\u2019re going for option 2 then you\u2019re gonna go for someone who matches your religious based values. Chances are OP is going with option 1 and let\u2019s be honest, choosing the person who\u2019s more invested in you and your family to be the one to look after your child is valid.",

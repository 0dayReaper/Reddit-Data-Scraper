I wished I'd done it before. They don't always back down through, so caution may be needed. \n\nThink strategically through worse case and medium bad case events that can come out of you doing your party (which you should), and plan for those. Ask your mum 'why are you letting that bully disrespect and control you and me too? You have the power to make your own choices and you pay half. Don't be his doormat'. Do they own the house together? Eg if he tries to kick you out, your mum can say no.  \n\nOften things cool down after the initial heat, if only you can endure the time out. Can you leave early that day and stay with friends for a night or 2? \n\nIf he pushes ahead to kick you out, at least say you need some weeks to find a place then see if he cools down. Then lobby your mum to tell him to stand down. Don't accept your mum repeating his demands (my mum now denies doing that). Your mum is enabling him by allowing him to domineer (unless he's dangerously violent, but you haven't mentioned that.) Violent stepdad just seemed to teenage me like a spoilt baby having a big tantrum. How do you manage a baby? Your mum could ignore him and make her own rules \n\nBuild your own successful life. Make sure your partners and frienda always treat you with respect, as we.tend to repeat the same dynamics",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nThrowaway account long time lurker first time poster! \n\nSo I (20f) am turning 21 at the end of the month (June). I didn\u2019t decide what I wanted to do for my birthday because I knew the following situation would happen, so I told my mum that I would tell her once I decided and to not sort anything.\n\nToday, my mum texted me saying she\u2019s organised the party for me and she started inviting a bunch of people - without asking me who I wanted to come. These people include my step-dad\u2019s family and his friends, who I am not close to at all. Haven\u2019t actually seen some of them since my mum and step-dads wedding 4 years ago. They aren\u2019t my friends or family, they are his. Only invited because of him. \n\nPretty much, my step-dad is always picky about parties at our house and how many people come to our house, even though my mum and him split the costs of everything 50/50. He somehow feels like he owns more of it than her and can dictate what goes. Idk he\u2019s get misogynistic and hasn\u2019t cooked a day in his life. But I digress! Basically he feels that he should dictate who comes and goes and how many can come and if people he likes aren\u2019t there then the party won\u2019t happen. I haven\u2019t had a birthday party since I was 18 because of this. But I\u2019m 21 so it\u2019s a \u201cbig one\u201d.\n\nI told my mum \u201cI don\u2019t want xyz\u201d there and listed a few people off the list of step-dad\u2019s family and friends (some of them I do like). She asked me \u201cwhy,\u201d I said \u201cbecause if there is a limit, I\u2019d rather have my friends there than distant family members and people who aren\u2019t my friends.\u201d\n\nShe told me that I could just do something with my friends another day and to invite them to \u201ckeep everyone happy\u201d but I told her my friends are busy and have kept my birthday weekend open specifically in case I did do something. We all have jobs/uni/etc. and haven\u2019t met up since new years as a group so my birthday is a way for us to meet (first birthday of the year for us). she said i can\u2019t invite them because of how many she has already invited.\n\nI said I\u2019d rather cancel the party she organised and just go out with my friends than have one at home filled with randoms just to make my stepdad happy. She called me selfish because i didn\u2019t want to celebrate with family and told me to grow up. My step-dad overheard and said \u201cit\u2019s not your house so you don\u2019t get a say in it\u201d and i just said \u201ci\u2019m sorry\u201d and walked off to my room to avoid another argument with him.\n\nI may be TA for not sucking it up and trying to reorganise with friends.\n\nAITA for saying that? WITBTA if I cancelled it?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your mom and sdad think this way, and you're seeing past this BS. You can keep a cordial relationship with them, show up to their party for an hour or two. I assume you need to keep living with them for financial reasons?\n\n2. Have a conversation with your mom to communicate how you're feeling. Try to hear her side of things but be firm and clear, e.g., \"mom, thank you for raising and taking care of me and I love you. But your actions are making me feel like you care more about throwing a party for your friends rn than you do about me\" \n\n3. Ghost but leave a note \"I let you know that I did not want this party. I would like to improve our communication because I don't think we wind up hearing each other and I would like to have a relationship with you\"",

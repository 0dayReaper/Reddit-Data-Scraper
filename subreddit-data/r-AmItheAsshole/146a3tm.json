It would have been like if he were in a same sex relationship and went up to his boyfriends parents like \"hi I'm your son's bf, he's gay and he doesn't follow your religion anymore\" it could have cost her her family at best, and if her family were severely abusive, her life.\n\nOP needs to learn when to butt out, keep his mouth shut and stay in his lane.",

Heck, it was a bit of a stumbling block for my friends\u2019 parents to accept her sister\u2019s engagement because it was a love match that they found themselves.\n\nAnd OP not being Muslim would most likely also be a problem. My friend explained that Muslim men can marry non Muslim women because their culture is patrilineal. But for the same reason Muslim women cannot marry non Muslim men.\n\nAgain I know there is more than one form  of Islam and  there will be cultural impacts as well. Plus every family is different. But judging from the fact that the mother didn\u2019t even know of this boyfriend\u2019s existence, it was an issue in this family.",

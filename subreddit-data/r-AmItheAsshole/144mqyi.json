    "postText": "My (20f)\u2019s sister (Jane-28f), her daughter (9 month old-Lucy) and our mum (Sarah-50f) all came to visit me a few days ago. One of my housemates has a dog and during warmer days, we make frozen banana and peanut butter oat balls for the dog to have as a treat. They are entirely edible for humans. It\u2019s literally a banana, a scoop of peanut butter and a cup of oats. That\u2019s it. \n\nAnyways, Lucy was fussing and Jane tells me that she\u2019s in the teething process and asked if I could freeze some of the baby food for when she needed to eat in an hour or so. I agreed and asked if she wanted to give Lucy a frozen peanut butter oat ball. Jane agreed and Lucy loved it. \r\n\nAbout 2 hours into the visit, my housemates gets back with her dog and goes into the freezer to get one of the frozen treats and my sister gets all antsy. Mum and I ask what\u2019s wrong and she asks if I made the treats for Lucy. I said no, they\u2019re technically for the dog, but It\u2019s safe for human consumption. \r\n\nJane freaks out and picks Lucy up and goes to the car. She\u2019s crying about how I gave her daughter \u2018dog food\u2019 and how I should have disclosed that it was made for a dog, but I didn\u2019t think it mattered. It didn\u2019t have dog-only ingredients or anything. \r\n\nI tried to talk to Jane but she won\u2019t respond and is genuinely insisting that I fed her daughter dog food. Our mum is split; she thinks Jane is being ridiculous and says she\u2019s only on her side \u2018publicly\u2019 because she\u2019s a new mother.\r\n\nAITA?\r",

This is people food that I use to treat my dog. It is not dog food. I would not feed dog food to a child. That's the last I'm hearing about this because it's too simple not to understand. Anybody else falsely accuses me of feeding dog food to a child is gonna have a different problem with me and they're gonna have to explain why they are making up vicious lies and slandering my character.",

    "postText": "So, I'm a freshman at university and I live alone pretty far away from my hometown (think other side of the country). Today, while going home, I found the tiniest kitten on the sidewalk with no mom cat or other kittens around and no one knew where it came from. It was shaking from all the loud noises and I felt really bad just leaving it there, especially running the risk of it being ran over. \n\nSo, I grabbed it and brought it to the vet to get checked out. It needed milk, and some medicine for its eyes. All in all, the vet took 40\u20ac from me, and it was an impulse decision to pay it because what else was I going to do? Dump the kitten in the vet clinic and run off? \n\nI took the kitten home and put it in a box as I searched for someone to take care of it. I would keep it but it requires constant attention and expenses, which I can't give because it's exam season, I'm a broke uni student and I'm expecting my adopted dog to come within the next weeks. It simply wasn't an option. \n\nSo, in my blind panic on what to do, I called my mom, who lives halfway across the country. The second I told her I found a kitten, a flip switched and she went off, yelling at me about being so irresponsible.

You should be legally an adult if you attend uni, so she cannot pull you from anywhere against your will.\n\nIf it's a money issue, I would check out government programs for uni students. Some EU countries like Germany have student loan programs to help with living expenses etc.\n\nYou did a good thing and helped an animal in need. Don't let her destroy the good in you by making you feel bad for a good deed. Stand up for yourself.",

I wouldn't feel guilty about lying, and one day, when you're done with universities, I would let her know how horrible and heartless and controlling her behavior is. As a mom, I would be exasperated, but I would never insult my kid or threaten them like this. If your skin is a true issue, you should rehome the kitty, tho. To avoid more bills hun. Also, when you have the time, you should see a dermatologist if that skin rash comes back.",

It made me feel a little better :)\n\nThe kitten was given to an animal shelter to be hopefully adopted soon so he's all safe and sound now. No sign of rash yet, but if one comes up, I know what to use this time thanks to the last time this happened.\n\nIt's nice to hear other moms wouldn't think this is normal, it makes me feel a little bit less guilty about making her mad",

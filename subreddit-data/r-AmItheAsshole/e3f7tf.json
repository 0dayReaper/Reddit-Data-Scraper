You need to find out why A has such a strong dislike of her and reacted so strongly.\n\nA is probably still deep in mourning for her mother. You've managed to put your grief behind you, but the process is much slower for some people. Seeing C in her mother's place at Thanksgiving was probably very hard on your daughter. That doesn't excuse her rudeness, but it might explain it. \n\nSecondly, you've made your daughter's tuition dependant on C accepting her apology. As the fees are something between you and your daughter that's not appropriate especially as C seems to be the issue here.\n\nEdit: when I say 'C is the issue' I mean the relationship C and A have, not C herself.",

My dad and stepmom also encouraged me to talk with them about my feelings but I didnt want to share my feelings with a woman I had basically just met, and then I was punished later for it in much the way you are expressing (saying that daughter HAD the chance to share her true feelings but didnt.) I have been the daughter whose father chooses a new woman and suddenly I'm a brat for being scared and unhappy and not very nice. I have had my dad make my relationship with him contingent on my relationship with a woman I barely knew. It sure didnt teach me a lesson. It just made me feel really alone, sad and resentful.\n\nFrankly, if you expect to bring a new woman into your life so sook after your wife's passing and have it go totally hunky dory with your daughters, you're not thinking realistically and placing unfair expectations on your daughters. Though obviously speaking so rudely is over the line, your daughter actually has every right to be having a hard time with this.\n\nAlso please recognize that while it's so wonderful you've learned to love again and you want to share this goodness with your children, your daughters do not have the option to find a new mom. They will never meet some wonderful woman to fill that empty hole for them and build anew. \n\nOP, your daughter needs you to be there for her. You may not feel like you can help her. Maybe your wife was the one who used to know how to do these things, have these talks. You may not feel like your daughter needs you but she does. Punishing her like this is only going to drive her away from you. Please just talk to her.",

I know what she said and did was way over the line, but as this commenter said: she\u2019s grieving and probably feels like she\u2019s losing her other parent, too. I feel like threatening her entire future is the wrong approach. It kind of makes me understand the daughter\u2019s reaction. It seems like this may be how the family interacts.  Not with compassion or understanding, but with being mean. That goes for both the daughter and the father. But I don\u2019t know the entirety of their relationship. I agree and hope OP sees that comment.",

Imagine the feeling she would be going through leaving for college, everything being more or less how it was when mom was alive, and coming back to this.\n\nNew woman, probably new pictures on the wall of their dates, some of her stuff in the house, *she's sitting in mom's chair*. I imagine her thought process upon seeing it all went something like this\n\n\"How fucking dare he, shes your wife, I loved her and I'm still torn up about this, how could you just... *replace* her?\"\n\nHer excuse of she \"just doesn't (like her)\" is pretty telling too. It's possible she just doesnt understand her feelings right now, either because shes young or shes in a swirling vortex of emotions and can't grasp at anything solid other than hurt, anger, and negativity. It's also possible she knows exactly why she doesnt like her and isnt saying anything because she doesnt think theres any point in trying to explain it to OP.\n\nI hope OP reads these comments and understands shes still coming to terms with her mom's death. You want to punish her for lashing out, sure, fine, don't fuck up her education. The way the world is going that could set her up for failure and coercing a false apology out of her won't help anyone.\n\nGrief counciling and/or family counseling are definitely cards you should consider. And limit interaction between your daughter and new GF, it's not her fault she feels that way, and seeing you two together is just rubbing salt in a still open wound.",

Last year my mom passed early in the year and my dad quickly remarried (5 months after my mom passed). I was away at college and not told until after it happened and was still expected to be at Thanksgiving that year. I could bring myself to enter that house, especially to that new woman, so I didn't go. He called me that night and threatened to disown me, and while he never did there is a trust and bond that broke and will never be there again. This needs to be a time for talking not threats.",

She was clearly out of line and horribly disrespectful to her father's partner her father. \n\nIt's the relationship between her actions and the punishment that people are discussing as well as pointing out her actions aren't exactly rational.  Following though with removing tuition is dropping a nuclear bomb on OPs relationship with his daughter.  If he thinks that's appropriate then that's his choice, but I think it's far too harsh for what is essentially a young adult acting like a petulant child.  There must being something between no tuition and no punishment that would be more appropriate.",

Keep fights limited to what's actually going on. Don't threaten to blow up the foundations of your relationship unless you get your way (or you actually are ready to end the relationship over it)",

It may not excuse her actions, but at the very least, don't punish her for her grief. \n\nI've been in a similar situation. Though it happened to me at a much later age. I have lashed out, and I still despise the new woman. Because the speed at which the new woman came into his life made me question everything up to that point. Was the marriage ever real? \n\nIn the case of your daughter she has the added grief she needs to process. And in her eyes she might feel she hasn't had the time to. While she's still grieving you've brought this new person back and forced her to accept (again) the reality that her mom is truly dead, and that you've already moved on. \n\nCertainly you withholding paying her tuition on condition of her apology, makes you also an asshole. She hasn't had any time at all to even build up her own savings to pay her own way, and you drop her the moment you can because she offended your new GF. That would just build up resentment, and further her inner convictions that now that you've moved on, you have chosen this new woman over her, your daughter. \n\nFrankly speaking, there are many other better ways you could have handled this. Sitting her down and asking her how she's feeling for one. Understand and give her the space she needs, and she will come back from this.",

Granted, I didn\u2019t call her a fat pig, but I did call her a racist when she said racist shit at the dinner table.

He was doing something nice for her (helping with college costs). He took back that nice thing.\n\nThe daughter isn't entitled to that assistance. That assistance isn't *her* future. Let me ask you this. If you were helping your friend with rent after a nasty breakup, and that friend then told you that you were a pathetic loser, would you be an asshole for telling your friend he needs to start taking care of himself, because you won't help someone who disrespects you?\n\nSpeaking as A did was highly disrespectful, both to C and to OP. I feel that where OP went wrong is using the tuition as a bargaining chip to force compliance, rather than talking. A better tool would have been 'you are not welcome in my home until you can respect everyone within it'.\n\nBut I don't see this as him taking away her future. I also don't see this as something that can be easily talked about and fixed. This seems to be a more complex issue than what reddit can really get.",

He is the selfish one by forcing his kids to accept his new girlfriend after such a short amount of time. Nobody says he can't have a girlfriend but he could wait to introduce her and include her in family holidays like thanksgiving. Instead of warning his daughter to better behave around her. Try to see this from the daughters point of view for just a second 'dad found a new girlfriend in a year, I can't see him with a new woman, I want to talk about mom with him, maybe just talk to him alone, he doesn't seem interested in me at all anymore'.\n\nOP also shows no concern for his daughter's grieving process, he doesn't even make the connection between this and her behaviour. It's great the dad moved on but the daughter can't just find a new mom to be there for her. She's essentially lost both parents at this stage.\n\nThen lastly, what really makes him the A is not the fact he wants her to apologise but also made it a condition his new girlfriend must accept the apology, he puts his daughters education into his girlfriend's hands. Fuck that seriously, OP needs to be a proper parent not worry about his girlfriend happiness while his daughter suffers.\n\nEdit: I've said before it's not acceptable but understandable and blackmailing her by destroying her future won't solve anything, that's just shitty and selfish parenting.",

I think using money to force an apology isn't the way to get a genuine apology because to her you're now the guy who moved on from her mom with someone new and forcing her into student loan debt. If she apologizes, I doubt it'll be genuine and she may cut ties with you in the future over using the money as a manipulation tactic. Everyone is hurting right now, and your daughter is acting very rudely to your girlfriend, have you actually talked to her about why she's treating her this way? It's like you're putting more effort in taking away money than you are in talking to your daughter to figure out the root cause. Another thing to consider is the deceased wife contributed to saving up the funds for her daughter's education. That money is intended for her to use for school, and that should be honored. At the end of the day that money is for the daughter to use for her education. That money is not conditional to not being a brat towards dad's new girlfriend. It's wrong to be a brat, and it's damaging to those relationships, but has nothing to do with her college funds. Removing a child's access to education isn't being a parent (or caring).",

She can't replace her with a new mom like you can replace her with a new GF. Maybe she's suffering because she's not ready to see her mom's place at the table be replaced with someone else.

            "comment": "ESH \n\nYour daughter is CLEARLY not over loosing her mom, and then seeing you REPLACE her mom not even 2 years after she\u2019s gone is probably like a knife in the heart. Just because she says she\u2019s fine, doesn\u2019t mean she is. Think from your daughters perspective. Your mom dies, tragically and unexpected, then a year later dad has already moved on with a new woman, while you\u2019re still having a rough time. I guarantee you A is still grieving, and while it doesn\u2019t make it ok for her to lash out, you need to understand where its coming from. She\u2019s not doing it to be evil, she\u2019s hurt. \n\nWhile I can see why your first instinct would be to punish her,  realistically you\u2019re driving her further away. this isn\u2019t just a girl whose being a brat, it\u2019s a girl who lost the most important person in the world for her, and probably feels like she\u2019s loosing you too to this new woman. I would bet my left hand that she feels incredibly lonely and overwhelmed with all the change. Your daughter is in pain right now. It\u2019s great you got over the death of your wife so quickly and are able to move on, but your daughter isn\u2019t. You can get another wife, she will never get another mom, but she probably feels like you\u2019re trying to force her with a new one. \n\nWhat will happen is she refuses to apologize? She\u2019ll have to drop out of school since she can\u2019t pay. Where will she go, I\u2019m guessing you won\u2019t let her live with you and your new GF. Do you know what happens to desperate 19 y/o females with no where to go? Hint: it\u2019s not good. If I was in your daughters shoes, and you set it up like \u201capologize to my GF, or I\u2019m not paying for your school anymore\u201d I would think \u201cclearly she\u2019s more important to him than I am and what I\u2019m going through.\u201d and I would resent your GF SO MUCH (because she probably feels like you are choosing GF over her) that you would never get an apology from me, or hear from me again. Yes your daughter was wrong, but she is in way too much pain to see that, or really to think clearly. \n\nIf I were you I would tell her I\u2019d still be willing to pay for school, but only if you attend counseling sessions, and some we can go to together, because this type of aggressive behavior is unacceptable, and we have to get to the bottom of it. If the counseling works, she will come to the conclusion to apologize on her own, and wouldn\u2019t that apology mean more than one you are forcing out of her anyway? If she apologizes now just because you make her, and not because she\u2019s actually sorry, it\u2019s only a matter of time before something like this happens again.",

Forcing her to drop out and destroying her career, if that\u2019s what happens, seems like a self perpetuating cycle of resentment, and you need to bear in mind that if this isn\u2019t handled delicately you risk losing your daughter as well as your wife. \n\nCould you maybe give her a chance to earn it back if she sees a grief counselor and works towards finding a way to mourn her loss that doesn\u2019t involve lashing out at those around her?",

You cancelled her tuition for being mean to your girlfriend. This is like taking away food for a week from a kid who hit you. The punishment does not fit the crime here. Your daughter sees this as you putting your new girlfriend above her future. And on top of it, this will not fix the relationship between your daughter and girlfriend. This will further their divide.

Her mother died, and her father is dating someone else, don't you think that might be hard for her to deal with? You could be a little more sensitive in helping her get used to the way life is now. I think you asking her to apologize is fine, but now that you've cancelled her university payment, what now? Now your 19 year old daughter can't go to university. So she doesn't get and education? Throwing a tantrum doesn't work for her, and won't work for you.",

And even though I disagree with not paying her tuition, as her education should be part of what parents do for children, I do agree with consequence for her actions. It's not a matter of choosing your gf over your daughter, it's a matter of your adult daughter showing basic respect to someone who will be in your life, whether she likes it or not",

            "comment": "Thats an incredible A-hole move on both of your parts.  Consider this (I am a widow with adult children to boot as well).  Everyone grieves differently and your daughter may still be grieving in her own way.  There are no set standards as to how long grief goes on.  For me, it\u2019s been about 15yrs and I have dated now and then after but the scent of the cologne he wore of someone passing by still brings back memories.  Your daughter may have animosity because she may feel her mother is being replaced.  That has nothing to do with you or your new gf.  Your daughter\u2019s feelings need to be validated and perhaps some grief therapy as well.  The move on your part, in essence, gives her an ultimatum to try to force her to like this new GF and therefore invalidates her feelings and her grief.  I agree that she had no right to project her anger on your gf, but pulling away her schooling could cause more damage to her emotionally as that may be one of the few places where she is able to immerse herself emotionally and she may need that.  Having my two in college, I have learned that they are learning about themselves and the world around them while growing as individuals.  Ultimatums in any form isn\u2019t an effective form of punishment for irreprensible behavior, especially in this case.  Have a sit down one on one with your daughter because her pushing away your gf may be her way of saying she needs her dad more than ever right now as you are ready to move forward, but she isn\u2019t quite there yet.  Good luck to your family.",

Id ask yourself what would your ex wife think if she knew you had cut off your daughters tuition threatening her future over a new girlfriend?!\n\nYour daughters mum died in the last year and you have in a relatively short time found a new girlfriend, this I dont think is wrong but to have her over for such a major family holiday so short after your wifes death and then siding with your new woman over your daughter who is clearly still grieving is harsh. To cut off her tuition over it is disgusting from a father. Your girlfriend might be gone in six months, your daughter is your daughter and the offspring of your ex and much loved wife (so you say). Put your daughters first not your dick!",

            "comment": "I know four people whose fathers cut off tuition while they were in college. \n\nOne started talking to his dad again after eight years and is willing to talk to him or meet in person up to 4-5 times a year. They live two miles apart. He did manage to finish college, but a decade out the student loans are still limiting his choices. \n\nOne started talking to her dad again after 10+ years, but will only talk via email and still refuses to chat with him on the phone or travel a few hundred miles to meet him. She dropped out of college after two years and is still paying off loans. \n\nOne has not spoken to his father in 12 years, says he will never speak to him again, and has given serious consideration to changing his last name to distance himself further from his dad. He dropped out of the Ivy League school he was attending and transferred to a third-tier state university but did manage to graduate with only modest debt. \n\nThe fourth is my mother. She dropped out of college and got married while still in her teens and did not invite grandpa to her wedding. She did not cut him off but her relationship with him was strained for the rest of his life. We (the gradkids) only got to see him every few years. My mom got a college degree when she was 50. \n\nThe idea that understanding who is the bigger asshole is your primary concern makes me sad. You are endangering your daughter\u2019s financial future. You are endangering your relationship with your daughter. You are putting at risk any future relationships you might otherwise have with grandkids. \n\nYes, your daughter was an asshole and a brat. Instead of responding like you too are an asshole and a brat, how about you step up and behave like a parent? Maybe you were able to lean on your deceased wife to manage emotionally complex parenting challenges in the past, but she is dead now, and you have just shown your daughter that the thing she fears most \u2014 the loss of her mom is the loss of her only loving parent \u2014 is true.",

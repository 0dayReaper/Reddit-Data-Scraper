    "postText": "I (24M) live in a duplex. Been here for the last 5 years. My building has a single front door that both apartments use, that enters into a small foyer with stairs about 4ft away or so that lead up to the apartment upstairs. When I moved in, I had friendly, slightly older neighbors (I\u2019ll call Jack and Jill) that didn\u2019t cause any issues, were relatively quiet and when packages were delivered for me; Jack would bring them inside, place them in the foyer and I started doing the same for them. Never had any issues with that and they would thank me and I thanked them.\n\nUnfortunately, in February of 2022; Jill passed away. Jack moved out 9 months later. January 2023, new neighbor (NN) moved in. She\u2019s around 40ish in age, I guess. She\u2019s relatively quiet, doesn\u2019t cause issues, I\u2019ve barely had a conversation outside of a greeting in the evening when I come home from work. She\u2019s got a lovely Golden Retriever which occasionally barks but meh; it\u2019s a dog, dogs bark. No real big issues with her.\n\nI continued to do what I did for Jack and Jill with deliveries; bringing her boxes inside, leaving them in the foyer for her. She never returned the gesture, which is fine since I\u2019ve started ordering less and less; she never said anything about it until about the month of April. I go out to get the mail and see four packages; two fairly large ones and two smaller ones, all addressed to her and pick the two large ones up, carrying them inside when she comes down the stairs with two other women. She asks what I was doing and I tell them that I was just bringing them inside. She says that they were on their way down to get them, so I hand over the two I had while one of the ladies retrieves the other two. I turn, head back inside my apartment and as they\u2019re going back upstairs, NN says \u201cI Can\u2019t believe he tried to steal these. I should call the cops.\u201d with the other two agreeing. I wanted to go tell her that again, I wasn\u2019t stealing anything but decided to let it go.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, I\u2019m off work and watching tv when at 2:36p.m., I see UPS pull up. The driver puts two packages on the porch. I go check the mail and the boxes are for NN. I leave them on the porch, go back inside and end up falling asleep watching t.v. Around 4p.m; I\u2019m awakened by NN knocking. I opened the door and she asks if I have her packages. I say no, I don\u2019t have them. NN says the app shows that they were delivered this afternoon. I said I saw them on the porch earlier but left them alone. NN got upset at me, said since one of the boxes had something expensive in it and since I was home; I could\u2019ve bought them inside the foyer like I\u2019ve done before. I told her that I didn\u2019t want to be accused of being a thief again. She called me an AH, repeated that one of the packages had expensive stuff inside and then stomped upstairs, slamming her door.\n\nSo AITA for not bringing her deliveries inside and leaving them to be porch pirated?",

I have been bringing in your packages to keep them safe since you moved in and you've never once said thank you. Now, the first time we encounter each other during this, you accuse me of stealing? How did you think all your packages were getting inside this whole time? Of course I'm never touching your packages again now that you've called me a thief and have refused to take it back or apologize.",

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (24M) live in a duplex. Been here for the last 5 years. My building has a single front door that both apartments use, that enters into a small foyer with stairs about 4ft away or so that lead up to the apartment upstairs. When I moved in, I had friendly, slightly older neighbors (I\u2019ll call Jack and Jill) that didn\u2019t cause any issues, were relatively quiet and when packages were delivered for me; Jack would bring them inside, place them in the foyer and I started doing the same for them. Never had any issues with that and they would thank me and I thanked them.\n\nUnfortunately, in February of 2022; Jill passed away. Jack moved out 9 months later. January 2023, new neighbor (NN) moved in. She\u2019s around 40ish in age, I guess. She\u2019s relatively quiet, doesn\u2019t cause issues, I\u2019ve barely had a conversation outside of a greeting in the evening when I come home from work. She\u2019s got a lovely Golden Retriever which occasionally barks but meh; it\u2019s a dog, dogs bark. No real big issues with her.\n\nI continued to do what I did for Jack and Jill with deliveries; bringing her boxes inside, leaving them in the foyer for her. She never returned the gesture, which is fine since I\u2019ve started ordering less and less; she never said anything about it until about the month of April. I go out to get the mail and see four packages; two fairly large ones and two smaller ones, all addressed to her and pick the two large ones up, carrying them inside when she comes down the stairs with two other women. She asks what I was doing and I tell them that I was just bringing them inside. She says that they were on their way down to get them, so I hand over the two I had while one of the ladies retrieves the other two. I turn, head back inside my apartment and as they\u2019re going back upstairs, NN says \u201cI Can\u2019t believe he tried to steal these. I should call the cops.\u201d with the other two agreeing. I wanted to go tell her that again, I wasn\u2019t stealing anything but decided to let it go.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, I\u2019m off work and watching tv when at 2:36p.m., I see UPS pull up. The driver puts two packages on the porch. I go check the mail and the boxes are for NN. I leave them on the porch, go back inside and end up falling asleep watching t.v. Around 4p.m; I\u2019m awakened by NN knocking. I opened the door and she asks if I have her packages. I say no, I don\u2019t have them. NN says the app shows that they were delivered this afternoon. I said I saw them on the porch earlier but left them alone. NN got upset at me, said since one of the boxes had something expensive in it and since I was home; I could\u2019ve bought them inside the foyer like I\u2019ve done before. I told her that I didn\u2019t want to be accused of being a thief again. She called me an AH, repeated that one of the packages had expensive stuff inside and then stomped upstairs, slamming her door.\n\nSo AITA for not bringing her deliveries inside and leaving them to be porch pirated?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

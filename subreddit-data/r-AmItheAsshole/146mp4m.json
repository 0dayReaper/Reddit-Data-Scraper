But at the same time there is a limit to everything and you're right to point out you're her son, not her labourer.

She can't use the *\"but I'm your mum\"* card if she doesn't bother having contact unless there is a material benefit to her.",

This is where things started to get a bit worse.\n\nAt one point I spent 4 full weekends helping get the house in order, painting, plastering, moving a lot of furniture by myself as mum finds it hard to lift things. These weekends were bookended by a very stressful time at work so I didn't get a chance to decompress at all.\n\nThis trend has somewhat continued to the point where for the last 6 months, the only time I've seen mum is when she's needed things done.\n\nToday, I got asked to do a \"quick 30min job\". Which was grouting the tiles on the back deck. This process, purely because she wanted to do it without a tradie, ended up taking 3 hours.\n\nI was quite annoyed because if she couldn't afford to get someone to help I would have chipped in but it seemed like she just didn't want to pay someone to do a job she wasn't really prepared to do.\n\nI ended up muttering to myself \"this is bullshit\" which was overheard and met with \"I'm your mum you should be helping me\". I'd agree with this if I wasn't already over at least once a week normally doing things for her but I kind of snapped and said \"yeah I'm your son not a laborer\". \n\nThat lead to a whole tyrade about how I'm terrible, she's going to move to another state, I probably tell me partner who will say she's a bitch, she won't get to see her grandchildren (I don't have children), she's going to break all contact with me, etc. You get the idea.\n\nI feel like a dickhead for snapping like that but at the same time feel it's been taken way further than it needed to.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "comment": "NTA. And she's emotionally manipulating you, by going on a 'poor me'/victimhood tirade when you spoke up for yourself. She wants you to feel guilty for challenging her, in hopes you won't do it again. \n\nIs this a common thing in your relationship with your Mum? Because under the circumstances, you didn't say anything over-the-top at all (yet you think you shouldn't have 'snapped'). And you also considered helping her pay a labourer, even though that is NOT even vaguely your responsibility. So you seem to feel a disproportionate sense of guilt/pressure in relation to your Mum, (which your Mum has probably instilled in you). \n\nYou don't actually owe her ANY help. Sure, family members do help out, but it isn't a requirement. And when family DO help out, it's unhealthy if somebody is giving too much time (at cost to themselves), and/or the person (being helped) has a sense of entitlement/ingratitude. As your Mum, she should be concerned about you getting rest, decompressing, etc. Instead, she's being very selfish and exploitative. \n\nYou really need to put up some healthy boundaries with your Mum, or she'll never stop this behaviour (in relation to various things in your life). Decide how much time you CAN actually afford, without it impeding too much on your own life/rest/free time, etc. And it's fine, if that's NO MORE time working on the house. It's down to your Mum to find solutions. \n\nWhatever you decide, tell your Mum (and why - how you're getting no rest, etc.). Then stick to those boundaries, no matter what manipulation your Mum then attempts (that's really important - because if she finds your boundaries can be eroded, she'll keep trying to erode them in future). And whenever she goes off on a 'tirade', tell her you won't speak to her until she stops the guilt-tripping. Good luck!",

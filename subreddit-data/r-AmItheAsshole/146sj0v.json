    "postText": "So my (46M) son\u2019s (19M) birthday was yesterday. A few weeks before his birthday he and my wife (48F, also his mother) got into an argument over something really petty if I\u2019m being honest. This happens a lot she will find the smallest things to complain to him about. But due to this argument, she refused to plan anything for his birthday. So I started to plan it.\r  \n\r  \nNow before anyone thinks I went and planned a massive party, by plan I mean get him some presents, a cake and make sure we have money for take out that night (this is what we\u2019ve done for a while as he stopped wanting parties after 15 and even before then his birthday parties were really just small gatherings with a handful of friends) now I\u2019m going to be honest here, I don\u2019t know much about my son\u2019s interest. I know what he\u2019s into but not enough information about specifics to get him anything. But I do know the person that knows him better than anyone is his best friend who I will call \u201cAlice\u201d (18F)\r  \n\r  \nSo I called Alice and asked her about what kind of things my son would like as a present. She was immediately able to help me. I know my son loves K-pop but she was able to show me what albums he would like and ended up getting him one that released very recently (I actually had to preorder it after we had the phone call) from his favourite group. As Well as these small picture cards of his favourite member.\r  \n\r  \nThe conversation somehow also ended up at cakes and she was also able to help me with what kind of cake is his favourite. And what things to avoid (like buttercream as it makes him feel ill) and I got everything sorted.\r  \n\r  \nHis birthday came and I made him and everyone breakfast before work. And when I got back we opened presents ordered food and did the cake. When I say we I mean me, my son, my daughters and my MIL who lives with us. My wife seemed upset and did not join us. She came down to get some food and some cake and take it to our room to eat.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I went to bed I asked her what was up and she said she felt like I was trying to upstage her, and that our son favours me anyway and I\u2019m not helping. She knows that neither of us know enough about K-pop to have gotten him stuff to do with his favourite group without help and told her I asked Alice for help with the gift and cake she got upset again and said I was proving her point. She then just went off complaining how she was excluded and she didn\u2019t like the cake and that no one had paid any attention to her and had left her out of everything.\r  \n\r  \nShe kept interrupting me as I tried to apologise to I just gave up and slept on the sofa. I know my wife and know she can be unreasonable at times but I am wondering if I\u2019m TA.\r",

It\u2019s fairly presumptuous of me to bandy that word about. \n\nIt is true that it\u2019s just a word, and that it does have direct bearing on the conversation, however there\u2019s many words I grew up with in common parlance that are considered epithets and slurs today.

It\u2019s usually always the connotations that change first, before the definition. \n\nUnderstanding that the word had an origin 2000 years previous to the present doesn\u2019t mean that the word hasn\u2019t changed. \n\nIn this case I truly believe that it has. I also believe that it\u2019s healthier to not bandy it about as I stated. \n\nI mean lets face it, the N word literally was defined by the word \u201cignorant\u201d until the 1980\u2019s, in multiple dictionaries. In itself the word \u201c ignorant \u201c is not racist, but the N word most assuredly was, it had it\u2019s roots in racism. \n\nIn this case it\u2019s guilt by association, I deplore the use of the N word, and the term ignorant, or even ignorance. \n\nAfter seeing the above redditor speak on it, I felt compelled to state that I believed their stance is healthier, at least for myself. \n\nYou can continue to do what you will.\n\nEdit: To make it abundantly clear, I am in no way shape or form saying that calling someone narcissistic is equivalent to a racist slur, i am simply pointing out the absurdity of the idea that the connotations of a word and even the definition of it should remain unchallenged.",

Then, when shown proof that he is not a thief, she decides to discount that and is continuing to do so. In order to punish the crime that only she and the voices in her head believe your son committed, she decided he doesn't get to have anything for his birthday. She is now in a snit because you made his birthday special when she wanted it to be as miserable as she is. Did I miss anything? \n\nYour wife is an AH. She told you why she's really being like this: she thought everything would be about her. If your son didn't have his celebration, everyone would have asked why, and she could then air her grievances and get some sympathy. Instead, you gave him an awesome birthday, and even when she sulked in her bedroom like a moody child, no one bothered with her. The birthday was shockingly about your son, and not about Mrs. \"I won't admit I'm wrong and want everything to be about me.\"\n\nSo I have to ask: does she do this often? You say she's unreasonable, but this is a step far beyond that. Your son proved his innocence, and she still wanted to punish him. She was determined that his birthday be ignored, that he be left feeling hurt and unvalued, because she cannot admit she's wrong and she will not admit that she's to blame for losing her air pods. She's now angry that you didn't play along, aggrieved no one was begging her sulky self to come downstairs or grovelling for forgiveness, and is royally miffed that she rightfully looks bloody awful for not making any effort for her own child's birthday. She's trying to push her guilt onto you; in her mind, the problem isn't  that she's being unreasonable and awful, it's that you showed her up. Your wife needs serious help if this is her normal way of operating.\n\nShe's manipulating you into apologising for something that doesn't warrant an apology by making you feel bad. Instead of accepting the apology, she kept trying to hammer the point home that you're wrong because if she paused in her monologue for even a second, you might realise that she's being selfish and awful. She was being manipulative by sulking in her bedroom because she thought the silent treatment would make you or your son go grovel to get her downstairs. She's refusing to admit she's wrong and is determined to hurt your son to prove a point. What point? That when mum is irresponsible enough to lose her stuff, one of the kids must admit to being a thief or else. \n\nNTA, although perhaps invite Alice for a film night or something to say thanks. As others said, she should really have been invited to the birthday thing, but a film night will do, especially if you make sure to get her favourite snacks/food.",

Loved my father and did a lot with him, but I didn't really ever talk about personal preferences or my own shit. Just life and whatever else.

You acknowledge your wife started a petty argument with her child and refused to acknowledge his birthday as punishment (*but still helped herself to his bday cake*)? And because your wife is furious you didn't centre her and her cake preferences on your child's birthday, you're questioning if acknowledging your child's birthday was the right thing to do?\n\nHave you ever read the viral Reddit Don't Rock the boat post? https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/ I recommend you read it and see if the metaphor can be applied to your family. Frankly it's concerning you think it's ok for your wife not to apologise to her son for their argument and to ignore him on his birthday. It's appalling your family is so centred around your wife neither of you know your children very well. YTA because this dynamic didn't happen overnight, you are enabling your wife to be awful to her kids by staying silent (*or apologising*) when she's out of line. That's not ok. Not at all.",

Having put effort into knowing some of the graphic novels, cartoons and anime shows my youngest likes, I know it is TOUGH. I think he just stressed his lack of knowledge about his son's likes (including what kind of cake he likes) - so I had this sense he spends no time sharing his son's interests; but I may have been too hard on him.\n\nAlso agreed that OP clearly cares about his son AND that the wife's behavior is very unhealthy.",

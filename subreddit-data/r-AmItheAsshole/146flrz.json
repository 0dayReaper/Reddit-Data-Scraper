    "postText": "\nDoes my (26M) OCD gf (25F) have anger issues or is it me that\u2019s being an asshole?\n\n\nMy gf (25F) and I (26M) have been dating for a bout two years and we recently moved in together.\n\nAt first everything was good, she would get angry at me sometimes for valid stuff that I completely agree was my fault. I lived with my mom beforehand and our house was always cluttered and she knew I disliked it and it stressed me out. We both considered ourself OCD and thought it would be a good idea to move in together.\n\nFast forward to living with her for almost 5 months and she will literally explode on me for the smallest things I do that are not perfect. To list a few examples; \n\n- putting a new onion from groceries in the fridge rather than the cabinet\n- not folding the hand towel perfectly on the rack after washing my hands\n- not folding the sofa blanket before going to bed\n-  leaving my keys on the front entrance table instead of putting it in the bowl\n\nI realize that each one of these things individually is something I could easily fix and I have been trying but I don\u2019t even have any room for error. If I wash my hands 10 times during the day, if the hand towel is not replaced perfectly only once I will literally get screamed at. She says stuff like, \u201cyou don\u2019t do anything for the house\u201d or  \u201cI always have to clean up after your mess\u201d and she usually tells me that I was raised in a barn.\n\nOne of the most notable consistent events are on the weekends when it\u2019s time to deep clean the place, which is a weekly event. It usually starts off well and then if she doesn\u2019t like the way I am doing something, income the insults about me. I am not normally an angry person but as a human being there is only so much heat I can take before I get angry back. Usually this ends in a fight and me exploding back and her completely over stimulated with emotion and anger that she tells me to leave because she doesn\u2019t want to look at me, and she will clean the rest of the place. It\u2019s like clock work every weekend.\n\nIt usually ends with her calling me an asshole for not just agreeing with her and saying sorry. But I am just trying to defend myself, I admit I do get worked up when she yells at me and raise my voice. If she would just listen to me all I say is that I am trying to help and be involved in the maintenance.\n\nThe part that gets me angry is that she tells me she does 90% of the work around the house and all she wants is help and she will be happy. I am completely on board with helping and being involved and I offer to help all the time though..\n\nI have an appointment booked with a therapist this week because I literally don\u2019t know what to do and it\u2019s been getting a lot worse lately and I don\u2019t know if I could live with her anymore. Need to vent.\n\nTLDR: this could be AITA but I need advice. Gf is overboard OCD freak and gets overly angry at me for what I consider the smallest things on a consistent basis. I get angry back saying that I am helping best I can.",

Even when housemates violate previously agreed upon standards of housecleaning and chore distribution, this sort of explosion is unwarranted. \n\nThe fact that she does it every week sounds like you are the designated, i.e. safe, outlet for her to dump the pressure that's been building up in the rest of her life all week.\n\nWhen she's calm, sit down and divide the household chores. If you're waiting to be asked, that's not the same level of participation and may feel like a burden to the person who is initiating most of the cleanup. Also agree on standards. If you're not willing to guarantee meeting her OCD criteria in every area, put that out there during the chore discussion. \n\nYou can work with your own therapist about how far you want to accommodate her OCD quirks and how to draw the line when she becomes abusive towards you. You can't make her go to therapy. What she decides to do when you start to set clear, calm, consistent boundaries will help you make your own choices about the relationship.",

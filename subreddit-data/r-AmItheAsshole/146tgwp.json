    "postText": "We have 2 cats (1 x rescue, 1 from a kitten) who have had free roam inside and outside of our house for the last 3 years.\n\nAbout 6 months ago, our neighbour came around to complain that our 1 cat has taken to pooping in their garden and asked us to keep the cats inside. They asked we not let them out else they would call environmental health (we are based in the UK) so we have kept them in the house consistently despite them going crazy and not adapting at all well to being housecats.\n\nNow the weather is getting much warmer, our house is an oven with no way of cooling it down as opening any windows will let the cats out. My wife thinks we should go back to letting the cats out and thr neighbours will have to deal with it and I am inclined to agree. AITA?\n\nEdit: overwhelming YTA. Thanks as always for the moral steer people!",

In addition to that, cats left to wander outdoors have much shorter lives and can destroy native animal populations. The cats will probably adapt better if you look into enrichment activities for them. You can also get/build a catio for them to be outside in a safe, enclosed environment if you don't want to take them out on a cat leash and harness.",

Maybe look into installing a \"catio\" so they can get some sunshine and fresh air? Or look into some other type of pen you can keep them in without letting them roam the neighborhood. I really feel for your neighbor though as I am currently having the same issue with their cats. They have 4 cats that they let outside often, but they always come over to my house and use my flowerbeds as a litterbox. So whenever I go out to rake or plant things there is always a stinky surprise for me. They also have an intact male cat that sprays around my flowerbeds and shrubs as well. Instead of complaining to my neighbor I just went to my local home and garden store and purchased some cat deterrent crystals I sprinkle around my property now. It doesn't hurt the cats, they just don't like it and stay away. Maybe you could try something like that around the border of your property to keep them from wandering? I understand you want to let them out, but there are solutions out there that can work out for everyone and your cats.\n\nEdit: Spelling",

They asked we not let them out else they would call environmental health (we are based in the UK) so we have kept them in the house consistently despite them going crazy and not adapting at all well to being housecats.\n\nNow the weather is getting much warmer, our house is an oven with no way of cooling it down as opening any windows will let the cats out. My wife thinks we should go back to letting the cats out and thr neighbours will have to deal with it and I am inclined to agree. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

CAt proofing your garden is one (expensive) option, as is building a 'catio',   but you could also look at things like continuing to provide them with litter trays indoors, and keep them in at night, and make sure that they have places in your own garden to use - use a little of the dirty litter from their trays to mark sutablespots, and make sure you pick up after them regularly , and that the place you want them to use feels safe to them. (When training a previous cat, I had a covered litter tray indoors and then took the cover and out it on the relevant section of my garden. Cat felt safe as it was familiar and he couldn't be crept up on, and I just had to clean up regularly. ) I'd suggest  you  offer to buy your neighbours deterrent they can use in their garden for the first few weeks after you start letting them out again, so that they don't get n the habit of using their garden .(You can buy gels and powders for this purpose at garden centres, they are usually either strongly cotrussy or garlic scented. I have always found the citrus ones more effective (and pleasanter to be around!) but YMMV\n\nEnvironmental health won't be interested. Cats have a different legal status from dogs in this country.",

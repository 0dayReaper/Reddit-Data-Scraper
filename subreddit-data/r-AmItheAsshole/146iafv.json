(This is not his actual name, this is for privacy) I used to be friends with Dave. But Dave had a crush on me since he met me, but I didn't feel the same. He would get mad and guilt trip me, saying he wasn't good enough. And then things went south and I decided to end this all together. He did not take no for an answer. It took a month of arguing, convincing, begging, and guilt tripping until he finally stopped. I've moved away since then and he's tried to contact me. But from what I've heard from a friend, he hasn't changed in the past three years. So I've been ignoring him but I also feel like I should give him a chance. AITA?",

This guy:\n\nGot mad at you for not returning his feelings\n\nGuilt tripped and emotionally manipulated you\n\nDid something so bad that \"things went south\" *after* the manipulation\n\nForced you to beg and argue for your right to be left alone\n\nContinued contacting you after you moved away\n\nHasn't seen you in three years *but is still obsessed with you*. *After three years of no contact when he hasn't seen you since middle school.*\n\nAny one of these things alone would be reason enough to cut contact with him. But together? This is heading into stalker territory. Maintain no contact. If you give people like this an inch, they'll take a mile. If he continues contacting you, it might be time to consider a restraining order. \n\nThis is not normal or healthy behavior. It is abusive. There is never a reason you should give someone a chance if you're not attracted to them, and a decent guy wouldn't expect you to anyway. But this isn't even a normal situation, it is an extremally dangerous one.",

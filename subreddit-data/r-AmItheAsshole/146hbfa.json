Me not telling my father about my graduation or even the dates of it may make me the asshole because it is an important moment in everyone\u2019s life.\n\n2. This might make me the asshole because my mother and all my siblings are coming to my graduation and he is not. I also want to add that he does not live in the same country as me, so that was an additional reason as to why I didn\u2019t even tell him.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If he wanted to be at your graduation he should have asked.  If your mother thought he should be there, she should have told him.\n\nCongratulations on your graduation!  It sounds like you\u2019ve already done well for yourself.  You have a bright future, don\u2019t let this get in your way.",

In the last 5 years, you have only spoken to another a handful of times; that's not much of a relationship and certainly isn't a close one. I hope you can talk some sense in your father. OP, you're an adult now, so you have to make the decision on whether you want to keep him in your life or not.",

My mom encouraged me to look him up on Facebook when I was about 17 and that was when we got in contact. Since then, we speak to one another maybe 1-5 times a year. Even for this year, the last time we spoke was on my birthday (which was February). Well anyway, my mom and him have good friendship \u2014 they rarely talk but when they do, it\u2019s never animosity or resentment. My mom called him today to tell him that I am graduating college next Friday. My dad got angry at this and blamed me for not telling him the dates of my graduation. My mom told him that \u201cmaybe it\u2019s because you two don\u2019t have a close relationship\u201d. My dad got even angrier at this comment. My mom even said that my dad was under the impression my graduation was in 2022 \u2014 which does not make sense because when he called for my birthday, he even mentioned my graduation and how it was my final year in college. Anyway, he later then called me and got mad at me for not telling him the date for my graduation. My mom also says I\u2019m wrong for not telling him about my graduation. For additional context, my dad has remarried and has his own children and my mom is also in a relationship. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

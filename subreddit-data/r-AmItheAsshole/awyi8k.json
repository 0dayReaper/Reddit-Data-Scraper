You have done nothing to sign up for taking care of another human being (it's not like she's your kid), and that was wrong of your dad to \"joke\" about, because it sounds like he probably is really thinking along those lines.\n\nBe honest with your parents about how you feel- make clear that it's insane that you're expected to be a full-time babysitter (grounded for no phone in a theater? That's fucking bullshit).",

Anyway, autism will likely never have a CURE per se, because it\u2019s a type of mutation/bad link of dna/protein so to speak! It\u2019s way more complicated than that but I\u2019m keeping this short. To really \u201cfix\u201d autism, we\u2019d have to truly find out how to identify it before birth and either wipe it out completely or turn it into a supplemental medicinal item all human life will have to take as they grow up. \n\nAutism is way more complicated than that though. There\u2019s so many kinds. But one main point I\u2019ve noticed with the people in my life who have autism is they\u2019re very fragile. Lacking protein. Brittle bones. Etc. They\u2019re getting closer though. They\u2019ve made a good leap within the past 3 years I\u2019ve heard! \n\nThere\u2019s many scholarly articles if you ever get bored! They\u2019re super fascinating! ",

Now it\u2019s one diagnoses of autism and from there they add details and specialize them depending on criteria and how they function. No one gets the same exact plan. They\u2019re not just oh you have autism here this is what you do. It\u2019s much more personalized and tailored now. \n\nSo there\u2019s low functioning to high functioning, as you know. Cognitive skills. Reading and language skills. We have savants. There\u2019s Asperger\u2019s. Motor skills. Sensory issues can vary. So for whatever reasoning, whatever the caused the autism is different for everyone. Protein binding wrong or missing, mutated, chromosome binded wrong, dna/rna wrong. It could be anything. But autism is in the DNA. This isn\u2019t an easy one to fix. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s in the brain or an organ and we can take a pill to fix it while alive. \n\nI knew a family with 5 children. Out of the 5, 3 had autism. The first two had other serious illnesses of the brain. The oldest had non epileptic and epileptic grand mal seizures. Still not sure what causes them to this day. Second child has severe bipolar disorder. She\u2019s probably the luckiest. Third child is the only boy, he has Asperger\u2019s. He has trouble staying in school, and is throwing everything else away for an abusive relationship with this girl. She\u2019s awful. Fourth youngest has high functioning autism. Her siblings think she\u2019s annoying. She likes attention and she has a lack of a filter. She\u2019s very excitable. I would say she\u2019s more atypical. Then we have the youngest. She\u2019s very low functioning. She\u2019ll always need her mom. She has fine vocal skills and she can communicate well. She\u2019s a total sweetheart. But she doesn\u2019t understand certain things and she has a severe sensory disorder. Things can\u2019t be too loud or her ears hurt and she screams and has a freak out. You cannot brush her hair even with the gentlest of brushes. It hurts her so bad. She has a stuffed owl named bill that she refuses to get rid of. He\u2019s dirty and old but he\u2019s her attachment. She\u2019s very fragile and gets hurt often. \n\nSo clearly the youngest\u2019s autism is more of a protein dna mutation kind of mistake. It didn\u2019t form properly or something of that sort. She hurts easily and breaks bones easily. But that\u2019s just one part of her autism. I haven\u2019t seen this family in about 4 years... friend moved to England with her fianc\u00e9 and I moved states. Youngest child should be about 9-10 now. I do hope they\u2019re doing well. \n\nAnd fun fact: yes these parents do know they should have stopped having children after the second child per every doctor they ever saw. Every child was a C section. But they\u2019re catholic and never used protection. So here they are. Don\u2019t know if it had anything to do with it. ",

Some do not need help with activities of daily living, can hold a job, have adequate  judgment and insight to be able to know what to do in emergencies (if there\u2019s a fire, for example), and have only slight processing issues. Some do NOT. \n\nOP is stating that her sister is non-verbal\u2014depending on her functioning she may be able to say a handful of words. She may or may not be able to indicate her needs in non-verbal ways. OP also states that her sister needs 24/7 supervision. This is not something that indicates her sister is high functioning. Some individuals on the spectrum suffer from hypersensory overload to the extent that loud noises can trigger seizures. Some individuals on the spectrum CANNOT interpret body language of others, have not developed empathy and do not have a functional ability to navigate social scenarios. For individuals with severe Autism, \n\nTHIS IS ABSOLUTELY NOT DUE TO HOW HE OR SHE IS RAISED. \n\nFor those that read his comment, please understand that this is from an individual who is stating his own personal experience. This is anecdotal on his part. The statements made about functioning are not in line with actual diagnostic data in regards to individuals on the spectrum and the varied levels of severity possible with this condition. Sometimes, despite intensive intervention, life skills programs, and doing everything exactly correctly a person on the spectrum may still be extremely low functioning. ",

OP, my advice is to get your education and move out of that house ASAP and NEVER allow yourself to be sucked back in. Once you are financially independent you can make absolutely clear that you are not going to be responsible for your sister's care. Period. You are under NO obligation to make your adult life about taking care of your sister. Your parents should be making some plans on how your sister will be taken care of after they are gone independent from you. The sooner you make this clear to them the less \"guilty\" you may feel for not taking on this responsibility. After all, they will have had plenty of time to make arrangements.\n\nAnd I only say \"financially independent\" because I'm afraid that it the OP took such a firm stand now her parents wouldn't help her financially with her education ect if they are able.

We have been fortunate that in his 30s he is able to care for his own need with support from the local regional group.\n\nI am also a sped teacher. I\u2019ve worked in mod/severe with plenty of students who are nonverbal WITH low cognitive ability (doesn\u2019t matter the disability). If they can not communicate needs or take care of themselves independently in some regard then they need support 24/7.\n\nI had the same frustrations as you. I resorted to cutting, with holding food, and made the worst self mix tape in head about how I deserved to be 2nd best. I felt like a slave like you and eventually I let it go because I love my brother and it is not his fault that he is that way AND that my parents can\u2019t hang. My dad left for years at a time so I was the 2nd parent - I forgave him too. \n\nI was trained from the time I was 10 to care for my brother (he\u2019s about 8years younger). Our parents have died in the past 2 years and I am in charge. The key secret I can tell you about how I am a relatively sane and successful adult  is: make a plan NOW! I made a plan about how I wanted my like to look starting in 8th grade and I followed through. I took the SATs, got grants and scholarships, went to school far away and had jobs on and off campus. It was the Clinton era so they gave money if you have a single family income. Get a loan - research and do it! Follow through and stay on track because you are in charge of you! \n\nIf you ever want advice or to rant you can PM me. I also advise counseling - I really hurt myself and took on lots of guilt. You don\u2019t need that. Someone should say \u2018none of this is your fault\u2019 - I can be that person because it is the truth.\n\nI\u2019m here if needed.\ud83d\udcab\ud83c\udf1f\u2728",

I sure hope she has friends and or teachers at school that can make her understand the fact that things like that are wrong, though it sadly doesn't sound like it, because otherwise she will grow up to be spoiled and unbearable as an adult. She definitely deserves all the help she can get with her autism, but still, if she doesn't learn that she gets in trouble due to certain things, or if her parents keep teaching her that her autism is an excuse for every mistake she makes, she will likely grow up with few or no friends at all, and might get into serious trouble.\n\nSorry if this is badly written or if it doesn't explain what I mean very well, English isn't my first language, and I'm already fairly bad at explaining things.",

This isn\u2019t a lack of understanding of what that child\u2019s situation means, it\u2019s a desire to have some degree of normalcy. Not just for the child with severe autism, but for their siblings. It doesn\u2019t mean putting them in time out and just letting them self harm, it means finding a way to safely enforce some sort of discipline. Maybe it\u2019s a wasted effort depending on the severity of the child\u2019s autism, but it\u2019s not one for siblings. The other kids still need to learn rules, and they might not understand why their brother or sister gets a free pass when they\u2019re really little. In these situations, it\u2019s really important to help all the kids feel equally loved, and foster the sense of compassion instead of resentment. You just do what you can, if this works for them and the child with autism isn\u2019t negatively impacted it might help create a stronger bond between the siblings. ",

Autism is unique in every case, you can't relate two people because they are both autistic.\n\nYour family friend's son might be severely autistic and non-verbal as well, and he could also be receptive to punishment as a deterrent to bad behavior; while the sister here could simply not be capable to connecting the punishment to the behavior.\n\nMy brother is severely autistic, and he will take in punishments and memorize what we are saying to him, but it won't deter him from performing the task - he doesn't understand the connection between what he is doing, and what we are trying to teach him not to do. (For example, he likes pulling kid's hair, we think to get a reaction - like crying. We tried punishing him for this behavior, but it simply didn't work; what he wanted out of the bad behavior was the reaction, and punishments didn't work with him.) Sometimes you just need a different method to teach them right, like with my brother; my sister and I had to just learn to suck it up and not give him any reaction when he pulled our hair when we were younger. After he stopped getting the reaction, he would stop pulling hair - the punishment did nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically what I'm saying is, just because something works with one autistic person, doesn't mean it will work with everyone. Autism is a wide spectrum, with each case being very unique.",

My older brother has moderate to severe autism and was extremely volatile, violent, and would threaten to kill me (and tried) on a regular basis. Nothing was done. Eventually they figured out how to lock him in his own room, but then he broke the lock by ramming into his door enough times. The same way he'd try to break down my own door.\n\nSome of my earliest memories are when I'd be leaning against my bedroom door, scream crying for help while he'd repeatedly run full-force into my bedroom door, trying to break it down while shrieking OFF WITH HER HEAD! over and over again. Once he used a hammer.\n\nI was scolded for \"setting him off\". I stopped trusting my parents at a very young age and fell into a lifelong depression and other neurosis due to my disillusionment with life itself.",

Having a special needs child is incredibly difficult, and they've coped with it at the expense of the less needy child. \n\n\nOP, you don't have to care for your sister your whole life - your parents should be making a plan for her care. *They* chose to have a child, not you.  Just... Try not to let your feelings about how *you're* treated affect your feelings about her; she isn't in control of the situation any more than you are. ",

Oh my god, you've just terrified me that this is what's going to happen to my brother...He's 22, which I consider still plenty young for there to be hope, but he has actively said multiple times after age 18 that he has no plans to attend college or a training program, ever; no plans to get a \"job that will make him sad\" (no food service, no retail, no labor), and that his plan for making money is to become a game streamer (and even that, he hasn't made any actual attempt at.)\n\nI'm the only one of my siblings who moved out, and while I'm perfectly willing to help the sibling with legitimate reasons for not having done so who is also a pleasure to be around and dealing with their own issues in constructive ways, I absolutely refuse to take care of my brother if it comes down to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit- For context, my brother has ASD or \"mild Asperger's Syndrome.\" So he does need leeway with many things, I totally get that- but he's had professional support (therapy + meds) since Day 1 \n\nDoctors have literally said he is fully capable of caring for himself, going to college, and getting a job. If you were told he has Asperger's you might think \"oh, okay, that explains some things\" but you wouldn't be able to pick him out of a crowd of STEM majors. He is also far above the threshold for government assistance/disability/etc.\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar situation or resolved it, I'm serious, tell me. My parents were NOT young when they had kids and it horrifies me to think of them spending what should be their retirement years taking care of him. It's not like I want him to die in a gutter once they're gone, either- I just wish him a swift upward spiral of success somewhere far away from my parents, before their health inevitably declines.",

Like the fact that he has never had to wait in a long line at an amusement park because of her skip the line pass. :)   \n\n\nIt sounds like you parents haven't done any of this, and have, in fact made everything worse for you.

It's the same as saying, \"Finish your (gross) dinner, because there are starving children in the 3rd world.\" It's true, but one bears no relation to the other. If this advice worked for you, great! But I wouldn't recommend passing it around. It devalues the experience of the patient and places the blame for their troubles on them. ",

She probably can't help what's she's doing in a lot of instances because she's autistic. Doesn't give autistic people free reign to be a dick because some people can learn that \"we don't do these things because they're not nice\" and then try to stop doing them. But this girl is severely autistic. It may take a lot to learn that that behaviour is unacceptable and that it's not nice. So when she does things that average people wouldn't do, it's fair to say it's because she's severely autistic and, while its definitely not to say that she shouldn't be in trouble, it is because she's autistic and won't be able to help it.\n\nUnless you understand a lot about autism or you are autistic then I don't think the behaviour or how it's dealt with should be seen in such a clear cut, black and white view - it can be a lot more complicated. \n\nHowever, fuck this person's parents cause they're huge cunts.

Further my Grandmother is a specialist on the subject of autism and has worked with autistic and handicapped kids ranging from very light to absolutely menacing for the past 40 or so years.  \n\n\nFor example I have a gold lighter, the kid was not allowed to play with it for obvious reasons. He grabbed it, put it in his mouth and caused a scratch. Now personally I don't care for the scratch but if he swallowed it it would have been hard to get out short of puncturing below the lighter to keep him from suffocating until paramedics arived.   \n\n\nThe second time he was more hesitant to grab it but still did, I gently took it from his hand, told him no.  \n\n\nThe third time he looked 200 times at me and the lighter before he grabbed it. Same deal, Gently grabbed it out of his hand and said no. This is the discipline part I was talking about.   \n\n\nThis also proves in this specific instance the boy did understand what it is he was doing was wrong it just took a lot longer before he reached the \"fuck it\" moment.  \n\n\nFrom what I have gathered is that it is very important for autistic people to have a set in stone routine and be notified of any changes well in advance or it might cause a huge meltdown. It is upon the parent to adapt to this and set a healthy regiment and keep to it.  This is the routine.  \n\n\nIt is the responsibility of the parents to understand the needs of their children.  \n\n\nThis is my pool of information from where I wrote the comment and for what it is worth I am not autistic.  \n\n\nIt never is as cut and dry as I wrote it in the initial post and in this one as each individual differs and requires tailored treatment. I hope you will re-read my comment and understand the undertone in it that I am solemnly blaming the parents and not the autistic sister.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

While, obviously, she will require more care and attention her entire life, it is equally your parents' job to ensure you're well cared for, and that they have a plan for your sister once they're gone (and that plan is *not* \"let the sibling care for her\").\n\nNow, and here's where my opinion seems to deviate from the crowd here, you're the asshole for blaming this situation on your sister. She was born this way, and trust me, your parents would've turned the dial from \"severe autism\" to \"normal\" if such a dial had existed. They're scared, they're dealing (or not dealing) with something they don't understand, and they are inappropriately leaning on you for help. Your sister isn't, your parents are.

And you certainly are not qualified to care for her.\n\nI suggest looking into scholarships, because your parents may use the financial hold to keep you taking care of your sister when you should be focusing on your studies.\n\nWhen you get to college, see if they have mental health resources so you can talk to someone about all of this.

You are \n1) so important\n2) completely valid in your feelings\n3) a kid too\n\nWe have a similar situation in my family, but my aunt and uncle did their best to inspire their kids (all of them) to reach for their individual dreams while inspiring them to take care of my autistic cousin. He is severely autistic as well and to say it\u2019s a challenge is an understatement. \n\nMy suggestions - go to a college that isn\u2019t conveniently close to your parents. Yup! I mean it. They will not utilize you if you\u2019re not close. \n\nGo to a college campus therapist (or a school one in high school). It\u2019s time for you to learn to nurture and love yourself; clearly your parents didn\u2019t do that.\n\nForgive your parents. They fucked up. But raising a special needs child is so so hard. Although they did prioritize her, just realize that there wasn\u2019t really an option. Life isn\u2019t fair like that. Additionally, forgive your sister. She\u2019ll never know the joys in life that you and I will. I can\u2019t imagine what my cousin goes through on a day to day basis - is he ever afraid? What\u2019s going on in his head that I just can\u2019t reach? Realize your anger towards your sister is more about your parents.\n\nI am sorry for you. Like me, college will be the first time you get to \u201cbe you\u201d. I would encourage you to never rest until you get on that plane out of town. I wish you the best of luck, and I wish for you healing and love, even though you\u2019ve not been treated well. ",

I know you hate that she destroys everything, but her mental condition is not her fault at all. And how your parents treat you is not her fault either. Though your feelings about this are perfectly reasonable. But know that none of this is your sister's fault. Some people just don't know better, due to mental condition/disease.\n\nOnce you graduate college and once you can provide for yourself, cut ties with them if they don't realize what they're doing to you.",

When you don't volunteer information it puts your partner in the role of interrogation leader and builds uncertainty, because in the back of their mind they know that unless they ask the right questions there may always be things they don't know that may pertain to them or the relationship. Instead of keeping them in the loop and letting them make decisions and hold information, you use your own perspective to decide the best course of action for their sake. It's not as kind as you think.\n\nShe had an emotional reaction to this complete news and took it as a personal attack and went into defense mode, maybe because of the aforementioned loss of agency made it seem like it wasn't actually for her but used as a cop-out, maybe because that's her reaction to any sudden difference from her expectations. \n\nYou did also kinda use it as a cop-out, because you are tired of hearing these complaints but made it seem like it was just for her sake you did it. Maybe she picked up on this, as she did ask what else was going on and why YOU didn't want to sleep next to HER. Do you often claim to make a choice by thinking of others while it very much being informed by how it affects you? It's not wrong to include your own perspective when making choices, but if it's made out to be exclusively about others best interests then it'll quickly seem insincere and even manipulative and people pick up on these things subconsciously.\n\nI'm between ESH and NAH, because it's probably just a matter of communicating better for both of you, but the degree and frequency of poor communication would dictate my judgement here.\n\nTLDR: Be more proactive in your communication, tell her what's bothering you and ask her what she wants to do regarding issues that affect her or both of you (in this case it affects both of you and you need to make that clear).",

That said, i recommend you speak to your doctor since you have had this issue since childhood.  If you'd rather try something else first, invest in a bed that raises the head.  The head of the bed may not need to be raised much, but I know from experience that it makes all the difference. My husband snores like you when he gains weight.  The raised head on our bed takes pressure off his lungs and we can both sleep!  In hospitals nurses do that to help people breathe easier.  I wish you well.  She does not want to give up on sleeping with you.  Wishing you both all good things",

I didn't want to go to the doctor about it either. My dad has sleep apnea and I didn't want to deal with the mask. A year later I'm diagnosed and actually don't mind the mask. After some mild trial and error I found one that works. Sleep well apnea isn't the only cause of shoring it could be some hung much simpler do why not call the doctor? Not for your partner for you.\n\nAs for separate rooms not everyone likes that. Stigma around a keeping in different rooms is going away but it's still not for everyone. N A H there. But you should be willing to to do to the doctor and get your snoring checked out.",

We wanna get an apartment together very soon so we've been looking at places closer to our jobs. \n\nShe has expressed her annoyance with my snoring often. She says that I'm too loud, keep her up, snore in her ear, etc. I can't help that I snore and I wish I didn't because folks in my family talk shit and laugh about my snoring too. I don't think I have sleep apnea, I just snore. For this reason, (and as a coping mechanism I adopted when I was young to being teased/laughed at), I usually opt to be alone in my own space in isolation. Anyway, she's been looking at one bedroom apartments, I've been looking for two. She asked why I looked for 2 beds and I told her it was because \"I disturb you when you sleep and you don't get a good night's rest when you're sleeping near me. It'd be best if we had our own rooms and I can also have an office\". She immediately tensed up (that's how I know she's angry) and said \"so you don't want to sleep next to me anymore? what else is going on?\" which turned into a long argument.\n\nI thought i was helping her. I know she's tired of me and I'm also tired of hearing her complain about me in the mornings. It's just for a few hours. We'll both be knocked out anyway.\n\nTL;DR my girlfriend hates that I snore so I suggested separate bedrooms and she's now angry with me.... again.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

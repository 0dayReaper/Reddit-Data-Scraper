And some people are more comfortable being assholes then others so it sounds like everyone came out happy AND comfortable in this situation, which is what matters.\n\nOP gets to be a happy AH in her big bed while also being told she's not an AH by her partner and the other couple that agree with her. \n\nLauren gets to be a happy AH and sleep in her own bed, even while all her friends think she's an AH\n\nEDIT: to add, I only brought up comfort bc you are the one prioritizing comfort in your other arguments rgd your owned perception that bunkbeds are inherently uncomfortable, even while OP notes the bunk beds were comfortable queen mattresses, not  singles. I would argue that non of this has anything to do with comfort but common courtesy. Regardless, I'll see you at the next march for the rights of single people everywhere",

You were the last to arrive because you actually picked up lunch for everyone, so she\u2019s kind of crappy for the \u2018losers weepers\u2019 attitude.   Your edit erroneously and needlessly (from your comments) indicated you paid for the Airbnb like a treat for everyone. That\u2019s inaccurate. You paid the lodging and it was going to even out to costs as everyone else was covering other expenses",

Be glad you're rid of Lauren.\n\nI get what other people are saying, but you should have never been relegated to last choice even if you figured the math for alcohol and groceries as roughly even. If you were stopping to get lunch for everyone, your friends should have either waited to pick rooms until you arrived or reserved the \"master\" bedroom for you and been willing to switch when you arrived. \n\nAlso, it's not really discrimination. A location was chosen with one room with bunk beds as an accommodation for the two singles on the trip because it was assumed the couples would want to share beds and the singles would not want to share a bed. And the beds were mentioned before the trip. If they objected to bunk beds, they should have asked for a different location that had 4 king beds or whatever. Did Lauren really think OP wanted to sleep with Alex in separate bunk beds?",

There are 8 of us on this trip. \n\nMe and my boyfriend \u201cAlex\u201d,\n\u201cKate\u201d and her boyfriend \u201cJames\u201d \n\u201cAlyssa\u201d and her boyfriend \u201cThomas\u201d\n \nAnd two of our single friends \u201cLauren\u201d and \u201cSimon\u201d \n\nThe lakehouse has 4 bedrooms. Bedrooms #1, 2 and 3 have king beds and bedroom 4 has a bunkbed. We specifically got this airbnb because it made sense that the couples would sleep on the king beds and the two singles would get the bunkbed. \n\nEveryone drove up to the airbnb this morning. Me and my boyfriend were the last ones that got there because we stopped to get everybody some lunch. By the time we got there everyone had picked their rooms and unloaded their bags. The last room left was the bunkbed room. \n\nI stepped out into the living room where everyone was and asked why Lauren and Simon weren\u2019t sleeping in the bunkbed room. Lauren said \u201cthe king bed was more comfortable, me and simon don\u2019t wanna sleep on the bunkbed\u201d \n\nI said \u201cthat\u2019s not really fair, the other couples all get a king bed, the bunkbed was specifically for you guys. So please just move your stuff.\u201d \n\nLauren then said \u201cNo, we got here first so we got dibs.\u201d \n\nI then said \u201ceither you guys move into the bunkbed room or you guys can leave. Me and Alex are the ones that paid for the airbnb so at the end of the day, what we say goes.\u201d\n\nLauren then got all mad, grabbed her stuff and left. Simon got up and said it wasn\u2019t a problem that he\u2019d move into the bunkbed room. \n\nI got a text from Lauren just now saying that I was being a bitch over a literal bunkbed. All of our other friends are on our side about this but idk am I the AH? I didn\u2019t mean to make Lauren upset but she was being so difficult.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You just happened to be the one who put the card down for the AirBnb, but we're otherwise an equal contributor. It would be the equivalent of having to eat scraps because you didn't pay for the food.\n\nFurther, you went straight after the singles, while the couples were in the same position than Lauren and Simon. You just assumed that since they were single, they would have to bunk. Why, if they contributed equally, should they have to? What makes couples so special that they need a king size instead of 2 bunk beds?\n\nAnd above all, you phrased this as if you were being taken advantage of. You sound like a bully, and Lauren probably left not because of this one incident, but because of this being the cherry on the top.",

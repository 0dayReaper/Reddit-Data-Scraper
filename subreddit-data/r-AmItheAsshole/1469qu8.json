But if you casually brought it up as something you're considering then that's okay. \n\nAlthough, I DO I have side with her a little bit. She is right that the world is dangerous and that the chances of being harmed increase if you're in a strange place. Criminals like to take advantage of lost people by appearing kind and friendly. It happens. But, does that mean you should never travel and see places? Absolutely not. Are you too young to do it alone? Not necessarily, but your lack of life experience will probably make it difficult for you, especially if this is going to be the first time you have ever left the country. I suggest you take it slow, and maybe take small steps, such as first traveling to another major city that is hours away. Then go further, and further, until you've gained your mom's trust AND have also gained some experience with not only traveling, but also with interacting with strangers in new places. Then, you might consider leaving the country. When I first left my home for another country, I actually did it through a scholarship program at my school for some study/work abroad thing for 6 months. We were in a group and led by an experienced person. This helped to ease a lot of people's minds, including my own. I was also not 18, I was 24, and honestly when I look back at that, I feel like I was too young, because I actually did struggle, especially with the culture shock. \n\nSo, that was a long winded way to say, no you're not NTA, but your mom has some points and I think if you approach the next Convo you have with her about this with a better plan, she wouldn't be so scared to see you go ;)",

My friend was so traumatized he got a blackbelt.  My advice to you is go with a group.  Not a small group.  Get the hang of it. Research customs and norms before you go in your group.  And have a great time.  In my experience it can be so fun.  Istanbul is amazing if you want a suggestion.  Not alone.  Don't wear skimpy clothing.  Don't drink. Be big. Be responsible.

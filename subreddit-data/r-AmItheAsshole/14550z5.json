    "postText": "Me and 2 of my school friends got tickets to a show near where I live - I live in a big city about 5 hours from where we grew up, they both live in our hometown. I invited them to stay with me after the show for the weekend. \nOne friend messaged me and asked if 2 of her friends from another group could also stay in my house as they had got last minute tickets to the same show but had nowhere to stay in the city. \nI said no because 1. I have 4 other housemates and live in a small house. I rent a room not the whole house. I\u2019m not particularly close with my housemates but respect them and their space so i don\u2019t want to irritate anyone I live with. 2. I don\u2019t know these girls that well and any interactions I\u2019ve had with them in the past they\u2019ve been quiet rude so I don\u2019t really want to spend a weekend with them. 3. I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s my responsibility that they didn\u2019t arrange accommodation before they got their tickets. \nMy friend is pissed because she said they have no other options for getting to the show. I feel guilty that they\u2019re gonna miss out but am annoyed that the blame is put on me.",

Be prepared for them all to show up. Perhaps have a discussion with your housemates (sounds like you have a reasonable relationship with them) about the problem. Tell them that if three girls turn up claiming they\u2019re staying, that the answer is no, and not to let them in. I think you\u2019ll be surprised at how readily your housemates will back you, especially considering that you\u2019re being respectful of their space.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMe and 2 of my school friends got tickets to a show near where I live - I live in a big city about 5 hours from where we grew up, they both live in our hometown. I invited them to stay with me after the show for the weekend. \nOne friend messaged me and asked if 2 of her friends from another group could also stay in my house as they had got last minute tickets to the same show but had nowhere to stay in the city. \nI said no because 1. I have 4 other housemates and live in a small house. I rent a room not the whole house. I\u2019m not particularly close with my housemates but respect them and their space so i don\u2019t want to irritate anyone I live with. 2. I don\u2019t know these girls that well and any interactions I\u2019ve had with them in the past they\u2019ve been quiet rude so I don\u2019t really want to spend a weekend with them. 3. I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s my responsibility that they didn\u2019t arrange accommodation before they got their tickets. \nMy friend is pissed because she said they have no other options for getting to the show. I feel guilty that they\u2019re gonna miss out but am annoyed that the blame is put on me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

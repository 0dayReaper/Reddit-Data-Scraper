Children are more observant than we give them credit for.\n\nThat your daughter defended you right away pretty much makes it impossible to consider you an asshole.\n\nLooking at it from a pure logic standpoint, isn't it better they learn not to expect anything from their mom early in life?\n\nCertainly, you shouldn't have lost your temper in front of children, but no one is perfect, especially when someone is calling you perverted for being a great single dad.\n\nYou also had no idea they were there listening so closely.\n\nHonestly you are way too hard on yourself to even think you needed to post here.\n\nKeep on being a great dad xD",

The younger two just say they wish their mom would come back and we could all be a family again. It's killing me.",

I wasn\u2019t comfortable talking with my dad OR my mom when I got my period. The fact that he not only recognized the situation, but then went on to comfort and then support her to the best of his capabilities? That\u2019s what kids like her need. \n\nNothing is ever perfect, and the family dynamic my be disrupted, but the kind of support OP is delivering deserves so much respect. He came through for his kiddo, and if his ex wants to be mad about it that\u2019s her problem.",

I\u2019m 27 and my dad still flips out if he even sees an unopened box of tampons in a grocery bag. He will still get onto me if I don\u2019t bury a tampon wrapper under toilet paper in the trash can (not a tampon\u2014just the wrapper) because he \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to see that stuff\u201d. He got mad when I tried to keep a cute basket of tampons on the back of the toilet in high school and made me keep them in the cabinet on the other side of the room. Wasn\u2019t even his bathroom! I know he was just brought up that way, to view periods and bras etc. as embarrassing, but it was really hard on me as a young girl already struggling with body image and puberty. My mom sort of reinforced the sense of taboo and it really caused me to develop a lot of shame centered around my body and bodily functions. Their weird attitudes especially sucked because I had severely abnormal periods but it took years to convince them that it was serious and get medical help for it because it felt like it wasn\u2019t okay to even bring the topic up. Anyway I suppose that was an unsolicited tangent but I am just so so so grateful that dads like this exist. OP, you are doing a fantastic job and setting your daughters up for a healthy, positive body image. Keep up the great work.",

I admire that about her in a way, but I\u2019m in a weird position- I\u2019ve been out with her coworkers, and they absolutely do speak to her like she\u2019s an idiot. They treat her like a sexy moron- shouting her down, her lovely mates grab at her when she\u2019s drunk, brush past the awards she\u2019s won to brag about their own achievements. \n\nI adore her, but she wants to be a Cool Girl more than she\u2019d ever want to complain about how she\u2019s treated. I have other girlfriends in STEM fields who rail ferociously against bro culture, but my field is law so I can\u2019t argue with her from personal experience. She instantly dismisses anyone else\u2019s account of ill treatment as their being weak.\n\nHave you encountered anyone like this? Is there any argument or data I can put forward that will convince her that women really are poorly treated in her industry? I\u2019ve considered the idea that she needs to believe this to cover for her own poor treatment, but she\u2019s been this way before she even began studying. Sorry for dumping this on you- I\u2019m planning on asking the question in a more appropriate subreddit. I just thought you might have some experience with this. Feel free to ignore me if this is too much, like I said I\u2019ll be asking elsewhere soon.",

When I was younger I thought it was fun to be \u201cone of the guys\u201d (I\u2019m in my early 30\u2019s now for reference) and we were all just ragging on each other. It took accidentally finding out a less senior man in the company was making more than me, despite my accomplishments for the company and education, for it to all click. \n\nI moved on to a well-known global tech company that prides itself on inclusivity after that. My male coworkers and superiors still treated me as less than but in a more subtle way. But I learned how to advocate for myself and formed relationships with other women in the company where we all supported each other (something harder to do when you\u2019re one of the guys). \n\nInstead of trying to point out their behavior, maybe you could try encouraging and building her up especially in front of them. If they try to belittle the accomplishment then you could use their own tactic against them. Like if she got an award and they\u2019re saying it\u2019s no big deal then you could come back with \u201cand how many of these awards do you have?\u201d Obviously you\u2019ve gotta know something about the guys to pull it off, but if it\u2019s a comeback in the same tone as they use with each other it goes over as a joke while planting the idea in her head that she\u2019s accomplished more than they have.",

Even if the youngest two don't entirely get it yet, they will. \n\nAnd the period thing? Man, you rock! It sounds like you did a fantastic job of explaining periods and making your oldest feel comfortable, so much so that she actively wanted to be involved in educating the other two. In doing so, your younger two got to see that the family is united, periods aren't scary or something to be ashamed of, and you all were able to bond in yet another way. 10/10 job, perfectly done, absolutely no need for mom or other relatives to be involved. Your ex is disgusting for implying that you cannot speak to your own daughters about periods. I wouldn't want her to be educating girls at all.\n\nShe is also the worst mom for taking great delight in knowing your kids are watching you argue and using their potential distress as a weapon against you. She literally proved she cares more about scoring points against you then she does about her daughters' feelings.\n\nEdited to add, in case it isn't clear enough already, NTA NTA NTA!",

So rather than living with her and Dad having visitation every other weekend/holiday, I lived with Dad and she had the same visitation schedule. A couple of years after that, when I decided that I couldn't handle seeing her as often as her visitation scheduled allowed, I had to have a couple of sessions with a psychologist so that they could basically recommend/approve that visitation be stopped and amended to me seeing my mother when I wanted to. I am unsure if this would have been a possibility earlier, maybe it's something for OP to look into? \n\nOP's ex sounds just like my mother, in that almost every interaction with me was calculated to cause maximum hurt to Dad, and I can tell you from experience that being used as a tool like that is certainly hurting your kids, even if they don't yet realize it.",

But courts &amp; other adults don't take kids seriously until they are older. It might be easier to wait a bit so the kids testimony carries more weight. Also OP should look into if it's a one-Party-consent state.  If so it might be time to record those calls if OPs mother is this vindictive verbally.",

You did an amazing job explaining periods. Why don't you sit down with them and ask what they feel? Tell them you want them to be honest with you, that you will never judge them for that. That you only want to understand what they think and what they feel so that you can learn with them and from them. Parents can't read minds, after all. No one can. And their answers may give you a lot to think about. Even the younger one, even if she can't express herself that well, will try to give you something.\nTry to have a really open relationship with them based on trust and honesty. They will certainly remember that for life and they will value your presence.\n\nBelieve me. As someone whose dad walked out (and he never looked back and won't ever do so because the woman he's with forbade him. Not like he would. He doesn't feel anything for us anymore and I'm doubting he ever did), I really wished you were my dad. You were so cool!\n\nEdit: typo",

One night I saw him on the phone outside leaving her voicemails to come home and he sat down and started to cry. I came out and held him and hugged him and that day, it made me really see that men can hurt and that he has done everything he could for my siblings and I. Now I see him as a human, I saw his anger and I wasn\u2019t mad about that, I was hurt because I saw how much he hurt and now growing up, I realize that society has taught us that men don\u2019t hurt and cry, but because of that night I always make sure my boyfriends are ok and if they\u2019re hurt, it\u2019s ok to cry. Talk about your feeling a bit, that you didn\u2019t like how it felt to yell but sometimes you can\u2019t control it. It\u2019s a form of hurt and everyone feels hurt sometimes but that also means you have room to feel loved. I can guarantee your girl will always feel ok to tell you and each other when they hurt too. Hug them again after you read this (if you do)",

Secondly, you\u2019re an AMAZING father.\n\nAs the only daughter of a divorce with a deadbeat mom (who had custody until I chose where I could live) and my dad who fought tooth and nail to get me and give me a safe space to live, your daughters see you as their hero, I almost guarantee it. I know my situation isn\u2019t the exact same, and everyone is different, but believe you me, your daughters ABSOLUTELY still love you, *even if the yelling may have scared them because it was unusual*.\n\nAlso, I will warn you that their desire for \u201cthe family to come back together\u201d may never go away. I got an amazing stepmom and have grown up to now being 28 and pretty emotionally okay, but there\u2019s still a tiny part of me that wishes my biomom and dad could get back together so my life could be normal again. It\u2019s hard, it\u2019s hard on the girls and it\u2019s hard on you. Get them therapy if you can, or at least continue being as open and supportive as possible. Teenage girls are no joke and I was a complete ahole to my stepmom out of resentment for things my biomom (didn\u2019t) do, even though my stepmom did them (like buying clothes, teaching me about my female body, etc.) so... yeah. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this but keep at it. And don\u2019t worry about staying strong, just stay *real*. Your children will always love you, just like they\u2019ll probably always love their mom, no matter how terrible she may be.\n\nI wish you the best and feel free to DM me if you need to chat more. \n\nAnd obligatory- NTA at all.",

Ok, you should maybe have stopped the conversation when you found it getting out of hand, but she knew exactly what she was doing-she saw the kids behind you and didn't warn you, deliberately, so she is equally responsible for exposing them to the shouting. She sounds like a terrible mother and you sound like a great dad. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a dad talking to daughters about their body, as long as they are comfortable with the conversation. My dear old dad had 3 daughters only a year apart, and we all ended up syncing our periods-he knew exactly what each of us preferred and every month would leave a big bag of sanitary products and chocolate bars in our rooms.",

I had to restock them all the time which means that people coming to my house were using them. They are in their 20s now and have moved out but I still make sure there are pads and tampons in the bathrooms because they come home for visits and have friends that are women visit and they bring girlfriends around.\n\nI started doing this when my oldest was in 4th grade because I didn\u2019t want anyone to be at my house and be too embarrassed to ask for pads.",

My mom already left for work and my older sister was off at college. The only person home was my dad. I went crying into his home office and he was on a phone call. He told whoever he was taking to he had to call them back. He asked me what was wrong and I told him \u201cI think I got my period\u201d. He immediately went into dad mode and showed me where my mom kept all the feminine products. He took to time to help me decide wether I wanted to use a pad or a tampon. He saw how confused I was about a tampon and he helped me get new underwear and showed me how the pad went on. I then went to change and he asked me if I was okay going to school that day. I told him I wanted to take the morning off and go in after lunch. That moment is never forgotten with me of how caring and concerned he was and made sure I was okay.\n\nOP is a great dad and what he did for his daughters to help them will stick with them forever.",

You obviously have a lot on your shoulders, and anyone in your position would need help managing your feelings and stressors. It\u2019s a lot to deal with. \n\nYou love your kids and you did the right thing about the periods. Your ex is an asshole and is behaving very immaturely.

It sounds like when you feel bad about your kids being hurt, you relax all your boundaries and go into treat mode (ice cream and tv). That can be healthy at times, but with so much pain coming from moms side of things, you\u2019ll have to be careful not to overcompensate by being too soft.

I leaked a lot the first 18 months - 2 years and my dad had to help me clean up a lot.

Your ex is a sexist and I am so very happy that your girls have you to counter her ugly, toxic views and inability to parent. Menstruation is not some mysterious feminine voodoo secret that is somehow sullied by male understanding and involvement. It is a simple biological process that occurs in rough half the population. You handled it perfectly with grace, humor and love. Hang in there Papa Bear, they\u2019re little now, but one day they won\u2019t be, and they will continue to need you so much as they come to terms with their mother\u2019s sexism and extreme selfishness and ugliness.\n\nEdit to add: Apologize to your girls. Tell them honestly that you lost your temper, you were wrong for shouting, and that you\u2019re sorry. Its good for kiddos to know that moms and dads make mistakes too, and are willing to admit them and apologize for them. Doing so doesn\u2019t make you an asshole, it makes you human. If they want to continue to discuss the incident to process it, remind them about a time they lost their tempers and shouted at you or a friend or each other and then talk about their feelings during those times, and how yours were similar, and then make a plan together for how you can all react better the next time anyone feels like they\u2019re losing their temper. It will help soothe their worries to know that this is not a big scary unknown, but a specific problem that has a solution they can understand. \n\nIt\u2019s frustrating to have to do that because no doubt you\u2019re seething (I would be) and only sorry that they heard you, not that you yelled at their horrible mother. You\u2019ll be glad you swallowed it though, when your anger subsides and when you\u2019re looking back, years from now, on decades of honest, involved life with your babies while your ex is wondering why her girls never call and don\u2019t care to involve her in their lives.",

It will also set a good example for them that they will be able to also use later on. \n\nOf course, therapy is also helpful, but nothing beats being able to talk freely to your parent (and siblings) about your struggles.",

Good on you for making them feel good about this and helping them navigate it.\n\nSecondly, good on you for calling out your ex. She seems toxic and unsupportive and totally ABSENT as a parent.

You didn't make the kids cry, SHE made them cry by not being there or being a being a decent parent. \n\nDefinitely don't be afraid to call her out on her toxic behavior.

You proved that by going over periods with your daughters and making sure they had all the information and choices.  You arent making anything taboo to speak of and should be commended for it.  If your ex cared, she would have gone over this beforehand.   Your ex has abandoned her children and poonts the finger at anyone except herself.  She pushed your buttons and you had a slip up.  A slip up does not an asshole make.  Especially if you tried to de-escalate and remove them from the situation immediately upon discovering they were there.   It sounds like your daughters love you and you love them.  I am sorry to hear that she does not... especially if her reaction to her daughters overhearing the fight is to blame you and make no concern for them.  That was a despicable thing of her to do.",

Children are not given enough credit for how much they actually understand. \n\nI don't think your children cried because you yelled at your ex, I think they were upset that their Mom would treat you so poorly. Kids idolize their parents. I'd imagine they were sad for you, and sad because their Mom can't seem to be a Mom. \n\nBut on the period issue, you handled it wonderfully. The fact that your ex seems to think that it is a taboo thing to discuss and should only be talked about by women is disgusting. There is nothing \"sick and perverted\" about being a parent to your daughters and teaching them about periods. \n\nYou brought up very VALID things to your ex, about how she is hurting your daughters and really ruining their self esteem. They feel like it is their fault their Mom doesn't love them or support them. \n\nYour ex took the opportunity to bait you by saying very hurtful, inappropriate comments likely KNOWING your daughters were behind you. You reacted, and then she SMIRKED because your kids were crying. She manipulated you and hurt your kids intentionally. \n\nOverall, your ex is sexualizing your daughters for menstruating and making comments about you sexually in front of them. She is also emotionally abusing your children by shattering their self esteem and making them feel that they are unlovable and the reason she left your marriage. She is HURTING them. \n\nI really hope you consider limiting her custody as much as possible, and helping your kids help themselves by attending some counseling to understand the complex emotions they must be feeling.",

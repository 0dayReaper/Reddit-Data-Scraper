    "postText": "Hi folks,\n\nToday, I (19F) declared my intention to my mother that I will be taking an EMT class this summer while I am home (in between my first and second year of college) to help pay for bills during my college education as well as to gain medical experience as someone studying Pre-med/Computer Science.\n\nMy grandmother was recently diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, and has been given a prognosis of 1-2 months (weeks to months) to live. My mother believes that me taking this class would be wrong as I wouldn't be guaranteed to be available when things do decline, and that I wouldn't be available 24/7 to support my mother and family. Also, she believes that I wouldn't be able to get my driver's license and get a medical condition diagnosed while I pursue this class (my other goals for this summer) as I would be too busy, even though I am unemployed.\n\nAdditionally, she reasoned that EMS is highly unsafe, and that I wouldn't be able to handle seeing people in various states of life and death.\n\nI do care deeply about my grandmother, but I also recognize that life has to go on, and I can't pause my career while waiting for her imminent passing.\n\nSo, AITA for sticking to my guns on this and still intending to take this class?",

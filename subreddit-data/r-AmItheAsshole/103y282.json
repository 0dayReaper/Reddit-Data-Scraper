Then they refused to pay for college for me even though my sibs went. When I finally went to college on my own they belittled and tried to sabotage every step I made at improving my life. I haven't spoken to those AH's for 27 years.\n\nETA: Thanks so much for all the kind words. I'm deeply moved, I know I made the right choices for me but there are some people who cannot understand NC-ing the fam. They are just some people that I used to know now.",

What if his brother ends up needing expensive professional care? Is Aiden supposed to just hope the government will support him? Or will a 30+ year old with no job history going to magically get a high-paying job with great insurance to cover his (and his brothers) needs?\n\nEven with the job market being tight, no one will take a chance on an adult with no job history, no sign of being self-sufficient, and no upkeep in skills. It would be immensely difficult to start working life as a very mature adult.\n\nNot only is this abusive, but it's almost criminally stupid in how short-sighted it is. Stand your ground, your husband either doesn't understand he's destroying both his sons lives, or he just doesn't care.",

I graduated into the recession and my parents, who aren't college educated, kept pestering me about why I worked low paying jobs and five days a week. At the time lots of people couldn't get a job at all. My parents felt that a bachelor's degree should let you just walk into a job that pays $200k a year and you only have to work a couple days a week. So maybe the husband thinks Aiden can do that years from now without gaining any other skills or experience. \n\nI recommend OP takes the advice of other posters in this thread - make sure Aiden has his own email address with a password that can't be guessed, and help him get his own checking account. Also, check computers for keyloggers and other spying software so only Aiden knows where he is applying. Everything needs to be separated from the husband. It wouldn't hurt to talk to an industry specific recruiter as well.",

Remember to do the \"sign out of all devices\" on the old account. \n\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n\n\n2. His own bank account that he has SOLE access to withdrawals and management\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n3. Resume/ CV support. Look up some workshops, but it is likely that the \"work gap\" can be \"explained\" on his CV with a nice blurb/ timeline of \"caretaking ill family member\". If his chosen field has any sort of relevant volunteering or internships - get one asap. If not, still, start a volunteer job somewhere. It shows work ethic and experience (and helps gets you past algorithms that mass sort by keywords and work history). \n\n.\n.\n.\n\n\n4. Hard conversations time about long term care planning, substitute decision makers, and power of attorney for your younger son, and you/ your husband. Services vary by area &amp; country for professional support. But, there are some online services you can utilize that are free (example My Voice: Expressing my wishes for future health care), and give you a conversation template. Ideally, you work through this template with a family therapist, social worker, case manager etc. While it is appropriate for family to be involved in and invested in caring for eachother. It is absolutely NOT appropriate for full care responsibilities to be placed on a child (or any person!) non-consensually. Aiden is a person deserving of care, and quality of life, as well. You recognize this. \n\n.\n.\n.\n\nIt sounds like you both care deeply, but your husband has internalized responsibilities and let this overtake his identity and worldview, and has some tunnel vision about caring for younger son? Changing these views can be hard and scary and emotional. But, absolutely necessary to maintain and restore interpersonal dynamics. \n\n5. Consider, and I recognize this is also area/ country/ demographics dependent, if possible - enrollment in a community care &amp;/ or respite care program to increase supports for your younger son now. Respite will give you one off hours/ days/ weekends. Community care can be up to multiple times daily. Depending on needs (and area), there are also peds (and adult as he ages) day programs for profoundly disabled kids- these give the kids a change of scenery and the parents a break. They also often come with associated family therapy &amp; support programs. Apologies if this point is all old hat info as you have been living with and navigating your situation for years! \n\n6. Be gentle with yourself and proud of your decision. You advocated for your son. You are an excellent parent\n\n\nEdit: formatting in mobile",

Husband probably twisted it to his own advantage and then went NC. This poor kid, Aiden. He deserves a way more functional family than this.

Could there be some early dementia happening here, or perhaps a mental health crisis brought on by the stress of caring for your other son and your own health issues?

Check with your state to see what assistance your son is qualified for. Maybe even putting his name on a list for assisted living facilities. These homes can take years on the waiting list for a spot to become available so adding his name now will benefit you in the future.",

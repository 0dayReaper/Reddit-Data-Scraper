    "postText": "I (M16) live with my mother and have for the past 2 years. My mother cares about family dearly and if anyone needs a home to stay in she let's them stay. About 4 months ago my aunt had left her mother's home and needed a place to live, so my mother let her stay here until she got a job and could move out. The first few weeks were fine, I didn't grow up around her so it took time for me to get use to her. There aren't any major problems in my opinion, but to my step dad there are. My aunt has a habit were she never cleans after herself or help with chores unless she is told to, not asked but TOLD to. He's also annoyed that she is living here and still doesn't have a job. She also talks to us all as if we are stupid (I believe she has a masters in math?) And is always giving everyone an attitude when we try to talk to her. Recently her GF (us kids call her our aunt but for the sake of this, we'll call her Lucy, NOT HER REAL NAME BTW) moved in because of the bill passed in Florida that made it where she can't get her HRT. Anyways, I was out of state for 6 days visiting family with a friend and came back with a better view on how people should treat me. I had to do 2 trips to the car to get my things (I overpack) and had left the door open since I'd be running back out to the car. As I'm walking out of my room my aunt says in a angry and rude tone \"Who left the door wide open?\" I responded saying I had left it open bc I was getting my things from the car and she gave me a nasty look for. About an hour after I got home and I had settled in I came back out of my room and saw her messing with our fish tank. She had made some makeshift filter for the tank (we have a filter) and she had clean the tank. She left the fish in the tank as she added new water into the tank (not having treated the water yet) I asked her why she did this and she said it was fine as long as the water was the same temp as the water in the tank. I told her that I was told to always take them out the tank and to treat the water and she talked to me as if I was dumb. I called her out on it and said I didn't appreciate her talking down to me since there's a chance we were taught different things about fish (I had my own pet fish before moving) and I wasn't trying to correct but tell her what I knew. She snapped at me and said that I've been giving her an attitude ever since I got home. I rolled my eyes (I probably shouldn't have) and walked off. I heard her complaining to my mother a few minutes after it happened about my attitude and I don't think my mother really cared I did it since she's always giving everyone else one.\n\nI don't think I gave her any attitude but AITA if I did?",

Yes, temperatures should match, sudden fluctuations are huge stressors to fish. But that isn\u2019t why you pull them and treat water.\n\nIf your water comes from public water and not a well, it is likely being treated. One of those treatments is a low dose of chlorine to kill bacteria. Doesn\u2019t really harm us, but it will potentially do a number to fish gills. The treatment you refer is most often used to neutralizes the chlorine. \n\nNow, if you have a well, unless you have a really funky water filter inside your home, not likely any chlorine, and can not treat. Likewise, topping off a tank due to evaporation doesn\u2019t typically introduce enough either - it\u2019s those big clean and change 30% ones you treat.\n\nThought you might want to know where that comes from!\n\nNTA",

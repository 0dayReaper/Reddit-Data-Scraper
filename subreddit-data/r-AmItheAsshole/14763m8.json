I didn't give my brother my 2000\u20ac savings for his party even tho he tried helping us as much as he could when we needed money\n\n2.

Did you guys give your brother his money back when he helped you or is any help given intended to be a gift?  \nGiven the way you describe your brother I would not trust him to be able to pay back any money, not \u20ac400 and certainly not 2000! Also a driver's license is far more important than a party.",

He is kind of a weird guy.\nHe always jumps from job to job and throws money around a lot.\nBut other than that he really is a nice guy and often comes over to spend time with us.\nThis month however he, for reasons i'm not aware of, only got ~20% of his last paycheck and because of this can't throw around his money.\nBut me and mom calculated, that he could still have 10\u20ac a day.\nShould be enough to keep up untill next payday comes around right?\nWell i guess not because today after coming over he came to me and we talked about money a lot.\nHe seemed to have spent all he got already and won't have enough for the rest of the month.\nNot only that but his birthday is due next week and he wants to invite a lot of people for a party.\nI told him that mom cant give him money but i could give him some.\nHe that startet asking me about my savings because he knows that i save as much as possible.\nI tell him that currently i have 2000\u20ac in my box and because he needs it i offer him to give him 400\u20ac for the rest of the month.\nOut of nowhere he starts to get confused somehow and questions me about where i got so much money.\nI told him how i save my money every month.\nBig mistake i think.\nHe starts demanding i need to give him my entire savings so he doesn't have to cancle the party he planned.\nAfter telling him that i would in no way ever give him my entire savings he really got mad ad me and said a lot of stuff about how much of a unhelpfull brother i am and that he will remember this if i ever need something.\nI still gave him the 400\u20ac anyway because starving doesn't sound very fun.\nBut i really made sure that if he can't keep up this month then it is not my problem anymore.\nHe left not long after as well.\nNow I don't know how i should feel about this.\nThe thing is that he as well helped us out with money when the money was to little to handle and maybe i were a bit selfish about it.\nHis girlfriend and all his friends wanted to throw a big party and i just broke this plan in half.\nOn the other hand i must say that i really need a drivers license to not be late to work in the future because my bus didn't show yp in time.\nComing late during a training is a big nono in my company.\nSo long story short AITA fot this?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

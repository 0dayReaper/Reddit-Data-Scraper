    "postText": "I, (M19), am in my home city for the summer. For context, I moved away for high school, so I left 5 years ago, and because of COVID, haven't visited in 3 years. My \"good\" friend from that home city, \"Xavier\", also (M19), is also here. We've regularly kept in contact during these 5 years, and he's visited my college dorm this year, as well as stayed a week at my house during winter break. \n\nI've been pretty excited to see my friends this summer, and one of the things we planned to do is play basketball. However, today, I learned that this particular friend wanted to play basketball with two other friends, \"Adrian &amp; Brian\", and not me. His reasoning being that I'm not that close with Adrian, (we haven't talked since middle school), and I don't know Brian because he only came in highschool, when I was gone. Xavier thinks it'd be awkward, so isn't inviting me.\n\nI'm feeling pretty upset about this. Xavier is leaving soon but coming back in July, so this would be the last time until July where I play basketball with him. I was expecting to play basketball with him a lot, so it's pretty disappointing. I may still see Xavier in the next week, but I only found out about this when we were making plans to hangout. \n\nI agree that it would be kinda awkward at first, for the aforementioned reasons, but I don't think that's enough reasoning to exclude me. Honestly, I feel like basketball is the perfect activity to meet new people. During winter break, when Xavier stayed at my house, we played basketball, and we played with my other highschool friends that were also strangers to Xavier at first. If they were going out to eat, I'd understand because we'd have to talk the whole time. This actually happened as well: I made plans to hangout the day I got back, but Xavier cancelled to see some friends I didn't know, because he wouldn't get the chance to see again, which I understood. But this time, I don't.\n\nXavier and I are pretty close friends, so I'm feeling pretty upset about this. I don't understand, will I just never meet his high school friends? It's not even like there's no spots left, it's pickup basketball, which I presume will be 5v5, not 3v5.\n\nAITA for feeling like I should be invited to play basketball and meet mutual friends?",

I\u2019m sensing - and it seems you are too - that there are reasons he isn\u2019t telling you for not inviting you along. Maybe you have grown apart, maybe you all have clashing personalities, maybe he wants to be seen as \u201ccool\u201d with these other guys. Either way, his behaviour towards you is unacceptable. \n\nPeople grow apart. It can be hard to let them go, but there are other friends out there who will appreciate you for being you.",

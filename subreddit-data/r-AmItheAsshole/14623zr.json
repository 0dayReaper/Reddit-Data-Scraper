    "postText": "On mobile so forgive formatting. \n\nI need to know if I\u2019m being unreasonable. My bf (27M) has gone away on a stag do with 27 other lads. I was totally fine with this no issue. Before he left I sat him down and told him my expectations for keeping in contact. I said don\u2019t worry about texting me all day etc go have fun but the one thing I need you to do is text me when you get back to the hotel at night so I know your safe or I\u2019ll be up all night worrying. First night - no text!! I was up until 3am then kept waking up to see if he\u2019d text me which he hadn\u2019t. He\u2019s also turned his location off. He called at 12:45pm the next day and said it was a heavy one and he didn\u2019t get in until 7am - I said great glad you had a good night but it takes two seconds to text me. He immediately said \u2018oh I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re kicking off about this\u2019 so I said well it\u2019s the one thing I told you I needed you to do, the one thing I asked and you couldn\u2019t even do it on the first night. We had a bit of back and forth then I put the phone down on him because I wasn\u2019t saying it to argue I was trying to communicate my feelings which he immediately dismissed. I didn\u2019t mention his location being off - I forgot. It\u2019s just frustrating as I\u2019ve asked for *one* thing and he\u2019s ignored my request. Side note - one of the other lads was posting on fb all night that they were partying and seshing with a group of girls all night\n\nWhere I might be the AH - he\u2019s on holiday and maybe I should just leave him to it?",

In this instance, it makes YTA.  \n\nI have anxiety, and it caused havoc in my last relationship where he needed to check in with me every night he wasn't home.  Our relationship didn't survive,  and while that wasn't the main cause of its demise, it was certainly a contributing factor.  Medication has helped, but so has working on my communication and boundaries.\n\nYou need to step back and think if you can trust him, and also communicate clearly to him how you feel, including about the location tracking being turned off.  You also need to listen to him and respect his response.  Even if it means being essentially incompatible.  \n\nGood luck",

I\u2019d gone in to a bit of a spiral and kinda erupted at him when we spoke. I thought we\u2019d agreed he would text me when he got back to the hotel but as others have said when he said oh I might be really drunk and not text you that was him saying he doesn\u2019t agree to my request. \n\nI do genuinely trust him it\u2019s just not a great feeling knowing he\u2019s partying with a group of girls but not texting me back however I think it was his first night and he got giddy and got mega drunk and just forgot to text. When he comes home I think I will have a chat with him and explain how it made me feel including the turning off the location, but I\u2019m not doing that whilst he\u2019s away, and listen to what he says back - key word *listen* lol. P.s I\u2019m currently coming off mood stabilisers so I think that might have played a part in my anxious spiral",

But he agreed so that's on him. \n\nHowever his trip isn't the right time to have a back and forth. He told you why he didn't text you. Atp you should have simply asked him to be more cognizant next time, per your agreement. \n\nWhat you did was chastise him. Not share your feelings. Feelings are \"i feel a bit disregarded because xyz\". \n\nThere are people saying he dismissed your feelings but he actually dismissed your passive aggressive attempt at accountability. So to him it was a \"kickoff\". \n\nThe reason I gave you nta is because how and when we communicate is a skill we all have to learn over time and you will get there. \n\nThe other reason I gave you that vote is because I don't like that he turned off his location. It's very weird to me.\n\nEdit:  yta. Below you state he countered your request with the very real possibility he might be drunk and you basically said too bad it's what I want. You did this to yourself. Stop messing up his trip and let him check in when he wants which may be never given your behavior.",

My bf (27M) has gone away on a stag do with 27 other lads. I was totally fine with this no issue. Before he left I sat him down and told him my expectations for keeping in contact. I said don\u2019t worry about texting me all day etc go have fun but the one thing I need you to do is text me when you get back to the hotel at night so I know your safe or I\u2019ll be up all night worrying. First night - no text!! I was up until 3am then kept waking up to see if he\u2019d text me which he hadn\u2019t. He\u2019s also turned his location off. He called at 12:45pm the next day and said it was a heavy one and he didn\u2019t get in until 7am - I said great glad you had a good night but it takes two seconds to text me. He immediately said \u2018oh I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re kicking off about this\u2019 so I said well it\u2019s the one thing I told you I needed you to do, the one thing I asked and you couldn\u2019t even do it on the first night. We had a bit of back and forth then I put the phone down on him because I wasn\u2019t saying it to argue I was trying to communicate my feelings which he immediately dismissed. I didn\u2019t mention his location being off - I forgot. It\u2019s just frustrating as I\u2019ve asked for *one* thing and he\u2019s ignored my request. Side note - one of the other lads was posting on fb all night that they were partying and seshing with a group of girls all night\n\nWhere I might be the AH - he\u2019s on holiday and maybe I should just leave him to it?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He\u2019s on vacation with a bunch of (presumably) his closest friends, and it\u2019s a vacation geared towards going out until the wee hours of the night and getting hammered. \n\nUnless you have an actual reason to be worried about his safety, this is coming off as controlling.",

Did you text him?  Or just get more and more mad that he hadn\u2019t texted you?\n\nIt\u2019s very controlling and inappropriate to make him share his location with you.  Having so much anxiety about his safety is not normal.  Unless he is somewhere like climbing Mt. Everest or in a war zone, you should be able to make it one night without thinking he is dead or something.  If he\u2019s going to cheat on you he will do it whether in his room or not, so it does you not good to know exactly where he is.  \n\nYou will have a much healthier relationship if you aren\u2019t constantly keeping tabs on him.",

In my head I was trying not to be that controlling girlfriend by not texting him and waiting for him to text me but me getting madder and madder has essentially erupted in to me becoming that controlling girlfriend that I didn\u2019t want to be. \n\nWe\u2019ve always shared our location that was never a controlling kinda thing, and it\u2019s never been a control thing that was genuinely for safety. \n\nI also highly doubt he\u2019s going to cheat on me so it\u2019s not that that\u2019s causing my anxiety. It\u2019s just not a nice feeling knowing your bf is partying with a group of girls and not taking two seconds to drop you a text. \n\nNoted to leave him alone and let him enjoy his holiday! Thanks for your perspective",

You can't realistically do anything if he doesn't text you - you're not going to hop on a plane and go see him, and you're not going to call the police and report him missing.\n\nYou don't need this, so don't ask for it.",

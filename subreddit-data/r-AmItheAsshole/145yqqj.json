    "postText": "I (m22) and my gf (21) lost our cat back in March of 2023. It was difficult for both of us. \r  \n\r  \nFor some backstory, I got my cat in college as a companion while I was alone in my college apartment. From the very beginning, he was full of personality and unique in every way, down to the way he held his tail. \r  \n\r  \nCovid hit and I went home to live with my family. In November of 2020 I started talking to my current gf. My cat always stayed with my family since that was the best place for him at the time and I didn\u2019t want to take him elsewhere unless I lived there permanently. Because of that reason, to my gf, he never really seemed like he was mine.\r  \n\r  \nThen, just over a year ago, we moved into an apartment and shortly after we moved him in.\r  \n\r  \nThis is where it started. He was so lovey that he demanded it. We tried letting him sleep with us, but he\u2019d wake us up looking for cuddles. So he had to stay out at night. My gf would complain of cat hair in the bed where we always were. He would also scream for attention constantly. It was cute, but also incredibly annoying even for me, but I always gave in. My gf would complain about him screaming almost as much as he meows for attention. She\u2019d make comments about if she made that much noise she\u2019d wondered if she\u2019d get the attention he does. All he ever wanted was love. She\u2019d also complain about him doing cat stuff. She suggested I trained him. He was our cat right up until it was time for medication or discipline, then he was all mine.\r  \n\r  \nOver the course of the 7 ish months we had him at our place, the complaining never stopped. It made me feel like she didn\u2019t love him, let alone nearly as much as I did. It would start fights too. I offered to take him back to my parents, to which she would say \u201cbut you love him.\u201d It was like this almost every week.\r  \n\r  \nEvery now and again she\u2019d cuddle him when I wasn\u2019t home or when I\u2019d play video games. She\u2019d make sure he\u2019d be okay when we left or when we had to bring him somewhere. She checked on him when I couldn\u2019t. She did love him, just in her own way.\r  \n\r  \nSome time has passed and we\u2019ve talked about her actions and how she felt. We\u2019ve also discussed getting another kitten but only if it needed a home. We came to an agreement about it and that my cat\u2019s passing didn\u2019t deter me from it.\r  \n\r  \nLast night we had another discussion about getting a kitten. Where I may be the ahole is that I didn\u2019t hold back. I told her that I didn\u2019t know she loved him until after he died. I told her that her complaints about how annoying he was shadowed any love she showed to him. She\u2019s even thoroughly expressed how much she disliked untrained animals, bratty children, and rude adults. This only proved my point more and I said that too. After some silence, she asked me to leave the room. It was clear she wanted to be alone. She cried for two hours and then some more this morning before she left for work. Now she doesn\u2019t want a cat, and I feel like an ahole.",

It's more than reasonable that you gf would bexpect  YOU to undo what YOU encouraged.\nI love cats, but if my cats had a behavior that could be desired as screaming, that would not work for me.\nImagine this scenario: Your gf had a toddler from a previous relationship that you adopted (so now it's both of yours!). But the child has developed the habit of screaming when you don't give it what it wants fast enough. Gf gives in every time. She expects you to retran child since the behavior doesn't bother her, she thinks it's cute.",

It originally was a tough call between Y and N A H, because I love cats too and tend to lean in that direction, but then I got to the second half where you\u2019re making judgment calls over what she feels and that for sure makes YTA. \n\nI\u2019m also a big cat lover, so I understand where you\u2019re coming from. From your title I thought there was going to be actual mistreatment. But she just complained about how attention seeking he was, which is understandable too. It can be frustrating to see someone doing something that you believe is contributing to an animals poor behavior. You can love something and not love their behavior. \n\nYou admit that she loved him in her own way, and everyone shows their love differently. And guess what? It\u2019s okay for her to not love the cat with the same fervor and intensity as you. It\u2019s okay for her to show love and affection in a different way from you. Its *okay* for someone to love in a different way from you. She\u2019s not an AH for disliking when owners don\u2019t train their pets properly or when parents don\u2019t discipline their children - that\u2019s a *normal* thing to dislike. Part of pet ownership is taking responsibility for your animals behavior. Don\u2019t you get that the complaining never stopped because the Baha\u2019i or never stopped? Complaining about your cats behavior isn\u2019t her not loving the cat, it\u2019s her not loving how you refuse to take responsibility for it\u2019s behavior. \n\nFor *some reason* you took a discussion about getting a new kitten and turned it into and opportunity to berate her and tell her that she didn\u2019t even love the cat, and that any love she had was overshadowed by her *being annoyed* by your outright refusal to train your cat - and before anyone is all \u201cwell you just can\u2019t train a cat, they do what they want\u201d, I worked at a cat rescue for years and yes, you absolutely can, it may not look like dog training but cats respond very well to positive reinforcement, and you admit that you positively reinforced a lot of bad habits. You saw an annoying habit as a lovable personality quirk and actively fed into it. \n\nYou\u2019re not an AH for loving your cat, but you are an AH for actively ignoring your girlfriends valid complaints, and then using those valid complaints + your refusal as a pet owner to manage those behaviors as ammunition against her to *tell her she didn\u2019t feel love* for that cat and to berate her. She\u2019s definitely thinking about her future right now and whether or not she wants to be attacked and berated and gaslit about her feelings.",

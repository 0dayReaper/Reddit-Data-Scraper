    "postText": "Right, let's start...\r  \n\r  \n\rMost of the extended family still lives in my parent's house which they got from our Polish-American Grandfather including my younger brother, I am in fact one of the few members of the extended family to have moved out (I moved out when I got married) and I have always said I would never want to return to my parent's house ever since I do not have a great relationship with my mother.   \n\n\nA week ago she told me that she wants me to move back in because the rest of the family still live in their house and I needed to obey her because she still believes that I am too young to even have my own house and that I am childish for raising an \"entitled\" trans daughter (my younger brother   \nleaked my daughter's trans info to the whole extended family).   \nI told her over text messages that I never wanted to move back with her and I was 36 years old and she was the one that was entitled to ask me to move back in without ever asking about my wife's or daughter's feelings. She then told me I was an ungrateful child need less to say. It's gonna easily worsen our relationship.  \n\n\r  \nIs she correct that I am entitled and ungrateful? or is she the one that is entitled? She has given me an ultimatum of two weeks to move back with her.",

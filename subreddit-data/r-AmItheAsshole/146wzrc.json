    "postText": "Throwaway since there's some information that would make it clear who I am to anyone who knows me.  \n\nFriday night, my husband (28M) and I (26F) went to a nice dinner hosted by my husband\u2019s company. The dinner was mainly to celebrate the great year he and his team had, so he was basically the center of attention.\n\nI purchased a new white dress for the night. When I put it on before we left, my husband told me that the dress was practically see-through and left nothing to the imagination. I looked in the mirror, and he seemed to be exaggerating, so I told him that it wasn't nearly as noticeable as he was making it out to be. You could sort of see the outline of my bra, but everyone wears underwear, and, unless someone was deliberately looking, it wasn't an issue. We went back and forth a bit \u2014 I didn't have any other dresses that fit me, as I recently gained a bit of weight and haven't had a need to dress formal, he said he\u2019d rather me dress more casually than wear that.\n\nAfter a bit of back-and-forth, he gave in and I wore it. We went to the dinner, I got to meet a lot of his co-workers and bosses, it was lovely. \n\nAfterwards, he wanted to make a post on social media about the night, and asked me to choose which pictures to include. I saw the pictures of me, and my jaw dropped \u2014 the flash from the camera, and the lighting in general, made my outfit **way** more revealing than it looked in the mirror at home. You can see every roll, every freckle, it leaves almost nothing to the imagination. I was completely embarrassed, and told my husband not to post them.\n\nHe told me that he has **no** pictures of him without me, so there's not really much he could post from the night. I asked him to photoshop my outfit a bit, to make my dress less revealing, and he said that he doesn't know how to do that. \n\nAfter an argument, I won and he agreed not to make the post, but he said he still wants to send some to his parents directly. And, I'm sorry Reddit, **none** of them look flattering, they make me almost look naked! He said, since his co-workers and bosses saw me like that, he should at least be able to show his parents as well. I feel like, since my husband agreed that the dress was too revealing, he should be understanding that I don\u2019t want him sharing pictures of it with family. His co-workers and bosses are one thing, I never have to see them again. But family is family. \n\nHe thinks that I\u2019m not being fair. In his words, I insisted on wearing the dress, and now I\u2019m preventing his family from seeing pictures because of it. It\u2019s now Sunday morning and he\u2019s still not giving in. I want to just forget about the whole thing and move on, he seems to really want to share pictures of the night. I\u2019m not sure what to do, whether I should give up and tell him to send it anyway to put it behind us, or whether I should stand up for myself.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for asking him not to share pictures of us?",

He pointed out the issue with your dress and asked you not to wear it. You wore the dress anyway so you got what you wanted. Then you see the pictures and surprise it's as he stated. You demand he doesn't share pictures and again you get what you wanted. He has every right to be frustrated.",

If my husband told me something was see through, I would believe him. Especially if he was adamant enough to request I even go less formal to an event important to him and his work. This wasn't a date, this was an event with the husband's coworkers and bosses. That alone would have had me changing out of something that obviously made my husband uncomfortable. OP has nobody but herself to blame with this one, and no right to ask her husband not to share photos with his family. All she had to do was actually trust and respect her partner's judgement, but apparently she doesn't, like at all.",

That is 100% on her and she needs to come up with a good way to apologize to him deeply for embarrassing him in front of all of his WORK colleagues. Sounds like a major professional event. She should be ashamed of her behavior for ignoring him and not respecting him enough to look in the mirror properly. Her behavior may still impact their career advancement there. \n\nBut, OP can absolutely crop herself from all of the photos. \n\nHusband can use/send out the cropped photos however he wants.",

It had a solid piece up top, a dense but slightly lighter coloured mesh band from the top of the bust line to just above the waist, and then was solid black below. It looked lovely. We had all seen her in it before.   She looked great in it and very professional. If you looked carefully you could see it was mesh but you def couldn\u2019t SEE see through it. It was just an interesting design feature. At the event, photos were taken and posted online for everyone in attendance to download as they wished. She was in a series of group photos with someone quite notable and, under the flash, the mesh band that revealed nothing in person was basically see-through. She might as well have just gone to the event in a skirt and bra. She was mortified and everyone felt really bad for her but there was nothing that could be done at that point. \n\nI feel really bad for OP and I agree w all the people saying the photos need to be edited or remain uncirculated. Having said that, def YTA because this is one of those cases where, even if what her husband was concerned about was not specifically the transparent flash photo issue, it was his event and, assuming her husband doesn\u2019t have a history of being controlling, OP should have listened. He gets to be miffed and earned a legit \u201cI told you so\u201d out of it. OP should take the initiative and offer to get the photos edited so he can have one or two from the event that he can use. \n\nAlso I really hope her husband shakes it off and cuts her some slack sooner rather than later cause honestly it doesn\u2019t sound like she insisted on wearing the dress to be stubborn. She had gained some weight and wanted something that fit well so she could feel more attractive in her skin. Now she feels bad and exposed.  It is ok for him to be annoyed but if he is a good egg he will get over it and help her to feel less crummy about the whole thing cause it totally sucks.",

And then willingly went to an event to be photographed that way. So, I just think she\u2019s got a hell of a lot of nerve to complain now.",

Or, depending on what kind of dress, why wouldn't she had bought an underdress (don't know the exact word of it but basically a dress or body suit the color of the dress so even when it becomes see-through due light you wouldn't look naked at all) to go with it in case of it being very see-through. I always do that with my white clothes I know have a chance of going see-through due different lighting.",

Your husband decides to wear pants that are so tight and light that you can see his manscaping and whether or not he's been cut. You tell him that those pants leave nothing to the imagination and maybe he should wear different ones, but he insists. You get the pics and your husband's veggie-smuggling operation is on full display and he's very embarrassed and doesn't want you to post or send to anyone. **All** of the pics you have from the night that show your beautiful gown are together with your husband, and **all** include your husband's vacuum-packed kielbasa.

You didn't *knowingly* wear a dress that was super see through. You thought it showed a hint of bra and that's what your husband was upset about. You were comfortable being seen with a hint of bra showing. You *weren't* prepared to have \"every freckle\" seen. It doesn't matter how much your husband warned you if, when you look in the mirror with your own eyes, you see something different. Were you just supposed to believe what you were seeing was incorrect? It's reasonable to assume your husband might have been upset over the bra showing, as that isn't typical for formal dresses, and some people would consider that leaving nothing to the imagination. My guess is that you only saw yourself under your bathroom or bedroom lights, where there was a mirror, whereas your husband saw you in different lighting, leading to your differing opinions about the dress. \n\nYou made a mistake based on limited knowledge of how the dress would look in other lighting. I don't think you need to consent to your husband sharing nearly-naked pics of you because of a judgement error. Having gone out in public like that is punishment enough. \n\nThat said, it shouldn't be hard to just crop you out or find a filter you can adjust the picture colors with. If you describe the problem to a photoshop sub, I'm sure someone can give you advice on fixing the pictures.",

And then you bullied him into not posting pictures to mark his achievement.\n\nWhy on earth did you do any of this? Was the idea of your husband having a night celebrating him that upsetting to you that you just had to find a way to spoil it? You should be ashamed of yourself. Not only did you humiliate your husband in front of his colleagues, you are now refusing to let him show off pictures of that night to his parents.\n\nThe damage of this may be something he deals with for years in his career. Do you really think his colleagues won't have talked about your inappropriate clothing? Do you think it reflected well or poorly on him? Do you think his parents won't realise that you are the sole reason their son's celebration was spoiled? Do you think he will forget that a night supposed to celebrate him is now irrevocably tainted by your behaviour?\n\nYou need to apologise profusely and stop making everything about you. Pay for someone to photoshop the pictures out of your personal finances, so that at the very least, your husband can salvage something from the night you destroyed. And try to find a way to make it up to him. Because the entire situation is your solely *your* fault.",

If someone who doesn't usually say anything bad about my clothes were to tell me to rethink an outfit, I would absolutely listen to them.\n\nLet him share the photos.

You become very stubborn and wear the dress anyway, and lo and behold, it is indeed too revealing.  \n\nNow, after embarrassing him in front of his bosses and coworkers (which you did on a special night for him), you're forbidding him from sharing photos of his accomplishment to his parents. \n\nHonestly OP, you sound very selfish throughout this post. Not once are you looking at things from your husband's perspective. He just wants to give photos to his parents. My advice is stop arguing with him, accept that you messed up, and maybe listen more.

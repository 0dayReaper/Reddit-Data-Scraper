    "postText": "Hello! So, me and my best friend have always been on good terms. We messaged every day, talked all the time, played video games together .etc. We used to live in the same city but he's since moved away, 3 years ago. But we've stayed in touch and everything. Starting in January, things started getting weird. He stopped messaging as often, when we did talk, he was always very angry or frustrated which made me think I'd done something wrong. We had a Friday gaming session and he would cancel at the last minute. One of our close mutual friends (who is closer with him than me) started acting strange too and started excluding me from events, stopped messaging me at all, in events that had groups, he'd put me in different groups to them, it all felt very strange. Then a few weeks ago, I planned a holiday for our friendship group, the mutual friend basically insisted he arrived later (but I said it wouldn't be possible for travel reasons), but the main friend that this post is about cancelled a week before. The holiday had been planned out 8 months before and he was also the only person who didn't have to pay. I paid for him because I was so keen to see him as it'd been so long. \n\nWhilst on the holiday, he had a go at me for spoiling the result of a boxing match 2 hours after it had happened. For me, this was unfair. Its a live sports event, surely you either watch or you don't? Maybe you have it paused and you're 5/10 minutes behind but not 2 hours. So that was the last straw with me and I just said \"what's the problem? What's your issue?\" And we talked it out in which he said about how we're becoming different people and he didn't like the way I was taking our friendship. I was more frustrated that he didn't just talk to me about this from the beginning but also, as we were talking about it, he stopped replying again so we never even got into it properly. But I respected his wishes and took a step back. \n\nHe messaged me this week and I admittedly am a bit sour about the whole thing so I took a couple days to reply as he's been doing something similar to me this whole time and he has now not replied at all and again I'm getting a vibe that he's pissed with me. I saw our mutual friend since then and again something feels up. I feel it's fair considering thats what he's been doing this past 6 months but then when I do it to him, he's annoyed with me.  Was that an asshole thing to do to purposely wait before replying? Am I the asshole?",

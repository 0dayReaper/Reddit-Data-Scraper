There is no way for you to police her interactions with everybody and you can\u2019t prevent her from meeting new people or being introduced by other mutual friends to those people you would rather she didn\u2019t meet.\n\nSo, in the longer term it\u2019s likely that this will happen again - either with somebody she doesn\u2019t meet via your circle of friends, or, if she is intentionally separating you from those closest to you, by her waiting to meet others you are close to.\n\nEither way, she isn\u2019t a good friend to you - however or whyever it is achieved, separating someone from those they care about is toxic and abusive behaviour and is unlikely to change; and you are setting yourself up to spend a lot of time, effort and emotional energy managing your worry about this and her social connections in order to be comfortable around her.\n\nThat is a lot of energy to expend on someone who doesn\u2019t care enough about you to be kind and to refrain from bullying you by excluding you from seeing other friends,\n\nBut also: you should put some time into learning how to let people you care about have a life and connections that don\u2019t involve you - friendships are not fixed entities and you cannot control who spends time with whom. There is never any good reason to need to ask to be included by someone who says they are close to you, so you would be better off finding friends who like and respect you enough to *want* go include you rather than chasing after those who keep you around to feed their own ego but don\u2019t really value your time and attention.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (21f) want to clarify that I don\u2019t feel this way with other friends; just this one. Let\u2019s call her Charlotte (20f). You may need some background for this one. \nIn the past I would introduce charlotte to a lot of my other friends. One time, though, she became super super close to one girl I introduced her to and they blocked me out. \n\nIt was really shitty of her, and when they eventually fell through she admitted to me that it wasn\u2019t fully unintentional. She had her reasons, but obviously it was never good enough for me. \n\nI could tell her to include me when they do something, and she still wouldn\u2019t. She would pretend that she forgot. I could be included in a plan and they two would go ahead without me anyway. \n\nI distanced from her for a while but now we\u2019re close again. She is my closest friend. I have chosen to forgive her and I thought I could forget it, but I am realizing now I am uncomfortable with introducing her to certain friends that I really like. \n\nShe just goes all in and starts calling them all the time and meeting them. Sometimes she falls through with a person I\u2019ve introduced her to and I end up losing that person as collateral damage. \nI can think of 3 people off the top of I\u2019ve head who I\u2019ve introduced her to, they\u2019ve hit it off and gotten super close in a short time, then they fight and fall out. \n\nAITA for actively trying to keep some of my friends separate from her? \nFor context the betrayal happened around 2 years ago. She\u2019s a much better friend to me now, but I can\u2019t help but not trust her fully. I feel guilty for feeling this way, but I can\u2019t deny it.\n\nI don\u2019t think she does it on purpose (making me lose friends/acquaintances). She just dives too deep too quickly with people and doesn\u2019t set boundaries, puts them on a pedestal, and when those things inevitably cause conflict the other person is labeled an asshole even though she\u2019s the one who allowed that. I wouldn\u2019t mind introducing her if she was normal about it, but she tries to become best friends with them. Then I feel threatened, because in the past she did me wrong. \n\nMost of the time when we hang out it is one on one. I love having her as a one on one friend, she\u2019s been there for me a lot and I do love her. But when other people get involved is when I start feeling weird. That\u2019s why I feel guilty, like I want to keep her as a private friend only and keep having my other groups of friends. She doesn\u2019t have a lot of other friends besides me, which is why I think she\u2019s so desperate to get close to anyone I introduce her to.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "comment": "NTA, but there's two ways I look at it.\n\n1. You have a problem with her because she befriended someone you introduced her to and wasn't previously friends with, they became friends and then they ended up blocking you out. Your response? You are blocking her out from your friends including potentially your new friends. If she's wrong, then you're wrong. It could be said, that 'What's good for the goose is good for the gander', however, it could also be said, 'Two wrongs don't make a right.' The former is vengeful which has a way of backfiring at times. The latter is more principled and not hypocritical.\n2. On the other hand, Insanity can be defined as doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. You are attempting to handle her differently but keeping her from your friends. This is a different tactic and I applaud you for changing your approach. However, as stated, may not be the best approach. I think the best approach would be to let this person go. From the sounds of it, this person violated a trust boundary with you. Personally, I would have a zero-tolerance policy with my boundaries. The problem with this is that it doesn't allow for the fact that people grow and change. I don't know how much time has passed, but you also have other friends; you don't need this person. Or do you? If you do need her even with other friends, then you need to process why you need her and how much time has passed. After, if you feel you need her in your life, then you cannot blame her for any repeat of her previous behavior. In this case, you'll BTA. To yourself. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me!",

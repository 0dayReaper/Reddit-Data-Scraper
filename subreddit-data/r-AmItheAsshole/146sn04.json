My biggest concern for you here is that you can't do the overnight stay as you both planned...I think you should use that for your out.",

I live in what is almost certainly a different country from yours, and there is undoubtedly a huge gap between our customs and yours. However, we do have colleges / universities here, and they do have orientation weeks.\n\nI have never heard of anyone bringing an outsider to an orientation event. I suspect if anyone tried, they'd be laughed at.\n\nAt the university I attended (as a student, and later as staff member), I heard this story through the staff grapevine:\n\nMother: \"Am I allowed to accompany my son to the orientation events?\"\n\nAdministration: \"I would strongly advise against it.\"\n\nMother: \"But he won't know anyone!\"\n\nAdministration: \"That's what orientation is **for**. To get to know people. To make friends. And trust me, that's not going to happen with his mother holding his hand.\"\n\nTell your cousin he's not going to make friends if he's dragging his younger cousin around with him like an emotional support animal. Wish him well, wave him goodbye, and leave him to it.",

We have a very close almost brotherly relationship. I faintly asked what it was about and he said we would basically just walk around the city and tour the campus. I committed to him there saying I would go and he bought my train ticket and paid a $25 fee for me to go to the orientation. Fast forward to now he sent me the schedule which is packed with ice breakers and signing forms. Needless to say after realizing my day would start at 9 to basically just watch my cousin fill out forms and then partake in what I can only assume will be extremely awkward ice breakers the whole time. (Literally the entire day) I was also supposed to spend the night with him on campus but am not allowed to since a I will not actually be attending the school. Overall we only have around 6 hours to really be together in the city outside of the orientation and I feel like I was deceived on what I would actually be doing. I brought up this concern to him yesterday where he basically told me my concern was wrong and we were going to be hanging out around the city just having fun. I doubled down and said i\u2019d support him. I have brought up the concern a ton within the last week and he always shoots me down immediately but i\u2019m just so confused on why he needs me to almost hold his hand at this orientation. I\u2019ve had a ton of anxiety just going back and forth whether I should cancel on him or not, so what do you think AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "comment": "INFO: so if you've determined you can't spend the night, is there a hotel arranged or other accommodation for you? \n\nI'm tempted to say no AH if there's some place you can spend time (or sleep) while he's occupied with forms. \n\nI think it's great that he wants to introduce you to his college and you should accept the opportunity, but I don't get why you have to start your day at 9AM or whatever. You can discuss plans and what activities you're going to do together. As people said, college students frequently miss most of the scheduled orientation activities. You really shouldn't be going to the icebreakers with him. That's a crutch for him to avoid meeting people that will only hurt him. But if you can show up for a walking tour of the campus and spend 6 hours visiting the city and having a farewell tour with your cousin, helping him feel comfortable and letting him tell you about the experiences, maybe meet his favorite peers from orientation, I think it could be a really nice experience. Maybe this is also a way for him to encourage you to join him at this college in a couple of years. If he expects you to spend 8 hours going to icebreakers and watching him fill out forms, then you should back out, but a) he probably can cut that time a bit shorter and b) if you can arrange a quiet space to watch movies, read books, or otherwise keep yourself entertained, that time will go quickly and you may get some quality time for both of you afterwards.",

The fact you can't stay overnight in the dorms is another indicator. \n\nBesides, who wants to spend the day explaining yourself to others who will be asking you about your interests in a college you won't even be attending? People who want to get to know you certainly will be asking. \n\nWish your cousin well and stay home.",

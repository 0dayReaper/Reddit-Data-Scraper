Nobody is required to open their home to you, especially when it's not technically their home and they have people there who may or may not get along with you. So, NAH as long as you accept L's statement and don't try to push it.",

And if it did, then neither of your invites would be genuine friendship. You invite him as a manipulation tactic to get an invitation from him later. He invites you out of obligation for accepting your invites. That's a terrible \"friendship!\"",

L\u2018s mom and I get along well, his dad however, openly disliked my when we were younger. We\u2019ve never had an argument or a bigger issue, but even L says that his dad \u201eT\u201c is super difficult to deal with. When we were children, T would often make remarks about my hair, the fact I had a phone at 9 or just be generally very confrontational towards me. Other parents at my elementary school would tell my parents how T would badmouth me to them. He also once searched my phone and then called my parents because of some inappropriate erotic pics I had on it. I was about 12/13 when that happened. My father told me years later that all parents disliked T at school and he\u2019d often have arguments at school parent meetings.\nT is a child\u2019s psychologist btw.\nT and L also don\u2019t get along well, L openly says that T is an unlikable prick\n\nIn recent years I haven\u2019t seen him much but when I did, me and T were somewhat friendly, no bad feelings really. We sometimes bumped into each other when shopping. \n\nAs kids, we often had sleep overs, so I\u2019m familiar with their home and I believe I\u2019m welcome (rather tolerated) there. We both move abroad to study and now live in our home town again. \n\nMe and L (who lives at home since rent is high) often watch football games together in a pub. On match day, where the pub didn\u2019t broadcast it, my TV broke down, so I asked L if I could watch it at his place. He refused and was super evasive. When I inquired a bit he said that he\u2019s afraid that me and T would argue a lot (T doesn\u2019t even watch football and we\u2019ve never argued or anything like that). \nSurprinsingly though, T wouldn\u2019t mind me coming, he even said so himself, which I believe since T relatively nicely greets me when he sees me and I was never banned or anything like that, I haven\u2019t visited their place in a long time but T and me get along. \n\n\nI\u2019m a bit on the fence, on the one hand I get that he doesn\u2019t want any conflict in his house, at the same time I couldn\u2019t watch an amazing game just because hes catering to a moody and unlikable person. I always let him watch games at my place. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

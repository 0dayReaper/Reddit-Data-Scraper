Well, she found me after our father died, but that\u2019s irrelevant.\nShe immediately decided we were gonna have a close relationship and even though it made me slightly uncomfortable I was happy to finally have someone to bond with to that level.\n\nWe had similar careers and we decided to take over our dad\u2019s small business together because idk, it just made sense with our background.\n\nSix years ago she was driving me to a meeting and we had a horrible car accident that left me so badly injured that to this day I struggle spending long time standing up (crucial to the job we have), so in the past two years we had some trouble because she feels like I\u2019m being lazy and just leaving her with the hardest part of the job. I see why she would feel that way so I agreed when she suggested we hire her husband to cover for parts of my shifts.\n\nAt first everything seemed perfect, but her husband is the epitome of a manchild and this created a whole new level of issues.\n\nCue to last month:\nThe manchild took another odd job that overlapped with one of our biggest gigs this year. I clarified with the both of them that I wouldn\u2019t be available to cover the whole shift so they\u2019d have to figure out the logistics.\nEveryone agreed.\nThree days before the event she starts asking me questions that aren\u2019t normally in my scope, nonetheless I did some research and found the answers she was looking for, and reminded her that I wasn\u2019t going to be there with her.\n\nShe flipped out. Like drooling screaming full tantrum because I knew her parasite was busy and because only two days of notice weren\u2019t enough for her to find a solution.\nSo I offered to cover partially the shift but stayed adamant I couldn\u2019t do the whole thing. \nMore screaming and door slamming.\nShe texts me from her office to let me know I\u2019m expected to contact our accountants to leave the company.\nShe\u2019s been avoiding me ever since and keeping me in the dark about everything that is not strictly related to my role.\n\nI feel like she shouldn\u2019t be able to force me out of my dad\u2019s business, and I feel she has no right to behave like that.\n\nHer husband and some of our clients and friends however reached out to me because apparently I\u2019m an asshole and a leech.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "postText": "I've seen this asked on this sub a few times but I still wanted to see what people thought of my specific case.I was at the gym today, doing my own thing as always and finishing up my workout. I only had one more main workout on the Lateral Raise Machine. I walked over and saw that a girl was already on it. No big deal, I thought, I'll just wait behind her and relax. I don't mind taking a break to scroll through Reddit anyways because I'm almost done anyways.As I'm scrolling through Reddit for about 10 minutes, I can't help but notice that the girl using the machine is kind of fiddling with the machine, doing maybe 3-5 reps and then sitting there on her phone or just listening to music. Tbh, I know it's not my business whether or not she's actually being productive with her workout or not but at the same time, 10 minutes has gone by and I want to finish up already. So I walk over to her, and politely say to her \"Excuse me, sorry to bug, but do you have a lot more on this machine?\" (something I've asked to a lot of people in my gym career) I can tell right from the beginning that she seems standoffish because she doesn't even take the time to take out her airpods before giving me a look as if to say go away. I have to repeat what I say again before she is willing to take her airpods out to actually hear me/address me.After asking her again how many more sets she has, she responds that she \"doesn't know how many more she has and that she's just trying to workout\". I then ask her if it's cool that I work in, in which she gives me a dirty look and says \"No, I just want to be able to workout.\" I respond, \"Okay but...indefinitely?\" and she says \"I'm just trying to workout\" It seemed like she was getting defensive over me asking her at all and I told her that I'm not being rude by asking, this is pretty normal thing to do. She responds with something to the effect of \"I know that it's normal but I just don't want to share. I want to use it until I'm done.\"I was honestly fucking frustrated at this point because she had already been on the machine for a long time and when I politely asked her, she's telling me she doesn't know how many more she has and simultaneously is telling me she doesn't want to share either. So, how long am I going to wait then? She was also pretty rude and petty during this entire exchange while I was trying to be polite and respectful. I also thought that maybe she's new but it seems like she wasn't if she knows that people asking to join her is the norm but she chooses not to do it.I ended up ending the conversation by saying \"Well, I don't know what's going on in your life to be acting like this but I genuinely hope it gets better because you're acting rude.\"I know people aren't obligated to share if someone asks but if you're going to just fuck around with the machine for as long as you want, with no timeline on when you'll be done, isn't that kind of a dick move?AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for people pointing out she might have been uncomfortable because she thought I was hitting on her. I will keep that in mind the next time I am interacting with women at the gym as it'll help me understand some reactions. \n\nAlso, I know that there are dumbbells but this machine (usually) has less traffic and the free weight area was busy. Its something to keep in mind in the future but honestly didn't expect my interaction to go with her like that. \n\nUm, shout out to those who say that it's obvious I don't go to the gym a lot and I'm clueless, seems like the vast majority of people here are in agreement that I know very basic, standard gym etiquette. \n\nAlso, some of ya'll seem miserable and must be horrible to be around in real life wow good luck :)",

There were these two women standing in front of my locker having a casual conversation.\n\nI stood there for about 30-45 seconds waiting for them to acknowledge me and then move. They didn't. I spoke up \"Excuse me\". They both turned and looked at me with such smug expressions on their faces. I pointed to my locker and said \"I need to get into my locker\". Their expressions changed so quickly and dramatically, they were anticipating shooting me down because the only possible reason they could think of that I was interrupting their conversation was that I wanted to hit on one of them. When it ended up being about something else, it changed the whole feeling of the interaction.\n\nI would bet money that's exactly what was going on with OP.

This is the main part of someone's workout and often has a significant number of sets if you include warmup and buildup ones.  My average bench or squat workout is 6-7 sets and I have heavy workouts that I used to do on off-hours that were 10+ and would take close to 30 minutes - I would be an AH to do that during the after-work rush.  When you're going super heavy, your recovery times shoot up too, it's not abnormal to spend 3 minutes between work sets.  If you're going that heavy that you need high rest times, definitely be willing to let people work in too unless it'll require an excessive amount of plate changes, i.e. more than 150lb difference in weight.\n\nFor machines though?  Most people are doing 3-4 sets of 8-10.  a set takes 30 seconds, and most people are resting 60-90 seconds between, so 10 minutes on a given machine is a safe time limit.",

That way neither of you is stuck waiting around for half an hour or more while the other just sits on the bench in between sets.\n\nI've admittedly never done this with random people at a gym, but I have done it with family members, especially when living in apartment complexes with \"workout rooms\" in the community center, as those generally only had one each of the various weight machines, and maybe as many as three each of cardio equipment such as treadmills or stationary bikes.",

I know it's not as organized as some, **but every time I end up satisfyingly sore the next few days.**\n\nYou\u2019re probably over training. DOMs past 1-2 days is not really optimal as you aren\u2019t recovered enough to train that muscle group again for too long of a period. Ideally you want to be training each muscle group 1-2 times weekly with x2 being the goal. \n\nNuking yourself then not being able to train the muscle group for 4+ days reduces the total number of times you can train the muscle in a month/year etc and lowers your overall volume.",

At least in my gym it's like this : the machines are always being used by a bunch of big dudes and I never dare to go there, because they watch, sometimes they try to hit on you, and they are using heavy weights, and I'm not sure how to use the machine, so it makes me nervous. Each time I use a machine (rare occurrences) I feel on edge and really not comfortable. Maybe (big maybe) that could be what happened to her.\n\nMaybe that was also what triggered the \"I don't know how many sets\" problem. If she's kind of new and you obviously know what your doing, maybe she doesn't have a number of rep or sets, she's just working out until she feels sore, and you asking that question (with no bad intentions) made her feel judged or something. \n\nI see that you were just waiting for your work out and I do not doubt that, but just keep in mind that being a woman in a gym can be uncomfortable.",

It's a safety thing - better to be safe than sorry, ya know?\n\n10 minutes really isn't a lot of time for some people, especially if the person gets distracted easily or has no concept of time. Maybe she was trying to learn to use the machine efficiently? That usually takes time. (Of course, though, she should be doing that when she ISN'T on the machine, but still.) Again, the attitude she had wasn't necessary, but it is understandable.\n\nYou're NTA, overall.

But escalating it at the end like that is never going to get the other person to get that they're being rude. \n\nIt should be well known gym etiquette that you don't just sit on a machine indefinitely without being willing to let others work in.  I'm a woman and I've definitely had people react badly to a polite \"may I work in, in between your sets?\"  Some people are just jerks and cluing them in to their jerkness never works.\n\nHowever, if you're a guy, it's entirely possible that she was so sure you were hitting on her that she wasn't really fully processing it.

Once, I was doing my thing, and I was using the same equipment for several different exercises so I was hoging it for a while. A guy stood close by, just hanging, looking my way. He was weirding me out a bit, so I asked if he was waiting for the equiment to break the tension and see where he was at. He said he was, I offered that we could work in between, trying to be nice and not assuming the worst. He accepted, and ended up hitting on me, giving me unsolicited form advice (that was bad and would have injured me), tried to spot me and touched me when it wasnt needed or asked for, wouldnt back off, and in the end I just skipped the last of my sets because I felt unsafe and he didnt listen. If she has had similare experiences, having a guy stabling behind her for 10 minutes might have freaked her out a lot more than you think.\n\nOr she is just rude. You were NTA regardless for asking, but might want to just involve staff before you get to the point of arguing and frustration, easier to let them deal with it before any tensions run too high.",

That makes them assholes. If she's soooo traumatized that a man merely interacting with her at the gym makes her thinks she gets to be an ass, then that is HER fault.",

            "comment": "NTA. I agree with most of the comments saying that you responded fine, but that maybe she was caught off guard and felt uncomfortable whether she felt like she was being hit on or just new to the gym. I also agree that you could\u2019ve found a variation. \n\nI\u2019d like to share my workout experience as a woman, personal trainer, and person diagnosed with anemia and POTS (which not saying this girl is obviously, but many smaller woman are also diagnosed w both of these). Very often I am starred at in the gym, majority of the time by men (rarely women), and I am approached often with the intention of connecting romantically. It is an uncomfortable experience I have gotten used to over time, but it is still very uncomfortable. I have a boyfriend (not that this matters), this isn\u2019t something i\u2019m interested in, but i\u2019m polite anyway as she should have been. \n\nI have also gotten approached tons of times to share equipment and while I understand people have good intentions, some people do have medical diagnosis that make working out a longer experience for them. I can take 5 mins rest doing a compound leg movement and still feel winded and i think that\u2019s pretty common whether you have pots/anemia or not, but especially if you have any medical diagnosis that makes breathing more difficult. Just something to keep in mind. Being approached to share equipment does make me uncomfortable for this reason and because it\u2019s socially awkward for me as I also have anxiety. I also just love the gym as personal time w myself and being interrupted is less than optimal sometimes, even on days when I enjoy chatting w people I know. It also makes you feel pressured to finish faster and like you\u2019re suddenly aware someone is watching you. Some people have been through SA or another life experience that has made being watched feel extra scary or uncomfortable. \n\nJust a few things to take into consideration. Maybe applicable here or not, but my personal philosophy is just to find a variation or just wait or pick a new movement pattern all together and fit the previous one in another day because I\u2019d rather adjust my own workout which is very easy and manageable in my opinion than make someone else uncomfy. Just food for thought. I totally understand not everyone views it this way.",

IT\u2019S OKAY TO HAVE TO EDIT YOUR WORKOUT. IT\u2019S NOT ACTUALLY THAT MUCH OF AN INCONVENIENCE. I DO IT ALL THE TIME WHEN MEN TAKE TOO LONG ON MACHINES. \n\nI won\u2019t pass judgment but it just amazes me that I grew up being harassed by men in every conceivable space, during every kind of activity, and now we exist in this strange vacuum where men are pretending they don\u2019t know why we act suspicious or intimidated when we\u2019re approached for any reason. \n\nBelieve that when this happens to me, I would LOVE to give men the benefit of the doubt, but 99% of the time I\u2019m still getting hit on. \n\nNot saying her reaction was correct, but consider what must have happened to this girl in the past for this to be her programmed response, rather than a smile and a \u201chello.\u201d It takes a lot to set your default to \u201cthreatened.\u201d",

I (f,23) workout at a busy gym where the lat pull-down is taken the majority of the time I\u2019m there, so a lot of the time I end up leaving it til last bc it\u2019s taken whenever I\u2019m finished with an exercise then just wait in close proximity for 10 minutes (not super close, just so I can see the machine and get to it when they\u2019re done) til the person using it is finished (or ask if I can work in with them after 10 minutes passes)\n\nIt\u2019s that, not using it at all, or grabbing it super quickly in the brief periods it\u2019s free while I\u2019m in the middle of a set of another exercise (which means I have to hope the machine/equipment im using then isn\u2019t taken but it very likely will be so I\u2019ll have to wait for that after).\n\nI think if I were a dude I\u2019d maybe give even more space??

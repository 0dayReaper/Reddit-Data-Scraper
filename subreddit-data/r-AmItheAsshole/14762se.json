We both have very strict/cultural/religious parents and didn't want to risk them finding out about our relationship. When we started dating, we agreed that we wouldn't tell anyone until we felt the time was right. This was due to our parents and also the fact that we felt it would be easier to work through issues in our relationship without any outside influence. I 100% trust my best friend and never felt she would tell anyone, but this was just something my boyfriend and I had discussed.\n\nFast forward to now, almost 2 years later, my boyfriend and I decided it was time to tell our closest friends that we were dating. When I told my best friend, she was shocked and upset at first (understandably) but after we talked she seemed like she understood my reasons for not telling anyone. I thought that our conversation went well. A couple of days later at an event, I sat down next to her but she didn't talk to me at all and barely looked in my direction. She also hasn't texted me since I told her. I know that 2 years is a very long time to keep a secret and I understand why she might be upset, but I guess I got comfortable with the way my relationship with my boyfriend was going. So, AITA for not telling my best friend about my relationship?",

Now she knows you a) don't trust her b) can lie to her about important stuff for long periods of time.\n\nI understand that in your mind you had good reasons to lie but that doesnt change the fact that you broke her trust. Not to mention you damaged your relationship with your best friend bc you prioritised a boyfriend. That always stings, especially if she was there first.\n\nI hate to be harsh but people deserve best friends that don't hide such a key part of their lives from them.",

You can tell them they are sworn to secrecy but whether they have the integrity to keep it under wraps is another thing. Maybe you can trust them with some.things but not others. They may be trustworthy but there is still a chance of slip up in lively conversation. When divulging a secret, you accept the risk.",

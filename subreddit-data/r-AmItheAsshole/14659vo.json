    "postText": "Long story short, my husband\u2019s family: his 2 parents, and one sister (+husband &amp; 3 kids) have either lived in the *same house* or next-door to one another for 10+ years.\n\nFive years ago we started our own family and now have two kids  (4 years and 1 year). We (happily) live 2 1/2 hours away. The compound life ain\u2019t for me. \n\nMy mother and father-in-law have co-parented my two preteen nephews and 8YO niece their entire lives. They have almost every meal together, my father-in-law often being the cook and I\u2019m pretty sure my mother-in-law buys most of the kids toys and clothes. My SIL has not worked outside of the home since having her eldest. Now they ALL homeschool the 3 kids together.\n\nDuring the pandemic, we didn\u2019t get to see each other much, because I had a newborn, and a dad going through chemo and they all insisted on being unvaccinated. This made holidays nearly impossible for two years. \n\nMy sister-in-law posted on every holiday how  \u201cbeing with family is the only thing that matters and it\u2019s obvious who doesn\u2019t show up.\u201d - it\u2019s obvious who that was about. Their entire family lives within 10 miles of one another and we were the only ones not at Christmas. I took that for being the nature of a really hard post pandemic life. I hoped things would improve. \n\nGuess what! Now we still \u201cdon\u2019t show up\u201d because we don\u2019t drive 2+ hours to go to my nephew\u2019s baseball games on Thursday nights (we both have full-time jobs) and don\u2019t make an extra trip to show up to birthday parties if will literally be in town the following week. (My niece is born right before Christmas, my nephews the week before we go on a family beach trip together). The kids only have family at parties - no friends/peers - so I guess it\u2019s obvious. \n\nMy sister-in-law constantly posts on Facebook \ud83d\ude44 how her kids \u201cknow who doesn\u2019t show up for them\u201d and texts my husband the same thing when we say we can\u2019t make something. Her parents brought her kids to my daughters soccer game last fall (she stayed home\u2026) and they all carpooled to my daughter\u2019s recital in May so I guess she\u2019s a saint. \n\nRegardless, I love the kids and I feel she\u2019s poisoning them against us. She\u2019s the only one at this point who makes us feel so distant and her own kids feel abandoned. I think this comes down to enmeshment and immaturity. But truly, AITA? So confused.",

My family had our 7-day beach trip scheduled the week before, a no-go for two working parents. (They used to stay 20 people to a 10 person house and once I had kids I said that\u2019s not ok &amp; we need a room. They put my cousin-in-law in a room with 3 teenage boys right after she had a baby\u2026nursing!). \n\nThe main issue is that *any* kid\u2019s birthday we miss is a drama meltdown. And honestly, I don\u2019t want to feed into that whatsoever. The expectations are impossible - if she was independent of her parents, found a purpose other than family, had friends and knew any other way of life but the one she\u2019s lived since she was born - she would know that too.",

So they have a ratio of 4 adults to 3 kids with only her husband working 40 hrs a week outside the home.  So they still have a 3 adults to 3 kids ratio even with the husband working outside the home.\n\nWhereas you and your husband have a 2 adults to 2 kids ratio  PLUS you have to work a minimum of 80hrs a week outside of the home and have to squeeze all your home maintenance and chores into the time after work.  But your SIL can be homeschooling the kids and she still has her mom to do the work she would normally do like cooking cleaning washing clothes and your sil has her dad to do yard work and home maintenance that you and your husband have to squeeze in after work and on weekends.",

    "postText": "I was on my pc when my sister, who's in her late 30's, came into my room to ask me to watch my niece for her. I got up and said \"sure but not in my room\" because my niece always likes to mess around with my pc's buttons and wires. However, my sister took it the wrong way and said it was fine and closed the door hard on my face. This really upset me but I didn't do or say anything, just sat back in my pc.\n\nAfter some time passes my mom entered my room and I tried explaining the situation to her. She cut me off and got really upset with me and gaslit me, saying that my sister never closed the door \"that hard\", that I \"had an attitude\" and my sister was pregnant so she got emotional and cried. at this point, I got upset and said \"just cuz she's pregnant she can treat me like shit?\" I know i may have overreacted here, but I was just so upset my mom was acting so defensive against me. so my mom ran and got up in my face, shouting in my face that I was being so rude and left. then my dad came in trying to talk to me and I told him I didn't wanna talk because I was already so upset. He then was telling me that everyone agrees that I was being very inconsiderate, selfish and that I was making a big deal out of nothing.\n\nAt that point, I was having a full blown panic attack. I left the family group chat and have decided to give everyone the silent treatment (which will definitely go downhill) I feel like I'm going crazy trying to decide if I was the asshole or not. so, AITA?\n\nEDIT:I shouldve clarified that my sister doesnt live with me, she was visiting for a bit \\^\\^; and I am 21 F and live in the middle east, so I cant move out until im married. I have a boyfriend so that'll be my escape plan lol\n\nEDIT 2: Also, I\u2019ve always said yes every time she asked me to watch her baby, I have no problem with it (just not in my room) Idk why this time she was so weird about it.",

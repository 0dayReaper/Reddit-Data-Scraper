Both of you agree or it shouldn't happen. Your husband has treated you abominably. I'm not sure I could deal with that honestly. Can you go stay w your mom?",

Does he actively treat you like a partner or does he just decide things and you go along to keep the peace? This will not get better, OP, if you don't set some major boundaries. Again, that he did this WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL.. suggests he knew you didn't agree and wanted to present it as a done deed you couldn't/wouldn't argue with. Go stay with Mom and let him enjoy lying in the (filthy) bed he's made. I'd honestly tell him that you're not coming back until they're gone and your house is as clean as when you left it. If he won't or can't then you know where his priorities are. \n\nYou're pregnant. The house you describe is unfit to bring a newborn into, depending on HOW bad and what country you live in, Child Protective services could step in. Is your marriage worth potentially losing custody your baby over? Bc I can tell you right now that it shouldn't be. That baby has to be your number one priority, and living in a house full of dirty dishes and moldy food ain't it sis. My heart hurts for you but you deserve SO MUCH BETTER.",

You're now pregnant with his child and tied to him forever, this is when a lot of abusers show their true colors. It's time for you to start thinking about exit strategies.\n\nNTA, in fact I think you are under-reacting (which is understandable considering your current health)\n\nEdit: I want to thank everyone for their awards and for sharing their stories. I know there can be bad feelings attached to some of these memories and I hope OP reads all of them and understands this is unfortunately not a unique situation.\n\nFor the record OP, I do hope that things aren't as bad as they seem to us outsiders based on this one story, but for your sake and that of your child please at least get a plan in place in case we are correct.",

I separated from my abuser 3 years ago, and it's been the best time. It took about a year to leave him fully, as I kept going back to him.\n\nWhen you see red flags, if you can't safely communicate with your partner, step away. My current partner displays accountability when confronted with a problem behaviour. He looks into himself, thinks about the impact of his actions, apologises, and changes his behaviour. \n\nIf they kick off at you and don't show remorse or changed behaviour, just leave. You're not a rehabilitation centre for abusive people, let them fix their own problems while you are safely not involved.",

I read reply after reply \" Happened to me too\".\n\nIt's a lot, been there, pregnant, tied to an abusive man who flipped that switch. No one here is trying to alarm you although it's scary, yes. We've been there and our hearts are genuinely with you. \n\nYou're pregnant, you deserve to be treated with respect, love and support. No one can tell you what to do, obviously. I hung in there hoping beyond hope the person I thought he was would ' poof ' appear again. Mistake, ended up having to scramble with a newborn. Luckily had your kind of support with my family. The situation you have now might not get better across the board. It's too much. NTA times around a million.\n\n30 years later he's gone ( years ago ) that baby is a doctor of chemistry, now pregnant herself. We get through it.",

He very well may just be having a bit of a breakdown, you obviously know him much better than we do. This scenario would really have me rethinking the life I wanted to build with him though, it\u2019s really concerning that this switch only flipped once you were that far along *and* had a high risk problem arise (which would increase your dependence on him). Please just keep yourself safe and remember that you deserve so much better than this treatment.",

You need to know that it\u2019s going to dial up a bit and peak at around week 16-18, if you\u2019re lucky it will recede for a while, and then come back around the end of the third trimester. Some people have it for their entire pregnancy if they\u2019re unlucky. Fun fact, new studies are showing it comes from the father of the baby or the woman\u2019s father. There are a lot of WhatsApp or Facebook support groups, you should absolutely join one because it is very isolating. Just know that even though you will be throwing up, feeling miserable, and losing a ton of weight, your body will be prioritizing the baby and it will be OK. Also, the minute you pop it out you will be able to eat food again.\n\nHowever, that makes your husband and his mother even bigger monsters. Because you *were hospitalized* due to being pregnant with *his child* and *her grandchild*, and they dare treat you like this? He moves in his dysfunctional and messy family without your consent  and demands that you serve them? His mother blasts you for not being a better host and taking care of them while you\u2019re trying to stay in bed and keep the baby alive as if there was no other functioning adult able to do their own work? Shame on them. Seriously, sic your mother on them. \n\nYou should absolutely let your husband and his mother know how much they failed you, and how much support you\u2019re going to need. You should also possibly move in with your mother because an HG G pregnancy can be brutal, and they don\u2019t think seem capable of giving you the support you need.",

How many kids do they even have? This sounds like hell in your house. If they stay longer than 30 days you'll have to formally evict them.",

By helping with their kids when she is tired\n\nUm...your husband knows you\u2019re 4 months pregnant with his kid right? Right???\n\n&gt;\"Since your family can stay so can we.\" My mom quickly took charge.\n\nMom and brothers of the year! Glad your mom and your brothers had your back because clearly your husband is against you in this situation.\n\n&gt;I got a text message from my MIL for calling me an A for not helping my husband clean up the house and putting my BIL in a uncomfortable situation by having my mom boss him around\n\nOMFG is everyone in your husband's family this dense or forgetful? YOU ARE PREGNANT. All of this stress and strain could cause you to (god forbid) lose your child. Your husband put your BIL in this situation and YOUR husband put YOU in this uncomfortable situation. Bro, seems like your husband and his family are seriously inconsiderate. Also, I find it hilarious that your MIL texted you to scold you for getting your mom involved when she, herself had gotten involved \ud83d\ude02\n\nOP, your husband and his family are walking red flags. Either try couples therapy or reconsider this marriage\n\nEDIT: So it has come to my attention that OP's BIL lied. Didn\u2019t even tell MIL that he and his family got evicted, that the house was a mess, and the state BIL put the house in. Sooo, yeah I can\u2019t be too upset with the MIL IF she is taking OP's side now",

I had that and at first my husband and doctor didn't take it seriously until I was vomiting to the point of passing out on the bathroom floor and I lost 20lbs in the first trimester. \n\nYour husband is a huge AH and he's not treating you well or considering your safety and the safety of his child. This is one of those defining moments where he either needs to get his head out of his backside and act right or you need to leave because it will only get worse. This is how he's treating you when you're sick before the baby even gets here, how will he treat you when you're recovering from labor and need help taking care of a newborn? Is this really the environment you want your child to grow up in?",

WITHOUT you there to make sure he does everything properly\n\nhe was wildly abusive to you when you're dangerously ill. he risked the health and well being of both his spouse and his soon to be child. can you trust someone like that with your health and well being in the future? can you trust someone like that with the health and well being of your child?",

Good job reaching out immediately and shutting your husband's BS down. \n\nI can guarantee the shame your husband is feeling right now that has been heaped upon him by both your mother and his mother will go a LONG way towards ensuring he never pulls this kind of crap again. \n\nIf you are willing to consider moving forward with your marriage, I'd tell him he needs to stay elsewhere until you find a marriage counselor and start the counseling process. He betrayed you in so many ways. Moving a whole family into your house without your permission while you were hospitalized is a massive betrayal. Leaving the house destroyed is a massive betrayal. Allowing his brother's family to treat you the way they did in your home is a massive betrayal. Speaking the way he did to you was a massive betrayal. But add to it the fact that you are 4 months pregnant with hypernemasis and have a fresh concussion... I don't know what to say other than his callous disregard for your health is not something easy to come back from and the fact that he doesn't understand the gravity of what he did... this is where hopefully counseling will help.",

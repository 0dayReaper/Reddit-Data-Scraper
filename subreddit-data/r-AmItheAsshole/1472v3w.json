It's not healthy to teach a kid to keep secrets from their parent.  If Will was telling other kids at school, that would be a problem and something to discourage.  But you should *want* your kid letting you know about things that worry him or puzzle him about their friends, so you can talk about them with your kid.\n\nI think if I were in your shoes, when Ryan asked I'd give a vague positive answer like \"yes, John doesn't think there is any stigma about going to therapy, we're so proud of him.  But of course, it's his choice who to talk to about it, and we're respecting that.\"\n\nBut from Ryan's comment\n\n&gt;He said that his son isn't in therapy, so maybe if I told him what was going on he could give me some parenting advice.\n\nI'd probably just be so mad that my best response would be to laugh in disbelief and walk away.",

Unfortunately, around 50% people in the U.S. believe that going to therapy is a sign of weakness or something is wrong. My best advice is to inform your son about these views that his friend\u2019s father has and inform him that therapy isn\u2019t something bad it is a safe place to work through many problems. You sound like a great father don\u2019t let the friend\u2019s dad tell you otherwise. YOU GOT THIS!!",

Ryan and I ran into each other yesterday. He asked me if it is true that John is in therapy. I asked where he heard that, and he said he heard it from Will. I told Ryan that it's not really a topic one ought to be gossiping about, and suggested he relay that to his son.\n\nRyan was offended. He said he wanted to know if there is anything going on with John. I said that regardless of if there is or isn't, it isn't really any of Ryan's business either way. He said there was no reason to be so sensitive about an innocent question. He said that his son isn't in therapy, so maybe if I told him what was going on he could give me some parenting advice.\n\nI was offended and snapped at him that if I need parenting advice, he is the last person in the world I would ask. He said he isn't surprised John has mental problems with such an asshole for a father. I'm really pissed. I wanted to cuss him out, but I didn't. Am I the asshole for not discussing personal family matters with someone that knows nothing about our situation?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

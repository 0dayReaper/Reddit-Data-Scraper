    "postText": "I'm Asian (28F) raised Catholic (but I\u2019ve personally denounced the religion). I have a full-time job near home and have lived with my parents since graduating because it is extremely expensive to move out, so this has been my life.\n\nFor background, here are a few \"incidents\u201d that involved my interactions and experiences hanging out with guys. When I was 15, I crossed paths with a close classmate at the flea market and we shared a hug, where he even lifted me off the ground a few inches since we were surprised to see each other outside of school. I got an earful from my parents about doing something disgraceful and embarrassing them like that in public as a young girl.\n\nAnd then I was in my junior year of college at 23 and I was living in an apartment (that they were paying for, to be fair), a guy friend I made when I worked part-time was graduating the year before I did, and we agreed to hang out at my apartment for pizza and just chat for the rest of the day. Of course, I\u2019m sure you probably have an idea of what this implied: That I obviously invited him over for sex and he accepted (and I didn't even like him in that way at all). The parents gave me another earful in this situation that men only care about sex and, as a single woman in her own apartment, it made me look like a slut/whore, etc. and we should\u2019ve hung out anywhere else. (Valid in its own right, even outside of the religious aspect.)\n\nNow my aunt, who my parents have reconnected with in the past several months comes over for dinner yesterday, she asks if I\u2019m dating. She gets the same answer all other relatives get, which is no. But then she makes a jab at how inappropriate it would be if I got my own place and started inviting guys over when I\u2019m not married yet. I gave her a blank stare and asked her what the hell she was talking about. And she said that my parents (mostly mom) told her about how I used to be so touchy-feely in public with boys and how immature I was to bring that guy friend over to my apartment in college, and how they were all just concerned about my punishment with God if I did the deed before any nuptials.\n\nI was appalled and pissed. In between everyone\u2019s justifications, I sternly told my mom (translating out), \u201cI don\u2019t know why you ever thought it was appropriate to share my teenage idiocies to some woman you barely started talking to. You said whatever happens in this family, stays in this family! Yes, I am ashamed with those actions to a degree, but it never meant you could gossip about it so nonchalantly. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve lost my goddamn appetite.\u201d\n\nAnd I left my unfinished food on the table and left to my room, even slamming the door once I got there. Quite childish, now that I think about it. My aunt didn\u2019t leave until hours later, and my parents came in to reprimand me for my behavior, saying that those incidents are worth bringing up because it will always motivate me to be a more mature woman.\n\nSo, AITA?",

For what it is worth, you are a perfectly normal person and didn\u2019t do anything most other people haven\u2019t also done, religious or not.  I hope you don\u2019t beat yourself up for what you feel are youthful mistakes.

If I understand this correctly, you're older than 23 and as such you should be able to determine your own lifestyle. If I'm right, your base problem may be that you still live at home and feel obligated to follow your parent's rules.\n\nAt some time in the near future, you will have to decide if you consider yourself to be an adult. I do find it good that you seem to show respect for your parents, but at your age they should also start showing you respect in return. They and you should know that you have earned respect in your own right.",

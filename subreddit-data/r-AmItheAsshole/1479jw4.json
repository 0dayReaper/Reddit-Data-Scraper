    "postText": "My brother-in-law is getting married in October. I love his fianc\u00e9, we\u2019ve developed a friendship, I\u2019ve hung out with her a couple times one on one and the 4 of us try to have quarterly dinners. I\u2019m so happy they\u2019re getting married and planed on going to the bachelorette but a lot has changed for me over the past month and now I don\u2019t feel comfortable going. \n\nThe plan was to rent a cottage for the weekend about 3.5-4 hours away minimum. It\u2019s scheduled for the September long weekend here in Canada which is the last weekend of the summer, and requires driving through Toronto to cottage country, so traffic will be worse than normal. If this wasn\u2019t the case, I\u2019d definitely consider a day trip or maybe one night.\n\nMy situation: I have two young kids. I\u2019m currently on maternity leave with my son, returning part time in July, full time in August. We just bought a new house which needs some pretty large scale renovations and we have a month between closing dates to get as much done as we can. We will be fully out of our current house and moved into the new house the week before the trip. I know there will still be a lot to do when that time comes. My daughter starts junior kindergarten the day after the long weekend. New house, new city, new neighbourhood, new school (she\u2019s currently at daycare full time), it\u2019ll be a huge transition for her. She already struggles A LOT with transitions and I was already worried about being away that weekend before we decided to move, so now I\u2019m even more concerned. I feel like I\u2019m going to be burnt out from returning to work and ramping up there, using all my free time to help with the renovations, moving the family and trying to set up our house before the school year starts. I want to ensure my daughter is all settled in before she goes to school and I don\u2019t know if I can successfully make that happen if I\u2019m gone all weekend. \n\nThey were just informed that the air bnb they received was cancelled unexpectedly, so they are searching for new accommodations. Now is a good time for me to say I can\u2019t go, so they can find something without including me in the size and cost of the cottage. Aside from timing, it\u2019s going to be a pretty expensive weekend ($600+) when all is said and done, and though I can make that work, it\u2019s hard to justify when I feel like I\u2019ll be stressed the whole time about everything I\u2019ve got to do at home and with my kids. \n\nMy suture SIL has not been understanding and my BIL is upset. I don\u2019t know if this is relevant but they are younger and at a different point in their lives, so they don\u2019t have kids yet. I feel so guilty considering backing out but I feel even more guilty not being there to help get settled into the new house the 3 days before my daughter starts school and goes through a major life transition. AITA?",

            "comment": "NTA. You have responsibilities which they do not. The logistics of this planned trip (timing, location, cost, etc) simply do not work for you.\n\nIf your SIL and BIL really care for you, and you are all such good friends, they should understand. If they continue to be upset at your very reasonable withdrawal from this trip, I'd be querying whether you're all as close friends as you claim to be.\n\nIf you are genuinely sad about missing this weekend, you can offer to do something with your SIL, just the two of you, another time. A \"girl's day out\" at a spa, or something similar. But if you do this, do it for yourself as much as your SIL. Do it because life has been stressful for you, and you need to unwind. Don't do it because your SIL is upset with you and you think this will mollify her.\n\nA personal anecdote which may illustrate how this sort of thing can be handled in a far more mature manner than your SIL and BIL are handling it:\n\nSomeone I know, \"James\", got married a few years ago. James invited his closest friend \"David\", whom he'd known for almost 50 years, since they were both very young children. They were lifelong best friends, and had been best man at each other's first weddings. Naturally, David desperately wanted to come to the wedding. But he'd already arranged a trip overseas with his wife, so couldn't make it, and (for a reason that became obvious later, but James didn't know at the time) couldn't cancel or postpone the trip.\n\nJames was sad, but understanding. He didn't throw a tantrum, he didn't try to guilt his friend, he didn't demand David cancel his trip. He told David he would be sad not to have him there at the wedding, but wished him a great trip. James and his new wife caught up with David and his wife before the overseas trip, and again after they got back. It didn't affect their friendship in the slightest.\n\nWhat James didn't know at the time, but David and his wife did, is that David had terminal cancer. This trip overseas was the last one David would ever be well enough to take. He ended up telling James he was dying, a year or so before the end, when the treatment wasn't working and he couldn't hide it any more.\n\nJames was naturally devastated, but relieved that he never tried to guilt David into not going on his trip. He behaved impeccably throughout. He was a good, supportive friend. He didn't understand David's reasons at the time, but he accepted they were good reasons. And it gives him great comfort to know that David was able to have one last overseas trip with his wife, and she now has that as a lasting memory.\n\nYour SIL and BIL need to accept your reasons even if they don't understand or agree with them.",

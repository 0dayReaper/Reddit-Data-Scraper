    "postText": "i (19f) asked my mom if i could sleep over at my friends house last night and do their nails( i\u2019m studying to be a nail tech). she said yes but i got to my friends house kinda late since we like doing nail art and they let me practice things i haven\u2019t done before. After dinner we decided to just put off the nails until the next day and just watch movies and hang out for the rest of the night. Today we woke up at around 10\nate breakfast and i started doing her nails around 11. i finished around 5 (we stopped half way through to eat lunch). My mom texted me at 1 asking when i would be home and i told her i wasn\u2019t sure since i was doing my friends nails. she said ok. My friends parents insisted i stay for dinner so i did. After dinner i didn\u2019t really want to go home yet so i watched a movie with my friend and we filmed a tiktok and at 9 i told them i should go home. My mom texted me asking when i would be home again when i was leaving and i told her i was on my way. When i got home she told me that if i thought my actions were correct and that spending the day all day at someone else\u2019s house isn\u2019t okay. She was like you know where you are but you don\u2019t keep me updated i don\u2019t know where you were (she has my location and my friend lives not even 2 miles away from my house). I told her i was sorry and she said that i do whatever i want and don\u2019t care about anyone else. She also told me that my dad was mad at me too because i didn\u2019t ask permission to stay at my friends longer. She said you asked to spend the night at your friends and i expected you to be home at like 10-11 am i said i was sorry again she she just kept saying how awful i am. Previous times i\u2019ve slept over i get home at like 1pm and my parents always say you\u2019re back already? so i assumed it would be fine if i stayed longer today sorry if this story is kinda lame and boring i just feel like an awful daughter right now",

Children ask for permission, if you act like a kid still it's going to be even harder for them to treat you like an adult.

It is a tough transition, being 100% responsible for someone\u2019s every whim and whereabouts to your last child entering adulthood. This is one of those feelings that is really hard to explain to someone who is not a parent. \n\nYou mentioned later on that you usually eat separately. Are you eating groceries that you buy and prepare, or are you coming home to a plate of leftovers from what your mom prepared? \n\nI get that they don\u2019t want you to \u201ccontribute\u201d financially: it sounds like they want you to focus on school/learning. But with them footing the bill for all of this, I think it\u2019s a matter of respect that you abide by the rules.

The fact that it even bothered you to begin with and sought neutral opinion speaks volumes. \n\nAs a parent, I think that it\u2019s hard because with my kids, though they\u2019re nearly grown\u2026it\u2019s hard to discern that \u201cline\u201d of adult vs child. We still see the toddler, the newborn, but we also see the person our child is growing into, no matter what stage of life. It\u2019s beautiful and damning all at the same time.",

I know they still see me as their baby (they don\u2019t forget to remind me when they\u2019re not mad at me) especially since i\u2019m their youngest child. I feel like telling them otherwise would crush them\u2026 even though it\u2019s only slightly degrading. I genuinely love my parents. Recently i\u2019ve just had a strained relationship with my mom specifically but that\u2019s unrelated and we don\u2019t need to get into that. I\u2019ll definitely try to talk to her more even if it\u2019s a little scary lol.",

I experienced a strained maternal relationship, but for exact opposite reasons. As long as you can understand that her reactions are most likely coming from a place of love, then you are set. I was the middle child so I didn\u2019t have the stress of being the youngest, being the one that emptied the nest\u2014those are big shoes to fill. It\u2019s not your battle, but at least being able to see and acknowledge the psychological impact from it on your mom will help you be more prepared for the \u201cwhy\u201d, even if she isn\u2019t able to put it into words.",

It\u2019s one of those things that I wish I knew when I was younger\u2014then maybe those strained relationships I had then wouldn\u2019t have taken so long to rebloom! \n\nI hope that my children turn out to be even half as respectful and empathetic as you. Your parents have done a great job, and you\u2019re doing an awesome job!

But they can just call/text and ask you if they don\u2019t have the information they need, or tell you they want you to come home, rather than expect you to read their minds about how much they want to know or what they expect you to do. You\u2019re 19, plus you told them where you were going and you were basically doing school work most of the time so I don\u2019t get their reactions at all. \n\nIs the friend or their parents sketchy in some way or do they think they\u2019re a bad influence or something? Or do you have a disability or medical condition that makes you more vulnerable? Or were you recently in significant trouble? If not, your parents just seem very overly anxious or something.",

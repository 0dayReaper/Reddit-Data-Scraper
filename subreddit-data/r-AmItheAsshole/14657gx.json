    "postText": "I (22F) am a college jr who doesn't have experience w/ credit cards, but I applied for some in May to temporarily aid in making 2 payments I have in my student acct. I got approved for one from Discover &amp; the other from BoA, which I don't bank w/. Bc of the disorganization in my dorm's mailroom, I so far only received my BoA cc just Thursday.\n\nI attempted to activate it through the BoA app &amp; register for an acct, but it notified me my SSN was already connected to an acct which then reminded me of the ones my uncle (50s) created for me &amp; my sister in 2018, I was 17, &amp; she was 15 then. My sister &amp; I both had our own joint bank accts w/ him so he could give us \"allowances\" which never happened &amp; he then asked for the debit cards back after he &amp; our mom fell out, claiming he was \"closing the accts\". So, from 2018 to now, I've never used or even been inside my BoA joint acct.\n\nI got in after accessing my old email &amp; resetting the BoA pw, &amp; saw $0.35 in the checking acct. It was odd to me since I've *never* used it &amp; *figured* he had long closed it. Going through the transaction history, I saw that he was transferring considerable amounts of money in &amp; out of the acct to (an)other acct(s), &amp; various ATM transactions, w/ his last transaction being this April.\n\nWhen bringing up it &amp; my financial issues otp, asking him if me activating my cc would affect *whatever* he's doing in the checking acct (since I don't bank w/ BoA or know anything about ccs), he acted clueless about the transactions, before talking about going to the bank the next day &amp; telling me to ask my sister if she was available, &amp; then got upset w/ me &amp; asked how long I had \"known about this,\" (whatever *\"this\"* even is) &amp; how did I gain access to the acct. I explained I just found out about it that day, &amp; that bc my cc &amp; the joint acct are linked to my SSN, that's how I gained access to it after logging in. He then circled back, asking me if my sister could come to the bank w/ us the next day &amp; got off the phone.\n\nThat night, I spoke to my sister about it, she was upset, &amp; said she didn't want to go to the bank w/ him &amp; was busy anyway. After our call, I texted him that she would be busy the next day to which he didn't respond.\n\nYesterday, aka the next day, I went to BoA, spoke to a banker &amp; explained the ordeal to her. She asked if I wanted to close the acct since I can't remove myself bc both parties weren't present. I was honestly hesitant to do so bc I don't want to be on the receiving end of my uncle's rage since he does have anger problems &amp; has physically abused women in the past, but despite my fears, I chose to close the acct anyway bc I have no idea what he's even doing w/ it, especially w/ it attached to my SSN.\n\nLast night, I received a call from him &amp; didn't answer, &amp; then received a text immediately after, telling me to call him back &amp; asking me if I closed the acct -- he keeps calling &amp; I still haven't responded bc I am afraid of him tbh.\n\nAITA for closing it w/o even consulting him first?",

I realize it's using money you may not have but it looks like some transactions were carried out in your name AND YOU WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL TAX REPERCUSSIONS. I don't want to be an alarmist so I won't elaborate but you MUST protect yourself and your future.\n\nAlso get your credit report from  AnnualCreditReport.com (it's free and the only one authorized by the government) and see if there's activity you don't recognize. If there is contact the creditors, and, if it's your uncle who pulled this, CONTACT THE POLICE. Is he taking credit in your name? Is he defaulting on that credit?\n\nYour future self will thank you.\n\nObviously NTA. That would be your uncle!\n\nAnd please do not, under any circumstances, make contact with your uncle. Keep all the messages he sends you and your family but DO NOT REPLY. If it gets threatening contact the police.",

Banks got fined a few hundred millions of euros for not doing this to the extend they are supposed to under a new law. So they do it now. I have seen people in my criminal justice system who let others use their bank accounts and they got jailtime for it. Sometimes people told the judges they didn\u2019t know about it, but if it\u2019s connected to your social security number then you are probably going to be held responsible unless you can make clear you literally didn\u2019t know anything about it.",

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (22F) am a college jr who doesn't have experience w/ credit cards, but I applied for some in May to temporarily aid in making 2 payments I have in my student acct. I got approved for one from Discover &amp; the other from BoA, which I don't bank w/. Bc of the disorganization in my dorm's mailroom, I so far only received my BoA cc just Thursday. \n\nI attempted to activate it through the BoA app &amp; register for an acct, but it notified me my SSN was already connected to an acct which then reminded me of the ones my uncle (50s) created for me &amp; my sister in 2018, I was 17, &amp; she was 15 then. My sister &amp; I both had our own joint bank accts w/ him so he could give us \"allowances\" which never happened &amp; he then asked for the debit cards back after he &amp; our mom fell out, claiming he was \"closing the accts\". So, from 2018 to now, I've never used or even been inside my BoA joint acct.\n\nI got in after accessing my old email &amp; resetting the BoA pw, &amp; saw $0.35 in the checking acct. It was odd to me since I've *never* used it &amp; *figured* he had long closed it. Going through the transaction history &amp; saw that he was transferring considerable amounts of money in &amp; out of the acct to (an)other acct(s), &amp; various ATM transactions, w/ his last transaction being this April.\n\nWhen bringing up it &amp; my financial issues otp, asking him if me activating my cc would affect *whatever* he's doing in the checking acct (since I don't bank w/ BoA or know anything about ccs), he acted clueless about the transactions, before talking about going to the bank the next day &amp; telling me to ask my sister if she was available, &amp; then got upset w/ me &amp; asked how long I had \"known about this,\" (whatever *\"this\"* even is) &amp; how did I gain access to the acct. I explained I just found out about it that day, &amp; that bc my cc &amp; the joint acct are linked to my SSN, that's how I gained access to it after logging in. He then circled back, asking me if my sister could come to the bank w/ us the next day &amp; got off the phone. \n\nThat night, I spoke to my sister about it, she was upset, &amp; said she didn't want to go to the bank w/ him &amp; was busy anyway. After our call, I texted him that she would be busy the next day to which he didn't respond.\n\nYesterday, aka the next day, I went to BoA, spoke to a banker &amp; explained the ordeal to her. She asked if I wanted to close the acct since I can't remove myself bc both parties weren't present. I was honestly hesitant to do so bc I don't want to be on the receiving end of my uncle's rage since he does have anger problems &amp; has physically abused women in the past, but despite my fears, I chose to close the acct anyway bc I have no idea what he's even doing w/ it, especially w/ it attached to my SSN. \n\nLast night, I received a call from him &amp; didn't answer, &amp; then received a text immediately after, telling me to call him back &amp; asking me if I closed the acct -- he keeps calling &amp; I still haven't responded bc I am afraid of him tbh. \n\nAITA for closing the w/o even consulting him first? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Text him back and tell him yes you closed it because it left you financially liable on an account that you had nothing to do with.  \nGet with all 3 credit agencies and put a credit freeze on all 3 credit reports.  Get with the IRS or a good tax guy and pull all of  your previous tax returns and do the same next year.   See if there is something they can do to help you.",

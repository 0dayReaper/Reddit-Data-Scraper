    "postText": "Hey, so, I suggested we get away for a couple days. I\u2019m taking some time off work for this as well as she said her schedule is difficult to change (mine was a bit of a hassle too but I conceded). \n\nNow we are going to be taking the ferry to a nearby island. The ferries are closer to my house than hers. I offered to drive. The drive to the ferries is half hour away from my home. Then, there is an hour and a half drive at the island to the air bnb. \n\nShe is upset because instead of picking her up at her home which would entail a 45 minute drive from my place to hers in traffic (which tires me out quite a bit and isn\u2019t an enjoyable experience) followed by us going back towards my place and to the ferries, I suggested she can park her car by my house or take public transit and I can pick her up there. \n\nAm I the asshole? I thought my suggestion wasn\u2019t unreasonable at all and that it would just help me with driving fatigue if she can come over my way before we embark together. \n\nI asked 3 friends. 1 said it\u2019s not unreasonable. The other 2 said it\u2019s not unreasonable but in a relationship, I should be picking her up even if it\u2019s out of the way. \n\nI feel bad now, because I made her feel bad by not offering to pick her up :( Her texts have been without emojis and fun since then, and communication has lessened. She hasn\u2019t picked up my calls, nor returned them. \n\nI offered to pick her up after I spoke with my friends and got their opinions but she\u2019s adamant on getting dropped off now. \n\nShe had made a comment before about her friends bf drives 1 hour to pick her up, and then 2 hours back towards his house to go downtown, and then drops her off again for a 3 hour return drive to her house, followed by a 1 hour return to his house. But I can\u2019t drive that much\u2026 gas isn\u2019t cheap and that sound very tiring to me. \n\nBut I\u2019m a noob when it comes to relationships. Should I feel bad? Am\nI the asshole here?? \n\nAll opinions welcome please.",

    "postText": "Background info: My (35F) father-in-law (78M) has alcoholic dementia. He has limited speech and mobility and is such a fall risk that at home he wears a bracelet that connects to an outside company who will come help him up when he falls as my mother-in-law (73F) is not always capable of helping him up. He is unable to communicate clearly, has trouble knowing what age he is, what year it is or even the difference between yes and no. The government pays for respite care for him to give MIL a break a few times a year.   \n\n\nHe was placed in respite care this last week on Monday, and on Tuesday, he had a fall in the dining room at the care home and hurt his leg. The care home put him in a seat in his room and asked him if he was ok, he kept saying he had a sore leg and was unable to walk at all. On Wednesday when my MIL visited, they said they \"were thinking\" that if it persisted, they'd take him to hospital. By Friday it had not improved and the care home called for an ambulance but as it was non-emergency, it would have been hours before one could be dispatched, so they gave my MIL a wheelchair and a carer to  WALK HIM to the hospital, approximately 1 mile away. At the hospital, it was discovered he'd broken his hip and required urgent surgery to fix it and may be in for weeks or months until he can be sent safely home.\n\nI am really disgusted and outraged at the complete lack of care given to my FIL during his respite. I'd like to make a formal complaint to address a number of issues that should never have come up at all - he should not have been walking unsupervised, he should have been offered medical attention immediately and he most certainly shouldn't have had to been walked to the hospital! It turns out the home in question was at risk of being closed 12 months ago as they were not washing patients, leaving them in soiled incontinence pads and had poor cleaning all round. I can't stop crying at how much pain the poor man must have been in. \n\nMy MIL is resistant to making a complaint completely as she thinks the care home acted accordingly. She believes that its her husbands \"fault\" as he falls regularly and didn't tell the care home staff how much pain he was in (despite knowing he has limited speech and is unable to communicate clearly) so how could they have known to have him treated? It's also not their fault about the ambulance wait times, they did the best they could under the circumstances. She'd rather I just let this all go.  \n\n\nAm I being too harsh? My feelings come down to two main thoughts - the treatment of my FIL, who deserved better, and the treatment of patients both now and in the future - I don't believe he was just unfortunate enough to be an isolated incident.",

            "comment": "The care home most certainly violated strict state regulations on care and were quite negligent. You should absolutely file a complaint with the state (assuming you are in the States). Regardless of your MIL's feelings, this is a safety issue for future residents. \n\nI am also a bit concerned about your MIL's attitude. There is a good chance she is burnt out on caring for your FIL. It is very draining work. And she may also feel as if filing a complaint will remove the one option for respite care, which she likely desperately needs. Please consider helping her find another option so that she does not become callous to your FIL's needs, which is a natural result of carer burn-out.",

Your Mom is probably going to have to sue, but you can convince her to.  This is horrific elder abuse.  \n\nShe probably thinks she won't have their help if she complains.  She's probably desperate for that help and doesn't want to jeopardize it.  Let an attorney tell her straight facts and she'll realize she will be better off suing.",

Report to adult protective services and the office of inspector general that investigates nursing homes (if in the US). Both entities will determine not only if the facility was at fault but if a particular staff was negligent. This can force them to change policies and procedures for how they handle falls, result in a citation, or as you mentioned, possible closure if they are that bad. Can\u2019t speak for other countries if you are located elsewhere but there should be government entities you can report to or social services as well.",

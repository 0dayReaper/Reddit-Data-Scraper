    "postText": "I want to sincerely thank everyone who commented. Everyone\u2019s comments were appreciated, including those that were less than pleasant. \n\nSince I received such great advice on my original post, I felt like I had an obligation to update. And I\u2019m trying to follow through on all aspects of my life, even internet ones. \n\nThe funeral service was held this past Thursday. Before then, I brought all the advice I received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how I was feeling and what I should do. \n\nMy sponsor was straight with me and told me that I would be putting myself in danger by going and that I should do something else that day to grieve. \n\nWhen Thursday rolled around, I was a mess. I seriously considered both just going to the funeral or using again but instead I grabbed my dog and we went on a road trip. \n\nWe went to the beach and just hung out the two of us. \n\nI\u2019m doing okay this week, but obviously am still not doing great. \n\nI haven\u2019t reached out to any of Marcy\u2019s family and I don\u2019t plan to. I understand now how devastating that would be. \n\nThat\u2019s it. Take care everyone.",

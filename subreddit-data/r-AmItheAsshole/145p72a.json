    "postText": "My mother (42f) is having her friend (42f) and her mother (60 something f) and kid (3m) stay over for 2 nights. I (16f) has been told by my mother that I and my brother (14m) have to give up our beds for them, because we are younger than them. We have 2 spare beds, (a double and a single) but we have to give up ours because they are bigger (queens). I have refused to give up my bed because we have spare beds for guests, and I find it ridiculous that I have to give up my bed. Also the friends mum would be sleeping in my room, I don\u2019t even know her that well, but she is a Christian, and it might be petty of me, but as a gay teenager who has PTSD related to the Christian church, I am refusing to let her even be in my room. My mother will not talk to me, unless she is berating me calling me selfish and entitled. I would like to know if I am the asshole?",

The internet promoted selfishness works great online - because you never have to actually function as a society. It does not work well in practice. In the normal world your parents aren\u2019t asking for anything abnormal. \n\nWhen you get your own place you can choose who you invite into it. For now you live in your parents\u2019 home - and they can welcome their friends and family. \n\nI hate Christians is actually not a good reason to refuse hospitality. If the presence of a Christian in your house is unsafe for you speak with your medical professional about their reading of the situation. If they support you that it is unsafe - then the situation is very different to you not liking Christians (a population of more than 2 billion people at a quick Google). PTSD is a serious medical condition - but it feels like an excuse here rather than a reason. I\u2019m definitely not an expert - but it feels odd that this trigger is linked to the presence of a spare bed.",

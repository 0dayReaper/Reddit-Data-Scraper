Part of getting a dog is changing your life so you can deal with issues like this, not demand your kids take care of a pet that isn't theirs. If they don't want to put him down when he sounds ill and miserable, then they shouldn't get to treat him like a doll they can leave on a whim.",

It is time for either your brother to take a turn taking on this task for the long weekend, or for your parents to **develop a good relationship with a trusted dog-sitter who they will pay handsomely** to stay the entire weekend, get to know George and be able to come on weekends when you and your brother are unavailable. \n\nIf this were a one-time thing, I would say you should watch George. But this is a very labor-intensive task that disrupts your sleep and they are asking you to give up your entire weekends multiple times per month, so I think this is overstepping at this point and they need to make contacts with dogsitters and find some people they trust and can leave George with.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (26 F) was asked by my mom to watch my parent\u2019s dog, George (fake name) next weekend. George is 14 years old and has developed severe separation anxiety within the last 2 years. He also has GI issues and trouble with his joints/getting around and going up and down steps. He has a very hard time when my parents leave even to go run errands. He sits at the door and barks and cannot tolerate being in the car either, he shakes and barks the entire ride. George is on 2 different prescription anxiety medications currently, as well as joint supplements and GI medications, which makes it difficult to feed him. My parents crush up the pills and put them on his food which he refuses to eat. \n\nMy brother, Fred (also fake name) who still lives at home with my parents, originally agreed to watching George for the weekend. Fred has now last minute decided to go to the beach with his friends that weekend and so now my mom needs to find another sitter for Friday and Saturday night. I live 2 hours away and don\u2019t really have any plans that weekend, but am hesitant to agreeing to watch the dog giving my last experience watching him.\nI dog-sat last weekend while my parents went to an air show (I got them tickets for my dad\u2019s birthday and agreed to watch the dog while they enjoyed the weekend.) I spent 2 hours trying to get him to eat each of 3 scheduled meals and 2 scheduled snacks per day (my mom said the timing of the medications is very important, so making sure he ate each meal on time was also important). I was literally sitting on the floor, spoon feeding him and petting him and speaking calmly to him to get him to eat. He barked throughout the night, leading to get very little sleep. I took him out at 1am and 3am and woke up to him about to throw up at 6am. I ran with him to get him on hardwood (he was leaning over a bin of magazines in a carpeted room). I tripped and fell (being a clumsy confused idiot in my half awake state of mind) and landed hard on my knee that still feels messed up a week later. After cleaning up his throw up, he continued barking for 2 hours straight from 7-9am (again no sleep)\nI really don\u2019t feel like dog sitting again this month, especially given my very negative experience last weekend. I work full time and am very sleep sensitive. My parents are retired and want to see their friends next weekend. My mom is very picky about sitters giving George\u2019s medical history and I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019d have a backup sitter option. I feel guilty because I would hate to be the reason my parents can\u2019t spend the weekend with their friends, but I really use my weekends as my recharge time (currently in a rough work situation, working 2 caseloads) and am worried about getting no sleep or time to relax and recharge before beginning the next work week. So Reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Beyond that, his anxiety must've been through the roof to vomit, so in reality your parents should keep the dog home. Brother can watch the dog, and reschedule his beach trip. This old, paranoid,  and skittish dog needs to stay home with him. The only other alternative is you watch the dog in your parent's house, but realistically I'd get on your brother to stay home.",

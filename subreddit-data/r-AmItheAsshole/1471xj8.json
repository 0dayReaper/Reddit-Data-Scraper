    "postText": "I recently had a baby, and I found out my husband was cheating with a woman he works with. Im comfortable believing it was only messages. We decided to do marriage counseling and talked about moving closer to his family for more support with our 3 kids. \n\nMy family doesn\u2019t help us much and his family is very willing to spend time with our kids for any reason. We decided TOGETHER that we would like to move, for us and our kids we think it\u2019s the best option whether we stay together or not. \n\nMy family has watched my kids for us but only for scheduled appointments. My mom and step dad run their own business and make their own work schedule. My sister works day shift M-F. When I ask my mom if she can watch them very well in advance I get a \u201cwell I don\u2019t know I\u2019ll have to see\u201d. My sister is willing to watch them when she\u2019s not working but she drinks and is usually very drunk and half asleep when I get back. I have two brothers that live around but they aren\u2019t interested in helping. I have no other family around. \n\nWe own a duplex and my sister lives upstairs. My mom takes her to and from work every day and will go inside with her after work. Neither of them come to see my kids or myself very often. \n\nMy mom and step dad live in a camper that sits inside of the shop they work out of. So space is tight and it\u2019s really not a kid friendly place. On top of that it\u2019s really hard for me to be around my mom and step dad together because she is lying to him about where we live and the fact that I got married. (No he was not at my wedding because she asked me not to mention it. She said she was going to be separated from him by the time we were married) \n\nI told my mom about moving she got very upset with me and insisted he was trying to isolate me from my family and called him a narcissist. I told her it wasn\u2019t true and explained that we need more help with the kids and would like for them to be around family more often. He had had an interview, got the job, and I told her we were moving. \n\nMy mom messaged and said \u201cso that\u2019s the decision you made then?\u201d And I responded that yes, it is and told her again we want the kids around family and we need help with them. She responded with she heard me tell them not to open my door for her and not to unlock it. Those words have never, ever left my mouth and I wouldn\u2019t refuse to let her come and see the kids even if I wasn\u2019t feeling up to socializing. I\u2019ve told her and my sister both they are welcome to come in whenever they want and to just come inside. She switched it up on me and said it\u2019s just an awkward time of the day and she doesn\u2019t want to be intrusive. \n\nSo I\u2019m left feeling guilty about leaving but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m wrong for doing so.",

Use your best judgement about what would be right for you! I'm 900 miles from my parents and have been since my son was 9. They were less safe than the friends I have here that were designated as okay to pick K up from school and had notorized medical guardianship to sign off on emergency care or just a dentist appointment. \n\nJust remember to cultivate new friendships if you can - sometimes friends are super willing to help out, sometimes they're not, but it never hurts to check.",

Im comfortable believing it was only messages. We decided to do marriage counseling and talked about moving closer to his family for more support with our 3 kids. \n\nMy family doesn\u2019t help us much and his family is very willing to spend time with our kids for any reason. We decided TOGETHER that we would like to move, for us and our kids we think it\u2019s the best option whether we stay together or not. \n\nMy family has watched my kids for us but only for scheduled appointments. My mom and step dad run their own business and make their own work schedule. My sister works day shift M-F. When I ask my mom if she can watch them very well in advance I get a \u201cwell I don\u2019t know I\u2019ll have to see\u201d. My sister is willing to watch them when she\u2019s not working but she drinks and is usually very drunk and half asleep when I get back. I have two brothers that live around but they aren\u2019t interested in helping. I have no other family around. \n\nWe own a duplex and my sister lives upstairs. My mom takes her to and from work every day and will go inside with her after work. Neither of them come to see my kids or myself very often. \n\nMy mom and step dad live in a camper that sits inside of the shop they work out of. So space is tight and it\u2019s really not a kid friendly place. On top of that it\u2019s really hard for me to be around my mom and step dad together because she is lying to him about where we live and the fact that I got married. (No he was not at my wedding because she asked me not to mention it. She said she was going to be separated from him by the time we were married) \n\nI told my mom about moving she got very upset with me and insisted he was trying to isolate me from my family and called him a narcissist. I told her it wasn\u2019t true and explained that we need more help with the kids and would like for them to be around family more often. He had had an interview, got the job, and I told her we were moving. \n\nMy mom messaged and said \u201cso that\u2019s the decision you made then?\u201d And I responded that yes, it is and told her again we want the kids around family and we need help with them. She responded with she heard me tell them not to open my door for her and not to unlock it. Those words have never, ever left my mouth and I wouldn\u2019t refuse to let her come and see the kids even if I wasn\u2019t feeling up to socializing. I\u2019ve told her and my sister both they are welcome to come in whenever they want and to just come inside. She switched it up on me and said it\u2019s just an awkward time of the day and she doesn\u2019t want to be intrusive. \n\nSo I\u2019m left feeling guilty about leaving but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m wrong for doing so.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "postText": "I know the question may sound bad but here is the context.\n\n I ( f20) have a (1f) toddler. We live with my mom ( due to college, working, and her wanting to be primary childcare while I\u2019m away) and she\u2019s honestly a god send, but lately we\u2019ve been having a disagreement on my daughters eating routine. Basically whenever I just want to eat or have a little snack my mom believes I should give some of whatever I\u2019m eating to my daughter or eat away from her eyesight. I NEVER eat in front of my daughter without feeding her IF she\u2019s hungry. One instance was the three of us were out and about and stopped at a chicken place, baby was already fed and nearly sleep. I got chicken strips and began to eat when my mom said \u201c aren\u2019t you going to give ( baby) some?\u201d I said no, as she\u2019s already eaten. My mom then goes on a rent about how she taught me to have manners and to share. I told her that ( baby) doesn\u2019t need to eat every single time I do if she\u2019s already eaten and that she probably doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019m eating anyway. Mom then goes and feeds baby some of her food. This is now starting a problem because now my daughter is starting to fuss if she sees you eating and you don\u2019t give her any ( even when full) . My mom insists it\u2019s because she\u2019s \u201c still hungry \u201c but I know that isn\u2019t the case because if you ignore her long enough she\u2019ll continue to play or whatever ( also she not crying, just making noise) I told my mom to stop feeding her if she isn\u2019t hungry, and she said that she refuses to eat around baby if she can\u2019t give her some because it\u2019s \u201c rude\u201d and \u201c cruel\u201d . So Reddit, AITA for not feeding my daughter every time I eat?",

Like fried chicken stripes, they are a bit too much fat and too salty for babies and toddlers. Salt can damage a baby and toddler real bad. Babies aren\u2019t allowed to have salty food like cheese for a reason. Or foods like honey. So it\u2019s child abuse to feed a child too much AND sometimes also dangerous. NTA.",

We live with my mom ( due to college, working, and her wanting to be primary childcare while I\u2019m away) and she\u2019s honestly a god send, but lately we\u2019ve been having a disagreement on my daughters eating routine. Basically whenever I just want to eat or have a little snack my mom believes I should give some of whatever I\u2019m eating to my daughter or eat away from her eyesight. I NEVER eat in front of my daughter without feeding her IF she\u2019s hungry. One instance was the three of us were out and about and stopped at a chicken place, baby was already fed and nearly sleep. I got chicken strips and began to eat when my mom said \u201c aren\u2019t you going to give ( baby) some?\u201d I said no, as she\u2019s already eaten. My mom then goes on a rent about how she taught me to have manners and to share. I told her that ( baby) doesn\u2019t need to eat every single time I do if she\u2019s already eaten and that she probably doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019m eating anyway. Mom then goes and feeds baby some of her food. This is now starting a problem because now my daughter is starting to fuss if she sees you eating and you don\u2019t give her any ( even when full) . My mom insists it\u2019s because she\u2019s \u201c still hungry \u201c but I know that isn\u2019t the case because if you ignore her long enough she\u2019ll continue to play or whatever ( also she not crying, just making noise) I told my mom to stop feeding her if she isn\u2019t hungry, and she said that she refuses to eat around baby if she can\u2019t give her some because it\u2019s \u201c rude\u201d and \u201c cruel\u201d . So Reddit, AITA for not feeding my daughter every time I eat?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We grown folks find it delicious but we also outweigh the kiddo by at least 100 pounds. So it is not always good for the baby to eat what the grownups eat. Some foods are just not for kids.

Lots of hurt, some on my end, but the majority on my end is a direct response to her actions towards me.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother source of contention is that she has lied for nearly 20 years about what she said to me after I told her our pastor was abusing me. She said that she didn't believe me, and kept on saying that for months, until she had a conversation with said pastor several months after I told her about him abusing me in which he said that if I wanted him to step down, then he would--that struck her as strange. She didn't come around to believe me because of anything I had said; she did so because the asshole finally admitted it.

Even though I had tried my best to find anyone but her to take me to surgery, that other ride fell through at the last moment, and so I had no one else to ask. Also, postponing this surgery again wasn't an option (it had been postponed for me to get a couple of medical clearances). I even went to bed with the attitude of trying to make the best of this situation I didn't want to be in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I was being wheeled into my room after surgery, she was there, and started asking a bunch of questions while I was still groggy from anesthesia and in a lot of pain, and I was only really able to answer in grunts... also other medical professionals were working on me at the same time. She took issue with that, said that she took that as me being aggravated at her for asking simple questions about what I needed from the car, etc. Once she did bring up part of what I needed (and ignored texts when I asked about the other things I needed), she went to check into the hotel (hospital was a few hour away from home, the hotel was about 5 minutes away), and I texted her that I had everything handled and that I'd see her in the morning.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo say she lost her shit would be, again, an understatement. When I reminded her of her shitty attitude towards bringing stuff to me during my last hospital stay a couple months ago; basically, she wasn't getting what I asked her to, only what she thought I needed... and so I said that I know better than her what I needed, and she tried to lay on the guilt trip of her doing a big favor for me. Yesterday, she said I lied about that when I mentioned it, and that's when I responded with if she truly believed that I would lie about that, I didn't want her here, there, or anywhere, and I also reminded her that with her history of not believing me about important stuff, she had absolutely no room to accuse me of lying. Of course, that makes me a drama queen who constantly throws up her bad behavior in her face (I don't... at least not since she stopped going to the church that I was abused in, about 4 years ago, the same church she didn't believe that I was abused in at first).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's so much more I could put in here but am not due to brevity\u2019s sake.\u00a0",

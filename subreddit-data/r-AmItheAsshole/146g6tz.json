It\u2019s not your fault they didn\u2019t listen when you said you were gay and not interested. You have every right to go to prom with whoever you want, and in this case, you went with someone you had a closer relationship with. Emily and Sarah need to respect that and move on. Plus, it\u2019s not their place to out Joey. They need to keep their mouths shut if they don\u2019t want to cause more issues.",

            "comment": "So the female twins can share a gay boy with each other but they draw the line at him being with their \u2018age-appropriate and closer to him, brother?\nThat doesn\u2019t make sense\n\nAlso you should never feel bad about rejecting someone if you\u2019re not interested. They are old enough to know they can\u2019t claim people and definitely old enough to realise that harassing you for not liking them is sexual harassment and a crime. The rules of society dont not apply because you\u2019re a teen and have a crush. What they did is creepy and also very common amongst teenage girls. Along with stalking, claiming and insulting the person they likes crush.\nIts not okay but it hasn\u2019t been talked about when people bring up sexual harassment. \nWe let it go because their teenagers and girls and therefore harmless but you just have to see how they react to their fave male singing dating to know that they are extremely dangerous.\n\nWhat they are doing isn\u2019t okay and you need to get their brother and maybe you to explain how messed up their actions are and how disgusting it is that they think that they had any right to claim you and to then try guilt you into changing your mind. And if they out him, I don\u2019t care how young they are- id suggest never speaking to them again or outing them for outing their brother.\nThey are being creepy and weird.\nIm sure at this point they have made you feel as uncomfortable and objectified as I do when a man refuses no for an answer and gets aggressive \nNta \nNta\nNta",

I was never attracted to women and I never will be. I\u2019m out but I guess the twins didn\u2019t know because they\u2019re in the grade below me and I was outed in middle school, when they were still in elementary school. For story purposes I\u2019ll call them Emily and Sarah. Their brother, who I\u2019ll call Joey, is 17 and in the grade above me.\n\nOn the last day of school after our final exam, they both said they had a crush on me and they had since I started hanging out with Joey and they didn\u2019t know how to tell me without making it awkward. I told them I wasn\u2019t interested and it would be weird for me to date one of them since I was so close to Joey. They told me to think about it. They wouldn\u2019t listen when I said I was gay so I said I would.\n\nJoey and I were planning on going to prom together, which was tonight, but jus as friends. Last night he was staying the night at my house and he asked if I would want to go as a date instead. I said yes, obviously.\n\nWe went to prom and everything was great. We ended up leaving early to go make-out in the bathrooms and eventually left the venue all together, I go to a smaller school (the graduating class is 50) and it was honestly kinda lame lol. I\u2019m spending tonight at Joey\u2019s house but we might go to mine later if his sisters don\u2019t leave us alone soon. Our school lets everyone go to prom but they also have a senior dance a couple weeks before school gets out.\n\nWe had told a couple of our friends we were there as a date because Joey was out to them. Obviously we didn\u2019t board cast it since he\u2019s not out but somehow his sisters found out. They had gotten super upset and said he was stealing me from them like he always had when I was never theirs to begin with. \n\nSarah gave up about an hour ago when she walked in on us cuddling on his bed. She apologized and tried to tell Emily but she won\u2019t listen and is calling me an asshole for getting with their brother after they had expressed interest and waiting that long when I only waited because I thought Joey was straight. I\u2019m more scared that they\u2019ll tell his parents than anything they could do. They aren\u2019t homophobic or anything but he isn\u2019t ready to come out yet.\n\nJoey is asleep while I\u2019m writing this but he seems really stressed out and is saying that this might not work because of his sisters. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

His sisters must be touched because they sure aren\u2019t smart. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe girls anything just because you have a penis. \n\nTry not to feed into the stress of it all and tell Joey you\u2019ll go as slow and private as he he\u2019s comfortable with but tell him if his sisters are going to out him, they\u2019re going to do it regardless of you at this point.\n\nAlso his sisters are extremely homophobic even if they aren\u2019t hateful. If they don\u2019t take you seriously and think you can just \u201creconsider\u201d them instead - that\u2019s still homophobic. This is not a choice. Even if you were straight, you wouldn\u2019t have to like either twin *just because they said they like you first*.\n\nThese girls sound dumb and a little trashy to be honest.",

So if someone says something about paying during the meal the polite response is \"Don't worry about it- this is on me.\" Unless they're trying to buy a $190 T Bone with sides for three people for one teenager, but that's for another post.",

You're young, it's your first big promotion so that's new and the financial transition in your parent relationship is often a little awkward. Send her an email thanking her again for coming out to celebrate and apologize for being caught off guard when she offered to pay and ask if you can treat next time. \n\n\nNow I gotta say.... In most families this would be a nothing blip. The fact that she was sobbing uncontrollably? That's real weird. That your dad told you to make you feel bad? That's really weird. That you know her well enough to know that she's going to make your next call awkward? That's really weird. If it turns out that your mom is weird and financially controlling, then REALLY don't worry about it. Read up on narcissistic parents and personality disorders - this might be the tip (har) of the iceberg.",

I got a $40,000 raise and moved to a better place. \n\nI invited my parents to celebrate with me at a fancy dinner.\nWhile we were eating, my mom sent me a text. It said, \"Don't worry about the cost. I'm just having a drink and I'll pay for it \ud83d\ude0e.\" I asked her out loud if she wanted to pay me back with an app called Venmo.\n\nSuddenly, everything went wrong. Mom got upset, thinking I wanted her to pay for everything. I told her I misunderstood her text, but she still paid me for the whole meal. Then she left with my dad.\n\nThe next day, I found out that my health insurance was changing. They said I wouldn't be covered any longer and to find my own plan. I have epilepsy so this really sucks.\n\nI tried to explain I misinterpreted her text during the meal, but she venmo\u2019d me and she and my father left me with the bill at the table.\n\nI asked her, \u201care you sure you want to pay?\u201d, but that backfired so hard and caused all this. Apparently she cried the whole way home according to my father. \n\n(I rewrote this since half my comments said I wrote the last one horribly)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That's a complete dick move on her part. Don't wait for her to call, don't explain. You already said it was a misunderstanding; if that's not good enough for them, it's their problem not yours. FYI, seizure meds can make you misunderstand a lot of stuff because of how they affect your brain. Talk to HR at work about insurance. If they don't offer it, get your own now that you can afford it.",

    "postText": "I (20f) have been friends for a while with a guy (21m) for a couple years now. We've always hanged alot considering we worked together for a while and have similar religious beliefs so we pretty much good friends.\n\nSo about a year ago I decided to take time with myself and refrain from relationships and just focus on my school and my business precisely during the same he also got a girlfriend currently (30f). I was surprised at first but he seemed genuinely happy so I was happy for him. Ff about a month ago he said something about his mom wanting to meet as we'd just greet usually when we on a phone call and I didn't mind at all. After all he'd told me before that his girlfriend had already met his family, so I was cool with it. \n\nSo last week his mother (who is a pastor) was ministering at a church close to my place and apparently the whole family was there. He asked if we could chat after service I was okay with it we hanged for like 30 minutes.. when he's mom came he introduced us however they way he did it I now noticed that he left alot room for assumption but then I didn't mind on it. The same night the big sister texted me all excited of how she's happy that I'm with him. \nI was confused so I asked him about it and he said I shouldn't mind much and just go with it for now, he'd clearly it up the next day. I asked him why he couldn't do that then considering there in the same house, he said he would. Gut feeling didn't settle well with me so I texted the sister how long she thought we were together. To my surprise, close to a year apparently before service he told his mom that he'd finally introduce her to the his girlfriend. \n\nThat made me mad, when I asked him about this he didn't respond till two days later where he explained apparently the girlfriend hadn't met the family yet when he told his big brother about her when they first started dating, he said the age gap was too much and if he'd handle a 30 year old woman he might as well as move out. That scared him off and he didn't want to risk it (mind you his family is pretty old school and conservative so the reaction made sense) however the mom has talked to her on the phone a couple times so she knew he was dating. The crazy part was the mom didn't know both our faces hence it was easy for him to switch me in. \n\nThis made me furious!. He begged not tell his family cause he loves his girlfriend but we both know if his mom knows he's on the street. Asked him if he could stay with the girlfriend apparently the girlfriend is not comfortable with them moving in together. Now most of our friends and my sister are telling me to just go with it as there's no much harm to it as I don't have a boyfriend. But I'm refusing as I know this is not the right thing to do and it's all drama. So they all say I'm being selfish and an ASHL for not being there for my friend\nSo AITA?? \n\nFYI, the girlfriend doesn't know all this is going on.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m Asian, more specifically one of the only Chinese people in my grade, which has been absolutely fun these days. \n\nSo the girl in question, has been racially harassing me since the beginning of lockdown, when she dmed and said \u201cdid the bat taste good? thanks a lot you fucking freak\u201d. I reported her to my school, and they literally just dropped it because they said tensions were high, and she couldn\u2019t be blamed because her uncle had corona, some BS like that. Then I got repeated messages like that from fake/newly created accounts, that I suspect were from her, and I just kept blocking them until I guess she gave up because I wasn\u2019t reacting. \n\nMy school district has chosen to do in person, massively dumb imo, but whatever. On the literal second day of school, she walks up to me while I\u2019m in the lunch line and says in a thick asian accent, \u201cAre you eating bat dumpring or dog noodle?\u201d \n\nOther people around me fucking laughed, and I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to explain this, but I felt fucking humiliated. It finally felt like I got her off my back for a little while, and she comes back as soon as school starts, and I already know my school administration isn\u2019t going to go to bat for me. \n\nI don\u2019t know a lot about this girl, since obviously I try to avoid her, but I did know that she had shitty teeth, lived in a trailer, and was very poor. I\u2019m ashamed to have stooped to this, but I just wanted to show her how I felt for once, so I said, \u201cI\u2019d be less concerned with what I\u2019m eating if I were you, and more worried about your diet, since you\u2019re the one who needs to figure out how to brush her teeth in a trailer with no running water. Stop trying to get sent to a hospital when you can\u2019t afford healthcare.\u201d \n\nOther students nearby told me I went too far because \u201cit wasn\u2019t her fault she was poor\u201d LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT I WAS ASIAN?!?! She literally fucking cried, like I didn\u2019t cry everytime she called me a fucking chink. She\u2019s left me alone ever since though, which doesn\u2019t matter since I plan on transferring anyways.",

I have a very solid understanding of narcissism and entitledness.\n\n**ETA TO MAKE IT SUPER CLEAR, THE TEXT BELOW IS COPIED FROM THE LINKED COMMENT. Because it's the best explanation of narcissm I've read in my life, and not everyone ckicks links.**\n\nBut since it's you, [here's how it works: Don't Rock the boat](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/):\n\n&gt;**Don't rock the boat.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I've been thinking about this phrase a lot lately, about how unfair it is. Because *we* aren't the ones rocking the boat. It's the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At some point in her youth, Mum/MIL gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again, and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize. How can they fix the situation?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ballast!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And the next generation of boat-steadiers is born.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A born boat-steadier doesn't know what solid ground feels like. He's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him to swim either. He'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, *because it did* .  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that *you* aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now you and your DH get a boat of your own. With him not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So the flying monkeys are dispatched. Can't you and DH see how much better it is for everyone (else) if you just get back on the boat and keep it steady? It would make their lives so much easier.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You know what would be easier? If they all just chucked the bitch overboard.\n\nOh and by the way, most boat rockers are men.\n\nEdited spelling",

But I know of plenty women who are boat rockers, including my former MIL. \n\nSince we live in a patriarchal culture, naturally more men are boat rockers. Women are literally trained by culture to coddle the emotins of men. We do it because some men are dangerous, and it doesn't show on the outside.\n\nAgain, that doesn't mean women can't be boat rockers, I mean r/JustNoMIL is dedicated to them. Anybody who are allowed to rock the boat will become a boat rocker. \n\nI'm really sorry you were in that situation, I hope you left the boat and got therapy to learn some healthier boundaries. Hugs from a reformed boat steadier.\n\nEta. The thing about being ballast is it's very difficult to unlearn boat steadying. I've spent my entire adult life trying to find solid ground.",

I was so sensitive, shy and afraid of embarrassment so I never said or did anything. Until..... the first day of school sophomore year. One of the main girls walked by me and very quietly said \"slut\" under her breath (which was ironic bc I was a virgin) and I randomly stood up without even thinking, followed her into the bathroom and proceeded to tell her I was going to beat her ass if she ever fucked with me again. \n\nAnd none of them ever did after that.

The fighting back doesn't help too much if the bully is committed, but it is the least worst of the bad options. It is always better to fight back once (verbally or physically), big time, send a message, take whatever suspension comes with it, than to get in small skirmishes and rack up multiple strikes.\n\nIt is always evident if the people giving advice have been bullied or not. Severe enough bullying can never be amiably resolved by the students. It usually requires an authority figure to take real action in an **incredibly** nuanced way, which almost never happens. Bullies themselves are often dealing with real complexes coming from toxic homes or other insecurities. Their hyper awareness about their inferiority, often leads to them wanting to ensure that they aren't on the bottom of the social pyramid.\n\nUntil schools start spending time on teaching kids empathy, these cycles of hatred will go on.",

By the time someone is numb to racist bullying, society has fundamentally failed them. No group is constantly piling on \"hahah your parents are drug addicts\", they're calling CPS before that happens. The only comparable forms of bullying are misogyny, homophobia, stuff like that, that is both accepted by far too much of society as \"stuff people should just deal with\" and refer to someone's fundamental traits as a human being.\n\n**Edit to coastal_elite below me:**\n\n&gt; I think the person\u2019s point was that there are things that can be more individually hurtful than race when it comes to bullying.\n\nThe parent comment said \"It\u2019s not even the worst\" and then gave two other examples of bullying people; I have no idea how to interpret that besides \"see, I have just proven that there are worse things to bully someone over!\" Hence, I think I understood their point correctly and you did not.\n\n&gt; However, there\u2019s a certain laziness to generic bigotry that, when employed by idiot children, doesn\u2019t cut as deep as it could because you know it\u2019s just an emotionally undeveloped child parroting society\u2019s worst assumptions about gay people. \n\nWere you fully cognizant that you were gay when you were, say, 6? 7? Extremely young children absolutely cannot process a \"laziness to generic bigotry\", and the associated bullying absolutely cuts just as deep. Further, even the fact that you call it \"generic bigotry\" further drives home my point that this is the type of bullying that people get numb to **because it is omnipresent**. That makes it all the **more** insidious, not less. Overlooking it because it is common only serves to make it last longer. We must fight it no matter how tiring it is.",

Even if I have every right to burn the place to the ground on my way out, I am still going to act professionally to protect future opportunities.\n\nIn case anyone cares for the story - I was home on winter break working for Red Lobster, I had started there at 16 and been there almost 5 years.  Before I came back I told them I could not work New Years Eve because it is my brother's birthday and we have a family dinner, but I could work any other day.  (I had never worked 12/31 in all the time I had been with them because of this.) The original schedule had me off, but then it was changed on 12/23 to show me working on 12/31 and another coworker had off.  I went to the manager on duty and explained that me coming back was conditional on this day off and that I had been previously scheduled off that day and could not work it.  She told me that was my problem because the other worker's family (who were close friends of hers ...) were having a party and the other worker needed the day more than me.\n\nI was already sick to death of the place - a lot of my favorite coworkers had moved on, I was graduating that year and would be starting my career and not coming back to work there and I really hated this new manager who was playing favorites.  I decided that this was my hill to die on.  I said \"It's not my problem - you need to change the schedule - I am not available on 12/31 and will not be here.\" She started getting in my face and telling me that I had to work.  So then I said \"You are going to need to find someone else for my shift tomorrow night, Christmas Eve, too.\"  This got her red and screaming about how irresponsible I am and how I had better be there on both 12/24 and 12/31.  This was in a lobby full of guests by the way, and a few coworkers had come over to watch.  At this point, I unclip the stupid rosette (a piece of our uniform) from around my neck and say \"And, I don't know what you are going to do about my shift tonight, but I quit, effective NOW.\"  And then I dropped that rosette on the ground like so much mic and walked out.  I didn't have a bag, my keys were in my pocket, I was freeeeeeeeeee - I just walked out the door while the manager continued screaming.\n\nSome coworkers raced outside to find me before I got to my car - they were all entertained within an inch of their lives and loved that someone gave it back to Sue for a change!  Later that night, another manager - the one who had hired me 5 years before - called to see if they could get me to come back - they needed me on 12/24, but I could have off on 12/31.  I told the guy no - that I had no interest in ever being around that other manager ever again and I was a college student - this job was for fun money - any time lack of funds kept me in during the semester, I would just let thoughts of Sue's red screaming face be my entertainment!",

The program I am looking at has assured admissions (with certain GPA and MCAT requirments, of course) to their associated med school with a plethora of options. It really feels like a \"second chance\" to even know about this option. Medical schools are seemingly increasing options for nontraditional students and I am so thankful to get the chance to at least try my chance at doing what I've wanted to since I was little.\n \nGood luck in your studies!

Schools have to give a shit about their well-being (and if broke schools in Appalachia can afford to do it, no one else has an excuse not to). And they obviously have a fucking duty to protect students from racist bullying, Jesus Christ.\n\nGood luck with your next school, OP. You don\u2019t need any of that bullshit.",

A poor white person often refuses to acknowledge the struggles of a person of color while crying hoarse about how they've been struggling all their life (that's not to say their struggles are not important but acknowledgement of the other is absent). In general, they don't seem to show ally-ship and have shown little or no empathy. Some sets of stereotypes get more shit than others, that is a social-scientific fact (which is why intersectionality in social issues is important).\n\nYour school is the BIGGEST AH for dropping the complaint. Is there a higher authority you can go to?\n\nEdited to add: for anyone who still thinks OP was being racist, a big no. If you read what OP has said carefully, OP did not bring up any stereotypical statements. OP directly commented on the harasser's current condition, even explained it to us. OP didn't say, \"now I think harasser(H) might be poor since people who look like H are often poor\". Instead, OP said, \"this is what I know about my harasser and chose to be mean about it\". So OP responded unkindly (deserved) but was NOT being racist.",

There were still other ways, which might or might have not worked or been worth the effort (eg going to her parents; filming the bully and outing her, which only works if it goes fairly viral or gets views etc) \n\nI'm not going to shame OP for doing that but it's the sucky route to take and by the sound of it doesnt align with their values.

    "postText": "So here is the situation.\n\nMe: nurse. Working 50ish hours a week in paediatric ICU. Cry at least once a week because that shit is hard. My salary pays our bills. All of them. \n\nHusband: 25M. Has a degree but isn't looking for a job. Works 2 days a week at the grocery store. Spends most of his time playing LoL. \n\nBtw all events here are in accordance with Covid Legislation. \n\nToday was supposed to be A Good Day. I had been begging my husband to swap his Saturday shift to literally anything else so that we could have days off together. We haven't had a weekend together since our wedding, 18mo ago. \n\nToday was supposed to be our first Saturday off together. We were going to go to an animal sanctuary.\n\n\nHe starts the day by going to breakfast. With his best mate. Leaving before I even wake up. I wake up around 9 and realise he is not home. Call. He says he's helping his mate set up some lights and that the weather is too rainy for the animal sanctuary anyway. \n\nHe gets home at 1ish. Lies around. Plays some video games, promising we would cook dinner together tonight.\n\nLeaves again at 5 to help the same mate with something else. \n\nI go grocery shopping. I don't drive because of medical issues, but I walk there and back in the rain. I get home, realise I've left my keys inside. Call husband, knowing he's 5min away. He says he will leave in a minute. I sit in the rain and the cold (southern hemisphere). 45 min later, I call again. He hasn't left yet. He finally agrees to come and let me in the house, so he drives up, presses the clicker to let me in the garage and leaves again. \n\nAt 10, I I called to see where he is. His friend answers. Says he is driving out to do something an hour away. \n\nIt's 10.30. I am going to bed. I have sent him a txt that I am upset and don't want to speak to him tonight and would rather he left me alone. \n\nAs far as I am concerned, if he can't value me more than his best mate on the first day off he and I have shared in a year and a half, he can go sleep in his bed instead. (Btw, his friend doesn't work, so they hang out all the time when I am at work). \n\nHe is going to be upset. And he is gonna tell his mate and his mate is going to tell him I'm being a bitch. \n\nAITA\n\nAdding some info: I am 26. We weren't always like this. I don't know what changed. I'm fairly confident he's not having an affair. And I fully intend on talking this through, but at a time that isn't 4am. \n\nAlso the crying: sick babies sometimes make me sad, and I love all my patients. That's why I cry. And I don't mean hours of sobbing. I mean stepping into a supply closet to take a moment before getting back to work. \n\nAlso thank you for your kindness. I was expecting maybe 5 replies. I am trying to respond as much as I can. But there are a lot of you.",

He wanted to take his best friend on vacation with us, except they were going to travel separately by motorcycle- which would take a week- and I'd fly alone. He wanted to spend our anniversary with his best friend. (Post-divorce, he and the same best friend bought houses next door to each other, where they live with their beards/wives.)\n\nOP, you're NTA, and you deserve so much better than this. \n\nI've been through a lot of hard times since I left that husband, but every single day, even the hardest, has been illuminated by knowing that I chose to believe and act on the fact that I didn't deserve to be treated like dirt. If your husband can't stop treating you so poorly, I hope you can believe the same thing. I'm going to believe it for you, for now.\n\nEdit: wow, thank you all for the upvotes and the awards. I wish I could tell that sad, hopeless, long-ago me the story of what happened when she told this story today. I hope you all have wonderful days w great food.",

If he can't spend 1 day with you in 18 months and chooses to spend that day with his friends then kicking him out of the bedroom isn't going to change his behaviour. He needs to start making you, his wife a priority or he needs to pack his shit and leave. He doesn't work and isn't looking for work. He spends all day every day hanging with friends or gaming while you work your ass off helping others and paying bills. Couples therapy isnt going to change that as he probably believes you are over reacting and he has done nothing wrong. Sorry to sound harsh but you married a dud. He's lazy and inconsiderate. Personally I'd throw the whole man away and start again. NTA",

            "comment": "I'm going to guess that your medical issue is epilepsy, considering that you're healthy enough to continue nursing, and 50+ hours/week at that, because you're unable to drive.\n\nComing from a background of having a chronic disability, I can attest that it fucks with your self esteem. Honestly, ridiculously low self esteem is the only reason I can think of, that you would stay with him.\n\nSome points to consider:\n\n1. Despite working in a grocery store and being the driver in the family, your DH (dickhead husband) didn't bother getting your shopping in, even though you'd worked all those hours and he QUITE LITERALLY DIDN'T NEED TO MAKE EXTRA EFFORT BECAUSE THAT'S HIS FUCKING JOB!\n\n2. When he came back in, he suggested that you cook TOGETHER, rather than him cater to you. Considering the rough time you've been having, putting your life at risk to take care of poorly children, he should be kissing your fucking boots.\n\n3. Knowing that he hadn't done the shopping, he still left you to WALK to the shops in the pissing rain, for the food THAT YOU WERE EXPECTED TO MAKE. When he has a car. Let that sink in.\n\n4. He either couldn't give a fuck that you were locked out in the pissing rain, with a medical issue, enough to leave you sitting there for 45 minutes when he was only 5 minutes away, or he wasn't where he said he was. My gut reaction is that it was the latter and you should be asking yourself why he would lie about where he was.\n\n5. He knowingly and deliberately ruined your plans for the day, didn't bother making any new ones, and had the audacity to leave you with expectations of spending some sort of time together. So that you couldn't make plans, or enjoy your day off either.\n\n6. You had to BEG the man that supposedly loves you the most in the whole world, to spend ONE DAY with you, after 18 months.\n\n7. Despite making a vague plan to \"cook together\" later, he dumped you for the entire evening and night. So you had to make your own dinner and eat alone. He didn't let you know when he'd be back and didn't even have the courtesy to answer his phone.\n\n8. The fact that you expect him to BE ANGRY WITH YOU for daring to set consequences for his disgusting behaviour, and that somehow you should give a fuck what his 'friend' thinks of same, suggests that this isn't new behaviour. Honestly? It sounds like you've been gaslit and brainwashed into thinking that your valid af feelings and issues with him, are crazy.\n\nSweetie, if he's told you that nobody could love you/he's a saint for putting up with you/you deserve this treatment, because of your illness, this is emotional abuse. \n\nHave you honestly looked deeply at why you cry so much? I think you'll find that it's not solely because of your work and likely heartbreak at being made 2nd best, despite how much you're putting into your marriage.\n\nYou don't need him, you can't count on him, you're being mistreated and you deserve so, so much better. It does sound like he's cheating on you and he's most definitely using you.\n\nSo ask yourself, why do you stay? NTA 1000%",

I work two 12 hour days, two 12hr nights, Monday through Thursday. So I sleep during the day Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. And between all that, and trying to fit in the rest of life around that gets tricky.",

If you\u2019re the one paying all the bills, you have the upper hand here and should use it wisely. Stop subsidizing his lazy ass. Separate for as long as it takes you to either be sure he loves you or be sure he doesn\u2019t love you. It\u2019s already easy to see he loves your paycheck. Take that away from the equation and make him pay his own way. Do what\u2019s easiest for you to legally do at this point; either leave or make him leave. Either way, don\u2019t help him financially. If he\u2019s willing, invest in couples therapy if he\u2019ll join you, and individual therapy to help you navigate your growth throughout this time. \n\nAnd, best wishes to you. Thank you for being a pediatric nurse. That is one of the hardest jobs. You deserve a partner who will help you through the rough days.",

If he\u2019s barely working, why are you doing the grocery shopping?  \n\nWhy the \u201clol\u201d after you report that he\u2019s minimally employed?  \n\nThings that may seem cute or mildly annoying now can become huge and grind you down later.  Start paying real attention to who you married.  Take the blinders off because you don\u2019t want to be carrying him and mothering him the rest of your life.  \n\nMaybe this story makes him seem worse than he actually is but if not...consider your future and what you want it to look like.",

My little sister struggled with addiction for most of her life. I never wanted kids, but now I have one.\n\nOP, nobody will know what it's like. So many emotions - anger, fear, resentment, empathy, and anger again. And heck, my work promotes harm reduction and acceptance of drug use and encouraging healthy alternatives rather than penalizing users. I have naloxone on me all the time. I have all the compassion in the world, and I still feel such fury for the harm my sister caused my family.\n\nI hope your sister recovers. Mine died of an overdose about 4 weeks ago this very minute, just 6 weeks after getting out of a recovery jail she transitioned into after prison. She was only 30. She hadn't talked to her son in weeks on the phone and it had been weeks before that, and hadn't seen him since I took him back to visit her over a year ago. He went to school with a plan to make a mother's day card so I could send her a photo and after I picked him up I had to tell him mommy was dead. It breaks my heart to even type it. I feel such immense anguish and pain and sorrow for myself, but even more so for the little boy sleeping downstairs and my poor parents.\n\nBut I won't lie that I feel a deep sense of relief that not only is he safely ours now with no chance she might complicate and traumatize him later, but also because he is so safe and loved and has resources and therapy and a community of folks to protect him.\n\nDon't feel guilty for any of it. You are a good person and that baby will thank you for it when they're all grown up \u2661",

It's been 9.5 years and her birth mom has a 3.5 year old. I also thought taking her in would be temporary. I'm single and only on social security (1,000/month) and food stamps ($200). I don't qualify for any other benefits because I haven't adopted her. Her birth father has 17 other children. \n\nThere have been long periods where we didn't hear from her mom. Her mom's family accused me of keeping her away. She's had her own cellphone since she was 4, they still don't call. We only confirmed who her father is recently. He's still too busy being a rolling stone. \n\nAs for why you didn't take your sister in, I found drugs in my home. I had strange people calling and knocking on my door. I've never used any illegal substances and rarely drink alcohol. I didn't want this around the place that is supposed to bring me peace. \n\nEnjoy your newly expanded family and the security you've given YOUR daughter!",

And tell her that adoption doesn't mean she has to stop loving her birth mom, or that she has to call you mom, or that she needs to change her name, or anything else. It can just be a piece of paper that would potentially give you access to some more resources to give her the best life possible. And maybe remind her that a lot of people have two moms, and it doesn't have to be a competition.\n\nSorry, rambling a little. Maybe you've already had this talk with her. Just... I'm sure she's aware on some level of the money issues. Even if it's just awareness of the things other kids has that she doesn't. Explaining the direct connection between legal status and money might be the justification she needs to choose you and the life you have together.",

            "comment": "You posted this a year ago - contradicts your latest post.\n\n\u201cSo me (f23), my best friend (f22) Sara, and her little sister (F18) Tina.\n\nSara has 2 kayaks and moved out of town, but left the kayaks with her mom and told me that I could use them whenever I wanted to. One day Tina and I decide to go kayaking, we let her mom know, pack up the kayaks, and go. Important; Tina has several medical conditions, (none that made it unsafe for her to kayak) but she can have hallucinations and pass out. We get into a situation where we both almost died and lose the kayaks in the process (long story; character count won't let me tell the whole thing, but there was a lot of action. I swallowed plenty of water, she passed out several times, then 2 miles of me carrying her to where the ambulance could meets us).\n\nWe both end up being ok. But after all this Sara is mad that her kayaks are lost and demands that we each replace the kayak we were in. She says if it was an accident that they were lost or not, we are still responsible for the things we borrow. Which is fair. However, considering that we both almost died, it hit a sore spot that THAT'S what she was worried about. Also, she never used the kayaks and no one was taking care of them, to the point that the reason we got on the water 2 hours after we were planning to was because we had to wash the mold off of them. Also, that we're long time, very good friends where things like this would normally be brushed off and forgotten. She claims that we were irresponsible for kayaking so late in the day (2pm water time?) and that we didn't ask her if we could even use the kayaks (she said we didn't need to ask and we let her mom know). Also, I don't make much money and live paycheck to paycheck, whereas she makes 6-figures. The kayak was $700-800, she spends that much in a day on bags and clothes and that's a week and a half of pay for me.\n\nHer sister refused to replace hers, but just because we're friends and I didn't want to argue about it, I decided I would buy a new kayak. But as I don't make much money, it was very difficult for me to buy one, and since I disagree with having to replace it, I wasn't in any hurry. But this also meant that if I spent money on ANYTHING else, she would bring up the kayak. She brought it up so much and we argued about it so much that it got to the point where I said I would not be replacing the kayak because of the way she was acting about it and because I still don't agree with having to replace it at all. I told her \"I saved your sister life, almost died myself, and in the process, lost a kayak. And now you care more about the kayak than you do our friendship. If you really wanted a kayak, you would have bought one. I will not be replacing it and if you bring it up again, I will cut contact.\" Since then we have barely spoken and or friendship has all but disintegrated.\n\nSo Reddit, who's the asshole in this situation?\u201d",

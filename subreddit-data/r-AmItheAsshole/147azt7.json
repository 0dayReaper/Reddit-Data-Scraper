We met in college but became best friends after college when we realized we lived closer than we thought. We have always lived in 2 different states but took time each month to see each other. I finally got married at the beginning of 2022, moved across the country with my husband (military), and soon after found out we were having twins (our first kids). It was a lot of life changes to go through in a short period of time. I always tried to maintain contact with my best friend, but I'll admit sometimes I forgot to respond to her almost daily text messages. After I had my twins I really struggled with post partum depression and some days it was all I could do to just take care of myself and my babies. Still I tried. It wasn't great on the communication part on my end, but I tried. It all culminated with my best friend telling me that if she didn't initiate the conversation we would never talk. I reminded her that there was a 2 hour time difference so when she texts me at 5 am her time it's 3 am my time and I'm not awake. Plus when I do finally wake up I immediately have to take care of 2 crying babies. Sometimes it's hours before I can respond. After feeling super guilty when she told me I don't initiate conversations, I finally told her that I have to focus my attention on my family. I told her I value her friendship and never not want to be her friend but I need grace and patience in this season of my life. She told me she didn't expect me to text her all the time. She was easy to please and check ups every now and then would suffice. I felt good about that. And so once a week I'd send a text and update her about what's going on with me and my twins and ask her about things going on with her. And she would respond but never initiated anything anymore. Then 2 days ago she sent me a message saying she didn't want to be a seasonal friend or a friend of convenience. And that I didn't need to text her anymore. Haven't heard from her since. I want to be clear I know I wasn't perfect in this relationship. Maybe I could have tried harder. But seriously after having kids things in my life changed drastically. I don't want that to be an excuse but it did change.  \nThanks",

From the story, what he wanted was no tv in his living/sitting room. So if she wanted it, she\u2019d be responsible for making it happen. I\u2019d hope that as an adult, one is planning and working within sensible frames of mind. Why hang a photo askew or off center, let alone a tv? She can\u2019t be that desperate for a tv in the living/sitting room that as long as it\u2019s up, it\u2019s whatever. And how disrespectful to go to someone\u2019s home and not take proper care to hire knowledgeable staff to have the task completed properly. She hired two people, both incapable and then let them do a bad job. Just because it isn\u2019t her home doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok to have things happen any kind of way. I just reread and he says there was an outlet there and brackets already up. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask that the work be done correctly, by professionals, and centered. They just had to take one down and put one up. But because it was mounted wrong they had to run wires down and use an extension cord to reach a plug on a different wall. Being someone\u2019s partner doesn\u2019t mean you can claim incompetence because it\u2019s not your home then claim well if you wanted it done right you should\u2019ve done it yourself. That\u2019s rude and she could\u2019ve kept the tv in the guest room if that\u2019s how she was going to go about the situation. Weaponized incompetence is not ok.",

My partner likes watching tv and didn\u2019t want a television relegated to a guest bedroom, so\u2014happy wife, happy life\u2014I compromised and allowed her to arrange for a tv to be installed to replace the art so long as I didn\u2019t have to spend time thinking about it and she doesn\u2019t like to be micromanaged so I stayed hands off. \n\nThe first guy she hired didn\u2019t know how to install a tv. The second guy had the same problem but installed the tv anyway. Though there was an outlet on the wall, he installed it so that there are wires hanging down to attach to a power strip on the floor that attaches to an outlet five feet away. To make that work, he installed the television so that it was dramatically off-center above the fireplace by over a full foot. If I ever resell the house, I\u2019m going to have to get it completely redone so that it doesn\u2019t look like a sophomore dorm room. She said nothing as he was doing such an obviously bad job and I only found out after he left. \n\nNow she\u2019s mad that I\u2019m upset with her for being so irresponsible with my house and hiring and supervising the installation instead of thanking her for arranging to install a tv I didn\u2019t want installed in the first place. She hasn\u2019t been willing to arrange for it to be installed correctly; she thinks it\u2019s fine because she can watch tv now. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What sort of boomer nonsense is this?\n\n&gt; he installed the television so that it was dramatically off-center above the fireplace by over a full foot\n\nYou think your partner ought to be some kind of an expert on TV installation so that she can easily tell when something goes wrong and then immediately correct the repairman? Seriously?\n\nShit like this happens, botched repair and installation jobs are not uncommon at all. Why are you mad at your partner and not at the dumb dude who installed the TV?\n\nNot to mention, as a 53 year old home owner who has a \"tasteful piece of investment-quality art\" hanging above the fireplace (well, hanged above the fireplace... now there's an offset TV screen there), you probably ought to know  all about the perils of hiring lowly blue collar workers to do a house repair job. Why didn't you supervise the work?",

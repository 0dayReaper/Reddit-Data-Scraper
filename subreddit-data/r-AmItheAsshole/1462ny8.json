Maybe one day he will realise that being jealous of your success won't get him anywhere. Or maybe he won't. Either way, it's not your problem.

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo I, (24 F) am starting to build my career in opera performance. I just graduated with my bachelors from a great school, and got a full time teaching job to supplement my income while I do auditions. I plan to audition for grad school in the fall, and I\u2019m waiting to hear back from my local opera company to see if I got into the Chorus. However, the most exciting thing that I\u2019m doing right now is that I was offered a big role in an opera that I\u2019ll be going to Vienna, Austria to perform this summer! I\u2019ll leave in just a few weeks!\n\nNow, by no means was this trip cheap. Without giving away exact costs, it came pretty close to $5k. I\u2019m very lucky in that I have some family that was able to help me, and I\u2019m forever grateful to them. That being said, with my full-time teaching job I was able to pay well over half by myself. It was very hard and required a lot of ramen and hot pockets for dinner, but I\u2019m so proud of myself that I was able to manage it! However, I do acknowledge the fact that I did get a lot of help, and I am very grateful for that.\n\nNow onto my \u201cfriend\u201c, he (25 M), has been through some hard stuff due to his own poor decisions. This has been very damaging to him, however, he has done virtually nothing to try to help himself. His mindset is, he\u2019s had it hard therefore everyone has to help him. His mother pays for him to live rent free in his own place with the stipulation that she stays with him once every few months for a couple weeks. He hasn\u2019t had to work in two years and his mom has given him a $1200 gaming laptop. Up until very recently he would wake up at 3-4pm, play video games on his laptop until 5am, and then rinse and repeat. Every. Single. Day. Meanwhile, he has told me (exact words mind you) that he is smarter than everyone and is always right about everything. \n\nWe hang out for one day and immediately he starts taking jabs at me. We ended up getting into a fight because he says I\u2019m privileged. I don\u2019t disagree that I am very lucky to have family that helps me, but I also know I\u2019ve worked very hard to get what I have. My parents don\u2019t pay my rent and I had to take out loans to go to school while his mom offered to pay for his school. \n\nAfter his whole little rant, I said, \u201cYou really just hate to see me successful don\u2019t you?\u201d He said no, but I told him that because this only came up when I told him I was going to Europe, it seemed to me like this stemmed from jealousy, and that he wanted to convince me that I didn\u2019t earn what I have to make himself feel better. \n\nI thought I was fine, but my boyfriend thinks I might have been too harsh. So, am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

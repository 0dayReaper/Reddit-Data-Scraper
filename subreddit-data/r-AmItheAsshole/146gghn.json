    "postText": "My fianc\u00e9 and I live in a small 2b2b apartment, mid April his parents came from South America to stay with us, it is currently June and they are still here, I asked my fianc\u00e9 last month, \u201chey, so like when are your parents going to leave?\u201d He got all irritated and asked \u201cwhenever they want, if they stay here for an entire year that\u2019s fine by me, I would do the same for your parents.\u201d I responded with \u201cmax I would let my parents stay two weeks, I would go crazy\u201d and he was like \u201cwell, why don\u2019t you just stay at your parents for a month, while I live here with my parents?\u201d Haha, no. Now, big news his dad is getting some surgery here in the states so, how ever the fuck long that is going to take, he\u2019s only now just doing the xray portion of things next week. And they don\u2019t have cars, that\u2019s another thing, they can\u2019t go anywhere, unless me or my fianc\u00e9 takes them somewhere. Yes, ok they pay for groceries, but idk how much longer I can handle the stress. I dread going home most days, just because I know they are there. I\u2019m just so stressed out, and my fianc\u00e9 knows, but he said it\u2019s his parents, he doesn\u2019t know how much time he has left with them, and he wants to spend the most time with them as he can. I get it, but I just can\u2019t justify more than a month. AITA?",

For many people, it is normal that parents stay with their kids for extended periods, especially if their trip from their home country is long and expensive. And, in this case, it sounds like the trip was partially due to health reasons..... \n\nThis is the norm for many and an unspoken understanding. For many others, it is not. If this isn't what OP is OK with, it may be best to go on their separate ways. It sounds like they have two very different ideas about family/boundaries.",

I normally dislike when cultural differences are used in judgements on posts about partners. Sure, people have all sorts of cultural differences, but surely you'd still discuss things with your partner and get the go ahead? And if it is something that doesn't occur to you as something that's a cultural difference, then when it's pointed out like this, you then discuss it right? You don't just dismiss it like OP's partner did.\n\nWhatever the cultural differences, you're still supposed to care about your partner I would think?

So in his mind, obviously, he is entitled to do what he wants and you can just deal with it. \n\nNow that you know just how much he actually cares about you and and respects your wants and needs, and how much of a say he thinks you should have in your own home, what are you going to do? Are you going to tolerate the situation, or not? If not, you do understand that your only choice is to leave, right? He suggested you go stay with your parents for a month, but my advice is that instead, you start packing up all your stuff and when the end of the month comes around, withhold your share of the next month\u2019s rent, take your things and go stay with your parents until you can find your own place to live. \n\nWhen you bf tries to make it seem that you are overreacting, or you are wrong to leave, or you should be willing to put up with having his parents there indefinitely, just tell him you see no point in discussing things with him because he obviously does not care at all what you think or what you want. He\u2019s made it clear that if you don\u2019t like it, you should move out, and that is what you are doing. Now he can live with his parents as long as he likes, without having to deal with you being unhappy about it, so there should be no problem, right?",

If my dad was sick and needed surgery, he could come live with me for as long as he needed. Even if he didn\u2019t need surgery, he could come live with me whenever but I could do the same too. I get that culturally in the US, that\u2019s a \u201cOMG how is that possible\u201d but I can\u2019t wrap my head around how would I even tell me dad that he can\u2019t stay with me. He\u2019s my dad, He made me who I am. My parents are the reason I am here. And when my parents need me, coz they are old, they are either going to come here to live with me or I am going back to live with them so they can age with dignity, surrounded by family. Though and I think this is the problem, any partner I\u2019ve had, I\u2019ve discussed this with them once the relationship was becoming serious. And I think that your bf should have discussed this with you, however I only learned that I should discuss this after my first fight with my partner. \nI don\u2019t mean to dismiss your feelings which are valid. I am just trying to give context, which it seems your bf is not giving. Overall I would agree with others that if this is such a big deal to you, then you probably need to think about the viability of this relationship. Coz your bf is not going to change his mind. I wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s just not in me. I can\u2019t put someone else\u2019s needs over my sick dad\u2019s. It\u2019s engrained in me culturally. You take care of family and that means very different things culturally. \nI am sorry you are going through this OP.",

            "comment": "NAH.   You have a cultural problem, not an interpersonal one.   Families work differently in different cultures.   In the US, we expect children to grow up and found their own nuclear families, which maintain separate space.   We create rules that reinforce that separation (like, parents can't stay for more than two weeks).   Children really aren't supposed to have to support parents or care for them, that would make the parents a \"burden\" and they hate that idea.  That's fine, that's our way. \n\nBut their way is different.  People live in intergenerational households.  They are expected to help one another and pool their resources.  Demands for privacy are much lower, and parents feel perfectly entitled to be in a couple's business, because it's all one family.   If parents need to stay for a year, they stay for a year. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is being wishboned by these two radically different expectations.  He feels enormous pressure from his family to live up to their social norms.  But he feels huge pressure from you to live up to yours.  He literally cannot win.\n\nI think you two need to make your expectations and norms super, super clear.  Let him explain to you what his parents expect from him.   Listen without judging--it's not wrong, just different.   Then listen to what he really wants to do.   What would make HIM feel best?  \n\nAt the end of that, you have to decide if you can live with it.  If you can't, bail now.  You're not compatible.   But if you two can reach a set of guidelines you can both live with, you're back in business, and you can work together to communicate those to his parents with a united front.",

Now, big news his dad is getting some surgery here in the states so, how ever the fuck long that is going to take, he\u2019s only now just doing the xray portion of things next week. And they don\u2019t have cars, that\u2019s another thing, they can\u2019t go anywhere, unless me or my fianc\u00e9 takes them somewhere. Yes, ok they pay for groceries, but idk how much longer I can handle the stress. I dread going home most days, just because I know they are there. I\u2019m just so stressed out, and my fianc\u00e9 knows, but he said it\u2019s his parents, he doesn\u2019t know how much time he has left with them, and he wants to spend the most time with them as he can.

In fact, he told you that if you were so against his parents being *in your home* that you could leave *your home*. Basically, he said \u2018my decision is final, if you don\u2019t like it, leave\u2019. This isn\u2019t respect, OP. It\u2019s not even kindness. It\u2019s rude, inconsiderate, entitlement. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, I know this is typical reddit, but this is a giant red flag, and you should reconsider your relationship. Your fianc\u00e9 is telling you where you are going to stand in your relationship - always second to his family. He will invite them to stay for birthdays, Christmas\u2019, vacations, probably the wedding and definitely if you have kids. Can you imagine having this conversation with him, with a newborn? \u2018Mum is here to help, you should accept it, they\u2019re family, they just want to be here for us, she\u2019ll leave when she\u2019s ready, tough luck.\u2019 That\u2019s going to be horrific, OP, and I don\u2019t think you want that. \n\nGive him an ultimatum. Either he sits down with you to have a discussion and find a compromise (one that isn\u2019t \u2018they\u2019re family, they stay\u2019), or you go to your parents, indefinitely, and his parents can take over your portion of the rent.",

What does your lease say about guests? Most have time limits to avoid tenants not on the lease. His parents have lived with him long enough that it might be legally required to evict them. In many states, 30 days is enough for \"long term visitors\" to have tenant's rights, even though they aren't on the lease and don't pay rent. \nHe is likely to have violated the lease as well as your trust.",

At worst, this isn't culture it's just his family's dynamic, he's so deeply enmeshed with his family of origin that you'll never rank on his priority list and that a marriage with him will not be a joyful union but instead a miserable endurance that will only end with you waking up eventually, might as well let this incident be the one that opens your eyes, don't waste any more of your life.",

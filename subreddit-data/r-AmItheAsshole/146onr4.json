In the US that could affect you getting financial aid if it's found out.  \n\nYou need to separate your finances from hers immediately.  Get your own account that she doesn't have access to and have your school money put there.  Check your credit and if possible put a freeze on it.  Make sure she hasn't opened accounts in your name.",

She wanted it to be hush hush, I told my brother I gave my mum $250 as a gift because my brother and I are close and she got really mad. \n\nShe then said saying I\u2019m a student and need it more then she does . She sent it back to me. Saying she doesn\u2019t need my money. I said ok whatever. I put the money into my savings \n\nThis morning she called me saying she wants it back, that it\u2019s \u201cher money\u201d. I told her no, that you already ruined the whole thing and there\u2019s no gift in it anymore\n\nShe is calling me a greedy fool and she is calling me selfish. She said that money now is on me. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

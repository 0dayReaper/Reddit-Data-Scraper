    "postText": "I recently discovered I have an autoimmune disease. The disease has been debilitating for me and I find myself in severe pain every day. Because of this, I am constantly in and out of specialists and my medical bills are becoming significant, even with insurance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor context, my father and I have never really gotten along and he abused me frequently as a child. We have not had really any sort of relationship for a few years now because when he is in my life, it is always a shit show. When I was 18, he told me that he had created a custodial account for me so one day I could use that money on a downpayment or a wedding. After doing research on this type of account I discovered that I actually have more control over it than I thought I did. This account has tens of thousands of dollars in it and I realized it could really help me pay for my medical expenses, as I do not make a considerable amount of money at my current job (yes I am job hunting atm).  I contacted the bank to close the account and they informed me that a check for the full amount in the account would be sent to my father's house in my name, as I did not have a government ID when my dad opened the account (I was 3).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then proceeded to close the account and email my father letting him know I had been experiencing significant health issues and what my diagnosis was and closed the account in order to pay for the medical expenses. Instead of asking if I was okay, he completely lost it on me calling me a snake, selfish, a criminal, and a thief. I realized I wasn't going to get anywhere arguing with him so I very politely and professionally laid out what needed to be done and the legal ramifications if he did not mail my check to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo weeks go by and I have not received anything in the mail so I reach out to him over text. He proceeds to tell me he has cashed the check into his own bank account and that I am never to speak to him again. He proceeds to block me and then reach out to my extended family about the incident saying he just wanted to talk to me. I agree to meet with him to talk and he cancels and completely ghosts yet again. I am currently going back and forth with an attorney on the matter, as he forged my signature to cash my check, this was the only savings I had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor further context on the matter, my father paid child support to my mother for 5 years, opened this account to make up or it and then- didn't. The abuse I suffered at his hand triggered this autoimmune disease. Despite this, people have told me I should have reached out to him before closing the custodial account and that I should just forget about it all and move on and hope to get a new job. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole for suing my father?",

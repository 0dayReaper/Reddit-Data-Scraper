    "postText": "\nNot to be just another wedding post, but I am getting married in a few months and am planning the rehearsal dinner. I was pretty weak when it came to guest list and it ballooned from around 100 people to over 200 (including plus ones). \n\nA little back story, I recently took a huge pay cut and while my fianc\u00e9 does well, we still wanted to keep our budget. So we are having the wedding in my fianc\u00e9s hometown which will be cheaper than where we live now and it\u2019s about 2 hours away. That being said, I was going to be firm about the rehearsal dinner being for immediate family and participants in the wedding only.  \n\nWhen I told one of my bridesmaids the details she got VERY upset she couldn\u2019t bring her fianc\u00e9 and how I was being rude for not including him. When I explained that we wanted things to be more intimate so no one was getting a plus one to the dinner she reasoned that since they took off work to come early they should both be allowed to come. I never asked them to take off work since I\u2019m not even taking off the day before (new job, no time off). She also said that it was rude of me to just expect him to sit in the hotel for a few hours in a city he\u2019s not familiar with. \n\nShe is also getting married soon and always complains about how her fianc\u00e9s family is pressuring her to have an expensive wedding and always comparing their wedding to others\u2019. And I feel that is what she is doing to me here. \n\nI feel that she is my friend, not him. And while I know he\u2019s an extension of her, I\u2019ll get plenty of time to spend with both of them at the actual wedding. \n\nAITA for wanting to keep this one part of the wedding on the smaller side and not include plus-ones for the bridal party at the rehearsal dinner?",

But it\u2019s not really debatable that long term partners and spouses aren\u2019t \u2018plus ones\u2019 in the usual sense. If someone is invited to the rehearsal dinner, their fianc\u00e9 definitely should be too. And the reasons she brought up are why\u2014 this person has traveled to your wedding weekend and should be invited to all the events their partner is invited to.",

The wedding was nearly ten hours away from our home.  My spouse, the one child, and I were invited to the rehearsal dinner, but the other children weren\u2019t. We aren\u2019t the type to let complete strangers watch our children, they aren\u2019t old enough to stay alone at a hotel, and the only people coming to the wedding that my children would truly know wouldn\u2019t land until after the dinner. \n\nSo we passed on the rehearsal dinner. Child practiced, but we had dinner as a family. \n\nI understood that it was their wedding and a big expense for the couple but missing work, expensive hotels (major event taking place that weekend made hotels scarce and expensive but wedding venue cheaper), travel expenses, wedding party clothing demands, etc were nearly enough to make me throw in the towel just on principle. I sucked it up for the extended family members involved, but we wouldn\u2019t do it again, and it\u2019s given me a bad taste in my mouth regarding them, and they didn\u2019t seem impressed with us skipping the dinner either. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how close you are to this friend, but you should consider if the money is worth the impact it sounds like it may have on the friendship.\n\n(Not that it really matters, but, for our rehearsal dinner, all extended family traveling in attended - including the bride I mentioned above - which is very much the norm for every wedding I\u2019ve been involved in.)",

And her fianc\u00e9 is an adult, who can be in a hotel by himself for a few hours. We are pretty close, which is why I was surprised that she was so surprised I was taking this route. \n\nFor clarity we do have some (young) children in our wedding and of course their parents are invited to the dinner, since they will be attending and (at least) somewhat active at the rehearsal. And this is also a friend that routinely will always come around for the fun but never wants to be involved in the effort or finances for any given event\n\nWhat mostly stood out to me was that her reaction wasn\u2019t regarding no plus ones, but that -she- couldn\u2019t bring her fianc\u00e9. She was fine with it until it affected her.",

A rehearsal dinner is thrown as a generous thank you to your guests for putting so much time and effort into your special day, and instead you\u2019re trying to cut corners. I get that costs are a REAL issue, but you cut flower or dress expenses over expense that affect your guests.",

I was pretty weak when it came to guest list and it ballooned from around 100 people to over 200 (including plus ones). \n\nA little back story, I recently took a huge pay cut and while my fianc\u00e9 does well, we still wanted to keep our budget. So we are having the wedding in my fianc\u00e9s hometown which will be cheaper than where we live now and it\u2019s about 2 hours away. That being said, I was going to be firm about the rehearsal dinner being for immediate family and participants in the wedding only.  \n\nWhen I told one of my bridesmaids the details she got VERY upset she couldn\u2019t bring her fianc\u00e9 and how I was being rude for not including him. When I explained that we wanted things to be more intimate so no one was getting a plus one to the dinner she reasoned that since they took off work to come early they should both be allowed to come. I never asked them to take off work since I\u2019m not even taking off the day before (new job, no time off). She also said that it was rude of me to just expect him to sit in the hotel for a few hours in a city he\u2019s not familiar with. \n\nShe is also getting married soon and always complains about how her fianc\u00e9s family is pressuring her to have an expensive wedding and always comparing their wedding to others\u2019. And I feel that is what she is doing to me here. \n\nI feel that she is my friend, not him. And while I know he\u2019s an extension of her, I\u2019ll get plenty of time to spend with both of them at the actual wedding. \n\nAITA for wanting to keep this one part of the wedding on the smaller side and not include plus-ones for the bridal party at the rehearsal dinner?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I've been to 6 or 7 weddings as either part of the wedding party or the date of someone in the party. About half of those did not invite plus ones to the dinner, so I personally think that it's normal either way.\n\nHowever, I was curious about this, so I looked it up.\nA Google search of \"who gets invited to rehearsal dinner\" produced these top four hits in order (for me).\n\nThese two say that it's nice--but not a requirement--to invite and ones:\n\nhttps://www.brides.com/story/who-to-invite-rehearsal-dinner-etiquette\n\nhttps://www.marthastewart.com/7969802/rehearsal-dinner-guest-list-etiquette\n\nThis one says that traditionally, significant others are invited, but doesn't state that this is still universally the case:\n\nhttps://www.greenvelope.com/blog/who-goes-to-the-rehearsal-dinner\n\nThe fourth one on the list says that spouses or significant others should be invited.\n\nhttps://www.theknot.com/content/who-should-be-invited-to-rehearsal-dinner\n\nIt's hard for me to say you're the AH when there's not even a clearcut policy on this. It's not a classy move though. I get why your friend's upset because for many, the expectation is that they'll get a plus one to the rehearsal dinner.\n\nI'm not sure about the people emphasizing that it's her fiance as if that makes a difference. If you're going to invite plus ones to the rehearsal dinner, it should be irrespective of relationship status. Partner, fiance, spouse, whatever. The point of a plus one is to accompany the guest so they at least know someone, so it doesn't matter who they are to the invitee.",

In that case, it should be what you want and can afford.  \n\nTraditionally, I've seen it mostly be the wedding party and immediate family, usually right after the rehearsal and everyone goes to the dinner.

But after our talk, we were fine and she stood up to their families a bit, she conceded on some things but was happy in the end.",

And rehearsal dinner is for the wedding party, those who are actively part of planning it and making it a success. Not everyone even do have a rehearsal dinner, and some who does don't have a fancy dinner but cheaper buffee type of thing whilst still going through the schedule and thanking everyone for participating. Whether you invite plus ones or not is up to you. This is about your wedding. You and your partner make the rules.",

You will be making the rounds. Greeting guests and thanking them for coming. Stand here, smile. Take photos. Etc. If you want to include +1\u2019s as a more relaxed evening, feel free! If you really just want space and a breather with your wedding party, do that. :)",

It was quite embarrassing for those who brought the plus one (and their kids) because the hosts (parents of the groom) of the dinner asked who would be paying for their meals.  They hosts refused to pay.  It's not their wedding, not their budget, and not their choice.  If she can't live without him for a couple of hours, she has bigger problems.",

It is your choice on whether you allow additional guests at the dinner (or the wedding guest list in general) and your bridesmaid is not entitled to a plus one automatically. She should not have assumed (though her frustration is understandable since they sound like they are traveling from out of town.)",

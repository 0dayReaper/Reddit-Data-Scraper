    "postText": "**UPDATED 7:50 PM:** Holy crap! Thank you for the outpour of support, everyone. I never thought posting this in an online community was going to reach the right eyes so quickly! I had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when I checked back in after work. Several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on Reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. Apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy intent was to answer more questions since I wasn't able to do that while at work. I was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however I've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what I have already posted if I wish to pursue a civil suit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust a couple things I want to address in my update here. Some people are saying I'm leaving out details. My original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. I had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so I apologize if it looks like details have been left out. I did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. Lastly, my son is now back with me. There was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry if I didn't respond to your comment or private message. I'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. Truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. I can't even begin to put into words how grateful I am. Again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in November 2018 I was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced. I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. His mother is a heroine addict and I haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. They wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince my release, I've learned that I can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that I was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. I've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. They took down my info but never followed up. So what I did was create a website sharing my story. I also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. Literally the only reason why I was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. If the detective had done his job, he could have verified that I wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. This is what pisses me off the most. My life was ruined because of a lazy employee.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. I live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. My web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. I received a cease and desist letter recently, which I showed to my attorney. He said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything I had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. Yesterday I received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. He apologized, stating \"mistakes can happen.\" They then talked to me about my website and asked if I could remove it. I said I would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. Suffice to say that isn't happening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the visit I received, I'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. I don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. My friends think I'm being spiteful and have suggested that I just delete it. AITA for keeping my website up?\n\nEdit: Grammar",

While most of us do our due diligence to keep the children in our custody safe and we do everything we can to avoid removal, the fact is, we are not great parents and, barring shocking and heinous abuse/neglect, the best place for a child is always with their family of origin.\n\nThat $2,000,000 is a fantastic starting place just for the trauma of having his child removed and placed in foster care. If I were OP, I\u2019d also be questioning why his girlfriend was not considered for kinship placement. We do not consider only a child\u2019s blood relatives for placement purposes. We look at teachers, friends\u2019 parents, *the significant others of biological parents (both past and current)*, church members, godparents, etc.",

Speaking for my jurisdiction, you have to prove that the police weren't just negligent, but grossly negligent, which is a very high standard. As long as the detective is able to provide *some* justification for why he laid the charge (and apparently there was an eyewitness that pointed the finger at OP), the police department/municipality is in the clear.\n\nThat said, the cease and the desist letter is also toothless as long as the statements on the website are truthful. If the town where OP lives is so concerned about this website's impact that they pressured the detective to apologize in person, they're absolutely ripe for a cash settlement.\n\n*That* said, OP should ignore the people telling him to ask for $250k. Maybe he'll get it, but I doubt it. There's no liability to exploit, this is just a PR nuisance that the town wants to go away. What he should do is make a list of all the money he's lost because of this: the savings that went to the lawyer, the lost income because of the time in jail/time spent looking for a new job, money spent getting a new place since he'd been evicted from the old one. Make the list as detailed as possible, and as realistic as possible. No \"pain and suffering\" bullshit.\n\nThen he should go meet with the mayor and hand him the list with a summed figure at the bottom, which I imagine will come out somewhere in the region of $30k, and promise to take down the website/sign an NDA in exchange for that figure.",

Under American law, police officers (individually) have qualified immunity, and unfortunately there's virtually no chance that OP would get around qualified immunity in this case. (This is also how officers who wrongfully shoot people or commit other egregious violations tend to avoid civil liability, FYI). \n\nAnd if he tried to sue the city (suing the police department would be treated as suing the city), he'd have to demonstrate that there was a pattern or practice of similar misconduct, rather than a one time infraction. It sucks, but it's insanely difficult to sue and win in these circumstances. Blame the Supreme Court (literally - they have made it extremely difficult to sue law enforcement, even in egregious cases).",

Unless you\u2019re exaggerating the events or making up shit that didn\u2019t happen, telling your side of the story is not being an asshole. You\u2019re sharing the truth.\n\nIs it your fault that your website comes up when anyone searches up the city? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nIs it your fault that any of this happened? It doesn\u2019t sound like it.\n\nHas the city or police department done anything to help repair your life? Doesn\u2019t sound like it.\n\nIs the website illegal? Doesn\u2019t sound like it, according to your lawyer.\n\nI fail to see any way you\u2019d be an asshole for just sharing the truth about what happened to you. Going beyond that, it sounds like your \u201cdemand\u201d isn\u2019t even selfish. Wanting the detective to leave the force seems less like revenge and more wanting to ensure he doesn\u2019t ruin someone else\u2019s life. There likely is some feelings of anger and hostility towards him from you, but it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re making the decision based purely on that nor is the decision itself malicious or harmful to him or anyone else, let alone undeserving to him considering the shit job he did in protecting and serving you as a citizen.\n\nEdit: to add onto this...don\u2019t take the website down until they make better arrangements for you.\n\nThe detective leaving the force by itself is nice, but you have *a lot* more justice that is due to you.\n\nFor starters, your son being back in your custody and *at the very least* $13,000 for your legal fees needs to be reimbursed to you. I think you deserve more considering that it caused you to be fired and ruined your reputation with lots of people you know. The truth came out that you didn\u2019t commit the crime, but the fact of the matter remains that people still saw you being escorted out of the building in handcuffs. Not everyone of those people who saw you or heard the rumors knows the final outcome nor does it always satisfy the story in their heads that you really are innocent.\n\nMajor damage has been done and you are owed more than just requesting that one bad apple be removed.",

You spent 54 days ...almost 2 full months in jail- for a crime you were accused of and found to later be not guilty of.  This is a very common occurrence. Yes, we are innocent until proven guilty but bail destroys innocent poor people and can ruin your life as you have found out.  I\u2019ve seen the argument about well, if you don\u2019t want to be arrested, you shouldn\u2019t commit crime. But you didn\u2019t, you got arrested and you lost everything, including your son, because you could not post bond. \n\nWhat the high ups want is for you to tuck tail and go away quietly so they can rug sweep and go on as normal. \u201cMistakes do happen\u201d is a bullshit excuse. Yes. They do happen but when the police \u201cmistake\u201d ruins you...costs you your job, your freedom, your home, your son and your reputation, that is not something you walk away from. \n\nThe town wants you to go away? They need to make it right...fix you financially, get you your son, a home, a comparable job, and apologize PUBLICLY! You could have ended up dead or in jail for a lot longer time period as many people do while waiting for trial. \n\nGood luck to you! \n\nNTA",

Police departments have broad discretion to arrest people if they have probable cause to do so. What happened to OP is a straight up travesty of justice but there's not really much he can do. Law enforcement is granted broad immunity from suit unless there's some reason to believe they abused their power or arrested him under false pretenses.

Until the attorney was able to obtain the video, it was just the word of the witness against OP. That's enough to hold him for the crime. In most states, to hold them in jail you just need to show the judge you have probable cause to charge them with a crime. As a legal standard, probable cause is something to the effect of \"a reasonable person could look at these facts and think this person committed a crime.\"\n\nUnfortunately the wheels of justice turn slowly. Courts are always overburdened so you're always going to have to wait for a court date. The attorney is going to need to obtain video (the gas station has no obligation to comply unless there's a court order), prepare his filings, find and interview any potential witnesses, etc. 54 days isn't that long between arrest and exoneration.",

If you're worried about stuff like that, get a dashcam in your car and GPS on your phone. Keep an 'alibi' on you at all times so they can't place you where you weren't. Document everything with the police- if they show up at your door (CHECK LEGALITY FIRST, but single party consent is what's the law where I live) record them with your phone in your pocket.",

If you think this type of story is uncommon, I've got news for you -- its more or less the norm in the US legal system.  Arrest and charge first, ask questions later (if ever).  Do you know how many people sit in Rikers Island for months/years on trumped up drug charges for no reason?  We don't know what the crime was, but just eyewitness testimony is usually enough to get a warrant and indictment.  Cops/ADA's aren't going CSI and Law &amp; Order on every case.  Also, OP says he refused to speak with the detective, which is generally smart, but probably prolonged his stay in jail.  Although its unlikely the detective would believe him and just let him go, they certainly wont if you present 0 evidence to them.\n\n\nAs to suing the city/PD, OP can, but he will lose.  Its very hard to prove false arrest or malicious prosecution, and even harder when the cops were acting on eyewitness accounts.  You basically need to show the cops knew it was false or it was some plot against OP.  Failing to double check or verify is not \"bad faith.\"  Plus, even if the cop was out to get OP, OP still needs to impute liability to the city/state, and that itself isn't easy (otherwise you are just going to have a judgment against a person who cant pay it).\n\n\nAll of this sucks and is why we need CJ reform, but until it happens, its basically something that will keep happening and you'll have no redress.",

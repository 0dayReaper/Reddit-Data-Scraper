    "postText": "I (25M) am getting married this October and I was planning on sending out invites to my whole office except for one of my coworkers- I\u2019ll just call her Barbara. \n\nMy office is very small and tight knit and the majority of my coworkers are relatively young since the firm is much newer, except for Barbara who is an older woman. Barbara is the absolute sweetest woman and I know it must be hard to be the only person over 35 in the office, but she still gets along great with all of us. The only problem is that I\u2019m gay and I know that she\u2019s very religious/old fashioned and has made some anti-gay comments in the past. \n\nI\u2019m very stereotypically \u201cstraight\u201d looking and I usually hang around the guys of the office so she would have no reason to assume that I\u2019m gay, that and I try to keep my relationship details private. The only people who know I\u2019m even getting married at all are my three closest friends in the office, everyone else will find out I\u2019m gay and getting married when I send out invitations.\n\nI know she\u2019s bound to find out about the wedding and I know my coworkers wouldn\u2019t out me so I don\u2019t know how to go about this without making her feel excluded. I\u2019m torn because I don\u2019t want her image of me to change but I also don\u2019t want her to feel hurt by this. My friend suggested I very casually bring up the topic of gay marriage/attending a gay wedding in a conversation with her and see what her thoughts are and make my decision on that. \n\nWIBTA if I didn\u2019t invite her?",

She will find out sooner or later anyway, and I think sooner is better. If she is not okay with gay marriage, then so be it. Sure, that might ruin her image of you but that is probably better than leaving her excluded. Excluding her would also ruin her image of you, so isn't it just better to let her know about the wedding? You really shouldn't care about her image of you if she dislikes people solely of off something they can't control, like sexuality.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (25M) am getting married this October and I was planning on sending out invites to my whole office except for one of my coworkers- I\u2019ll just call her Barbara. \n\nMy office is very small and tight knit and the majority of my coworkers are relatively young since the firm is much newer, except for Barbara who is an older woman. Barbara is the absolute sweetest woman and I know it must be hard to be the only person over 35 in the office, but she still gets along great with all of us. The only problem is that I\u2019m gay and I know that she\u2019s very religious/old fashioned and has made some anti-gay comments in the past. \n\nI\u2019m very stereotypically \u201cstraight\u201d looking and I usually hang around the guys of the office so she would have no reason to assume that I\u2019m gay, that and I try to keep my relationship details private. The only people who know I\u2019m even getting married at all are my three closest friends in the office, everyone else will find out I\u2019m gay and getting married when I send out invitations.\n\nI know she\u2019s bound to find out about the wedding and I know my coworkers wouldn\u2019t out me so I don\u2019t know how to go about this without making her feel excluded. I\u2019m torn because I don\u2019t want her image of me to change but I also don\u2019t want her to feel hurt by this. My friend suggested I very casually bring up the topic of gay marriage/attending a gay wedding in a conversation with her and see what her thoughts are and make my decision on that. \n\nWIBTA if I didn\u2019t invite her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "postText": "For some backstory, my husband joined the service, he bought an expensive car with no financial advice. A 33k sports car. When I met him a few years later, he was broke as dirt, eating ramen all because of taking on a high car payment at only 25ish years old. Well, the fateful day came that the motor blew. The car had only 60k miles left on it and 20k left on the loan. What we discovered after the car was tuned (the warranty was up at the time of tuning by this point) was that the manufacturer issued a recall on the piston heads. We didn't qualify because my husband tampered with the car. This was back in 2021.\n\nFast forward to 2022, we finally get the car to a trustworthy mechanic. We expected this build to be 15k. I saw ads for cars just like his going for 43-47k stock from the wild used car market. So to me, I don't mind cutting my losses at a few grand and sell it. I mean that sucks but I can handle that. \n\nKeep in mind our relationship is amazing on every other level - we're happily married, and he treats me like a queen. He's an amazing man who fought with everything he had to come home to me while he was deployed. He's been left with a laundry list of disabilities. I wanted to be able to provide for him after he separated so that he could have a break. He deserves one. \n\nSo, the bills began snowballing. By the time the car was done, it has cost us over 28k. On the repairs. Nothing else. Not the loan interest, not the car itself. I'm astounded. I also learned today that my husband's mods are partly responsible for this. \n\nNow of course he doesn't want to sell, and I get it. It's his dream car. He loves it and I understand - it's his baby. And it's a beautiful beast of a car that's gonna be putting down like 500 something horsepower in a lightweight missile. \n\nSo now let's flip this to my side. I've worked so much overtime, come in the middle of the night to work, and just worked my tail off. Every dime I made last year went to his car and to that savings account that began draining slowly while he stayed home. I even ended up in a psych ward from lack of sleep too much stress. I've given up getting my dream car, and we live in a trashy duplex that hasn't been remodeled since the 60s. Black mold, 15 year old carpet that's disgusting. I'm driving a ticking time bomb, an Altima with 200k miles, of which it is a miracle that the cvt hasn't exploded. It has no AC and you can't shift out of park without a screwdriver. \n\nThe only thing we ever argue about is money. I can't afford to keep up with his car and change our financial situation, and honestly in the end I'm so tired of worrying. I hate that car now. If we talk about it, it always ends up in a pissing match that goes nowhere. \n\nSo now that you've heard it all... AITA for wanting to sell? \ud83d\ude1e",

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nFor some backstory, my husband joined the service, he bought an expensive car with no financial advice. A 33k sports car. When I met him a few years later, he was broke as dirt, eating ramen all because of taking on a high car payment at only 25ish years old. Well, the fateful day came that the motor blew. The car had only 60k miles left on it and 20k left on the loan. What we discovered after the car was tuned (the warranty was up at the time of tuning by this point) was that the manufacturer issued a recall on the piston heads. We didn't qualify because my husband tampered with the car. This was back in 2021.\n\nFast forward to 2022, we finally get the car to a trustworthy mechanic. We expected this build to be 15k. I saw ads for cars just like his going for 43-47k stock from the wild used car market. So to me, I don't mind cutting my losses at a few grand and sell it. I mean that sucks but I can handle that. \n\nKeep in mind our relationship is amazing on every other level - we're happily married, and he treats me like a queen. He's an amazing man who fought with everything he had to come home to me while he was deployed. He's been left with a laundry list of disabilities. I wanted to be able to provide for him after he separated so that he could have a break. He deserves one. \n\nSo, the bills began snowballing. By the time the car was done, it has cost us over 28k. On the repairs. Nothing else. Not the loan interest, not the car itself. I'm astounded. I also learned today that my husband's mods are partly responsible for this. \n\nNow of course he doesn't want to sell, and I get it. It's his dream car. He loves it and I understand - it's his baby. And it's a beautiful beast of a car that's gonna be putting down like 500 something horsepower in a lightweight missile. \n\nSo now let's flip this to my side. I've worked so much overtime, come in the middle of the night to work, and just worked my tail off. Every dime I made last year went to his car and to that savings account that began draining slowly while he stayed home. I even ended up in a psych ward from lack of sleep too much stress. I've given up getting my dream car, and we live in a trashy duplex that hasn't been remodeled since the 60s. Black mold, 15 year old carpet that's disgusting. I'm driving a ticking time bomb, an Altima with 200k miles, of which it is a miracle that the cvt hasn't exploded. It has no AC and you can't shift out of park without a screwdriver. \n\nThe only thing we ever argue about is money. I can't afford to keep up with his car and change our financial situation, and honestly in the end I'm so tired of worrying. I hate that car now. If we talk about it, it always ends up in a pissing match that goes nowhere. \n\nSo now that you've heard it all... AITA for wanting to sell? \ud83d\ude1e\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

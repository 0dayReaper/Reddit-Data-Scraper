You can meet elsewhere, your parents can try additional training, they can even keep the dog put up when you visit. Making them get rid of the dog when you're only occasionally around is the nuclear option and not reasonable. Also, dogs can sense fear. You being nervous is likely affecting your interactions.",

That said, you don\u2019t LIVE there and your parents have the right to get whatever dog they want. The dog has only been with your parents for a short time, so he\u2019s probably still settling in to a degree.\n\nWould it help to just ignore him? I have a shy GSD, and people being strictly scenery has been what has helped the most. He\u2019s most sensitive to social pressure like being approached, someone looming over him, or being stared at. So he does not make friends. It\u2019s a no, no matter what. And he is so much more comfortable in social situations knowing that I won\u2019t ask him to meet anyone and won\u2019t let anyone try to engage with him. I don\u2019t know you, your parents, or the dog so I\u2019d run that past the trainer, but maybe if the dog learns and can trust that you aren\u2019t going to apply that kind of pressure, it will be easier for him to handle your presence.",

I still visit home about 3 times a year, and they really enjoy seeing me since they're now empty nesters. \n\nGrowing up, we always had a family dog. I've never really liked or disliked dogs though. A few months ago, the dog we had for 11 years died and my parents decided to go to the local shelter to get a new one. They were really excited to tell me about it over the phone and were anticipating me getting to meet it during spring break.\n\nWell spring break came and this dog does not like me. I tried meeting it behind the dog gate at first, and it barked and snarled for what felt like 10 minutes straight. We decided to close the door and try again in a few hours after it heard my voice for a while to no avail. It basically stayed in the sunroom for all 3 days I was there. \n\nFast forward to today, and we tried again. I am visiting for a few days as it is the start of summer break. My parents found this dog expert who helped us try to retread the introduction and start over between me and the dog. Overall it seemed like it went really well. The dog would let me pet it and didn't seem on edge at all in the house while the trainer was there. We decided to go for a walk and all was good as well. After a family outing to the grocery store, things turned aggressive again. We entered the house and he started barking, which apparently was typically when he hears people come home. I started walking to the kitchen to meet him behind the dog gate so he could calm down and recognize me, but my mom let him out immediately before I entered the room. He ran right to the room I was walking through and started aggressively barking at me from about 5 feet away. This was not a friendly, curious kind of barking either. He was very clearly preparing to defend his territory. I slammed the door to the room and ran out of the house in fear. The dog is currently in the backyard now and is barking at me through the windows. \n\nI don't want to be terrorized in my childhood home.\n\nI'm thinking of telling my parents that as long as the dog is around, I won't be coming over. \n\nI honestly feel bad for this dog. Apparently it has a checkered past of abuse/neglect. It is not aggressive to other visitors, just me. My parents think maybe I remind him of his past owner or something along those lines. It's sad to think about a dog getting ripped from its new family after an already pretty awful life, but I don't feel like I should have to put up with being scared for my physical safety when I come back to the home I grew up in. It is a large German shepherd and could certainly do some damage if it decided to. Having said that, it hasn't actually tried to bite me yet.\n\nWill I be the asshole if I tell my parents they can choose between me and the dog?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think there's probably *many* solutions in between saying nothing and asking them to choose between you and the dog, but if you are uncomfortable staying there and are afraid then that matters. I'd try other solutions first such as seeing if there is a way to be in the house but always separated from the dog by gates? They could also muzzle train the dog so that if the aggression becomes a bite attempt the dog will not be successful. Muzzles aren't bad, I've muzzle trained my very friendly dog so she can't sneak garbage on our walks.",

That way they will (hopefully) start associating you with yummy things and become less aggressive over time.",

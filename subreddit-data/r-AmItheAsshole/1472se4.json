She showed up and it sounds like she maybe thought she could handle it. Now that it's a known trigger, reach out and tell her you were overjoyed to have her there, but realize for her it may have been too hard. Tell her you all want to see her more and present in each other's lives and are willing to let it be at her pace. Maybe you all can just catch dinner soon and she picks the date and place she feels most comfortable. I think healing can happen for you all and hope your family gets to be in a good place with one another! Best of luck!",

Do she still have resentment (especially towards you and your mother)?",

He tried calling her less after that and then after a point she stopped picking up, they had contact for some time. My mother called her on her birthday every year but she never picked up so she just sent her a text. My parents and her started talking after she got an apartment in our town. \n\nLast year my mum called on her birthday and she picked up for the first time they talked and she said she couldn't live in the past forever. We thought she had finally started feeling better about us, we don't know for sure though. She picks our calls on holidays now.",

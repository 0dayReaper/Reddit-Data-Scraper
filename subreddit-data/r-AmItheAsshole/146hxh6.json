I really want to be a cool uncle so I was trying my best to find the perfect present for her. I decided that the perfect gift would be a cat! I decided to adopt a cat from the local shelter and bring it to the birthday party. During presents I brought out the cat and gave it to my niece. She started jumping with joy and gave me a big hug, here\u2019s where the problem comes in. Her Father my brother was upset I didn\u2019t run it by him first. I figured that I wouldn\u2019t need to as they had been talking about getting a cat. Unfortunately my brother hasn\u2019t been talking to me and forced me to take back the cat.

Pets are expensive. \n\nI\u2019d don\u2019t blame your brother for pissed with you for putting these costs on them both, without receiving both of their consent first. You need to be taken to task over it, and I hope your brother has it out with you for your \u2018questionable\u2019 decision making here. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s the \u2018you picked a family pet out for them, without being a part of their nuclear family.\u2019 They may have wanted a different breed of cat, or type, or sex, or age. How do you know the cat will acclimatize to them all? You\u2019ve also forced your brother and his wife into a position where they cant return the cat, for upsetting your niece. This is a really unfair and selfish thing you\u2019ve done here, trying to be the cool uncle. \n\nAlso\u2026. Shelters do not adopt animals out to people who aren\u2019t going to be the owners of the pets\u2026. And they definitely do not adopt out to people who say the pet is to be a gift for another household. So you also lied to the shelter workers too, in order to get the cat. If they find out that you gave the cat away, they are within their rights to demand the cat be returned\u2026 and blacklist you, and all adults connected to the cat, from adopting another. Shelters and rescues talk to each other. Get blacklisted at one, and you can bet they all will know about it. Lying about the ownership of the cat makes you an AH for that alone.\n\nYTA.

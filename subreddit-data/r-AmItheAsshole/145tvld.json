    "postText": "Before I start explaining, I will give names to each character so you can understand who I'm speaking about.  \nBriana \\~ Ex best friend, Jacob \\~ Briana's boyfriend, Avery, my older sibling.  \nI, 16F, have ASD. Autism spectrum disorder. The type that makes me sensitive and I can easily cry. I was doing my school work one day when I got a message from Jacob. Jacob was basically telling me to stop being soft. I cried at this. Avery came into the room I was in and asked why I was crying. I explained to them how Jacob was telling me to toughen up and stop being soft. Avery said to me \"Do I have to talk to them again?\" Avery has helped with friendship problems in the past and they've gone great because of them. They're my go to person when having problems. Avery did eventually start talking to them. And Briana said in chat: Autism doesn't make you sensitive. I was so angry at this. I was ready to say \"what the hell do you know? your brother isn't sensitive due to his autism, so shut up! you have no idea.\" But I held back. At the end I said: \"I\u2019m done with you two, this is why I wanted to end our friendship. Cuz you don\u2019t see how Jacob affects my mental health. It is affecting how I focus and how I do my work. I\u2019m not letting you both affect my health no more. If you want drama, drag it somewhere else.\" I left the group and started crying so much. It hurt me so hard that my best friend was so mean. And was telling me I basically had no reason to feel this way. So, am I the asshole?",

I feel like getting my dad and sibling might've made it worse. \n2. I felt I should've not called for backup and just dealt with it myself, but to be fair, I couldn't.

I find that with both allistic and autistic people, resentment of sensitivity is actually resentment toward their own vulnerabilities.

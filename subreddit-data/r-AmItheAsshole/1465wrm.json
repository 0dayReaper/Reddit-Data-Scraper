As part of our arrangement, whenever I go to one of the properties to check on things, he pays my mileage.  It\u2019s generally 100-200 miles per trip. When I submitted my most recent invoice last week, he declined to pay my mileage for several trips I\u2019d already taken and cleared with him in advance, because \u201cbookings are down.\u201d I\u2019m pissed off, and out $400 in gas, tolls, and wear and tear to my personal vehicle. $400 I was counting on. I would have quit on the spot but I\u2019m counting on the income from my monthly property management fees. \n\nThe AITA question: Currently, my cousin has a guest in one of the houses he manages on his own that\u2019s scamming him. It\u2019s a by-the-book Airbnb scam. The way my cousin is handling it is wrong, and he\u2019s setting himself up for Airbnb to issue the guests a full refund. I know how he should be dealing with it, but I decided not to tell him because the amount he\u2019s going to lose on the booking is roughly equivalent to the amount he screwed me out of. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

An example might be that they say the sheets are dirty and put hairs on the sheets or some dirt on the sheets and then take a photo of the \u201cdirty\u201d sheets, claiming the place was unclean when they got there. And they will say things are broken that can\u2019t be visibly proven as broken, or anything else along those lines that the host will be unable to demonstrate to Airbnb is not the case. And they will escalate these complaints, eventually, making it seem like your immaculate, well appointed, fully functional home is a trash heap. If they are lucky, they will find an actual problem and just go hard on it. Eventually they ask Airbnb for a full refund. Airbnb so strongly favors the guests that they will often issue a full refund, and the host will be out of luck, having just had guests get a free stay at your place.",

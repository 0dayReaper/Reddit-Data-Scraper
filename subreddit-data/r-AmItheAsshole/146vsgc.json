Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy college friend and I were planning for me to come visit her this summer, the problem is she lives far away so it's a bit of a struggle getting there. \n\nI started looking up train tickets and managed to find one for a cheap price on the way there that would only take 4,5 hrs and no overlays, but the return train would be a 9 hrs night train (and I'd have to switch halfway through), and that felt like a lot of excessive hours, but still manageable. However my friend wouldn't cancel her gym class on the evening I'd go back home, so on top of the 9 hrs the traveling would take me I'd also have to wait around for 3 hrs alone for the train if I decided to go with this one.\n\nThe other option would be to take an earlier train to avoid the waiting around, but the one available in that case would have me wait in the capital for several hours in the middle of the night instead, before switching train twice to get to my home town. This would have taken 11 hrs.\n\nUpon realizing this I suggested maybe it's better to wait with this trip until we have more time because I feel like the travel time isn't worth it for barely two days together. Am I a bad person for this?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

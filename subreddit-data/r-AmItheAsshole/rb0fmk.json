Before me he was together with his HS sweetheart. They fell out of love and broke up. A year later we started dating. His mom however was still heartbroken about it. I was very understanding and thought she needed time to get to know me. The ex basically grew up with them and they saw her as a part of the family. \n\nFor the first year of my relationship his mom would call me ex\u2019s name, until bf got angry once and told her to be nice. She laughed it off and said it was just a habit. After that she started calling me the wrong name. (Janet instead of Jenny; fictional names just for the story). I corrected her a couple of times but she seemed to like hurting me so I ignored it later.\n\nMy bf has two sisters and a couple of weeks before thanksgiving we were invited to bbq at the older sister\u2019s house. I was in the kitchen with my bf\u2019s mom, the sisters and one of their husbands. The older sister then talked about how my BF praised my cooking to her husband and the mom was listening. She then said iut loud \u201cSURE! Why don\u2019t we let Janet make the turkey this year?\u201d. The sisters giggled and looked at each other and I said \u201cthats a great idea!\u201d I didn\u2019t tell my bf what happened.\n\nOn thanksgiving we went to his mom\u2019s house with the usual wine and dessert. She was shocked l, everybody was shocked. I said \u201cwhat? I thought Janet is bringing the turkey!\u201d. There was yelling, crying and then we got kicked out. My bf is so angry with me he hasn\u2019t talked to me since. I think it\u2019s over tbh. But I still don\u2019t think I did anything wrong! Did I?",

The guests usually bring side dishes. I\u2019m sure there are situations where a guest brings a turkey, but I would think they would require a lot more than a one-off comment, as you said.",

The only reason I think it wasn't malicious is that he also did the same damn thing to her cat, and I know he liked the cat. \n\nThis isn't even remotely close to excusable, this is a malicious 'renaming' as a power move.",

You're not allowed to come, I'd better not see you there!\" So he immediately starts getting ready and says \"I guess we better get going...\" So I said \"no, we're not going. You're sick, and she just uninvited us. We're doing what she told us, even if she meant the opposite. I'm not playing her manipulation game.\" So we stayed home, and sure enough, mil called later furious that we didn't come. A year or so later we moved two states away and cut contact.",

Turnabout is fair play. Had they respected you and called you by your given name I'm certain that they would have gotten their turkey.\n\nThey're just mad because their pettiness came back to bite them on the ass. You said that you didn't tell your bf what happened. Is he aware of the fact that his mother can't get your name right? You've been together two years, and his mother \\*still\\* can't get your name right? He allows this?\n\nIf so, then it may be time to rethink this relationship. You won't get any respect from his family if he tolerates their disrespect, and, In turn, disrespects you because he refuses to confront the issue with his mom.",

I think deep down you know that, but he pushed you to just accept \"thats just how she is\". That kind of behavior is how narcissists keep getting what they want, they have family that enables their bad behavior because a meltdown is \"worse\".\n\nYou have been suffering through her nonsense for 3 years, I think it was time for a blowup.

It's pretty but entirely justifiable given that your partners mom continues the aggression and your boyfriend allows it in any way. He should've confronted her and drawn boundary lines in the sand - treat you with respect, or he doesn't spend time with his family (extreme end of things, but clearly his mom is counting on everyone letting her do what she wants).\n\nI'm sorry, OP. Hope he can get his head out of his ass on this one and not give up your relationship, but if not, I hope you find a much, much better relationship where they'll stand up for you. You shouldn't have had to deal with this alone.",

This is how bullies operate.\n\nAnd really, their reaction was what blew up the holiday. So no turkey. Big deal. There was probably lots of food so no one starved. Other families have had no turkey (burnt, broken oven, deep fried caught the garage on fire). People shrug and move on. The reason MIL had such a fit is because she created the situation and it bit her. She was SO clever in always mocking OP and was going to rip her turkey to shreds and her own plan was turned against her. That's what blew up the holiday.",

They cared more about making you miserable, so that's what they decided to do. Your boyfriend grew up in that environment and probably thinks it's acceptable to attack people like that. It isn't.

Within one month of her moving in I had noticed that some of my plants looked like someone had taken a cutting. It was only one or two plants but I didn\u2019t think anything of it. A week later I noticed someone had taken a cutting from my pothos, this one only had 4 leaves so now I have 3 left, the new baby leaf had been taken.\n\nI decided to ask everyone in the house about it. The new girl admitted to it. I told her it\u2019s okay but to ask next time. Fast forward three weeks and more cuttings are missing, it\u2019s becoming noticeably even on my mature plants that are quite full! I knew it was her doing this but I had never seen what she is doing with them.\n\nToday I had to return her lighter to her after I used it. She wasn\u2019t home so I put it in her room and saw in the corner there was 15 pots with the cuttings from all different house plants along with 6 bottles full of water with more cuttings in them. \n\nAITA for being angry about this. I think I should confront her but my partner thinks I should just let this go! \n\n(I did spend a lot of time and money on these, especially the variegated ones, which I noticed she did take cuttings of )\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So if she\u2019s cutting to the point of harm, not cool.\n\nI\u2019ve attended a couple of hands on seminars on cloning/propagating plants from cuttings. Doesn\u2019t quite sound what she\u2019s doing, but the \u201cstealing\u201d theme of most of the answers thus far is cracking me up just a wee bit because of learning it. One cutting, some growth gel, and you could have 20+ new plants, exact clones, of whatever variegated anomaly you are keeping - you know this, right? Do look into it, it was quite fun and can fill a garden pretty darn quick!\n\nNTA",

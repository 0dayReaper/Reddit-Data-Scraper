    "postText": "My father just passed and it\u2019s obviously rough on the whole family. We are a large, blended, close-knit family of adopted siblings/nieces/nephews/children. \n\nMy adopted nieces and nephews (a 5 sibling group adopted by my sister) don\u2019t feel my sister always treats them all the same as her biological children. As their aunt, they ask me to often speak for them. It\u2019s never gone well when I do. So I haven\u2019t done so in awhile.\n\nDuring funeral planning, my sister, mother &amp; brother chose 6 pall bearers (my father\u2019s siblings, my brother, my sisters 2 bio kids and my sisters bf). None of the adopted sibling group were asked to participate. Collectively, they asked why a bf (whom they don\u2019t approve of because he has a felony record-whole other story) over them would be chosen. I told them I I didn\u2019t have a say and told them to ask their mom. \n\nThe group didn\u2019t want to cause heartache so they asked me to find out why but keep it confidential. I casually asked my sister (unfortunately if front of my mom) if we as a family should include one of the adopted sibling group to be a pall bearer over my sister\u2019s bf.\n\nMy sister blew up. \u201cWhere is this coming from? Which of my kids said to bring this up?\u201d I replied with, the sibling group often feels left out so I\u2019m just thinking we should include one over your bf because you\u2019ve only been dating 9 months and aren\u2019t married. \n\nMy mother chimed in and said she chose the people and can explain to the group why. I said it\u2019s not a big deal, just trying to include everyone.\n\nBecause she just lost her husband of 51 years, she began sobbing and ran outside, saying she doesn\u2019t want anyone to feel left out but arrangements are finalized. I felt awful that I made my mother cry, tried to help, but my mother wanted to be alone.\n\nMy sister became hostile, demanded me to tell her which of her kids brought this up, and told me off for making my mom cry.\n\nI responded that I\u2019m just trying to include the adopted children, I don\u2019t care who the pall bearers are and just wanted to give her children a voice and participation in the arrangements. I decided to leave but turned and said, \u201cI\u2019m honestly not trying to cause drama but am specifically trying to help you with your kids.\u201d And shit hit the fan.\n\nThe whole family is now irate at me for bringing unnecessary pain to my mother when all I was pointing out is that ALL the grandchildren should be equally included.\n\nI was going to do my father\u2019s eulogy, but wonder if I should back out and just let my brother do it because he is scheduled to speak anyway.\n\nMy brother called and is taking my sister\u2019s side, when there isn\u2019t even sides to take, saying I\u2019m causing unnecessary drama and sticking my nose is my sister\u2019s family. \n\nThe sibling group thanked me for sticking up for them and said this is why they choose not to tell their mom how they feel and confide in me. I\u2019m happy I helped them but am wondering if I AM an asshole for opening my mouth at all and causing unnecessary pain for my mother.\n\nAITA?!? I sure feel like it!",

But it sounds like you just asked a question, that seems to be a reasonable one. One of the adopted children probably should have been included. It was likely ok for you to ask. Upsetting your newly widowed mother is obviously not good and to be avoided if possible, but in balance asking about the inclusion of your nieces and nephews was reasonable.",

Sorry for the loss of your father and sorry also for the family discord caused by your reasonable question.  I don't see where you particularly did anything wrong.",

I don\u2019t know how old they were when they became a part of the family, but it\u2019s their grandfather that passed too.

You are \u201callowed\u201d to \u2018stick your nose in\u2019 the funeral planning for your father, you know. (And that\u2019s what you did here) NTA \n\nI too would be rather insulted by being overlooked as a member of the official funeral party by both my mother, my grandmother and siblings, and being replaced by a \u201cboyfriend-of-nine-months\u201d, and the only explanation is that nobody of the people planning sees the adoptive siblings as family. (And considering the comment about inviting former step-children of your sister, the boyfriend probably won\u2019t last long either)\n\nYour sister blowing up and demanding you narc on a specific sibling is probably a well established pattern of abuse in your sister\u2019s family dynamics, and I\u2019m guessing the adoptive siblings has been playing scapegoats all their childhood. That\u2019s why they don\u2019t talk to their mother about their feelings in this situation, because they have been thought their feelings are worth less than everyone else\u2019s. Good on you for trying to stand up for them.",

We are a large, blended, close-knit family of adopted siblings/nieces/nephews/children. \n\nMy adopted nieces and nephews (a 5 sibling group adopted by my sister) don\u2019t feel my sister always treats them all the same as her biological children. As their aunt, they ask me to often speak for them. It\u2019s never gone well when I do. So I haven\u2019t done so in awhile.\n\nDuring funeral planning, my sister, mother &amp; brother chose 6 pall bearers (my father\u2019s siblings, my brother, my sisters 2 bio kids and my sisters bf). None of the adopted sibling group were asked to participate. Collectively, they asked why a bf (whom they don\u2019t approve of because he has a felony record-whole other story) over them would be chosen. I told them I I didn\u2019t have a say and told them to ask their mom. \n\nThe group didn\u2019t want to cause heartache so they asked me to find out why but keep it confidential. I casually asked my sister (unfortunately if front of my mom) if we as a family should include one of the adopted sibling group to be a pall bearer over my sister\u2019s bf.\n\nMy sister blew up. \u201cWhere is this coming from? Which of my kids said to bring this up?\u201d I replied with, the sibling group often feels left out so I\u2019m just thinking we should include one over your bf because you\u2019ve only been dating 9 months and aren\u2019t married. \n\nMy mother chimed in and said she chose the people and can explain to the group why. I said it\u2019s not a big deal, just trying to include everyone.\n\nBecause she just lost her husband of 51 years, she began sobbing and ran outside, saying she doesn\u2019t want anyone to feel left out but arrangements are finalized. I felt awful that I made my mother cry, tried to help, but my mother wanted to be alone.\n\nMy sister became hostile, demanded me to tell her which of her kids brought this up, and told me off for making my mom cry.\n\nI responded that I\u2019m just trying to include the adopted children, I don\u2019t care who the pall bearers are and just wanted to give her children a voice and participation in the arrangements. I decided to leave but turned and said, \u201cI\u2019m honestly not trying to cause drama but am specifically trying to help you with your kids.\u201d And shit hit the fan.\n\nThe whole family is now irate at me for bringing unnecessary pain to my mother when all I was pointing out is that ALL the grandchildren should be equally included.\n\nI was going to do my father\u2019s eulogy, but wonder if I should back out and just let my brother do it because he is scheduled to speak anyway.\n\nMy brother called and is taking my sister\u2019s side, when there isn\u2019t even sides to take, saying I\u2019m causing unnecessary drama and sticking my nose is my sister\u2019s family. \n\nThe sibling group thanked me for sticking up for them and said this is why they choose not to tell their mom how they feel and confide in me. I\u2019m happy I helped them but am wondering if I AM an asshole for opening my mouth at all and causing unnecessary pain for my mother.\n\nAITA?!? I sure feel like it!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

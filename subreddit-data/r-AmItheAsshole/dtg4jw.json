    "postText": "I (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. My boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. He gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. I'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.\n\nHowever, there's one girl in our class, let's call her Victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. She goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. I know this is the case, because I've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.\n\nI've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and I don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. However, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. I rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. She was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him I was there too.\n\nVictoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. I snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. You're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'\n\nShe looked super embarrassed and walked away, and I later heard she'd gone home crying. I feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. AITA?\n\nEdit: She 100% knows that I am his girlfriend, I have heard her talking about me being his girlfriend before.",

Pretty much any response will get you some \u201cYTA but understandable\u201d answers. Not responding to assholes can lead to people being doormats, which is something imo this sub struggles with. Assholes often aren\u2019t interested in calm rational discussions, and sometimes you gotta call an asshole out to make a point, as is the case here.\n\nEdit: case in point, the fourth response at this time is esh because you could\u2019ve responded better. Fuck that noise, if someone comes in with the disrespect blasting like this you should feel justified in putting a bitch in her place. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes, and goddamn is hitting a dude in front of his gf playing a stupid game.\n\nEdit 3: the idiom is case in point, and the idiom turning the other cheek comes from Roman times and indicated you saw the other person as an equal and slapped them open palmed, as opposed to backhanding someone you saw as lesser.

Sometimes I can be a real asshole, but I think it's a necessary part of life and don't see myself as a bad person. So I might say, \"Yeah you were an asshole just now, and I know that's hard and you feel bad, but you did the right thing.\" I think that is how OP is feeling right now too. Hurting other people is never fun, unless you are a Definition 1 Asshole.",

By her partner being silent and claiming \"duhh I didn't know that!!\" .. is not going to work. Otherwise his silence is deemed as accepting of that behavior even if he claims he's not inviting or accepting it. I'll give you a great example: Attractive women with the RB face. They rarely get approached by men, NOT BECAUSE their boyfriends/husbands fight off every man. Nope. It's because they don't invite that kind of attention.\n\nYou're going to keep fighting off women until your BF starts sending off those \"keep away from me\" signals.",

She would do anything to get his attention and he wouldn't see it. It was just the whole 'I dunno if she does like me, and anyway I like you so it doesn't matter' situation. He wouldbe polite to her, because she was a little younger, and that just lead her on more.\nOne day I finally snapped.\nWe were all at a group event and him and I had a wee argument. I walked off and as soon as I did, she took the opportunity to go in and say that she would never hurt him, that they'd be a great couple and that he should just break up with me then and there.\n\nA friend of his overheard and came straight to me. I made up with my boyfriend then I rounded on her. Told her to stop being so disrespectful and that I wasn't having it anymore. I think my boyfriend realised too that enough was enough. She was super embarrassed, and went home.\nI found out later that she'd apologised and asked him to apologise to me as well. She thought that because I was older, I was going to beat her up if she didn't stop.\nHe ended up telling her that he wasn't going to break up with me, he wasn't interested in her that way and to stop otherwise they wouldn't be friends.\n\nOP, your boyfriend needs to stand up and tell her.",

It's like criticizing an abuse victim for not \"Just leaving\". We shouldn't expect perfect rationality from people in arduous circumstances.",

    "postText": "Okay, so my bestfriend of 7 years is in a very toxic relationship. She is very serious about this guy and plans to marry him one day. We've been friends through thick and thin, and I'll always love her. So, everytime they fight(he usually initiates the fight because of silly little things) he calls me and vents and starts degrading her. This has happened a couple times. They fight in my presence and then make up the next day. I don't approve of her giving him so many chances and she knows it. He doesn't trust her at all, he's always suspicious about her guy friends and has made her cut ties with them. Recently, my bestie and I was talking from 10-11 pm. A while after she hung up, her bf calls me and tells me 'Why are you talking to her after 9, you're causing unnecessary problems in our relationship, don't call her after 9\" very rudely and hangs up. I tell my friend about this and she fights with him. The thing is, I am a very sensitive person who is recovering from depression. Things like this can easily push over the edge. My bestie tells me that she's going to break up with him, but two days later they're back together again and happier than ever. All this while he still hasn't made any effort to apologise to me. I decide to set boundaries with the couple because this entire situation is very unsettling to me and there is no way in hell I am going to stand someone disrespecting me idc who it is. I told her that I need a break from the friendship and now she's mad at me. I also feel guilty because am I manipulating her? Am I making her feel bad? Am I the asshole here? \n\n\nTldr : Best friend's toxic boyfriend is being crappy towards me,  I distanced myself from the friendship and now my friend is mad at me",

If they get married, he'll start battering her in....3 years, tops, give or take half a year. \n\n&gt; Why are you talking to her after 9, you're causing unnecessary problems in our relationship, don't call her after 9\n\nMy mum talks to people till midnight. Including my dad. Night time's their favourite chat time cos mum's an entrepreneur (catering jobs) and has to promote her business online. Dad's in one of the bank's departments(can't remember which...I think it's the statistics dept) and works long hours. So yeah. Midnight is the best for jokes",

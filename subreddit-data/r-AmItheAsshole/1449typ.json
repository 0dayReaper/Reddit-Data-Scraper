    "postText": "Sounds click bait, it's not. I (30s F) come from a country where it is customary to wash your bottom after you go number two. It is a standard practice like in many other countries, and every household has bathrooms with bidets. I currently live in an european country where it is not that common, but you can still find a few houses that do have a bidet, and some people here wash, and others wipe, but neither choice is strange to the other group. I happen to live in a house with 2 bathooms: a small one with a toilet and a sink, and a large one that also has bathtub and a bidet. When I have guests, I usually point them to the small bathroom but only because is closer to the area we usually hang out.\n\n  \nLast weekend my wife (40s) and I had a bunch of friends over for a bbq since the weather is nice and we have a terrace. One of my friends brought Kelly (30s, not real name) who is from the US and I've never met before. Everything was going well and I thought Kelly was nice. I was grilling sausages and at one point I take one out to give it to someone and I drop it on Kelly's feet, who was wearing flip flops. I appologise profusely and handed Kelly a napkin, she said not to worry but she preferred to wash, so she leaves while I stay in the terrace cleaning the floor. \n\n  \nShe comes back a moment later and comments on \"how cute that our bathroom has a little feet washer\". My wife and I were like what? and when she repeats I say \"Oh you mean the bidet?\" Kelly did not know what a bidet was, and when I explained to her she was shocked, and asked if we actually use it to wash after going to the toilet, and I say that my wife doesn't (she's from a country where this is not common) but I do, and that's when she lost it. She got agitated and furious and asking how come we didn't tell her? To which I said I've never had to explain to anyone what a bidet was before. She said we should've warned her, that we need to warn our guests that I wash my behind there, that it is not \"normal\" and that I was an AH. I started naming some of the many, many countries that do wash as a cultural norm while also stating that here, even if people don't have one, everyone knows what it is, but she completely went nuts when she realized that the little towel hanging next to it is for drying my bottom. Seems like she used it to dry her feet and hands. \n\n  \nShe left shortly after, along with my friend. I don't think I did anything wrong, my wife thinks the same, but my friend said that I should've apologised and another friend said she understood Kelly's point. AITA??  I want to note that the bidet was clean\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add that the \"poop towel\" as ppl are referring to, is the size of a napking, and it hangs directly next to the bidet at about 40cm from the floor, so I dont see how anybody could mistake it for a normal towel. Also, we don't share the towel, each person has their own, is just that I am the only one who uses the bidet therefore only one towel. Last, the towel dries you after you clean, there is no poop, just like when you get out of the shower. \n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for all your replies, I am trying to read them all. Special thanks to whoever awarded the poop knife! I heard today that Kelly is going back to the US  so I win't be seeing her again.",

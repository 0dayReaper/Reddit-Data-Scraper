On two different occasions before tonight I've come home from work late at night and had to walk next-door and ask them to move their car so I could pull into to my own home.

It may be that they think that you are OK knocking and asking them to move.\n\n7-10 car at their house, plus the ones on your drive.  Are they having a swingers party or something?  This isn't sour grapes about not being invited - no offence meant, just checking /s\n\nBut seriously - put a sign up saying it's \"private land, no parking, gate may be locked at any time and unlocked at undetermined periods\".  I don't know if you are allowed to put a barrier across the front of the drive - such as a gate or a  big plastic coated yellow chain - to physically highlight the fact and so that if they go to release the barrier they have to stand in front of the sign to do so? OK, this is an expense and it also means you have to get out and undo the barrier to open it yourself.   I'm assuming that you are in the US and I know that neighbourhoods have their own rules about boundaries, gates etc.\n\nIf you have told then not to have their friends park on your drive then call the cops and have them towed.  In the UK the cops won't do anything on private land.",

    "postText": "My husband and I have been the ones flying to either MIL or SIL\u2019s houses in the last 14 years for once every year so we could join gatherings of the extended family. I was okay with that since back then, we only had one child (then the youngest grandkid) while both SILs have five kids between them and they\u2019re all on the East Coast. We\u2019re on the Pacific.\n\nNow, all their kids are over 10 years old while my husband and I have three kids, two of which are still very young toddlers in diapers. Flights are also getting expensive. Road trips are not an option.\n\nRecently, the subject of once a year visit came and I told MIL via text that if she wants to see her son and grandkids, she should make an effort. MIL and FIL had only ever flown to our city twice in the last 14 years, and each time, we had to pay for their tickets round trip and accommodate them in our house. They do cook some of the meals and don\u2019t really require maintenance or entertainment.\n\nSILs texted back in the group chat and said that they don\u2019t fly to us since we can\u2019t all fit in my house and they\u2019re not paying for a hotel, while if we\u2019re the ones to go to the East Coast, their houses are large enough to fit everyone. MIL and FIL in their 70\u2019s are not stressed out to travel either if we are the ones flying to them.\n\nSo AITA for being blunt and challenging MIL?\n\nEdit: Our nine-year-old also recently got diagnosed with an autoimmune disease so we\u2019re not planning to put him on the plane for the longest time.\n\nAlso, my husband is on my side and is tired.",

    "postText": "So, to start off my mom is not a very pleasant woman (picture Precious\u2019s mom but with more gaslighting) and I am moving in 4 days. 4 years ago I (26F) met a very wonderful and very sweet man and I love him with all my heart. He unfortunately had to move to another state but he didn\u2019t want to leave me behind but I told him that next year I will be with him. I couldn\u2019t move with because my family bought a house the year prior and I just started a new job so I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea at the time. I live in FL and I absolutely HATE IT here. When my family moved me here 20 yrs ago the first I asked was \u201c can we move back to MI?\u201d Last year when my boyfriend was in the process of moving I sat down my parents, my mom (42) and grandmother, and told them that a year from now I will be moving out. My grandmother was quiet, like she usually is, but to make a long story short my mother basically told me that if I ever leave her I can never come back and I\u2019m never going to amount to anything except for being on my back and other things but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re appropriate to say on Reddit. Obviously, I was very devastated and I told my boyfriend what had occurred and he was more than PO\u2018d and wanted to give my mother a piece of his mind, but I told him to don\u2019t engage, and he is still mad to this day. However, after that conversation I had with my parents, I knew that it was time for me to go and I never brought it up again. Now a year later, I told my grandmother that I am moving out in a couple days and she told me that \u201cI am not happy to see you go but I understand it and at the end of the day you are a very capable adult and I\u2019m not going to stop you. The only thing that I\u2019m gonna tell you is that I want you to be happy and you are responsible for your own choices.\u201d Then she asked me when are you going to tell your mom and I told her that after what happened last year she doesn\u2019t deserve a heart to heart or a goodbye and I\u2019m gonna be like \u201cpeace out, yo!\u201d She shrugged and said nothing. I\u2019m really excited to leave however, I do feel a little guilty not telling my mother that I\u2019m leaving, so WIBTA for not telling her sooner?",

They had 2 children together (10F and 8M).\n\n Her ex was SAHD while she was the breadwinner, he went back to work when the youngest turned 5. Because he spent almost 7 years without working, he went back to work earning much less than my sister. For comparative and completely fictitious values, she earns 2k and he earns 700.\n\nAbout custody, it was stipulated that he would be entitled to weekends and would have to pay child support, which is a low amount. That's what I knew. \n\nRecently, she and her children visited me to have dinner and play with my children.\n\n I'm a divorced mother too. \n\nWhile our children were playing, in one of our conversations I mentioned that I had to thank my children's faghrr for giving even more than what the judge decided, because I was able to pay for extra classes for them or even save money, because it's extra money. \n\nShe answers me something, paraphrasing, when the judge decided what the value was, I already sent a message to my ex saying that this laughable value did not need to be sent, because I am well able to manage without it. I don't need his money.\n\nI stayed quiet, not wanting to comment, but she insisted I speak what was on my mind.\n\n I was sincere and that I thought it was a selfish decision, because that money was her children's right, whether it was little or not, they had the right to receive it and if that money didn't make a difference, she should still accept it even if it was for keep the money in an account, but never deny money that is for them and not for her. And that I understand her act that, but that she should preserve the rights and interests of her children first.\n\n She didn't say anything after that and walked away. Later she sent a message saying that I , as a sister, should support her on this journey of being a divorced mother and not criticize her actions that think of the children. \n\nMy parents are saying that I crossed the line, but we always had a sincere relationship and that allowed me to say that (she herself already gave me  reality  check). \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

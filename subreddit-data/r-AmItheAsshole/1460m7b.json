    "postText": "\nHi Guys, \n\nThis a bit off story please bare with me.\n\nSo we got married in February so we are somewhat newly married. Me and my husband went to a friend's marriage so were traveling for 3 whole days.\n\nMy mother-in-law side relative(let us call her x) was bit a off from the starting. Before my friend's marriage she invited herself to our house will her husband, two sons and their parents. I would have said yes if it didn't collide with my friend's marriage. Me and my husband had a discussion and said no very clearly.\n\nAnd back to the day when we returned for the marriage. We were very tired and wanted to take a day off and relax. But out of no where x calls us asks us if she and all the other people mentioned above like literally 6 people stay with us for 4 days. We clearly told her we are tired and want to rest so we asked we book then a hotel and take of all other expense. But after 2 minutes of this conversation I get a call for x's son asking for our location telling they are on their way.\n\nAnd let Me tell you, they as expecting me to make them 3 course meals daily and take care of x's in-laws. All in while being newly married and tired from all this traveling.\n\nX calls my mother-in-law and complains about me. Now my mother-in-law in furious and calling me names for not taking care of them.\nPlease tell me if I am being an A hole",

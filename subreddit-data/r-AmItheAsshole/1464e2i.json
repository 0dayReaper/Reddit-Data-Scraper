    "postText": "I (20f) have a disability (toxoplasmosis) and it prevents me from getting a job since most jobs aren\u2019t so considering. \n\nFor more context i come from a very religious background and here girls don\u2019t move out unless married so moving out isn\u2019t much of an option here\n\n\nSo i receive a sum of money from disability allowance and that\u2019s the only way I could pay for my own things, up until I was 18 my dad had access to it and after I turned 18 I took control of it \n\nMy dad wasn\u2019t happy about it at all and demanded I don\u2019t use a penny, saying i need to save for my surgery (nose and eyes) \n\n1. Toxoplasmosis isn\u2019t curable so far but need an eye check up every 6 months \n\n2. I used that money to buy necessary things and also to take tickets to another city so I could do my nose surgery ( for medical purposes) and i did not tell that I used the money when they asked \n\n\nA few days before surgery my dad asked me to tell him my bank balance and I refused to, it kept going for two days and he decided to ask his best friend who works at a bank to check my balance. The \"friend\u201d told him everything and gave him the bank statement \n\nOut of anger I filled a complaint against the staff and got him fired \n\nNow everyone in the extended family wants me to apologize to my dad and asked me to find a way to get his best friend his job back\n\n\n\nI now live with my one of my mom\u2019s younger sister \nEveryone in my extended family thinks I\u2019m an asshole except my aunts \n\n\nSo reddit, AITA for filing a complaint against my dad\u2019s best friend?",

Unless you're immunosuppressed (weakened immune system) pyrimethamine and sulphonamides help fighting the infection (and you take folinic acid in conjunction to minimize the negatives of treatment) and the remaining cysts usually don't \"reactivate\" as long as your immune system is intact. If your immune system is not working correctly (continued toxoplasmosis outbreaks) it's important to find out why it isn't doing its job.\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/health\\_professionals/index.html#tx](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/health_professionals/index.html#tx)",

Also the fact that apparently jobs won't consider her might be due to them believing she's infectious (but it might also be due to certain impairments).\n\nDepending on the medical knowledge of the people in her vicinity she might not know that it's treatable, and she also might not know that, if it is a recurring breakout, that it might be a sign of an impaired immune system. I posted my commend due to the \"better safe than sorry\" approach.",

Because he had been affected once, it could always come back. When we got a cat, he couldn't scoop the litter and we made sure it didn't go outside (wouldn't have been feasible in our apartment anyway). His eyes also got gradually worse with age, he was 30 when we broke up and was dealing with the reality that he will be blind at some point. He already had very bad vision, needed special accommodation at work and was never allowed to drive. Surgically, there couldn't be anything done for him, i think the scarred areas inside the eyes were too big. He never mentioned medication, but i don't think it would've been an option as the main issue was the consequences of the first infection.",

Toxoplasmosis isn\u2019t curable so far but need an eye check up every 6 months \n\n2. I used that money to buy necessary things and also to take tickets to another city so I could do my nose surgery ( for medical purposes) and i did not tell that I used the money when they asked \n\n\nA few days before surgery my dad asked me to tell him my bank balance and I refused to, it kept going for two days and he decided to ask his best friend who works at a bank to check my balance.

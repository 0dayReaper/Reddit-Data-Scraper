She was dirty. My MIL freaked out and screamed at her, what is wrong with you?! You not supposed to be dirty and she was calling my daughter stupid . So I told my MIL to screw off and she can leave the house. And she went home pissed \n\nMy husband agreed with me and say I did the right thing. His dad and his sister send me angry messages saying how I am idiot for kicking her out",

Doesn't sound like you or your husband extended an invitation to this vile woman. This is such an old-fashioned thing to do: show up unannounced, uninvited, and camp until the baby is born. This is the same behavior of someone who will insist being in the delivery room when you have no intention of asking them to be there. Gross.\n\nThree, your FIL and SIL are just mad that you sent her packing because they thought they were going to get a break from her. She sounds like she's awful to be around.",

That kind of criticism and screaming can be permanently damaging for a child, and I hope that she and anyone else who thinks it's okay to treat children this way will re-examine their attitude. It would be better for your kids' self esteem and mental health if she doesn't live with you, especially at a time when their world is about to be changed by a new baby in the house. Congratulations on the new baby and may it be happy and healthy!",

    "postText": "So I had this close friend of mine I met online. We spent a lot of time together for around a year and had a lot of deep conversations about ourselves. After that year past she started getting very busy and at the time I didn't know what was going on so for the 2 months she wasn't able to respond I would dm her stuff. Any stuff like I sent photos talked about some TV shows I watched and I also sent her longish happy birthday message. Now recently with summer she is a lot less stressed and will sometimes dm me that they are free again like once a week which I am perfectly fine with. \n\nI wanna point out I did also send a message during her 2 months break that was basically a \"Where are you?\" and then she responded a lil later and talked about how she's doing a lot right now and that is when I found out why she was inactive.\n\nSo as we were like talking another night ago we had a bit of an argument about twitch. Basically she wanted to start one and I was like great and started giving her some advice on it and one point was \"Followers don't really matter\" but then she says \"that's not true but ok lol\". Now for context here I have a bunch of twitch experience which she also knows about and she has only casted and not really streamed on her own much before so I was trying to help but after she said that I got annoyed and said gn and left.\n\nNow last night I decided to have a very difficult conversation about like our friendship. The twitch discussion we kinda resolved because she said she already knew that stuff but didn't say it at the moment so it was mainly miscommunication. But then I talked about of she ever read my older messages from those 2 months. She said no and I talked about how I understand that she is extremely busy but also asked if she even thought about checking back or even reading the birthday message. She said she thought about it a little bit but didn't. And she also said that after those 2 months she's been trying to find some footing and like spend less time online.\n\nSo again I said I understand and said that whenever you dm me to get on then at that time you can scroll up to those old messages and read them and that it'll only take a few minutes. She got angry and left, and now she's blocked me.\n\nThis person was my bestie but I don't know I always felt it was one sided which is why I wanted to talk about the friendship like this but did I mess something up?",

I feel like the twitch conversation was resolved cause we both just miscommunicated there. I just included it because it made me wanna talk about the stuff I said afterwards. \n\nI tried being the least entitled I could be since I gave her lots of space when I learned why she went inactive. There is also a lot more to that talk then just like talking about reading my old messages. But if it does seem that way then ig that could be the issue?",

Seeing as how she lives in a different state, we never get to see each other and so I thought it would be nice to hang out with her for a part of a day that I was on the trip.\n\nMy family was fine with it so yesterday, which was the last full day of the trip, I headed out to her apartment around 1. We ended up going out at night and we hit a few bars. She knew I had a flight the next morning and so I didn\u2019t want to stay out super lae, though I hadn\u2019t given her a specific time.\n\nAround 10:30 my sister called me from the hotel and was worried about where I was. She has anxiety and so I told my friend I should probably head back and she got pretty upset. She told me we could stay out but just not drink, however at that point I wasn\u2019t feeling great and wanted to be back with my sister. \n\nShe called an Uber but the whole time I was waiting for mine she was being really passive aggressive. I asked if she would be ok going home and she just said \u201cyes, I have an Uber.\u201d \n\nI feel bad because I think she thought we\u2019d stay later, but realistically I wasn\u2019t going to stay out past midnight at the latest. Am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

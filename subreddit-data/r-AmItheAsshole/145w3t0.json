    "postText": "My friend (23 F) and I (23 F) have been close friends for about 4 years. Before I moved across the country with my now husband last year she got engaged and asked me to be a bridesmaid. I happily accepted. I talked on the phone today with her and she told me that she had a \u201cbone to pick\u201d with me. She\u2019s upset that I won\u2019t come to her bachelorette party because it\u2019s too expensive, but then I will spend money on a tattoo. Let me explain further\u2026 I\u2019ve been going through some crazy health issues that resulted in me not being able to walk for a while. After 6 months of going through hell I finally feel like I\u2019m getting better thanks to physical therapy and medications. I haven\u2019t done anything for myself since I got married last year or since my health issues occurred. I haven\u2019t even gotten myself a new shirt, so I don\u2019t think treating myself every once and a while is unreasonable. Since my friend and I had this conversation I feel like what I\u2019ve done isn\u2019t good enough just because I can\u2019t go to the bachelorette party that\u2019s across the country from me. I\u2019ve spent in total $1700 (that includes flights, pet care, bridesmaid dress, shoes, etc.) that I don\u2019t really have to be able to be there for her on her special day, which I want to say I don\u2019t AT ALL mind to do. I\u2019m actually thrilled to do it so I\u2019m able to be there for her because I cherish our friendship, but she\u2019s making me feel like I\u2019m the asshole for getting a tattoo / treating myself and not going to her bachelorette party. And I\u2019ve done the math and it would cost me another grand (if you include flights, hotel, Uber rides, food, drinks, etc.) to make that happen and I just don\u2019t have that kind of money. So\u2026 am I the asshole in this situation?",

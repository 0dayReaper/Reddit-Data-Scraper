As a GM, it was not out of the ordinary for me to work 100 hour weeks and triple shifts (that\u2019s 24 hours straight). I burnt out and left, but not before a colleague of mine, who was under similar stress, had a psychotic break and passed away suddenly. A few years after I left, there was a class-action lawsuit against the company brought to them by several dozen current and former managers that forced the company to change their policy.\n\nYou mentioned that she signed a contract with the Taco Chain. Did that contract stipulate the hours she is expected to work? It\u2019s alarming to me that a contract like that would force an employee to work those kind of hours.\n\nPlease support whatever decision she makes, and hopefully she\u2019ll choose health and the life you two are building together. \n\nAnd tell her, from this friendly random internet stranger, that it\u2019s truly not worth it.",

We've had several discussions in the past about having children and getting married, so I think it's going well for her as well. Before this it's been a 50/50 split on all of our expenses. Yes, I would continue to support her if she didn't find a job and we broke up, I'm not a monster. \n\nShe constantly talks about being offered raises and promotions at her job,  but reinforces the statement by saying that the company never gives the position of Store Manager or anything on the corporate level to women.  So I'm unsure how much upward mobility she actually has. It's not how much she's making that bothers her about leaving her job,  it's being dependent on me and my income to keep her from debt/homelessness. She's spent a very large part of her life supporting others, I think the idea of asking for help is hard for her.",

The job market is pretty tough and she may not feel 100% ready to move on from her workplace. Or she may have some past experiences that make her not feel like she can rely on another person and may need a lot of reassurance to do that.\n\nBut I think you sound very mindful and kind; your heart seems like its in the right place and I hope she can put her trust in you to help her through this!

I'm very doubtful as it's a taco chain, and given her experience and time in her current position she should've leveraged some type of deal for covering the spread left by what is actually the jobs of 7 people. Yes, roughly 7 people because there should be at least 4 other people in management, including the GM, and at least 2 shift leaders. I've worked in food, and notably higher ups are in high demand, but the GM will attempt to make things work with 1 person doing the job of two.\n\nIf they even hold true to their word and hire managers in at the time they predicted I would redirect the conversation as \"if you wanna stay that's fine, but for your own wellbeing you should request a week off to recover.\" She's might be willing to see reason in that hopefully, as most people would be demanding a paid vacation immediately after covering this overexcessive work schedule.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy(38M) girlfriend (34F) works as a shift manager for a small chain of taco restaurants in our city. She has worked there for about 5 years now, however recently the entire work environment has changed dramatically and the demands of her work have caused her to constantly choose between her job and her relationship with me and many times her own health. \n\nWhen we first started dating, she had a manageable schedule that we could plan dates around. However, within the last month, two other managers quit and a third was fired. To compensate, her job (which she signed a contract for) has demanded her to work 90+ hour work weeks with no days off. We hardly have any time to spend together and her schedule is so busy that her health has started to decline as a result. \n\nI work as a security guard and could more than comfortably take on the financial burden of keeping the rent and other bills paid on our apartment while she seeks new employment. However she insists that she would rather suffer at her current job instead of stressing out and being incredibly depressed searching for a new job.  I have done things like showing her other restaurants in town that would hire her (via indeed) and she avoids my explanations.  Personally I'm hurt because this situation is putting an enormous stress on our relationship but I love her so much that I don't know how to progress with my argument. She claims that this new workload will only last a few weeks while they hire new managers but it's already been a month of this and I've only seen people leave the job.  I don't know if it's right for me to convince her to leave even though I'm acting out of my own concern for her health. \n\nWIBTA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

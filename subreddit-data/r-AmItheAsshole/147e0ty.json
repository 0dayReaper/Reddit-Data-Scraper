    "postText": "I (26m) have been dating my (30f) girlfriend for about 5 years. We\u2019ve had a steady &amp; healthy relationship for a while until mid February of this year. I was not a good partner to her (dishonesty), and things went south for quite some time. We both had mental health issues to deal with regarding her abusive patterns to me in the beginning of our relationship, and I was very immature with the way that I handled dealing with it and did things out of spite to her, including lying.\n\nSince then, I have been going to therapy, addressing/caring for my mental health and checking in with her consistently to make sure that she is OK. Things have been slowly improving with each other regarding our feelings. We\u2019ve been able to talk to one another pretty openly about how we feel and where we are at, so this past month has felt better overall.\n\nShe is in a band that tours on the west coast from time to time, and during one of her shows in California I decided to visit some friends and come see her show as well. We both live in Seattle, so it isn\u2019t incredibly far away but I did fly.\n\nI decided give what I thought at the time was a small surprise, which would be to show up at rehearsal and say hi to her without saying I was going down to Cali. She did not take the surprise well at all, and we went on a walk together where she broke down crying and having a panic attack. I felt absolutely awful. \n\nShe said that I should\u2019ve told her, because she did not feel emotionally ready to see me so suddenly in the way she did. She is keeping her distance, and I am respecting that at this point. I should mention that she did not get much sleep the night before, so that could\u2019ve very well played into having such a strong emotional response. \n\nAITA for showing up so suddenly without telling her to surprise her, after we had a very rocky few months which has improved significantly in the past month.",

Please view our [voting guide here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what.2019s_with_these_acronyms.3F_what_do_they_mean.3F), and remember to use **only one** judgement in your comment.\n\nOP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:\n\n &gt; I flew out to surprise my girlfriend while she was working after we\u2019ve had a rocky couple of months since February. I thought it would be a little surprise, but she did not take it well at all and had a panic attack/was angry with what I did. I think this might make me the asshole because she feels that I should\u2019ve known she wasn\u2019t in the most solid mental state with how our relationship has been going up until relatively recently, therefore I should\u2019ve told her I was coming out. I thought that enough time has passed for us to feel normal enough to have a surprise happen and be excited or ok with it.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

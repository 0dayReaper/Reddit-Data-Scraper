I\u2019ve been a bit apprehensive ever since learning the full details, which admittedly may be my fault since I didn\u2019t really ask for specifics but agreed anyway. I just received the schedule and felt a bit strange since I would not actually be attending the school myself and struggled deciding whether to go or not. I decided to stick it out just to support him even if it did make me feel a bit uneasy/uncomfortable especially with all the awkward ice breakers i\u2019m sure i\u2019ll have to endure lol. But anyway, we agreed I would come over a day before just to hang out a bit beforehand. I woke up not feeling too well having a pretty tough mental breakdown the night before. There is a strong use of alcohol/weed in the area/groups we hang out and I really did not want to partake and knew I would likely feel pressured.  I decided it probably wasn\u2019t best for me to go over a day early and I told him I wanted to rest. I knew this would be difficult as my friend has pretty harsh anger issues and taking others perspectives. People often describe him as pressuring and extremely bossy. Knowing this I told him a soft lie just so I could get out of the situation. I got my wisdom teeth removed about a week ago so I just told him my teeth were hurting and I wanted one more day of rest. He freaked out and said \u201cwhat the fuck\u201d \u201cI bet you\u2019re not even going to come with me tomorrow\u201d. I tried explaining how I just felt I needed the day to myself but he didn\u2019t seem to understand and hung up and will not return calls or texts. \n\nAITA",

If you aren\u2019t attending the college, other students will be confused about your presence and your friend may come across as weird as he is meeting new people. Maybe hanging out at the hotel or apartment and supporting him between his orientation events would be a better balance? \n\nAlso, don\u2019t feel like you have to do anything you are uncomfortable with. Your friend should not expect you to hang out with people doing drugs if it makes you uncomfortable. Consider canceling all together if you don\u2019t feel the environment will be good for you. \n\nNAH\u2026unless someone forces you to do something you don\u2019t want to do",

If this was the case then please look after yourself first and don't worry about hurting his feelings.\n\nYou don't, however, seem to describe yourself in such a state. In fact you seemed to be able to make rational decisions OK (e.g. not wanting to partake in drugs, not wanting to go a day early, knowing that they wouldn't see it your way and planning a \"soft lie\").\n\nIf you really didn't want to go just say it to him, rather than concocting a story you risk getting caught out on.  Sure he may be peeved off with you but at least you'd be honest with him.   It sounds strange that he wants you to go with him anyway.",

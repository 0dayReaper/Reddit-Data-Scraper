This was planned so I was okay with him going to this show and me carrying the full load Monday after work and during the night. After work on Tuesday he didn\u2019t change any diapers, didn\u2019t make any bottles, he didn\u2019t hold the baby for more than 5 minutes, etc. So I did what needed to be done and once the baby was asleep in his crib we went to bed. Well throughout the night he was twitching (not from being asleep but because of the activities he chose to partake in), bad enough that it woke me up from a dead sleep. So I kept kicking him to tell him to roll over or turn or something to make it stop. So we go to work Wednesday, come home, and he tells me he\u2019s going to take a nap. So I went upstairs with him and started watching tv while bouncing/entertaining the baby. Well the baby started crying and fussing, as babies do, and he couldn\u2019t sleep because of it. So he started screaming at me saying that I\u2019m a b**ch, a narcissistic, and a liar and that I only care about myself. He told me to get out of the room and take the baby so he could catch up on sleep. I told him that it\u2019s not my fault he chose not to sleep and that him being tired doesn\u2019t mean he gets to not help me take care of our child. \nAITAH?",

    "postText": "This is a throwaway so for the sake of anonymity Im going to try and keep ages private. My brother and his fianc\u00e9 (F) have recently welcomed their first child into the world. She is beautiful and healthy. They wanted to announce her name and release photos on their own terms, so asked kindly if everyone who knew kept it private until they announced. Me (18F) and everyone who knew (my mother, the fianc\u00e9s mother, and all the siblings) understood, as they just had a child and wanted not only to rest, but to introduce their child in their own special way. Introducing your first child is such an honor none of us wanted to rob them of. And they weren\u2019t waiting that long to introduce the baby. They posted it less than 24 hours after her birth.\n\nMy moms best friend texted and asked for photos and name after the baby was born but before the announcement. My mom kindly asked the parents if she could tell her best friend who we will call Z. My brother and his fianc\u00e9 said \u201cmay you please wait\u201d and my mom said yes, not asking again. The topic was brushed off until later . \n\nMe and my mom went out to when we saw that the baby announcement was posted. We were so happy and my mom sent the post to Z. Z immediately starts calling my mom, yet my mom can\u2019t answer because me and her are out. Z then texts my mom saying \u201care you serious? I thought I was family. how come i had to wait to see her photos and know her name.\u201d Me and my mom were obviously confused as we explained earlier the parents wanted us to wait to tell anyone. My mom explains it\u2019s nothing personal before Z has her mom text my mom going off. Her mom said something like \u201cYou made Z cry you can never be forgiven for this\u201d. \n\nMe and my mom became angry, more so me. My moms upset because she\u2019s being attacked by multiple people for respecting her sons wishes. I\u2019m upset because not only is Z not even close to my brother, but she talks badly about my brothers fianc\u00e9 (THE MOTHER OF THE CHILD) and expects to have special treatment. How can you turn such a beautiful moment into an argument about YOU? My mom couldn\u2019t even tell her own siblings or her mom. \n\nZ has been posting about how fake my mom is and just bad mouthing her. I have typed out a whole thing to send her telling her how selfish she is, but my moms saying i shouldn\u2019t because she has a right to be upset. I get i could be the asshole if I send it while she\u2019s clearly upset. But im unsure as well, as she\u2019s been very nasty to everyone involved. WIBTA\n\nEDIT: The title i meant \u201ctell my aunt off\u201d sorry about the typo",

I miss them, sure, but I also am cheering them on for their accomplishments. I don't buy things for people expecting them to repay me, and I don't feel obligated to like or play a game just because someone decided to purchase it for me.\n\nHonestly if it was my Discord server and someone was treating me that way I'd kick them and send them a message that they can come back only if they stop being toxic.",

I cant really kick them, despite really wanting to, because I know that people mostly come there to play with them and I m only there to string along as a third wheel because even when I have the time to play I like niche things. I like wearing suits and vintage shit, my favourite singer is Will Wood and my favorite games are BioShock, Arcanum, The Mafia Trilogy and Persona games. So I cant really kick them lest I lose most contact with my friends.  \n\n\nEdit: grammar",

If you want to keep getting gifts from peers, you probably need to get them gifts too on special occasions and you need to thank them for gifts.

If your discord server has become mostly about him, then you can leave or you can kick him. I'm sure you can find friends with your tastes.",

But here goes. This friend of mine is a year older than me (I am 18). His entire life is based around video games, as was mine just a few years ago. This year I was quite busy, I was finishing high school and trying to get into a uni (successfully!) so I didnt have much time to play any video games. This friend bought me tons of them, not based on games I enjoy, but based on games he wants me see finished. One of them, Dark Souls 3, a game I recognize as great, but just isnt my cup of tea, took me a year and a half to finish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDue to me being accepted to university after high school I had to spend some time arranging things, since I am not only movies towns, but I m moving to a different country for university. But I promised the guy I d finally finish Dark Souls once that is taken care of. He already muted me on my own discord once before when I was preparing for high school finals. Now once I finished stuff I needed to arrange for uni I hopped on Discord only to find myself muted by him and completely and utterly ignored. Its so childish to me. Do I mean nothing to this person after years of friendship if I dont play video games with him? Mind you I finished Dark Souls despite him muting me, which was a week ago. We are now in the second week of him almost entirely cutting contact with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe still go to the same Discord and we still speak to the same people, its just difficult now that he has me muted and wont unmute me. Whenever someone asks why he muted me he says \"because\". Despite the fact that I know how childish this is and how petty this is I feel in the wrong. Why? Am I really in the wrong for simply not having the time to play and not necessarily wanting to play something I did not ask him to buy me anyway? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

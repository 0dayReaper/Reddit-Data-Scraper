    "postText": "I don't think I'm the asshole but I am concerned that I brought this to a head.\n\nMy (41m) brother (46 next week) has a lot of things going against him. He has dyslexia, bipolar. It's poorly managed and has epilepsy. That's not bad, well managed but it's part of his life (growing up he received a lot of attention for it and other behavioral problems). And addictions. \n\nHe got private school, cars, toys, when it was my birthday, he always had to get a big brother gift or the chaos would ensue.\n\nFast forward 30+ years. He's still getting pampered. He lives with a friend (f) rent free, no bills including food. She will buy him the beer even though it's a walk around the corner...she is a huge enabler. Like all of us (me included, for the sake of peace and because I knew nothing different). Now my dad (75) had back surgery and can't do things in the yard. He loves his gardens. Has worked years to get them full, and designed just so.\n\nAdditionally, my mom (71) has chemo infusions every Friday. So we schedule for me to take her in the morning and pick her up at the end of the day, pick up prescriptions, and run basic errands. My brother has offered to come to my parents (he's an hour and some away, I'm 20 minutes away) and do some yard work. He's unemployed, helping his roommate with her business, and I'm flexible in my work so this has been working out. \n\nExcept he's only ever mowing the lawn on the riding mower and never gets to anything else.\n\nSo Friday, two weeks ago, I have no chores or work to do so I go over and help with some stuff my dad wants my brother to do. I keep asking why it matters and he keeps saying it's because I do so much for them and he wants it to be fair. So anyway I get him to give me some things to do and get them all done. He wants my brother to do the rest or I need an extra set of hands to do it and dad can't. So I start mowing. Knowing my brother really wants to do it. Also knowing my dad wants a lot more done than the mowing. Problem solved because he doesn't show up until at least noon, usually closer to 1:30.\n\nI'm mowing the back yard, still plenty to do, and he pulls up seeing me before he pulls into the driveway. The next part was relayed to me by my dad because I was still mowing.\n\nHe said my brother stepped out of his car and screamed at him that if I was mowing he clearly didn't need him for help. My dad tried to explain all the other chores and that he could mow the other half of the yard. He screamed some more that he had more important things to do and drove off. \n\nSo, AITA for mowing despite knowing my brother wanted to? Did I cause this rift because we have all decided not to talk to him until he apologizes?  My parents want to give in and apologize to him. I think we need to stay strong and make him apologize to us.",

The way I read it seemed to imply that you chose mowing in order to leave him the other tasks that he'd neglected in previous weeks. \n\nHowever, this is your parents' home and ultimately it's their choice whether they want to invite him back. \n\nI'm sure that the work you're doing in the gardens means a great deal to your father. Mine are my pride and joy and it'd be heartbreaking to watch them go to hell while my kids went to war over some stupid grass.",

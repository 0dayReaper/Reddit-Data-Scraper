    "postText": "I (26F) have a 7 year old daughter. My ex (28M) wasn\u2019t involved in her life by his own choosing. Back in December, he reached out. It took some time, talking and a little therapy. He\u2019s been back in  our daughter\u2019s life for about 4 months now. We are working with the courts to establish paternity and for him to get custody. In the meantime, I\u2019ve let him visit her at my place. He\u2019s taken her on day trips. Since getting a bigger apartment, he\u2019s had her spend the night.\n\nHe was supposed to visit her Wednesday, have dinner with us and watch a movie. We try to do things the three of us, per the therapist\u2019s recommendation so she can see us get along. My ex said he\u2019d be over around 6:00.\n\nHe didn\u2019t show up. By 6:30, my daughter was hungry, so I fed her. I tried to put off the movie, but eventually let her watch it. She was disappointed about her dad not showing up. I put her to bed at 9. \n\n11:30, my ex calls, freaking out. He said he forgot we were supposed to have dinner. He only remembered because his girlfriend came home from work and asked how everything went. Rather than apologizing, he got mad at me and asked why I didn\u2019t call him. I said I\u2019m not going to chase him down. I already spent 9 months doing that when I was pregnant, begging him to be in her life.  I\u2019m not going to do that now. It\u2019s up to him to make an effort and remember this stuff.\n\nWe had therapy the next day and she\u2019s on my side. However, my ex insists that I should\u2019ve called. I\u2019m frustrated that he hasn\u2019t tried to apologize to our daughter. \n\nMy mom said that I should\u2019ve called. \n\nAITA?",

But we worked out a deal I'm satisfied with. \n\nI have a severe pain and fatigue disorder, which means -- among many other things -- that my ability to do physical household chores is seriously limited. Even when I can actually do them, it costs me so much in energy and time that I can't do anything else that day, pretty much. But I'm excellent at the mental labor tasks, and I even like them. \n\nSo we declared me the Household Manager. I'm everybody's memory, and the one who schedules appointments, and makes sure that chores which don't get done daily are done when they need to be, and everybody's birthday is remembered with enough advance notice to prepare for it. I have the authority to tell anyone in the house, my husband included, what needs done, and they listen the way they would to any managerial figure assigning work. And this is my full contribution to the household's chores (except parenting, which all the adults do, of course). \n\nI've paid off my share of the family workload with tasks that I can do from my bed, which is damn useful when I'm hurting too much to get out of it. And my family recognizes the value of this kind of labor enough to accept it in full and do the rest of the chores themselves.",

After he forgot family members' birthdays (like his own parents and brother), I put them in my google calendar so I could remind him.  Not a shared on, but my own.  He didn't ask, I just didn't want them to be upset again so I did it.  Why?  I still keep track of a lot of things, and nudge him to remember to use our shared calendars because I cannot be the only one responsible for two kids worth of stuff.  He's gotten better about it over the years and I'm grateful.",

He brought his girlfriend of 3 months with my friend\u2019s permission, since I was to be there and her husband. *His girlfriend* did more talking than he did, and she wasn\u2019t even trying to control the conversation or insert herself. Just constantly prompting him to bring up questions or answers one would expect a father to ask as *we tried discussing him starting to see his son again*. \n\nIt lasted less than 10 minutes, the first time any of us had seen him in over a year. Their son wasn\u2019t at the home, he was at his grandma\u2019s (friend\u2019s mom\u2019s) during the discussion.\n\nHe was already standoffish when they walked in, then you could feel the rage rolling off him when my friend said she\u2019d like to start with supervised visits before letting him take their son out. *Who hadn\u2019t seen his father in over a year after a traumatic event that led to the dad not seeing him. He is four years old.* Just at her house, spending time with their son and taking over bedtime routines to get him used to his dad.\n\nBro was not okay with it. As if he just expected to walk in and see his son and take him for the weekend. When she asked what he thought of it (to check in or prompt suggestions of activities he\u2019d like to do with their son), he said, **WORD FOR WORD**, \u201cWhat am I supposed say? No?\u201d\n\nAs soon as they left, we looked at each other in incredulity, then shrugged and said she wasn\u2019t going to try to drag things out of him. Not her circus, not her monkeys. I was more baffled that his girlfriend (again, of three months), contributed more to the discussion than him.",

Since it's Saturday, can you come home before dark?\" \n\nWell, talk about a question to hit a father right in the guilt! He explains that he said the only thing he possibly could say, which was \"Yes, sweetheart. I'll be home by *lunch.*\" \n\nThen he went in to his meeting with the senior partners who were running the case he was on, the men who ran the firm and could fire him as easily as they'd taken him on, and he told them, \"Let's keep it brief, gentlemen -- I have a lunch appointment that I can't miss.\" \n\nThey kept it brief, and he was home by 11:30. We spent the afternoon in the park. \n\nReal parents can be kept away, but they don't forget their kids.",

I was his only child.\n\nI stopped talking to him after that.",

If stress fortunate, the girlfriend will actually care and be a positive person in her life, if she sticks with dad long enough to matter.

He can\u2019t even bother to remember to put dinner with her into his own calendar. You need to see that he can be responsible and be where he\u2019s supposed to be for your child\u2019s safety. This is where you are deciding between agreeing to shared custody or fighting for limited visitation with safety protections in place so he doesn\u2019t forget your daughter somewhere. \n\nUse a shared calendar once he\u2019s shown he can be bothered to show up reliably, don\u2019t use it to protect him from his own irresponsibility and poor prioritizing.",

If he has visitation at that stage, he can just drift away. It'll hurt your daughter, but there's no way around that, and it will hurt her less, the less of a role in her life he's had in the first place. \n\nBut if he has partial custody, then he's stuck and so are you and your daughter, when he doesn't want to be a parent anymore and is likely to take it out on you and her. After all, that's what he did when he forgot to show up to dinner. \n\nBe VERY careful about giving away full parental rights to somebody you're not certain will adhere to full parental responsibilities.",

Your interest is mainly in not having to clean up his messes.   That's valid,  and if you think it's appropriate to let him fail in hopes he'll learn, fine.   But your kid was let down,  and over time,  that has an impact on her.  Her interests might be better served by taking small steps to ensure he shows up,  even if it's making a shared calendar invite for stuff he should be at - recitals,  school functions,  dinners.  \n\nI don't think you're necessarily wrong,  and you're sure as hell not responsible.  But I'd think about taking a few extra steps behind the scenes to spare your child some heartache.",

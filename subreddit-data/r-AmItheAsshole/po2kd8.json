You can be damn sure he's treated like a guest, he's known me longer than most of my guests have! Food, drink, formal invitation and all. I am going to try to get him to give up the camera for at least a snap or two so he can be included in some candid photos as well. (If not, because camera are expensive, someone else with a camera will take a couple shots for me.)\n\nWhen I asked as a general inquiry about how much wedding photos were, he gave me one price, then asked if it was for my wedding. I said yes, he quoted me half. I argued with him and got him to come up a little (60%), but when I tried to get him to come up more (75%), I was told that either I paid the price he gave me, or I paid the higher price I was trying to get him to come up to, but then he'd feel obligated to go buy me a $200 toaster, and please don't make him try to find a $200 toaster. He doesn't like shopping. Just take the discount as my wedding gift. \n\nIt was hard to argue with his logic. At least I got him from 50 to 60% so I don't feel like I'm totally robbing him.",

If you don't want us to leave, plan for a decent meal, which we'll wolf down in 10 minutes or less anyways. It's just normal decency to not let anybody go hungry if you want them at their best.",

We like to zoom through the line, wolf down the food and be back at work so we don't miss any important stuff. That's why photographers eat when the couple eats. It's not a power trip. It just makes sense logistically. \n\nTrust me, we don't want to mingle with your guests or \"be entertained\". All we want is sit in a quiet corner for a couple of minutes, rest our feet, eat some food and catch our breath.",

I would have done the same thing as well op. You didnt deserve that. \n\n\nHeck. I am getting married next year as long as covid isnt crazy again. And one of my questions for the venue was does the photographer get food and drinks too?  Cause even though im paying them i wanted to make sure everyone at my venue still got food, drinks, and possible breaks. Even if mine is only 4 hrs long. This. This was just ridiculous. If they come back and start to slander you and your business, be prepared for a possible lawsuit of defamation. Be careful op. Its possible they will do this if they treated you like they did at the wedding.",

By deleting them in front of the groom, there is zero confusion as to what happened to the photos. They\u2019re gone. He had his opportunity to recant his statements when she was deleting them, and he did not.\n\nLastly, many photographers take immense pride in their work (I can\u2019t say this is or is not the case with OP). Many would never release unedited photos. So, to release them, it might required an additional 4-8 hours of editing on top of the 8+ hours they already spent.

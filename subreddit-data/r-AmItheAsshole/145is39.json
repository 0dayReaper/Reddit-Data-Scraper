    "postText": "I (35F) am married to my husband (45M) who has a (16F) daughter\u2014my stepdaughter (who I will call Anne). We have full custody of Anne and her mom has stopped showing up to Anne\u2019s activities (plays, performances and school events). Previously her mom would attend events but would miss maybe 1 or 2. Now her mom misses all events.\n\n\nBackstory, we don\u2019t get along with mom but have NEVER made our opinions clear to my stepdaughter. When Anne and her mom fight, I always try to help Anne understand her moms side or at least help her to mend things. However her mom makes it\u2019s clear that she hates everything about us and try\u2019s to convince Anne that we are trying to steal her away from her. \n\n\nLast blow up was at Anne\u2019s band concert. There were two performances one at 6 and another at 8pm. Anne\u2019s dad and I attended the 6pm show because this day was her moms day so after the performance they would go have dinner. This is what they do every Tuesday\u2014her mom will pick her up and they will have dinner. Anne was so excited and had been practicing for months for this concert. After the 6pm concert her dad and I say hi to Anne and give her the flowers we got her. We see her mom and her husband so we leave to go to dinner. Once we get our food we get a text from Anne saying her mom left her at the concert and wasn\u2019t coming back because she got upset that Anne said hi to her friends before saying hi to her. I was furious that she could be so immature but I kept it together and we left dinner and picked her up.  \n\n\n\n\nThe following month Anne had a UIL performance for family and friends at her school. She invited her mom and told us that her plan was to make sure to say hi to her mom  first before she said anything to us or her friends. Internally I was screaming because it\u2019s ludicrous for a teenager to have to do emotional gymnastics for her mom but whatever. After the show we watched and waited for Anne while she looked for her mom\u2026who didn\u2019t even show.  Her mom texted her later to say it was Anne\u2019s fault for not being better at reminding her. Anne came home that night so upset and I was done being the peace maker and so I told her that her mom  needs to grow the hell up and stop being such a jerk especially if she wants a good relationship with her (Anne).  \n\n\n\n\nNow Anne wants to keep her mom at arms length and I feel like maybe I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. Was that an AH move on my part bc she\u2019s just a kid? AITA?",

If you stated it to relieve your frustration that is selfish so let's assume the intent reduced the repeated disappointments Anne experienced this Spring. If there is interest, a counselor/therapist can support Anne to unpack feelings and experiences. Learn skills and secure boundaries.  Mom requiring Anne to 'remind her' suggests she is manipulative and not accountable for her actions. Best to you all. \n\nINFO: \"Keep her mom at arms length...\". Do you mean she is distancing herself from her mom or she is trying to distance her mom to not interact with you (family unit).",

Maybe just sit down and have a conversation about it now that you\u2019re not as much in the heat of the moment. Like, you can explain it should never be a child\u2019s job to manage their parents emotions over saying hello first (or anyone\u2019s emotions- let\u2019s be honest, that would be troubling in a partner or friend, too), talk about how she wants to proceed, etc.",

The message that needs to be communicated to Anne is that these upsetting episodes is her mother is failing her, and not Anne failing her mother as mom is leading Anne to believe. My sister's step-kids have a mom like this. The kids get so upset when their mom bails that sis/BIL have started to explain that it's mom's job to see and spend time with them, and not the kids' jobs to jump through hoops to get mother-daughter time. Anne needs to hear that for the sake of her own self esteem, and she can decide for herself if her mom's a jerk or not.",

You may have been judgmental, letting your feelings get the best of you. That is not going to help Anne on her relationship with her mum.\n\nI do feel like you're in a difficult spot here, and, as i said, you're doing your absolute best.

Anne made an entirely reasonable choice based on the way she was being treated and while your validation of her feelings might have been the push she needed to establish boundaries it's hardly the primary cause and those boundaries are almost certainly going to be to her benefit regardless. She's old enough to have her own agency in her personal relationships and it sounds like she's made a pretty reasonable decision here. Trust her judgement.",

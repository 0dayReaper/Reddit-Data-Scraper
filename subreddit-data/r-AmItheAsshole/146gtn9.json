    "postText": "I was invited to a dinner party at a friends home. We\u2019ll call this friend Amy for the sake of this post. \n\nAs I said I was invited by Amy to her home for a dinner party and I of course brought 2 bottles of wine cuz there were 10 of us and I wanted to make sure everyone got at least a glass each. \n\nWhen we sat at the dinner table I realized my fork was a little dirty. I discreetly tried to wipe it clean with my napkin but whatever was on there wouldn\u2019t come off. \n\nI asked Amy if I could get a glass of water and I followed her into the kitchen and said that I needed a clean fork. She immediately got embarrassed. I told her no reason to be embarrassed stuff like this happens and it\u2019s no big deal. \n\nWe go back and enjoy dinner no one heard what was said. After I got home I got a nasty text from Amy\u2019s boyfriend, Matt saying I was an a$$hole for embarrassing Amy in front of everyone. \n\nI said that what I said was in private and no one heard. He claims I shouldn\u2019t have said anything and just use the dirty fork. Like what???\n\nSo AITA for asking in private for a clean fork?",

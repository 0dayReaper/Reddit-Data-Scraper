Just look at her and politely say, 'that's a bit rude of you to say, don't you think?' And walk away. Every time. I have used it on people like this, and I've only ever once heard someone do anything but splutter that they didn't mean to be rude. Walking away ends the conversation entirely, and sets a very clear boundary that you won't tolerate people being rude to you.\n\nIf she complains, you can tell your mother, 'I was perfectly polite. All I did was point out how rude she was being. Perhaps she shouldn't be rude in future, and people won't call her out on it.'",

Her friend has come over to our house again and is staying right now but I don't want to talk to her because the last time she was here she talked to my mom and criticised everything I did such as I don't have a proper job following graduation even though I'm freelancing right now plus I stay in my room too much and don't have any  activities. I like spending time alone but I do housework, help with gardening, babysit and pay my rent so I really don't like being criticised and I just don't want to talk to her friend while she's staying here.\n\nMy Mom really wants me to talk to her friend though, such as say Hi and make small talk so AITA for not talking to her?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

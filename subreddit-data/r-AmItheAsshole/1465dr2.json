    "postText": "I\u2019m (22F) a college student, home for summer break. My mom and stepdad are often away on weekends this month, and they\u2019ve asked me to take care of our pets (2 dogs, 2 cats, 2 snakes) and keep an eye on my younger siblings (15F &amp; 14M) while they\u2019re gone. My mom offered me $30 a day to do this. We\u2019ve done this deal in the past, and she\u2019s usually super chill about it; as long as everyone stays fed and safe, I\u2019m free to do whatever I want. I\u2019ve had friends come over, and I\u2019ve also gone out with friends for extended periods of time, and it\u2019s always been fine. \n\nWhen my school job needed people to work weekends in June, I said I could do it as long as I worked mornings, because then I\u2019d be home to feed my dogs before and after my shift. My job pays me $11 an hour (shifts are usually 6-8 hours), and I really need the money. \n\nI, admittedly, didn\u2019t discuss any of this with my mother, but I also didn\u2019t think much of it, as I\u2019ve been out for similar periods of time in the past and it\u2019s never been an issue. I also knew that at least one of my teenage siblings would be home while I was working, and I agreed to give them part of my earnings if they wound up having to feed or let out the animals while I was at work. \n\nHowever, my mom recently found out that I\u2019ll be working at my school job while she\u2019s gone, and she\u2019s really annoyed about it. She asked me why she\u2019s paying me if I\u2019m not even going to be home. For the record, I\u2019m making the 45 minute drive to and from my university to make sure I am still home when needed\u2014usually I would just stay nearby with my dad\u2019s side of the family on work weekends. But, apparently, there are a couple of events that my siblings and grandmother (who also lives with us) need to get to next weekend, and I\u2019m supposed to be at work, which means no one can take them. Admittedly, my mom thought I\u2019d be home, but she didn\u2019t tell me about those events until a couple of weeks ago, so I had no way of knowing that I would have to take them somewhere until long after my work schedule came out. Luckily, I wound up being able to get somebody to cover that weekend for me, which did solve that problem. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m still working this weekend, and my mother just now told me that she needs a ride to the bus stop tomorrow, but I\u2019ll be at work, so I told her I couldn\u2019t. She then got annoyed with me again, repeating that she doesn\u2019t understand why she\u2019s paying me if I\u2019m not even going to be home. I assured her that I would feed the animals before I leave and when I get home (which is what my parents do during the week when they\u2019re working), and that my sister could let them out if need be. She let the matter drop, and said she could drive herself to the bus stop, but I can tell she\u2019s still upset with me. \n\nI feel like I should apologize and maybe tell her not to pay me, but I also feel like I\u2019m not really doing anything wrong. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

Even more so with your grandma there. They should be able to take care of the pets, too.\n\nYou should just talk with your mom and explains that while you like helping, 30$ isn't enough for you to pay everything you need to. And that she needs to be more clear if there are times where she'll need you to step-up more or drive your siblings around.",

She can either feed them herself or pay someone else, like one of your siblings.

    "postText": "I know my dog (chihuahua mix) does not like children, but as long as they leave him alone he's fine. Even then if they do bother him he will give multiple warnings before actually biting someone. \n\nMy cousin (8) came over to stay at our (me and grandparents) house for a few days while her parents have a little vacation. I told her multiple times to leave him alone, but while I was in the shower she decide she wanted to go into my room where my dog was (bedroom door was shut) and play with him.\n\n I hear her start crying so I rush out of the shower and see he had bit her. Not hard enough to break skin, but you could see he had bit her. I told her she deserved it because I had told her multiple times to leave him alone. She goes crying to our grandparents, and now they are mad at me because my dog bit her. Even though she invaded his safe space, when she was told to leave him alone.",

They're bloody lucky it was your little chihuahua mix that was giving out the lesson and that your baby was still well mannered enough to make it a warning nip, and not a full blown bite.  What happens when your little cousin disrespects the boundaries of a dog that could do serious damage to them?  \n\nWe've never had a dog, and my spawnling LOVES dogs.  Due to that, she has been trained from the time she could walk on how to ask the owner, abide by their decision, and introduce herself **respectfully** to dogs.  She also knows how to tell when the dog is saying NO!  This is actually a life skill that all kids need to know to keep them and people's pets safe and happy.  Not enough parents teach it!",

It is a living organism with a drive towards self-preservation, it is going to keep escalating it's response until the threat backs off or incapacitates it.",

I know that they meant \"pets\" and not \"animals\", but anyone who actually believes all animals deserve to have some right to not be tormented by humans,  needs to consider that 3 times a day they make a choice whether to contribute to animal suffering or contribute to ending human caused animal suffering.  \n\nSome people are  annoyed by having it pointed out they might not be living up their own ideals, but some become curious and end up seeking new information because they really do care about the impact they have on the world.",

But this isn't one of those scenarios. You took responsibility. You understand your dog's limitations and boundaries. You closed him in your bedroom when you were unable to supervise any interactions, and repeatedly warned a child who was old enough to understand that she was not to go into your bedroom. You did everything right.\n\nUnfortunately, as someone else pointed out, sometimes this is what it takes for kids to learn that animals have boundaries too, and that it's important to respect the warnings and limits given by trusted adults. It sounds like your dog gave more of a warning bite than a full on attack bite, since no skin was broken. Things could have been much worse. Your cousin should count herself lucky she didn't end up physically scarred from ignoring the boundaries you put in place, and should be more careful to respect the boundaries of any animal she comes across in the future. And your family needs to chill and stop blaming you for your cousin's choice to disobey.",

Part of this may be due to their smaller size or breeding that focuses more on cuteness than health/temperament, but I personally think it has a lot to do with how many owners of small dogs think it's cute/funny to tease their dogs. Just look at all the \"demon chihuahua\" videos full of laughing owners and very, very upset dogs for proof. \n\nA dog who is raised with owners that routinely push its boundaries and provoke (and then ignore) its warnings because they think it's \"cute\" is a dog who will quickly learn that warnings don't work, and move on to actual biting. Not saying that's the case with OP (who sounds like a responsible owner). Just something that seems to happen more often with small breeds vs larger ones.",

Which would explain his current dislike of children.\n\nIt does sound like OP has put in a decent amount of work with him though, as they mentioned he's had training, including crate training, which irresponsible owners rarely pursue. Frankly, for a dog with known issues with children, I'm surprised he restrained himself enough to deliver a warning bite to the cousin.

And this is the reason why I strongly believe that *all* interactions between dogs and kids below a certain age/maturity level should be supervised, no matter how well tempered or patient the dog is. \n\nYoung kids are going to push boundaries - both those of the adults around them and those of the animals they see, even if they know better than to do so. And that's a big \"if\" in some homes where parents routinely allow their toddlers to climb all over larger dogs while ignoring all sorts of body language / warning signs indicating the dog is *not* enjoying it. You mentioned that you actually were taught about respecting a dog's space, but you still pushed those boundaries. Because you were four. That's what four year olds do.\n\nEvery dog has its limits. Every single one. I have a service dog. She has an *amazing* temperament and has had to deal with incredibly rude, annoying children (and adults) in public. But she only has to deal with them for a few seconds, because it is *my* responsibility to step in and stop those people from bothering her, which I do. As well trained and tolerant as my dog is, I would never leave her alone in a room with, say, a toddler. If someone were to unexpectedly poke me hard in the eye, or wake me up by jumping on top of me, I might lash out in self defense. I would expect any dog, including mine, to have the potential to do the same. The difference is my dog's only real defense is her teeth, and that could seriously harm, or even kill, a toddler who just doesn't know better. In that nightmare scenario, the blame wouldn't fall on my dog *or* the toddler. It would fall on me.\n\nTl;dr: An ounce of prevention is worth many, many pounds of cure when it comes to dog bites.

Also, I didn't read this as OP believing beforehand their cousin wouldn't listen. They may have assumed an eight year old girl was old enough to listen to their warning to stay out of their room while they were showering, and repeated that warning more than once to be sure. It's just that the cousin didn't listen.\n\nThat said, in general I do agree: prevention is incredibly important when it comes to dog bites. While plenty of kids learn the hard way to respect an animal's boundaries and walk away relatively unharmed, dog bites are a huge cause of plastic surgery in kids as well, and no kid should have to learn a lesson in a way that permanently and severely scars them for life (physically or emotionally). I strongly believe *all* interactions between dogs and kids under a certain age / maturity level should be supervised, even with the best behaved dogs. And if you know your particular dog doesn't handle certain situations / types of people very well, it's always best to try to keep them out of those situations (outside of very specific training scenarios with a qualified trainer overseeing things).\n\nIn this case, it sounds like OP did the best they could with the situation they and their dog were put in. But you do make a good point: had OP lived on their own, it would have been more responsible to not invite a child to stay with them at all.",

Anyone here going on about you not training him well enough, probably doesn't understand that training isn't an end-all-be-all that completely circumvents a dog's capacity for free will. Some dogs are ornery, some have phobias or sensitivities, etc. and training can only address so much.\n\nYou took precautions where you could, supervised their interactions to the best of your ability and repeatedly warned her that your dog wouldn't tolerate her trying to play with him. She deliberately disobeyed this.\n\nBut here's the thing... She's 8. People here seem to overestimate how together a child that age should be. Kids that young may struggle with understanding the consequences of their actions until they happen. If she were 12, then it would be a different story.\n\nBut overall, bullet points of suckage:\n\n* She shouldn't have disobeyed you given multiple warnings. Her getting bitten is her own fault.\n\n* Your grandparents shouldn't be blaming the dog. Did they expect you to lock him in a safe to prevent her from getting bitten?\n\n* Your frustration with your cousin is understandable, but you need to remember that an 8 year old doesn't have the same level of cognitive function and understanding as an adult. She's still learning boundaries, and since it sounds like her parents aren't teaching her very well about them, this could have been turned into a valuable teaching moment.",

Even then if they do bother him he will give multiple warnings before actually biting someone. \n\nMy cousin (8) came over to stay at our (me and grandparents) house for a few days while her parents have a little vacation. I told her multiple times to leave him alone, but while I was in the shower she decide she wanted to go into my room where my dog was (bedroom door was shut) and play with him.\n\n I hear her start crying so I rush out of the shower and see he had bit her. Not hard enough to break skin, but you could see he had bit her. I told her she deserved it because I had told her multiple times to leave him alone. She goes crying to our grandparents, and now they are mad at me because my dog bit her. Even though she invaded his safe space, when she was told to leave him alone.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

                    "comment": "Fwiw, the whole dominance, \"alpha dog\" theory has been repeatedly disproven in dogs (and wolves). The theory itself was developed based on observations made by a man named Rudolph Schenkel, who studied wolves in a zoo that were taken from multiple packs and thrown together. Schenkel observed these wolves in a very unnatural environment and made a lot of inaccurate assumptions and leaps in logic, which led to the whole \"alpha wolf\" theory. Later, a guy named David Mech made this term/theory popular via a book he wrote. Mech has since retracted that theory and admitted it to be inaccurate, as a multitude of studies have now shown. \n\nLong story short, attempting to train a dog by asserting dominance and pretending to be an \"alpha\" leader of a wolf pack not only doesn't work, it can create a lot of problems (as a trainer, I've had to fix them).\n\nAlso, wolf-dog hybrids should never be pets (and really shouldn't exist at all). I've worked with some in my role as trainer, but would never recommend anyone adopt or purchase one. Thankfully, most dogs people label as \"wolf hybrids\" are nothing of the sort, and are instead husky/malamute/etc mixes. True wolf hybrids tend to be very confused animals.\n\nTl;dr: Your friend's hybrid (if it was one) was more tolerant than you know, and you were very lucky to have not been hurt more seriously. And alpha theory, while often practiced by people who genuinely mean well, has been solidly debunked and shown to be harmful/dangerous. It really needs to disappear.",

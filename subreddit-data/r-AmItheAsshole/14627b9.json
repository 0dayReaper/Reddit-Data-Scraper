    "postText": "\nI and my brother are both busy people. I work full time, running my own business \u2014 my brother is a student in a very small seminary. Last year, my grandmother, who was 91, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.\n\nMy grandma was a raging hypochondriac all of her life. If she heard that someone was sick, she suddenly had exactly all of the symptoms they had. You couldn\u2019t be any sicker than her. She was difficult, mean, and downright hateful. Still, my mom bought a house and lived right by her and took care of this terribly thankless woman for nearly FORTY years. Because, as my mom put it, she\u2019s always been sick and \u2018required\u2019 care. \n\n\nMy mom stayed three days in the hospital with her and then nearly two weeks in a nursing home. I visited every day, and my brother came home from school \u2026 because the nursing home discharged her and sent her home. \n\nHere, it was up to us to take care of her. Hospice came every two days, they gave us the morphine and all that we needed to make her comfortable. We were there 24/7, my brother missed a month of school, and who wasn\u2019t there but maybe once or twice a week and also lived ten minutes away? My uncle, my grandmother\u2019s son.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love him. But he didn\u2019t do very much to be of assistance to us during this very traumatic time.\n\nWe sat there, my mom and brother were there when my grandmother took her last breath. But my extended family didn\u2019t come around for the funeral planning \u2014 They griped about the fact that we didn\u2019t have had enough money to buy a headstone immediately ( both of my cousins make significantly more money than I could ever dream of making ) so we bought a headstone, but it was the one my grandma wanted and not the one they wanted.\n\nMy uncle didn\u2019t get much in the will. But we decided to give him the family farm, because he already farms it and we don\u2019t want it. He will make all of the crop earnings, which most of them were going to my grandma, and I told my mom to take what very little my grandma had left in the terms of money. Her house was falling apart, and we got very little from it \u2014 my mom was so traumatized by the ordeal that we moved away, and the little money that is left would be helpful to get my mom cushioned and for her not to have to worry about money. She lives modestly and doesn\u2019t spend very much other than the essentials.\n\n\u2026now here\u2019s the big issue. My uncle wants half of the money. I told my mom to keep all of it, because she got it in the will and I don\u2019t feel that my uncle deserves it. Am I the asshole?",

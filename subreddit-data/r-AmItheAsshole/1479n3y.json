In 2022, she met her current boyfriend, who i was friends with before they properly met. (we all went to the same high-school but she wasn\u2019t friends with some of the people i knew, including him). issues started to rise when they started dating. \n\nWhen he expressed to me that he liked her, i helped him by choosing good options for gifts and planning a surprise for her, giving him advice on what she likes and dislikes. One day, I went to go sleep over at her dorm, and suddenly things changed. He began to hate me for reasons i still don\u2019t know. \n\nAfter that sleep over, she ghosts me for a month. i was confused but decided not to do anything because i always put in effort for conversation and plans, while she didn\u2019t. I just left her alone. \n\nShe comes back and apologizes, telling me that her boyfriend made her ghost me. I gave her a second chance.\n\nAt one point, i decided to post on the note feature on instagram saying \u201cim so hot\u201d. I see that he posted \u201cshort girl really think shes hot\u201d. i told my sister and friends about this, and wr came to the conclusion that he was referring to my note, and we replied saying something in arabic (me and the guy speak arabic) and he decided to dm me saying \u201cmy car went up in height since you stopped riding in it\u201d. basically saying i am fat (i lost like 60 kilos since i first met him but ok) and i left it at that. I decided yo tell my ex bsf about it and she does nothing. \n\nI started telling people out the situation, just getting it off my chest because i felt unheard. since people talk, they told her that i was talking shit about him and their relationship (which i didn\u2019t do) and she cut the friendship off. \n\nnow, back in like April, she contacted me again, saying she was sorry for the way she treated me. this was her second chance to make things right, and i believed she was gonna fix her attitude towards me. we she cane over, she told me that she wanted to hide our friendship from him so he doesn\u2019t get mad at her, which was a huge red flag. she proceeded ti treat me the sane way and ghosted me again, snd she just texted me this morning and told me he found out, and that made them get into an argument. i was being friendly at first but then decided i had enough. i sent her a paragraph telling her about how i felt mistreated and used, walked all over blah blah and that she should stick to her boyfriend and forget about me since i am causing her troubles in her relationship by just existing. she told me that she understands and that she gets that it will be better for it to be like that, which just proves she has no intention of fixing her behaviour.\n\nThe reason i\u2019m wondering if i\u2019m the AH is because i genuinely hate being rude to people. i wanna give her another chance but rver one i know told me i should set my boundaries and stop letting her use me like she did.",

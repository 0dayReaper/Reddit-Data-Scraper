Were you angry because they missed some days of their paying job work or because they weren\u2019t at your house doing the house work? Did you tell them to leave because they did come home sufficiently but didn\u2019t help enough, or because although they did wipe the counter but hadn\u2019t been home enough? And what was the relation between the location of residence versus providing financial support? If your 18 is half as confused as I am, they are probably very confused. I\u2019m okay with parents giving an ultimatum of do X or leave, but it\u2019s very unclear what x is supposed to be.",

If 18 didn\u2019t do chores knowing that it was expected as their \u201crent\u201d and they chose not to do them, then it\u2019s reasonable to evict.  However this situation seems more like you are trying to teach them a lesson /punish them for not doing chores.  I know it seems kinda the same but the second way creates a huge amount of instability for 18 because anything they do that you don\u2019t like could trigger the manipulative \u201cWe will kick you out if you don\u2019t behave how we want\u201d.  \nJust be careful to clearly lay out expectations and consiquences and don\u2019t move the goalposts at a whim and I would say you are ok.",

Each time, we told them that they need to start doing their chores more consistently because once they are an adult and finish school, other things will also become a responsibility (attending their job reliably if they have one, attending classes if they go to college) so by starting to be responsible for their chores gets them more used to having the daily tasks that come with those things. It has also been explained many times that we will never kick them out, they can choose to move but only if they have a place to go. I won't see any of my kids on the street. If it weren't for the fact that BM has been asking 18 to move in with her, the conversation would have gone much differently and there would have been no mention of leaving.",

It sounds like you honestly want the kid to stay there, to the point where you prevented your husband from laying into the kid and forcing the issue to where the kid would leave out of spite. You spoke calmly and clearly explained your and your husband's expectations. You've given the kid a chance to prove they want to be there. That's not unreasonable at 18. It also sets the stage for the 17 year old next year. I assume you are just asking for help in a desperate situation and not just lumping everything on them. It sounds like instead of helping they chose to take a vacation during your time of need. And you even said that's fine, but you aren't going to continue financial support if they aren't even going to help at all. Kids have chores. This kid is refusing to do theirs and I'm guessing the bio-mom isn't helping at all other than giving the kid a place to hide when they don't want to work OR do chores.",

They are an adult - they can help out. Even as much as cooking 1 night a week. My siblings and I were helping with dinner when we were in our teens. This is how you learn life skills. However, if they\u2019ve never done it before then they need help! \n\nBut I would say dad needs to be the one to be setting boundaries and chores too - even if it is a difficult conversation. \n\nYou should both be teaching them that chores are normal. It\u2019s only when you cross over to parentification that you\u2019d be the a-holes. \n\nORIGINAL COMMENT:\n\nI need more information become I can make a judgement. \n\nDoes the 18 yr old also go to school? Or do they work full time? And how much extra house work are they expected to do? Help out here and there or are they looking after the younger kids, cooking and feeding them, cleaning after everyone? You have a 3 yr old and they\u2019re hard work. \n\nNow, if the expectation was they would help with small day to day chores and generally pitching in then I\u2019d say NTA. At 18 they should be helping around the house anyway, same as the 17 yr old. It\u2019s normal for most teenagers to be able to do small chores. I would be pretty pissed off if they left to go to bio mum\u2019s house just to get out of helping. \n\nBasically, did the 18yr old leave because you expected too much?",

We're attempting a popsicle stick method where everyone draws three sticks and those are their chores (3 gets certain ones tailored to them and it's guided) like take out the trash, load the dishwasher, clear the table after dinner.\n\nWe did try doing it by room but decided maybe breaking it down into smaller tasks would work better. So far, it hasn't. I will say that I am not blameless in the lack of chores. I'm just as guilty, more so actually since I'm one of the parents, because I had health issues that caused pain to prevent me from doing a lot. My surgery hopefully corrected that and I can do my part.\n\nI did forget to mention that 17 and 18 both have a day that they're to fix dinner but H does it otherwise and I do breakfast on the weekends.",

It\u2019s like a peak time for the development of mental health issues.

Growing up with a parent \u201ctwo steps above a group home\u201d and also Going through a parents divorce/remarriage can already be hard on a kids sense of security and attachment and then being threatened to be kicked out of your home is just another blow to that. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like 18 is used to chores. You can talk to them about expectations, why they are important  and consequences without it being about kicking them out. And also talk to them about their barriers to meeting the expectations. (Eg if chores feel tedious they can be done while listening to music, podcasts, talking on the phone). If the kid is given a manageable amount of chores to start with (eg if they\u2019re not used to doing any chores, asking them to do an entire list of things because you\u2019re having surgery may feel too overwhelming) and they\u2019re missing their job to hide with BM jus to get out of the housework, it sounds like they need some counselling or something else is going on.",

Also, while it doesn\u2019t sound like 18 has objectively excessive demands placed on them at all so I have no idea if this is the case, but it is really common for oldest children of larger families to have to take on an unfair amount of responsibility with things such as childcare or even just child supervision/guidance when the parents are home. \n\nOf course I have no idea, the kid could just not gaf Or there could be a host of other things going on. But since they otherwise seem to have a good relationship with OP, they agreed to do the chores and then last minute ran away, and they have a bio mom who sounds like they have significant issues, it all makes me wonder if the kid has undiagnosed neurodivergence  or mental health struggles of some kind. \n\nBut either way, threatening eviction isn\u2019t fair or likely helpful for anything other than short term compliance out of fear, and even that would come at significant cost.",

I agree with the other posters who are confused about exactly what the 18 yr old was meant to have been doing and when, which means the 18 yr old could have been just as confused. \n\nI also cannot understand why the response to your teenager being a pretty typical teenager was to... kick them out? Because although you said you weren't evicting them, *you were totally evicting them.* You can try to \"technically\" and \"well actually\" through it, but that kid now knows that although you say you love and support \"all\" the kids, you're also completely ok with kicking them out. The mixed signals here are ridiculous.\n\nYou're also TA for the crappy comment about the bio mum and the group home. Not only is it shitty, it was completely irrelevant to the post. If you were legitimately concerned, you wouldn't have let the 18 yr go there for a week, or have visits there. But you clearly do. It comes across as a snarky stab, just because you can. That's pretty gross.\n\nAnd you're right, H should have handled it. And if it devolved into a fight and the 18yr old left? *Well you were kicking them out anyway, so what difference is that going to make.*\n\nStart earlier with the other kids. The rule here is \"you live here, you help to the best of your capabilities.\" We're gentle parents (you mention trying to do things gently), my kids are teens and a young adult, and gentle parenting doesn't mean you don't have come-to-jesus talks about expectations, team work and respect. But it DOES mean you find ways to communicate and meet everyone's needs without threats or kicking out your kids. You can hold the 18yr old accountable for not keeping their word, and for not helping out when it was needed, but if you yeet them out of the house, you can't do anything.",

Either 18 is an adult who financially contributes to the household, but their personal life (seeing BM, hours worked, etc) are none of your business, or they are a child with a chore chart, approved visitors and a curfew. You can\u2019t ask for both. \n\nI understand that you\u2019ve just had a surgery, and I truly hope that it does fix your health. But you should not be asking your children to pick up the slack left by your absence, simply because they live under your roof. Providing a home is your responsibility as a mother, and picking up the slack is your husband\u2019s responsibility as a father. Moreover, I highly doubt that the \u2018slack\u2019 is basic chores; I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re expecting help with cooking, driving, laundry and grocery shopping, as well as entertaining, wrangling and caring for the younger kids. That\u2019s a huge amount of work, especially for two teenagers. I would have balked too. \n\nAt the end of the day, I understand that you\u2019re under a lot of stress, but your reaction here was extreme and retaliatory. You didn\u2019t like 18s behaviour, or, by the sound of it, that they were spending time with BM, and instead of having a calm discussion about expectations and potential future consequences, you went nuclear. You might not have yelled, but \u2018if you go see your BM instead of staying here and doing chores that I can\u2019t do, you can take your things and go\u2019 is absolutely, unconditionally, the nuclear option. \n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if 18 does take BM up on her offer. Her household may not be as nice as yours, but I\u2019m guessing it comes with a lot less expectations and rules.",

You\u2019re a two parent family so that falls to your partner too. You have children between you.\n\nYou can have expectations of reasonable chores etc of older teens and young adult children in your house that relate to privileges they get or not,  but the 18 yo has  just finished their exams and are probably really shattered. They\u2019re going to college in the fall so it\u2019s hardly like they are a \u201cwaster\u201d. I appreciate you said they\u2019ve let their work down but it sounds like a PT job (that may not be giving them any time off after exams) and they may not have seen BM for a while, having spent months studying hard. They do need a mental break. \n\nIf you &amp; partner choose this as a hill to die in (or take a stand), I  think you\u2019ll regret it. It\u2019s never a good idea to even subtly threaten one of your children newly 18 with being thrown out, which is essentially what you\u2019re doing even if they have BM to live with- you have indicated BM\u2019s  situation isn\u2019t maybe stable \n\nTry to negotiate if you can and appreciate maybe they needed a little break. Let that week they went away for  pass and say now you\u2019re back please can you help out we really appreciate it as we\u2019re a team.\n\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable  to expect them to clean up after themselves &amp; to join in shared chores but they need to be taught and encouraged, taking a dictatorial stand or sudden excessive consequences if they don\u2019t now they\u2019re 18, won\u2019t get the results you want.",

During this week, 18 missed several days of work for various reasons then messaged me saying they were going back to BM's after the one day they did go to work.\n\nH and I talked then I told 18 that should they do that, they were to come to the house first, gather their clothing, and leave their phone (on our plan) and everything else as they are showing they are wishing to not be part of this household due to willfully neglecting their responsibilities. I explained that we are not evicting them, merely outlining what is expected and what their other option was at that time. Yes, I know it should have been H's responsibility to have this conversation, but they don't always see eye to eye and it may have led to a fight where 18 did leave.\n\nThey came home that night then cleaned one counter the following day after being asked to help with the kitchen. As expected, there was a lot of attitude and grumbling. I explained that we don't WANT them to leave. We love them and want them to have a stable home until they're ready to go. We have tried to guide them gently and easily but that hasn't proven to work so it's time for tough love. H and I told them that even if they choose to leave, they will have our support in everything they do, just not financially.\n\nWhile we have good jobs for our area, we cannot afford to keep paying for an adult who doesn't wish to participate in the household. Unfortunately, the extreme lack of reliability to do chores by myself (health issues that surgery hopefully corrected) and the oldest two (refusal to help except for random bouts of generosity on their parts) has taught the younger ones that they don't need to help either. We're working on getting everyone on track. H has been the one to pick up all the slack and it's wearing him down.\n\nI do want to say that 18 and I usually get along wonderfully. 18 has told me on multiple occasions that BM wants them to move in with them so if they left here, they do technically have somewhere to go. We're just leary because BM is basically two steps above needing to live in a group home setting.\n\nI just don't know if I did the right thing by laying out clear expectations for them to stay or if I should have just let them continue on as they have been and keep silent.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Family members having health issues can be traumatic on children (18 is still a child even if the law disagrees) and there are already lots of changes going on in an 18 year Olds life even when they don't have to take over part of what a patent was doing. Part of me is torn because if the surgery was necessary (like time sensitive and urgent not like an elective surgery you could have now or whenever) then stepping up would be good but then a parent you care about having an emergency surgery is hard to deal with.",

I can't look into his brain but here's some possible things that could be going on.  \n1: He might struggle with executive dysfunction. some people struggle with tasks they have to do. It might be because they cant handle stress very well, their brain isnt cooperating, or they have trouble breaking tasks down into manageable pieces and get overwhelmed  \n2: He might suffer from mental health issues: there are lots of conditions that just drain you of all your mental energy and make it tough to keep up with necessary tasks.  \n3: He might be having a rough time and just coping very badly with it. people are weird animals, and sometimes they respond to tough situations in shitty ways. Reexamining your behaviours and healthy coping mechanisms are things that need to be learned.  \n\n\nAnyways, if you DO kick your son out, He is probably not gonna fair well. If he struggles going to work consistently, he is not ready to be self-sufficient. He might actually face homelessness. when its sink or swim, many people do sink, and you need to be aware of that.  \n\n\nTough love does not work for a lot of people, it makes things worse in some cases.  \nEither way you cut it, your son needs help. Sit down with him, approach him with love and kindness, but stay firm that things do need to change. work together with him and find the root of the problem, and what steps you can take to make things better. I promise both of you will be happier if you can work together on this.  \n\n\nI got kicked out in a very similar way in my early 20s. I had a boatload of unaddressed mental health issues, both 1 and 2, which could have been adressed. But unfortunately neither me or my parents were able to admit i had actual problems, and so i got kicked out, became homeless twice, and suffered several mental breakdowns so bad, it left me legally severely disabled. Been in recovery for 2 years and i am very slowly clawing my way back to functioning with little progress.",

BM was going to be picking them up from work instead of H if they chose to go down there that night. As for the phone, they have a phone that BM gave them shortly after we got them the one we did. I don't know why BM did such, but it's between 18 and BM.\n3. H asked me to be the one to send the message because he feels I can word things more tactfully, which I honestly struggle to do at times.\n4. Not upset about the attitude, just included that info because I felt it was important. Maybe it is to some but not others.\n5. We can't financially support someone not living in our home right now. Maybe in the future, but not currently. BM has her own finances. She just doesn't manage them on her own. If 18 were to move in there, they would still get support.\n6. 18 years old is an adult, no matter who it is. I'm speaking legally. I will do no different with my other children. This isn't a \"Well, they're not mine biologically, so I want them out.\" like some are assuming. The only difference in treatment is older to younger as the younger ones need a bit more help doing some things than the older ones.\n7. I have done what I can in the past, but I don't feel it's enough. My health has impacted what I was able to do. Therefore, I had surgery that hopefully corrected it. Spinal surgery specifically so that I can stand and walk without being in pain all the time.\n8. We didn't leave anything up to the older ones. Just asked that they strive to be good human beings that others can look up to. I try to be a good person, but I know I make mistakes, and so do they. I'm trying to teach them to learn from them. Unfortunately, doing it the nice way hasn't been working, so we attempted some tough love.\n9. It wasn't just him, the younger ones, and myself. It was the older ones as well. He was literally doing everything on top of working 6 days a week. We asked 18 and 17 to at least pick up after themselves so he didn't have to. 18 didn't. Actually filled the sink with dishes that I don't even know where they came from. We asked them to clean it up, and they disappeared to BM's instead, so H ended up doing them anyway. 17 was given the warning of that behavior is unacceptable and will no longer be tolerated. They immediately started doing their chores and have done them every day since. It has helped take a lot of pressure off H.\n\nI hope I didn't miss any questions.",

They only came back after that ultimatum, thinking if they did the bare minimum of chores, you\u2019d back off. \n\nThis attitude is not going to serve them well in life. No employer will tolerate their no-calls/no-shows. I\u2019ve known kids just like 18 and picking up after them has always been a pain. So much back talk. No amount of coaching has gotten anywhere with them; they just do the bare minimum and hide somewhere in the store. They\u2019re often let go after three consecutive NCNS.\n\nI hope you\u2019re healing well from your surgery! Sorry you\u2019re dealing with all of this.",

I was raised with the understanding I was part of a family and me doing my chores was important to the functioning of the family unit. I realize this may not be modern day teaching and some kids aren't given chores. Your 18 yo almost needing to be in a group home is telling, especially when the 17 yo is doing their part to help. Living with bio-mom might actually be a good, positive experience for him in his life journey, giving him an opportunity to live and function in another environment. He went there by his own choice and his BM seems open to it. Definitely let him take his belongings and let his mom get him a phone. If his mom was paying you child support, she no longer has to pay it. Myself, instead of having him leave with my anger or disappointment considering his different abilities, I'd have him leave with love but not pay for his upkeep, etc. Mom can handle that or he may be ready to seek employment up to his level of functioning.",

Let them each pick one, then another one, etc. \n\nMake it clear that the chores will rotate at times, and won't always be their preferred ones, even if you'll do your best. Dishes are probably the most problematic and unless someone loves doing them, this has to be everyone's resp in turn).\n\nMake it everyone's responsibility -- if everything gets done, you can all go on a picnic or something. Not a big deal. Cleaning your room isn't Disneyland material.

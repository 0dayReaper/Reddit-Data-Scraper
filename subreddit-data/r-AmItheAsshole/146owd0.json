Your mum needs to grow up and stop throwing a tantrum like a child. It's not like you're disappearing forever; you're just spending a couple of days with your boyfriend and his family. Your mum needs to learn to let go and trust that you're capable of making your own decisions. Happy birthday in advance, hope you have a great time!",

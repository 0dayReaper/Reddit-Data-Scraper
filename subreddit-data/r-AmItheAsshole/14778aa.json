The action I took was trying to look out for my girlfriend's well being by setting her up for an employment meeting where she can build basic job skills that she hasn't had for a few years now, due to her being on disability for quite some time. If we want to move in together, I cannot be the only breadwinner in the house.\n\n2. I might be the asshole because she gets mad at me when I try to help better her current situation. It seems as though whatever I do, I almost always get in trouble for it\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She's 26, I'm 22. We don't live together, neither of us drive (though I have my learners), and I'm the only one in the relationship that has active employment; she's on ODSP/welfare (this is important for later). \n\nLong story short, e've been arguing about certain things, like important appointments, in order to help her get on the track she wants to be on in life going forward, and it's really bothering me mentally. For example, I had to set up a few dentist appointments for her over the last few months, and we had to keep pushing back her latest because every time she has spent the night at my place, I'd have to call them in order to cancel because she would get a migraine apparently; it just seems a tad too convienient to me, though I currently don't have any current reason to think that she was faking it. \n\nMore recently, I had a job opportunity come across my inbox not too long ago for a public service position in my hometown, which is an hours car ride away from the city where my girlfriend and I currently live. I talked to her about it, and basically summed it up as if she want's to come live with me in my hometown should I be accepted in this new position, she would need to start looking for employment as well since she can't be on welfare all her life. She agreed that she would start looking, and I set her up for an appointment through the same employment agency that I have used in the past year almost, and have current contact with. The problems arise however, because I booked this appointment for her 2 weeks ago almost now, and as of today, it would be the second time pushing it back due to her having to rearrange her room for her landlord, or she'll \"be homeless\" as she's told me. When I asked her about it and reminded her about the appointment, she got angry at me for it and told me I wasn't listening when she says she will be busy all this week with other shit.\n\nI have told her time and time again that these appointments can't keep being pushed back the way they are, and they have to be done, but she just gets angry at me and it makes me feel like utter garbage for even mentioning it. \n\nThis is where I turn to you guys - like I said at the top of this post, I don't know where to go from here, though I would not be surprised if I end up being the asshole in this situation.  \n\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "postText": "Long time lurker, first time poster. So earlier tonight I (36F) went with my wife (32F) over to my in-laws house to hang out. We frequently do this, we all let our puppies hang out and make food and have some drinks. Well I\u2019m an apocalypse\u2026not enthusiast necessarily\u2026but I think it\u2019s gonna happen. And we were all taking quizzes about how long we\u2019d last in the zombie apocalypse. Anyhoo one of the questions was \u201ccould you carry a family member on your back\u201d. Here is where things went wrong. My wife wanted me to heft myself onto her back while her sister carried their mom on her back. But I\u2019ve gained some weight, and I know my wife always talks about her back pain, so I didn\u2019t want to jump on her back so I wouldn\u2019t hurt her. Also I didn\u2019t want to embarrass myself as, like I said, I have gained some weight recently. She insists. I hoist myself onto her back, and she takes off. Her sister is running alongside with their mom on her back. I knew it was going to happen before it did. I saw us start to go down, my wife lost her footing, we were crashing, I landed in part grass..part sharp metal fence. Scraped my hand and got an an abrasion on my leg, but I\u2019m okay. My wife is totally fine, but now upset with me that I didn\u2019t ask her about how her back was and if she was okay. In my mind, I didn\u2019t want to get on her back to begin with. I verbalized this multiple times. She is the one who insisted, the one who crashed, and I was the one who landed half in grass and half on a broken fence\u2026her family was all asking me if I was okay. AITA for not asking about her back?",

Are you up to date on your tetanus shot? Sounds like you could have been gravely injured and had to ensure your own survival first and foremost. You seemed to have made it clear that you didn\u2019t think it was a good idea and that should have been respected. You tried your best to prevent this whole scenario from occurring as you knew the outcome would be poor and didn\u2019t want to cause or exacerbate any of your wife\u2019s back problems. Hopefully when the zombie apocalypse happens you figure out a better solution to get around. Overall, NTA but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to check on her \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Although many people think you get tetanus from stepping on a rusty nail, any wound that opens the skin can cause tetanus. Your provider may recommend a tetanus booster shot if you have a cut and you either:\n-Don\u2019t know your immunization history (it\u2019s safe to get an additional shot early if needed).\n-Got your last tetanus dose more than 10 years before the wound.\n-Have had fewer than three doses of the tetanus shot.\"",

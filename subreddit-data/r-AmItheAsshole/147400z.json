    "postText": "I (18NB) have a mother (51F) who I love very much, but something I and my dad (56M) have a serious issue with is her dictating what or how we watch or listen to media as a family. There are moments where my mom promises to put on something my dad wants to watch but then watches something else instead and also her trying to force me to watch some videos of Bruce Springsteen concert moments that I don\u2019t want to watch. And we almost NEVER get to watch anything I want to watch whatsoever and it makes me feel left out.\n\nMy aunt (53F) is visiting from across the ocean and we haven\u2019t physically seen her in years other than facetime and whatnot. I really wanted to spend time with her. Yesterday though, my mom tried to shove The Last of Us down her throat by texting me to \u201csuggest\u201d the show. Now it\u2019s a good show, but I\u2019m not going to force my aunt to do anything she doesn\u2019t want to do. And she doesn\u2019t. I did \u201csuggest\u201d but I was irritated and today my mom and aunt got in a row because my aunt won\u2019t watch the show. Meanwhile I texted my aunt about what my mom tried to do and how I don\u2019t actually want to watch it right now. She actually told me she\u2019s interested in watching some of my stuff, which is history. That really touched me because my mom always seems to blow off history videos I find because it\u2019s not \u201cgraphically appealing\u201d or makes some stupid excuse up about how a person is acting or doing something. Well later my aunt and mom got in another row and I think my mom started getting suspicious that I went around her back because she\u2019s been giving me some looks\u2026\n\nI love my mom, but my dad and I have had constant problems with this. And I\u2019ve had issues with her not being more willing to sit down and watch something I actually want to watch for once. I\u2019m just sick of it. But at the same time, I feel like an asshole for going behind her back.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: We did talk to and engage with each other for the majority of the day, so we weren\u2019t ignoring each other, we were bonding. Today was a Sunday in fact and we live in a place where everything is closed on Sundays. Also my mom tried to bring up the tv stuff and I wasn\u2019t into watching tv at that time, neither my aunt or dad. I was just sick of my mom trying to dictate everything and pissed that I lied to my aunt so I went and told her the truth and said how frustrating it was and she sympathised.",

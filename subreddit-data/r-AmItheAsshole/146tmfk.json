Proportionate splitting is often best for serious long term relationships, but 50/50 can still be fair as long as you continue to live within her means. If doesn\u2019t feel like she can\u2019t contribute less without feeling bad there is no point trying to logic her out of her mindset.\n\n\nI do think you should have more long term conversations tho. You say wife in the title but girlfriend in the post, what is it actually? If you aren\u2019t married, would getting married make her feel more secure? Would she be ok with still splitting bills 50/50, but you pay entirely for dates/vacations? If you saved it for a downpayment for a house would she feel comfortable joining you on the deed and mortgage or would she push to wait until she could contribute equally?\n\n\nThere may be solutions you haven\u2019t thought of, and talking more about why she feels this way without trying to convince her of your way might help.",

We've been together for three years and have been living together for the past year.  \nSince we moved in together, we've been splitting all of our expenses--rent, utilities, groceries, etc.--50/50. However, recently I got a significant promotion at work and am now making nearly double what I was before.  \nI told my girlfriend that I wanted to start contributing more to our shared expenses, since I'm now making more money. I suggested that we start splitting our expenses proportionate to our incomes, so that I pay a higher percentage than she does.  \nHowever, my girlfriend wasn't happy with this idea. She said that it wasn't fair for me to pay less than her for anything, even if I'm making more money. She also said that it would make her feel bad if I paid for more things because it would make her feel like she wasn't contributing equally.  \nI tried to explain to her that it's common for couples to split expenses proportionately to their incomes, and that it's a fairer way to do it. I also told her that I didn't want her to feel bad and that I valued her contributions to our household.  \nHowever, she wouldn't budge on her position and accused me of being selfish and trying to control her. She said that I was trying to flex my financial muscles and make her feel inferior.  \nNow, we're not speaking to each other. I feel like I'm in an impossible position--either I pay more than her and make her feel bad, or we split things 50/50 and I'm not contributing my fair share. Am I the asshole for suggesting that we split expenses proportionate to our incomes?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

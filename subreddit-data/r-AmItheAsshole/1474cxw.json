In what world does nearly a month's notice not give them enough time to re-book your slot? This is a cleaning service you booked, not an appearance before the queen. \n\nAdd to that the fact that she would not communicate with you properly. If she wants you to re-book under her terms, she needs to communicate those terms to you, and in a timely manner. She expects you to, what? give her more than a month's notice? not re-schedule? But she cannot be bothered to participate in basic communication to arrange an outcome that suits her. \n\nImo, the ghosting and attitude are intended to intimidate you into giving in...either to have her come on the original schedule or, more likely, to cancel and walk away from your deposit.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nOk so back story: my husband and I both work full time and have no kids and as a result are blessed to have a regular cleaner who cleans my house every other week- she is amazing and affordable but very busy schedule and can\u2019t do more than her usual services. \n\nWell I was looking for a deep spring clean and asked for reccos on a local women\u2019s Fb group and found a woman who allegedly does a great job, got a quote from her and booked her for a big deep clean 2 months from the time we spoke. \n\nWell right after booking I got pregnant which was a huge shock after 3.5 years of infertility and multiple failed treatments. I was one of the lucky ladies with severe morning sickness and was basically bed ridden and my house was an absolute wreck while trying to still work full time and survive. About 3.5 weeks prior to the deep cleaning we booked I realized it really wasn\u2019t a good time because we needed to declutter before a deep clean and I was not physically up to it and my husband works a very demanding job and was busy picking up my slack. I immediately texted the cleaner to see if it was possible to push the cleaning out a couple months ( I said I was willing to go as far out as November- this was back in March) and she said would get back to me and see. I said it was no problem if she couldn\u2019t but to let me know. I really didn\u2019t think this would be an issue with giving her 9 months to work with rescheduling. Well she never got back to me. I honestly forgot about it with being extremely sick and followed up about a week before the scheduled cleaning to see if she was able to move it as our house was still a wreck and really not in a place for a deep cleaning. She didn\u2019t respond for 3 more days so I sent another text (this point 2 days before the originally scheduled cleaning) and she said she really needs to stick to the original plan which I was willing to do originally but with her basically ghosting me this whole time we didn\u2019t even get the bare minimum done and it reallyyyy wasn\u2019t a good time. I basically told her she\u2019s welcome to come look at the house but I\u2019d really rather push it back even if that means wayyy back to like November. \n\nShe never responded and this was almost 2 months ago. She did take a deposit during original booking so I followed up with her today and she\u2019s acting annoyed, telling me she has a cancellation policy (that I was never made aware of) but she will \u201cwaive the fee\u201d and said she was waiting for me to reach out about scheduling even though I was the last person to send her a text and have told her multiple times the time frame that works for us. Idk I do see some gray area here because I was originally willing to keep our first date I just don\u2019t see why she couldn\u2019t reschedule with 3+ weeks notice and why she couldn\u2019t communicate better and don\u2019t feel like this is my fault but I can definitely tell she thinks it is. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The point was that a top brain surgeon is uniquely qualified and in demand. And if this particular service is as in demand as that, then they should have no trouble at all filling the slot she gave 3.5 weeks notice to re-schedule. \n\n\"It's annoying.\" What's your point? Are you suggesting the cleaning service has no obligation to work with her to re-schedule because they are annoyed? They have no obligation to communicate with her because they are...annoyed?

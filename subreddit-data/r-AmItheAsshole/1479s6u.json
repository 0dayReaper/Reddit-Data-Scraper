    "postText": "Hello everyone! My roommate (I'll call her Alex) and I are not particularly fond of each other.\n\nHere's the backstory: Her and I met last year when she was still living with her ex's mother. I was already renting a room in a home and my landlord was looking for someone to rent the room across from mine because the old tenant had moved out. Although I only knew Alex for about a month, I thought I would be a nice person and ask her if she wanted to move in. I know now this is where I made a mistake by asking a person I honestly barely knew to move in but it is what it is. \n\nFast forward, before she moves in, we end up \"breaking up\" as friends so I go to the landlord and try to explain to her what happened as to prevent Alex from actually moving in. The reason why we weren't friends anymore is because she was a rude and distant person to me and judged me for almost everything I did. She even called me a loser for vaping which I know isn't exactly a cool thing to do anyways but to each their own. \n\nAnyways, my landlord decides to let her move in. I say ok, that's fine, maybe we could possibly reconcile and live harmoniously but my problem now is that she won't help clean the bathroom we have to share. We've already had a discussion with the landlord because Alex had the nerve to demand me thru text to clean the toilet out of nowhere and I called her out and asked why she couldn't do it if it bothered her so much. I provided evidence of when she dirtied up the bathroom mirror with something and I ended up cleaning it without saying anything about it. \n\nEventually, the landlord ruled that we have a schedule for who cleans the bathroom. Alex chose to clean it after that discussion then never again. Mind you, we had this talk in March. Since then, I've been the one to clean it and I'm honestly fed up with the disrespect from Alex. She has left hair from the drain on the side of the tub and the tub shroom I bought for the both of us continues to be taken out by her and she doesn't bother to clean it. I've texted her to ask politely if she could clean the tub shroom if she leaves it out but she still leaves it out for me to clean. \n\nI'm starting to feel like a maid instead of a roommate and I just want to know if I'm in the wrong for having these expectations. Also, I'm the one routinely restocking the bathroom. She has never bought not even toilet paper for us. I'd also like to ask her to help out in that aspect or to split the amount paid with me. I don't mind getting the stuff since she doesn't have a car but if I'm going to be putting in the money and she's just using it without paying me back for it I'd rather take everything out of the bathroom like the tp and soap and bring it with me when I use it.",

I helped get her this place and am unsure if I have any right to even ask her to help clean the bathroom. \n\n2) This might make me the asshole because in my opinion we should be cleaning up after ourselves and helping keep our shared space clean.

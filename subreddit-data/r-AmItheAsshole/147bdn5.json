Most teenagers want nothing to do with their parents. He just doesn't give a shit. Move out at 18, get some counselling, and move on with your life. Your worth is not tied to your father. I had to learn that lesson, too.",

I have 10 siblings and as you\u2019ve probably guessed most of us have different mothers. My dad goes to work at 6 am and comes home at 12:15 am. He NEVER takes days off, so starting from age 9 I\u2019d ask my dad to take the day off of work to hang out with me. Moving onto my step-mom, she and my dad got married two days before my birthday. However, since both of them are workaholics (two full time jobs + overtime each) they don\u2019t usually spend their anniversaries together. My step-mom isn\u2019t my favorite person, she\u2019s more like that one girl that talks sh!t about behind your back. I can get over that though. She just doesn\u2019t like me and my siblings. However, on my 14th birthday my dad spent the day with my brother (they were working I believe). But I got over that pretty quickly because I got to spend like 2 hours with him. We watched a movie and it was pretty fun. Next year during March my dad had to get 3 surgeries done on his thumb because the liquid in his joints started leaking out. He was out of work for around a month, but he had a lot of days off available. I asked my dad to take my birthday off of work in November, January, April, and May. To this he said \u201cdon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take the day off and hang out with you!\u201d. I considered that my dad may not be able to hang out with me on my birthday. In fact, I would\u2019ve been fine even if he hung out with me 20 days late. However, my dad called me at around 7 pm and said \u201cI can\u2019t hang out with you at all, and I can\u2019t come to your awards ceremony either. I\u2019m going to spend the day with step-mom\u201d. I cried upon hearing this, and he told me that she had taken the day off for him, so he had to return the favor. I didn\u2019t even expect him to come to the awards ceremony, he never had before. But even then, my dad has more days off. \n\nToday he hung out with my step-mom, older sister, me, and younger brother (this was her birthday gift to me). While we were eating he decided to pull me aside and said \u201cstop acting so emotional! Are you close to your period or are you just letting your best friend\u2019s move dictate your life! Your step-mom is paying for you to eat, stop being ungrateful. I don\u2019t care if you have to act like your happy, ACT!\u201d. I was hurt by this, and was holding back my tears. I didn\u2019t try to look sad/angry, and I had been saying thank you all night. The siblings I\u2019ve told this to have agreed that he\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nI feel as though I may be TA because his thumb is still recovering, and I\u2019m basically complaining that he\u2019s missing my birthday when I don\u2019t usually have a birthday. I also think I\u2019m just using this as an excuse to blame my accumulated sadness onto something. \n\nSo, was I TA for being sad that my dad won\u2019t hang out with me on my birthday?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "postText": "So my(29f) bf(34m) have been together for a little over a year. I own my own little home (edit: I rent the land )but I have a job in the next town over which is an hour away, a few months after my bf and I got together he wanted me to move in with him to save on travel costs because he lives in the town I work. \n\nMy plan is to eventually move my house as it is mobile to the town i work however zoning laws are terrible (and predatory if you do your research tbh) and I have not been able to find land to buy and put it on. The plan was for both of us to live in my home to save money. \n\nTo start I pay half the bills for my boyfriends house plus my own bills for my house. He does not pay for any bills for my house. I also usually pay for a lot of outings as I make more money than he does. \n\nI go to my house once a week to visit take care of things do some improvements but I couldn't today because I was sick in bed. My boyfriend was wonderful enough to offer to go to take care of my lawn today. He brought his dog who is a large dog to note. \n\nI gave him a call to check in and see how everything was and he noted the landlord came by and saw him and the dog asked if he lived here and he said YES. The landlord asked if I sold the house and he said \"No but yes I live here.\"\n\nI was so upset I immediately hung up because I wanted time to process my anger before I immediately went off on him for saying that a dog and human who werent on the lease lived at my house. \n\nI tried calling back to explain better why I was angry but he didn't pick up and isn't answering texts.\n\nI imagine there's gonna be anger when he gets  home from both sides and I don't even know what to do about the situation. Is it a big deal and did I overreact? Aita?\n\nTldr: bf and dog went to my house to do chores while I was sick and told my landlord they lived there with me I hung up on him when he told me.",

Why do you get to live with him but he doesn't live with you? Why is hanging up better than whatever communication could have occurred, do you not trust yourself to handle things rationally or at least tell him you'll have to call him back?",

His girlfriend lives alone (for the most part) so he probably went into protective mode when a strange man asked if he lived there. I am sure this could be explained to the landlord if any issues were to arise from their interaction.",

I own my own little home but I have a job in the next town over which is an hour away, a few months after my bf and I got together he wanted me to move in with him to save on travel costs because he lives in the town I work. \n\nMy plan is to eventually move my house as it is mobile to the town i work however zoning laws are terrible (and predatory if you do your research tbh) and I have not been able to find land to buy and put it on. The plan was for both of us to live in my home to save money. \n\nTo start I pay half the bills for my boyfriends house plus my own bills for my house. He does not pay for any bills for my house. I also usually pay for a lot of outings as I make more money than he does. \n\nI go to my house once a week to visit take care of things do some improvements but I couldn't today because I was sick in bed. My boyfriend was wonderful enough to offer to go to take care of my lawn today. He brought his dog who is a large dog to note. \n\nI gave him a call to check in and see how everything was and he noted the landlord came by and saw him and the dog asked if he lived here and he said YES. The landlord asked if I sold the house and he said \"No but yes I live here.\"\n\nI was so upset I immediately hung up because I wanted time to process my anger before I immediately went off on him for saying that a dog and human who werent on the lease lived at my house. \n\nI tried calling back to explain better why I was angry but he didn't pick up and isn't answering texts.\n\nI imagine there's gonna be anger when he gets  home from both sides and I don't even know what to do about the situation. Is it a big deal and did I overreact? Aita?\n\nTldr: bf and dog went to my house to do chores while I was sick and told my landlord they lived there with me I hung up on him when he told me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

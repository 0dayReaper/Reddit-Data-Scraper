I can understand originally planning that way because it makes it more affordable but the remaining 8 people will probably be very grateful that their mornings aren't being shared with 2 additional people.",

Just be polite and ask what time they would like you to join them each morning. Good luck.",

There\u2019s no reason to make your vacation miserable! \nI have a big family and we used to all cram into my grandparents house. 10-15+ people and ONE BATHROOM. I strongly advise that you get a hotel room or you\u2019re going to regret this trip big time.",

However, your bf is correct that his mother will be offended because she invited you on a family trip and you are choosing not to stay with the family. Since he doesn\u2019t have a problem with the accommodations at the house, you should encourage him to still stay with his family even though you\u2019ll be at the hotel. That should help ease his mother\u2019s frustration about this.",

You don\u2019t know his entire family and kind of need a private place to recharge your batteries for a trip that long, but again you agreed to a family trip so I\u2019d tread lightly on how hard you try to push the issue.",

My bf and I can only stay for two weeks while everyone else will be there for three weeks. There\u2019s going to be a total of 10 people going.\n\nHis mom has a very type A personality and has already written up an itinerary of what we\u2019ll be doing day to day, which involves visiting a lot of my bf\u2019s extended family members who still live there, which i don\u2019t mind but i also want to explore other things.\n\nHis mom expects us to stay at their house during that trip. According to my bf, the house isn\u2019t in the best shape, and it only has 3 bedrooms and two bathrooms. I asked him if everyone who is going on the trip will be staying there and he said yes. His mom already ordered some air mattresses.\n\nI told my bf that I don\u2019t feel comfortable staying at a house with that many people. His sister and brother in law have two kids so of course they get one room, his parents get the other room, and i don\u2019t want to take the other room away from his aunt and uncle.\n\nI\u2019ve expressed wanting to stay at a hotel close by, but my bf says he\u2019ll feel bad and his mom will be upset if we don\u2019t stay there. He said that he feels like we\u2019ll be disrespecting his family. I said that  maybe i can tough it out one night but for two weeks? No way.\n\nAm I being unreasonable?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

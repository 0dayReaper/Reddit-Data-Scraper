    "postText": "I live in a small complex where there\u2019s a driveway in the back for the garages. There are two entrances/exits. Sometimes when I come out of my garage I\u2019ll turn right to leave and a GIANT truck will be parked in the driveway exit. It\u2019s impossible to make the turn. I know because I tried to do it once and I dented the fuck out of my car. So now when it\u2019s parked there, I have to reverse all the way to the other exit. Yes, I could do that and no one would be bothered but I pay a lot of money to live in this complex and it feels extremely entitled on their part to render that whole exit useless. I tried talking to them about it already but it didn\u2019t help. Would I be the asshole if I called towing on them?\n\nEdit: in our complex we don\u2019t tell the property managers but we park in front of our garages so we get an extra space. This lead to one person parking on their unit wall in the driveway. You can still drive through it though. And THIS lead to someone parking a giant truck in the other driveway but this time you can\u2019t make the turn. If I blow the whistle , we all lose our extra space \n\nTdlr: my neighbor blocks a whole exit/entrance in my complex and I could use the other since there are two exits but I want to call towing on him",

More than likely for the number of housing units it\u2019s required to have a secondary exit in case of emergency or fire. So that would be another good thing to look into. Because very few builders will put in a secondary entrance/exit when they could make money with another unit. \nTowing might look petty. But going through other route you\u2019re looking out for the safety and well being of everyone in the complex.\n\nEta. NTA",

If it's on public land, call the police. If it's a privately owned property that ISN\"T your own property (like your situation), the owners/property management would have to do it. You have no standing to do it (except in cases like the one in my neighborhood. The HOA has contracted with a local towing company so if a car violates the HOA parking regs, anyone can call the tow company and complain. They also know the regs and will check and tow if appropriate.)",

            "comment": "NTA.  This reminds me of the apartment I used to live in.   Large city.  On one of the main city streets, multi-lane, heavy fast traffic, no shoulder or pull-over area.  If you stepped 30cm off the sidewalk, you were in a traffic lane with FAST traffic.  On our side of the road, the road was one way.  The apartment had off-street parking blocked by an electronic gate.  If you had the transmitter in your car, you could drive through.  The electronic gate was between two buildings with just enough room for one car to pass through.  That gate and the narrow road it was on...they were the only way in and out of the parking lot for the apartment building.  \n\nOne night I was driving home from work about 5PM.  Traffic was heavy.  As usual, I had to take a long detour to get to my road headed the proper direction on my side of the street (one way, so I had to go way PAST my building and do a U-turn to get back to it.)\n\nAs I'm getting ready to turn into the gate, there is a car PARKED IN FRONT OF THE GATE.  If I keep driving straight, I will have to make a 2-mile loop to get back to where I currently am.  But I can't get off the road, as there's not enough room.  (a car is blocking me).  Even if I block the sidewalk (which also has heavy foot and bicycle traffic) I can't get out completely out of the high-speed travel lane.  So I'm stuck.  I'm blocking a major high-speed road with my right turn signal on.  \n\nI honk, many times.  I'm sure the whole neighborhood heard me honking.  I'm afraid I'm going to get rear-ended at first.  But then traffic starts backing up WAY behind me.   And lots of other frustrated drivers are honking and making very dangerous moves to get around me.   ?!?!?!??\n\nFinally, about 10 minutes later, with traffic backed up through two traffic lights, I see a \\~35 year old lady walking out of the Pizza Hut next door, carrying a pizza.  And guess where she's headed?  To the car blocking the gate.  Now several drivers are honking and yelling at her.  She gets in her car.  But now she's got a problem.  She needs to back out.  And she can't back out into my lane.  So she has to back out across two or three lanes of traffic.  \n\nAfter another few minutes of waiting for traffic to clear (it never does) she guns it across three lanes in reverse, causing other drivers to lock up the wheels to avoid slamming into her.  \n\n(IF anybody ever deserved to be towed...)",

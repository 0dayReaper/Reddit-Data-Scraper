Your choice makes sense, especially if you're getting the feeling he's seeing you as benefiting from him in a higher priced rental. It's a great compromise.",

With the upcoming move, we are starting to experience making important financial decisions together, which has been a bit of a challenge thus far. \n\nFor some context, he makes about 30% more than me and is usually pretty generous with me, albeit we\u2019ve never had to make any significant shared financial decisions before.\n\nFor example, if we go out for dinner, we take turns paying for the bill but if I were to estimate, he\u2019ll do it more often and pick up the more expensive meals. I really appreciate this and think it is kind of him, however, I want to emphasize that I never demand to go out to eat at fancy restaurants and am just as happy eating at home. Usually on my birthday, I\u2019ll suggest ordering a pizza and staying in or going to all you can eat sushi. \n\nRecently, we had to make the decision of what kind of apartment we wanted to rent together. He wanted to be near the subway and be in a newer, renovated / nicer place than his current unit. We toured a couple of apartments close to the subway line that we were hopeful for in the $3300/month range, but weren\u2019t overly impressed with any. \n\nUntil, I had a friend offer to rent his place out to us below market price for about $3100. I really loved the location, how nicely it was renovated, and how much value it was compared to the other places we toured. Although my friends place is very close to my office, it is around a 10 min walk to the nearest subway station (which I don\u2019t think is that bad??). But, my boyfriend did not like this fact and wasn\u2019t as in love with the place as I was. \n\nI was a little anxious about his decision because I was pretty confident we would not find better. He doesn\u2019t mind paying more and his budget would probably be around the $3800 range. Of course, the precedent was that we were to split the rent 50/50 but because I was scared that he\u2019d make me skip out on this opportunity and I\u2019d end up having to pay more for a place I liked less, I suggested that if he wanted to pass and keep looking at more expensive options, my ceiling would now be $1550 for my share of rent. \n\nI thought I was making a compromise by suggesting this, as I would be willing to pass on the unit I really loved if he would at least cover the rent difference.\n\nHowever, he\u2019s not happy I suggested this because he feels like I\u2019m forcing his hand into picking my friends place. I get the sense that he feels like I\u2019m planning to benefit off him paying more of the rent for a \u201cnicer\u201d place. But it\u2019s not like I arbitrarily set a random cap, it\u2019s only because I love my friends place and it is an actual, existing opportunity he would have expected me to pass up. I was just trying to say I\u2019d be willing to pass it up if he could pay the difference but, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "comment": "YTA - previous to being offered your friends apartment you were willing to spend x amount of dollars on rent and splitting it 50/50. You now are choosing to lower that cap because you know your friends place is much cheaper, but your boyfriend doesn\u2019t want to live there and wants to keep looking. I think you are right for wanting to live within your means but clearly you were already uncomfortable with rent that was going to be approx. 3300$ a month and should have voiced that at the beginning. You should choose rent you can afford, but it doesn\u2019t make you not the asshole for changing your budget in the middle of things and then asking your boyfriend to foot the rest after agreeing to 50/50 knowing he made more than you.",

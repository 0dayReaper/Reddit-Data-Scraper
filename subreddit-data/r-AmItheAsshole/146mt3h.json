Forcing a pet onto a reluctant recipient is not fair to the recipient or to the animal.\n\nTry explaining it to your mother in those terms. Tell her the welfare of the kitten must come first, and it is not fair on the kitten to give it to someone who isn't 100% enthusiastic about the idea.\n\n*she got very sad very quickly. And tells me she wanted to get me a present.*\n\nIs there something else (not an animal!) that *would* suit you, that she could give you as a present?\n\nIf the answer is no, or if she had her heart set on giving you this kitten and will not be satisfied with giving you anything else - then sorry, she's going to have to be disappointed. Your position is an extremely reasonable one.\n\nUltimately, her feelings are *her* feelings, and not your responsibility. If she chooses to be sad, so be it.",

My mother is currently in diasbility housing until she is able to come home due to major surgey. I am currently living at home with my father. And I had a cat when I was much younger (important later). \n\nYesterday afternoon my mother sends me two pictures of kittens with no context. So I reply \"cute cats\" she then goes on she then tells me about wanting one of them, I assumed it was for herself, but knew that myself and my father (both of us are quite time poor currently, and will be more so when supporting her when she is able to return home) are going to be left just looking after it due to mother's disability. \n\nI was made aware around 2 hours ago that the kitten is a gift for me, and I have the rest of tonight to decide it whether I want it as it will be picked up tomorrow.\nWhilst on the phone to my mother, she said that since I loved my cat when I was younger and she is no longer with us, that this is a nice gift because I missed her (cat). (Of course I was sad when she passed, she was my childhood pet and was very loved).\nI have explained being time poor, but mother insists the kitten can be put in the enclosure we had built for my first cat. \nI then explained being a kitten it needs time and training etc. She simply made the same remark about putting it in the enclosure and it would love it as it is semi inside/outside but fully enclosed. \nWhen I told her I didn't really want it she got very sad very quickly. And tells me she wanted to get me a present, she wanted something nice for me. \nShe has also argued with my father about it as he feels the same way as I do, especially with being so time poor. She is mad at him for allegedly \"influencing my decision\"\nI just feel guilty no matter what I decide. I know I would end up caring for the cat, I do love animals but had not wanted nor planned on getting any animal in the near future.\nI told her I appreciate the thought, but also would have appreciated some say and more notice and time to decides. She said I have the rest of the night to decide.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

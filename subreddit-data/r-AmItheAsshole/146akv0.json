    "postText": "I (27F) have a kid \"Eddie\"(9) with \"Pete\" (35M). \n\nPete and his partner \"Chloe\" have been together for 2 years and are getting married next year. Chloe and Pete decided that prior to their marriage they would find Eddie, so Pete would involve EDDIE in their wedding. \n\nThe problem is Eddie hasn't been hidden from Pete. Pete just hasn't bothered... he blocked me on social media and threatened every couple years to obtain my child from me.\n\n I'd call the police, they couldn't find him based off the lack of information (name and rough area) by which Pete lived. Pete would block me and so continued our 10 year cycle: Contact me, try and obtain my child, I'd call police, he'd block me &amp; change his information. \n\nSince Pete met Chloe, they've been reasonable with me in the 2 weeks they have been involved with Eddie, until I said they would NOT see Eddie alone without a court order...\n\nI've travelled 1 hour away from their home, 4 hours from mine so they could check he was the father, I've given them my address and the contact information for both of me and Eddie. \n\nAll I want is an agreement between us beforehand which is made into a court order to keep Eddie safe which sets out whom he lives with, when his dad sees him, and what decision his dad is responsible for.\n\nOr \n\nHe has supervised contact with me present, which may include my other child (2) until 9 year old is 16 and mainly responsible for himself and his actions. \n\nThe reasons for this are as follows:- \n* Pete has threatened to kidnap Eddie a fair few times\n* Pete and Chloe aren't people I know. It's been 10 years since I've known anything about Pete other than his name and general area. I don't know anything about him now except his telephone number and address. \n* Pete and Chloe just keep pushing for Eddie to stay with them. \n\nEddie has been made aware of my opinion, my angle and why I am doing all of this. I have never lied and will never lie to either of my children unless it's about magic (Santa, tooth fairy etc).\n\n Me and Eddie do not share beliefs about a lot of things, but given that he also knows nothing about his father he isn't comfortable just taking him either or being left in his father's care without a protective court order. \n\nPete and Chloe are now blocked from my social media and telephone until Eddie says otherwise, but they believe I am being the asshole. My mother agrees I am, but my family and friends don't believe I am as I'm just trying to protect my son from a stranger. So AITA?\n\nEdit 1: thank you everyone for your NTA. I find it really supportive to know I'm not going mad and that you've all noticed my son is part of the decision making process. You're all right that he's 9 almost 10 and so has every right to his say in this matter. I think I'm going to now pursue child maintenance.",

He might\u2019ve grown and matured in the last few years and is trying to write wrongs. And that has the potential to be a good role model for Eddie.\nSo I think that it is incredible that you're willing and actively trying to facilitate a relationship and not hold onto the past to weaponise in the present. You should be incredibly proud of yourself for that\n\nYou have also involved Eddie in the decision-making because he definitely deserves a say... again, it is incredibly good work and amazing that you respect your sons decision making.",

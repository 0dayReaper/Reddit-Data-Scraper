    "postText": "I don't use Reddit much so sorry if this isn't written right.\n\nFor context, my mother (54) and I (20) are both disabled in varying ways, she's recovering from surgery and also has chronic pain, and I have something wrong with me that makes it so that standing and walking are sometimes painful/uncomfortable. My stepdad (63) is to my knowledge not disabled besides some back pain and he is pretty active.\n\nI'm currently home from college and I'll admit I don't do much to help financially. I don't have a job and working currently is difficult because I don't have a car. But I still try to help around the house with cooking or cleaning when I can, with context that bending down and such gets painful after a while.\n\nMy stepdad was gone for about a week since he was visiting his family in another state. During this, my mother had complained to me that she was annoyed that he would never bring his dishes to the sink and that his brother (who had visited recently) also never did anything. I think it's unfair that he leaves a lot of things for us to clean up.\n\nLast night, we had dinner and he left his silverware, dirty napkins, and his empty beer can atop his plate, which he left in front of his seat and not at the sink which was a few paces away. I asked him first if he was done eating, and then when he said yes, I asked him, \"Could you put your beer can in the recycling?\"\n\nThis pissed him off greatly. He said, \"Uh, I was hoping someone else could do it,\" then stormed out. I didn't catch what he said but it was something along the lines of \"This is fucking bullshit\" and \"I worked all week\" and whatever.\n\nI'll admit that I could have phrased it more politely. I'm autistic and so things that I say that I mean in the most genuine, literal sense sometimes come across as rude, which wasn't my intent. I wasn't even trying to be passive aggressive. My mother then lectured me and told me that he was offended because \"he helps out a lot financially\" and that I don't help financially so it seemed rude to him.\n\nMy issue is that I asked him a relatively simple thing, in my opinion. I understand that he helps out financially, but my mother is (1) recovering from surgery, (2) chronically ill, and (3) working a full time job, but he also still expects her to cook and keep the house clean on top of everything. I don't even mind that he doesn't do the dishes, all I wanted was for him to deal with his own trash. But by the end of the conversation I felt that I was being an asshole about it and I'm wondering if it was my fault in the first place. AITA?",

            "comment": "NTA for asking but you're (unknowingly ?) challenging the unspoken house &amp; relationship dynamic.\n\nHe believes since he works there is no need for him to throw away a can nor walk his plates to the kitchen. He'd never dream of cooking or cleaning. You mom is expected to work, cook and clean. Perhaps he's upset that you don't work and cover your expense (?) thus his reaction when you asked him to pitch the can.  Unfortunately, your mom, through her actions, agreed to this house/relationship agreement. \n\nI'd want my mom's life to be easier such as her partner changing to take on roles that support her. But we can wish our lives away. It's up to them to create this change and your stuck navigating the dance. Keep focused on your life goals and create what you think is loving and equitable.  We don't have to repeat our parent's decisions.",

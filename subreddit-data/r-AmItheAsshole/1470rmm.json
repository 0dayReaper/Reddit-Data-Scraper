    "postText": "Hi reddit, I (20F) have upset my mother (50F) a lot yesterday, and I need some unbiased opinions on how much I was in the wrong.\n\nAs the title says, my parents have been blowing up my phone over the past two days, if i don\u2019t immediately respond because i\u2019m sleeping/eating/watching a movie they continuously call. I\u2019ve been living away from home for 2 years now and the topic of the excessive phone calling has been a constant issue. \n\ni thought i was making progress with my parents, especially my mother, with getting them to understand that i do not want to call and chat with them for 2-3 hours everyday, i have my own life going on and i\u2019m not a very social person. in the last few months it\u2019s been great, my mother only calls me 1-2times a week and it\u2019s prompted me to feel confident enough to also initiate contact and call her myself. we\u2019ve even been able to reach a stage where i had my first ever text conversation with my mother. we had a similar argument in the first few months of living away where i didn\u2019t answer calls for 1 day cause i was out in town and they threatened to call the police on me. i lost it and i didn\u2019t contact them for about two weeks.\n\nonto yesterday, i flew back to my home country on thursday night cause i have some stuff to sort out, since friday i\u2019ve progressively gotten more annoyed at their pestering. i counted, 20 calls on friday, 21 on saturday. i was going crazy. i\u2019m staying in their house, they\u2019ve got cameras outside and can see if i step a foot outside yet they find the need to monitor my every move. godforbid i stay in bed for two days since it\u2019s the first time i took a break from work and uni in a while. needless to say, i blew up again. my mother called me around 6pm and i told her off for calling me 4 times within an hr, told her i wanted some alone time just playing on my switch for a bit, reminded her that i do not like phone calls or to chat all day long like she does. this is where i may be the asshole, i\u2019m not as fluent in my home language as i am in english i may have been harsher than i intended and she interpreted it as me saying that my games and netflix are more important than her.\n\ni got woken up at 8am by my brother (31) climbing onto my balcony and a shit ton of calls from my father. my mum texted him at about 2am about how i upset her and she\u2019s been crying all night and how ungrateful i am, she blocked me and my dad (she\u2019s since made up with my dad but not me)\n\ni will definitely apologise to her for upsetting her so much, that wasn\u2019t my intention, but it\u2019s also incredibly frustrating how i\u2019ve been developing this boundary with them both for two years and all of a sudden they decide to throw it all away. \n\nalso, i don\u2019t even call my boyfriend of almost 2 years we text 99% of the time. \nmy parents exclusively facetime, they never call normally or give a heads up. \n\nso reddit, did i overreact? how should i apologise? aita?",

    "postText": "[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t622tm/aita_for_imposing_my_culture_even_though_i/)\n\nFirst of all I just want to thank everyone for the overwhelming support and replies on my first post. I'm looking forward to going over to everyone's houses for dinner and I'll be sure to bring all the things you said you liked :-) many flower lovers out there! I'm now also apparently the DIL to a lot of hopeful parents that replied as well so I hope I can deliver on expectations!\n\n\\---\n\nAfter my last update I told my bf I was sick and tired of him dancing around the issue with his parents and I was going to go over to their house whether he liked it or not. At this point I think he realized that whatever he was doing had backfired so he sat down all angry and told me he'd explain. I sat and he told me that he'd done something very spur of the moment and that he'd texted me from his dad's phone then blocked the number but begged me to listen. That he just needed to get his parents off me for a while and to not leave.\n\nApparently his parents had started hinting at him about marriage since my bf and I talked a lot about it. I fully expected to marry him as I said in another comment, and was honestly expecting a proposal in late spring since that's when we met. Four years dating didn't bother me but I was getting excited to settle down. However, my bf apparently realized that he absolutely didn't want to commit to anything and wanted to experiment and have fun since I \"wasn't being fun anymore\". Honestly that just made me cry since we were each other's firsts for everything and usually very good at communicating our needs.\n\nHis grand plan was to get him mad at me so I would beg for forgiveness and then he'd only accept an open relationship as an answer. Absolutely brilliant plan I know. He'd made up his parents getting mad but didn't expect me to blow off dinner completely and it's like \"hitting a jackpot\", his words not mine. He went over for dinner, hid the flowers and said we'd gotten into a huge fight but he was \"going to fix it\" but I needed space. After he confessed all this he said he was very sorry but really didn't want to miss out on new experiences when he was still young and would I consider an open relationship but pretend ours was strained with his parents so they wouldn't get suspicious?\n\nAnd.....I laughed. I laughed his ass right out the door and told him absolutely not and to leave me alone while I packed because I wanted to have some new experiences too!!! He never stopped begging me to stay but I left to sleep at a friend's. After calming down for a few days I cemented the breakup and finally, actually went over to his parent's. My ex-bf's dad never even noticed the phone missing but still apologized and his mom was a mess. I did and still love them and will eat dinner there without *him* as often as I can. I won't lie that I'm sad about four years down the drain, but that's life. And if that was my ex's best possible plan then I dodged the bullet by a mile.",

He was so concerned about keeping up appearances for his parents that he straight up waged psychological warfare on you, but now it's all nice and out in the open. Gonna be awkward for him at holidays for a few years.",

When he brings up wanting a threesome, say \"I was thinking the same thing!\" and start enthusiastically listing off men you've been pining for. Act very confused when he says that \"isn't quite what I had in mind...\"\n\nPlay dumb for an uncomfortable amount of time. Make him explain what he did and did not have in mind, and why. Make it awkward. Because it IS awkward to request your partner allow you sexual freedom that only goes one way (or only goes \"their way\").",

That's usually a sign that your world would be better without certain toxic elements in it, whether that's people or environment. It's also a good sign that it's time to see a doctor and either start or adjust meds; and get to a counsellor any way possible. \n\nRegarding help lines \u2014 if you have any idea what the biggest factor might be, is there a line specifically for that? ie LGBTIQA+, domestic/family violence, specialised assault counselling, grief support...? Sometimes you can find resources for counselling or support groups through those help lines that the more generic ones don't have. \n\nAnd if you reach out to people around you and don't get a response (or worse, get a dismissive and nasty one), reach out again. This time to someone else. You're worth saving.",

I\u2019m 65, a woman and a feminist. When my husband and I had been married about four months we decided to start our family. Long story, way shorter, we had four kids in seven years and I was able to stay home with them. I was excited about having babies and raising our kids. It was my decision to be a SAHM. \n\nThere were a lot of women who looked down on me and pitied me for being a SAHM and \u201chousewife\u201d. I told them that:\n1 I loved being with my kids (I still like most kids better than adults.)\n\n2 I was NOT married to my house! Both my husband and I took care of our house and kids. \n\nAnd most importantly, I thought that being a feminist meant being able to choose what you did with your life. I chose to be totally hands on with my kids. We did Mommy &amp; Me activities, I volunteered at their preschool, grade school and helped out in the middle and high schools, too. \n\nI always try to see all sides of an issue, but people who automatically assume the worst are annoying as hell.\n\nEdited to add: I forgot that using the hashtag would make my print bold! I\u2019m going to try taking it out. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb",

FORCING anyone into it is a great way to destroy your relationship as they'll likely then see there is a LOT of interest in them by other people that are more mature, better at communication and actually appreciative of them.",

She's still convinced her ex was justified in breaking up with her &amp; having his \"technically we weren't together\" fling because she texted his Mum something like, \"have a great holiday\" &amp; he convinced her that was being \"invasive with his family.\"\n\nLike it seems your ex recently discovered the wrong side of the internet.

And if you\u2019re using dating apps, you\u2019re competing with 50+ other men for a handful of women who don\u2019t mind screwing someone in an open relationship (and if they \u201cthink they have something lined up,\u201d it\u2019s got a good chance of falling through for numerous reasons).

Unfortunately, the whole \"guy getting itchy feet so tries to force his partner to open the relationship\" isn't an uncommon scenario. These are the common ways it plays out:\n\n1.) In 6 months to a year, your ex will realise how shitty &amp; difficult it is to be single &amp; meet someone in 2022 &amp; will try &amp; insert himself back into your life. \n\n2.) As soon as you meet someone else, he realises he f- up &amp; tried to reinsert himself back into your life\n\n3.A.) Your ex has already been talking to someone &amp; had someone lined up for this \"open relationship\". Ex seems to move on quickly but you hear from him as soon as you move on or they break up.\n\n3.B.) Your ex had someone lined up but it turns out he was delusional &amp; misread the situation &amp; is begging for you back within weeks once he realises he blew up your relationship for nothing.\n\n\nJust be prepared because as much as you want to stay in touch with your former in-laws, unfortunately that may not be possible because of your ex. You are so much better off without someone like that in your life &amp; I wish you well.",

I don't find it particularly strange since they use facebook, videochat friends, play candy crush etc. on their ipads and don't have much use for a phone. They find ipads easier to use and also go everywhere together (very cute I know) so if someone really does need to call them the other is right there.\r  \n\r  \nPreviously my bf had absolutely no problem whatsoever with me bringing gifts anywhere. Like I said in a comment he'd helped me pick things out before and is usually great at communicating whenever he feels we need to talk about something which is why I was so confused with him. He knows it's how I was raised and was respectful to every other aspect of my upbringing. His parents are not poor and raised him with good manners and etiquette.\r  \n\r  \nI saw a lot of other people comment on what I was bringing, and no, I wasn't bringing gigantic vases with wilted flowers or an entire cake or multiple bottles of the same type of wine every week. Whenever I did bring something edible it was small and we'd usually consume it with dinner and as for the flowers I'd usually just leave them in the plastic wrap they came with with water. The vase was a rare thing that my bf's mom could've used for dozens of things since it was a clear glass.\n\nI also wanted to add that I'm so sorry the mods here had to deal with all the remind me update spam, I quite literally got thousands of replies and follows and update messages so I can't imagine how busy and stressful it was for you.

Imagine if he waited until you two were married for 5 years with two kids. Still stinks that he did this after 4 years of dating but so good he showed his true colors before you married him. \n\nI'm so glad you laughed him out the door. You are amazing and deserve so much more than what he could give. Sounds like his parents are going to rake him over the coals for blowing it with you in such a disgusting way.",

He was asking for permission to cheat. \n\nAsking for polyamory fully accepts the fact that she will have her other relationships, too, and everyone participating might end up knowing one another on some level.\n\nHe don't want that smoke. He just wants to fuck around.\n\nAnd here's the thing\u2014if he was open about fucking around, I would respect that. \"Sorry, but I don't think I can do this, it just feels like I never got to know myself only having ever experienced one relationship and one woman.\"\n\nBut no, he went full manipulation and did something entirely convoluted to try to have both worlds, because he knew if he asked the answer would be \"No\", but he also didn't want to lose her.\n\nNow the dumbass probably won't have either world.",

Especially once they realize they're not the hot stuff they think they are, and there's not a line of women waiting for them and their winning character. Gee, who could've guessed? \n\nYou seem like a really nice person and you could do a lot better than a manipulative guy like him. Take your time to heal from this! And don't let him back in, people like this generally don't get better. If anything, they often get worse if they realize they can hurt you and you'll just take them back afterwards.\n\nLove that you had the self respect to laugh in his face when he tried to bargain. Sounds like he didn't ruin that at least!\n\nOnwards and upwards OP!",

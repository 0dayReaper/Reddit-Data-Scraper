Please view our [voting guide here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what.2019s_with_these_acronyms.3F_what_do_they_mean.3F), and remember to use **only one** judgement in your comment.\n\nOP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:\n\n &gt; During the dinner party I tried to keep myself calm and did not say anything to Stepdaughter - first because she is an adult, and second because both her parents were present.  After a week passed with no sign or remorse or acknowledgment of how unacceptable her behavior was - I then spoke with my husband about it.  I expressed that while I sat through this dinner, I would never again sit through or be part of anything so publicly humiliating. I explained that if this had been at a dive bar or a private home - that it would be different. But this was a nice restaurant with families dining and people I knew - which made this beyond just letting loose.  He feels I am being judgmental against his daughter - who he feels did nothing wrong.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The dinner was at a nice restaurant with 10 guests. She and her friends showed up completely drunk. She proceeded to continue to drink heavily, speaking loudly, and topped it off by using a racial accent while offering blow jobs - and laughing at everyone. I was mortified and shocked that neither her bio mother or my husband said a word to stop her. In my entire life, I have never been so humiliated in public - especially since there were people in the restaurant that I knew and this is our community. After dinner, I went home disgusted.  I waited a week to see if we would get an apology or recognition of her poor behavior, but nothing was said.  Finally, I told my husband how I felt and he was upset with me.  He said I was being overly sensitive and that she was just hanging loose.  I assured him that if either of my adult children behaved that way, I would have put a quick stop to that behavior. Now he\u2019s upset with me and says that I\u2019m being judgmental.  AITA\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I was embarrassed to be a part of it. I never said a word to her - just my husband.

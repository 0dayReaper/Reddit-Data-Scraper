    "postText": "For some background, me (37F) my husband (42M) and my 2 daughters (17 and 4) live in my BILs (47M) house, he bought it with the express purpose of us all moving in together, he pays the mortgage out of his veterans benefits, and we pay for all utilities, upkeep, groceries for all of us, etc. He refuses us paying rent because it would be an income and he would lose his veterans benefits, so instead we just pay all of the bills.\n\nHe has been becoming more and more unpleasant to be around, hes been drinking almost nightly, and getting falling down drunk, and I've been keeping myself and my 4 year old in our bedroom for much longer stretches during the day while my husband is at work, only leaving the bedroom when I need to make meals, or I need to do household chores. I upkeep the house, do all of the chores, dishes, laundry, etc. I alone do 100% of the housework, my husband does all of the mechanical work on our 3 vehicles (including BILs) and house repairs, and he works full time, and BIL does yardwork twice a month, the rest of the time BIL sits on the couch in the livingroom, playing Xbox, for about 15 hours a day he is on Xbox. Then he sleeps on the couch even though he has the master bedroom.\n\nI've been more stressed out lately, in April I found out I was 4 months pregnant (due in September) and 3 weeks ago my dad, who I was pretty close with, died. I've been grieving pretty hard and dealing with pregnancy hormones on top of the grief, so I've been shorter tempered than normal. My BIL however had been raising his voice and yelling at my 4 year old, and butting into our private conversations more and more, I've been really struggling with *not* telling him to mind his own business and stop yelling at my daughter when I'm right in the same room. \n\nTonight, my 4 year old accidentally swiped her full bowl of cereal with milk off the table. I raised my voice for a second and said \"what the hell?! Why did you do that?!\" She started crying and I stopped yelling with just that sentence and started cleaning up. I injured my knee several weeks ago and can't kneel down, so I have to bend over to reach the floor. She was crying the whole time I was cleaning up and he came in and started yelling at her for crying, and I just had it and snapped at him. I yelled \"you don't need to.. she's fine, she's just crying cause she made a mess and I yelled\" but I yelled it at him. Ever since then he has been sitting on the couch on the Xbox, whispering to himself under his breath and I'm wondering if I crossed the line by yelling at him in his house, even though I was defending my 4 year old? As soon as I was done cleaning up, I picked her up and calmed her down, I apologized for yelling at her and made her feel better, so she is good, laughing and has completely emotionally recovered.. but I need to know from an outside perspective if I also need to apologize to my BIL for yelling at him for yelling at my daughter while I was in the same room?",

He is not off the hook for butting in like that and owes you an apology too, but don't know if you can expect that.  \n\nThis might be a good economic deal for your family, but sounds like the situation is deteriorating and you really need to talk to your husband about that.

It sounds as if he's been coming apart at the seams and yelling inappropriately; as the child's mother, tell him to stop!  It's your job to protect your child.  You have nothing, zero, zip to apologize for.\n\nAnd now for some suggestions that you might not want to hear.\n\n1.) Your BIL is an alcoholic, and a mean one at that.  He's falling down drunk every night.  It's not safe for your kid to be around this guy.  See if your husband can get him to AA, preferably through a nearby VA, or into a veterans group.  He sounds like he needs help, and he needs it now.\n\n2.)  If your BIL doesn't immediately do something to address his alcoholism and his unacceptable behavior, talk with your husband about getting out of there.  Your BIL can make a similar questionable financial arrangement with a different roommates, or he can sell the house and make different living arrangements.  \n\nBut it isn't good for you to spend your pregnancy with the kind of anxiety and stress that living with this guy is causing.  Hiding in your room with your child is not a safe, stable way to live.\n\nGet out.\n\nNTA",

He went into the army with a bad back, in hopes that 1 of 2 things would happen, the army would pay to fix his back, or he would get disability benefits. \n\nHe was not even out of basic, he had been in for 8 weeks when his back problems started flaring up (he still had 2 weeks left of basic, he never got an assignment) when they sent him for surgery. Surgery didn't fix it, so he was discharged and given 100% disabled veterans benefits. \n\nWe have sat down and spoken about us moving out, he says every time that he doesn't want it to happen, he is lonely and doesn't make friends easily, and gets depressed easily. He has said repeatedly that he would spiral if we moved. \n\nWe would also have to move out of state because we don't make enough to rent in our current state. I am currently out of work due to being pregnant and we are living on my husband's single income. None of us (BIL included) want us to move out of state. My 17 year old probably most of all. We have been actively hunting for a reasonably priced rental within the state for *months*, but the housing market is just too competitive right now. We've been searching for a new place since even before I found out I was pregnant. We make $76 a month too much to qualify for assistance programs as well.",

However, I'm very sorry to say that I agree with the other people who feel you've become a bit of TA toward yourself and your own family. I've lived with an alcoholic and a 4yo before, so I absolutely understand what your situation is like. You have all of my sympathies, babe, because this shit is hard. One of the biggest difficulties with this sort of living situation is that you spend so much of your time and energy avoiding the abusive drunk that you begin to not have time to think clearly, make a plan to change the situation, etc. It can create a risk of growing blind to some of your own poor choices, because you're making them in survival mode. \n\nBut I need you to take a step back from the fog of alcoholic codependency for a second to take an honest look at the home environment you're providing for that sweet little girl. Can she thrive as she should when she's cooped up in a very cramped space with her mom all day? Can she develop healthy emotional intelligence when an angry man is modeling the exact opposite all day? Can she develop strong trusting bonds with her caregivers if she's afraid of being screamed at for mistakes that are appropriate for her age and development level? Children thrive in adverse situations all the time, but you still owe her a solid chance at a happy, successful life. That isn't likely to happen in the home environment you've described to us. That's a profoundly hard thing for a mother to confront, and so I'm sorry for being a bit blunt with you. But in addition to the personal experience I mentioned, I also have nearly 20 years of experience in family law. I often advise clients in similar situations to make decisions going forward by asking themselves how they'd explain it to CPS. I hope you'll be brave enough to recognize that you're going to need to make some big changes to promote the welfare of your precious children.",

But it sounds quick to report a pregnant woman with a potentially alcoholic and controlling brother in law whose father just died as abusive. \n\nA complete dick to her kid in that moment? YES. 100%. Also clearly she realized she was wrong which is why she told him not to yell at her... that doesn't make someone a hypocrite. That makes them aware that they were wrong and won't let someone else repeat their bad action. \n\nAlso she says raise her voice at first and then says stopped the yelling. We don't know if that was actually yelling or not. I was a sensitive kid and anything above a low pitched speaking voice made me cry cause I thought it was yelling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just think that's a strong word to use. Coming from experience of my mom raising her voice ever so slightly (not yelling) when I threw a ball in the house. The moment my cousin's grandfather came in and yelled at me, she immediately turned on him because he had no right. If someone called my mom abusive over that I'd be pissed.",

Also she would need to yell that her her daily and multiple times. Again you dont know with out being there and seeing it first hand or by witness account of her ongoing violent yells and assuming over the Internet does make you unprofessional.

Why did you do that?!\" She started crying and *I stopped yelling with just that sentence* and started cleaning up.\"\n\nI literally just raised my voice for one sentence, it wasn't even a complete sentence, and then I stopped because I knew it wasn't the right reaction, it was just knee jerk out of surprise from seeing her swipe a bowl of cereal with milk off the table with her arm, like how people swipe desks clean in movies. I was shocked. But I also went on to say... \n\n\"As soon as I was done cleaning up, I picked her up and calmed her down, I apologized for yelling at her and made her feel better, so she is good, laughing\" \n\nI don't often raise my voice. It wasn't a scream yell, it was just escalated. I would call it yelling for me, but compared to some moms I've heard it wouldn't be considered a yell, so it comes down to semantics. She cried because I rarely raise my voice and it startled her. I stated in my post that I apologized for it, which in my opinion is acknowledging that my action was wrong. I took measures to correct my wrong action, and like I said, it really doesn't happen often, but I've had a lot more stress lately and been on edge, so occasionally (I'd say less than once every 2 weeks, tops) I raise my voice. I do not *ever* verbally abuse her, so I'm not worried about this \"mandated reporter\" calling me abusive, I know I'm not. My daughter and I have a good relationship. \n\nShould I have calmed her down and apologized before cleaning up? Yes, but I was also concerned about BILs reaction to a giant cereal and milk mess not being promptly cleaned up, I prioritized the wrong thing first, and I can see that and acknowledge it, and make sure I don't do the same thing going forward.",

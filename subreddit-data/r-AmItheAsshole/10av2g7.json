She agreed to wear the dress you picked out, and then deceitfully planned to change at the last moment in the hope that you'd just let her get away with it. She knew that you would tell her no.\n\nThink of being in a wedding as like playing a part in a play, or a ballet, or something. You get cast as \"bridesmaid\", so you wear the costume that the artistic director has picked out for bridesmaids to wear. If you don't want to wear the costume, don't be in the show. But you can't just show up on opening night and say \"I didn't like your costume choices, so I'm going to wear the same costume as this other character instead\".\n\nETA: Thanks for all the love, everyone!",

Even better, what Kat did is often called \"main character syndrome.\" Every event she's in - including ones where she cast herself - has to be about her.\n\nAnd if I were OP I would publicly call Kat out on just those terms: *Kat, as you know you were not among my picks for bridesmaid; you approached me and asked to be included.Did you plan to hijack this from the start? And oh, by the way, you got the who-owes-who backward: I expect YOU to reimburse ME for the dress I paid for and that you clearly had no intention of ever wearing.*\n\nIf OP is in the United States, that should flip the script pretty thoroughly; it's customary for bridesmaids to pay for their own dresses (though many brides do cover that cost).",

As someone above stated, she agreed to play the part of the bridesmaid and that means wearing the costume (dress) you picked out. If she\u2019s really so insecure that she can\u2019t be seen in a non-preferred color then she should have dropped out. There are SO many crazy brides out there making ridiculous demands of their wedding party and/or guests. All you did was expect your wedding party to wear the attire you picked out. That is a very basic wedding expectation. \n\nGood riddance to insecure drama queen Kat, and I\u2019d reevaluate any other friend that tells you you\u2019re wrong for expecting basic respect and honesty from a friend on your wedding day. Good on you for not letting someone stomp on your boundaries.",

He was like \"I totally understand if you wouldn't want to, you'd have to wear a rainbow outfit but I'm not sure if I want tuxes or dresses and I wouldn't want to upset you if I picked dresses\"\n\n\nDude, I'm comfortable enough in my sexuality, you could ask me to wear a rainbow speedo and bow tie and I'll be there.  I'm honored you'd want me in your wedding. He started crying and hugging me. \n\n\nI agreed to my role, knowing very well what I'll be getting into, I'm going to play my role as scripted. Is it my ideal outfit? Not really. Am I going to do what I can to make sure he's happy on his special day?  You're damn right.",

They gave my blonde, looks like Jessica Lange, seatmate in the dressing room an auburn wig. The entire season we kept saying how much better we would look in different wigs. So, the last night? We switched.\n\nGuess what happened? They found out and the stage manager, costume mistress, and director came down. They held curtain, made us change wigs, chewed us to bits, and almost fined us $400. The wings were hand-made by the Met's wig maker, cost a fortune, and were custom-made. But, as the director accurately pointed out...above all, \"WE MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. NOT YOU.\"\n\nIt was a painful, but valuable lesson. I hope that this \"friend\" learns from this and grows the heck up. I sure did. NTA\nEDIT: I was not in the Met. I was good at 17 but not THAT good, LOL. It was a custom wigs made my the wigmaker for the Metropolitan Opera Company so it was super spendy. I added a comment explaining but it is kinda buried. Sorry for the confusion!",

If you, bridesmaid, dont like the dress the bride chose for you to wear, you have 2 choices: suck it up and wear it or politely decline to participate. NOT show up with your preferred dress and expect the bride will allow it. She won't.  \n\nAnd expecting the bride to reimburse you for the dress you wanted? Wear it somewhere else, drama queen.\n\nNTA.",

It is one thing if a bride chooses a theme and lets people choose their own flattering clothes to fit the theme\u2014it seems appropriate for wedding party to pay then. I\u2019ve always thought it was really weird to pick specific dresses that the party will never wear again and make them pay. Or making the party pay for tux rental. I know it is common practice in the US, but I remember a friend of mine was in four weddings one summer and was frantically trying to save a few thousand dollars to cover his expenses with nothing to show for that on the other side except being their for his friend. \n\nBut in any event, OP paid, friend agreed to wear the dress, end of story.

I'm not one of those people who subscribes to the blind \"my day, my way\" mantra that gives couples a pass to mistreat the people closest to them. However, it is standard practice that the couple chooses the bridal party attire. That's just a given. If someone doesn't like this wedding day custom, they can bow out.  \n\nOP is the host. OP paid for the dresses. It's not OP's fault that one person thought they were the star of the day, purchased their own dress, promoted themselves to co-MOH, threw a tantrum when told no, and then started verbally abusing the bride. At that point, there was nothing OP could have done but ask her to leave. I may have verbally asked her to leave before getting security involved, but I suspect there was no way this scenario would have played out peacefully.... This lady obviously lacked some common sense if she thinks OP owes her money for a dress that she was not asked to buy or wear.",

The dress she picked out was a skin tight, bright pink, strapless, tube dress that BARELY covered my ass and my breasts were almost fully popping out of. They were bought off the rack at the last minute (because she couldn\u2019t decide) and there was no time for alterations. I asked if I might purchase a shoulder wrap in the same color to cover myself but she said no, so I had to politely decline being in the ceremony. I truly felt that if I went forward, her wedding would forever be remembered as the day her bridesmaid flashed the entire church. \n\nWhen I asked if I could just attended the wedding as a guest she said no (which I thought was harsh) but I still think I made the best choice I could.\n\nNever once did I consider demanding to wear an entirely different style dress. Wtf is this bridesmaid\u2019s deal?",

If she was so opposed to forest green (your wedding theme sounds lovely, by the way) she could have just backed out of being a bridesmaid. But of course, she wanted the spotlight of being part of the wedding, without being a good friend and just wearing the green dress. \n\nGood for you for kicking her out, and no, you don't owe her a dime for her dress. Send her a bill for the green dress that she let you buy when she had no intention of wearing it.",

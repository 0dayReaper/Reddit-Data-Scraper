    "postText": "I'm the VP of Sales at a software company and one of our sales development reps parents passed away at the beginning of April, sadly they were involved in a car crash and both lost their lives. Now the employee in question in very young 22 year old guy and has been with us for about 10 months now. He's a great employee and we were thinking about promotions in the next \\~6 months for him. His job is a high paying one for a new grad, about \\~90k with commission and base so we expect a lot from this position. Because of the accident we let him take a 1 month paid leave of absence from work and he's returned a few weeks ago and his performance is severely lacking. He's super unmotivated, not cold calling, out reaching to prospects for the last 2-3 weeks enough since he's come back. Our whole mgmt team has noticed this and we decided to let him go because we feel like he'd need months and months to be able to produce again and we can't just wait that long.\n\nWe called him into a meeting on Friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. Told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. I thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.\n\nI told my boyfriend about all of this and he said myself and my mgmt team are a bunch of asses and pricks with no hearts.\n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Update\\*\\*\\*\n\nHoly fuck this blew up, I know this was shitty of me now. And I reached out to him to see how he's holding up. He's staying at his gf's place and she's supporting him a lot right now. I offered to get my head hunter friend in touch with him when he's ready and he accepted.",

He's been back for only 2-3 weeks.  \n\nIt's not about \"having heart\", it's about making a dumb business decision for both you and him.  So much smarter to work with this guy to get him back on track after a temporary setback than to push the eject button and have to find and start over with a new person.  Dumb.",

I was out performing all other people in my position in the district, and wanted to transfer somewhere closer to home. I saw the place closer to where I lived had a part time available, and I'd have to cut hours but I said to myself it's worth it. I apply for it, they first told me I had it then told me I didnt in the same day. I put in my 2 weeks right then. \n\nThe kicker, it took them 2 years to staff that position.

I was told \"that's what happens when you take a vacation \" by the owners daughter / office manager who did virtually no work but made 6 figures. He died on Wednesday,  I was back to work the next Wednesday.  No flowers sent, no bereavement pay, nothing. I had used all of my vacation already getting him treatment and into hospice. I had been there 4 years,  they had MET my dad....fuck people like that. Just assholes all around.\n\nETA: Yes, YTA and apparently have zero empathy.  I don't know if your parents are still alive, but you should hope you don't get fucked over by an employer if/when something happens to them like you did to this young man.",

Most importantly, they didn't abandon him, and he now speaks candidly about how having a job and purpose kept him engaged and provided him with a reason to go on and not take his own life too.\n\nAnd what'd y'all do? Sure, you have him a month of bereavement, and then treated him like every other \"normal\" employee upon his return. Can you practice a little empathy here? If BOTH your parents passed away in your early 20's, would a month be sufficient for your grieving? Maybe you're some sort of advanced human, buy this happens to my friend at age 29 in 2016 and he still lives his life one day at a time. \n\nThis is an excellent case of when you, as a manager, should've practiced equity over equality. Holding him to the standard of non-grieving employees is bananas, y'all are wylin. And the guilt that's gnawing away at your conscience? Well deserved \ud83d\udc4c",

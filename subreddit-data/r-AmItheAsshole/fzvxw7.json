    "postText": "I\u2019m 30 and my 12 year old sister is living with me right now because mom and pops are vulnerable so it made more sense for me to care for my sis for the time being. \n\nShe is a really great kid and tbh I feel in a lot of ways like she\u2019s my own kid because my mom and dad don\u2019t speak English so I kind of had to raise my sis in ways that they couldn\u2019t. Hard to explain but I\u2019m sure anyone with a secondary culture will get what I mean- my mom and dad are great parents but having an English speaking person to guide you through shit when you live in an English speaking country is invaluable imo and my sister trusts me with stuff she won\u2019t necessarily trust my parents with. \n\nAnyway my girlfriend was FaceTiming me and my sister walked past in shorts and a t shirt cuz it\u2019s hot. My ~~sister~~ gf waited til my sister had left the area ( but not the room) and made a face and said \u2018maybe feed her less OP, her thighs are kinda chunky\u2019 \n\nI saw red and told her to shut the fuck up (just came out my mouth) and immediately ended the call. My sister is a bit chubby but ffs who says stuff like that about a 12 year old girl. \n\nLiterally. Everybody. I. Know. Has been texting me that I\u2019m a POS boyfriend and that how can I disrespect my gf like that. I am expecting an apology from HER but to my shock everybody is expecting ME to apologize. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?",

It\u2019s one thing if you ask for advice or tell them but it\u2019s another if they text you unprompted about it.\n\nThere are people out there who, when they do something questionable and aren't certain they can win the argument 1 on 1, will quickly go around and \"organize\" everyone in their common friend group to be on their side. Usually, the tactic involves telling a semi-accurate, but slightly skewed version of what happened. It's just enough to make a bunch of these common friends feel like they have to call out the other person. \n\nThis tends to happen a lot in drama-filled social groups. My wife was in such a group many years ago when we first met. The childish way these people acted was amazing, and the \"organize and attack\" thing happened with alarming frequency. They were all big partiers, and going out drinking every night was basically all they had in common.\n\nOP might be well advised to do what my wife did, and just dump the whole dysfunctional friend group (including GF) and find a better class of friends.",

For reference, I was a 2-sport athlete in great shape, but because I had a strong frame instead of a thin frame, she kept insisting I was fat compared to my slim friends. \n\nI\u2019m 27 years old and I *just* got control on my binge eating disorder, and so far I\u2019ve lost 15 lbs. (but have 35 lbs to go until I\u2019m in healthy weight range again). It\u2019s been incredibly hard on my self-esteem, on my relationships and friendships, and especially my mental health. It\u2019s been a very difficult journey to overcome - and if I have kids, I\u2019ll never talk about their bodies like that because it left such a lasting impact on me.",

However I was always very very thin, and she is a \u201cthick girl\u201d, not fat by any means but she\u2019s got a big butt and big boobs for a 13 year old. Growing up we both experienced anxiety which was different. For me I lost my appetite and heavily controlled what I ate as a means to control my life. My sister snacks more when she\u2019s stressed which might contribute to this too. \n\nI\u2019m not just being a nice protective sister when I say this, but she really does wear her weight well. She\u2019s extremely popular and extroverted whereas I was always awkward and quiet. She exercises regularly and intensely (she\u2019s a competition ballerina) even now during the isolation, so her weight is put on in the good places and a lot of is is muscle anyways (like thighs). She has no reason to ever be worried about her weight as her doctor says it\u2019s completely within the realm of normalcy for a kid her age, especially in the intro of puberty. \n\nMy mom involves herself into my sisters diet in a way I don\u2019t think is healthy. Most breakfasts consist of protein shakes and nothing else, and my mom will loudly shame her in front of the family if she takes larger portion sizes or extra snacks. It pisses me off so much. I think my mom thinks my sister is overweight because I was so severely underweight and so was my brother, so she expected my sister to be small too. But ever since she was no longer a toddler she\u2019s been a \u201cbig kid\u201d and that\u2019s not a bad thing. Doctors say she\u2019s healthy, strangers say she\u2019s pretty, she doesn\u2019t have a single physical issue from weight aside from back pain from her boobs if you count that. But she\u2019s too young for a breast reduction as they won\u2019t do it until she\u2019s \u201cfully developed\u201d\n\nYour comment reminded me about how everyone will uplift her then my mom will just *once* say \u201coh, you\u2019re getting MORE dinner?\u201d and it\u2019s like all the kind words fall out of her head and she becomes an empty shell.

She proved she has no problem discussing a 12 year olds body and then ran around making herself the victim, that does not seem like a one off changeable behavior. What about the next time they argue? Do you really believe she won't run to friends again to back her up? She did it once and can do it again, and this isn't really changeable behavior cause she may not ever SAY any comments to OP but she def will be thinking them and telling other people because that is obviously how she feels about the little sister but will learn not to tell OP. People like that don't change, I've dealt with enough assholes like that to know, they just change their tactics. Personally I couldn't trust her again and trust is a huge part of any relationship and if OP can't trust her then for everyone's sake they should end it",

It's insane that these are viewed on the same level. I've seen judgments where both parties are considered assholes but still NTA/YTA are chosen because the gravity are on different levels.

However telling your significant other to shut the fuck up is super disrespectful, you are a 30 year old- learn to convey how you are feeling without resorting to insulting and swearing at someone. Think about how you would feel if a man treated your sister this way in a future relationship. Remember the way she sees you treat women and how you are acting in relationships is what she is growing up and seeing as acceptable for her future relationships. \n\nHowever, I do agree that your girlfriend is a bigger asshole. Her approach was also completely wrong. If she had genuine concerns with the health of your sister she should be able to convey that to you- BUT- that\u2019s not what she did. She was just being a HUGE asshole and criticizing a 12 year old\u2019s body. That is super fucked up. It\u2019s things like this that cause kids to have low self esteem and grow up feeling inadequate their whole lives. I would worry about her saying something similar straight to your sister\u2019s face. Comments like this can be SO HARMFUL to young girls. What she did was disrespectful to your sister and is creating a toxic relationship between the two. I truly don\u2019t blame you for being mad, your sister is lucky to have a brother that cares so much about her. \n\nAlso, if you are concerned from a genuine health aspect for your sister, work with her to develop healthy habits now. I grew up as an overweight kid and then an obese adult. It took a lot of work to reprogram my habits and relationships with food that I learned young. Lead by example- buy healthy foods, make healthy meals for you two, and encourage physical activity. Support her and enable her to be a healthy adult, that\u2019s part of the responsibility of being a parent too. And the focus should be with health being the priority, not what she looks like.",

I do think part time childcare is the least you could do... However, she's really taking advantage and is being an absentee, neglectful parent if she's been gone days on end without prior arrangement. You could offer to pay her rent which she could use towards a babysitter as an alternative... But it sounds like she's not there at all. I recommend involving your father since he is likely unaware that his children have been without a parent for this many days. He's the other parent here, not you, and it should really be between them about arranging their primary care. You can let them both know the hours and times that you can babysit that is a monetary equivalent to your share of household expenses. NTA.",

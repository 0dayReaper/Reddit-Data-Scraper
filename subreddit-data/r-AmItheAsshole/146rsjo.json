Keep in mind that your mother may be struggling to put food on the table if the economy is in the toilet, so she it not AH either.  \n\nThere are low cost and No cost ways of caring for oily skin that might help until you can afford something else.  Here are some suggestions:\n\n* Wash your pillow/pillowcase/bedding regularly.  \n* Drink plenty of water!  This is super important!\n* Sleep on your back\n* Reduce stress\n* Wash your hands often and keep them away from your face.\n* Don't Smoke. \n* Wash Your face with cold or luke-warm water, never hot water\n* Wash Your face towel after every use if possible\n* Get plenty of sleep\n* Stay out of the sun - wear a hat if possible when outside.  \n\nGood luck!",

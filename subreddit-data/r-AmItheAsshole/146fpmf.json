I waited and at the hour he didn't call. I called he didn't respond, I texted him a simple \"hi\" and then I called a second time and still no response, I figure perhaps he was still busy with his chores, one hour later I called him two times more, but he didn't answered but I figured he must have fallen asleep. I went to sleep. Today I woke up, I opened  my messages and the \"hi\" is on read. I really do not think much about it since he probably just woke up and will text me later. The day passes, no calls, no texts. I do not text him bcs at this point I have called him 4 times and texted once so I might be seen as annoying. \nHe calls me at 5 pm, starts talking about a game and I was upset so I was just saying yes and nos, he invites me to play online and I told him that I don't want to play since I have been playing on my own today. (Which was true I didn't say it as a excuse)\nHe asked me \"Is this because I fell asleep yesterday?\" \nAnd I told him \"Not, really that can happen to anyone, but you didn't text me all day\"  he interrupted me and said he was busy working today to which I told him \"yes I understand but still you just called me and instead of asking me how am I, how was my day idk, you just start talking about games and whatever\" \n\nWe started arguing and  he told me he didn't want to talk about it and and I told him then just tell me when it is the right time to tell you this. He said he called me bcs he just wanted to talk to me, not to fight, that I'm being rude and annoying and like yeah okay I understand but I'm telling you I do not like this and you just got all defensive like it doesn't matter. \nHe just told me \"I'll call you later\" and then hung up.\n\nI don't know if I exaggerated, and this is not the first time he does something like this. AITA?\n\nEnglish is not my first language sorry for the typos.",

Or when he called, he could have apologized for falling asleep on you and then started going into the conversation. Basically, he needed to acknowledge he essentially ditched out on something that was planned, whether a good or a bad reason, and then it'd be easier for you guys to move on to normal conversation. But if this is a chronic issue and you've brought it up to him before, chances are, he's not going to change any time soon. Hate to say it. But witnessed it too many times.",

This is not good enough.\"?\n\n&gt; \"yes I understand but still you just called me and instead of asking me how am I, how was my day idk, you just start talking about games and whatever\" \n\nAgain, instead of your valid complaint that he did the wrong thing and then didn't address it, you just communicate neediness instead. You're not entitled to small talk, you are entitled to having agreements kept and being responded to in a reasonable timeframe.",

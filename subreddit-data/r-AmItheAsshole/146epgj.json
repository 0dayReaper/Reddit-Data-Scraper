It does not take years to get a visa to visit - perhaps demonstrating this to her may help her realise your concerns are valid and he\u2019s not being honest. Also, stop minimising her feelings with the \u2018boyfriend\u2019 comments unless you\u2019re actively trying to push her away from you and towards him.",

I say this as someone who has both been in the aforementioned relationship and been a teenage girl. Much luck to you.",

It\u2019s fine to be concerned, so often young girls can be taken advantage of and who knows if the guy is who he says he is not to mention possible issues with their actual relationship, cultural differences etc.\n\nOn the flip side: I\u2019m one of said women who was in an online relationship and I know how it feels for people not to view it as a real relationship. It took 6 years for me to meet my husband IRL, but now we\u2019re happily married. Not all online relationships are shady people. My husband also didn\u2019t like video calls just because he felt they made him look worse compared to IRL; he did do a few with me though. HOWEVER, you never know. Perhaps the solution, rather than a flat out no and consequent alienating her is to allow a meeting on the basis that you go with her and be with her the whole time. Granted if it were me I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to do this but if she truly wants to continue the relationship then so be it. It can be in Bali like suggested. If the guy suddenly pulls out then you know something is up. \n\nAdditionally, ask her what her plans are with this guy. Does she see herself marrying him? If so where will they live. If she wants it to be USA what\u2019s involved in visas? If it\u2019s India, is she really sure she can handle the massive cultural difference/language/being far from family etc. is he on the same page as her? \nAll these questions and more, if framed in a way that shows you\u2019re coming from concern for her well being and not one of patronising her should get her thinking of the serious implications of having a relationship like this. Long distance relationships are no joke and it truly never stops being long distance because you will always have family very far from each other.",

I've watched a couple of my friends go through that dynamic with their parents who were critical and had to \"win\" arguments all the time. It didnt really give them a healthy space to grow and would deliberately hide when they did fail because they didnt want to handle their parents rubbing it in their face. Not saying that's what's happening here at all, but its possibly worth noting.",

Bali is a gift, one you are unlikely to get again.

Before my daughter turned 16 she had a couple crushes that never got as far as kissing, AFAIK. (I could be wrong.) Then, two years ago (when she was 16) she \"met\" an Indian guy (then 19, born, raised, and living in India) via an intellectual email discussion group. (The email group is legit. I joined it 25 years ago.) He became her \"boyfriend.\" At first he didn't want to video chat with her, claiming to be shy, but he eventually relented. Then he hesitated with me also but relented. My wife and I didn't approve for several obvious reasons but figured her interest will wane as she meets local guys. Now, two years later, even though she's cute, in great athletic shape, and has been in community college (a year early) she still hasn't been on a real date with anyone (no dinner, no movie, not even lunch) and the guy in India is still her \"boyfriend.\"\n\nAbout a year ago he had a motorcycle accident, was in a coma for many weeks, and lost a large chunk of his brain and skull. She wanted to go to India to console him or something, and my wife and I of course rejected the proposal.  He seems to have recovered. (I haven't seen him but his emails are coherent and well-written.) I suppose he and she are still video chatting, so she must think he has recovered. He's still her \"boyfriend.\" AFAIK he still doesn't like to share photos with her.\n\n He says it would take a year or two, if even possible, for him to get a visa to come here, so he proposes that they both meet in Bali where my sister lives. Of course my wife and I reject this proposal. It would be grave, very grave, if he's not legit. And even if he's entirely legit, what's the point if he can't come here? Does he expect her to live in India?\n\nI also said she's now 18, an adult, so she can legally do whatever she likes but she doesn't have our blessing, nor our support for a trip.\n\nOf course they're both pissed off at me. Am I the asshole?\n\n(In this post I've suppressed strong opinions to avoid influencing replies.)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There will be plenty of people who can advise you.\n\nI am Indian too, but India may be one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world, almost every state, every region, every ethnicity has different culture and religion, at the same time, the level of conservationism, liberalism and open/close mindedness are very wide too. Many, many cultures and parents practise arranged marriage. Some people like to play around before getting married to their parents' choice, or evem continuing their affair after marriage. I've known of my old classmates who were together for 5+ years having to separate due to them being arranged by their parents to get married within their religion. Aside from this, there are many scammers too, I've been getting spam/scam calls, messages on my phone almost on a daily basis. Your daughter's boyfriend may actually not as bad as any of these, but I think it's concerning about his reluctance for videocalls or his accident.",

I do know that they discussed this relationship at length and I believe the three of them even had a video call. She stopped going to therapy because she said she got all she could from the sessions.",

All the legit concerns you could have for your daughter and make you not an ah are voided because of your sick motivations. \n\nReading you gave me a puke taste in my mouth, hopefully it's still the morning and I can brush my tooth.\n\nPS: Yes, it can take more than one year to get a visa to your country when people aren't born from the good place. Get down your ivory tower.",

And you and your wife are at the very minimum sexist. \n\nI bet you know a lot about men's market in China and women's exigences about men there. Strangely you had no problem then. How come you were the one to visit her in China, and your daughter can't visit someone else in their country? What if that boy was Chinese and living in poverty? \n\nPlus you didn't have internet at the time right? So how exactly did you meet your wife, random trip there? Why was a situation acceptable for you and your wife back then and not for your daughter? \n\nIt's because the problem is not which country visit which.\n\nThe problem is that you are looking for confirmation biais here about your preconception of what genre should bring what on the table, and which countries origin are acceptable for a daughter. \n\n*For which I am sorry you feel offended I gave you none.*",

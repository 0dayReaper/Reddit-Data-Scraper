    "postText": "My husband Dave and I have been together for six years and married for two. Before I continue I will say that Dave has always been a great husband and our problems have been minor. We recently invited another couple (Martin &amp; Lane) to dinner. We met them at a local brewery and hit it off immediately. At first the dinner was going very well and we had a great time. We started discussing our work lives and Martin said that he was finding it difficult to get a job due to his criminal record. He told us that he had a history of small drug charges but has since gotten clean (over six years) and never looked back. I know from my husband that Layne makes an okay amount of money in sales but they struggle to afford essentials like food and Layne\u2019s insulin. I mentioned to Martin that many warehouse jobs often overlook criminal histories and that a warehouse attached to my workplace was hiring. I asked him if he wanted the company\u2019s phone number and he said yes please. He and Layne seemed excited and thanked me but Dave was quiet for the rest of the night and didn\u2019t acknowledge me. After they both left he started scolding me for \u2018interfering\u2019 with Martin and Layne\u2019s lives and accused me of \u2018showing off\u2019 to them. I was shocked because this was not my intention and I only wanted to help Martin. We have never fought over small issues like this before and I am confused about his behavior. But I would never want to embarrass him in front of his friends or be intrusive. I don\u2019t know if what I did was right, so AITA?\n\n(Edit: fake names)",

They opened up to y\u2019all about him having trouble finding work and told you why. You didn\u2019t pry into their lives. And all you did was offer to put him in contact with someone you think could help- that is a very normal human response and anyone else with the same info would have probably done the same thing.",

(Cooking is ordeal because of the fact there is no space to cook and you have to sanitize everything before using it) She regularly neglects her animals, not cleaning after them or their cages for months.\n\nWhen I first moved in I regularly would clean the floors and try to tidy the areas but after receiving notes to not touch her stuff or move ANYTHING, as well as noticing I was the only one attempting to clean, I stopped. It\u2019s important to note here that by moving her belongings I would pick them up off the floor and try to stack them out of the way so furniture was useable, she has the three ottomans/small couches and the space around them so full of miscellaneous items you can not sit down.\n\nThe landlord regularly goes on vacation and will leave lists of chores to be done by the time she gets back, cleaning the floors, sinks, bathtub, bathroom, kitchen, etc. Except she does not want any of her belongings moved. The way the home is hoarded it\u2019s impossible to clean properly without moving things out of the way. I began refusing to do anything on the list because #1 I felt it wasn\u2019t right she leave that for myself and roommate when she is leaving for a vacation. #2 she never bothers to do any of the stuff on the list. #3 it\u2019s not possible to clean without moving her belongings. \n\nShe confronted me after returning from her latest vacation and asked me why I haven\u2019t been \u201chelping around the house\u201d. I explained the 3 reasons I gave above and she told me helping was the least I could do with the rent being so cheap. \n\nAITA for not \u201chelping around the house?\u201d\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

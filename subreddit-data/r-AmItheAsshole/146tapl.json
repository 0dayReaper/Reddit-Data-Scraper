Sometime after your boyfriend leaves you can sit down with this friend and explain to them really how much they hurt you and you're not sure if you can continue the relationship.",

I\u2019m reading a book called Frientimacy by Shasta Nelson that has really helped me start to work through it. It talks about how good friendships are built and how to go about building each one of the 3 pillars of friendship. It may give you some words to explain and clarity on what is going on in your friendship to be able to talk to her about it. Don\u2019t ignore your feelings and act like nothing happened but make sure that you are ready for the conversation and can go into it with love instead of anger.",

But recently, in the last few months or so, it's been radio silence from them. \n\nWhenever I'd try to text them I would just get left on seen, when I have seen them on campus they'd be short with me and barely talk to me at all, they took me off their close friends list and eventually unfollowed me on different forms of social media. \n\nThe thing is, we didn't have any bad blood at all before this, we were just as normal as ever. So them suddenly doing this basically felt like a betrayal.\n\nI was a mess for these few months, I had some other things going on like finals/family situation and was so stressed. But also the added factor of my best friend of nearly a decade ghosting me so suddenly for no good reason just made things so much worse. So many nights I've cried to my myself about this, cried to my boyfriend, and cried to my other friend about this. Like how terrible of a person can I be for my best friend just abandon me like that out of the blue.\n\nAnyways, I've still been civil about it. Every once in a while I'd just text them and ask what's up, why are things like this between us now, and trying my best to not be accusatory towards them at all. These were always left on seen but finally like a week ago they got back to me.\n\nI told them how much I've struggled and their response to this was that they had a mental health episode and that it took them a long time to get back to me. \n\nBut why did they post so many pictures of them and their new friends on campus having fun in those months that they had this episode? Why not go to your best friend, in which I am like a sister to them, when you're feeling down? \n\nSo they asked super last minute to hang out today because they don't want to be alone. I am just coming up with excuses to not go to their place. I mean I'm with my long-distance boyfriend today and it's his last day here. They invited both of us over but I still feel weird about going back to them after with with just an \"I'm sorry\".\n\nI mean a week ago when they finally got back to me I briefly went back to their place and we meshed together pretty well again. In hindsight in's just glad they didn't have me like I convinced myself after these few months of no contact. But I feel funny and bitter about our meeting. I feel weak and walked over for just going back so easily to them with no complaints. I feel differently about it though, like I don't want to go back to them and deserve a better apology.\n\nAITA for avoiding them?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "comment": "ESH\n\nI'm in a very similar situation to both of you. I'm probably more in the camp if your friend. I backed up my friend for a decade and it was never without drama. It got exhausting and when I finally had something which knocked me for six she wasn't there for me and demanded that I be there for her for her newest round of drama. \n\nI didn't want to be an asshole and demean her feelings because I realise that more than one person can be going through something at the same time, so I put some distance out there for my own sake or I'd explode and say something I couldn't take back.\n\nOf course I posted things and appeared normal to the outside because I didn't want others to think that anything was wrong and I'm a private person at the best of times. Social media is just the highlight reel and she was probably just putting out the few moments that didn't suck with people she probably didn't feel like she had to address her problems with. Perhaps with you she would have to stop pretending everything was ok and being pushed to communicate made things harder.\n\nAt the time I knew that yes, it would have been better to communicate my needs and feelings but I was well and truly spent and didn't want to deal with the possibility of an argument.\n\nHopefully this might give you some kind of insight into what may be happening with your friend. Of course it sucks to be ignored but if you can both have a productive conversation where blame isn't thrown around you can probably make it out of this in one piece.\n\nGood luck.",

    "postText": "My mum has three sisters. We were invited to a wedding. I (20f at the time) really wanted to wear a dress but I was extremely hesitant because I hadn't wore one for years. I hated my body back then and I thought every dress looked bad.  \nI found a beautiful red dress and gave it a chance. The saleswomen gave me all sorts of compliments but I was hesitant. But given the enthusiasm and the affordable price I bought it. My aunts were the first to see it and found it nice. I was ecstatic until I tried it in front of mum who said it didn't fit me. I didn't believe her at first. She put me in front of the mirror and shown me where it looked bad. She also took a picture of me wearing it and zoomed on the photo to emphasize her points. By the end I realized the dress was not flattering at all. When my aunts payed a visit she made me wear the dress again and told them how bad it looked. She shown them the photo as well. They said it really wasn't good and they wondered how they didn't notice it at first.\n\n  \nTo say I was disappointed will be an understatement. On top of it my mum kept bringing it up. Every time a photo of a dress would pop up on Facebook she would comment things like \"Look how good that dress fits her, not like the one you bought\", \"Your dress should have been like this in order to look good on you\", \"That dress was made to only fit thin people\" etc. She would also show my the photo she took to point out its flaws.\n\n  \nOne day I had enough and demanded to not talk about it again. Every time she would bring it up I would stop her. Every time she complained because I wasn't letting her express herself and give me advice. One day of me refusing to speak about it again she snapped and ranted about me not being hostile with my aunts for it. She asked why I didn't believe her but immediately believed them when they said the same. She accused me of favouriting them over her because I always listen to them without complaining.\n\n  \nI ended up going shopping with my mum to find a new dres. We eventually found the perfect dress for the wedding. My mum told the saleswoman about the dress situation too. I got annoyed but didn't say anything. Until the day of the wedding she kept accusing me of favouritism. My mum might be a pain in the ass sometimes but I think I was the asshole for forbidding her to express her opinion. She didn't have ill intentions and she was right. I think I made a big deal out of it especially since the dress truly looked bad on me.  \nSo, once again, AITA?",

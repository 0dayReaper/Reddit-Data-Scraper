When the end of my shift came to be I had to make some overtime and by the time i finished I realized i would get only 4 hours of sleep. So i asked my gf if she can cover my shift for me. She replied to me \"do I have a choice?\" with attitude. Then I got mad called her ungrateful and told her i would never cover for her any hours in the future and she should be ashamed ! AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

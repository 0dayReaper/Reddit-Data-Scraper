So a bit loud and sometimes a handful).\n\nMy mum was kinda abusive when I was a kid, not physically but mentally, sometimes she used to hit on the odd occasion, but this was enough to instill fear of her into me.(I'm 32 this year). I'm a big guy, 6'2 300lbs, but she's the only person I remotely fear.\n\nMy mum spoke to my OH a feew days after the invite (my OH helps her friend clean my grandparents house while nan was out, mum was there looking after my grandad who has alzheimers, mum is epileptic herself whos also partially blind) and said 'you (OH) are more than welcome to come but not your kid as I don't want him ruining my birthday', the OH then relayed this to me when I came home from work the same day.\n\nWe (me and the OH) just had an argument about going, I said I'm gonna go alone with mum but the OH thinks I should stick up for myself and the kid I look to as my own and not go out of respect, but she cannot understand the issues it will cause for me and seemingly doesn't care that I have to deal with my mum who I fear about arguing with, she's a great guilt tripper.\n\nAfter this revelation, my OH refuses to ever be civil with my mum again unless absolutely necessary.\n\nEdits: missing info",

If not, you should be at minimum l/c (low contact) by now. \n\nIt's also past time for you to stop letting her guilt trip you. If you can't stand up to it and ignore it, you need therapy to help you see what's going on and how to handle it. You truly need do do this before you lose your gf. You're well beyond the age of being mum's child for her to control at will.\n\nMeanwhile, make mum \"happy\" by skipping her birthday and thereby not ruining it.",

It wasn't until I went low contact that I finally released myself from that fear.  And I realized I kept myself from truly good and serious relationships. Because I never wanted to put any SO up against my mom. Like you, feared my mom.\n\nI was short sighted and hadn't realized that it wasn't about protecting my partners from an abusive woman. It was about loving my partner and our relationship fully - that I'd also stand up for myself in order to nourish that relationship honestly. \n\nAnyway. Long long way for me to say while NAH because I know what it's like to have been there.... don't stay short sighted for too long.  Your OH and your little one deserve all of you. Your fear of mom makes them take second place in your heart because of your fear.",

So this time, I decided to stop at a gas station to get some water but a couple of them on the way were closed so we had to take a small detour (+3 mins) and my wife got upset and called me cheap.

She then narrated the incident to them and called me an AH in private because she made us look \"poor\" in front of our friends. So, AITA?",

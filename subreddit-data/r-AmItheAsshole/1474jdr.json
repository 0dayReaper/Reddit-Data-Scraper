My father and my mother have been divorced for I don't know how many years now, he got remarried to a person who I didn't even know, and I only remember officially meeting her on their wedding day, the woman forced me to wear a dress even though I wanted to wear a pants suit. When I visited my father I thought I would have my own room and get to stay in there all day as that's what I liked to do back then, but no, I had to help the woman's daycare, got grounded for having a rubber band underneath my bed, a room the kids didn't have access to. The two get divorced and then married and divorced, I did say that I would cut him off if he gets remarried to this woman, he did and I kept my promise to cutting him off. \nA few days ago I got an email from him saying that it was my fault for his decision to get remarried to the woman, he was angry at me for blocking him on my phone. \nSo am I the a-hole for this?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "postText": "I'm 23m, my sister is 27f. We have babies 2 weeks apart in age.  My sister is married and is financially stable. I'm a single parent and on a very tight budget since my partner left. My sister has a key to my house since she babysits my daughter for me (paid) two days a week. \n\nMy niece and my daughter use the same kind of formula, but typically my sister brings her own when she's babysitting, which is no big deal. My niece had a doctors appointment today while my sister was babysitting so she dropped my daughter off to our parents for an hour until I got done with work. \n\nI collected my daughter and when I got her home I went to make her a bottle, I noticed there was only one tub of formula when there should have been two. The half used one was still there but the full unopened one was gone. I rang my sister to ask what was up and she said she wouldn't have time to get her own, and she'd just take it off of what I owe her for babysitting. \n\nI told her she needed to bring it back because I can't afford to get anymore, and I could instead give her the nearly used one since the full one would do us until I could get it. She said no, she didn't have time, and it was like this back and forth for a while. I eventually lost my cool, saying she has no idea what my situation is truly like and if she actually gave a shit about my daughter she'd bring it back to me or find a way to get me the money for a new one immediately. I won't lie, I did raise my voice a lot, I was shouting at her. She did end up crying and hung up. \n\nShe later sent a text saying she wouldn't be replacing the formula, nor would she be babysitting my daughter from this point forward because I should know that a grown man shouting at a woman would cause some serious trauma and she no longer feels safe around me. AITA? Did I go too far with my sister?",

OP even offered to give her like a third of his entire supply.\n\nwhat, did she think you were gonna come over and legitimately beat her up over this? bffr. she\u2019s gonna pretend to be afraid of you and play the victim until you concede. my advice is to hold your ground and set a very firm boundary- and you will more than likely have to give her the cold shoulder (you can call it giving her \u201cher space\u201d) until she decides to open the doors of communication again.\n\nas a woman who has a lot of trauma around men for a lot of different reasons, NTA. having trauma over a man doing something to you (which is valid) does NOT absolve you from ever being yelled at again when you do something fucked up.\n\npersonally i would be ending communication with her over this. she\u2019s too old to be acting like this, and at this point i wouldn\u2019t trust her in the slightest if she\u2019s gonna start going nuclear like that over being called out for stealing your baby\u2019s food. your loyalty is to your baby, not those who steal the food from your baby\u2019s mouth.",

Stress that it\u2019s more about how she could have taken that one to tide her over until she could buy more and you\u2019d have been fine with that, but by taking more than she needed your child could go hungry whilst she doesn\u2019t need help to buy more\n\nFrankly, if she was a caring sister she wouldn\u2019t have needed paying to care for her niece anyway. Family helps family. OP was proud enough to pay even though he was struggling financially. I live too far from my sister and her kids, but I know that if any of my uncles had ever asked to be paid to look after their nieces or nephews they wouldn\u2019t be spoken to again outside funerals! (Note: paying for petrol is different - that\u2019s an expense, not a \u2018wage\u2019 for spending time helping with childcare)",

We can\u2019t steal formula from other families. We don\u2019t supply formula at my setting because every baby needs something different. And they were too young to be fed cows milk. So had they left their children with us, they would have starved. And we all knew the situation would only get worse, because now the parents can\u2019t go to work those days, so they\u2019ll have even less money next month. It\u2019s a vicious cycle right now.",

Or your local neighbors or next-door app would be a great place to make a post asking someone in your area if they have formula or if they do babysitting in your price range.

I believe my mother would have been entitled to ~\u00a35 a week for me.\n\nI hope this doesn\u2019t come off as gloating, I wish the USA did better by its constituents.

A person can absolutely be so traumatized by abuse from a man, that just hearing shouting from any man could trigger their PTSD. But that individual would likely need professional help just to be out in the general public. And your sister using gender abuse as an excuse for her laziness and theft is disgusting. She is making life harder for actual victims of domestic abuse. All she had to do is ask you for the formula, but no even that was too much work. And she had the audacity to take the full unopened tub of formula. If she didn't have time to get to the store that day than she would only need a small amount to hold her over. So why the hell did she take the full tub? Even her lame ass excuse doesn't make sense. She is not entitled to your daughter's only source of food. Especially after you told her you couldn't afford to get more. How could anyone be so heartless? All she had to do is apologize and return the formula. If you were my brother OP I would have not only have apologized and returned the formula but would have done something else as a nice I'm sorry gift. If I was your sister I would use my babysitting key to surprise you with more tubs of formula, groceries, a clean house, and a bit of money to help hold you over. But I actually love my brother, unlike your narcissistic sister. Your sister should still go to therapy but focus more on understanding and changing her narcissistic tendencies.

Not only is she completely oblivious to this, she decided that because it was too much effort to go to the store or return the cannister, she was just gonna grab yours without asking for her convenience. If she is financially stable she can pay a little more to have formula delivered and could have ordered some to her house without having to steal yours. Hell, she could ship it directly to you from Amazon, [Walmart.com](https://Walmart.com), or even Instacart without having to go out of her way to return it to you.\n\nYou should not have yelled, but the fear of being unable to feed your child makes it understandable.\n\nNTA",

OR you can get really petty and post it to your socials or a family group chat (say she's not responding to you directly) Personally I'd say don't go super petty.... yet.\n\n\n\"I'm sorry I shouted, but when I saw my baby's only source of food was missing it caused me to panic. I was also shocked that my own sister was the one who took it. I don't feel safe having you around my child any more and I can't trust that this isn't the first, or last, time that you've deprived her of vital care\"\n\n\"I love you and your daughter, if you had told me you were in need I would have been happy to help you (even though things are very rough for me and my daughter right now) but you took without asking, caused me untold amounts of anxiety, and left my daughter without enough food all because you didn't feel like going shopping. This is a massive betrayal of my trust and I simply don't know how long it's going to be before I forgive you. Depriving my child of food is not something I can easily forget\"",

Okay.\n\nThen you plan to go help clean up her house, but because you didn't help earlier, she says no. Okay.\n\nAnd then they ask you to pay for more food and drinks, and when you lightly protest, Jess breaks down and the other mooch tells you to get out?\n\nBuddy, are you a masochist? Cause the only person you're being an AH to is yourself. Also, you need saner and less entitled friends.\n\nNTA",

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo I (20M) hung out with a few of my friends over the weekend (19F, 19F, 22M), and everything was chill until this morning. One of my friends (19F), I\u2019ll call her Jess, was stressed out and trying to clean her house and do her washing as we were there over the weekend and she hadn\u2019t managed to do this beforehand. I offered to help Jess with this but she told me not to do anything, I helped anyway and she seemed a bit better but then started complaining to my other friend (19F) who I\u2019ll call Liv, that I wasn\u2019t helping at all when I should be. Jess then stormed off and sat outside for a while and Liv complained about her to us the whole time. \n\nWe were then going to go and clean up Jess\u2019s Gran\u2019s house for her (all of us) and Jess threw a fit and said she didn\u2019t want me or my other friend (22M) to come with as we didn\u2019t help clean up her house and she was mad at us. We said okay and then they drove us to drop us off at my flat. \n\nLiv then said that they could go get drinks from a drive thru and use my money, and I said cmon man I won\u2019t have any left if you guys keep spending it. My reply was said in a sort of half jokey way, but it was not taken that way. For context, Liv and Jess had been asking me to go to the shop for them and to buy them food and drinks all weekend and I\u2019d been doing it to be nice, even though I would emphasise I didn\u2019t have much money left. However I did also drink some alcohol there (which I chipped in for) and I ate some food there (which I did not pay for, but was offered, however this was not much as most of the food I ate I bought myself), but I felt that I repaid this by buying them things from the shop over the weekend. They also both owe me some money from other times (roughly \u00a3200 between them), but I am okay with this and made it clear I was not upset about this, even though they thought I was. \n\nJess then started crying after I made the comment and Liv then told us to get out the car. Liv then messaged me telling me she doesn\u2019t want to see me or hear from me right now because of the comment I made about the money as it made Jess upset. Jess has also been ignoring me all day because of it. I sent her an apology but she hasn\u2019t opened it yet.\n\nThey are both still talking to my other friend (22M) who was there with us, but are ignoring me. But I somewhat feel like I wasn\u2019t in the wrong to be saying what I said, as I\u2019d been buying them things all weekend and was about to go work for Jess\u2019s gran for free when Jess and Liv were going to be getting paid for it and I wasn\u2019t.\n\nHowever something is telling me I may be being an AH here and I\u2019m just not seeing it, so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

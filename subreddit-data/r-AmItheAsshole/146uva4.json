She is very opinionated and does not like when you go against her in anyway. Over the last couple of years my parents have been fighting and arguing, mainly my mother screaming and telling at my father because he is \"doing nothing\" and \"should do more for the family\". my father works nearly 12 hours a day 5 days a week. My mother on the other hand is a stay at home parent, who does nothing but watch TV half the time, or is just taking one of my sisters to state lawn bowl events, she gets frustrated when things aren't clean but won't clean herself. She'll do everything to take my sister to lawn bowls, she spends time taking her to training, events and other bowls stuff. Everyone else helps cleaning but when we don't do it immediately, she'll yell scream tell everyone to f*** off, say she won't feed anyone till it's done and similar stuff like that. I don't like having to come home, hearing my mum scream and yell and shout. I hate having to come home from work just because I know she'll end up yelling at me like I did something wrong. I will just be sitting and playing games, boom I'm in trouble for not interacting with family, I'm go and spend time with the family, oh why you out here? I have even once been told I'm confused about my sexuality, which by the way was brought up through my brother having a shower some how. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm being an asshole for thinking like this but I can't help but feel like it's a asshole thing to do, \n\nSo WIBTA if I moved out when I turn 18\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Make sure you look after your dad as much as possible though, working as much as he is he's already probably doing as much as he can to avoid her unnecessary drama while still providing for his kids, but that still isn't good for his health, and it's gunna suck if she's the last one left and you have to go through her if you want to spend time with your siblings.",

You will be okay. I had some tough life circumstances and was not able to move out of my toxic and abusive home until I was 21; my mother gave me hell for it and said I'd regret it. I don't regret it. It gave me the breath of fresh air I needed; it literally saved my life. I fully cut ties with her shortly before turning 23. I will be 30 next week. Cutting ties isn't for everyone, so I am not saying you should, as only you know what you need to do in your relationship with her to keep yourself sane. In my experience, people like your mother and mine, remain toxic and do not see a reason to change their ways, not even if it means having a healthy relationship with their children, no matter how old. Whatever you choose to do, do it with confidence and do not let her make you believe you cannot do it on your own. Stay strong.",

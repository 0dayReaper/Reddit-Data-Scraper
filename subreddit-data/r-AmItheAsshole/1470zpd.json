Jade got cut out of the group because she was acting a little too bitchy. We're a group of 'outcasts' (Queer &amp; Neurodivergent), and Jade is close friends with one of her classmates who is pretty bigoted. She's been showing behaviour we didn't really want in our inner circle.\n\nHolly liked Aaron somewhere last year, and she thinks he shouldn't be around Jade anymore, even though they're a perfectly healthy couple from what I can see. \n\nThe situations she gets herself in are usually fights with classmates and Jade. She'll say unnecessarily mean stuff at them and get upset when they call her out for it",

Names changed for privacy.  \nI (16m) am in my second to last year of highschool, The friend group I am in used to consist of myself, Holly (15f), Jade (16f). My best friend from my old school, Nico (16m) joined our school this year. He is in the class with Holly and Jade.   \nWe have since mainly cut out Jade. The other friend group we are in consists of us and Aaron, Anthony, Seb, and Ali. Last year and beginning of this year, we used to have nintendo days with our math teacher. Holly, however, cannot let go of this and is pressuring everyone to keep doing them, except she insists on Jade not being allowed to join.  \nHolly expects the entire group to cut Jade out for her. Jade and Aaron are dating, Holly knows this. Holly is autistic, or at least suspects it. This is important because she revolves everything around the fact that she is autistic. The boys have mostly stopped hanging out with her, and she has texted Nico and I saying \"They cut me out because I'm autistic.\" Which is not the case, because if it was, they would have cut Aaron, Anthony and me out as well.  \nHolly has a habit of viewing everyone as her own personal therapist. In the groupchat between myself, Nico and her, most texts are Holly venting without checking. She eventually vented again and Nico and I were clearly annoyed throughout the entire conversation.  \nI ended up dming Holly telling her we can't be her therapists, nor can we keep answering her at 2 in the morning on a school night whenever shes upset about little things.   \nWe talked back and forth a little and it ended up with her venting about being asked not to vent. I at the time was on the phone with my boyfriend and he suggested I mute her until it all calmed down. I did, and we continued to watch whatever we were watching at the time.  \nA couple hours later, Holly texted the groupchat. Nico and I didn't answer in the groupchat. Holly was saying we need to understand that she is \"more not okay than most people\" and that she doesnt vent with anyone else.   \nI saw Nico at school the next day, Holly wasn't present that day. We talked about it a little and he told me Holly dmed him after she sent that message. The basic gist of what she sent him was her telling Nico it was his fault she was upset right now. Today, Holly texted me again. She was venting and I ignored her texts in favor of calling my closer online friend, Hound. Once she had burnt herself out I told her I wasn't going to help her, just like I had warned her of days ago, and that we don't care if she's upset anymore. She gets herself into these situations knowing full well what'll happen, and I'm tired of it. I'm waiting for the day the school year ends so I don't have to talk to her again.  \nI'm thinking over it too much and maybe I was a little harsh, but this has been going on for months, if not since the start of the friendship.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

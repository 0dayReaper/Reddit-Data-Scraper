Please view our [voting guide here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what.2019s_with_these_acronyms.3F_what_do_they_mean.3F), and remember to use **only one** judgement in your comment.\n\nOP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:\n\n &gt; (1) I dress in a way that a lot of people would consider \u201cslutty\u201d, even around my roommate after his girlfriend asked me not to. (2) It might make me the asshole because his gf perceives it as disrespectful to their relationship and has asked me to dress differently.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My brother is gay, but seeing his family member dressed in scanty clothes made him grossed out. I respectfully took his emotions into account. Especially if I'm entering the communal spaces. \n\nIt's exactly as you stated. Living with roommates is about compromising. She should just ask if he's ok and tell him about the remarks. Totally different if your in your own home.",

He should have let you know, and you won't do it anymore out of respect. You will not, however, change how you dress, ever, anywhere and that her insecurities are not yours to maintain. \n\nAlso, you will not have a bunch of people in your home that will act as \"mean girls\" towards you, so maybe parties for the moment are a no-go.\n\nThis is his issue to deal with even though he may be unaware of it. She should have talked to him first, and if she didn't, that is not your issue. He is the one you have a lease with, not her. She is also not a friend of yours. I'm not sure how you label your relationship with your roommate, but that is who you have to deal with, not her, so put it on his plate and let him deal with it.",

We didn\u2019t know each other when we moved in, but we were introduced by a mutual friend and he\u2019s been the best roommate I\u2019ve ever had and we\u2019ve also become good friends. \n\nA couple months ago, David started dating Brianna and bringing her around our place. Mostly they hang out in David\u2019s room, but I\u2019ve always been friendly with Brianna when she\u2019s over, though I\u2019ve always felt that she\u2019s a little icy towards me. \n\nA few weeks ago though she pulled me aside while David was outside and asked me if I could be more \u201cchill\u201d. I was a little taken aback and told her i didn\u2019t know what she meant, and she told me that I was being a pick me by dressing \u201cslutty\u201d around David - which is honestly kind of fair, I wear a lot of tank tops/crop tops that are on the more revealing side and I like to do my makeup. She also said that she thought it was disrespectful that I cook for him sometimes because he\u2019s \u201cnot my man\u201d. I told her that I had no intention of trying to steal her man or of inserting myself into their relationship, I just dress the way I like to dress and I like cooking for my friends. \n\nI thought that was the end of it, but last night we had a small party at our place and I saw Brianna and two of her friends I hadn\u2019t met before talking while they looked at me. I didnt hear the full context but I distinctly heard one of them say \u201cI see what you mean\u201d in a kind of sneering tone as I passed by, and it almost sounded like she wanted me to hear it. Since then I\u2019ve been feeling really self-conscious and I\u2019m worried that maybe I should change the way I dress. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don't suspect the way you dress is an issue for him because he would have probably brought it up on his own if that was the case, but i could be wrong.\n\nI know there are a lot of people saying that how you dress doesn't matter and to a certain point i agree, what you wear SHOULDN'T impact others but people are emotional as made clear by his girlfriend.\n\nThe only example i have was my female roommate some years back walked into the kitchen in her underwear and tank top for the first time to my knowledge. I was at the dinner table with my girlfriend and this led to a big fight. RM said she didn't see it as an issue as she did this when she was at her own home growing up, which i found hard to believe, then proceeded to shame my girlfriend of being a prude and said that typically line \"women should support woman regardless of their actions\" which didn't go over with my traditional girlfriend and personally i was offended by the conducts. I moved out the same day and moved in with my friend some 10 minutes away.\n\nMy situation was different from yours but i hope this does offer up maybe a different perspective as to whats going on?\n\nWith all this being said if you and David are good friends and this relationship is older than a few months he knows already if he wants to stay with her or leave. You talking to him might help him decide this relationship isnt right for him as it sounds like his girlfriend is insecure, controlling and possibly manipulative. If thats the case he might see it but thinks its just his bias and its not actually whats going on, but with you speaking up he might see the toxic behavior and move on to a better relationship. \n\nYou seem like a good person and honestly i have respect for you and the stand you have made. Don't back down. I hope everything gets better for you and this issue gets resolved quickly. Good luck!",

It is his responsibility to make sure she is not treating you like shit. I would talk to him that you don't like what she is saying to you. He can address his gf about it.",

You can change everything about yourself but you will always be TA in her eyes because she\u2019s insecure about her bf living with you and spending time with you without her there to chaperone. Don\u2019t adopt someone else\u2019s problems as your own; life will present you with enough problems that will legitimately be yours, you don\u2019t need any extras.",

Your girlfriend is mildly embarrassed and will now avoid the mirror when nekkid. Problem solved like a grown up.\n\nGet blinds for your own window. Stay in your lane. YTA.",

He took a minor urban neighbor mishap and turned it into a crime against his honor. He seems to be a black and white thinker who places his own ego in the center of your life together. Are you sure you want to live like this? \n\nGive this a read and make sure nothing rings any bells. https://www.thehotline.org/resources/types-of-abuse/",

In no way was is that amount of effort just an individual, one-off accident. That\u2019s creepy behavior. \n\nON THE OTHER HAND, your reasoning behind wanting to talk to your neighbor is equally bullshit. You aren\u2019t the one who was disrespected, your girlfriend isn\u2019t simply \u201cyour girlfriend\u201d, she\u2019s a person who deserves not to be practically peeped on.

The more you act like you\u2019re insecure the more likely she is to leave you for them which presumably may be your fear here and why you feel the need to make some sort of stand up to someone just for looking out their window and seeing something nice. \n\nAlso you said you asked your gf to close the curtains before. Did you tell her why or just say please close the curtains when you\u2019re in here undressed. I\u2019m a why person myself and don\u2019t just do stuff others say without explanation.

You have no right at all to dictate how he uses his home.  None.  You are the disrespectful one.  You are in the moral wrong.\n\nThe responsibility for this is on you and your gf.  You don't want to be seen by other people who are not on your property, then you are required to take reasonable actions to make that happen.\n\nFrankly, \"going over to have a conversation\" sounds a lot like you intend to be threatening.  Even if you don't intend that, it can easily go downhill if this guy laughs in your face and tells you to fuck off. And you would be on his property and you would be at risk of having the cops called on you.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo I (25M) and my long term, monogamous girlfriend (24F) live together. Across from our flat, we have neighbours, who are able to see into our bedroom by looking through our window and into a tall vertical mirror placed on the wall directly opposite their place. Today, I walked into our bedroom to see my girlfriend naked on our bed, airing herself out as is her wont. She had the curtains open as she was doing so, which I have expressed to her I am uncomfortable with her doing multiple times in the past, for the very following reason.\n\n\r  \nWhen I walked into our bedroom, I could see her lying in a position which meant that she was exposing herself to the neighbours' view through the mirror behind her, and sure enough when I looked over at the neighbours' place, one of them was practically hanging out the window staring into our bedroom. He awkwardly turned away when he saw that I saw him looking.\n\n\r  \nThis has resulted in an argument between myself and my girlfriend. I want to go over and non-aggressively have a few words with the guy and ask for an apology, however my girlfriend is staunchly against this, becoming very upset at even the suggestion of me doing so, and threatening to leave me if I do. We talked for about an hour about it, with me trying to explain to her the concept of masculinity and why I want to confront him over it. She fundamentally disagrees that the traditional sense of masculinity should be an influencing factor in my decisions, but I obviously want to do something about it, even just for myself. \n\n\r  \nThis could make me seem like the asshole because I'm choosing my own feelings over hers, but I feel that I fulfilled my \"reasonable obligations\", shall we say, as a partner by spending so long trying to communicate with her about it, and that she is being unreasonable for refusing to see my side or compromise in any way.\r  \n\n\nSo,\n\n\r  \nAITA if I talk to the dude about it despite my girlfriend's beliefs/wishes?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But you have a right to tell her you don't feel comfortable with her decision to purposelly show herself naked to others. It is about dedication. She may state she's monogamoys and not cheating, and truly believe she's in right, but presenting herself nude to others is absolutely stretching the limits.\nThis can be something that ends a relationship.\nNTA.",

Is that worth disappointing your gf, who might ironically feel more disrespected by you than by your neighbour?\n\nClearly, you are protective of your gf, and that is your natural instinct as her bf. It is understandable. I think had your neighbour used devious methods to spy on your gf, or if your gf wanted you to, confronting him would be the reasonable thing to do. But for this current incident, your curtains weren't closed, and the neighbour was just looking out his window. It doesn't excuse what he's done, but it also drastically reduced his culpability.\n\nLastly, don't make this about you. If there's any 'victim' here, it's your gf. Help her feel better. Take action to prevent this from happening again. But don't make her feel worse by doing something that helps you feel better at her expense.",

A decent neighbour would have looked, noticed a naked form, maybe stared abit if stunned, then looked away, and if wanting to be neighbourly, drop a text or walk over and say, \"hey you're exposing yourself, please close your curtains\" or something to that effect. This neighbour was allegedly hanging out the window with those popping out wolf eyes. \n\nGF is kinda sus. Maybe she really didn't notice, maybe she didn't think, maybe it was a honest mistake, maybe she has voyeuristic tendencies, maybe maybe maybe... Down to whether BF trusts her and how she behaves from here on about the window/mirror, though it seems BF has removed said mirror.\n\nBF, your thought process is complete AH mentality. What in the cat's poop is \"THE CONCEPT OF MASCULINITY\". Sounds like something one of those men (buff and constantly flexing) in podcasts would say when dropping other terms/phrases like \"Alpha\" and \"no one messes with me\". Also when someone says, I plan on being non aggressive, kinda reeks of, buttttt I miggghhht become aggressive anywayyyyyyy.\n\nI vote ESH.",

What he did was criminal leering like that IF she wasnt secretly doing on purpose.... that being said you can get a film at most hardware stores, or online, that you put on your window. It will make the outside mirror-like but still can look outside (its meant to help birds not hit windows i think). Its a nice middle ground.",

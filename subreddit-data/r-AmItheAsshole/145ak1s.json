    "postText": "I (18) was in my sister's room looking for some art supplies I needed for a project. I really shouldn't have been in there looking in the first place because she (21) is away right now at school, but my mom said it was fine for me to look because she knew that I would respect her belongings and not snoop around. \n\nI went into her room and saw a spool of string that was hanging out of one of her dresser drawers, and I vaguely remembered that she used to keep some craft supplies in one of her dresser drawers. Thinking that the supplies would be in whichever drawer this escaped spool of string was leading to, I followed the string and opened the drawer. But instead of finding craft supplies, I found wrappers and packages of snacks, candies, and other foods packed into the drawer so tight it was like a brick. Over the past year, my family noticed that my sister had gained some weight, but we never brought it up since we all know she is on medication that is associated with weight gain. We also noticed food \"going missing\" often, too, which we did bring up since entire packages and bags of food would \"disappear\" right after we bought it. She would always vehemently deny that she had eaten or taken any of the food and this would often lead to her fighting with me or my parents because even though we didn't have proof, we knew that she had to be the one taking the food. \n\nI'm not sure why, but for some reason, finding the packed drawer of wrappers is really bothering me, and I want to tell someone. My goal is not at all to get my sister in trouble or to start a fight, but I know that will inevitably happen if I bring this up. If I do tell someone, I want to tell only my mom since she is a lot more level-headed than my father, and I also think she will be more understanding that although what is going on isn't good, my sister obviously is losing some self-control. However, my mom has been getting very angry about this food situation since she knows that my sister has been lying to her face for months on end. I want to do my best to not get my dad involved since I'm sure that he will be super angry. He and my sister already don't get along and I don't want this to be a breaking point. \n\nI also understand, though, that I shouldn't have been in her room in the first place, and that me being there looking though her drawers in the first place is an invasion of privacy. As I said before, she is also 21, meaning that she is old enough to be responsible for her own actions and should deal with situations like this herself. But this is also a very unhealthy habit and is also very unclean since I'm sure there must be crumbs or residue in that drawer. \n\nWIBTA for bringing up my findings with my mom?\n\n\nEDIT: Now that I have read some replies, I've realized that it was immature of me to think I should bring my parents into this, since I am old enough to talk with her and because they haven't been supportive in the past. I'm planning on messaging her. This is what I plan on sending her (something like this). Do you think this is to aggressive? I want to be 100% supportive, honest, and open. \n\nMessage: \n\nI'm telling you this because I think I owe it to you to be honest &amp; truthful.\n\nI went in your room because I was looking for string for a painting I was doing. I stood in the doorway and looked around to see if there was any on your desk, and then I saw a spool that had rolled out on the floor from one of your dresser drawers. I thought that there would be more string in the drawer, so I opened it. I know that I shouldn't have because I didn't ask you, but I did, because I told myself I wasn't going to snoop around. When I opened the drawer though there was a lot of old food wrappers. I didn't touch anything and I didn't tell anyone and I'm not planning on telling anyone. I don't want to overstep but I think if you feel like you constantly need to snack that much that it might be a problem. I don't want to make you feel ashamed because I know that mom &amp; dad are usually on you for eating/or you \"taking\" food, and that I have said things like that too in the past. I don't want to make you feel ashamed and I don't think mom or dad wants you to either, I think they are just concerned and I am too. whether it's medication, coping over something, or NOT overeating and just not being comfortable eating in front of people, I think you should maybe talk to someone about it, even if it's not mom or dad. I'm not implying that something is \"wrong,\" I'm just concerned that maybe something is based on the limited information I have. I wokt bring anything up to anyone either way. I do think that you should work to clean out the drawer though for cleanliness reasons since it's getting warm, and so that it's not constantly there and maybe reminding you of something. I don't want to overstep my boundaries even though I know I already did by going into your room without your permission. I'm sorry I did that, I haven't done it ever before and I won't do it again. I'm only bringing this up because I want to help and not to make you ashamed.",

This is a ridiculous projection of your own relationship with food onto your sister. This is major AH behavior. Just because you struggled with disordered eating doesn\u2019t mean everyone else does. What she\u2019s dealing with is probably related to a medication side effect, most likely not an eating disorder, and that can be resolved by switching meds, but if the weight gain is not affecting her physical or mental health, she doesn\u2019t have an issue with the side effects, and the med is working for her, then there\u2019s no issue.",

And for some things, there isn't a different medication that can be used that doesn't have those effects. Case in point: Prednisone (a steroid).\n\nI have an autoimmune disease that is destroying my joints (among other things. My immune system has already tried to kill me once). When I have a \"flare\", which is when disease activity drastically increases, I have to take a 2 week course of Prednisone. That's it. That's the treatment. Only other option would be steroid injections which would have the exact same effect in regards to appetite.\n\nEVERY time I take Prednisone, my appetite is out of control and I can't stop eating. I can eat an entire HUGE plate of pasta and ten minutes after finishing, feel like I haven't eaten all day. I know I just ate a huge meal and my body doesn't need any more. I've already gone way over the calories for the day.\n\nSo I try and hold out as long as possible. But eventually I get to the point where I am dry heaving and HAVE to eat something. Trust me, I HATE it. I don't want to be eating that much food. But it's the only way to treat a flare. I'm lucky though. I only have to take Prednisone periodically.\n\nA lot of people have to take it daily to manage the disease. And pretty much all gain a lot of weight and can't lose it. I may get to the point where I have to take Prednisone daily as well. I think it's probably pretty likely. Our doctors know we eat nonstop, gain a ton of weight, mood swings and \"roid rag. But it's considered the lesser evil than letting the disease do it's thing.",

I know I had to because I couldn\u2019t manage symptoms with therapy. If she feels it\u2019s affecting her negatively, there may be other options that she can talk to her doctor about, it depends on the medication and what it\u2019s treating. I\u2019ve been on antipsychotics for half my life, any med in that class increases my appetite no matter the dosage, however reactions to meds are different for everyone. I basically just said if she\u2019s not having any issues with it and it\u2019s not affecting her health, there\u2019s probably not a problem. I didn\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t an issue if it was affecting her health. Also, checking up on her and asking her if she was having any issues wouldn\u2019t be problematic, but what you asked about would be. It\u2019s her life, not yours, not your mothers. Not everyone has to be skinny.\n\nEdit for clarification",

Hiding food wrappers could be a sign that she in feeling shame toward taking and eating the food. Things such as stress, anxiety, depression, the onset of an eating disorder, etc. can all trigger this type of behavior. There is most likely a lot more going on with your sister and this behavior is just a byproduct of what she is experiencing.\n\nI understand your concern and your desire to tell your mother, but if I were in your position, I would actually talk to your sister first. It is going to be a sensitive topic and she most likely won\u2019t react well when you bring it up, especially because of the previous issues surrounding the food going \u201cmissing\u201d. But if you are able to act with compassion and explain that you haven\u2019t told your parents, she may be a little more keen to open up to you about what\u2019s really going on. On the other hand, if you really feel that you cannot keep your cool, I would tell your mother. To me, it is obvious she is struggling with SOMETHING and using this as a potential coping mechanism. Speaking to her (whether that\u2019s you or your mom) with kindness and a willingness to listen to her is so important. If she feels attacked about this, things will only get worse. \n\nIt\u2019s not about the food, there is more going on here.",

I'm planning on messaging her. This is what I plan on sending her (something like this). Do you think this is to aggressive? I want to be 100% supportive, honest, and open.**\n\nMessage:  \nI'm telling you this because I think I owe it to you to be honest &amp; truthful.  \nI went in your room because I was looking for string for a painting I was doing. I stood in the doorway and looked around to see if there was any on your desk, and then I saw a spool that had rolled out on the floor from one of your dresser drawers. I thought that there would be more string in the drawer, so I opened it. I know that I shouldn't have because I didn't ask you, but I did, because I told myself I wasn't going to snoop around. When I opened the drawer though there was a lot of old food wrappers. I didn't touch anything and I didn't tell anyone and I'm not planning on telling anyone. I don't want to overstep but I think if you feel like you constantly need to snack that much that it might be a problem. I don't want to make you feel ashamed because I know that mom &amp; dad are usually on you for eating/or you \"taking\" food, and that I have said things like that too in the past. I don't want to make you feel ashamed and I don't think mom or dad wants you to either, I think they are just concerned and I am too. whether it's medication, coping over something, or NOT overeating and just not being comfortable eating in front of people, I think you should maybe talk to someone about it, even if it's not mom or dad. I'm not implying that something is \"wrong,\" I'm just concerned that maybe something is based on the limited information I have. I wokt bring anything up to anyone either way. I do think that you should work to clean out the drawer though for cleanliness reasons since it's getting warm, and so that it's not constantly there and maybe reminding you of something. I don't want to overstep my boundaries even though I know I already did by going into your room without your permission. I'm sorry I did that, I haven't done it ever before and I won't do it again. I'm only bringing this up because I want to help and not to make you ashamed.",

I think bringing it up so much and saying you won\u2019t tell anyone highlights that you absolutely believe it\u2019s a huge problem. I don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t mention her medication at all. If you don\u2019t ever send her messages that long, she will immediately know something is up. I also am confused why you aren\u2019t having this conversation in person. If it is a big deal like you think, discussing it in person makes the most sense. You can get clues from her reactions, and it\u2019ll avoid so many of the misinterpretations that happen when people discuss something serious over text. Not to be rude and I believe you\u2019re trying to help, but I also don\u2019t know if you\u2019re a reliable narrator. If you\u2019ve had problems with disordered eating, you could be projecting. You\u2019ve said your parents are angry about it and likely to react with anger if they find the drawer. You\u2019ve said your mom is judgmental but claims it\u2019s because she\u2019s trying to help. This could easily be a situation where your parents led you to an eating disorder, and now they\u2019re leading your sister to one, too. It\u2019s not helpful at all to make someone with an eating disorder feel like shit for eating. It\u2019s not helpful to offer unsolicited advice, especially while someone is eating or about to eat. Has your mom always been judgmental over eating? What does your sister\u2019s doctor say? Is she gaining weight at an unhealthy rate or is her weight a significant health risk that outweighs whatever she needs the medication for? She could be struggling with food, but she could also just have to hide snacks from her insanely overbearing and judgmental family. I\u2019ve hidden snacks from my judgmental mother as have my siblings. My mom just doesn\u2019t understand that everyone has different caloric needs based on gender, age, weight, metabolism, activity level, etc. I feel like a simple text where you tell her you\u2019re bringing it up to help her would be better than a long drawn out text if you arent willing to discuss it face to face. For example: \u201cI know I should have asked you directly, but mom said I could go in your room to find string for a painting I\u2019m working on, and I opened your (description of where drawer is, such as top left dresser drawer, instead of what\u2019s inside). I don\u2019t want mom and dad to find it after how insane they\u2019ve been about the snacks. Do you want me to throw it away while they\u2019re gone?\u201d Establish yourself as her ally, and build up to expressing your concern once you gauge her reaction and willingness to discuss it. I\u2019d also be careful about making promises to keep it a secret. If it is actually a problem, you don\u2019t want to lose her trust by breaking your promise.",

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (18) was in my sister's room looking for some art supplies I needed for a project. I really shouldn't have been in there looking in the first place because she (21) is away right now at school, but my mom said it was fine for me to look because she knew that I would respect her belongings and not snoop around. \n\nI went into her room and saw a spool of string that was hanging out of one of her dresser drawers, and I vaguely remembered that she used to keep some craft supplies in one of her dresser drawers. Thinking that the supplies would be in whichever drawer this escaped spool of string was leading to, I followed the string and opened the drawer. But instead of finding craft supplies, I found wrappers and packages of snacks, candies, and other foods packed into the drawer so tight it was like a brick. Over the past year, my family noticed that my sister had gained some weight, but we never brought it up since we all know she is on medication that is associated with weight gain. We also noticed food \"going missing\" often, too, which we did bring up since entire packages and bags of food would \"disappear\" right after we bought it. She would always vehemently deny that she had eaten or taken any of the food and this would often lead to her fighting with me or my parents because even though we didn't have proof, we knew that she had to be the one taking the food. \n\nI'm not sure why, but for some reason, finding the packed drawer of wrappers is really bothering me, and I want to tell someone. My goal is not at all to get my sister in trouble or to start a fight, but I know that will inevitably happen if I bring this up. If I do tell someone, I want to tell only my mom since she is a lot more level-headed than my father, and I also think she will be more understanding that although what is going on isn't good, my sister obviously is losing some self-control. However, my mom has been getting very angry about this food situation since she knows that my sister has been lying to her face for months on end. I want to do my best to not get my dad involved since I'm sure that he will be super angry. He and my sister already don't get along and I don't want this to be a breaking point. \n\nI also understand, though, that I shouldn't have been in her room in the first place, and that me being there looking though her drawers in the first place is an invasion of privacy. As I said before, she is also 21, meaning that she is old enough to be responsible for her own actions and should deal with situations like this herself. But this is also a very unhealthy habit and is also very unclean since I'm sure there must be crumbs or residue in that drawer. \n\nWIBTA for bringing up my findings with my mom?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

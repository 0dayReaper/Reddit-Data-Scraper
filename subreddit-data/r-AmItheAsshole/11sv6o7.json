    "postText": "My great-aunt set up savings accounts for all of her female relatives. In our culture education for women is not really valued and she thought that was bullshit. \n\nShe lived with her father in London where she was educated. She went on to attend university and became a doctor  She married a British man, they moved to America and had a great life. She funded the education of as many of her neices and grand neices as she could. \n\nWhen she passed away she left money for every girl relative she could. \n\nMy parents managed to access the accounts that were set up for my sister and I. They used it to pay for my brother's wedding. My sister didn't care because she got married two years out of high school and had no intention of going to college. \n\nWhen I graduated I went to the bank to get money for school and it was almost all gone.  There was like $13,000 left. \n\nI asked my parents about it and they said they had needed the money. I finally found out where the money went. I got furious. I got student loans and moved out. I am a great source of shame to them and I don't give two fucks. \n\nI am currently suing them for the money that was left for me. My entire family is against me. They all think I am a complete asshole for airing private family business in public. And that I am putting money ahead of family. My friends are all on my side but they are all Americans and don't really get my culture.  Neither do I to be honest. \n\nMy brother called me up and offered to pay for my university if I drop the lawsuit. I agreed as long as we had a legally binding contract. He said I was being an asshole for not trusting him. I said he should not have accepted my money for his wedding. It is causing all kinds of embarrassment in our community.  \n\nI am somewhat ashamed to be doing this but I don't want to have this debt I should not have.",

Your brother is also the AH for trying to get you to drop a lawsuit with what is most likely a lie. If you have a chance to start life without student debt you do whatever you can to do that. Your parents \n, and I'm sorry but their culture, sound completely toxic. I'm glad you got out.",

People often go above and beyond their means for their kids\u2019 weddings because it\u2019s a way to show off your wealth and your connections, hence the elaborate events held for often over hundreds of people, the majority of whom the people being married do not know personally/have never met. Heck, I\u2019ve been forced to go to the weddings of people I never knew I was related to in any way. \n\nI can definitely see people like that justifying paying for a few hours of a marriage party over an education. Though OP\u2019s parents take it a step further by committing grand larceny, which is a new one even for me. What a world.",

    "postText": "First post on a new account because I deleted my old one a while ago for mental health reasons.   \n\n\nI have been giving my friend, we'll call her Zoe, free tutoring in any subject for the past two years now. I usually get very high grades and I've never failed a test or a quiz. English is Zoe's second language, so she needs a bit of extra help with things being explained to her, and it needs to be in fairly simple terms. This is not an issue for me as I can simply reword questions and break down what all of something means, define words, etc. The only thing is that I have a lot of personal responsibilities at home and outside of school in addition to having mental health issues and a strained relationship with my parents which essentially makes it so the sooner I'm not financially dependent on them, the better.  The other day I was tutoring her again because we have our finals coming up and I brought up that while I wouldn't be charging her for this session or anything before next schoolyear, she'd have to pay me if she wanted me to tutor her next schoolyear. She at first thought I was joking, but when she realized I was serious she got defensive, and claimed she shouldn't have to because she was my friend. I explained my reasonings to her, and also added that most tutors are very expensive, and that I was willing to lower my price from $20 to $10 for her. She said she wasn't sure if her parents would let her, so I said I'd go to $5, but nothing lower. She said she'd talk it over with her parents, but she might not be able to, and was definitely upset. I know she needs the help, and that other tutors haven't worked out well for her in the past, which is why I'm not sure if I should've just agreed to tutor her for free/ if I'm being an asshole here.",

It's not at all unreasonable for you to want to be paid for your work in future.\n\nDon't keep talking your price down just because she keep coming up with excuses for not wanting to pay you for your work. She's taking advantage of your generosity and people will try to do the same throughout your life. Better to learn to stand up to that now than to wait until later. That $20 is presumably not only for the direct tutoring time but also preparation and marking, it could quickly become less than minimum wage.\n\nCould Zoe perhaps get a job? That's usually how things work: if you want something that costs money then you have to work to earn enough money to buy it.",

To me the key word here is \"friend\", you were not tutoring but helping a friend.  So the past 2 years is just that, now going forward, you have your business.\n\nYou are looking to start up tutoring, that is admirable and good for you.  You have selected a rate of pay, then offered reduced to Zoe then reduced it again, good for you but a poor business model.  I would stick with the reduced rate of $10 and not go lower than that.  Also, AGAIN, admirable that you let her know you would not be charging for remainder of the year and this would start for NEXT school year.\n\nI ask for some INFO\n\n* How old, what grade is Zoe?\n* How long is this looking to last?\n* Would you consider a barter/trade instead of money (redditors please dont let your mind go directly to the gutter on this)\n\nYou sound like this is a real passion for you and you dont find that often today.

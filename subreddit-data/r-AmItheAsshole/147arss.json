There has been previous drama between us with driving. He doesnt like the way i drive and i also get annoyed with how he drives. We both will drive each others cars depending on where we are going or due to weather (his car is awd mine fwd). Before, there has not been incidents with him hitting things with either until recently. Last year he hit a deer with my car on his way home from work (normally he drive his car but I cant remember his reasoning for why he didnt). I was just happy he was ok and told him it wssnt his fault, these things happen. I only had to pay for my deductible but since then i havent really liked the way my car drives but I just deal because its fine, nothing is wrong with it, and cars are expensive. Flash to now, last night he hit a raccoon and while the damage to my car isnt excessive there is still more damage than i would expect from a raccoon. He felt bad when he saw the damages and i tried to reassure him that there was nothing he could have done. My car is from 2017, so I was hoping to drive it till it died but with all these annoyances I almost want to get a new car. So would i be the ah if I got a new car and asked him not to drive it?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Do you just want to savour the new shiny thing yourself for a bit?  What is your motivation?\n\nI don't think there is anything wrong with it at all.  I'm just concerned your guy might perceive it as a 'punishment'.",

    "postText": "\nI f32 recently inherited a good amount of money from my mom. I keep the money in a seperate account as I still haven't decided what to do with it and I didn't want it to go to waste.\n\n\nI noticed my husband constantly bringing up the inheritance money and making countless suggestions as to how I should spend it. Another thing is that he expects me pay for nearly everything the past couple of weeks.\n\n\nFor NYE, My husband and I met up with his family at a restaurant to celebrate. It was going fine until I found out that I was expected to pay for everyone at the table. My husband's mom joked about paying for dinner out of my \" inheritance pocket\" which made me livid but I showed no reaction. Just silently paid for my own food/drinks. Then got up and made my way out of the restaurant. They were shouting after me like a crowd and my husband tried to get me to come back but I drove home.\n\n\nHe got back at 3 a.m yeling at me saying I was pathetic to get up and walk out on him and his family after they *relied* on me to pay for their food and thougt I was gracious enough to do it BUT they were wrong. He said I humiliated him and family and that what I did was an attempt to get back at them for not being able to help mom when she was sick. Not true is all I'm gonna say.\n\n\nHe is mad and is saying that I caused a huge rift between his family and me when it wouldn't have hurt me to pay for the celebratory dinner.\n\n\nAITA?",

I got up and silently walked out after being asked to pay for dinner for my inlaws.\n\n\n(2). I might be the ahole for only paying for myself and walking out and putting my inlaws on the spot when I had the means to pay for their meals.

Instead of suggesting they spend the money on buying a house or rental property or put away for retirement he wants her to blow the money away ever since she got it.\n\nGood for her keeping it separate talk to a financial advisor and maybe a divorce or probate attorney so that the inheritance is properly kept as a separate asset and not commingled into marital property.",

My husband said what do you want to do with it? He knew I needed a new car we were saving for a home we needed a new bed etc, none of it was suggested or said or mentioned at any stage. It was my choice and my money. In the end dad helped with our down payment on our first home and got me a new car cause mine was shit and the aircon kept crapping out, not fun in Australian summer. We also got a puppy. Dad would have approved all three of these, especially the puppy. He preferred dogs to people. The morning we moved in to the home he helped us with the deposit for a pair of king parrots came for breakfast. I always heard when you see or find feathers the dead are looking out for you, well he sent me two whole damn birds to say good job, at least in my mind anyway.",

This more points to OP's husband being threatened by her having her own money, so he wants to spend it ASAP - ideally on him - so he can exert financial control over OP.  OP said in another post that her husband has been exhibiting other controlling behaviors outside of the inheritance issue so it's very concerning.  Divorce really is the best solution here.",

She also left me a considerable amount of cash. I know in my heart my mom was comforted knowing she didn't have to worry about what would happen to me when she was gone.\n\nOne of my crass relatives (her niece) commented on what she had left me. My response: I'd rather have my mother back and be living in a cardboard box on the street.",

That is weird, unless you have discussed it with either hubby or in-laws, which it doesn't sound like you did. The family was wrong to place blame on anyone other than the people who felt entitled to your inheritance.  Maybe take a little bit of your money and spend a weekend alone in a nice hotel near the beach, lake, mountains, wherever you feel comfortable and do some soul searching.  I personally would not want to continue associating with people who feel entitled and then blame you for their own erroneous expectations. But, that is just me. Also, read this free ebook, you may be surprised by what you learn. \n\nhttps://archive.org/download/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat/Lundy_Why-does-he-do-that.pdf",

The fact your own husband was upset that you didn\u2019t pay for his family is disgusting. \u201cHe said I humiliated him and family and that what I did was an attempt to get back at them for not being able to help mom when she was sick.\u201d There are so many red flags here and I think you made the right call in only paying for yourself. Be sure the account you are currently keeping the money in is solely under your name and NEVER let your husband or his family have access to it.",

Yet after her passing when you have a large sum of money, you should be gracious &amp; share with your family. That\u2019s manipulative and beyond selfish. \n\nYour husband shouldn\u2019t even ask you to do that, let alone tell his family beforehand &amp; encourage them to pressure you. \n\nGet out, get out fast",

The breakup was 2 1/2 weeks ago and she knows I hate him so why is she complaining to me? She has refused to respond and all my friends have stopped texting me. AITA?",

It's easy to tell her to get over it, but you don't know what it's like unless you've been there yourself. When you're going through it, that's when you need someone to be there for you until you can recover from the pain. You weren't being a friend. Why should she respond to you?",

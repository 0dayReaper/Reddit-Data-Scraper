    "postText": "I bought a corner lot home in an established neighborhood back in 2021. The backyard has no fence, is adjacent to an entrance to another neighborhood, and lacks privacy. I plan on getting a fence installed as a result.\n\nMy neighbor, who has lived next to the house I own for about 30 years, had previous agreements with former owners of my home to drive across my current properties backyard, leaving ruts in the soil from his truck. I asked him not to do that. Now, if i am not home, he uses my driveway to access his backyard with his truck by driving between our houses. Hes in his mid sixties and claims to have a constant need to drive his truck back there (IDK what for). \n\nI plan on getting a full property survey done and installing a fence on my property, which in turn will restrict his ability to drive a truck through my yard to get to his.\n\nAITA???",

Here is how the one new neighbor did it, and we appreciated it.  We got a cover letter, letting us know they were putting in a new shared fence, they attached a copy of the survey and the permit as well as a copy of the installers insurance liability. We ended up getting a new gate put in so they match across, it looks really nice.     \n\n\nWe gained three feet, three feet of unmaintained overgrown - but that is a story for another day.  They wanted the fence to be put up on their legal line not what had been accepted.  So we were like ok.  Which is what you are doing.  The thing is, your neighbor is going to be ticked off, but that is on him.  We had a ton of work to do when the fence was moved but in the end it was better for everyone and in your case  you won't have to be 'reminding' him that he is  on your property.  You are not looking for life long friendship you are looking to be respected as a homeowner and there is nothing wrong with that.",

That MIGHT apply to easement by necessity, but not a prescriptive easement and not a subservient and dominant status.) Good grief.  Did you even attend law school?  \n\nAnd if this is California, for example, the use would need to be hostile,  and consent  mears it is not hostile, as I stated earlier. \n\nAs to by necessity, it has to be an ABSOLUTE necessity, not easier, meaning there is no other way to get to his yard without driving over the neighbor's yard. Unless he doesn't have a side yard of his own, which would be quite unusual given houses usually have setbacks, it would be hard to show necessity. He could get a wagon to haul things.",

But i didn\u2019t go to law school to have someone tell me i\u2019m wrong because \u201cgoogle said so!\u201d so this conversation is wearing out its utility. Hostility is treating it like YOU own it. It has almost nothing to do with the actions of the actual owner. \n\nAbsolute necessity is not required. It has more to do with the properties originally being one. \n\nHostility means with respect to ownership interest. You can have \u201cpermission\u201d and still meet the hostility element. \n\nSo get back to me when YOU get tKe the LSAT, go to law school, and get a JD. You are missing ALL the nuance because you think \u201chaha hostility=mean\u201d.",

The backyard has no fence, is adjacent to an entrance to another neighborhood, and lacks privacy. I plan on getting a fence installed as a result.\n\nMy neighbor, who has lived next to the house I own for about 30 years, had previous agreements with former owners of my home to drive across my current properties backyard, leaving ruts in the soil from his truck. I asked him not to do that. Now, if i am not home, he uses my driveway to access his backyard with his truck by driving between our houses. Hes in his mid sixties and claims to have a constant need to drive his truck back there (IDK what for). \n\nI plan on getting a full property survey done and installing a fence on my property, which in turn will restrict his ability to drive a truck through my yard to get to his.\n\nAITA???\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

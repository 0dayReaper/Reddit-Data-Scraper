            "comment": "NTA Asking your son for a basic business plan and quarterly progress reports is the one of the most low pressure asks an entrepreneur can face. He is going to have to deal with start-up costs, finding clients, learning all the facets of running a business, uncertainty, and performing work without a guaranteed return for his efforts. \n\nIf he and your wife expect you to subsidize his cost of living while he pursues this instead of getting a job, it is absolutely reasonable for you to request a plan and updates to make sure this is a legitimate endeavor. It would be far too easy for him to say he's working on a business but not really be doing anything. \n\nHe has no track record of success in anything he's previously done. If he is truly making a sincere effort to build a business he should be excited to share his plan and have the opportunity to update you on his progress and challenges in return for receiving free rent, etc. to help his business get momentum. \n\nThe greatest fear many people have in starting their own business is that they would struggle keeping a roof over their head and food on the table while they're starting out. You would be removing this major hurdle and giving him a priceless gift to allow him the freedom to go after his dream while he's young with no responsibilities. \n\nIf he is this hostile about sharing his business concept and progress then he is likely just all talk and looking for another way to use you for money to subsidize his laziness. You are not being cruel. You are helping him learn responsibility and accountability.",

Also, I apologize for using a throwaway account; I don't want anyone I know to identify my actual account.\n\nI, a 46-year-old man, am married to Sarah, who is 45 years old. Together, we have two children named Matt (21) and Lucy (17) (not their real names).\n\nEver since Matt was young, he faced difficulties with school. I spent a significant amount of time meeting with his teachers and the principal. Although it may not be politically correct to say, I always felt that he had a sense of entitlement and laziness. Matt never had a job, and even when it came time to study for the exams, he never devoted any time to learning. Surprisingly, his scores weren't bad, which led to his acceptance into a nearby community college.\n\nUnfortunately, after a year, Matt was expelled from college due to low grades. I welcomed him back into our home, hoping to provide him with the time and space to find his true calling. However, as the years went by and Sarah fostered an environment free of judgment, Matt still didn't take any steps towards employment. All I saw was him spending his days playing on the computer. Whenever I asked him about his plans for the future, I never received an honest reply.\n\nFinally, I reached my breaking point. I took my wife and son out to dinner and asked Matt about his business and life plans. He informed me that he was working on a startup idea with his friend and believed it had potential. He explained the concept to me, though I must admit I didn't fully understand it. However, my ego wasn't too big to admit that. I told him I would support him in pursuing his idea, without expecting any financial contributions from him. He could stay at home without paying rent or utilities. In return, I asked for quarterly progress reports, as I saw myself as investing in his company's future. Just like any investor, I wanted to stay informed.\n\nMy son called me an a**hole, and my wife disagreed with me. She hasn't spoken to me since. She claims that I'm putting too much pressure on him. But I wonder, what do you think? Am I the asshole (AITA)?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Everyone has to grow up sometime so if you ever want him to be independent and support himself, this kind of in-home-structure and responsibilities seems reasonable. I don't know how much he knows about business plans, how tech savvy he is, etc so you might need to encourage him to do independent learning on this subject. If he has a history of being lazy and entitled, you also might need to really micromanage him and set specific, short term goals every 2 weeks to help keep him on track. Without knowing more about Matt it's hard to say what's going on but i do know that neurodivergence, depression, and executive functioning difficulties can make the task of initiating any kind of work difficult unless you have been taught coping strategies/compensatory strategies (aka- organization skills) to manage the workload. 21 in my opinion is too old to be at home playing video games and living for free unless you have a diagnosis that renders that kind of support. So long story short, you're not the asshole in this situation, from the information at hand. But i think Matt is going to need more support to succeed at the stipulations you've given him!",

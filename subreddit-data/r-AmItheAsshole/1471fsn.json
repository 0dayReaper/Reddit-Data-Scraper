    "postText": "My special needs neighbor is 25-26 years old. He lives with his grandmother up the road where she lets him drive an ATV around so he has something to do. We live in a pretty close neighborhood and everything is really great. It doesn\u2019t bother me that he rides it. He goes slow and never is speeding or anything. However, he quite literally will stop by my house and sit on my front porch EVERY TIME me or my kids (5male, 8 female) are outside. It\u2019s getting to the point we don\u2019t want to be outside because he will stop almost every-time we go out. My children get shy and awkward because they don\u2019t want him there and it\u2019s really awkward but he doesn\u2019t understand social cues. I understand he\u2019s probably lonely and looking for someone to talk to. But we would like to have our own time by ourselves. He doesn\u2019t know when to leave. He just sits there and stares at us. It\u2019s hard to make good conversation with him, and I truly just feel very uncomfortable. I don\u2019t want to make him or his grandmother upset, but I don\u2019t know what else to do other than to tell him or her that he cannot stop by as much. Once in awhile\u2026 sure. But every single day is just too much. Am I being an asshole for thinking this way??",

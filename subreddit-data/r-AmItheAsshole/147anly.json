He also doesn\u2019t need to be keeping you up since you get up early. You both need to give more to the others schedule or adjust your schedules to overlap more. \n\nI will say my rule of thumb is 9:30 am though, that\u2019s when it\u2019s appropriate to mow a yard so in my mind it\u2019s appropriate to start laundry too.",

My partner is a night person which causes him a lot of trouble in his life. \n\nWe often fight because he wants to vacuum at 11:30pm on a weekday and I want to wash at 8am on a weekend.\n\nI've been clear with my needs \"no big chats past 9pm, no loud things past 10:45pm, I'll go home before 12pm\" etc\nHis needs are \"don't use the washing machine while I'm sleeping\" (anytime he is sleeping) and sometimes he snaps if I talk to him too early. (Again, this varies) \n\nHe refuses to set reasonable hours so I can prepare for it, and I'm gonna be a bitch and say that if he needs sleep so much he can go to bed before 4 am, he has a daytime job with office hours. However I dont know what is like to be a night person. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

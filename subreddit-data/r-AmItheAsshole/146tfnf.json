    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI received an exciting opportunity by email following work I have previously done, and I forwarded that email to my friend on WhatsApp, sharing my enthusiasm. She responded, \"congratulations, I am so proud of you!\"\n\nI saw her message about an hour later, while I was on a call with my mother. I smiled when I read it, but I didn't necessarily think that it'd have warranted a response right away. I thought I would finish my call with my family first and then respond. Except, that call lasted for three hours. When I ended the call, I checked my WhatsApp messages back and she angrily responded: \"Wow! And you couldn't even say 'thanks'? Even Chat-GPT is more illuminative than you are.\" She wasn't being jokey, she was genuinely mad. I apolgised, explaining the situation. Now, it's been hours she read my messages but didn't respond, which is very unusual. She may be busy, but I suspect that she's doing it to show her unhappiness towards what I did yesterday.\n\nI don't know how to react to that, and I don't know whether I am actually faulty. I did send her the following message:\n\n&gt;I understand that you are upset that I did not immediately respond to your message. I opened it while I was on a call and intended to respond to it after I finish to talk, however, from your perspective, that looked like I dismissed it completely. I am sorry you felt this way, it was really not my intention and I also apologise for belittling your concerns by not addressing or apologising earlier\n\n...which she hasn't responded to (despite having seen it). What do you think of that?\n\nTL;dr = I failed to immediately respond to a congratulatory message my friend sent and she grew mad at me for that reason. I now suspect that she is intentionally dismissing my messages by seeing them and not responding, after hours.",

It\u2019s not like an emergency text too, it\u2019s just a congrats text. \n\nDid your friend not consider that maybe you would be sharing the good news with other people? Other people a bit closer and important to you LIKE YOUR FAMILY?? Your friend sounds so entitled and self-centred, turning your good news into THEIR celebration.",

Sure it\u2019s nice to say thanks back, but nobody is entitled to a response from you and it doesn\u2019t feel like something that warrants an immediate response.\n\nThis seems like an extreme reaction and I don\u2019t think you should apologise any further as this will encourage their entitlement. I can see you want your friend to feel valued, but don\u2019t burn yourself out over it.\n\nWe can\u2019t reply to messages indefinitely. After you say thank you, then is she going to say that you\u2019re welcome? After that will you say that it\u2019s your pleasure? When does it end??\n\nYou did well, she congratulated you. It\u2019s perfectly normal to not reply straightaway, take as much time as you like. Personally I think it\u2019s fine if you didn\u2019t reply at all. I think sending congratulations is like sending a gift. We shouldn\u2019t expect something back just because we\u2019ve given something.",

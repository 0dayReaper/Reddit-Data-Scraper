Your father recently died and neither him or your mom should be trying to push the step dad role onto you. I completely understand why you\u2019d lose it like that. It still too soon for him to be trying to take your fathers position. He probably means no harm but he has to understand given the circumstances and why you\u2019d feel the way you do.",

Plenty of people misread a situation with their own bias, or don't realize how a disorder requires a pattern and not a couple of isolated incidents. \n\nThis general advice works for pretty much anything on here - if it takes more knowledge than Google can provide yet someone thinks Google was all they needed to be an expert, they are just a moron who thinks a bit too highly of their intelligence.",

They are NOT episodic. \n\nEveryone thinks they\u2019re an expert, when in reality, most of the general population\u2019s understanding of mental health diagnoses are based upon stereotypes or inaccurate information. \n\nSo just because your dog or whatever gives you a weird look that upsets you does not mean they have NPD, so cut that crap.",

First; I am so deeply sorry for the loss of your dad.  That is very hard. You are too young to have to go without your dad.  As far as Uncle Daddy this is nuts!  This guy may very well be a great guy but he is giving me red flags all over this.  The entire situation is moving way too fast.  Is it possible he feels threatened by you?  Is it possible he wants to control you and your mom? I think you were well within your rights to lay out the ground rules as far as your relationship.  If your mother has any issues with your compliance to the house rules of her home then you and your mom need to have a conversation one on one.  I would suggest that said convo be rather frank and that house rules be hers not Uncle Daddy's.  It sounds like you may have lost both of your parents Honey and I am so sorry. I am sorry that your entire family is falling for the company line.  Time has a tendency to fade all that is shiny and new.  We shall see what appears when it fades.  Good luck.",

Given the state of Texas and our pastor highly encourages pre marital counselling, we did the required sessions happily. \n\nOne of the sessions focused on the kids. I expressed that parenting an 18 year old would be ridiculous, but I hoped I could be a mentor. As long as reasonable house rules for an adult were followed, I was good. \n\nThe counselor said that was great as a lot of reasonable people will try to lean far too hard into the stepparent role and start asserting authority they have no business trying. Even with adult children of their partners. \n\nSo sadly this is not all that uncommon, it just takes some insecurity and crap blows up.",

Parenting changes slowly as your kids grow older, it's not like the kids turn 18 and suddenly you treat them very different. It's a process that both the parent and the kid go through, learning to respect the kids decisions. He's never gone through this process and doesn't know how to be the parent of an adult. \n\nThis isn't to say he should be, I'm just trying to give a but of his point of view. He definitely needed told off, so kudos there. Hopefully you guys can begin to build a kind of relationship that's healthy for you.\n\nEDIT: In light of OP's edit, my view kind of changes. If BF is not living with OPs mom then BF doesnt have any place trying to tell OP what to do. \n\nEven at 23, if OP is living in his mothers house (even in separate apartments as stated), OP should (in my opinion) still have some respect for moms wishes. Mom made it clear she doesn't care, so BF has no place overstepping moms thoughts on the matter.",

Fine that he\u2019s now part of the family, but like OP said, he\u2019s not his father, and especially for not having been around that much is wayyy overstepping, among other things with setting curfew. If he truly believes that OP should have a curfew, I think he should leave it up to OP\u2019s mom to do so, he\u2019s really in no position, no matter how old the kids are.",

I'm on OP's side here as I don't think some dude who has been in a woman's life for no more than a cup of coffee shouldn't trying to be parenting an adult child. That being said, in a general sense, if you're still living at home as an adult, you kind of need to respect your parents' rules. If you don't like it, you're welcome to get your own place, and I'm of the opinion that rules should definitely be relaxed quite a bit (coming home at 3am really doesn't need to be that big of a deal), but if they have a rule they won't budge on, follow it or pack up.\n\nI have a huge problem here in that it doesn't seem like his mom isn't stepping in here, and his mom should be doing any parenting in this situation. It's extremely weird that such a short term boyfriend is stepping into an authority role already (it's actually a little weird to me that dad died a year ago and they're all already living together, seems pretty quick, but whatever), it kind of makes him look like a controlling nut job.",

She's his partner, not my mother.  \n\nIf the wife tried to pull the shit that OP's mom's bf is doing, I would have flipped my shit a long fucking time ago.

But OP is an adult, old enough to legally purchase alcohol, cigarettes, vote and gamble.  Mom's bf is fucking deluded trying to take away privileges and ground an adult, not a child but a fucking adult, because he's trying to assert his dominance like the fucking dumb shit he is.  Not to mention that he's only the boyfriend, not the stepfather (although even if he was the stepfather, that shit still wouldn't matter( because OP is an adult.",

In her minds eye I am still this little kid who needs boundaries and apparently bed times. Also OP you are NTA and your mom's new BF trying to step in and be your new farther when you are old enough to have both a childhood and adult realtionship with your actual farther speaks volumes about that man's emotional intelligence.

She\u2019s been pushing us to work things out on our own since she isn\u2019t a mediator, and as adults, she thinks him and i should be able to work things out. \n\nWe\u2019ve talked a little about it but we both get hotheaded and walk away to cool off and nothing really gets resolved. We\u2019ve argued about my curfew before. My mom doesn\u2019t like me being out late, but her and my dad had worked out a system with me where i didn\u2019t have a curfew but their concerns were still addressed to an extent. He felt that since my dad wasn\u2019t around anymore i should only be thinking about my mom and that my mom doesn\u2019t like me out late. I pulled the adult card, he told me i love in my mother\u2019s basement, i said i wasn\u2019t his child. We agreed to disagree and talk about it later. We never did. \n\nWe got into it over the car before too. My dad got it for me. But he put it in his name and everything. I had to pay for certain stuff and if i graduated with honours i could have it in my name. Otherwise i\u2019d have to buy it from him or he\u2019d keep it. When dad died mom put it in her name, and i sold dads truck (which as left to me in his estate) and paid off the car with the money + some of my own. She\u2019s kept it in her name but agreed to transfer ownership to me once i\u2019m stable enough to pay for insurance on my own. Boyfriend felt that it was my moms car because her name is on the ownership, and felt that he could use it to teach his eldest to drive. His car is awkward and not ideal for that. he also thought his kid and i could share the car/could be her car once i graduated/moved out. Mom actually stepped in here and said it was my car but only bc that got really heated. \n\nOther things like chores and responsibilities have worked out pretty well. He\u2019s usually willing to compromise and be reasonable.",

He might feel responsible but you're an adult who met him past the drinking age in the US. You have your own financial responsibilities and it's unfair of him to not honour any past agreements made with your parents.  If he want to help and he feels responsible for your well-being, he absolutely shouldn't be forcing his own views on you. Your an adult with your own car in a different name for insurance purposes, a common tactic for young people. There's nothing wrong with it. Whether or not there even is, he should honour your past agreements with your parents because they were made with them - not him. He doesn't inherit everything you and your dad made together just because he's dating your mom. He's only helping the family if it's compatible with your established views. Doing it because he expects you to listen to him is unfair and uncalled for and not helpful. You are NTA.",

It doesn\u2019t justify everything but it definitely make him easier to understand. \n\nNo. He doesn\u2019t live with us all the time and he doesn\u2019t own the house at all so he can\u2019t. I\u2019m never at his place so he\u2019s never had a chance to do something like that. The closest he got was asking me to stop smoking weed inside and gave me some reasons why he\u2019d like me to stop. It felt reasonable so i agreed lmao.",

Ask her if she wants to sacrifice her relationship with you so step dad (which he isn\u2019t even) can play the hero. \n\nYour dad has only been gone a year, this guy is not married to your mom, and he doesn\u2019t even live in the same house as you. He\u2019s trampling so many lines and boundaries while your mom just expects you two to tower it out. That\u2019s only going to work if your moms boyfriend can treat you like an equal, until he can do that it is 100% on your mom.",

If that makes him seem like a horrible person, consider that the only difference between this thread and your personal interactions is that he's not around to charm or explain his way out of it.\n\nListen, the reason people are telling you to be suspicious isn't because we lack information. It's not because you've built him up as some obviously deadbeat abuser. It's not because we don't know what a humble guy he seems to be. It's not because we don't know that he spends all that time helping homeless people, or that he's always first to aid your disabled aunt.\n\nIt's because of *everything* you've told us, including the good parts.\n\nFirst off, despite him being so humble about it, would you feel it's fair to say that everyone still ends up knowing about all the good things he does? And second, think about those two examples you've given; helping homeless people and always being first to help a disabled family member immediately leap out to me as being very *public* displays of morality and generosity. As does the restaurant and engagement ring stuff.\n\nNow, granted, you can't say that everyone who helps the homeless only does so to publically display their virtue. While they are the type of things that someone would do if they were intentionally trying to convince themselves and/or others that they're a good person, they're also the kind of things that genuinely nice people do. It could go either way.\n\nThe thing that leans me towards the latter interpretation is the field of red flags contained in your neutral descriptions of his behaviour toward you.\n\nLet me put this flatly. It is not reasonable to be angry at a 23 year old for getting home at 2AM. \"Flipping out\" because an adult had a night out is completely insane. This is not just just an issue of you not wanting to follow his rules, it's not an issue of him having a different parenting style to your dad, it's an issue of him having a disturbing need for control. (And despite him being such a humble guy, he apparently has enough pride and stubbornness to regularly get into arguments with you in which he refuses to back down and casts doubt on your motivations, as you frequently describe things getting \"heated\".)\n\nYou've known him since you were 10. *He's known you since you were 10*. He's been dating your mother for a year now. \"Not knowing how to parent a young adult\" isn't a reasonable explanation here. You're not some great mystery to him. The only difference between now and before he started dating your mother is that now he considers you a part of his household, under his domain, and that therefore you ought to be under his control.\n\nYou made this post for a reason. Your mother's boyfriend is acting in a way that is not just unreasonable, it's downright disturbing. His personal charm and reputation obscures the underlying nature of his behaviour, turning others against you and making you doubt yourself. So you made a post on the internet to ask others if you're in the right.\n\nAnd we're telling you that you are. You're more right than you let yourself believe. I'm not saying he's secretly evil or anything, but he definitely sounds like someone with capital 'I' Issues. Issues that, if unacknowledged and left undealt with, could seriously hurt the people around him like he's currently hurting you.\n\nYou don't have to convince people that he's secretly a monster and they should abandon him, because he's not and they shouldn't. But you should continue to be wary of him and continue to have faith in yourself. And keep an eye out to support others who may try to assert their independence from him in the future, such as his daughters.",

It's a terrible thing to lose someone so suddenly. I hope you had wonderful times together, and that those memories can carry you through this awkward and difficult situation. I hope your mom is the kind of lady you can tell these things to, and that she'll be able to see it from your perspective and tell this guy to stop trying to parent her adult son.",

In his case, he's only at the level of parenting a 15 year old and hasn't adapted to understand what being 23 really means.  \n\n\nI think you should have a calm conversation with him. When no one else is around, maybe at a pub and out of the house, to reinforce the fact you're not 15. Explain that you appreciate his role in your Mother's life, but you're not a child, and you became a fully formed adult with your father in your life. You're now 23 and have had a huge transformative life event, that's made you have to grow up. Reiterate that he;'s great with your mother and you want him to be involved in your family, but he can't be your father, you have a father, he might not be with us anymore but he was there for your childhood, and transition into adulthood, it's too late for a surrogate father now, and that's fine.  \n\n\nI'd point out what being 23 means, that the difference between you and his oldest is 8 years, and he's parenting you like you're 15, which is the equivalent of parenting his 13 year old like she's five.  \n\n\n  \nYou're not the arsehole btw. But I just think he doesn't \"get\" what 23 means.",

Their relationship would be different. You don't need him to be your dad, you need him to be there for your mother and his daughters.\n\nThen also maybe speak to your mother point out that you feel he's trying to be your father, but you only have one father and he's sadly not around.",

Same situation with a grow-up person? The role the step-parent will have is \"significant other of parent\", because **the parenting job is already over**.\n\nBeing sent to your room?

You\u2019re an only child, you were raised as an only child. He needs to stay in his lane, your stuff is between you and your mom only. And your extended family can go pound tar they aren\u2019t in the situation you are. He needs to get it into his head that he\u2019s only dating your mom, they aren\u2019t married and even then at any point she can walk away so he really needs to drop it. Truth be told you might never see him as a father figure and that\u2019s ok. They have to live with that. You need to sit down with your mother though and set your boundaries. Make it clear that while you\u2019re happy for her this isn\u2019t going to happen..and you don\u2019t have to accept them as family either or listen to anything he says. Your belongings are yours and yours alone so when it comes to that he does have to back off and if your mother doesn\u2019t like it to bad on that.",

And id be so down to play video games with his kids and teach them how to build and program things. But only on my terms. Like it genuinely felt like i was 5 being told i need to share instead of suggesting i introduce my hobbies to his kids. \n\nmy mother has been fairly neutral in this entire thing. I think i\u2019m a few days i may sit down and talk to her bc this post has made me feel like i\u2019ve been dealing with exceptionally well lmao",

I\u2019d be worried for your moms mental health too. She went through a bad lose too and she might be compensating with this guy. He really doesn\u2019t know his place he\u2019s a boyfriend that\u2019s it, not husband so he doesn\u2019t get a say and I really hope your mom starts having your back more.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t give in with your stuff at all. He\u2019ll start taking it and making family use. Plus it\u2019s none of his business. He can throw a hissy fit like a toddler all he wants but you have no obligation to listen to him.\n\nHuman being are very complex creatures so just because he does some nice things and volunteers doesn\u2019t make him good or bad. He can be good with everyone else and still be a a shit stain to you. When it comes down to it, how he acts towards you is the only thing that matters when it comes to a relationship with him. He might genuinely be trying to help you but it could also easily be getting rid of you because you won\u2019t fit into his mold of family. You don\u2019t and can\u2019t really know so watch out for yourself.",

My grandfather was a respected member of his community, a leader in his local Knights of Columbus and when he died, hundreds of people came out to his funeral to celebrate his life of charity and goodwill towards the community.    \n\nBehind closed doors, he was a psycho who abused his kids, beat his wife and molested one of his daughters.

He hasn\u2019t really taken over anything, he has a key to our house but he doesn\u2019t live here all the time, he doesn\u2019t drive our vehicles and usually buys the majority of the food. Doesn\u2019t pay our bills or touch my mother money (her and i have joint access to all her accounts so i would\u2019ve seen anything fishy). The only thing he\u2019s really tried to take over is being my father which is the problem. \n\nI\u2019ll definitely talk to my mom about her mental health though and just make sure everything\u2019s okay. Even with my father though she was very neutral. so was my dad. As i got older it was more of a \u201cyou and your parent are adults you figure it out,\u201d approach to conflict so over all I haven\u2019t seen this as a red flag. \n\nOh definitely. I\u2019m not worried about him making it his but i\u2019m just a petty dick and don\u2019t want to do something i don\u2019t have to after i was made to feel ridiculous about it.",

You\u2019ve rejected his advances and made it clear that you\u2019re grieving and dont need a new dad, and he still goes on with this sick power play. From what you\u2019re telling about the car, he sounds a little bit like a gold digger too?\n\nAnyway you really need to have a very serious conversation with your mom. This is her boyfriend and she can\u2019t expect you guys to handle this yourselves when he treats you like shit! Show her that you\u2019re the one being an reasonable adult about this and maybe invite her out to lunch or dinner, so you get a safe space away from home and evil stepfather, and get a chance to talk it all through. She needs to set some boundaries with that guy and tell him to get off your back. Her monkey, her circus.\n\nIf you just keep letting this happen and leave after graduation, your mom will lose her son, because how much will you really come home to visit with that guy around? And do you really want to leave her like that so soon after losing your dad? \nI\u2019m so sorry about your loss, and i hope you can still fix things with your mom.",

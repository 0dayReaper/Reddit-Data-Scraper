They do not understand that if they go outside they are likely to be hurt or killed and the odds of them never being able to go back to their nice safe warm house again are very high indeed.\n\nCats who need antibiotics often don\u2019t want to eat pills or have an injection. Cats with cancer don\u2019t want to go to the vet. Cats want to eat plants even if those plants are poisonous to them. Cats do not get to make decisions about their living situations or medical care because cats don\u2019t have higher order reasoning. It is up to humans to protect them in an environment they are not capable of making wider decisions regarding. Letting pet animals do whatever they want regardless of their safety is animal cruelty.",

Another owner with safe outdoor space will be a better fit. There are some cats that don\u2019t desire to go outside at all because of their temperament and/or experience. That\u2019s probably a better cat for OP. As soon as you realize you have a cat temperamentally ill-suited for an indoor-only environment, you should be looking for a proper home for them. Remaining the owner for the rest of their natural lives and denying them the basic freedom of going outside is simply jailing an animal for your own enjoyment. Being able to go outside for an animal is not the same as taking cancer medications, and you should really reflect on that.",

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo I (23F) need to go away on a work trip for a week and have asked my younger brother (18M) to live in my place and care for my two cats. He\u2019s excited because he\u2019s always lived at my parents and it\u2019s like a dorm trial before college in the fall. \n\n\nProblem is my parents are antsy about him being there alone. Admittedly I don\u2019t live in the best area, but so long as he hangs out indoors and plays video games all week likes he\u2019s planning he\u2019ll be fine. My dad works in the same city and wants to visit him after work, bring him dinner, make sure he\u2019s ok, ect. \n\nThe problem I have with that is I literally have one house rule that my dad has failed to follow almost every time he has visited. That one rule is that my cats need to be secured in my bedroom with the door closed before the front door opens. My first cat, I\u2019ve had him for a year now, was either a stray or an outdoor cat before being surrendered to the shelter. While he loves cuddling and being around people, he also desperately wants to go outside, and even now a year later he meows at the doors and windows to be let out. Leaving the politics of outdoor cats aside, I live in a very dangerous area for a cat. On one side of my apartment is a five lane two way road, and on the other side is a four labe road, both being very busy. The back of my apartment is a busy bank. If my cat were to get out and run from being scared, it\u2019d practically be a death certificate. \n\n\nEven though I\u2019ve reminded my dad of this one rule every time he visits he always opens the front door while the cats are out. I\u2019m vigilant and catch him and remind him, but he always gets defensive and brushes it off as an accident then does it again, sometimes twice in one visit. He often tries to stand there having conversation with the door open. My parents cats have gotten out because of this but because they live in a suburb they\u2019ve always been ok. My brother is a little absent minded and gets absorbed in his video games so if my dad tries this while I\u2019m not there I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll catch it before my boy can sneak out. \n\n\nThus I\u2019ve banned my dad from my place and he\u2019s extremely angry. He keeps insisting that he won\u2019t do it again and that he doesn\u2019t want my brother there alone. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Look for a new home for the cat where it can be itself and be loved for being itself.",

My ultimate goal is to move somewhere with a catio in the future and allow him to enjoy fresh air that way. \n\nWhile he does want outside, he is extremely bonded to me and I have no doubt I am the right owner for him. Not to mention he has some health problems that I\u2019ve been thorough about managing and outdoor life would absolutely make uncontrollable.",

They eliminate entire species from the planet. You seem to recognize this in the first part of your post. \n\nYet, you still treat the individual specimen you\u2019re caring for like it\u2019s not worthy of outdoor life, and its lifespan needs to be preserved\u2026 but for whose benefit is that really? Is forcing a cat to stay indoors for its own health benefiting either the cat or society writ large? \n\nIn my opinion, extending the lifespan of a street cat by converting it to an indoor-only cat really only benefits you, the owner, because you get more time with the individual cat that you\u2019re forming an emotional bond with. Your father cannot even come to your residence because of just how strongly your cat wants to go outside. It\u2019s not a whim, it\u2019s your cat\u2019s fervent wish. If you want to spend the rest of its life denying it what it wants, that\u2019s your prerogative. It\u2019s legal in this country and the rest of Reddit will affirm you in that decision. But you\u2019re still going to have to live with the reality that every time your cat tries to escape, it\u2019s telling you it wants something you can\u2019t give it.",

Sure my cat wants out and asks to be let out, but it\u2019s not a constant need, he\u2019ll ask a couple times a week maybe, and I\u2019m 90% sure this want is highly correlated to the birds that land outside my apartment. My dad visits my appartement when I\u2019m here. I\u2019m just extra cautious because of where I live. \n\nI do every thing in my power to make sure he receives what he needs indoors. He has many toys that I make sure to regularly play with him, he has a water fountain, cat tree, and I put on cat tv so he can watch all kinds of animals- inside. Also as I mentioned he has health issues that would not be manageable outside, it\u2019s my responsibility to keep him healthy and happy. It\u2019s also my responsibility as a member of this planet to keep him from decimating local animal populations because he is an invasive species. \n\nOne day he will have a catio and maybe even go in harness walks. It\u2019s my responsibility to make sure he\u2019s happy- and he is, like I said it\u2019s not a constant need to go outdoors and he sleeps with me every night- not my responsibility to uphold every single desire. He also wants to eat the trash and will tell you that is an intense desire, I also don\u2019t allow that.",

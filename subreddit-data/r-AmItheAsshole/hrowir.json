All the guys start bowing down to Eric til the mom says something like, \"Eww, no!

Eric had left his car unlocked, so... \n\nThen, of course, all the kids were grossed out thinking about Donna's parents having sex in his car.",

My then-boyfriend found a pair of my Spongebob boxers on the ground once and immediately demanded to know who I cheated on him with. I laughed and said they were mine. It was only because I sewed up the fly that he believed me.\n\nAt the time, at age 19, I thought it was a funny incident. It's only later that I think back in horror of how badly it could have gone if I hadn't made a practice of always sewing up the flies of my boxer shorts. He got so angry so fast that I could image it easily becoming dangerous for me. We did break up 6 months later.",

I don't know what \"difficult\" means, so if there were more info on what exactly your daughter's done that is so awful maybe that can change.\n\nBut I'm saying YTA because you just sat back and let your daughter believe that someone she loves enough to marry had deeply hurt and betrayed her. You sat there and laughed quietly to yourself and enjoyed her pain. Again, I will acknowledge that maybe this is an E-S-H situation, but you should seriously examine why hurting your daughter is fucking funny to you. Is that amusement worth the damage to your relationship with your daughter? Do you think the potential long term consequences are worth it, or should you maybe get over it and reach out with a sincere attempt at talking out your problems like adults? \n\nShe went from thinking her fiance had betrayed her to knowing her father would let her believe in a lie like that *because he thought her suffering was funny*. Funny does not mean you didn't do something hurtful, and she is 100% justified in being unwilling to speak with you over this.",

I ran a load of laundry and while it was drying, my girlfriend at the time (now is my wife) came over my apartment.  We were hanging out and I realized my load was done. Grabbed it from the dryer and dumped it on the bed to fold, she started helping me.\n\nShe pulls a pair of woman's panties from the pile and asks what are these?  I was genuinely dumbfounded.  I didnt recognize them and asked if they are hers?  She didnt recognize them either.  The next few seconds were tense for me as I realized the implications and was bracing myself for a fight with her.  I tried to explain that I had no idea who those belong to and had practically no explanation as to how they got into my laundry.  I was starting to panic but she reached and put her hand on my arm and said she believed me.  Its shared laundry facilities and perhaps this is the neighbor's laundry that got left behind in the machine, made it into my laundry load.  I really wasnt cheating and with a relief, I told her it sounded good to me.  \n\nAbout your post, yes are TA for letting a fight carry on and withholding information like that. BUT, I understand why you did it.  I'd be reluctant to insert myself into a couple's fight also.  You did have ulterior motives too, proving the stability of their relationship. All in all, NTA",

That doesn\u2019t mean we have a bad relationship or that there\u2019s not an open line of communication \u2014 it\u2019s just a pretty obvious conclusion to draw, and this is usually how cheaters are caught (it\u2019s the equivalent of finding a bra in your partner\u2019s car). Maybe she forgot she was living with another woman in the house, but in that moment she was emotionally vulnerable. You let your daughter cry, scream and sob for the better part of THIRTY minutes (that\u2019s HALF AN HOUR) and when your wife came home and revealed the truth, you LAUGHED. Your daughter was crying of a broken-heart and you LAUGHED. You showed no empathy for your daughter or her heart. I get that you don\u2019t like her fianc\u00e9 and that she\u2019s been irritating you by staying with you, but that is one of the most cold-hearted things I\u2019ve ever heard. You are definitely the AH. Her father let her believe the man she loved and planned to marry was cheating on her, and you laughed when you were caught. Would you have ever told her if they had broken up, or did you plan to keep it to yourself for all eternity if your wife didn\u2019t show up?

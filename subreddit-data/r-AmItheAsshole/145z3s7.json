Even if you were an adult, you'd be within your right not to take care of her like that, even more so if she's abusive. It's also not like it's the cancer changing her brain chemistry if she was always like that.",

Please don't feel guilty about this, it's not your job to police how she feels.  She's not your child, it's not on you to take care of her.  I used to think if I were just kinder and more loving to my mother, perhaps it would help her heal and then she would stop being cruel to me.  That was utterly naive - people like this don't change, they just take each instance of your kindness and love as an opportunity to hurt you further.  I think they get a kick out of seeing how far they can take it.  Maybe ask your Dad if he can get you into some therapy to help you figure out how to navigate all of this?  Best of luck from this internet stranger, stay strong and don't give in to your mother's demands.",

She was diagnosed in February and didn't tell me until late March, although I already knew. My mum and I don't have a good relationship. My parents split up when I was 4 and I got to stay with my dad 2 nights a week. I have anxiety and depression, and I knew that staying at her house would make both of those things worse, but I decided to stay. It's been just over 2 months since she started chemo and things have gotten progressively worse since then. Last week, she nearly reversed the car into me and laughed about it. On Monday, she came back from chemo expecting me to have cooked for her, not knowing what time she'd be back, I hadn't done it. She had texted and called me, but my phone is on do not disturb and I wasn't using it, so I couldn't see her messages. She screamed at me, calling me a \"selfish b*tch\". She uses stuff like that to describe me often, but I'd had enough and told her I was going to stay with my dad. I've been staying with him for 6 days now and it's been so much better. My dad does live around 4.5 miles away from my school, which is impractical.\n\nMy mum has threatened to kick me out multiple times, and has kicked me out once. I came out to her as bi last year and straight away she told me it was just a phase. My dad took me to see her today so I could get some clothes. It seemed she was under the impression I would be staying overnight with her, but it was just to pop in. She called me a \"selfish cow\" and shouted at bothe and my dad. She wants me to move back in but the way she is treating me makes it less and less likely to happen. My granny died last year, and I made so many sacrifices to support her through that, but now that I finally put myself first I'm being punished for it. Seeing her today made me feel like I am the worst person in the world and the idea of going back terrifies me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It isn\u2019t your job. You are not an asshole, you are escaping an abusive situation.\n\nDo not go back if you do not feel safe doing so- and from everything I\u2019ve seen here, you do not feel safe. Has your dad said anything about the distance from school being impractical or is that you worrying about causing difficulties before anyone says anything? (Or is it more impractical for you personally because your friends etc are kinda far away now?). This may just be a sign of me being a country bumpkin but 4.5 miles is closer than my school was lol. It was a bit of a pain in the arse (quite literally- because I cycled there and back) but I still did extra-curricular activities and still got invited to people\u2019s houses and trips out and stuff. If you\u2019re worried about your dad finding it impractical to drop you off and pick you up etc, talk to him about it. I mean, he has seen first hand what she\u2019s like to you.

She, like me, just went about her life until she eventually saw the texts. \n\n\nJust because a phone lets you see who's calling, doesn't mean you are looking at that moment.\n\nNice try though.",

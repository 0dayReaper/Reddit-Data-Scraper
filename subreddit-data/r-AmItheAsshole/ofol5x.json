    "postText": "My aunt and uncle are paying for my cousins college.  \n\nMy dad had a college fund for me, but he had stipulations like he wanted nothing below a B for grades and to pre approve any classes I take, weekly meetings to discuss grades and a bunch of other stuff. Which would be fine if you have a normal dad. Mine isn't.  \n\nMy dad has a temper and I spent 6th-12th grade stressed out about grades and being screamed at or grounded over things that sometimes weren't even my fault like a teacher not updating online grading and an assignment being marked \"missing\" because of it.  And getting my back pack and locker randomly searched by him for no reason besides \"to make sure I'm not hiding anything \". \n\nI decided to pay for school myself because of 1 not being stressed over getting screamed at 2 I didn't feel like constantly worrying that he'd disapprove  of a class or a grade and decide not to pay. Which I could totally see him doing.  I'd rather be in debt than controlled for 4 more years.  \n\nI just finished my first year. \n\nWell my family got together on the 4th and... well sometimes they're nosey.   They were talking about my cousins school and my uncle looked at my dad and said \"well how much is - my name- school costing you?\" \n\nI said \"what are you asking him for I'm the one paying for it?\" \n\nLater on my dad was pissed off and said that it was out of line to say that and I embarrassed him. \n\n\nI didn't do it to embarrass him, I was just being honest.  He doesn't even know how much tuition is so he was the wrong person to ask. \n\nAITA",

Half that time is getting to the destination, hour long lunch even if it\u2019s against the rules, 5 minutes before and 5 minutes after each job scrolling on Reddit or something probably. \n\nI\u2019m working my first labor gig this year and I feel like I\u2019ve been totally duped by all my previous employers into thinking that work was just gonna suck no matter where I went.\n\nI\u2019ll gladly \u201cwork\u201d an extra 20 hours a week for the rest of my life if it means the pay and freedom is this good.\n\nEdit: Also it\u2019s not that back breaking like some would suggest. Personally I view it as paid supplemental fitness. I go to the gym almost every day after work and bust out a full effort 1hr+ routine, and then go home and do a little bit extra stuff like 20 minutes of grip strength training. I wouldn\u2019t be able to work out like this if work was killer. I\u2019ve had lower paying jobs that took a lot more active effort than labor. Warehouses are some of the worst offenders.",

Injury is the worst possible thing you can do when your goal is to build muscle though, and is much worse than missing a few days of training.",

Streaking was big on campus his senior year, and he had a picture in it of him driving a truck full of streakers.  Because you couldn't see his junk, they didn't blank out his face.  I kept that on my door the rest of my college career to remind me that he wasn't as perfect as he claimed to be.",

I imagine the internet helps with that now so people like OP can ask basically the world, but I didn't REALLY figure out how wrong it was until therapy when I was 40!  I mentioned it in passing and the therapist kept circling back on that topic.  It was eye opening what was happening during my childhood that wasn't \"normal.\"",

Best of luck to you!",

Demanding that you get a parents preapproval on any courses? NO. It is YOUR college education and YOU get to choose what classes you take and what you major in, etc. And Weekly meetings to discuss grades? Again, NO. WAY too often. Even monthly is too often unless you have a history of getting poor grades. Your father sounds like a control freak beyond the pale. \n\nOP, I can safely say you are NTA",

Soon he'll throw it back in your face and say if you can pay for college, you can pay rent. Then you have to follow XYZ rules to stay there. Then rent and rules or you're kicked out, etc. I'm sure that confrontation is in your future.",

It's bad enough you may get stress out with a class or 2 plus exams and projects and the finals but all of that is all normal.

My kids want to take a film course, women\u2019s studies, marine biology or  greek literature it ain\u2019t my call. Now I might not agree with the choice but you want your kids to find their passion, even if doesn\u2019t wind up making a career.  Education doesn\u2019t guarantee success but it does require and instills responsibility and thought. So if you graduate with a degree in European agrarian economics in the 16 century you might not find a job in your field, whatever that is, but you have learned process and discipline and I would be proud of my kids regardless.\n\nNow I don\u2019t know about you or your dad. But I do take pride in that I am able to get my kids off on the right foot so they don\u2019t incur debt. I worry about this generation\u2019s future because of the uphill battles they will face in buying home, saving for the future, finding meaningful employment. Your dad could have given you this gift but you decided you didn\u2019t need the hassle, and I have mad respect for you for that. And if I was your dad I would have no right to be pissed because you wanted to do it on your own.\n\nI can see how he was embarrassed. Obviously he feels  he has fallen short as a father because he didn\u2019t foot the bill and that was communicated to a family member which exposes the stressors between you both. But you did nothing wrong per se but you might have been better off letting him answer. That could have been embarrassing too but you wouldn\u2019t have been part of the equation. Regardless you answered truthfully and there is nothing wrong with being truthful. So NTA.\n\nBut one last comment- I am proud of you. You have stepped up and are pursuing education on your own terms. Stay ahead of your debt and enjoy your time in school.",

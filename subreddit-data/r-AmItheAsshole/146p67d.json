Maybe Hannah wasn't even a problem, and others were just jealous. You have no idea what the real situation is.

I ended up inviting around 7 friends as I didn\u2019t want to go too crazy and respect my parents house. (Yes, I have been living with my parents as the living costs in my area are ridiculously high and I also am paying for my college as well).\n\nRecently, my friend Avery(21f) introduced me to her friend Hannah (21f) and we are more so acquaintances than friends(in my eyes). As it turns out Hannah has a boyfriend(Very nice guy). This confused my friend Sarah(21f) as she thought it seemed like Hannah was flirting with me and \u201cterritorial\u201d(Please note I am not the sharpest tool in the shed when it comes to picking up signals from others). Well before the party Hannah, Sarah, and I were hanging out at Avery\u2019s place one night and apparently when Avery and I were in the other room Hannah told Sarah to back off and that she(Sarah) wasn\u2019t good enough for me (Sarah and I used to have a fling but stopped it early and decided to be friends). After this, Hannah would give Sarah harsh glares. \n\nWell when I texted Avery to invite her to the kickback Hannah apparently saw the text. She asked Avery if she could join and me not being great with decision making said sure. When I told Sarah that she was really sad and nervous. As she was going out of state for a couple weeks and this was a nice little chance for everyone to relax and hangout together. She stated how she was uncomfortable with Hannah being there (especially while we are drinking) and told me what Hannah has been doing. I didn\u2019t want to create any bad blood and was even ok with not drinking and just staying by Sarah\u2019s side the whole night, but she said that she wanted me to relax and enjoy myself. Now I greatly care for my friends and want to make sure they enjoy themselves, but I am also a people pleaser. So, I texted Hannah telling her that I was sorry and that I it into something smaller, but I was planning on rescheduling a bigger party later on. \n\nI see Hannah when I walk to work as we work pretty close to one another and she has been avoiding me. I feel like an ah because I know how it feels to be left out of group events and especially uninvited last minute. However, I would much rather have the person I am closer with and whose friendship I value more, to be happy and comfortable than be on guard a whole night. \n\nAITA?\n\nAlso to clarify, I always have only seen Hannah as an acquaintance and if she ever tried something I would tell her bf.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "postText": "I (22F) am currently living in an apartment with another girl, A. We went into this lease with the assumption that it would be a one year-ish lease, and it would end when we both got into grad school. Well, she got in, and I did not. So I'm stuck here for another year, and she has to move out in August for grad school. The lease ends in October. She wasn't planning on this when she initially signed onto the lease, but since she has to move into a new apartment closer to the school, and school starts in August, she had no choice.\n\nConveniently, I had a very good friend (we'll call her C) who was moving to the area a few months prior to August! So we formed a plan: C would get a short-term lease nearby, and take over the lease when A moved out. As of right now, the first part of the plan has gone forward. C now lives across the street from us.\n\nThis weekend, C sent me a text that she could no longer move in in August. At first, I thought it was a financial thing, like her current place being a jerk and I offered to both help her move and to pay for the lease breaking. Turns out, she really hated moving and doesn't want to move again so soon. She says that it was very damaging to her mental health and that she'd maybe be able to move in October, when the lease is up. That leaves me having to cover 2 months rent on my own (an extra 1500 a month, give or take).\n\nAt the time of her telling me this, I reminded her that she's screwing me over financially, and while A can cover August rent, I cannot cover the months until she gets the mental stability to move in. My apartment doesn't let me sublet, so I can't find someone to take up rent in the interim. WIBTAH if I told her she has to buck up and move in with me in August, or else I have no choice but to find someone else to take over the lease permanently? I really don't want to lose this friendship, but I physically cannot afford her doing this.\n\nEDIT: To clarify, my apartment leaves the rent splint up to tenants, and the plan was for A to sign over the lease to C. If C doesn't move in, she is only technically responsible. In reality, I would have to cover it fully, or else both of us get in trouble. Breaking the lease costs 2 month's rent, so at that point she might as well not break and cover rent until October",

    "postText": "I have a big family that\u2019s incredibly close. We have big family dinners every few months where we all meet at my great grand fathers estate and eat together. Typically how this works is that the women go cook for the time they\u2019re there and the men don\u2019t. Which I am fully aware it\u2019s sexist as hell. That being said I am one of the youngest people in family and my protests mean literally nothing. \n\nSome of those women choose not to cook, however this is usually met with a level of ostracizing. The women who don\u2019t cook are lives and long term girlfriends. So they kinda already have a good family relationship doctored in. When I have seen new partners not cook, it\u2019s gone bad. Like completely ostracized, not speaking, cattiness, rudeness etc.\n\nThis dinner will be in two weeks and my girlfriend was asked if she would attend. Initially she said yes, which is great. I want for her to meet everyone and for everyone to get used to her being around, but when I explained to her the tradition she was understandably bothered. \n\nI told her that I understood where she was coming from, however it was best for everyone if she just played along. I told her this isn\u2019t a permanent thing and that I am only asking her to do this so that she can avoid bad treatment from the rest of the family. This is her first impression and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s best if we cause waves.\n\nShe told me that it\u2019s unacceptable and that if she has to do that she will not be going. I\u2019ve tried to find a compromise with her on this but she won\u2019t budge and she\u2019s pissed at me. She told me that if I think it\u2019s acceptable to make her do this I\u2019m just as bad as everyone else, while my point is that she needs to make a good first impression.\n\nAITA?",

And if they tell him to go back, insist on helping! Break the barrier *himself* and implicitly shame the other men who haven\u2019t!\n\nThat\u2019s how a similar horrible dynamic broke in my family. When I was a kid, I noticed only the women prepped food and cleaned up, so I challenged my brother and father to help. My aunt cleared my plate for me with a passive aggressive comment, and I was so distressed that my father has gotten up to help every year since then, and so has my brother. These \u2018traditions\u2019 aren\u2019t set in stone.",

My mother told me ot was woman's work but they stayed and helped. Guess what? That shit stopped happening.",

Because it is better *for only him* to keep the status quo because he is the only one benefitting. Of course he wouldn't get up and help the women! He is comfy on the couch! It really doesn't take that much effort to forget his \"non sexist values\" because he is rewarded when he does. When *she* conveniently conforms, she is swept up into the kitchen to do all the actual hard work of making meal. \n\nI wish more men had your mindset, to actually think to challenge the status quo. Because apparently when women ask men, in op's eyes, they are just being difficult and creating problems for themselves.\n\nYTA",

Sometimes children get roped into this dynamic) and it's awful.\n\nI honestly wouldn't mind helping out in the kitchen, I like having something productive to do while meeting new people, it helps avoid awkwardness. But if my partner was sitting around socializing while I was helping HIS FAMILY cook HIS FOOD I'd be beyond angry. Especially since then the majority of my early interactions with the family would be without him there, I'd feel abandoned.\n\nEither they both help cook, or they both go socialize. Or maybe they both put together a hostess gift or something and count that as their contribution.",

I grew up in the 80s and 90s in a traditional family where the women were housewives and the men worked outside the home, and, yes, at family gatherings the women cooked and cleaned up. But even then, it would have been unheard of to expect a woman who was meeting the family for the first time to participate in the cooking. This isn't a custom, it's a hazing ritual/test. The OP may not even realize this, but the women in his family have to deal with all sort of crap; it's definitely not \"just this once\".",

I'm Algerian and it's pretty much the same (well, except there's no drinking).\n\nEdit: Jfc reddit. The point of my reply is that the US isn't the center of the world on which every culture, traditions and gender roles are based on. (I also never said we attended such events or followed these traditions. Heck. We're poc lesbians, even worse lol). These structures of women cooking for weddings or birthdays or parties while men don't do anything is fairly common. I seriously do not see where I say I approve or that there's nothing we can do about this.",

He would start doing things like this. \n\nGrandma: Xtrawolf please come help with the dishes.\n\nBoyfriend: Oh let me help! Xtrawolf you stay here. \n\nGrandma: Oh no honey, you're a guest!\n\nBoyfriend: *already putting hands in soapy water and looking for a sponge*\n\nI bet you can guess how this turned out. The men of the family didn't even notice he was gone. And every single woman in my family absolutely adores my husband, and comments that he must treat me so well. They even tell my cousins, \"You should get a boyfriend like him!\" I am very much not the favorite in my family so it's hilarious to me that all 3 of my grandmas are absolutely smitten. \n\nSide note. I can tell you exactly why the women in your family resent other women who don't labor in the kitchen with them. It's because they want that freedom to relax a little too, and they're jealous. \n\nMy best recommendation to you is to take your girlfriend to the kitchen, have her sit down and chat with your family, and YOU do some dishes or food prep work. That way she is not trying to socialize without you, her safe person, being around. And her \"share\" (although she should NOT have a share of the work!) is being covered by YOU. \n\nI can't believe you have to have it spelled out for you like this, but - YTA if you ditch her in the kitchen to work with strangers while you wander away to go shoot the shit with your male relatives without a care in the world!\n\nEdit: Since people are asking about the 3 grandmas - one is a relative that we call \"Grandma\" but she's not my biological grandmother. My husband also has 3 grandmas - one of his is a step-grandma. You can never have too many grandmas!",

And if I get up he goes with, if I do not he might go instead. Because both families roll like this and it\u2019s pretty gross and we don\u2019t want to rock the boat and not be helpful, but also want to break the mold and show that better men exist, which is pretty fuckin easy to show them up, as most, as I\u2019m sure it is in your family, will have not moved an inch as the women clean up everything too. \n\nOP I guarantee that at least some of the other young women in your family resent this, and resent their fathers and uncles and brothers for being okay with this. You have done nothing because it benefits you, most of you have allowed this behavior to harm women in your lives and seemingly ruin relationships which getting up to help is basic. (Edit to add: basic FOR ALL OF YOU)\n\nYou should all be ashamed of yourselves, because being okay with this is not fair and is not partnership. You most of all for inviting a guest on the stipulation she works. Because that\u2019s what this is, it is unpaid and seemingly unappreciated labor of women. Not to mention that it seems to be so radically be part of this scenario that the other women mean girl any woman who bucks against it?? At least you warned her of that, stupid as your request giving the warning is, because if you brought me in to this without warning and I was treated this way *and* you did nothing? I would be goooone. I love cooking, but I\u2019ve got enough of this attitude in my family I would not date or marry into a family like mine  with a partner who rolled with it as you clearly have done. \n\nIf you have 9 men at a table and a 10th is a nazi and joins them, and none get up when he comes along, you have 10 nazis. The same concept applies to the misogynists at the table in your family which *you* have not metaphorically (or physically, to help) left the table from. You are not an ally to women, because when this happens, whether it is your partner or not, you have rolled with the status quo and done and said nothing. Learn from this, and do better. \n\nApologize to your girlfriend. Apologize to the young women in your family. And if you bring your girlfriend? *You* help in the kitchen with her to be supportive of her, keep them from hating her, and help break this absurd tradition. She is YOUR GUEST, and this misogynistic and rude treatment is ridiculous.",

The worst thing you can do at a dinner when first meeting is permit a guest cook, clean, anything. And the burden of a first impression is on a host, not the guest.\n\nIf op\u2019s girlfriend visits my family for the first time, she is going to be sure to get the comfiest seat, teased by grandpa, and a whole specialist team dedicated to ensure her glass doesn\u2019t run out of drink (in which the family has bought 7 different juices and sodas to try to make sure she likes at least one of them). She won\u2019t even be permitted to bring her plates to the kitchen, let alone clean them, until like the third meeting.\n\nWhat ass backwards cultures are you coming from where a woman is seen as a servant before a guest?

Would that make your GF feel less odd about a dinner where the ladies prepare it? You could even do it around a TV event that the ladies in your family enjoy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other thing you might consider is hosting a party for the couples where the ladies refused to participate. If you have a large family there's lots of permutations of dinner parties you can have. Set the example by being in the kitchen and being like \"Oh hey Bob can you chop up these onions for me please\" or whatever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUltimately, this will change when YOU start hosting.",

I realized that I did write the correct judgement, but it was something else that needed fixing.\n\nEDIT REDUX: I shouldn\u2019t type while tired. My bad.",

It doesn't matter if you're the youngest or not, you are perpetuating a cycle of sexism and misogyny in your family and expecting your gf to just go along with it. You're part of the problem fella, don't be too surprised if she decides to move on from you. Alternatively, you could grow a pair and stand up for her by making it clear to your family that you think this \"tradition\" is outdated and wrong. Take your pick dude.",

They are still going to the same place but have now doubled. \n\nFormula is expensive and you say you're supplementing... your baby is still getting breastmilk but needs a little more. That's why formula was created. Your SIL was waaaaay out of line. Even if she doesn't agree with your parenting style, she has no right to sabotage it. It's the baby that will suffer. She needs to replace it all or give you the money to replace it.",

It's a cult.\n\nI breastfed for a year and was almost defeated by books promoting the notion that there is no such thing as low supply.  I had plenty of milk most of the day but my supply was indeed low in the evenings.  That was not in my head, it was REAL, but they are not above mind-games.  \n\nI recall the trauma of my evening \"failures\", crying because I'd come to believe the formula was poison and I was poisoning my baby.  Obviously I woke up to reality eventually.",

She wants my baby dead.\u201d It was so satisfying.\n\nEdit: oh shit! I forgot to add. Apparently this girl tried to openly complain to the mods of the group and one replied \u201cidk, sounds like you want her baby dead.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m child free, but if ever I weren\u2019t, I\u2019d damn sure want to be on that group lol",

When asked for an apology, I said I was sorry her baby had an asshole for a mother.  Later I thought she was probably trying to find a way to be homophobic without publicly looking like one.\n\nOP is NTA and, like others have said, she should threaten to file a police report for theft.  Maybe get the co-parent involved in the report.  It's been awhile since I had to buy formula, but I remember spending upwards of $25 USD per can, so I can only imagine what that must be where OP lives, especially if it was a specialty formula.  Also, even if parents help out OP with formula and nappies, I'd still enforce the rule until you're fully repaid within a set amount of time.  Brother and SIL are saving money reusing things, then they can cough up money to repay you.",

My wife was in tears a lot when he was younger with trying to breast feed because he would nurse for hours and get basically nothing, and was in the 1st % for weight gain (so 99% of other babies were doing better than him).   \n\n\nWe started doing formula and stopped trying to breast feed at all after about 6 months, and now he is into 10th percentile.  \n\n\nFed is best. You are right, the 'breast is best' type people are almost cultish sometimes. This mentality has also literally killed babies. My mother is/was a nurse for 4 decades and has handled thousands of babies. She said the teaching on this evolved a long time ago and too many people have not caught up, and the mommy group people sometimes really hold things back and hurt the children.  \n\n\nI cant imagine someone throwing away OPs formula. We buy the 'big cans' and its about $40 each unless they are on sale. We sometimes have bought 4-5 at a time if they DO go on sale. If I came home and they were all gone i'd lose my shit... whoever did it would be replacing them all or we'd be going no contact.",

I've not been able to produce enough milk for him and we had to start suplimenting with formula. You'd have though we were feeding him rat poison the midwives reaction to it. They put a huge amount of pressure on me to only bottle top up where it was absolutely necessary and carry on with the breastfeeding. I was crying so much every time they lectured me every other day in their visits about breastfeeding. I felt like an utter failure of a mother because I couldn't feed my baby, but I kept trying because I couldn't stand them shaming me for formula feeding. \n\nThe result was our little man's stomach shrunk so when we gave him a normal bottle feed for his size he was bringing it all back up again and getting none of the nutrition. He'd lost a huge amount of weight (he's still not back at his birth weight but he'd lost a load of the weight he'd been putting on)and was not healthy. It took four days of slowly increasing his feeds and anti sickness medication in hospital to get him back to taking a bottle for a baby his size. He's now formula fed on a strict schedule and I've told the midwives if they have a problem with that then I don't care anymore. Fed is absolutely best, and I feel awful I put my son through all of this because of their pressuring and comments. I'm glad he's on the right track now though, taking his bottles happily, and putting the weight back on. He's looking a lot healthier too.",

I tried for about three weeks, but when one feeding time brought about a humongous meltdown from me because I couldn't stand not making/having enough milk for the baby, my husband said \"Dont do this to yourself.\" and we switched immediately to full formula. \n\nIt was a night and day difference. I hadn't realized that I had lazered in on breastfeeding, pumping and making enough milk. I cried at every feeding, I feebly pumped after trying to put her to me. It was truly awful. Still, I got push back to keep trying. But it drastically improved my life and my baby's life to stop trying. \n\nFed is best, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",

Women are not incubators and dairy cows, they should be able to have some actual say in what happens to their bodies. Breastmilk might be the absolute ideal in that it is made specifically for that individual baby, but the difference is not great enough to force/pressure/shame a mother to do it if it affects her negatively for whatever reason. As long as babies are fed something that is meant for babies their age, it is fine and people should shut the hell up.",

I stuck myself to my pump for a solid 2 weeks triple feeding (where you breast feed, then pump and offer a bottle - which is incredibly time consuming and awkward) and never saw a supply increase. I power pumped for multiple weeks (where you spend an hour straight pumping with very short breaks) *while also feeding on demand*, and still no increase. I tried every supplement I could get my hands on. I tried different pumps too! I got a virtual Lactation Consultant ($$$) *as well as going to the hospital breastfeeding group 30 min from me 2x a week* and nada.\n\n2 months in and the LC at the breastfeeding group said, \"You might just have low supply.\" \ud83d\ude10 What.the.actual.fuck.\n\nI am *so glad* I spent my maternity leave stressing out over all of that shit  instead of enjoying my baby.....I will *never* breastfeed again.",

Contact your pediatrician and local lactation consultants for advice on where to get formula to tide you over. They may have formula samples on hand.

For the sake of peace, try and inform her that you will no longer be accepting any unsolicited advice from her nor interference. I had to set that boundary with a lot of people. Being a mother is hard enough without having someone shove their beliefs down your throat. It is also absolutely necessary that she replace the formula as your baby needs to eat. Your brother and her need to figure something out and please please do not let this go so easily as this is your CHILD we are talking about &amp; not just a random misunderstanding.",

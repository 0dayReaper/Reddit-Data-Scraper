My advice is get some cheese, crackers, nuts, peanut butter, trail mix, and a variety of bagels, cream cheese, pudding, yogurt,  granola bars, and  frozen meals she can pick from. Get the cheese pre-sliced so all she has to do is walk in and grab. That frees you from snack prep duty.",

Eggs and avocado is a great breakfast choice because thae fat and protein combo keeps me personally from getting hungry for at least 6 hours. If I've a busy schedule that's my go-to. Plus it keeps your brain focused on your work instead of getting distracted by hunger after two hours.",

That's not going to cut it\", but then I recalled OP mentioning the vomiting and food related nausea. It may be that proteins right now are off putting to her. I assume they know about balanced meals and it's already an additional food-related stress factor when you have trouble eating but are hungry fast, too. I'd recommend talking to a dietician to see if they've got any suggestions.",

My first pregnancy (angel baby) I wanted ice cream from McDonald's. Hubby ate the top and I legit sobbed about it. Second pregnancy I craved warm chocolate chip cookies (hubby had to go at 2am to Walmart to get the cookie dough and make them) and even then I hardly shared. He did this about 4x but 2x in the same week before covid shut everything down.\nMy youngests pregnancy I didn't crave much besides a tuna sandwich from subway but I hate fish so I never got it. Still think about that sandwich and it's been over 2+years.",

However, most of us manage to work full time jobs, some have older kids, some are single parents, and none of us have the physical household workload of someone even 50-100 years ago as we have machines to do washing and hoovering, etc.\n\nShe\u2019s being demanding like a toddler because Op is pandering to it. He should stop. Poor Op is going to have two babies in the house soon.",

You can\u2019t convince me that it\u2019s not a big deal that a woman\u2019s body is literally growing another doesn\u2019t take a toll. And that\u2019s just such a crappy take \u201cwomen have been experiencing pregnant forever, no crap and it not all glitter and rainbows. I\u2019ve met more women who have had difficult pregnancies than the glowing ones. I swear people love telling pregnant women to suck it up and it\u2019s not a disability, like yes you shouldn\u2019t act like a princess, but this isn\u2019t your average person. It\u2019s a person growing a damn human. I had two high risk pregnancies and one very complicated birth, and what I\u2019m not going to do is invalidate anyone\u2019s pregnancy just because women have done it before or had more to handle. Because either way pregnancy takes a hell of a toll.",

Perhaps your usual diet doesn't include what she needs to build another little human and sustain her strength. That, and her weakness from the hyperemesis, could be preventing her from being able to identify exactly what she needs to eat.\n\nPlease get yourselves some books from the library or online so you can learn more about nutrition during pregnancy.\n\nAs an example, in other threads, we've read about pregnant vegetarians craving meat. This is just an example of the body needing increased and better nutrition for this process.\n\nOnce your wife gets better nutrition, she'll feel stronger and should be able to do more of the cooking. You can both also look for solutions for other issues as her pregnancy progresses. Exercise and fresh air are also important.\n\nI had a healthy pregnancy, exercising and working until the week before my daughter's birth, but I'm a well-fed Canadian and was fortunate enough not to have much morning sickness.\n\nIn another year or so, you'll also need to research nutrition for your little one as they grow to need more than breast milk.\n\nAll my best to your family!\n\nNote: Mom also needs prenatal vitamins that include folic acid to prevent neural tube defects.",

Two minute noodles (but not using the flavouring packet) boiled up with some green peas, and then a small scoop of peanut butter and some siracha mixed together for the sauce [if she doesn't have a nut allergy, and you can remind her that PB has healthy fats she and the baby needs, and there is some science showing that baby's who's mother's had a lot of peanuts and nuts during pregnancy have a lower risk of a peanut or but allergy]. I would also serve this with either hard boiled eggs, a bit of shredded chicken, or a frozen salmon fillet (I could buy these frozen in individual portions for pretty cheap, and if you chuck it in the oven at the same time as putting the point of water on to boil for the noodles, it should be cooked through by time water boiled and noodles ready - and again, healthy fats, and omega 3's strongly recommended for in pregnancy, and salmon is known as a lower mercury fish!)\n2. Mashed potatoes (either white, or sweet, or a mix) with brown gravy and some peas - yes it's carby, but her concerns about carbs and startch may be from diet culture opinions which you need to make clear are NOT RELEVANT any more now that she is pregnant and during both pregnancy and breastfeeding if she does). I would make a big batch of mash, then freeze portions in ziplock bags, use a sachet or quick gravy mix, whole thing could be ready in the time it takes a kettle to boil\n3. SALAD however not a boring low protein salad, but a salad with some green leaves especially kale or baby spinach for iron, some sort of citrus dressing or maybe segmented oranges etc depending on the season, and chicken breast, and also some drained white beans or chickpeas! (You can zap them in the microwave if she prefers them warm). Hits all the requirements for a healthy meal and is pretty quick if you already have some precooked chicken, and also helps with her nutrient needs.\n4. Some kind of fruit crumble or fruit pie or cobbler dessert - it adds a bit more nutrients cause of the fruit, and sometimes just need that sweet hit and also the comfort food factor! Serve with ice cream or custard.\n\nI know she's being a bit nutty, she absolutely is clearly driving you both mad, and I'm sure she does appreciate your patience with her this far as it is - but also remember that you need to keep your nutrition and mental health up too cause you're gonna want some stores of patience and such for later! (Also NTA)\n\n(Also if any of these work, the month before she's due to give birth, prep the FUCK out of anything that was suitable, or double or triple batch when you're cooking. Cause there's no time to really cook after but having stuff in the freezer quick and ready to go will make all the difference for you!)",

Fats are very important - try adding avocado, olives and olive oil, more nuts, and fatty fish like salmon. Eggs more often too.\n\nShe also probably needs a lot more micronutrients that we don't eat a lot of normally, like zinc. Liver and oysters are excellent for this, though they aren't everyone's favorite, they are extremely nutrient dense. Try some pate that she can snack on with crackers, and there are some good tapenade or dip recipes using oysters that are pretty good if you don't usually like them. I can't stand them myself, EXCEPT in a dip with other strong flavors. I like it that way and it's very snacking friendly as well",

In real life, only one person treated me worse because of my pregnancy, and he had a LOT going on with his own life (autism, being a teenager, homeschooled, high anxiety, bully victim). It just shows me that the people who are upvoting comments like that probably have their own problems and struggles.",

            "comment": "OP, you mentioned you eat meat or lentils and milk and bread for breakfast. I think she may not be getting enough protein. She is growing a human being using resources from her own body. She needs something of substance at every meal now that she can stomach it. When I was pregnant, I found meat harder to stomach especially if it's greasy. Try citrus marinades for red meat like lemon garlic or chicken too. Bright, acidic flavors like citrus, berries, etc really helped with the near constant nausea. She also needs calcium rich foods to replace what the baby takes.  As well as a source of omega-3 preferably from fish (not mackerel, tuna, etc known for having too much heavy metals), essential for brain growth. She is also right to avoid too much simple carbs. Pregnancy diabetes is quite common and avoiding too much carbs definitely helps. \n\nSome of my favorites while pregnant were:\n\n- Minestrone soup with italian sausage and a slice of crusty multigrain bread.\n\n- Plain Greek yogurt topped with fresh fruit and a light drizzle of honey. If having for breakfast, I had a boiled egg or two as a snack later to keep full longer. \n\n- Vegetable omelet with favorite cheese and a simple spring mix salad.\n\n- Nicoise salad but replaced tuna with salmon. Sometimes had tuna but not often due to concerns about mercury levels in tuna. \n\n- Soy marinated grilled chicken, steamed broccoli seasoned with some salt and sesame oil, and rice.\n\n- Baked spaghetti but replaced some of the noodles with spaghetti squash. \n\nAs a snack, try kefir smoothies with frozen bananas and a soaked pitted dates for sweetness. I sometimes added a little plain cocoa powder for a chocolate flavor. Oh and a spoon of plain peanut butter for a peanut butter chocolate rendition. These were my go to for a filling snack because it was easy and delicious like a yummy shake. \n\nAlso, if you can find Japanese sweet potatoes, wash and scrub them and pat dry then bake at 325F for an hour. Really nice sweet snack. \n\nYour wife is likely feeling very sluggish and heavy. It's exhausting growing a human inside you. I was napping a lot and I never napped before. She is working like you on top of being pregnant and that can take a toll. Glad to see you're stepping up but it would be nice to see you take more initiative in talking to her and planning meals. Planning what to make is half the work. Im the main cook in my home. I take preferences into account but I dont wait around for my family to tell me exactly what to make. I just do my best and I think thats what your wife is wanting. \n\nHope this helps.",

                                    "comment": "Excellent advice. Too many choices can be overwhelming and decision paralysis is an absolutely genuine reaction, stemming from anxiety. Keep it simple, but the choice is between two hearty meals - period. What you said about splitting dinner into two meals is a bit concerning in terms of portion sizes. She needs to be eating more calories than she did pre-pregnancy, period.\n\nCarbs are not the enemy, period, and this is absolutely not the time to focus on a highly restrictive diet. It may well be that your wife is struggling to think straight and make decisions due to a lack of calories and complex carbs throughout the day. It may help to have toast with peanut butter or a small bean and cheese burrito an hour or so before deciding what to have for the main meal.\n\nI would also encourage you to talk to your wife about what\u2019s eating *her*. Is she afraid that if she gains more than ten pounds during pregnancy, she\u2019ll become morbidly obese and hideous to herself and to you? Has she ever struggled with an eating disorder? \n\nIs she going out with you, with friends and family? Vomiting once a week is not a reason to isolate yourself from the world. Does she have a favorite restaurant? Have you stopped going there since she developed morning sickness? \n\nSome of the behaviors you\u2019re indicating are concerning for both the mental and physical health of your wife and in terms of ensuring adequate growth of the baby. When is her next OB/GYN appointment? You definitely want to be there and make sure to ask about calorie and nutritional requirements in a curious, non-judgmental way.\n\nEvery pregnancy is different, but I think there are early warning signs here that suggest something else may be going on that needs to be checked out, both by a physician and a therapist. If your wife is completely resistant to this idea, even posed as preparation for adjusting to life as new parents, I\u2019d be very concerned about how she will function during the post-partum period, home alone with a new baby all day.",

My baby-girl is nearly 5 weeks old; I had horrible, horrible nausea (vomiting 8+ times per day every day) literally until the 36 week mark and she arrived at 37 weeks &amp; 3 days. So I was *constantly* hungry because I was, ya know, supposed to be *eating for 2* and had to be medicated in order to keep the victuals down\u2026 I frequently had no bloody idea what I wanted to eat, I only knew that I wanted food- *now!* So do you know what I did? I waddled my behind over to the pantry or fridge and I would stare at whatever edible things we had in the house until I figured out what was least unappealing but ok for me to eat. And *then* I put it on a plate/in a bowl and *ate it*. \n\nLook, I get feeling as though *nothing* in the fridge/freezer/pantry looks appealing and being *so freaking hungry* that it honestly feels as though your stomach is literally trying to self-digest. But I never took it out on my husband (who was amazingly supportive while I was pregnant *and* now as a dad to our baby girl) - and it sounds as though you\u2019re doing your absolute damned-est to help her.

(Ask my husband how often I would just randomly burst into tears for literally no reason).\n\nCongratulations on your impending bundle of joy- and I promise there are so many wonderful things coming your way \u2764\ufe0f",

Sometimes diplomacy fails. Since OP actually tried to talk her sister down before the scathing words, I vote her NTA. She didn't go for the nuclear option first; she did try other means of shutting down the sister. I also get the feeling that her sister has a history of tearing people down due to her tendency to turn into a mean drunk, so I imagine there were earlier failed attempts to shut her down.",

Not being able to think quick on your feet doesn\u2019t make you not an asshole\n\nBest comment on the entire topic.\n\nIs the one battle worth the war? Did his comment make his brother feel better? What if the husband leaves the sister, destroying her life. She is so angry and hurt by it, that she never talks to the asshole brother again and she stops coming to family gatherings.  Mom and Dad are now pissed and hurt, that they start to shun the asshole brother.  Extended family slowly pull away as well, as they don't like hanging out with the drama side of the family.   Was it worth it then?\n\nSo yea. You really showed her a thing or two. Gave her a taste of her own medicine. Good for you!!! But at what future cost?\n\nSometimes the better thing is to be the bigger person and not lash out. Unfortunately, my generation was raised on twitter and social media and feel they always have to lash out and be outraged and let the other person know just how they think.",

Using the number of people someone has had sex with to shame them is weird in either direction. Maybe my wife and I are strange or prudes, but I never asked my wife about her body count prior to meeting me and we have been together for 22 years and married for 19 of those years. I can't see why it would matter other than for STI/STD purposes but that could be an issue whether someone has had sex with 1 person or 1,000 people. \n\nBut, yeah. ESH for making the extended family listen to their childish arguments over dinner.\n\nEdit: I want to be clear that I don't think my wife is hiding anything or \"misleading\" me. I was 30 and she was 33 when we started dating each other, so I didn't assume virginity. I do know that she had sex for the first time during her sophomore year of college (right before her 20th birthday actually) with her college boyfriend. That came up naturally. I also know she broke up with a long term boyfriend about a year before we started dating. Again, that came up naturally. I don't know how many people she has been with total and don't really give a shit. If it comes up then it comes up but it's not something I need to know and I wouldn't feel lied to if the number was higher than I thought. It's not my business.",

When you tell a person that you\u2019re still a Virgin you\u2019re immediately hit with \u2018the eye\u2019. They stare at you and critique you like \u201cyea their nose IS a little big I guess...they\u2019re pretty socially awkward so I can see why\u201d etc. trying to make sense of what\u2019s \u2018wrong\u2019 with you that no one wants to have sex with you \ud83d\ude44\n\n\u201cI feel like once you have sex you\u2019ll feel differently\u201d \u201cThats so CUTE-it\u2019s  good that you\u2019re waiting because you should make it special- I didn\u2019t and I totes regret it so really this is a blessing in disguise\u201d etc. \n\nit makes you feel like a little kid trying to sit at the grown up table. \n\n\u201cOh you aren\u2019t missing anything trust me- it\u2019s better to wait anyway\u201d etc. just a ton of patronizing comments that all in all make you feel \u201cless than\u201d which is exactly what slut shaming is meant to do. \n\nIf the sister didn\u2019t want anyone to poke at her past then she shouldn\u2019t be delving into her brothers lack of one. \n\n\u201cBeing a virgin isn\u2019t a big deal\u201d the sister said it because she clearly feels like it is and she wanted to invalidate her brothers voice. That was the whole point of her comment. His opinion (in her eyes) is \u2018less than\u2019 because he\u2019s a virgin. \n\nI feel like most people don\u2019t understand what it is to be told that you\u2019re less of a person/less of an ADULT because you haven\u2019t stuck your dick in someone/let someone stick their dick in you. \n\nIt\u2019s a very degrading concept.",

She also wouldn't have decided on a partner whom she has to pretend to be someone else around. I'm not saying she should have had a problem with her past, but she does. Maybe she regrets it and hasn't come to terms. Maybe she truly loves this guy and opted to lie rather than make herself vulnerable with the truth. He could have very well rejected her from the get-go, but if she were secure in herself, she would have realized that it's better off this way. Point is, it's a sore point for her. And she KNOWS that her brother's virginity is a sore point for him. I'm sure she also KNOWS that she turns into an intolerable person when she drinks. But she does it anyway; she is not considerate of other people's feelings despite people being considerate of hers. Until one of them finally got tired of it (OP). I too voted NTA.",

Your sister was attacking him for no reason, and prob knew what she said was going to hurt him and his confidence quite a bit and get under his skin (not only that but as a guy that\u2019s a very embarrassing comment to say in public to someone)  You dished it back to her to defend your brother. And honestly two wrongs doesn\u2019t make it right but if your sister is gonna say something so personal and hurtful that she more than like knows is personal and hurtful she got what\u2019s coming to her. Your brother definitely appreciated it.",

Your sister's a double asshole for lying to her husband and reverse slut shaming your brother. \n\nSometimes you have to tread the line between being the asshole and not, but you've walked that fine line admirably. \n\nIf she wants to embarrass him for not having sex why is she ashamed of having so much sex?",

Her wrong doesn't make it right for you to talk about her sex life. It also doesn't help your brother's confidence at all. If everyone knew about your sister's past, why did you attempt to use that info as an insult? You must know she doesn't feel great about it.\n\nEDITED to make it really clear that I am not saying sister did nothing wrong. She acted like a royal asshole. That's what ESH or  \"everyone sucks means\". The sister may have received a fitting \"punishment\" in some people's eyes, but I don't think OP's family and brother-in-law deserved to be embarrassed in front of the extended family like that. I also imagine it embarrassed the hell out of the younger brother even more. Two wrongs did not make a right in this situation.",

My mom told me during my senior year of highschool if he starts paying after me and my brother move out wed get to split what he pays and it go towards what we need. Well recently she told me he payed her 1k in child support so I asked if I could have 500 cause I wanted to buy sum stuff for the puppy I want to get for my bf. I didn\u2019t tell her the reason just that I wanted it since she said Id get to split it with my brother. She asked me who told me that and started acting like she never said such things like she always does when it comes to these things like when I remind her of things she did when I was younger. But anyway she started acting like I was rude to ask for any of it because \u201cshe payed for so much through my childhood\u201d and this was to make up for a bit of it. I told her that isnt what we discussed back when I was in highschool and thats selfish of her not even to offer me sum of it. She then said well I half to pay bills and I spent my money to gamble. I just spent the rest of my day ignoring her messages and I know longer answer my calls from her to this day only respond to messages if they are important but I keep a nice attitude towards her in person. I feel like an ah for asking but I really wanted to get this puppy stuff asap instead of buying it piece by piece and it set me off she isn\u2019t managing her money well enough to pay her bills. She also blames me for moving out and not paying a big bulk of her rent anymore. Worst part is she's moving in with my dad to take care of his mom. So now she wont have bills to pay because hes paying all them. Shes helped me alot with my new apartment and its great but she isnt sticking to her promises. Im losing trust with her everytime I talk yo her about anything dealing with money because she always makes jokes of how she now can save up and buy whatever she wants. I even recently have been helping her stop gamble as much.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

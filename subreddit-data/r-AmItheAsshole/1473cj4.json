The place was an absolute tip. I also said that my family member lives on the same street and that his young children shouldn\u2019t be seeing or hearing about this sort of stuff. \n\nHe said he wanted ti stay until the start of Autumn but I said you have 2 months to leaves. He said his other friends wouldn\u2019t have done this to him and as far as he\u2019s concerned this would be the end of the friendship. I know for a fact that since then he has been doing drugs in the house.\n\nHe has since found another place to live and has been in the process of moving out. It has happened a lot quicker than I expected. \n\nQuestion: AITA for kicking him out?",

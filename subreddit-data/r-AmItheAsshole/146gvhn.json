Some of them improved over time as I called them out, others didn't. One went down the alt right conspiracy theorist rabbit hole - and we're in *New Zealand.*  \n\nIf you have the energy and you are safe, it's good to call them out. Not just so they know their behaviour isn't acceptable, but also so the people around them know it's not acceptable. I didn't call out my old boss for being homophobic because I thought he'd become a better person over night. I did it so that the people I worked with would know that what he was saying wasn't okay - and so that anyone who witnessed it and was in the closet would know that they had someone in their corner. Because that's what I wished I had when I was young and figuring myself out.",

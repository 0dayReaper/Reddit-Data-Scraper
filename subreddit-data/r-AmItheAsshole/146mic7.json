    "postText": "So I 16 m have regal unlimited passess one for me and one for my mom. So whenever me and my friends want to go to the movies we usually use my passes, but now here is the tricky part. I was told that me, my best friend E, his younger brother ( they are both my cousins. He is like my lil buddy.), and his girlfriend who I am friends with go to watch spider-man together. Thing is I also had plans to go the following day. The friend I was going with also had passes and we already purchased tickets for the movie. Then the day before I text him to make sure that his girlfriend told him what was going on. He then tried to tell me that we actually were going on the same day as the other person. I text his gf to ask her. SHE HAD NO IDEA IT WAS HAPPENING. Like none zilch, zero, nada. She had been the one to suggest the idea of this in the first place.  So I tell E that I can't go to the movies anymore because of preexisting plans.  He starts with this passive bull \" why are you going with him and not your bff and cousin.\"  I  tell him that it's because that me and my other freind already had plans. That he ended up being the one to want to change things when the plan had been in place. Then he says that the other guy should also bring his girlfriend. at this point two people would need to buy their own tickets. Now we could go to a different non regale theater but the only one in like a 10-mile radius isn't the greatest. Also the middle schoolers who go there were pretty annoying the last time I went. So I tell him I can't go at all. He makes a snarky ass remark and says that he'll just go another day. I end up telling him that I'm not going to cancel on someone who again we had made plans a week out to go on a different day because he had to go a different day. The reason I forgot to mention is becasue he was suppsoed to go to her house after the movie. Plans he made two days before and no one thought to tell me.",

Plus, it's your movie pass, so you get to decide who to go with. He can go see the movie another day. It's not worth going to a worse theater and dealing with annoying middle schoolers just to accommodate his last minute change of plans.",

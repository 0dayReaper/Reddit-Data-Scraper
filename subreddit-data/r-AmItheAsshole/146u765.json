Why is it his responsibility to drop his plans that he probably spent a long time organising, because you locked yourself out?\n\nI presume you have actually tried to do something other than sit outside the house pouting that he can\u2019t come to the rescue? Others on here have given numerous solutions: go to a caf\u00e9, call a locksmith. Go and get the keys from him so that he can still experience what he organised\u2026 why haven\u2019t you done that? Do you not like him enjoying anime or something, is that why you\u2019re trying to get him to come away? Your reaction kind of gives me that impression.\n\nFYI, if you\u2019re old enough to have a husband, you\u2019re old enough to be able to communicate your emotions and control them so that you aren\u2019t \u201cacting cold\u201d to someone you supposedly love because they don\u2019t do something instantly to solve a problem that you caused yourself. I would go as far as saying withholding affection to make a point of being upset - when you could either a) accept that you messed up and move on, and do one of the above options or b) explain that you\u2019re upset (irrationally, I might add) - is abusive.

BUT, if this has happened several times in the past (which is implied by your comments), you should have learned how to avoid locking yourself out by now. You can\u2019t expect people to be available all the time to help you with issues due to your irresponsibility.\n\nThat being said, your husband is also an AH. He was only 15 minutes away and could have driven home, 30 minutes out of his day, to help you out. I accidentally got locked out of our house once (wasn\u2019t my fault - I told my husband not to lock the door because I was taking our dog out for a quick walk and he accidentally locked it out of habit when he left for work). By the time he got to work, I called him letting him know I got locked out. He immediately came back home, no complaints, he was just glad he could help. I would have figured out something else if he wasn\u2019t able to come back home. Probably would have walked to a cafe or something. I\u2019ve also helped him in similar situations too (e.g. if he forgot something he needed for work at home). Marriage is a partnership, there\u2019s a balance between expecting unreasonable things from people and also being a team player.",

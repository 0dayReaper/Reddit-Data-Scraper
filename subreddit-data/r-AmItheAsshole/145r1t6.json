Work got mold in the ceiling and walls from a roof leak and I was having hives and trouble breathing every single day. They insisted they didn't have a problem. I spent well over 1k on home air purifiers and deep cleaning in case it was my house. One day at work I ended up in the er and having to use an epi pen. They kept me 3 days (it was bad), I stayed home a month after that, the symptoms went away and I never went back to that job. Mold in a house/building can absolutely kill you. (And I've never had those symptoms again)",

Getting a car is expensive. Everything needs to be shipped to the islands and so the cost of everything is much higher than it would be on the mainland. Also the cost of getting rid of anything like cars and appliances is Big because they need to ship it off the island.\n\nAnd, NTA. Mold is no joke.",

The first winter we spent in that house, both the furnace and the wood burner had to be replaced, and so did the AC unit, which the sellers \"didn't know about\" (the furnace). The plumbing was messed up, and for quite a few years if the toilet didn't stop running, and you didn't jiggle the handle, the toilet would overflow. Finally though a few years ago, mom got a neighbors help to fix the issue with the septic system. But all in all, it could've been a much cheaper house to buy had mom done a home inspection probably idk",

But now though it's at least a liveable house and it's in pretty decent shape after mom fixed everything. It was built in the 1960s I think?

With black mold, the selling price will be drastically reduced, as you know, so the realtor\u2019s commission would be significantly less.\n\nIf you anonymously email the realtor and they are as unscrupulous as your mum and bf, they can just say they didn\u2019t receive an email and they didn\u2019t know. \n\nSo\u2026you could watch after you send the email and see if they update the listing to reflect the mold and other issues OR, send an email to the realtor and also send an email to the governing body over the realtors.\n\nIn your case this is probably the state\u2019s real estate commission. Also, now that I think about it, also send one to the home office of the real estate company that the agent works for.\n\nThere are plenty of unscrupulous realtors, and this goes above them. The company would certainly not want to get sued. \n\nYou would be doing a good thing, OP!",

I don't know if your state has a similar requirement, but if your mother lies and the inspector catches it, she will be in serious trouble.

None of us (her kids, family etc) think it\u2019s a good idea. They\u2019re both around 50, have worked minimum wage their entire lives, have absolutely no savings at all aside from a couple thousand they put away from income tax this year, and have absolutely no game plan. \nNot to mention I keep hearing shout how Hawaii Natives **do not** want people moving there. And Rick is a self centered jerk who thinks he\u2019s better than everyone and can see him going over there and looking down on others there and it just not going over very well.\n\nNow to the big issue. \n\nThey just put their house on the market. And I found out they purposely didn\u2019t disclose any of the issues with their house. Everyone was told to mind their own busines, it\u2019s *their* house and they\u2019ll \u201cdo whatever they want\u201d. \n\nI think that\u2019s severely messed up. There\u2019s many \u201csmaller\u201d issues like the connected garage\u2019s foundation is cracked all the way through, electrical problems/plugs that randomly overheat(?)/turn off, plumbing issues/leaky pipes. But the kicker is **there is black mold all through the outer walls of both bedrooms and all through the floor in the kitchen**. There are spots in the kitchen where if you step a certain way your foot will squish through what\u2019s supposed to be a linoleum floor. \n\nI know how toxic black mold is and I\u2019ve heard about how ridiculously hard and expensive it is to get rid of it and how damaging it is to the property. \n\nWell my mom and Rick are aware that if it\u2019s known that they have black mold it\u2019ll *drastically* lower the price they\u2019ll get for the house and a bank may not even finance a loan for whoever would want to buy it, or they\u2019ll have to pay out of pocket to fix it themselves before relisting the house.\n\nAs I said they work minimum wage and have no savings so they can\u2019t afford to get rid of the mold, so they plan to clean up the walls in the bedrooms so that you can\u2019t see the mold and pray to god the inspector doesn\u2019t find the mold in the kitchen floor, and scam whoever is buying the house into buying a toxic black mold infested house.\n\nI think that\u2019s severely messed up and I know it\u2019s not really my business but this just adds to the many problems I have with that mother of mine and I really want to call the realtor in charge of their listing and tell them about the problems in that house. I want to make sure she can\u2019t take advantage of some poor person trying to buy her toxic house. \n\nSo WIBTA if I called her realtor and let them know what\u2019s wrong with the house so that whoever buys it isn\u2019t blindsided?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "postText": "This time last year husband Andrew and I both lost a good friend, James, from an unknown heart condition. We supported his partner Emily as much as we could but gave space when she needed (came over only when asked, helped when she asked but brought over supplies regardless).\nEventually Emily went back to work after grievance leave and asked us to look after her dog, a pure Cavalier King Charles, while she was away for work. This dog is neurotic! Whines continuously, has to have things a certain way (eats tied back, meal cooked exactly, bed in the same way, picked up and dropped off every day (sleeping at ours, home during the day)). Basically it's spoilt.\nWe said sure, we will help. Did so twice, regardless of the impact on our family and our 2 large dogs and our son. Each visit was a week long.\nThe third time within 4 months we hesitated. We didn't like this dog, but we did it to help. We also had plans. So we said no.\nImmediately we were blamed for being bad friends and not supportive. That James expected better from us, and other petty stuff too long to post...\nWe loved James. He was my big brother from another and gave me solid advice as well as being Andrews best friend. However we have been blocked on everything since. \nIt has just hit 12months since he passed, but I cannot help but wonder\n..did we dodge a bullet or AWTA?",

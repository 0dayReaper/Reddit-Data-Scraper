I 15f live with my grandparents both 58 due to family issues. A couple of months ago it was my grandma's birthday but for me, it was also a school day and I had a really tough day. When I came home I was very stressed and ended up having a panic attack in my bedroom. I just wanted to be left alone at the time. My grandma came into my room to check on me and I kept telling her to leave me alone and to please leave, my sister tried to get her to leave and told her I would talk when I calmed down. To this, she said that it's her house and she can stay if she wants to, at that point I wasn't in the right headspace and yelled at her to get out. She then grabbed my phone and threw it at the ground smashing it and started screaming at me. I don't exactly remember all that happened after, but I do know after some yelling she decided to take my door off the hinges. I regret saying it but in the heat of the moment, I yelled that I hated her and called her a bitch. She got extremely mad at that and after a lot of arguing, it ended with my punishment being that I was grounded till she deemed otherwise(which was a little over a month) and I lost the privileges to my door till I was ungrounded to. Now she keeps bringing up that I ruined her birthday and I feel really bad because she was just trying to check up on me and I called her mean things on a day meant to celebrate her. My mom was visiting and my grandma is putting some of the blame on her and is not letting her visit as much anymore which I know is affecting her. My older sister says that she ruined her own birthday and she went too far, especially with the things she said to me but if I could better control my emotions none of this would have happened. I think I'm the asshole but my sister doesn't so Reddit AITA?",

Your grandmother sounds like a control freak with anger problems (smashing your phone, taking away your door, not being willing to leave you alone).  Also her guilt tripping you over a month later is very petty.",

Calling her a bitch wasn\u2019t helpful, but you were more than adequately provoked, and again, you are 15, you deserve some slack. If adults want to discipline you for being insolent, there are ways to do that which don\u2019t involve abuse. While your grandma sounds abusive.",

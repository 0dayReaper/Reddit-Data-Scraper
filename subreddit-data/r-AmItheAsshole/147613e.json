    "postText": "Long time lurker, first time poster. \n\nOkay so background: I (41F) have a (14F) child. She is my one and only everything. I've been a single mom before she was even born. Her dad (45M) has always been in the background. He can be a bit much when he drinks and so she sometimes doesn't answer her phone when he calls. Also for added background, she was born and raised in South Africa and we have been living in the Netherlands for the past 4 years. I'm Dutch and her dad is Zulu.\n\nAnyway so here's where I need to get a reality check.\nYesterday, Baby Daddy phoned me while I was at work. Told him as much. By the way he spoke I figured he'd been drinking for a bit. I told him I'm at work and will call him later. \n\nAbout 30minutes later I get a voice note, asking why his daughter isn't answering her phone? (My child has Asperger's and had worked yesterday in a supermarket and with that, had no more social battery left).\n\nI told him I don't know why she didn't answer as I was at work, even though I did know. He just doesn't believe people can have mental issues. Not 10 minutes later he put a \"None of my children talk to me\" status on his WhatsApp. (He has 4 children in total). My daughter sent me a preview of what she wanted to say about the status and I told her to edit it a bit and send it. These where her feelings. Who am I to tell her she can't express them?\n\nAs it turns out she ended up telling him of and calling him a hypocritical douchebag....yeah not her best moment. However, she talks to him regularly, but has only seen him in person twice in her 14yrs. \nSo here's where I need to know if I'm the A....\nHe called me and went off at me. \"What kind of parent am I to allow her to say that? It's disrespectful and he'd never talk to a parent like that!!!\" \n\nTLDR: I'm raising a very well adjusted teenager, whose only interested in school and work, has some neuro issues and is a big time feminist. How can I tell her off if these are her feelings???\nAITA for allowing her to express her feelings?",

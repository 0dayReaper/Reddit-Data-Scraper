Buildings are built so shoddily that you hear everything neighbors do and just \u201cbuying a house\u201d is not a viable option for most. It\u2019s a lose lose situation for everybody. So I totally sympathize with you. Hearing banging or noise constantly can really wear you down mentally and just really be obnoxious. So because I can sympathize I\u2019m gonna go with NTA. However- as I\u2019ve been told by management in the past when dealing with these kinds of issues- they just say record what you hear. Let them send them notices to try and be quiet. As much as I get the impulse to bang on the ceiling- just don\u2019t. Tell management every time. See if they\u2019ll have them put carpets down to help with the noise or some other solution.",

If you have a diagnosis that requires accommodations, you can always present this to your landlord and try to get them to install better soundproofing. You can also try simple steps to handle your condition such as headphones. but making reasonable people to be without a home to make yourself comfortable is not acceptable.",

That went out the window the first time you banged on the ceiling like a crotchety old man, instead of having a conversation with your neighbors. \n\nOr, if your anxiety is as crippling as you say, (which is something you need to work on in therapy or some form of self help, not use as an excuse, and that's coming from someone who also has anxiety) you could have led with the note, which is much less confrontational and passive aggressive.",

They are super loud and wake me up at 6 in the morning by the noise they make. I am not a light sleeper mind you.\n I have banged on the ceiling like 4 different times to try to let them know that they are being loud. When I do bang on the ceiling it is only a few hits at a time and no more than twice a day. But it didn\u2019t help because they have still been keeping me  up. \nSo I decided to leave a note on the door kindly asking for them to be more considerate because I can hear everything they are doing. (I could never hear my previous neighbors and have lived here for years) \nThey did not make any improvement so I banged on the ceiling again with a little more umph. \nThey then retaliated by playing music very loudly. I saw one of them walking up the stairs and asked if they could turn it down.\nThey did not turn it down so I was petty and played an annoying song for less than a minute and they stopped playing their music. But the other noise continued.\nI know apartment living comes with noises coming from your neighbors but it has never been this bad. \nOther people tell me to just get a house but it isn\u2019t that easy. Some have told me I am expecting them not to live and to walk on eggshells. Am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But loud and Inconsiderate upstairs neighbours are the worst. Like it\u2019s actually soul and mental health destroying to live below people who make constant noise like that. \n\nAn old fixer upper house is $1.5 million in my city (minimum wage is $16.85) and current market rent (if one we\u2019re to give up their grandfathered rental rate to move to a new lease) is over $2k for a 1 bedroom, so I get that just moving or buying a house is not always an option and I hate it when people suggest it!",

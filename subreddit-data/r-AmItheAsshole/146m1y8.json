    "postText": "We were recently informed my Dad has at most 6 months left to live. What Dad wants more than anything is to be able to come home. Currently he can barely walk, we decided instead of sending him straight to hospice to try and get him some physical therapy to see if we can get him to a point where he can come home since that\u2019s what he wanted. Dad started complaining a few days ago he was having difficulty breathing, an ambulance was called they didn\u2019t like what was happening on his EKG, so they decided to bring him to a closer hospital than his regular one. One of the doctors from this hospital called me yesterday and told me by having my Dad in physical therapy instead of hospice I was slowly t*rturing him to death. Dad only wants to come home. We aren\u2019t equipped to handle someone who can barely walk. The doctors at his regular hospital thought he would be ok getting some physical therapy so we could try to bring him home. We don\u2019t even know if the trouble breathing was related to physical therapy, the smog outside the past few days, or something else entirely. Am I an AH for trying physical therapy rather than sending him to a hospice facility?",

We had a family member with similar wishes--and less mobility--a couple of years back, and between insurance, a couple of social programs, family volunteers, and private pay, we managed to have hospice services for her at home.   It was hard, not gonna lie, but she got her wish to die at home with her family around her.     \n\n\nNTA, and I hope you can find an option that works for your family.

Also, you can start hospice at home too. You can pay home health care for as many days as you can afford. Talk to the social worker at the hospital. Eventually, yes, he'll have to go to a facility, but let him come home one more time if possible. Best wishes.",

Who is going to be doing the caring for him? Nurses will come in and out sure but ultimately there will need to be someone with him at all times to help with toilet / cleaning / movement / cooking etc.\n\nYou are NTA for trying this but the doctor is right of course - hospice is better for him.",

We hired a trained nurse as a 24hr attendant. The nurse would bathe him, feed him, take him to the loo if required. He was also responsible for giving all medicines. When Dad needed Oxygen support or IV injections, we arranged to administer them all at home. We were there with him 24x7. Anything he wanted to eat, anyone he wanted to see - whatever. He was at home with us and we were with him till his last breath. \n\nWhat I'm saying is that everything that he would get in a hospice can be arranged at home and the cost would be equivalent. Just bring him home and give him the last few days of happiness. Who knows he might live a few days/weeks longer by being amongst people he loves.",

    "postText": "I (24f) and my roommate (24f) have been living together for around 9 months now. Before we moved in we discussed what we can handle in terms of cleaning. We both knew that we had different standards of cleanliness, but I didn\u2019t mind as she made sure to stress that she DOES clean, just maybe not as often as I do. I\u2019ve realized how much she mislead me and how often she takes advantage of the fact that I am a bit of a \u201cclean freak\u201d. I do dishes every single day, because I always like to have a clean kitchen. For months now she\u2019ll throw a few dishes into my mix and I end up doing them because I can\u2019t remember which are mine and which are hers (especially since all of the kitchen items are mine and I didn\u2019t mind sharing them with her). I never wanted to be petty so I\u2019d just clean them, but mostly because I just wanted the kitchen to look nice. I\u2019ve gotten incredibly tired of this, so I decided enough is enough. I started separating her dirty dishes from mine, and I\u2019ll wash mine around them and leave hers in the sink. It\u2019s been two weeks now that her dishes have piled up without washing a single thing. Not. One. Thing. I thought about asking her to clean them, but figured it\u2019s not my job. We\u2019re adults that should be perfectly capable taking care of the spaces we share with other people. I feel guilty and like I\u2019m doing something wrong by not just cleaning them up. I struggle with severe anxiety and confrontation hasn\u2019t been the easiest thing for me. I\u2019ve brought up dishes in the past but nothing has changed. Am I being an asshole by doing this in silence instead of just asking her to do them?\n\nSide note: This goes deeper than just dishes, it\u2019s every inch of our house that I clean weekly and she rarely lifts a finger to pitch in. I am moving out in September, so how do I make it through these last few months without making our living situation uncomfortable? I know I fucked up by letting this go on for as long as it has\u2026",

As someone who\u2019s been in your exact position, all that happens is you silently build rage and resentment until you burst and things just get worse or the friendship is ruined. \n\nJust have a sit down and calmly explain why it\u2019s important to share responsibility equally and draw up an outline of shared duties.",

The other day, my sister made a comment about my hair (something along the lines of \u201cDid your hair always look this weird?\u201d) and I snapped back basically saying \u201cdid your belly always look this big?\u201d \n\nMy sister has put on a bit of weight recently, and got really mad at me for bringing it up. She claims I went too far. I\u2019ve always been a bit chubbier than my sister so I thought she would realise I wasn\u2019t saying it maliciously but it really annoyed her. AITA?",

Actually, when I have dinner with my grandparents, they always insist on paying and they always insist on inviting every relative, friend and acquaintance in a 100km radius. So it ends up being 12-20 people. \n\nThey\u2019re also quite old and running low on disposable income (they aren\u2019t hurting and will drop 50k on crazy vacations every year, but that\u2019s where all their extra money goes - which is great, they\u2019re late 80s and should blow their money on whatever they want.) \n\nSo, they have all these rules. It has to be a cheap place. No appetizers. No alcoholic drinks. Sharing where possible (eg, pizza.) I do appreciate the generosity, but I\u2019d much rather just get what I want and pay for it myself. Or at least start a second tab for my \u201cextras,\u201d but they\u2019d insist on paying for that too. So I\u2019m left eating what I don\u2019t want and fretting over how much the final bill comes to. And I suspect they\u2019re lousy tippers. \n\nAnd in case you\u2019re wondering, they will fight anyone who tries to pay. I\u2019ve seen more than one waiter awkwardly standing around holding the bill while my grandpa argues with my uncle over who gets to pay.\n\nI really love paying my own way actually, don\u2019t have to answer to anyone.",

It was a fair point, but he felt attacked in a place that is supposed to be a safe place. It was kind of a setback for him and this whole problem.",

But if you want to keep it up without getting accused of touching her things, when you're in the car, don't let your husband start driving until she shows you she has her wallet on her. You told her right up front \"I'm not paying this time.\" and she tried to push you into it. Honestly, I don't know why you keep going out with her. Cancel. Or insist your husband pays. Like, what does he say about all of this? Because he needs to have a chat with his sister about how she's abusing your generosity.\n\nNext time she stays and says there's a reservation: \"Oh, hey, I hope you guys have a nice time. Yeah, I'm not going. I'm getting tired of someone who isn't my husband continuously trying to fuck me.\"  \n\n\nETA: In regards to OP's edit, Amy, your SIL couldn't badmouth you if you didn't give her plenty of ammo. You're saying she's badmouthing you? She's just telling people what you did. If you feel some kind of way about it, that means you're aware that you done fucked up. Stop being mad at other people for reacting to your shitty behavior. Change your shitty behavior. Grow as a person.",

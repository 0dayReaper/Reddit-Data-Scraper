Honestly, it sounds like your aunt was trying to defend you from being kicked out. I don't know that you need to be this offended. \n\nShe's on the outside looking in, and doesn't understand your dynamic with your mother. (It doesn't sound like getting kicked out was ever in the cards - it was just an incentive to get you to move on the chore.) From this perspective, you might even thank her for her concern about you, but let her kindly know that it's really not necessary. \n\nNAH",

This is my first post and I\u2019m a little nervous. For this I\u2019ll be using the first letter of the persons name. \n\nI (22) and my mother(48) still live together after some abuse and kicking out by my father. I have ADHD/ADD and possibly ASD and I find in hard to clean my room(mind you it\u2019s usually pretty clean) without help. A few months ago my mum gave me an ultimatum about cleaning me room which was, \u2018clean it or find somewhere else to live\u2019, which I was fine with. Mum and I agreed that it was gonna happen and that\u2019s okay with me. \n\nMy mum told her side of the family and they all agreed with her for the longest time and offered me help to do it so I wouldn\u2019t have to move. This ended up with mum helping clean up my room and helping me set up a time table for when I clean it. I know this sounds childish and weird, but it is a big problem for me and mum knows that and she\u2019s helping. \n\nAnyways, back to the point. My aunt, L(44) was agreeing with my mum until about 2-7 days after the chat. L sent my mother a 5-6 paragraph message about how my mum is being an a-hole towards me and kicking me out seems abusive. She also said how much my mother was acting like my father. It made my mum really upset and she didn\u2019t talk about it for weeks. \n\nMum told me a few days ago about everything and showed me the message. Everything inside the message really hurt me and hurt my mum. Most of it was so awful and I\u2019m not sure how to act around my family again. Currently I have L on mute for everything she can message me on and I don\u2019t want to reply, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right thing to be doing. Every time L\u2019s name comes up on my phone I get annoyed and a little pissed off. I\u2019m also scared I\u2019ll be mean to her as well\n\nAm I the a-hole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

For the second part, I would say you should have reached out to her and tried to come to an amicable understanding that this is something you want to do, not just something being forced onto you. Waiting for her to reach out to you, then considering ignoring her is an AH move. Even if the worry is misplaced, she is just worried for you and trying to stand up for you.",

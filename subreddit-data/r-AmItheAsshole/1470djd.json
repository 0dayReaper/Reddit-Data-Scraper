    "postText": "I (27M) live alone. My brother (21M) and his girlfriend (19F) still live with our parents as they can't afford a place of their own. His gf is currently pregnant with him in 4 months.\n\nMy brother asked to bring his girlfriend for dinner in order to catch up and I said sure, why not. However the moment she entered my house she started complaining about the smell of the steak I was making and said just the smell alone makes her nauseous and she can't eat this. I tried to suggest an alternative, but she was dead set on Chinese food and ended up sending my brother to the nearest mall in order to get her some. I thought that would be the end of it, but after going to the bathroom and coming back, I caught her throwing my unfinished steak into the garbage. I asked her what the hell she was doing and said the smell was so strong she thought she'd end up throwing up on the floor and she needed to get rid of it and then started spraying a perfume from her purse in my kitchen. I was beyond furious at this point and sent her back to the living room and after my brother came back from the mall, I kicked both of them out with their Chinese food.\n\nMy brother tried to convince me to let them back and that I could make something else for the two of us and his gf was pretty much sobbing at this point, but I was dead set on kicking them both out. However my parents ended up being mad at me for apparently causing so much distress to my brother's pregnant gf. I told them that she literally threw away our dinner, but they said that I shouldn't have yelled at her or kicked them out as she's still just a teenager who's now getting influenced by her pregnancy hormones and that my outburst also caused problems in their relationship as she ended up sending my brother to sleep on the couch that night (even tho he literally defended her as well against me, so I have no clue how this is my fault).\n\nAITA for apparently not having enough tact to deal with a pregnant teenager ?\n\nEdit: Spelling.",

I'm not doubting that maybe the smell *was* bothering the girlfriend. And OP would have been kind to put the steak away and air out the house if the smell was really bothering the girlfriend that much. But girlfriend should have communicated: \"OP, can you please put the steak away for now...the smell is really bothering me\", or \"OP, I hope it's okay if I step out on the balcony/porch for a bit until the steak smell clears up...I've been really sensitive to smells recently with the pregnancy, and it's making me feel nauseated\".",

I'm gonna barf, I will go outside until you can pack that up. Steak and eggs for you tomorrow eh?\" and ask to do something else. That's not totally unreasonable given how absolutely disgusting you can feel pregnant, but I'd never stick my face in it and throw it away if I was a guest.

Not BECAUSE you can conceive, but puberty is a stage that happens later on in childood and usually practical bits of wisdom like not touching someone elses food is somethingalready learned at this stage.\"",

My sweet, lovely, never acted out cat marked all over my bedroom while I was out of town last week (despite a cat sitter, or maybe because of it). I spent 48 hours shampooing the carpet and $100s on air purifiers and every enzyme spray known to man and no one can smell the pee but me. But I smell it everywhere.  My head hurts, I\u2019m nauseous, and I kind of hate my sweet baby girl. \n\nIn those moment, if I could rip up my carpet or chop off his stinky feet and throw them away, I might. I literally might. I am in some kind of panic rage. Do ALL women have this?  Surely not. Am I able to restrain myself?  Clearly. But I\u2019m not 19, not pregnant, have some coping skills, am able to take medication for the underlying conditions (anxiety, depression, hormones) that exacerbate this, and am generally a smart, normal person. SIL may not be starting out from the strongest place to begin with and then we add on everything else. \n\nIf she apologized and paid for the steaks, I\u2019d let this go, as long as it\u2019s a one-time thing.",

I can even understand making an impulsive decision to get rid of it without thinking it through because it was so bothersome. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s acceptable or anything, just tracking the thought process on it is somewhat logical. Still an asshole move. What I can\u2019t make sense of is how dousing the kitchen in perfume was any less nauseating or vomit-inducing for her. The whole thing just seems like her being unreasonable and dramatic just for the sake of it.",

She had other options like go outside for fresh air and remove herself for the source of the smell. \n\nYou reacted like most people would; she threw away your shared meal. She expressed no remorse only justified herself. When creating new relationships both people typically show up as their best self. She missed this mark. You'll have another chance to connect but for now know, it is odd behavior to throw away anything in someone's kitchen unless it is one's used napkin. Best to you. New family can be both challenging and rewarding.",

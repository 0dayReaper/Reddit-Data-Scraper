Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI am a school student and I am writing my finals this week, and I used to go with my friend to do my finals, but my mother offered to take me the last two days since she will be free, and I agreed.\n\nThe day before the exams I found out that she wouldn\u2019t be taking me and couldn\u2019t because of work, the thing is I had already told my friend that I won\u2019t be coming with her since my mother could, and she said it was fine, and what got my blood boiling is that my mother didn\u2019t tell me, I had to find out myself when I asked her she answered I can\u2019t because of work, I told her why didn\u2019t she tell me before hand? She said she didn\u2019t see the problem and that my father or brother can take me.\n\nHonestly I got mad and tried confronting her but all she would respond with is cold responses as if this is nothing so I got fed up and went to my room and stayed there.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what to do although I understand why she can\u2019t take me, I just can\u2019t understand why she didn\u2019t tell me so that I make some plans so that I can at least do something, I do have a brother that\u2019s old enough to drive but he can\u2019t take me, and my father he goes to work at 8:30am and my school starts at 8am so he can\u2019t take me, and no he isn\u2019t able to take me in that time frame as he needs his rest \u2018cuz he stays up late working.\n\nSo AITA for getting mad at my mother for not telling me before hand?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Talk to her if you need something from her. \n\nOne day notice seems like plenty of time - I don't think arranging a ride from your father or brother or friend is a big deal or your mother will help you figure out an alternate transport if there's no option. Assume she found out Friday that she couldn't take you Monday and she tells you Sunday morning. I don't think that's too unreasonable a delay. You'll get to your exams.",

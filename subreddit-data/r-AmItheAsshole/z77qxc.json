It makes me insane how some parents think their little bundle of joy should be allowed anywhere, anywhen, anytime and that no never applies to them.  It's pretty clear they were going to run this horse right up to the altar.  NTA.",

Hell, I would have gone full blown interpretative dance for you, if that is what it took to get it through their thick skulls that the wedding is gonna be childfree. It's YOUR wedding, YOUR rules.\n\nNTA, at all. Yes, after all the pain and struggle they went through, after all the losses they suffered, your nephew is a miracle. But so is every child that is born. And every child can also be an annoying little shit that gets cranky and tired and bored when adults are doing boring adult things like weddings. It doesn't make you an asshole to not want cranky toddlers at your wedding having meltdowns, and it doesn't make you a bad uncle to save your nephew from the meltdowns. \n\nNor a bad brother to give brother and SIL a fucking night off away from their 3 year old. If he was only 3 months, and you were getting pissy because they wouldn't come without him, then yeah, you would be a bit of an asshole. But he's 3 years old. He can handle a babysitter watching him. Heaven help the child when he starts school.",

Keeping people from touching her chonky cheeks when we were out and about was a full time occupation. She even won a full month of free diapers in a Cute Baby Contest ( don't judge, lol. Free stuff is awesome.) As cute as she was / is, I didn't go out waving her around like a backstage VIP pass. We're bonkers over our OWN babies so that we keep them alive even when they drive us nuts. The cuteness bubble extends no further, lol.",

They tried IVF for 15 years before she was born. Mom went thru hell on her body to try to conceive but never once had she ever used that as a reason to bring my sister anywhere she was not allowed as a kid. We actually go to plenty of adults only weddings and my parents always hired a babysitter. I don\u2019t get why this couple thinks their child is entitled to go to a wedding that is NOT their wedding. It\u2019s not about the couple, it\u2019s about OP and his partner! Why would you ever insist on bringing YOUR child to a wedding and insist an exception be made just for your kid to an event that isn\u2019t even about you!? I just don\u2019t get it at all.\n\nEDIT: my apologies I was mistaken, the way my comment is worded makes it seem like they were going to adopt a child that day, but I was mistaken, I clarified with my dad and they weren\u2019t going to adopt a child, they were going to sign adoption paperwork to see if they would be approved to adopt a child that day.",

I mean idk about you but I have always felt interpretive dance accurately portrays my points. \n\nHonestly though, the fact that both the brother/SIL and OP\u2019s parents are angry speaks volume about how they all thought that nephew was going to be the exception to the rule. I think OP needs to have a serious conversation with his parents about how his brother was crossing a line with him and also his fianc\u00e9 by trying to guilt her into bending is important. If they continue to be angry about it then he can give them a choice, either stop talking about it or not go. Then for Brother and SIL just flat out give them the choice, if they want to attend then nephew is not invited but as such they are within their rights to stay home. Shit or get off the pot, is my idea. Don\u2019t let these people drag this out and ruin the wedding planning process for OP and his fianc\u00e9. \n\nNTA.

We checked with everyone who had kids that they understood, and they all agreed. We even arranged for a sitter(a close friend of ours who's an experienced babysitter with a degree in early childhood education) to watch the kids at my parents house during the wedding so they could be somewhere they were comfortable(my cousins were the only ones to bring their kids to town with them) and to come to the rehearsal so they could all meet before hand. Come the day of the wedding, I get a call from the sitter on my way to the venue asking when the kids will arrive. I'm confused because the kids should never have left, but they insist there are no kids to be found. Sure enough, when I arrive there's a bunch of toddlers in the front row wearing miniature dresses and suits. Took most of an hour and a rift that still hasn't been forgiven six years later for them to agree to kids only being at the reception, instead of the whole time. Be sure you have a plan for when they try to ignore what you say and do their own thing anyways.",

I would honestly hire security because I bet money they will try to come with baby and be like she cant do anything because we are here with baby. I say hire security and make sure they know anyone who brings a child will NOT be admitted. And you will have security there to be sure this rule is followed. Plus what you did sounds absolutely hilarious! Id be laughing my ass off if I was actually part of this entire thing. Even help with security.\n\nIts your wedding. And people have child free weddings all the time! It is not unusual. Plus it makes sure that there is no loud crying during the ceremony. Look Im all happy they were able to have a baby. But really what they want is disrespectful because its been made clear NO. CHILDREN. AT. THE. WEDDING! Id basically tell them they are uninvited if they keep this up and if they and parents keep trying to force this parents can be non invited too. Family is who you choose not who is blood.",

My one and only child (a 3 year old boy, like OP's nephew) is the result of my 4th pregnancy. Nobody besides the person I made the pregnancies with and my doctor know this. Plenty of people keep info like this to themselves. It's why people often wait til after the 1st trimester to announce, because they want to keep it to themselves if there's a miscarriage.",

I thought he would understand that I was clearly joking. But then again, he brought home the cat knowing it was sick and expecting me to nurse it back to health. \n\n2)this might make me the AHole because it\u2019s not the cats fault she\u2019s sick, and it\u2019s also not my boyfriends fault for picking her up and then realizing she was sick. But, I shouldn\u2019t have to have this heavy burden while he gets to do whatever he wants.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He took it seriously when I (25f) told him I\u2019d be angry if he saw a stray cat and he wouldn\u2019t bring it home. When he got home we got food from his friend and this cat was literally starving. We also discovered she has a eye infection, butt hole infection, and so manny mats in her hair. She ate so much food and then took a nap. After the nap, she started crying at the door and kept wanting to get out. I told him that either she is just a very friendly wild cat or she is a lost cat. We put her in our RV since we have two dogs in the house and don\u2019t want them potentially getting sick or hurt from her. My boyfriend she has to be declawed if we keep her. \n\nSince she was crying so much I was going to stay outside with her and sleep in the rv. But the problem is the tv isn\u2019t plugged in so there is no power and it\u2019s very dark and I got very scared. My boyfriend yelled and said that I just don\u2019t want to do it and he only brought her home because of what I said. I want to help the cat, but we don\u2019t really have so much money to by her medications or take her to the vet to get diagnosed. \n\nWe agreed that we will take her to the heartland society tomorrow so they can help her. I feel really bad but I just can\u2019t take care of her without the proper money. We left her in the rv with the windows open and I hope she doesn\u2019t rip up I\u2019ll the screens and carpet or I don\u2019t even want to think of what my boyfriend will say. \n\nHe told me first thing in the morning I have to do is clean up all the poop and pee if she did anything. I also have to wash all out cloths and make banana muffins as I promised him earlier in the day I\u2019d do. I feel horrible that I can\u2019t help this poor cat, but I have so much house work on my plate that it\u2019s just a burden to me. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

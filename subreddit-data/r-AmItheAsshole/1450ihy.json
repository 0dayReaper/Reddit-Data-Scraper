    "postText": "I have really long hair that goes down to my back. It's about 2ft of hair. Its always been a strong point of pride for me, because I spend a good chunk of money maintaining and caring for my hair.\n\nMy boyfriend has always been pushing for me to cut it, but recently he's been even more insistent. He handles all of the grittier cleaning in our home, since I really can't handle dust. (He does sweeping, wiping down, and vacuuming; I handle cooking and cleaning that doesn't make me interact with dust, like dishes, laundry, and some of the trash cans). But because of that, he complains a lot that he has to spend a lot of time cleaning up my hair shedding. (He says it makes cleaning take way longer than it has to). He says that even though he's responsible for cleaning, I should be responsible with my hair, and if it sheds this much then I should consider cutting it. But he doesn't want me to go shorter by like an inch or two, he wants me to cut off HALF of it, so it goes down to just behind my shoulders. I'm unwilling to part with that much, but he insists that I should.\n\nBut I really would rather not cut my hair. My nieces have both also recently started learning how to braid hair, and it's been a really fun bonding with them through braiding our hair too. I think cleaning up my hair is really just a part of the housework (along with his hair shedding too!), I don't see a need for me to cut it.",

It's EVERYWHERE. \n\nCutting won't stop the shedding.\n\nI'm highly allergic to dust but I live alone, so when I clean I use a mask, wear my glasses, and have long sleeves/gloves. Maybe try that so you can help with the cleaning more? And if you REALLY can't be around dust, then maybe just try to clean up your hair whenever you can.\n\nBut you are absolutely NTA for wanting to keep your hair. Cutting it won't solve the problem but now you'll also be unhappy.",

When the fallen hair is shorter and not that visible, you can vacuum once a day, not so with piles of very visible super long hair.\n\nOP can help clean up after herself even if she has an allergy. Buy a robot vacuum, wear a mask and swiffer occasionally etc. She's tried nothing and is all out of ideas!\n\nWho wouldn't be pissed about having to constantly clean after their messier partner?\n\nYTA u/Glad_Cause9006, you don't have to cut your hair but you're being inconsiderate by not proposing any other solutions.\n\nEdit: Oh man I'm getting the same comments over and over re its BF's responsibility cause its his chore. If BF starting making twice the amount of laundry due to a new messy hobby, do you guys think OP should suck it up and do twice the work? Or do you think BF should start helping out with the laundry or use a service to deal with the extra mess he is creating doing his fun thing? \n\nWhen a friend or partner tells you they have a problem with the living situation, you don't say tough shit this was what we agreed! You try to come up with a solution. That's the difference between living with someone you care about  vs a roommate you don't plan to see again when the lease is up.",

I do all the vacuuming and I take the vacuum apart to remove hair that gets entwined in the roller. My suggestion is to find a compromise that makes you both happy.",

Short hair takes ages to clean with a broom, you're just sweeping it from left to right and back. \n\n&gt;When the fallen hair is shorter and not that visible, you can vacuum once a day, not so with piles of very visible super long hair.\n\n...you don't need to vacuum human hair daily unless someone is actively balding, no matter the length.

Human hair is not terribly difficult to clean up; if you're sweeping, vacuuming, or dusting, the hair goes along with everything else, and requires no extra effort. It's not like OP's hair hovers about in midair, with each strand needing to be individually grabbed by hand.",

I couldn\u2019t vacuum my long hair because it would immediately clog the vacuum. \n\nFirst step before my twice weekly vacuum was to go down on hands and knees and collect most of the hair from the carpet. I needed to clean more frequently in all rooms, especially the bathroom. Even just growing out my hair from chin to armpit length this last year has made me notice it more. There\u2019s so much more of it now, not strands, but quantity because of length. \n\nNot that the boyfriend\u2019s solution is reasonable, it was annoying but it didn\u2019t double my cleaning time to clean up my long hair. I think the only accommodation she should make is cleaning up the bathroom floor every time after she brushes her hair, if she doesn\u2019t already.",

It would drive my partner crazy at the beginning of our relationship. We had to adjust- him to lower the expectations of having a home free of hair and me being extra diligent of surfaces that were a deal breaker for them. \n\nThe OP is most definitely the AH, not for not wanting to cut her hair - honestly, length won't make any difference, but for not addressing the real problem which is him having to pick up after her.

If your bf has been annoyed by this for a while and you keep brushing it off then I could see how he might start getting unreasonable.\n\nWhy don't you just take over the vacuuming and swap some other chore with him?

It was pretty disgusting.   \n\nSince you don\u2019t want to do the cleaning sounds like it is time for you to spend some $$$ on a good vacuum, such as a Dyson v10 or v11 animal model.  The hair doesn\u2019t get stuck in the rollers and the dust and hair comes out easily with touch free emptying.  It is a game changer.  I personally would challenge that whole \u2018I cannot vacuum or do housework because of dust\u2019, because I am also allergic and I manage.  NTA.",

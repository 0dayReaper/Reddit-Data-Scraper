    "postText": "One of my best friends is having her bachelorette party in Cancun,Mexico and this is my first time outside of Niagara Falls ever leaving the country and I am super excited to go.   \nI told my family this, and my older brother is like oh can you please check in on our surrogate she is in Cancun. When I first heard it I was like sure. But then, I found out that his surrogate is 2 Hours drive from Cancun and doesn\u2019t live in the safest neighborhood, and I would need to get a driver. Also the bachelorette party has a full itinerary and I am only there for 3.5 days.  \nI told my brother that I won\u2019t be able to make it and he freaks out at me, and is like you don\u2019t care about family, what happens if Mary (fake name for surrogate) house is filthy and your future niece is born sickly. He starts going on how it\u2019s not even a big deal, and starts saying what is more important having fun with friends or family?  \n\n  \nTo me it really rubbed me the wrong way, for one if he cares so much he can fly down there right now. His partner is much older and really wealthy and they go on vacation every couple months, and they just came back from Portugal, like they could have gone to check in on our surrogate . And FWIW they already have her sharing her location, and have her send a picture of each meal she eats, and they even got her a Fitbit. Like they are tracking her so much, me not checking in on her house is not gonna change anything. I know I initially said yes, but to me I feel like they are being really unfair here.",

My understanding is that's basically \"industry standard\" for surrogacy. It's to help prevent cases where a surrogate extorted money. But the ethical standards can be all over the case with these, especially if no one bothered to explain the contract before the surrogate committed.\n\nNo idea what the legal options would look like in an international case like this, but they could probably wreck her life with lawsuits if she did try to challenge the terms. Sounds like they have the income.",

In India there are literal houses/hospitals full of pregnant women having  European/American babies. The people running the organizations charge 25k and the women are given a out 5k. They do it over and over again for their families. That is exploitation.",

You so desperately want a child that you would rent a poor woman\u2019s womb, maybe even buy her eggs. Or a random man\u2019s seed. And I mean poor literally, as in \u201cneeds money so badly, she would rent her womb out for nine months\u201d, because that\u2019s who these people prey on\u2014 they are not asking a wealthy socialite with abundant leisure time and resources to carry a child. So, that to me is hugely problematic.\n\nI think part of my distaste comes with realizing women in the west are sold a big lie: put off childhood! Focus on your career! You can have a career and be a mom!!!\n\nYes, technically you can, but something suffers in the equation.\n\nPut off having a baby until you\u2019re established! And yes, wouldn\u2019t it be lovely if people were able to wait until they were settled and financially stable. \n\nThey tell us we can freeze our eggs!!! Save them while they\u2019re young so they\u2019ll be good and ready when *you\u2019re* ready \n\nthey don\u2019t talk about the cost to extract the eggs or  the toll that it takes on our bodies, they don\u2019t talk about the cost to store these eggs and definitely they don\u2019t talk about the high failure rate of in vitro fertilization\u2026 it\u2019s easy to freeze the eggs, but they\u2019re mostly water, so thawing is a different story. They don\u2019t talk about the impacts on the surrogate\u2026.the postpartum depression that many women suffer after surrogacy, or the impact birthing\u2019s child from your body and never getting to hold that child. They don\u2019t talk about how challenging it can be to get pregnant as you get older. Or that as you wait, the man whose eye you are hoping to catch\u2014 the man who is working towards financial stability and who wants a family in the future\u2014 is getting married, and the longer you wait, the higher your likelihood of marrying a man who has previously been married, and who may have children (which some women aren\u2019t interested in). they don\u2019t tell you about how the more you dig into your career the less time you\u2019ll have for social situations where you might meet a mix of people\u2014where you might meet a potential mate\u2026\n\nWhen I was younger, I viewed surrogacy strictly as the kindness of sorts\u2014an empathetic gesture: you can\u2019t have this baby you so desperately want, let me help you.\n\nNow I see it is a selfish act\u2026 not offering your body is a surrogate, but feeling so desperately that you deserve a child\u2026that the world needs you as a parent, despite nature\u2019s best efforts to tell you otherwise\u2026 I just find it kind of gross",

Even in countries where this process is strictly controlled, and not made for profit, there are still babies who end up with abusive parents, or their parents die, and there is no one to take care of them. We need adoption to protect them. \nSurrogacy, in contrast, is not needed. It's there to satisfy a wealthy couple's desire for a baby. Just my two cents.",

It grosses me out that they pay other, often poor women to do so for a selfish wish (wanting children is selfish by default and I have them myself).",

In the UK, it is illegal to pay for it so it is volunteer only, which isn\u2019t exploitation free (many of these women have mental health issues IMHO) but at least it is more equitable. However, even then, very few are rich and well educated and most come from more deprived backgrounds.",

It's easier to get older children, but you run the risk of them having psychological and behavioral issues from growing up in the system. And don't get me started on how biased the system is towards gay couples that want to adopt.  That's why a lot of people adopt from out of the country. There is however a problem with adopting from Eastern European countries because there heavy drug use among women that put their kids in the system and a lot have developmental delays and are born addicted to drugs, which you can't really tell until their older, so it's a roll of the die. It's a popular place to adopt because many families want 'white babies'.\n\nProbably the safest bet is adopting from East Asia, where a lot of kids born to single women (a big no no) are put up for adoption. For a long time it was China mostly because of the one child policy, but now I think people adopt largely from Korea.\n\nI love the idea of adoption, but it's so difficult and often time expensive. When you spend that much time, money, and effort, often times only to be denied,  you might as well get a surrogate. I don't agree with it, but a lot of people don't see a problem with it.",

My brother and SIL looked into both adoption and surrogacy, and the surrogacy was an easier, more affordable process. They were still on lists for adoption agencies when the surrogate was confirmed pregnant.\n\n I know someone who is currently trying to FOSTER and can't be matched with a child. They are specifically looking for an older kid and still on waiting lists.",

Google \"guatemala child theft adoption\" for one such case.  They tell women that they're taking away their child for education, but don't tell the women that their parental rights have been severed and the child is being sent overseas.  They tell women that their child has died, when actually the child was taken away at birth.  And the nursery takes the cash payment for the adoption and his happy.\n\nAll of these things have happened repeatedly.  In Guatemala, in Vietnam, in Russia, in South Korea.  The reason is that in a post-antibiotic era, there are very few infants without parents, without close relatives who want them, without families.",

It can creep up at any time, especially when you\u2019ve spent your entire life being fed the line of how blessed you are. \n\nAnd by all accounts, I had a \u201cgood\u201d adoption. My adoptive parents are wonderful people who could not have their own children, I was given every opportunity that a person could want, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t have issues that I can trace back directly to my infant adoption. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault but biology and neuropsychology. \n\nReunification should always be the goal. Keeping an infant with a mother and supporting her through her pregnancy should always be the goal. Mental health and addiction services should always be the goal. Infant adoption tends to be inherently as predatory as surrogacy is (including in North America) because it targets women who are backed into a corner and are told by society that they have no other choice (especially given the circumstances following Roe being overturned in the USA). If they *truly* don\u2019t want to be mothers, that\u2019s okay but if they feel as if adoption is their only option because they simply can\u2019t support a child or cannot see past the roadblocks of having a child we need to address that and find a way to help them with those roadblocks instead of feeding them the lie that giving their child to strangers is the only option. Kinship adoption is a bit of a different pickle but I won\u2019t get into that now. \n\nThe other issue with pushing adoption is that it erases other long term options. I\u2019m in the process of becoming a foster mother to two teenage girls via kinship currently. I can support them long term, until they\u2019re adults and even beyond and still not need to adopt them, and I think that\u2019s the biggest flaw in this \u201cthere are kids waiting to be adopted\u201d scenario. We can support children and open homes for them without needing to legally change their identities and past. The entire system needs to be reworked and examined under a different lens.",

A lot of surrogacy in developing countries and the global south has horrifying similarities. At the start of the war, Ukraine was highlighted unfavourably to their need for support at the time as running surrogacy farms for lack of a better word. To be legal the parents who took out the surrogacy had to collect the baby in person. 3000 babies were awaiting pick up to Western couples in the first month of the war. The majority went into state orphanages and many of the parents redid surrogacy in another country like Mexico.\n\nI\u2019m LBGTQ+ and can only assume many of my same sex peers can call cognitive dissonance because sex isn\u2019t pure like babies while supporting carceral policies over sex work and sex trafficking that encourages while totally fine with the same slippery slope in surrogacy is an issue this community will need to reckon with one day.\n\nBut ultimately like always, money, power and respectability talks over human rights. And the horseshoe diagram often puts the right and left way closer together on these issues than either care to admit\u2026",

Generally what is \u201cbetter\u201d is what is whiter and feeds into settler colonialism. What is true is these new homes are generally wealthier (but mainly wealthier through the perpetual practice of enforcing the current power structure). so the system continues to be maintained therefore perpetuating the practice which keeps it alive. I also think that the ideological roots of both this practice, the regular baby snatching of the 1950-1970\u2019s and forced sterilization are tied together. This is based on my knowledge of sociology and history but I am not a expert in the this specific subject. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: I have nothing against adoption and, yes, surrogacy done in ethical and mindful ways that benefits everyone with enthusiastic, non-coercive consent. I knew a woman that loved being a surrogate not for money (she didn\u2019t need it) but because she loved being pregnant and helping people (lot of gay couples-happy pride month) start a family. But I think all of us can agree that the picture painted here is horrific. (And not a lone wolf).",

But it is actually frightening that he would put your life in danger when people are kidnapped and murdered in Mexico all the time because of the drug cartels. Your refusal has nothing to do with not being a good family member. And if her house is filthy or she is drunk all the time, what are you supposed to do about it except to tell him and he still has to deal with her. Enjoy the party and tell your brother the US Embassy told you American citizens should not travel 2 hours away from the resort. Blame the government. Everybody else does.",

    "postText": "Ok so I\u2019ve wanted to do dance since I was a little girl, but My parents have never had the time to take me. However, my moms work hours changed and she told me she could now take me. I was so excited and began to search for dance studios when one of my friends who I\u2019m going to call Olivia, told me that I should just go to her studio because it\u2019s really cheap and I would know her there. I told my mom about this and she looked at the prices and she said that the studio looked good and that I could go there. I went to school the next day and told everyone. Everyone was super happy for me, except for my other friend that I\u2019m going to call mia. She said that I shouldn\u2019t go there. Now, mia has always been that person who would get jealous when Olivia (they\u2019re best friends) would talk to people because she said she felt left out. Anyway, when I asked her why she said dance is the only time she gets to really talk to Olivia with no one else around. She said that she never gets to talk to Olivia because someone else is always surrounding her, and that she wanted to have dance and Olivia to herself. Mia even threatened to quit if I went to her studio. I told her okay and that I didn\u2019t want to come between the two of them, which I don\u2019t but I still really want to do dance and my mom said that this studio was the cheapest and what we could afford. I really don\u2019t want to make mia mad but I don\u2019t know. So, WIBTA if i went to her dance studio?",

    "postText": "UPDATE: AITA for sleeping top naked in my room?\n\n[Original Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hlqn2c/aita_for_sleeping_top_naked_in_my_bedroom/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nHi everyone! I wanted to give an update on the situation since a lot of people were really concerned for me.\n\nAfter the whole debacle, I did purchase a wedge for under my door from Walmart . It worked, and I didn\u2019t have anymore issues with waking up to people in my face. I used the excuse that it was to keep our cat from opening my door at night and my mom seemed fine with that.\n\nWhile E was here and even after he was gone my mom seemed detached and sort of out of it. I asked if everything was okay and she said she needed to sort out some feelings first but she promised we\u2019d talk when she was better. I said okay and left it at that. \n\nCouple days later, E came back for another weekend stay. The day after he came they had an at home date night with drinks and fancy takeout, and that night I woke up to my door being messed with. I call out to see if it\u2019s my mom, and got no response. I pulled on a t-shirt n shorts and pull the door wedge out to check, and E is standing at my door. He was drunk, and I was a bit panicked because I thought something had happened to my mom and he needed help, but he just stood there for a few seconds without saying anything. He didn\u2019t seem to be sleepwalking or in peril so I said \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable, I\u2019m closing my door.\u201d\n\nBefore I could close the door all the way, my mom flew out her room, saw him, and started cussing and screaming and telling him he needed to leave. They argued back and forth for a while but eventually she got him out the door. After calming her down I took her to her room and we had a talk. \n\nIt turns out, the day she had came into my room, she had been on his phone and saw he was talking to his brother in law about me in very disgusting ways, talking about how I was growing up to be very shapely and mature, and that he couldn\u2019t wait until I moved out so he could dump my mother for me. He said far more explicit things that were all extremely worrying, especially since we\u2019ve known him since I was 11. My mom had came to tell me to be careful around him while she thought of a way to break it off safely, but when she saw my state she had some misplaced anger. He\u2019s out of our lives now, thankfully. \n\nTL;DR: boyfriend was actually a creep, mom had misplaced anger.\n\nI wanna say thanks to everyone for all the suggestions and recommendations, and even those who suggested my mom could be abusive (I plan to talk to her about her other ideals/behaviors soon). Sarcastic thanks and genuinely big \u201cfuck you\u201ds to those who sent me crude messages. I\u2019m just glad the situation is over.",

That includes shutting down convos about grooming/pedophilia/otherwise creepy as hell behavior.\n\nWith that in mind, we decided to strike a balance between not allowing this update, and a flood of \"pedo\" comments.

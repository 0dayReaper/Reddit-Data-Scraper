She didn\u2019t have a collar, she wasn\u2019t spayed and looked like she was under a year old. \n\nIt was after midnight so we weren\u2019t sure what to do or who to call. We don\u2019t own a dog, just a cat who is very afraid of dogs. My BF has always been more of a dog person (I had the cat before we met) and he was super excited to potentially keep this dog. (Looks like a boxer mix) \n\nHe started to let her in the house and I got mad because we don\u2019t know this dog! She seemed sweet enough but she looked really skinny and clearly didn\u2019t belong to anyone. Probably doesn\u2019t have any recent shots and I didn\u2019t want to take the chance. Plus she could\u2019ve hurt my cat. \n\nI suggested we leave out some water and food and a blanket for her on the porch, and if she was still there in the morning we could take her to a shelter to see if she\u2019s chipped. He said that was cruel and we had to let her stay in the house. He said he wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.\n\nI decided to put my kitty in our bathroom so she was away from the dog, but I felt really uneasy about the dog being in the house. My BF passed out but I was up all night listening to her walking around the house and barking every few minutes. In the morning I found she had peed all over my cats bed. \n\nWe took her in the morning and found out she isn\u2019t chipped. The shelter said they are at capacity and can\u2019t take her in. My BF said, \u201cThat\u2019s okay we\u2019re going to keep her.\u201d\n\nHe NEVER asked me if it was okay. He just decided we\u2019re taking on the dog. I don\u2019t want this dog. I like dogs fine but I already have a cat who doesn\u2019t like dogs and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with this. \n\nI tried to tell him that, but he said he had to compromise letting my cat move into his house so I have to compromise for the dog. \n\nAITA for not wanting to keep the dog? \n\nTLDR: my BF and I found a stray dog, he wants to keep it and I don\u2019t and he won\u2019t budge\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It was kind letting the little dog inside but confine it to a room seeing you don't know it!\n\nBased on your post it sounds like you bf didn't want a cat. But he compromised. He clearly really wants a dog, and yeah cats don't usually like dogs. But they can learn to tolerate them.\n\nRather than just saying no, why don't you put boundaries up such as \"dog isn't allowed in this room so the cat has an escape\", taking it to puppy school etc. If the dog looks like it's going to chase the cat then Def gonna find a new home for it. But give it a chance?",

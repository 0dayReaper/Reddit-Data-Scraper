    "postText": "English is not my first language and I don't live in USA.\n\nFor some contex: I (32nb) and my ex (33M) divorced couple years ago, and we have shared custody, but our daughter(11) lives with me and visits her father for two days a week. Our daughter stays at my ex's place usually two days during the week, not weekend. Partly because her father wants to participate normal life and not have her over at weekends which could cause them being \"special\" days. Partly because he is an alcoholic and at weekdays it's easier for him to stay sober and be present for our daughter.\n\nNeither of us does well financially. I'm on sick leave and maybe soonish getting on disability benefits, my ex is currently unemployed. He pays me the smallest possible amount of child support that court could legally accept, same amount the goverment would pay me if he wouldn't be able to do so.\nBehind the court's back we did a \"gentlemen's agreement\" that I pay him back the child support from the days our daughter stays with him. That lessens the amount of child support I have for affording our daughter's life below the legal amount.\n\nSince we have shared custody and our daughter stays with her father weekly, we have both bought her stuff she needs. No throwing receipts on each others' faces, who spent how much. Trying to be civil. But during some months my daughter has constantly told me how her father badmouths me to her, and whenever she asks for something (new shoes because old ones are worn out, new pair of pants because she grew out of her old ones) my ex had responded with: \"Ask your other parent, they're rich.\" \nHe knows for fact that I am not rich, I'm struggling. Meanwhile my ex has been travelling 5 days a week for months, aka all the time when our kid hasn't stayed with him. I'm a bit annoyed he can travel around the country all the time and tell his daughter he can't afford getting her any essentials. \n\nAs summer finally started I and my kid realized she doesn't have fitting summer clothes. Last summer's clothes are way too small, and winter clothes are too thick and hot. My ex once again said he can't buy our daughter any clothes and travelled across the country, and I bought for her t-shirts, shorts, and pants. Regardless of it being the cheapest shop after second-hand shops, getting her some clothes ended up costing over 200\u20ac, more than I get child support a month. \nI tried to brought this up with my ex, ask if he'd buy our daughter some clothes too so it wouldn't be completely on me, but he refused. I wasn't asking him to pay half of what I spent, nor one more expensive cloth, if he would've bought couple t-shirts 6\u20ac each I would've known he participates to the costs of keeping our daughter clothed. But no, he won't. \n\nSo would I be the AITA if I tell him I can't pay him back the child support for the days our daughter stays with him because he doesn't participate on our daughter's necessary purchases?",

Especially since he doesn't buy stuff for her, that she spends her time with him doesn't matter that much. You are the primary caregiver",

Look after yourself and your daughter! He is not your problem.\n Looking at it from a different perspective, you have helped him to fund his toxic habit by giving him more money, which should have been for your daughter! And now you are even asking if it is alright to not give it.. you like to be walked over? Just why?\nBesides if he is traveling every day as you say...sounds like he may have some income you don't know about (because how would that be possible?) I would look into it and if it is a sort of income which would be possible to prove to the court. Then that is your responsibility to do. Go to the court to recalculate the amount of support. Do not let yourself to be screwed over..",

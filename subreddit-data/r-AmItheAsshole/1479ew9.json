He was using one of his family members car at one point for transportation but that stopped for some reason. I know he doesn't have any type of bills that holds him back on fixing his car. He knows what's wrong with the car because i pointed out what it was and apparently he has the part to replace. i have offered him to use my tools.but because he has had it sitting for so long that he needs a new battery and pass due registration. \n\nI am no mechanic but I work on my cars. I have helped him once on his car before but he had no interest in learning. I felt like I was being used for my service and for that reason I dont want to help him physically so I rather help him with the tools I have. \n\nHe is a big help for me at work but he holds me back from doing things in the morning before work or after work just for me to take him home. \n\nHow would you approach to tell someone to fix there vehicle. \n\nNote: work is approximately 4 miles away.",

You don't need to explain why, defend yourself, or point anything out to him. He'll quickly figure it out when he knows you're serious. If you act like a doormat, don't get annoyed when people walk all over you. \n\nYWNBTA",

    "postText": "I was lucky enough to snag six tickets to see Garth Brooks in Vegas. \n\nMy friends and I had made plans to go as three couples. \n\nBut I can't really afford to pay for six tickets. The concert is kind of expensive. I told my friends that I needed the money for the tickets before my credit card was due.  They both promised they would get it to me. I reminded them a few times and they both \"forgot\". \n\nI called my sister and asked he of she knew anyone who might like to go. She said that her and my stepsister had been taking about going.  We decided to make it a family trip. They paid me immediately and I transferred the tickets for each of them. \n\nLast week one of my friends saw that I posted on Facebook about going with my sisters. She asked why I was going twice?  I told her I wasn't. I needed to o pay my credit card bill so I sold four of the tickets.  \n\nThey went ballistic. \n\nI do not have any credit card debt as I pay my bill in full every month. \n\nThey both assumed I would be okay just paying the minimum monthly payment like they do. They expected me to save them the tickets even though they didn't pay me. \n\nI told them both to check their texts and see where I had agreed to that. I sent them screenshots of where they both agreed to pay me BEFORE my bill was due. \n\nThey are pissed because all the tickets left are either resale or very expensive floor seats.  \n\nI am mad at them for trying to screw with my credit. They are mad at me because they had booked time off to go to the concert. \n\nAITA?",

They were mostly my husband's friends. They told me a few days before prom  they couldnt come when I asked for the rest, one  said it was because of academic probation and the administration took it away, other has excuses.  My husband split the cost with me. It really sucked for us to pay for a whole limo but we couldn't cancel. I would have lost the deposit which was not a little sum.  We ended up having the limo driver pick up my parents and take them around  for their anniversary while we were inside prom and drop them off before the driver came to get us. I didn't want to pay all that money just for it to sit outside the venue for hours. We got inside and they were there and rode in a different limo. That was one of the many  reasons why I hated about them. They are not in our lives 17 years later.",

Her husband was an alcoholic druggie with a gambling problem. After a six months my wife asked her sister for repayment of the money because we had learned they had gone on vacation and were constantly bragging about their trip. My wife was furious! Well SIL did not like being confronted and tried to make my wife the guilty party by saying she didn\u2019t need the money and that she was a money grubber. It was tough seeing my wife hear this because she has a good heart and never thought it would sour their relationship. SIL finally paid wife back a month later when she appeared at our front door to drop off the money. She never apologized just acted as if my wife was bad guy in this situation. Good thing was she never asked for another dime and she finally divorced her jerk of a husband after 15 years of marriage.",

Sorry it didn't work out this time.\"\n\nIf OP wanted to be a brat, another text could have gone, \"I hope your cash flow problems get resolved soon!\" But OP found a way to be a brat by passive-aggressively hinting the tickets were gone through public social media posts the friends had to stumble across.  That may be delicious to your typical reader here, who loves meeting rudeness with revenge, but it's still rude.\n\nNTA for selling them, but ESH because of how it went down.",

A person came by, fell in love with the car and made a firm commitment to buy the car from me. Said, nay, promised, he'd bring me cash in four days to get the car and begged me not to sell it before then. I told him I would sell the car to him. I stopped advertising the car and stopped showing it as I had his firm commitment to buy the car. When he did not show up, I called and left a message for him. He called back and said he'd had to work late and had been unable to get to the bank to get the cash (this was before PayPal, Veno, Zelle, etc) and asked if he could come by the following evening. I agreed. He no showed again. He did not respond to my next three calls and did not respond to a note left in his front door, either. The following weekend, I began advertising the car for sale again and sold it. He showed up 5 days later with half cash and a personal check and was outraged that \"*his* car was gone, sold out from beneath him without warning or notice\". Did I call him, after his broken promises and multiple unanswered messages, to let him know I was selling the car to someone else because he had not paid me yet? No, I simply sold the car. The car was mine to sell because the guy who wanted to buy it never showed up with the money. Just because he promised to buy the car doesn't mean it was his - it would have been his if he had paid me for it but until that happened, it was mine. \n\nSee how that works? \n\nAnd yes, this gentleman was a \"friend of the family\" and trash talked me to the neighborhood and some people in our church. Luckily, since it was a car, a lot of money, and most of my friends and acquaintances knew me to be a woman of my word, they knew there had to be more to the story than the skewed story he was telling. Several people even asked, in a chastising tone of voice, why I had sold the car when I had promised to sell it to him and had nothing else to say with that ton of voice after I explained that he had promised to bring me the money on two separate occasions yet did not, just as  he had not answered my phone calls and the note left in his front door. One person, just one, tried to tell me that I should have let him know I was going to sell it if he did not bring me the money but the other people in the conversation laughed and told her not to be ridiculous. \n\nWhile some people may fall for the negative things the friends who missed out on the pricey concert tickets say, the people who really know OP will either know there is something wrong with the story they are telling or approach her and ask for clarification. She is in the right and NTA about any of her actions.",

I don\u2019t think it was wrong to sell the tickets, but I think OP could have given their friends a heads up that they would have to literally sell the tickets to someone else if they didn\u2019t have the money in hand by x date. Yes, they communicated that they needed the money, but they did not say that anything would happen if they didn\u2019t get it in time. Friendships are a two way street. Maybe these friends have a history of this kind of behavior, but we don\u2019t actually know that from the original post. \n\nOP is NTA overall but I think if she had just told the friends she was going to have to sell the tickets, the conflict could have been avoided.",

So one person needs to buy the lot and get paid back by the others.  I do this all the time.

If you're close enough to take a trip like this together, you'd think you could've reached out and, at the very least, let them know instead of them finding out on FB. It reads as you not valuing their friendship. Communication is an essential component of any healthy relationship. As a friend, you dropped the ball on this. If you care about these friendships you should take accountability for not reaching out to them first (or at all).",

I spent weeks stressing, then I couldn't even enjoy the event as much because I was feeling guilty about the empty seat next to me. So many times I've had friends drop out, or pretend they've sent me money and 'it must be the bank' (why aren't you worried if the bank has lost your transfer money tho? That's a big deal!!), or ended up having to take my bf to a show he doesn't really enjoy to not waste the ticket (he enjoys seeing me have fun but is not really into the same music / movies I am)\n\nI'm done with this shit. From now on I send an itinerary with 'this is the ticket I'm buying, this is the train I'm catching, be there or don't' \n\nI hope you and your sister had a wonderful time!!",

Perhaps letting them know you were prepared to sell the tickets to other people would have made them pay up, but knowing you needed the money to pay your bill should have been enough motivation.",

            "comment": "NTA, no way, no how! \n\nUnfortunately, I am afraid you may have lost two friends - not because you did anything wrong, but because the nature of three friends is for two to not forgive the third friend whenever there is a disagreement of this sort because the two who feel wronged (noticed I said \"feel wronged, not actually wronged\" when talking about this situation) have each other to moan, fuss, complain, and trash talk the third person (especially if the friend trio if female, in my experience) and because there are two of them, they will feed off of each other. It may be even worse in this incidence because they both must know that they were wrong for not paying you in a timely manner, especially when you sent them more than one reminder about paying you in a timely manner. It will be easier for them to bond together and insist that you are wrong because otherwise, they have to acknowledge the fact that they are wrong and mistreated you by attempting to take advantage of you and then getting mad and going ballistic at you about it and apologize for their poor behavior.\n\nAs far as them being mad because they had already booked time off to go to the concert, that was silly of them to ask for time off prior to actually having the tickets! Haven't they ever heard of the old saying about counting your chickens before the eggs are hatched? \n\nI am happy that your sisters want to go to the concert and were able to pay you promptly. GO TO THE CONCERT AND HAVE A GRAND TIME!",

I suspect your \u201cfriends\u201d would have a different viewpoint if either of them were on the hook for all of these tickets. \n\nA few years ago, my wife and I decided to take a vacation with her family. While sitting around the table, we started talking about where to go and where we would stay. I decision was made and her sister volunteered to book everything. While we were driving home, she texted her sister and asked for the total of our share. A little while later, her sister sent us the amount we needed to pay along with the booking receipt showing the total price. I immediately Venmo\u2019d our share of the cost in full to her sister. It\u2019s just the right thing to do. \n\nSide note: my wife saw Garth in Vegas several years ago and said it was her favorite concert that she\u2019s ever been to. I\u2019ve never seen Garth live but would love to. Hope you all have an amazing time!",

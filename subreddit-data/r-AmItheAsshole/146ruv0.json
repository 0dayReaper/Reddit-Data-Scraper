The FIL is trying to \"control\" and indulge in our marriage, and he has always tried to control my husband throughout his entire life (his choice of education, work, etc.), so it's definitely a trigger for him. The only thing I can do here is to stand my ground and not let my cats go no matter what. I don't care if the FIL hates me, he needs to understand that he now has zero control, but I hope my husband starts to understand that I will not let anyone have control over our lives either, and yes, he needs to face his demons.",

Please advise your husband you married him, NOT his father OR his brother, and confirm that he still wants to be married to YOU, and doesn't want to go live with his father and brother.  If so, then the matter's settled: you have two cats, adoption agreed to before marriage, and those cats are going nowhere. Ask him to let his father know that.  \n\n\nAlso, get both cats chipped, do not give your husband the details, but tell him:  \n\n\n\"I'm a superstitious woman, and if some unlucky accident should befall those cats \u2014if they should escape through an open window and never seen again, or if they should be run over by a car, or if they're struck by a bolt of lightning\u2014then I'm going to blame some combination of you, your father, and your brother. And that, I do not forgive. But that aside, let me say that I swear on the souls of our future grandchildren that I will not be the one to break the peace that we have made here today by your calling your father to let him know the cats are STAYING.\"",

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI've been dating my partner for 3 years now, and 2 years ago, he encouraged me to adopt a cat. I got very attached to my cat, and it's helped me out with a lot of mental health struggles. 1 year ago, we talked to our families about getting married. Around 4 months ago, I asked him if I could adopt another cat. He said yes. 1 month ago, we finally get married. Before we finalized the whole thing, I asked him MANY times if he is okay with me keeping my cats and when moving in together if he would be okay with it. He said yes. (We still didn't move in together yet)  \n\n\nTo lessen the confusion, here's the timeline:  \n2020: We start dating  \n2021: I adopt 1st cat  \n2022: Marriage idea pops up  \nDecember of 2023: I ask for permission to adopt another cat  \nApril of 2023: I ask if he is okay with my cats pre-finalizing the marriage. He says yes. We get married.  \nJuly 2023: (We would move in together)  \n\n\nNow, his father (who keeps trying to indulge in our lives &amp; has always tried to control him) tells him that I should get rid of the cats because my husband's brother is allergic and will be visiting our home all the time, and then he continues to fight with me, calls me \"petty\" to prioritize cats over marriage and that they're \"just cats\" and that I don't have my priorities straight and that anyone else would've gotten rid of them. I tell him that I asked before marrying you if you would be okay with it. He says \"So you would've not married me for your cats?\". Nevertheless, he still had a lot of time to bring this issue up, but he did not until his father indulged. I told him I would have a very good air purifier and make sure the house is clean so his brother's allergies wouldn't rise, but he continued to argue with me, swear at me, and disrespect me.   \n\n\nI do not want to get rid of my cats, especially since I already ASKED him SO MANY TIMES and he had SO MUCH TIME to bring up this issue. (Also, his response to \"You had a lot of time to bring this issue up\" is that \"He didn't take them seriously\", and he is just asking \"to find different owners, not throw them in the street\")   \n\n\nAm I the asshole? I am very stubborn, but I just want to know if I'm being stubborn over the right thing here. Thanks.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "postText": "   \n Me - 26M, my gf of 2 years Leah 24F and our roommate/friend Ivan 27M\n\nWe all moved into our 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment 6 months ago and said we would  \n split the rent 35/35/30 because Leah and me took the larger bedroom with its own bathroom and because Leah has her cat.\n\nLeah's been having some serious health problems the last year and started a new treatment 4 months ago. It\u2019s expensive and only partially covered by insurance. I don\u2019t want her worrying about choosing between anything and her medicine so I told her I was taking over her part of rent and utilities at least for now and she could just cover our phone bill and subscriptions. So I\u2019ve been paying Leah\u2019s part for a few months. I never told Ivan. It wasn\u2019t some big secret but it didn\u2019t effect him so I didn\u2019t think it was his business.\n\nLeah was talking to her mom on the phone in the living room a couple days ago and made some comment on how stressed she was about everything and that she was lucky to at least have rent taken off her shoulders and Ivan overheard. He confronted her while I was out which was shitty by itself because she shouldn\u2019t have to defend my decisions to anyone. She was crying when I got back so I got really mad and asked Ivan wtf he did to her and he said he should\u2019ve been told about any changes. I said nothing changed for him, did he think I should pay for him too just because I pay for my girl? He got all stuttery and said no but that we should\u2019ve been honest that Leah wasn\u2019t an equal partner in this and that not telling him was the same as lying to him\n\nAnd I got mad that he would say that about her so I yelled at him to shut the fuck up and mind his own business because the rent got paid and that\u2019s all that should matter to him and not to ever give us his shitty opinion on our lives ever again. And then he called me a pussy whipped douchebag and left for awhile and came back but hasn\u2019t spoken to us at all which is good. But he\u2019s walking around slamming doors and Leah is happy I stuck up for her but said she didn\u2019t know that Ivan didn\u2019t know and maybe it would\u2019ve been better to be honest at the start  \n ",

So I\u2019ve been paying Leah\u2019s part for a few months. I never told Ivan. It wasn\u2019t some big secret but it didn\u2019t effect him so I didn\u2019t think it was his business.\n\nLeah was talking to her mom on the phone in the living room a couple days ago and made some comment on how stressed she was about everything and that she was lucky to at least have rent taken off her shoulders and Ivan overheard. He confronted her while I was out which was shitty by itself because she shouldn\u2019t have to defend my decisions to anyone. She was crying when I got back so I got really mad and asked Ivan wtf he did to her and he said he should\u2019ve been told about any changes. I said nothing changed for him, did he think I should pay for him too just because I pay for my girl? He got all stuttery and said no but that we should\u2019ve been honest that Leah wasn\u2019t an equal partner in this and that not telling him was the same as lying to him\n\nAnd I got mad that he would say that about her so I yelled at him to shut the fuck up and mind his own business because the rent got paid and that\u2019s all that should matter to him and not to ever give us his shitty opinion on our lives ever again. And then he called me a pussy whipped douchebag and left for awhile and came back but hasn\u2019t spoken to us at all which is good. But he\u2019s walking around slamming doors and Leah is happy I stuck up for her but said she didn\u2019t know that Ivan didn\u2019t know and maybe it would\u2019ve been better to be honest at the start  \n \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Then he used a nasty term to describe your caring for your gf. Sounds like a misogynistic bully finding an excuse to attack and look down on the woman. His passive aggressive silent treatment is childish.",

You do come across in general as the AH here though because of how you are talking about the various people involved. Lily is 2 years younger than you, she is not a \"little kid\" and you are being dismissive and toxic. I get that it is hard to get to know your mom's new partner but you could at least be respectful towards a fellow teenager that has lost their mom.\n\nAlso making your mom having given a gift to someone she wanted to feel welcomed all about you was unnecessary.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy (16F) parents have been separated for about four months and my mom (39F) started seeing Jason (44M). I don't know how serious their thing is but I suspect they are boyfriend-girlfriend. I don't personally know Jason much, my mom usually does not bring him to our house, but he seems cool. Two weeks ago my mom told me Jason was coming home and we were all going to have dinner together. Jason brought his daughter Lily (14F). He talked a lot during dinner about himself, kinda boring. Apparently he is a fancy doctor, I had already assumed he was wealthy because of his car and clothes, and had a wife before but she died or something.\n\nHis daughter was mostly quiet which was for the better because I don't like little kids, they are annoying. Later that night, my mom was showing Lily her make-up and jewlery. She offered her to take something from her old box. She grabbed a ring and came to show it to me. My mom told me it was her old engagement ring my dad gave her but she hadn't use it in years. I complained about Lily getting a gift while I was left empty handed. My mom said the ring was cheap and ugly anyway to which I agree but that was not the point. Jason reacted fast, took off his watch and gave it to me. It was golden and metallic, it looked nice but it was too big and heavy for me. I still accepted it and ended my protest.\n\nLater, I looked online and found out that the watch is really expensive (around 150K). I wanted to sell it but my mom said I couldn't handle so much money. Jason says he never cared about the watch because it was gift from work and didn't even knew it was so valuable. My mom said that I have to wait until I am 18 to sell it or otherwise she will take most of the money. I have been wearing it all the time, really uncomfortable, to prevent my mom from taking it from me. She says she wouldn't do that but is afraid someone is going to hurt me trying to stole the watch. I told her that then she should let me sell it without restrictions and we have been arguing about this a lot.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

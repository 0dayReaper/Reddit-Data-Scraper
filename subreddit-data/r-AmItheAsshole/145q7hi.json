    "postText": "So, I recently became official with the lady I\u2019ve been dating for 6 months. We decided to have the first BBQ of the nice summer weather in our area at her place (we don\u2019t live together currently). She decided to make steaks and baked potatoes, and I made some side salads and I also was responsible for the drinks and chips. As my girlfriend got cooking, it just panned out that she ended up plating and serving to people as her steaks finished resting. When I went over to watch her plating, I noticed she had put butter and herbs and stuff all over the steaks. My family doesn\u2019t do this and I\u2019ve never seen it done this way so I asked her (politely) if she would put mine aside and I would do my fixings (I just want my steak with ketchup, I\u2019m pretty plain). Both she, her sister, and her Dad gave me very pointed looks. \n\nLater that evening she said she felt that it was rude to the \u201cchef\u201d (her in this instance) to ask for my food separately and that she wished I would have just trusted her to make me a nice plate of food, and that I shouldn\u2019t do that when I\u2019m a guest anywhere. I fairly commonly politely ask for my food to be made differently/more plain when I\u2019m a guest somewhere or at a restaurant because I generally prefer plain food. I didn\u2019t think this was rude. \n\nAITA for asking for my own food to be served differently outside my own home?",

I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the asshole for asking/expecting a host to make my plate differently upon my request.

It\u2019s very possible he was rude about it or they haven\u2019t talked about it, but it being a surprise enough for her to be upset about it is kind of giving me pause. \n\nTo be fair to her I guess, my friend who I mentioned before didn\u2019t really twig the food thing until around the 6 month mark, because there were some things he would not eat and she got annoyed by it - so they talked! And she made the decision that she could cope with him not liking certain foods, she could still make and eat them herself. But it has to be talked about or it becomes a problem in a new relationship. \n\nNot everyone wants to be in a relationship with an autistic person with these kinds of issues (a \u2018food thing\u2019 is never going to be the only point on which the autist is quite rigid and particular/weird), and that\u2019s cool, but the only way you find out if it\u2019s a dealbreaker is by actually talking through \u2018things\u2019. (Personal anecdote: my most obvious aspie thing is I cannot eat with a fork that has uneven tines. They must be even or I cannot bring myself to eat with it. Low key drives me kinda mental. I can mask with the best of them and genuinely seem neurotypical, but if I\u2019m at dinner with family/friends and my fork is uneven, I give the game away immediately because I have to swap it \ud83d\ude05 I\u2019m a rather mild case and I\u2019m female/diagnosed as an adult so I got more masking practice than most, but it totally ruins my mood and dramatically shortens my temper to have to \u2018just deal\u2019 with uneven tines. Someone who has it any worse than I do is very unlikely to be able to handle a specific \u2018thing\u2019. Men are often significantly worse at masking too.)",

When he saw it he asked if he could have his plain instead. It's only a big deal because people are making it a big deal. \n\nA side point that doesn't matter, he wasn't just a guest attending someone's event. He was co-host. They might not live together but he supplied all non-bbq fare, (the side dishes, the snacks, and all the drinks). The person doing the cooking wasn't a stranger hosting him, it was his girlfriend who he thought he could talk candidly with. \n\nPersonally, I think he should have tried his girlfriends steak prior to dismissing it, to see if he likes her cooking style. Not because asking for his to be plain is just outageous and not to be entertained at a bbq. From her reaction we can tell she is proud of her steaks and thought he'd enjoy them (that or she just feels slighted in front of her family and is upset about that). But until the steaks got a cooking for the first time, neither realised preferences was gonna be an issue for the other.\n\nI'm gonna say NTA because he didn't realise asking for a plain steak off the bbq was going to be seen as a slight by her and her family; until it got hostile. But I kinda think the girlfriend knew her guy always asks for plain food, even at restaurants, so she could have gotten ahead of \"this situation\" with communication.",

Please.\n\nI'm just gonna say this once - leave adults alone about their food preferences. I have 50 years of frustration at being looked down on for being a picky eater when the taste of certain foods are just downright unpleasant to me (and yes, I've tried it, I promise I've tried almost everything multiple times. It still tastes like shit) I cannot be more passionate about what I am saying.\n\nPeople get to have their preferences and as long as they don't expect others to go out of their way to accommodate them, they are fine. And no, asking his gf to not put seasoning on it is not asking her to go out of her way.",

It wouldn\u2019t even make sense to make this a rule given the vast spectrum of what different people *in the same culture* find polite not even considering differences *across* cultures. \n\nAlso, some folks have big sensory issues with food, and they shouldn\u2019t have to give a 20 minute Ted talk about autism and food aversion for someone to show them the basic respect of not forcing them to eat herbs just because it\u2019s what the other person likes to do. You never know why someone has a preference, and it\u2019s not your business to force them into doing things they dislike or are uncomfortable with just because it\u2019s under your personal definition of manners. \n\nAll you have to do is say \u201cokay, thanks for letting me know\u201d instead of making it some big weird ego thing\n\nETA: Also, it\u2019s worth questioning why you find this offensive/annoying. Is it because you were treated that way after voicing a preference as a child? Do you make cooking a part of your identity? Do unexpected changes make you anxious? Are you intolerant of difference? Like why? Why is it such a big deal? Why is it so important to satiate this need in yourself to the point you need someone else to mask their own discomfort?\n\nSecond edit: and I just saw that yes, OP has autism.

Like...I don't know what metrics were used to determine that medium-rare is the best way to cook a steak, I'm not going to argue it or say it's wrong. But what I **do** know is that (prior to going vegetarian) **my** metric was \"meat cannot have an uncooked texture.\" I was not able to eat a medium-rare steak. It would make me gag.\n\nSo people can argue about steak being \"wasted\" by \"overcooking\" it, but if the person cannot eat it or enjoy it, isn't that a bigger waste? Who cares if the person wants their steak cooked medium-well? If that's how they enjoy eating it, then it's not a waste.",

You're now 6mths into dating someone and in a committed relationship. Leaving aside that is autism not something to be ashamed of and thus hide, your choice to hide it anyways will start feeling like dishonesty if it hasn't already.\n\n And seriously, your autism is affecting that relationship. That is evident of you having to post here. So this \"no one can tell\" nonsense your mom is telling you is a lie; your girlfriend can see the impact on you, she just doesn't know the reason.\n\nTo put it simply - every time you ask for an accommodation, you just look picky or rude or difficult *because* your girlfriend doesn't know it's an accommodation.",

Only since being with my girlfriend have I realized my food is as plain or \u201clow quality\u201d as it is.",

I agree that when a cheaper steak is cooked very thoroughly, ketchup is the only way to get it down. Ketchup is compensating for the flavor and texture. That\u2019s how I ate it as a kid too. But when someone is cooking a higher quality cut of meat, it has a really good flavor and texture that you might really like. Putting ketchup on expensive steaks is sort of equivalent to\u2026 I don\u2019t know, paying for a movie ticket and then spending the whole movie on your phone reading the plot summary and spoilers instead of watching it. Or wearing nice shoes someone gave you as a gift to do yard work. It\u2019s effective but it misses the point, and someone might get their feelings hurt. \n  \nIt is very rude to put your own seasonings on something someone else cooks for you before you try a bite of it. You implied that your girlfriend is a bad cook in front of her family. \n  \nAfter you tell your girlfriend about having autism, find a way to try steak the way she cooks it, without an audience.",

Personally speaking, when you know the background of WHY people behave as they do, it can help a lot in a relationship (smae goes for maybe being on the spectrum).

It isn't telling the chef to run inside and rustle up a bowl of pasta carbonara; it's just asking her not to season his steak -- it's actually easier for her to do this than to season the damned steak.\n\nIt worries me that GF is unwilling to make this simple accommodation to the OP's food preferences.  And that she'd criticize him for expressing his preferences.  (It's not like he went, \"Ewww, gag me with a spoon.  Butter on steak!  Disgusting!!!

Oh and I think it's not about how you like steaks :D :D\n\nOP says he is on the spectrum, so I shall be very detailed and explicit on the social stresses I think may be going on here. Note that if course I am extrapolating and projecting significantly here, but since my main advice is talking to GF ad nauseam, the true answer is offline anyway :)\n\nYou have been seeing each other for 6 months, but are only official recently, so this sounds to me like you are the first time hosting, and on top of that, her family is there, and you, a guy in a heterosexual couple,  are 4 years her junior . there is nothing actually anything wrong with the age thing, it's just less common, as Ms are perceived as maturing slower than Fs, so it just heightens everyone's attentions being paid. \n\nWhen I meet a friend's or siblings significant other, all I care about is how they treat my friend or sibling. And the interaction you describe would easily fit the any-signs-of-disrespect I am looking out for. Actually, the use of the term 'serving' in the title already rung my alarm bells. Bluntly, you interacted with her like with a food worker at a buffet. Nicely and politely, but not on social currency, but as if it was her job to prepare the food to your liking.\n\nIf I was her dad or sister in this situation, I would not like that at all, as it would hint at an unbalanced relationship (a bit like - you are an entitled little kid, seeing her perhaps as a servile mum-replacement, now an equal partner) and think less of you for it.\nIf I was her, I would be feeling embarrassed, knowing that what I just described was going through my family's head. And I would already be stressed because I am dealing with all these food things and all those people interactions, and my newly-official BF doing something unexpected that paints our relationship in a light that I don't like, and presumably isn't true.\n\nNote that in none of this it matters what your intention was, but how it looked to other people, as this was likely not a 'just chilling' social situation, but one where she had something to show/portray/perform regarding your new relationship.\n\nMy recommendation is lots of direct talking to each other. That is based on my experience as a somewhat socially anxious person having been in a relationship with a person on the autism spectrum. Like, if we went into a situation that I found already tricky or that I vulnerable in and we didn't game-plan it before, you bet I got stressed and annoyed by something they did that made the situation harder for me, while they were rather clueless about what was going on. \n\nHowever, by putting in the work ahead of time, game planning and coming up with some code words to signal to them explicitly what was going on in my perception/head (I wanted them to know but not the other people involved), we navigated the situations as a team and made both our lives easier than they were without each other.\n\nTL;DR: talk it out in detail until you fully understand what was going on and then turn the need for all that talking into a superpower and thrive from here on out :)\n\nOh yes, also do try that steak with butter and herbs, sounds delicious!",

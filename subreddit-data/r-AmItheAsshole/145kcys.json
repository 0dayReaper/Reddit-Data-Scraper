    "postText": "For context I'm a 21 year-old female college student and I want to go to florida with my friend. I'll be paying for the vacation myself and I brought up the idea with my parents who are very strict. I'll be going with another girl and not doing anything crazy. They got angry and called me a bad person. I've never traveled alone and want to have a vacation after working hard at college. I feel like they always said no but I thought if I paid for the trip myself they would finally let me go. I feel like this affects our relationship a lot since I've missed many opportunities to hang out with friends.",

It is wrong. \n\nIt also sets you up to really appeal to abusive partners in the future. They've raised you to be controlled. \n\nSadly, your best bet is to skip this vacation in order to get your last year of college paid for as it sounds like you feel it is worth it to you.  (If you decide otherwise, get a loan.)\n\nThe good news is this means you have a year to plan and prepare. Do whatever you need to to ensure you will be financially independent upon graduation. Take the opportunities they cost you to socialize to make extra money. \n\nThen go LC or NC. \n\nIn the mean time,  if therapy is available at school, consider it.  Your parents have robbed you of opportunities to adult and make decisions for yourself so it's best to start learning asap.\n\nOnce you graduate, return to therapy as soon as you can as you will very likely need help dealing with your parents. They have been overly controlling your entire life so it is reasonable to expect that they will handle your independence poorly. Support will be so valuable to get through the transition. If they elect to disown you, that's ok. It is just another effort to control you which is unhealthy and just plain ugly behavior. In time you will see the loss is entirely theirs. \n\nI'm so sorry your parents have failed to do right by you. Look forward to gaining your independence and cutting out the toxicity.",

If you were a financially independent adult it really wouldn\u2019t matter what they thought about how you spend your money. Live your own life however you want.\n\nBut you aren\u2019t an independent adult quite yet. If you can afford a vacation, you could afford to put that money toward your tuition. If your parents had paid that much less on your behalf they could be the ones taking a vacation!  For however long they\u2019re paying your way through life, expect them to have an opinion on what you spend \u201cyour own\u201d money on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut it sounds like this is about more than money.\n\nIf they\u2019re judgmental and controlling (trust me, I can relate) work toward getting out from under their control. Money is a HUGE part of that. If that\u2019s your goal, this vacation might not be the best use of your resources.\n\nYou don\u2019t have a moral obligation to follow their rules forever or to limit your life experiences to the ones they find acceptable. if you\u2019re wanting your parents\u2019 approval, which is a totally normal thing for children to want even after they reach adulthood, \u2026I can\u2019t really say \u2018cause I don\u2019t know your family, but- you might never get that no matter what hoops you jump through trying. (Speaking from my own experience.) It\u2019s normal to feel guilty when our parents disapprove of us, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we\u2019re doing anything wrong. Too often, people let that feeling limit their options in living their best life.\n\nThe emotional support part is kind of a separate question from the financial support part. But ask yourself if taking this vacation is worth possibly losing their financial support at this moment in time. Consider the bigger picture. You\u2019re NTA for wanting this, but it\u2019s something only you can decide if it\u2019s worth fighting over.",

I'll be paying for the vacation myself and I brought up the idea with my parents who are very strict. I'll be going with another girl and not doing anything crazy. They got angry and called me a bad person. I've never traveled alone and want to have a vacation after working hard at college. I feel like they always said no but I thought if I paid for the trip myself they would finally let me go. I feel like this affects our relationship a lot since I've missed many opportunities to hang out with friends.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

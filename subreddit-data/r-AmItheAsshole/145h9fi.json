    "postText": "Okay so about 2 months ago, my fiancee was out with her girlfriends for the whole day. When she went back to her home at night, it's a habit that we call and tell each other about our day. So I told her about my day and then I asked about hers. And she just blanked out. I told her to take her time to remember, because she will eventually since it happened a couple hours earlier. She just couldn't. I found it REALLY odd that she couldn't remember what she did a couple hours ago, but I let it go and we moved on.\n\n\nYesterday we were on a phone call and I just said a joke about how she forgets things easily. She laughed but asked why I said that. I referred to the incident that happened 2 months ago. She said that it's true that she really forgot what she did. I said yeah I believe it now, but at the time that made me really suspicious and I thought you just didn't want to tell me where you went for whatever reason. She got really sad because I said I got suspicious of her. She then went silent. After a couple minutes of silence, she said that I didn't trust her. I just re-explained my situation and asked what she'd think if someone just forgot a chunck of their day. I said \"don't you think that forgetting what you did a couple hours ago is a bit weird, and should be at least concerning?\". She said no, and thinks that it's normal. I then said that I didn't think it was normal and sounded a bit off to me, that's why I felt suspicious of her. She said I made her sad.\n\n\nWe usually communicate well in our relationship, so I did apologize to her and made sure she didn't sleep while sad/mad. We're good now. I just wanted an extra set of minds to judge the situation with me and lmk if I was an asshole or not. Thanks!",

I understand blanking out but it is a little weird to not even remember things like \u201cwe went shopping/we went out for drinks/we hung out in friends house\u201d. That\u2019s a reasonable thing to be concerned about at the time. \n\nI can also understand why she\u2019d be upset that she thought you didn\u2019t trust her. No one\u2019s an AH here. \n\nIf you usually communicate well and it was just a one off situation I think it\u2019s weird the comments are assuming things about your relationship, but oh well, that\u2019s Reddit for you I guess.",

You didn\u2019t ask for a play by play on dates, times, convos, and places. Yes, days can be boring and can be forgotten days later. But a simple me and the girls grabbed drinks isn\u2019t a complex thing to forget. And she\u2019s never forgotten anything before then so yeah suspicious. The same way you didn\u2019t make her apologize for forgetting or being sad, you shouldn\u2019t apologize for how you feel or your brain/thought processes either. She knows she either has an issue she needs to let you be aware of regarding her memory. Or she did something untrustworthy and is trying to flip the script. But if you are ok with this \u201cepisode\u201d of hers, don\u2019t bring it up in the future.",

She can\u2019t dismiss your concerns, accuse you of not trusting her, and try to shut the conversation down because she is sad. You were within reason by being suspicious of her \u201cforgetfulness\u201d. Her pretending you\u2019re out of line and jumping to thinking she\u2019s untrustworthy is suspicious in itself. If her memory is a problem, as a soon to be married couple, that needs to be figured out. It can be a symptom of something dangerous or can lead to something dangerous. Do you plan on having kids one day? You can\u2019t just chalk life up to forgetting your child in the car on a hot day, leaving them at school or daycare because you forgot to pick them up, or forgetting to monitor or feed a young child. She needs to seek medical/professional help for that. Ultimately, she needs to do one of three things: 1) accept she is forgetful and not pretend she has no clue what you\u2019re talking about and get help if needed. 2) tell you she isn\u2019t ok with these nightly check ins because she doesn\u2019t want to tell you about her day, pretending to forget and being silent doesn\u2019t solve the issue or 3) be honest about what she did that day if she plans to continue with the nightly conversations. Those are all things to sit down and discuss as a unit planning to get married. You shouldn\u2019t constantly bring it up if you\u2019ve agreed to let it go. But if it\u2019s an issue for you, she needs to know that and you need to be honest. She can\u2019t shut down a reasonable concern by saying she\u2019s sad and saying you don\u2019t trust her.

The other name is the date rape drug. \n\nBasically it's a strong pill that is crushed up and put into again primarily drinks to make it's victim black out. It essentially makes you black out drunk to where you don't remember anything after that one drink. It's commonly used by predators at bars, clubs even basic restaurants and mostly with alcoholic beverages because it's masked by alcohol so people think they got overly drunk not drugged. \n\nIt can cause extreme memory black outs, and you don't know it happened until it's typically to late unless you got someone watching your back that will not let anyone take you from your spot. They drug your drink and act like a hero when you start stumbling around wasted off your ass because drugged heavily and often it's how people are assaulted without knowing until morning. It'll knock you out for hours in addition to the memory black out.\n\nIt's.....dangerous to say the least. And roofied is the simplistic term for it. But research date rape drug or GHB. You'll find plenty of information on it",

If they do the same thing everytime and/or she was tired and/or she was stressed about something else, then it\u2019s possible she forgot most of it. However, blanking completely is a bit concerning. Like, if you trust her, I\u2019d be more concerned about some underlying health issues than anything else.\n\nAlso, NTA. You bringing it up again does show that you\u2019re not over it completely, but she can\u2019t really blame you, as it\u2019s just a weird thing. Her being sad about it does nothing to ease up your mind. Unconditional trust doesn\u2019t work like that: imagine seeing someone who looks very ill and them being like \u201cI said i\u2019m fine, why are you questioning it\u201d. Cause you dont look well!!\n\nIf it\u2019s only a one time occurrence then yeah, it might be worth getting used to letting things go, not everything is crystal clear in life. You should probably discuss things like these more thoroughly next time they happen, so you don\u2019t keep dwelling on them later like you\u2019re doing now. Good luck!",

When she went back to her home at night, it's a habit that we call and tell each other about our day. So I told her about my day and then I asked about hers. And she just blanked out. I told her to take her time to remember, because she will eventually since it happened a couple hours earlier. She just couldn't. I found it REALLY odd that she couldn't remember what she did a couple hours ago, but I let it go and we moved on.\n\n\nYesterday we were on a phone call and I just said a joke about how she forgets things easily. She laughed but asked why I said that. I referred to the incident that happened 2 months ago. She said that it's true that she really forgot what she did. I said yeah I believe it now, but at the time that made me really suspicious and I thought you just didn't want to tell me where you went for whatever reason. She got really sad because I said I got suspicious of her. She then went silent. After a couple minutes of silence, she said that I didn't trust her. I just re-explained my situation and asked what she'd think if someone just forgot a chunck of their day. I said \"don't you think that forgetting what you did a couple hours ago is a bit weird, and should be at least concerning?\". She said no, and thinks that it's normal. I then said that I didn't think it was normal and sounded a bit off to me, that's why I felt suspicious of her. She said I made her sad.\n\n\nWe usually communicate well in our relationship, so I did apologize to her and made sure she didn't sleep while sad/mad. We're good now. I just wanted an extra set of minds to judge the situation with me and lmk if I was an asshole or not. Thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm medicated, but I have lost memory of entire days, for example, not even knowing if I had showered that same day and having to check the towel to see if it was wet. It can creep on you slowly. So pay attention for further memory deficits.",

I'm pissed off just reading this!\n\nI don't understand why your mother is so invested in Sarah. Why would you want to tell her Sarah cheated on you, after how your sister acted? What a fucking mess!\n\nNot gonna lie, you kicking out the screen and taking off through the window is straight savage. Reflexes up on legendary.\n\nNTA\n\nThank you very much for the awards, kind strangers! My first platinum! And 3 silvers! I'm very grateful! Wow! Thank you!",

And yes she should\u2019ve believed him when he said that he was cheated on. But come on when you reach the point that you have to essentially break out of your moms bathroom to get to your car and drive away to avoid telling someone what happened, you have to take a step back and see how that looks to people. \n\nHaving said that I think op needs a long hard break from just about everybody and needs time to himself.",

In general people will tend to believe whoever talks to them first. And in some case gives them what they need to hear. Sarah did this. By op not telling them immediately what happened, Sarah was able to tell them what \u201chappened\u201d and get them on her side. Remember in the beginning of the post op stated that the family already blamed him for the breakup.",

And mom is clearly already emotionally invested in the young woman she expected to be her daughter in law. That\u2019s common enough - we all hope to be able to love the people our children marry. \n\nBut OP shut down, and wouldn\u2019t talk to his family. He\u2019s not obligated to of course, and owes nobody explanations. But his behavior would lead most people to assume OP did something to cause the breakup. And Sarah wants to get back together, convincing mom that it\u2019s not really over. That\u2019s the only info mom has to go on. \n\nSo mom, believing her errant son is being offered forgiveness but is too much of a butthead to accept it, tries to help bring around the reunion. Badly, as it happens - springing this on her son was an epic wrongheaded move that places mom firmly in the asshole column. You just don\u2019t do that. But then son jumped out the bathroom window, a childish action that confirmed to everyone that he had gone completely off the rails somewhere. \n\nMaybe mom is a manipulative bitch. But it is also plausible that mom was more misguided (ok, an idiot, seriously bad judgement) than manipulative and if son had talked to her even a little she would never have pulled that stunt.",

His ex is okay with him taking her back out of pity, and that shows a lot about her too. OP needs to tell his mom that if she doesn't back off about this situation, than her interactions with him in the future will be very limited if at all. And stick with it.

This story is about her breaking that boundary he already set at the breakup by telling her they were over and telling ex never to contact him again.\n\nThe proper way to deal with cheating stalkers who follow you to your families holiday party *is* to go full no-contact and never talk to them again, like OP is doing.\n\nThe ex even said, if OP would just talk to her just one more time they'd get back together.

As for \u201cmachismo\u201d, well...being cheated on can be embarrassing for either gender, but in somewhat different ways. If a woman stays with a man for emotional and/or financial support while getting her sexual needs met elsewhere, that *is* rather emasculating. (That\u2019s not necessarily exactly what happened in OP\u2019s case but that\u2019s beside the point.) It\u2019s also just generally shitty, but you can\u2019t stop people from having gender-specific experiences and feelings. There are things that women feel and experience that men don\u2019t, or do to a much lesser degree. The same goes for men. Every man can relate to the pain of feeling sexually inadequate, and when that\u2019s combined with betrayal and feeling duped, it\u2019s not hard to see why a man might feel humiliated after finding out he was cheated on. I can\u2019t speak for women, but I imagine that a similar experience would be having people find out that a man she clearly thought was really into her was just using her for sex.",

The post focuses on the cheating and how he doesn't want to talk about it with his family, but it might also just be hard for him to be faced with the girl he thought he was going to marry, in person. Break-ups are tough even when they are amicable and the other person respects your space. Being betrayed by a partner is emotionally crushing and can take a lot of time to get over. And a lot of people go no contact after a break-up because they love their ex and know that they might let themselves be talked into something they'll later regret. The emotional side of this shouldn't be discounted and I would be surprised if avoiding the cheating talk was the only reason he up and left. In his place I'd be straight-up sobbing while stuck in the window.\n\nSympathies, OP.",

My own mother was the one who reached out to my ex girlfriend of her own accord to figure out why we broke up. While obviously not as extreme as ops I do understand what it\u2019s like feeling like your mother also blames you for a breakup. But like I said when it comes to a head that. You need to step away from everybody for a while. Sarah has fed everyone enough lies, that with op staying more or less completely silent that I likely wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she said HE cheated. Or that he just fell out of love with her and dumped her with no warning or talking to her about fixing the relationship. \n\nWhatever she told them though, doesn\u2019t matter as op hopefully packed a bag, booked a flight or planned a drive, took off so dust gathering pto and go doing something he\u2019s been missing the past four years.",

All they should need to know is that OP called it off and is not interested in reconciliation. \n\nIt is none of their business why the couple broke up. For all they know, it could have been sexual incompatibility or anything else that knowing the details of would have embarrassed them to no end. The reasons/details for break ups are and should be private. It was not for anyone else to get involved, no matter _what_ the ex said. \n\nWhen the ex called the mom, the mom\u2019s response should have been, \u201cLook, I care about you like a daughter, but this is not up to me. You and OP need to work this out with each other and I cannot get involved because it\u2019s not my place. If he doesn\u2019t want to talk to you, I\u2019m sure he has his reasons.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the ex called family members to force the issue is reprehensible. And the fact that they were open to discussing it and meddling says that they are TAs big time. It should have been enough for them that OP said that it was over. The only response that needed from family was, \u201cSorry, dude, that sucks. I\u2019m here for you.\u201d",

The longer this had gone on, the more that image of him has had time to take root in their minds and this is the result. Again, without the context you have a person who shows up to their exes house during the holidays trying to save their potential marriage versus another person who decided to jump out the window to avoid someone.  They\u2019re probably assuming he\u2019s just being cold hearted and immature.    \n   \nAnd what\u2019s worse is that the ex is just letting it happen. They\u2019re being an active participant in this lie and letting his family alienate him just so they can reap the benefit. After everyone calms down he needs to sit down with them and have an open  and frank conversation.",

Avoidance, withdrawing and goes as far to kicking out a bathroom window and climbing out. If OP had just told mom, who he also has a relationship with, why he doesnt want to see ex, like an adult, there wouldnt be this mess. He let it build up to this point and should have nipped it when he found out ex was talking to mom. Now they don't believe him because he acted like a lunatic.\n\nOP is running away from his problems. His ego is telling him it'll be humiliating to admit he was cheated on. When HE was the victim. OP, it's not your fault she cheated and it's not emasculating to have your trust betrayed. It's a bad situation you were put in by the actions of your ex.

Since he didn't even tell his family that he broke up because Sarah did something that hurt him a lot, she probably had time to make up some stuff which she then said to the family. In fact she probably wouldn't have needed to, if she went to the mum saying that OP broke up with her for no reason, the mum probably thought he got a bad case cold feet, and his escape from the bathroom would have then made her think he was a coward. \n\nOf course no one owes an explanation to their family why their relationship broke down. But when you introduce your SO to your family and tell them the SO is gonna become part of the family, it's normal for them to get attached. Leaving them in the dark will just cause their imagination to run wild, and weird actions, like jumping out of the bathroom window, will just confirm their craziest theories.",

This is not written down, but is entrenched in the way they treat their women, talk about them, talk to them. It's not exactly in a horrible way either, but just the language used. In these environments, being cheated on is very emasculating, especially if it's not something that's happened before within the family. As an extra but of info, it's not exactly a cultural or religious thing either, although sometimes that can increase the feelings.\n\nAnother perspective comes from the type of person you are. Something like \"the higher you go, the harder you fall\". Men who have a manly, charismatic, domineering identity, the type that you think to yourself \"who would ever cheat on them\", tend to take instances of cheating so much harder than others. It's the shock factor that comes from their mis-specified identity, who are they if not what they and others thought?\n\nI agree with the other comments on \"not being enough\" however that is a two way street",

Not for the way you feel, you can\u2019t help that (although I do agree with people suggesting you see a therapist because of the \u201cemasculating\u201d and \u201chumiliating\u201d - you\u2019re not the one that should be feeling humiliated here but, again, you have a right to feel what you feel). And it was your relationship with Sarah, no question. But your mom (and presumably your sister) also have a relationship with her and, at this point, they have no reason to cut her off. They don\u2019t know she did anything wrong. They only know what they can see (you broke up with Sarah for unexplained reasons) and whatever lies Sarah\u2019s been feeding them.\n\nI would really recommend telling your mom, face to face. Your sister might have already said something to her so if you have any proof, you might want to show it to her. (And you shouldn\u2019t have to do that but Sarah\u2019s been lying to them for weeks already so she\u2019s got the head start.) If they don\u2019t believe you, suggest talking to her, *in person*, and asking her directly about her cheating.\n\nIf this were my situation, I would probably hide out at my mom\u2019s and listen to the conversation and if she started denying it, I\u2019d go in and confront her. But I\u2019m super petty like that and I do not recommend doing it. It would definitely make you TA (but justifiably so in my opinion).\n\nGood luck and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this.",

It's not OP's responsibility to stay with someone, no matter what the final straw is, because his family wants him to marry her.

    "postText": "Throwaway because some of my family uses Reddit.\n\nI (22f) and my mom (47f) haven't always had the best relationship and it only started to get better once I became an adult. She's dead set in her ways and always thinks she's right, no matter the feelings of anyone else. I was always her quote \"worst child\" because I was \"crazy\" (I was the only one in the house with mental illnesses) and both of my sisters could do no wrong in her eyes. We have our days but overall it's a decent relationship.\n\nIn October of last year, I got married to the love of my life (m27). Since before the wedding, my mom asked if I was gonna get my body in shape for the wedding (I'm a plus sized woman) and I told her no. I've always been self conscious about my weight but said that If my husband liked my body the way it is enough to propose to me, he should still love my body the way it is to marry me. I told her this. She let it go. \n\nFast forward to March of this year, I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I started treatment and I have had a noticeable amount of weight loss over the past couple of weeks. I haven't told anyone except for my husband and we agreed that it would be a private matter unless something happened. \n\nMy family came over to visit and have dinner with us for the first time in a while yesterday. As soon as my mom came in she noted my weight loss and asked if I was getting ready for my \"summer body\". I said no and left it at that. My husband quickly changed the subject. At the table midway into dinner, my older sister asked how im doing being a housewife (I quit my job in January) and if I'm bored yet. My mom blurted out \"well with her losing this weight I bet Devin can't keep his hands off her, can't be bored with a husband that keeps you busy, if you know what I mean.\" I was offended, but I said nothing. Devin said \"I don't care what she weighs, she's still as beautiful as ever to me,\" and grabbed my hand. My mom didn't let up, \"well you must want a partner that takes care of themselves, she's on the right track so far\" I'd had enough, I stood up and told everyone to get out. She looked appalled and put up a fight arguing with my husband that I shouldn't be so sensitive and it's not like she's calling me fat. I told her to never come back and that I'm done with her. \n\nMy husband thinks that we should sit down and talk to her about what she said and come to some sort of resolution but I don't want to because I know the conversation isn't gonna go anywhere. I've been getting texts from my family saying \"that's just how she is\" and \"at least talk to her\" and \"you only get one mother\" and ones from my mom saying \"you're being petty\" and \"is not that serious\" but I'm completely over it. I'm the only one she's like that with. I may be being too sensitive over this, but I want to stand up for myself. I shouldn't have to tell her why I'm losing weight in order to justify anything. I don't know what to do.",

I work with children and there have been a few parents over the years who refuse to have their child taken for a necessary neuropsychological evaluation.

Even after you explain to her, you don't need to be close with her.  Let her marinate in how she has treated you.\n\nI hope all goes well in your recovery.",

Even if you were hitting the gym and working on your \u201csummer body\u201d I personally would still find those comments inappropriate. \n\nIt is 100% your choice to tell whomever you choose but keep in mind those who don\u2019t know,  don\u2019t know. \nAlso it may help to tell a few people about your medical situation to get a good support system for you. Even if it\u2019s an online group of strangers going through the same illness. You have a huge situation that you are trying to deal with and any support helps. I was diagnosed with a life long illness a few years ago. It can be debilitating and sometimes so physically painful my doctor sends me to the ER for sedation. But besides that there is a huge mental health toll it takes as well. Huge! I learned a lot about my family and friends during the first few years it took for them to finally diagnose me. Every single one of my relationships changed. Some people bailed, some people made an effort to help and learn, and some people went though it with me. In had strangers become life long friends, family bail, family step up and make sure I was taken care of and fight for me with doctors and nurses. My now best friend Nicole who was a coworker of mine at the time made it her mission to help anyway possible. People can surprise you. \n\nFamily is messy. What it seems to boil down to (and I could be completely wrong) is you just don\u2019t want to deal with her comments anymore. Rightfully so might I add. But do you think she would have said it if she knew your medical situation?\n\nWhat personally think you should do is call, text, message, what ever way you feel comfortable communicating with her at this point and lay it all out on the table. Everything. That way it\u2019s very clear where you stand. Also she\u2019s going to feel like the biggest A ever if she finds out your medical situation. You can set up boundaries and give ultimatums, whatever you see fit. Situations like this I prefer writing something down so I can edit out some of the rage. Lol but I think you owe it to yourself to get it all of your chest. It will give you one less negative thing to think about. \n\nI hope you find some people you can talk to about your situation. It really does help.",

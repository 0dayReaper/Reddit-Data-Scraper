    "postText": "\n\nI (M/37) have a 13 y.o son. I was a widower when I met my now wife. She has a 16 y.o daughter from another relationship. The family is often on pretty good terms. My son is the quiet one in the house, he keeps to himself a lot but not to the point of being concerning. My wife and stepdaughter are the complete opposit. They both encourage him to be outgoing and share activities and join gatherings with extended family. My son complained about having to be forced out of his comfort zone and having his need for space invalidated. I spoke to both my wife and stepdaughter and asked them to give him space and freedom to spend his time however he wanted. they apologized and promised to let him be.\n\nAs mother's day was approaching I wanted to throw my wife a surprise mother's day celebration. It was no longer a surprise because my stepdaughter gave her the heads so she could prepare. Yesterday I got off work earlier than usual to get final arrangements done (we planned to celebrate at the restaurant and invited her family there) I had the key and while I was entering the house through the front door I overheard my wife and stepdaughter talking to my son. My wife was asking my son if he could convince me to let him stay home and not go with them to the restaurant to celebrate. I paused and decided to keep listening. My son said why and she told him that his introverted and socially inept \"attitude\" will make her family uncomfortable and will ruin the mood. He promised her that he'd be well behaved and would try to interact and socialize with everyone but she said that she wasn't buying it. He kept reassuring her but she snapped and told him that technically, she's not his mom so she didn't get why he wanted to celebrate mother's day with her so badly. My stepdaughter threw some (I don't remember) backhanded comment and then both of them were shocked to see me standing there. Both were staring without saying anything. I told my son and his stepsister to go to their rooms then told my wife that the celebration was off, cancelled. she tried to argue asking why repeatedly and I told her why. She tried to explain that she didn't mean it like that and that I only heard part of the conversation but not all of it. I told her I was done arguing and the decision was already made. She yelled asking what she was going to tell her family and said that I was making tremendous mistake towards her.\n\nI ignored her while she kept throwing tantrum after a tantrum. Early this morning she took my stepdaughter and went to stay with her folks. not a single call or text from her so far. Situation is full of tension. I'm upset still but more hurt to be honest. I mean yes I did say I was going to havw this celebration but I thought that what she said to my son was too harsh to ignore.",

She needed to find a way to deflect suspicion away from her erratic behavior and so she made up some BS stories about how she dreamed I was going to kill her, and that was why she had been acting so strangely.\n\nI nearly ended up homeless and had to drop out of college, but the worst part of all was the feeling of complete and utter betrayal when my dad backed her up completely and basically sacrificed me on the alter of saving his marriage.  He and I had had an incredibly close bond prior to that.  Ironically, my nmom ended up leaving him anyway less than a year later.\n\nI\u2019ve been NC with my mom for nearly 25 years and was NC with my dad for over a decade.  But even after I agreed to re-establish communications with my dad, our  relationship has been really fragile and distant.  I lost all trust in him that day and don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to get over it.  I learned then that I was only ever a priority to my dad when it\u2019s convenient for him.",

Nothing is more hurtful, damaging or demeaning than to have extroverts treat you like you are somehow damaged or inadequate for being an introvert.\n\nBeing introverted doesn't mean that someone can't be social. It simply means we \"recharge,\" by needing alone time. The thing is, we don't know this from birth. We learn it with experience. But if we're really unlucky, we get subjected to people like your wife and her daughter, whose influence teaches us that there's something wrong with us and we should be ashamed and try to alter our behaviour.\n\nIts damaging, because if an introvert ends up trying to act like an extrovert in order to fit in, they will emotionally exhaust themselves and this will inevitably lead to future psychological problems.\n\nYour son is still only 13, which means there's still plenty of time to avoid him being damaged in such a way. But it is important to put your foot down over this. They're hurting your kid and you need to put a stop to it. You need to either make them understand this or you need to get your son away from them. Believe me when I tell you, if the damage gets done, then the damage can be permanent. \n\nDon't let it get to that.",

People who are being harassed and (I hate to broach this) abused by people that should be \"family\" don't feel safe whatsoever, even if there is someone they can come to about it. \n\nTalk to him. Tell him that none of this is his fault, and that you are sorry this happened to him. Remind him that he is your first priority, not your wife, and that he can tell you anything. Explain to him that, no matter what he tells you, you are always going to love him and be there for him. \n\nA lot of people are saying divorce is the only option here, and I agree. You can love your wife as much as ever, but when it comes down to it, it's a situation where you have to choose between being married to her, or protecting your son. She does not care for him, not in the way he deserves from a mother figure. He needs you to come through for him here.\n\nEdit: Holy crap y'all, thank you for the awards!

As some others have noted, it is very unlikely this is the first time your wife has done this to your son. As a child who needs his family to survive, it is very likely he won\u2019t feel safe to tell you about it, NO MATTER HOW SUPPORTIVE YOU ARE and how open he is with you about other things.  It\u2019s not rational \u2014 he\u2019s a child \u2014 and may not be fully conscious. \n\nHe knows as much as you love him, you are also allied with your wife. And so telling you puts him at risk of losing you, in his child mind. And a child can\u2019t survive without his parent\u2014we know this instinctually \u2014 and so the child\u2019s mind learns quickly to minimize, avoid, and most importantly blame himself to protect his family. Over time, emotionally abused kids lose their sense of self to survive.  \n\nSo it\u2019s your responsibility as his father to see what you saw with honest eyes and protect him. He can\u2019t protect himself. He likely can\u2019t tell you until you act unambiguously to protect him first, and even that could take years. And if you take his minimizing as permission to not protect him, you will be enabling his abuse and loss of future self.\n\nI wish my dad saved me instead of looking the other way because it was easier for him.",

Being an introvert living in an extrovert's world is hard enough, and having extroverts around who just refuse to understand that not everyone is like them makes you feel horrible and guilty and wrong and ashamed for existing the way you do (at least in my personal experience). Thanks for standing up for him. That probably meant the world to him.\n\nThis seems like a total lack of empathy on the part of your wife and stepdaughter, and it's not okay. Hopefully, one day, your son will realize that he's not wrong for being himself, that it's people who treat him this way that are in the wrong. Getting him out of this situation ASAP will definitely help expedite that realization. You are 100% NTA. A grown woman should know better and should be teaching her daughter better than that.\n\nAlso, when you hopefully do get out of there, please make sure your son knows it was not at all his fault. You left because people who treat others the way they treated him don't deserve a place in either of your lives.",

My oldest is extremely introverted and on the autism spectrum so socializing is very difficult for him sometimes. We always give him the option to come or stay with his grandparents depending on the event and how many people will be there and if he will have space to escape off on his own to take breaks from all the noise and people. About 25% of the time he opts to go with us.  \n\nThe fact that your son WANTED to go and was even willing to step out of his comfort zone and socialize speaks volumes on how much he is trying to make this situation work and he is the child! \n\nI am willing to bet that this is not the first time that she and S.D has done something like this too him and may even be part of the reason for his reclusive behaviour.",

That she even got her own daughter involved makes it even worse. No adult should speak to a child like that, it shows that she has a nasty character. Throwing a tantrum is just the icing on the cake, trying to manipulate you, too. Glad you stood your ground. Personally, I would reconsider if that is a person you want to be with, for your own sake and your son's.\n\n\nAlso, make sure that your son feels okay, and please talk to him about what was said to him. You certainly don't want him to feel insecure about himself because of what your wife said to him. Don't make her words haunt him. Kids are fragile and an event like this can be very damaging.

This would not have been the first time she has done something like this to your son either. I\u2019d say this kind of thing is contributing to him preferring to be alone. It\u2019s absolutely unacceptable. Please look out for your sons well-being and get rid of her. Horrible thing to do to a child when he\u2019s lost his mom then step mom says he should not celebrate with the family. No that\u2019s heartbreaking and abuse,",

Chances are there's a deeper reason he prefers to be by himself, and she likely is a major cause of it. He probably hears how terrible he is from both of them. Being an introvert myself, I often enjoy the quiet solitude. I can tell you, being treated like that for being who I am, would shut me down. No one deserves to be talked to like that, especially an adult and her child to a young adult. You don't treat people like that. What you did was definitely within your right.",

I love him so very very much and think he\u2019s such a handsome kid, even in all of his awkwardness. I hate that your son is growing up without his mother because I know my feelings for my son are what his mother would feel for her little boy if she were here with us. Your wife is totally in the wrong and your son is old enough to hold onto that conversation for the rest of his life and resent her for what she said to him. It blows my mind that she tried to convince him to stay home instead of including him. She married you and was supposed to come into your and your sons life as his protector and surrogate mother. No one can replace his mother, but she can sure as heck act like she cares. It\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t and I\u2019m sorry for you both. I know it hurts right now, but I think you were meant to hear that conversation and step in to protect your son. Hug him a little tighter and make sure he knows you love him.",

We chose 30 minutes because a longer Contest Mode might result in people forgetting about the thread, or worse, not wanting to put in the effort to write quality comments. For example, we tried 6 hours in the past and people didn't like it because the thread just eventually gets irrelevant and no one had the motivation to post quality comments. People don't like their quality comment having the same chance of showing up as a 1 word comment.\n\nBut if it's for only 30 minutes, it allows a much fairer chance for new browsers. No more constant refreshing, everyone can take it easy now. And we're hoping people start writing longer and higher quality comments rather than trying to post quickly to get that karma.",

TheoryOfReddit covers it [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/650fpv/the_mostupvoted_comments_in_reddit_threads_arent/), [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/l8id4/did_digg_make_us_the_dumb_how_have_reddit/), and [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/36wwr6/the_types_of_manipulation_on_votebased_forums/).\n\nIn short, the fluff principle (or conveyer belting) makes it such that more digestible, agreeable comments (i.e. shorter, more circle-jerky comments) rise to the top faster. This is because people use their votes as an expression of agreement/disagreement even though they shouldn't, and it's much easier to agree with a quick \"YTA for cheating, get the pitchforks\" than a longer, more nuanced \"ESH because ...\". This heavily discourages longform, high-effort comments. Another side-effect is that it encourages extremism in comments (no thanks to reddit's echo chambers), though it's less obvious on AITA than on other subs.\n\nThe voting algorithm compounds that problem by making it such that the first 5 upvotes are crucial to a comment's success since reddit is very much a hivemind (e.g. a comment at -1 is much more likely to continue going into the negatives, while a comment at +5 has a much easier time thence of rising to the top of the comment thread), hence older comments have a far better chance to gain that leading edge over newer comments and establish that position at the top of the comment food chain. It's happening in this very thread if you couldn't tell.\n\nGlad to see AITA taking steps against it, I suggested the same thing once over at CMV but the mods rejected it. I'd dig up that specific thread if I could, but it seems to have been deleted.",

Back before I was a mod I was ~~farming those sweet sweet judgement points~~ *participating in the new discussions on the sub* and I found my favorite formula to be pairing my judgement with a one-line pithy sentence and then make a paragraph break where I explained the nuance behind coming to that reasoning and tempering any strong accusations.  Basically I put a (what I thought was) clever tl;dr: at the beginning to capture attention and the fuller description for OP and those that needed it.\n\nBecause the other side not showing your nuance is that when someone comes along and in a single sentence calls out your lack of nuance, reddit absolutely hates when you explain \"well no, I didn't actually explain my entire system of morality in one sentence.  What I described only applies to the details above, and changing those details changes things.\". I can't count the number of times I got downvoted for saying \"well yeah, of course I agree with you, I just didn't feel going off on that tangent that doesn't apply to OP.\"",

I seriously doubt that teenagers/young adults at large think that \u201cmy house, my rules\u201d is something that would fly with other adults, or would use that justification themselves. Especially since a lot of people come out of their adolescence vowing not to be like their parents lol (in the sense of not displaying the same traits in their parents that they personally perceived as negative/unpleasant to deal with)\n\nI generally assume people giving advice along the lines of \u201cyour house, your rules\u201d are parents\u2014which totally makes sense, because parents have to set boundaries for their kids. It just doesn\u2019t fit with a lot of the conflicts involving two adults/adult parties, which is pretty much what this whole thread is about. Sometimes it\u2019s good advice...but sometimes it\u2019s just plain rude! :)",

One or 2 hours will give more time for more critical comments and it'll also give time for others to upvote or downvote the comment and the post\n\nEdit:grammer",

I caught on to this months ago, the only time I've gotten credit for a popular comment was when I sorted by new and got in there early, but tbh it feels slimy to do this as a general rule just to make my verdict carry more weight so I didn't bother to keep sorting by new.  It is also frustrating that you can post a comment with the same verdict as the final ruling, but you don't get credit for it per the flair/titles - how does that even work?  Participation is null and void unless your comment comes in early enough to get enough votes - this discourages people who enter a conversation hours later to even participate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, love this idea it's a great start but it should be the first couple hours, not just 30 mins.",

Before people could pop in, see the answer most agreed with (which generally would be their view as well), and upvote while moving on to another thread.\n\nNow they come in and potentially see something that isnt the common view, they downvote, scroll down, more downvotes, etc.\n\nAlso I don't like that scores are staying hidden in locked or deleted threads. Will they just forever be hidden for some unknown reason or what? We can't even see the scores in our own profiles 15 hours later.",

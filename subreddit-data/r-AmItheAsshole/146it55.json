    "postText": "Both of us are mid 30's and were together for 4.5 years. She owned a house before we got together and I later moved in. During that time we'd done extensive renovations to the place with a new deck, kitchen, living room, stairs, flooring etc. I did most of the work, while she paid for materials and trades where needed. I also told her repeatedly that if things went south between us, that I'd never try to take half her house or whatever I might be entitled to under common-law separation law and I would never do that to her despite it likely being a 6-figure sum.\n\nAt the start of May we split and during the post-split logistics discussion, I asked her to give me some time to find another place ( iwas thinking a month or so). She agreed and it conveniently coincided with a trip she had already booked with a friend of hers that had her away for 11 days. We both agreed that it was an amicable split and that we don't need to end up hating each other.\n\nI've ended up buying a house while she was away on her trip, but of course this isn't a quick process and I take possession at the end of June. In the meantime, she mentioned that a friend of hers has a suite that is free that I could stay in temporarily. I told her that I didn't really want to move only into a temporary place only to have to move again into my new place a couple of weeks later. She literally just said 'OK'. I asked her if she told me about this temporary place because *she* actually wanted me out and her reply was that it's just really stressful. I of course didn't read between the lines at the time that she wanted me to go, and just thought she was putting options on the table incase I wanted to get out of her place.\n\nShe has now told me that she doesn't want me here and that she wants me out (I'd rather not be here either), but I'm 2 weeks away from getting into my place and between now and then, I'll only be around for half that between work and trips out of town. I did get a little defensive with her and told her that she needs to 'suck it up' for a couple of weeks until I can get into my new house. I've since apologized and explained that what I was trying to say was that I know it's really hard at the moment, but I just need her to help me out with letting me stay for a little longer.\n\nThis was my home for a good few years that I'm just walking away from into which I put a lot of blood, sweat and tears. I don't have a problem per se with walking away with nothing to show for it (as I said, I'll stand behind my word that I won't ask her for any cash/equity etc) but I just feel like she's come out with a house worth substantially more than when I moved in, due in significant part to my efforts.\n\nAITA for staying for what will be a total of 7 weeks (5 have already passed) despite her wanting me to go?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It seems to me like a waste of time, resources, and energy to move twice in such a short time and she should understand that. I'm assuming you aren't sharing a room.  (That becomes a whole new situation then). Can you find some sort of arrangement where you two don't see each other much? Maybe even agree to spend some nights at a friend's place or something until you can get into your house.",

But shit, after a break up a month is a bloody long time be living with an ex.\n\nIn reality, you had no idea when you were leaving? I mean you ended up buying a house, but what if got to 2 months, and you hadn't found anything or anywhere to live? How much longer did you expect to stay there? \n\nI feel for both of you, and I suppose you are waving the \"I helped with the renovations and I won't be asking for any money back from that\" in her face a little bit, so she probably sucked it up for the month knowing that you were doing her a favour by not going ahead and lawyering up to try and get half of her house.",

I know it sucks for her, but it is literally 2 weeks. \n\nShe also brought up the point about what was the plan if I didn't find a house. Tbh, I didn't have one. I'd like to think I'd have pulled the pin at the end of May had I not bought something, but it's also easy for me to sit here and say that. In end it worked out and I kinda thought thought she was getting angry at me for a hypothetical outcome. \n\nThanks for the input.",

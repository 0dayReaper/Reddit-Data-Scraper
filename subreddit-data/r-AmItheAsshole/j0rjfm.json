    "postText": "[Original post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/irxyza/aita_for_telling_my_stepdaughter_to_go_ask_her/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nHey guys. It\u2019s been a good 2 weeks since I\u2019ve posted and I figured you guys would like an update. A lot has happened since the last time I posted\n\nSo that night, I did what many of the comments suggested I do, which was to apologize. I told her that I\u2019m sorry that implying that I\u2019m not her real father, but like it or not that I consider her MY daughter. That I loved her and will always be there for her. She started to cry and sob uncontrollably and said \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he [her biological father] love me?\u201d I held her and told her she didn\u2019t need to fight for his approval. I also apologized for looking through her phone; that I\u2019ve come to accept that it\u2019s not an appropriate punishment for a teenage girl, and I was going to find other alternatives. Lastly I brought up therapy and while she was hesitant at first I let her know it was nothing to be ashamed of, that everything she said at therapy would be entirely confidential, and that it could help to have a confidant to help her sort through her feelings. She sat on this for the day, but the next day let me know that she was ready so I set up the soonest appointment (which was last Friday and her second appointment this afternoon)\n\nIt\u2019s only been a week so I don\u2019t want to get too optimistic but honestly I feel like I\u2019m noticing an improvement already. She\u2019s actually been engaging back in small talk when normally she wouldn\u2019t give me the time of day. She\u2019s been following all of the rules, coming home at a reasonable hour, she\u2019s been less withdrawn and more social even to the point where her brother commented on the change today! But the most exciting news of them all is when getting out the car on her way home from therapy, she said and I quote \u201cthanks dad\u201d. She\u2019s never called me dad before so honestly I\u2019ve been riding off that high for the last two hours \n\nI\u2019m not delusional enough to think everything\u2019s peachy but honestly the behavior change in the last week was the most progress we\u2019ve had since, well, ever. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic going forward. \n\nThanks again everyone for your comments, especially the ones who gave me the kick in the ass I needed.",

I personally thought that you were for the most part NTA, but still good on you for taking criticism so well and using that to strengthen your relationship with your daughter. A lot of people in your shoes would not have handled it as well as you did. Hoping life is easier on your going forward, take care dude!",

Just because they are old enough to *know* better than to lash out, doesn't mean they have the emotional maturity to *not* lash out. Unless they have a good model for how to deal appropriately with emotions, its just a matter of time and growing up. And sometimes even when they have models for good emotional intelligence and maturity. \n\nI had a rough time as a teen because I had undiagnosed ADHD and executive dysfunction where I *couldn't* control my emotions once they got to a certain level. Neither of my parents were exceptional models for emotional intelligence like that. Your step-daughter is lucky to have you. Especially because it sounds like her bio dad is a dumpster fire. \n\nThis is going to sound weird as fuck, so bear with me. You might be her \"emotional punching bag\" because she feels *safe* lashing out at you rather than bio dad. It sounds like she's having that realization now. I know a lot of kids with an abusive parent lash out at the *other* parent because they can't safely express emotions to their abuser. Therapy and open communication is going to go a long way here. \n\nTl;dr: You're doing the right thing here.",

He knows our mom will feel guilty about it and he gets the reaction he wants from one parent at least, and he kows that our mother won't abandon him for it, while our dad pretends he doesn't remember ever hitting him so he can't get any resolve there.",

I blame them both, though. It took so long for me to start blaming only them and not myself for what they did, and therapy might be suggested a ton on Reddit, but it really is the answer to so much of what we as humans go through. I'm really happy op got his daughter in for therapy. It's going to help her so much, and hopefully one day therapy won't be treated as such a taboo thing.",

Yeah, we *used* to think like that until science showed that we don't stop developing emotionally until our 20s. I remember in one of my psychopathology classes my professor explained why you can't diagnose teens with personality disorders as, \"because being a teen is basically having a personality disorder.\" She was exaggerating, of course, but it stuck with me and reminds me that teenagers aren't *there* yet emotionally. \n\nWhat's worse is a lot of the teens on here are coming from difficult situations: divorce, abusive families, dead parents, etc. The last thing they need is a dictator in their lives. It's like OPs forget they (the OPs) are adults and the teens aren't. The OPs want to meet in the middle in Pettyville and confirm to the teen that their assessments of the OPs were correct.",

Having been a teenage girl myself I do NOT recommend anything big or face-to-face (when my parents made a big deal out of small stuff I did right it embarrassed me which made me want to do the right stuff less) but sometimes my mom would leave a little note in my room letting me know how happy something I\u2019d been doing lately had made her and how much she loved me, how proud she was of me etc. and that always really impacted me. I feel like if your stepdaughter knew how meaningful it was to you to have those small talk moments and to hear her call you Dad it would start to reinforce the reality that you do really love her and she really does have a dad even if it\u2019s not the one she originally thought. Just food for thought though - you\u2019re clearly already on a great path!",

So many blended families have these issues and struggle to deal with them, we hear people asking for advice every day, that they become part of out subconscious. So when we see these things written in forums such as these, they seem familiar because we have already heard hundreds of similar tales.\n\nEither that or we really are in a Matrix and its repeating the same material over and over again.",

It was more of an introduction to therapy and getting information down. After that it took another 2 before I had my first real appointment. There is no way any improvements could have possibly happened in 14 days.",

Yes, in a lot of places it takes a lot longer to get therapy - but maybe they live somewhere that doesn't have excessively long wait times to get a therapist, or maybe OP just got lucky and found the one therapist that had shorter wait times? Maybe there was a cancellation of someone else's appointment and the office hit them up to see if they wanted the spot on short notice? Maybe covid has affected the number of spots available? Maybe the therapist is new and just setting up a practice, or is some extended family friend and willing to work a little extra to get her in? Maybe they found a therapist that's not with the most common insurance providers? They might even be paying out of pocket to get her therapy sooner rather than later.\n\nThere are a million reasons how they might've been able to get her into therapy on such short notice. And the \"improvements\" are not necessarily even because of the therapist. Sometimes just having the idea in your head that **help is on the way** can be enough to perk you up significantly (I have a personal side story about that at the end).\n\nMaybe this girl is \"improving\" not because the therapy is helping that much just yet, but because for the first time in forever, she feels SEEN and HEARD? Maybe she's improving because she feels loved? Maybe she's improving because a father figure in her life not only told her he loves her, he committed to being her Dad, and that's the ONE THING she's desperately been missing?\n\nOP is not claiming to see magical levels of improvement - just that she's not as angry as she's been, or acting out as much. Just that she's a bit more social. Which to me just sounds like she's... a bit happier. A bit more hopeful. That she feels valued. What's so implausible about that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy personal side story is this: In my early 20s, I started uni, dropped out because of SEVERE depression, and couldn't get out of my room for months (like, literally, for over THREE MONTHS I only left my room for the bathroom and kitchen). Eventually, I made an appointment to get some help, and because I was feeling hopeful that things might maybe get a little better, I apparently presented \"too cheerful\" to be depressed (the things my doctor cited were things like I \"wore clean clothes\" (I lived with Dad and he did the laundry), \"had taken a shower recently\" (because I believed it would be outright rude to go in smelling like I normally did at the time), and because I \"*made small talk\"* and \"*smiled at him\"*.\n\nDon't dismiss this just because the girl is doing a little bit better sooner than seems plausible to you. Hope is really fucking powerful.",

Not great. \n\n\nI went through extremes of rebellious phases, made some really big mistakes, and was a general fuck up. My step parents and parents who took me in when my parents didn't give a damn was the only reason I turned out okay. They got me in to therapy, helped me get medicated when I needed it, and put me on a consistent routine. \n\n\nMy grades improved, and I was doing great, it was the first time in my life that I realized \"I'm not a fuck up. I'm in a fucked up situation.\" From then on, I changed a lot of my life so I can be a person I actually like for once. \n\n\nI grew to trust these fill in parents and respect them. If it had not been for them, I fear the trajectory of what my life would have been. \n\n\nI promise, she doesn't hate you. She hates what you represent, and is angry her biological father can't represent that in her life. A stranger in her life cares more about her than her parent. That's hard to grapple at 16. Therapy is the best thing you can do. \n\n\nI can't promise that misplaced resentment will disappear. I can't promise you she'll ever call you her father, but she will remember the role you played in her life. When she's in her twenties and thirties and unsure where to go, she'll call you and not her father. It's not a competition but a symbol of what you represent. \n\n\nYou did well.\n\nEdit: it's amazing all the typos you spot after you post it.",

I was very happy for her and I loved my step-father. I never wanted to treat him badly because he took care of us. He knew how I felt about him but I never said it out loud. \n\nGood on you for trying to repair this relationship. Step-parent/step-child relationships can be tricky. Your step-daughter sounds very lucky to have you.",

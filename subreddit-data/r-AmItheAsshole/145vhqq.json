It's just me and him at home as our mother recently passed last December, with no other close family nearby to help us.\n\nRecently me and brother fought and my relationship with him has spiraled downhill. It never got this bad before, but I'm at my breaking point and I feel that as if this whole thing was my fault. He has been ignoring me, ever since I kept asking him questions that he deems 'dumb' he gets mad, and I guess the tip of the iceberg was when I asked him to repeat himself because I didn't hear him while I was listening to music. This has gone for a week now, him completely ignoring me and then entering my room to just throw crumpled up paper to 'talk' to me as it contained letters. Which mind you, is quite dumb if you want someone to properly acknowledge you.\n\nNow, I know I shouldn't have done what I did, and that I shouldn't have stooped as low as him, but I had enough and placed on my status \"Stop ignoring me and talk, you're being an ass.\" the last part was unecessary i know, but I had enough and wanted to tell him what he has been doing is petty and quite frankly, immature of him. He's 23 years old for god sake, and im 16, for once he should act his age instead of being so petty to me!\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, he saw it and got mad. Acting as if I have disrespected him so badly that I was gonna ruin his life, I know I shouldn't have done it, and I KNOW I should have been the bigger person, but god I just had it and was at my breaking point, AITA?",

I\u2019m not sure on the current set up, but seems like he might feel like he needs to be an adult and look after you, which at his age isn\u2019t the easiest. I really recommend sitting him down and just having a chat and unpack everything that has happened.",

What it sounds like here are two children navigating stages of grief at various times and expectedly trying unique ways. Even in my 40s, I cannot imagine all the emotions that would come losing my mom as young as you two have. \n\nTry to keep in mind your brother likely feels a lot of extra responsibility to care for you while he is also sad and likely very concerned about what the future holds (as do most young adults in their 20s even under the BEST circumstances). Who/what resources do you have? Possibly a teacher? A pastor?",

    "postText": "My (f22) boyfriend (m24) and I broke up briefly and have recently gotten back together. We lived together but since the breakup and getting back together we decided it\u2019s better for our relationship to not live together. \n\nBecause of this and rent pricing he needed a new housemate. I was more than fine with it and he made sure I was comfortable with it. But because of our breakup and I am very hesitant about getting hurt again. \n\nHis new housemate (f21) moved in and my bf said that we will get along really well and he has reassured me that he has no interest in her and he would never do anything with her. I want to trust him but again I am hesitant. Here\u2019s what makes me uncomfortable, ever since she moved in I have spoken to her twice. I understand that she\u2019s shy but she has had no trouble getting to know my bf and some of his friends but not me which makes me feel like she doesn\u2019t like me. Not to mention that she quite obviously flirts with my bf and his friends make jokes about them hooking up which makes me uncomfortable. I\u2019ve talked to my bf about it and all he says is that she\u2019s shy and doesn\u2019t like leaving the room. I\u2019m here most days and she doesn\u2019t work so she\u2019s always here. \n\nI don\u2019t want to make her feel uncomfortable by forcing a friendship but I find it weird that she seems to want nothing to do with me. When I\u2019m here she will just Snapchat my bf the entire time instead of coming out to talk. So AITA for not liking her? Any advice on what I should do?",

You are/will be the antagonist if you continue/force them to talk and hangout or get to know them after they are clearly showing you they have no interest in any sort of friendship.\n\n\nYou're just some random person that is invading her personal space. She moved into an apartment with someone she gets along with, she did not move in with their gf.\n\nIt's definitely possible that she flirts with your bf and or likes him. \n\nI'd personally say if his friends make jokes about them hooking up in front of you, they probably think it is very unlikely. since if they thought he was cheating or was going to cheat, making you aware of it would be the last thing they would do.\nFor this part it also depends on if she is friends with his friends and you are not, if so they might see her as a better fit for your bf.",

Till then everything was fine we met 2 times and she ony talked to him and ignored me I didn't think anything about it because it was the first time. But then started to ignore me as if I don't exist and only talked to my bf and held his hand while talking after that incident my bf has never talked to her but she always finds way to talk while I'm not near him. Op if your bf can't make you comfortable don't be with him because let me tell you this WILL get worse by time. She'll make you look like the villian so she can impress him,make you feel like an outsider in your own relationship.  Tell your bf if he doesn't do anything about this you aren't interested in staying in a relationship where he can't stop taking to one female you're uncomfortable with",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy (f22) boyfriend (m24) and I broke up briefly and have recently gotten back together. We lived together but since the breakup and getting back together we decided it\u2019s better for our relationship to not live together. \n\nBecause of this and rent pricing he needed a new housemate. I was more than fine with it and he made sure I was comfortable with it. But because of our breakup and I am very hesitant about getting hurt again. \n\nHis new housemate (f21) moved in and my bf said that we will get along really well and he has reassured me that he has no interest in her and he would never do anything with her. I want to trust him but again I am hesitant. Here\u2019s what makes me uncomfortable, ever since she moved in I have spoken to her twice. I understand that she\u2019s shy but she has had no trouble getting to know my bf and some of his friends but not me which makes me feel like she doesn\u2019t like me. Not to mention that she quite obviously flirts with my bf and his friends make jokes about them hooking up which makes me uncomfortable. I\u2019ve talked to my bf about it and all he says is that she\u2019s shy and doesn\u2019t like leaving the room. I\u2019m here most days and she doesn\u2019t work so she\u2019s always here. \n\nI don\u2019t want to make her feel uncomfortable by forcing a friendship but I find it weird that she seems to want nothing to do with me. When I\u2019m here she will just Snapchat my bf the entire time instead of coming out to talk. So AITA for not liking her? Any advice on what I should do?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "comment": "Do you mind sharing why you went on a break and changed living situations in the first place? If it was trust issues to begin with this is absolutely not going to help you rebuild that even if they both have 0 interest and the girl just likes to talk weird. If I were giving a dude a second chance after he broke my trust I probably wouldn\u2019t even tolerate a female roommate situation. Befriending her doesn\u2019t sound like it would change anything either, you might feel more reassured for a time but if your bf enables her behaviour and she wants him she can still just go behind your back. From what I can gather, NTA, talk to your bf with some firm boundaries, explain you don\u2019t like hearing the insentisive jokes from friends and you would like to be a bit more included in their communication, even if you believe him that you just need some extra reassurance for some time, and if nothing changes on his end I\u2019d say end things. If you trust your boyfriend on the other hand then you could let the girl and friends know they make you feel uncomfortable and hope they\u2019re decent humans but that shouldn\u2019t matter than much if there\u2019s enough trust and confidence between you two. If you can\u2019t trust him and he can\u2019t show you he should be trusted to the rational extent, it\u2019s doomed.",

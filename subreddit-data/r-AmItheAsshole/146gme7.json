Many of us are very kind, loving, supportive friends and partners, and it's unbelievably obnoxious (not to mention harmful) to keep perpetuating the idea that if someone is arrogant, dismissive, or otherwise rude AF, that it probably means they're autistic.

But just walking away and leaving her alone like that is rude and a response that lacks empathy. Your friend could also be empathetic and comprehend your response as you tried to help before and she didn't listen.  \n\n\nBy your past and current behavior I understand that you possibly are neurodivergent, you might be more brash, direct, miss some social cues and be unempathetic. This can deter some neurotypical people, but the ones that appreciate you for who you are will understand and stay. One thing that you could do with those of rhetoric questions is to just ignore them unless the other person clarifies that he/she wants an answer to the question. And you could train a bit to read social cues and emotions which is useful if because of work you have to deal with much neurotypical people.",

Answering rhetorical questions may be due to not noticing they were meant to be rhetorical. Though this friend's vent about her phone doesn't sound rhetorical at all. It's not a typical rhetirical question that could be learnt beforehand belonging to the category of questions that do not require an answer. \n\nReading social cues maybe something a person can get better at, but not all. A friend of mine is confused every day about social cues, regardless of trying very hard to understand the mechanism behind them. That asks understanding from others, to be clear and state what is a joke, what is sarcasm, what is a rhetorical question, what is serious. \n\nI would think a person whining to me about their phone would want a solution, and if after given that solution they should clearly tell me they'd like step by step instructions. Reacting like this friend did to OP signals that she did not want to try to solve it. By the sound of it, she wanted the genius bar physically work on her phone for her.\n\nVery tiny bit of YTA for the last part and rubbing salt on her wounds, but I kind of understand how frusting it can be if someone doesn't even try to understand and work for the solution.",

This applies to the initial answers that say you are the AH I'm seeing here.\n\nYou need to find your right balance. All of my relationships are calculated based on the choice between not causing a stir or harming myself by bottling up stuff when I feel the urge to say something. I mean, I won't be friends with people who don't understand me, but you don't always choose family or work colleagues.\n\nIf you are aware of your social limitations and you use it as an excuse to be nasty, then YTA. If you weren't fully aware (which is very common for us), start working on yourself now, it's never too late. Then it's NTA.\n\nAs for your friend, if she knows of your limitation and doesn't make an effort to accomodate you, she's the AH.

But the difficulty gap has widened a lot with the advent of social media and \"corporate personhood\". \n\nThe Ulta wealthy have purposely and systemically atomized society, especially in the US. The purpose of which is to ensure that we don't have community support. If you don't have community support, *and* there is no (meaningful) national safety net, then you are constantly at the mercy of your employer. The more isolated they can make us, the closer to serfs we become.",

Let\u2019s play this out:\n\n- Husband mentions to coworker you\u2019re going on a trip. That would be a normal thing to bring up to a friend at work, nothing to report there if he\u2019s saying they\u2019re friends. \n\n-Coworker goes home and tells his wife that the wife of a coworker is going on a trip. This strikes me as a potentially odd:\n\n- Why would this come up between coworker and his wife at all? Why tell her about a trip that the wife of some guy she\u2019s never met is going on with her best friend? It just seems odd that this would come up in \u201chow was your day honey?\u201d conversation. \n\n- Then we\u2019re expected to believe that CW\u2019s wife comes up with the idea to go with them, having never met them? And thought it to be so incredibly reasonable to ask that she got her hopes up enough to be \u201creally hurt\u201d???? \n\n- So now CW comes to work the next day and tells OP\u2019s husband this GREAT idea HIS WIFE  had to join them. And OP\u2019s husband doesn\u2019t then say \u201coh actually theyre taking the trip just the two of them bc my wife\u2019s childhood best friend is going through a really difficult time\u201d and shut it down immediately?\n\n- Then OP\u2019s husband (knowing VERY WELL that this is about OP and best friend to take time away because of friend\u2019s current/recent divorce) doubles down and calls OP an AH? \n\n- Why have OP\u2019s husband and his coworker NEVER tried to get them all together to meet before this? If this was about not having friends, surely that issue didn\u2019t arise immediately before the trip was being discussed. Why now play that guilt card? Why haven\u2019t the four of them had dinner, or\u2026 idk\u2026 just met each other?\n\nSo many questions.

I\u2019m sorry for your struggle with PPD, for CW\u2019s/wife\u2019s struggles as new parents, and for the position you were unwittingly put in bc your husband implied/suggested that it would be totally fine with you without speaking to you or considering your friend. I\u2019m an introvert myself and would be really uncomfortable with a stranger on a trip with me. It sounds like your clueless husband (as you put it, and I agree) created this mess, and it is his to clean up with them emotionally. Not yours. Easier said than done, but stick to your guns here and know that you are not the unreasonable one in this situation. I think it sucks that your husband didn\u2019t correct himself after you told him you weren\u2019t ok with it, and instead made you feel like shit for saying no - which you shouldn\u2019t. \nPlease don\u2019t even consider having CW\u2019s wife join because of the guilt trip/new info - you are not responsible for their issues, nor do you have any obligation to involve this poor lady because she\u2019s having a rough time (again, you have not even met this woman!!).",

Maybe your husband is a more the merrier type of person. But if his best friend was having a hard time and they planned a trip, would he think that it was totally fine for you to invite some stranger along with them? I highly doubt it. Can you frame the situation in a way that feels more connected to him? \n\nIt's not never, but not this time. The pushing seems weird, but perhaps your husband hasn't communicated (or doesn't understand) the purpose of the trip. \n\nNTA",

And if you did actually call your own wife an AH \u2014 well, that's beyond the pale. That's a really insulting way to refer to someone you presumably care about. You need to apologize to her profusely.\n\nAnd husband, tell your work friend and his wife they have no business being upset. They're  rude to demand the wife be included in a trip with people that don't know. Think how the wife would feel if she went on this trip, found out she didn't get along w/the other two, and then was stuck w/them for the rest of the trip! Let them get together with her another time. Encourage the wife to go out and make her own friends, volunteering is an excellent way.

Is he trying to impress this coworker? Seriously, what the actual fuck was he thinking? How did he jump to so many preposterous conclusions? The entitlement he felt in speaking for 2 grown adult women is truly baffling. You need to rip him a new asshole for the way he tried to push you into his little idea (I'm sure in his mutant head it made sense).",

If the wife wants to make friends, maybe you and your husband could start out by going to dinner or drinks as a double date. Since the guys know each other, it won't be as awkward for you two, and you can see if you hit it off with her. If so, make solo plans with her and eventually introduce her to some of your friends, if you like her.\n\nBut hell NO, this is too weird for words",

The social dynamic may have made perfect sense to your husband and his co-worker, but I am surprised that the wife would have been comfortable with traveling with two perfect strangers who were already friends.  Automatic third wheel.  Either she is desperate for friends, or is being manipulated by said friend.",

I'd be using that time to subtly express how crappy it is that her husband can't step up and help. You shouldn't have to outsource spousal support. NTA.",

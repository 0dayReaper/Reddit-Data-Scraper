    "postText": "\nSo I (22M) have been struggling a lot to manage my time to study, so whenever I had an exam I would stay all night long studying for it. Probably not the best idea, but that's the only way I knew I could pass my exams\n\nI had my last exam today from my engineering degree. When I finished the exam, I planned to get home to rest for a bit since I was exhausted, but another friend of mine (33F) asked if I could stay with her, hang out and talk, since we wouldnt be able to see each other much these holidays. Even though I was very tired, I still accepted.\n\nSo after talking about how the exam went, we went to the library and decided to play some videogames. She then gets a phone call from a friend of hers, so she went out to pick it up while I was guarding her stuff. I waited for her to be done with it, but I started to feel really tired and kinda sick on my stomach so I decided to close my eyes for a bit. I had in mind that she trusted me to keep an eye on her stuff, so I didnt fully sleep, but I still was resting my head on my schoolbag while grabbing hers with my hand\n\nThe thing is, she didnt seem to come back. 45 minutes had passed and she is still out, so I decide to check on her, see if everythings okay. Before leaving the library, I see her talking with a guy from our friend group. I was kinda sad she didnt tell me that she was with our common friend, because she was making me wait when I couldve hung out with both of them too. But I still waited for her to text me or smth, thinking that maybe she met him just then. Also, it wasnt the first time she left me alone for that long while checking on her stuff, but I still wanted to be a good friend. So I wait for another half an hour or so. I check on her again and she's talking to even more people\n\nI got very mad and decided to just go home.  She starts calling me as soon as I leave the library. I hung up everytime. She then textes me, this being our conversation:\n\n\u2022What the hell? You did not just leave like that?\n\n\u2022 Pls not today. Seriously.\n\n\u2022What do you mean not today? I just saw you leave? With all my stuff still in there? Hello? You went too far, dude.\n\n\u2022Go f*ck yourself.\n\nAfter that I blocked her number. A few hours later our friend told me that I did go too far\nbecause her stuff could have been stolen. I was really angry at the time and, to be honest, the library was pretty full of people so someone stealing from her would have been very difficult without anyone noticing. I felt like I was her dog which she tied on a streetlight or something, as if she expected me to just wait patiently till she came back while she was talking to our friend for like 75 minutes\n\nIn my opinion, the least she couldve done is to tell me he was hanging out outside, knowing that I stayed just for her and that I had 0 hours of sleep. Iguess I couldve told her that I was leaving so she could check on her stuff, but I didnt really think about it at the time. AITA?",

Probably not the best idea, but that's the only way I knew I could pass my exams\nI had my last exam today from my engineering degree.

I waited for her to be done with it, but I started to feel really tired and kinda sick on my stomach so I decided to close my eyes for a bit.

Iguess I couldve told her that I was leaving so she could check on her stuff, but I didnt really think about it at the time. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You didn't have to sit there seething for another half hour, which was immature. For all you know she *did* come back while you were sleeping and she didn't want to wake you. You made it a big issue when it didn't have to be one and it wasn't all about this library incident.\n\nOn a totally separate note: Having trouble managing your time, frequently leaving tasks until the last minute, cramming the night before tests, etc., are common behaviors for people with untreated ADHD. Just mentioning that in case it's not something you considered before.",

Maybe she didn't realize how much time had passed? \n\nYou agreed to watch her stuff; if you were annoyed that she didn't come back, *you could have texted or called her and said so.* \n\nIt's not like you had zero ways to reach out to this person. You could have just walked over and gave her back her things and said \"hey, sorry, but I'm bouncing.\" You could have texted \"hey, are you coming back?\"\n\nInstead, you did nothing until you were so mad that you immediately went into explosion mode, told someone that you're supposed to be friends with to fuck themselves and then blocked them.\n\nThat's huge AH vibes and bad friend behavior far beyond proportion to her hanging out outside for too long.",

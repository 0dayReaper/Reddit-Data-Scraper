How can he agree to cut his parent's out of his own wedding? OP basically only bought the house so that his son can comfortably go to college in PA.

He would've never allowed his parents to be cut out of the wedding. Or maybe he thought that if his parent's stuck around PA for too long, he might've gotten exposed for not being the actual landlord. His parent's would certainly introduce themselves and they might talk about owning the house if asked where they would be staying while in PA.\n\nAnyways, if someone has to lie for another to like them, they are just wasting their time. As lies continue to pile on to cover the previous lies, soon they will eventually slip up when they start forgetting the details.",

If my family thought my identity was fake or disgusting or fundamentally morally wrong in some way, (you say evangelical so I'm making some assumptions to service my point) I would have no qualms letting them fund aspects of my life while keeping contact to the absolute minimum. \n\nYou're right that financial independence is needed before dumping your family to their face. 100% it's a necessity and you'd be stupid to dump them before being able to support yourself.\n\nBut you can't say it comes off shitty when their disposition to me was violent first.

Now that dad has pulled the rug out from under him, I highly suspect if OP does update, son no longer has a fiance, blames mom and dad for 'ruining his life' and doesn't realize that fiance and her family are now upset that son doesn't have the money, the parents do, that they already pissed in the cheerio box and can't take it back. Wouldn't be surprised if he also gets calls from the in-laws re-inviting them to the wedding as well.\n\nHonestly u/In-law-issues, NTA. Whatever the case is on your son's side, stay strong. Even though it's brief post, the fact that the in-laws ***moved in already*** gives me strong gold-digger vibes.",

When they realized his \"situation\", I bet they were thrilled, Daughter found a wealthy man! Cause you know that if he's only paying for utilities and food, he's using the rest of his cash to live it up. He probably looked very wealthy indeed.\n\nA more nefarious (less likely) scenario could be that the plan was to encourage the daughter to marry (she could be in on this or not) then move in and make life hell for him/their marriage until they divorce. Then she gets half his stuff and, in their minds, the house. Although even if it was in his name, it was a pre marriage purchase so she'd have no real claim to it. But that's a pretty far fetched scenario, lol. I've been reading too many stories from r/JustNoMIL...\n\nIf I had to guess, the first one seems likely.

There are a lot of other possibilities, but I could tell you some stories about some of the more fringe religious types here. It's a whole complicated history with Pennsylvania being the first of the colonies with full religious freedom and that leading to a several hundred year long history of attracting small religious groups, who are sometimes benign, but not always.

What is son paying for insofar as fiancee, her parents, and wedding are concerned?  \n\nSomething is not right about this situation.

You need to officially evict them and make sure it can not be contested as the in laws are technically squatters due to you not knowing they were moving in and the only agreement you have is with the son. You need to make sure that you're safe to sell the house and evicting them in the right way. Also you need to go over and take pictures and videos so they can't tank the value and are held accountable for any damages, if they're willing to kick you out of the wedding they're probably willing to destroy shit to spite you and you need to protect yourself.",

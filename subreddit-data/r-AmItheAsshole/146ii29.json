    "postText": " \nI've been a recluse since January because of family issues, which I don't like to disclose to friends at times.\nIm friends with 4 girls who are family friends. I met them after a long time in may, and we decided to go out on a Friday night. All throughout the night there is an undercurrent of coldness from 2 (bam and tal) of them which the other 2 (Meh and Jig) are nice and inclusive. Meh says that the group was planning on going on a holiday in july and that \"I'm coming\". Obviously, in that moment, I said, \"How come you're telling me this now? It's already June.\" I then followed up with \"thanks for inviting me, I'll try to see if I can get holidays in such short notice\" as soon I say that the faces of Bam and Tal dropped. They started saying that they had already booked an airbnb for 4 people and that a 5th might not be allowed. I said that it's OK if you can't fit me in, I understand. Then Jig says it's fine, you can sleep on the couch. To which I said that sounds good.On the way home, I talked to Meh about it. Apparently, they were scared of telling me, and she had to be the one to do it because she knows me the most. Their reasoning for not telling me when they were booking everything in the first place was because \"I had disappeared.\" That made me feel so bad because even if I was not messaging them, none of them even thought to ask me if I was OK.  I didn't say anything just said OK.\n\nNext day I talked to dad who said I should go, so I tell them that I'm looking for flights if they could give me details on whether booking would work. They did not provide airbnb details. I then sent a group message just to confirm if everyone was actually OK with me coming. That again brought up reasoning like \"yes we want you to come but booking a new hotel might be hard\". So I said guys, you should've just told me earlier. It was like there was an implosion. Bam and Tal started saying things like we were genuinely asking if you wanted to come, we gave you so many chances to join, and you're here creating drama. Bam said that \"we don't want to give you details because it was a personal trip that we booked,\" and I said, \"That's why I wanted to be sure.\" In the end, Bam and Tal said you're not coming, and I didn't reply.It did feel like all the blame was put on to me. Like they invited me, so they didn't feel guilty but didn't actually think I'd say yes. I have no clue what I have actually don't to them, but Tal has been like this with me for the past 5 years, I would love to cut her off but she is marrying my cousin. Bam is a family friend who was OK but has completely changed since last December. \n \nI feel like they had good intentions because Meh has been keeping touch after the Implosion. \nShould I have just been quiet and not said anything?",

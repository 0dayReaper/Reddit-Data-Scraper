    "postText": "*Throw away*\n\nMy sister (22F) and our family doesn\u2019t have the greatest relationship. She moved out when she was around eighteen and has kept her distance for the most part. She will occasionally reach out on special occasions, but she doesn\u2019t attend any holidays or birthday parties. Our brother (24M) invited our sister to his wedding out of, what I\u2019m guess is curtesy, because they don\u2019t have a close relationship. \n\nMy brother and I (26M) made a bet on whether our sister would come or not. My bet was that she wouldn\u2019t come, and if I was right he would pay me $50. My brother made the bet that my sister would come, so if she showed up I would have to pay him $50. Our other family (My wife, his (now) wife, our parents, and some of our cousins) knew about the bet, and they also made their own predictions. \n\nMy sister ended up showing up to the wedding. At the reception my wife and I approached my sister, and we were catching up since it had been a while since we last spoke. Everything was fine, and we were joking around. One of our cousins joined us, and he pointed out that I now owe my brother $50 because our sister showed up. My sister was confused, so I explained the bet to her. I jokingly said that I\u2019m glad she\u2019s here, but losing $50 sucks. My sister didn\u2019t find this funny, and avoided me the rest of the night. \n\nMy brother was mad at me for telling our sister about the bet, but most people agreed that she was being sensitive to the whole thing. I didn\u2019t mean any harm to my sister, but I can see how she could take it the wrong way. AITA?",

She does seem to reach out and attend special occassions every now and then, so she does make some effort in regards to important things. \n\nNow let's imagine that she *has* justified reasons for limiting her contact. That means every occassion she decides to attend must be really important, because, despite her reservations and second thoughts, she decides to come; only to find out that her family put money on whether or not she would put her (presumably valid!) issues aside and show up. That is humiliating! \n\nAfter discovering something like that, i could definitely see reasons for her distance.",

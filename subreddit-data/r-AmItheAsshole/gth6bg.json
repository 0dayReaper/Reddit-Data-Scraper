The only things that wakes me is my child coming into the bedroom, or my partner gently shaking me. Alarms do nothing, I sleep through them all. I cannot seem to adapt to an alarm.\n\nHOWEVER, I am forever and eternally grateful when my partner does wake me, and often get out of bed and make him a cup of tea in thanks. \n\nSometimes a little help is necessary, as long as you are grateful and appreciative of the help you receive. And THATis the problem. She's not grateful, she's walking all over him and giving nothing in return. NTA OP, this girl is being pampered by you and you have nothing but distain from her to show for it. Get yourself a girl who appreciates and reciprocates in kind.\n\nEdit: Can I also extend my gratitude to the people on here who have suggested a plethora of different alarm clocks for me to try! I'm going to give a vibration alarm and/or an alarm for deaf/hard of hearing a go. I told my partner about this comment and the overwhelming amount of people who wanted to help so he could have a lie in, and whilst he doesn't mind at all waking me up, he is also incredibly grateful for the suggestions - and we had a little giggle at my inability to wake up. He also thinks NTA OP.\n\nEdit: To whomever commented and then immediately deleted that I have my own \"little bitch\" too - nope. I just have a very loving and cooperative relationship in which we both support each other in different ways, with a lovely, understanding and genuinely beautiful (inside and out) man.",

I also have alarms that require me to answer math problems to deactivate.

Even with all of this I still sleep through on a regular basis when my partner is away. I've slept through fire alarms going off in my room. It's not about laziness. I mean, I'm a  lazy person, but that is completely unrelated. The only time in my life this wasn't a problem was when my kid was a baby for some weird (probably biological) reason.",

From the way OP phrased the (hopefully soon-to-be ex-)GF\u2019s response \u201cI\u2019m not done with you yet\u201d, it sounds like she would actually really enjoy it if things escalated :-/ \n\n\n__Hey OP :)__ Loads of people have already voted (NTA btw) and told you about all the red flags, so I won\u2019t waste your time repeating all that - but instead I\u2019ll leave you with some advice for going forward, based on my experience with the long-term relationships I\u2019ve had *(both healthy and toxic ones)*. Since you\u2019ve already gotten loads of replies, there\u2019s probably little chance that you\u2019ll actually read this, but maybe another redditor out there in-/just out of a toxic relationship, could use a little advice and a little boost.\n\n\nThe best \u201crevenge\u201d when dealing with this sort of person would probably be to drop her like a bad habit, and then show her that she has no more power over you, by simply refusing to engage in any additional drama. \n\nAdditionally, you can really only lose by engaging further with her - either she will try to hurt you as much as possible on her way out *(you lose by getting your confidence and self worth damaged)* or she will gaslight you into thinking that you\u2019re too sensitive *(you lose by ending up staying in a toxic relationship)*. \n\n\n__So OP, in case you need to hear this before talking to your GF again:__\n\n-  You tried your best to be a good partner, and it sounds like you really did a good job of it - but some people are never satisfied and will take and take, while claiming that you\u2019re doing a shit job. \n\n-  While being good to a partner is a nice thing, remember that a relationship should be give and take, not give-give and take-take - a good partner will want to give back to you, and definitely not try and manipulate you into thinking that you\u2019re unfair for wanting something basic, like respect.\n\n-  You deserve a partner who values you and builds you up. You have intrinsic value through just being you, and a partner should see that without you having to constantly cater to them. \n\n-  You CAN find someone who treats you better than this *(despite what she\u2019ll probably claim)* - and you deserve someone better! :)\n\nGood luck, OP! *(Btw, I\u2019m sure loads of people in the comments are keeping their fingers crossed for you, so if you feel up to it later on, please throw us an update, so we know you\u2019re ok)*\n\n\n*Edited, because mobile formatting sucks*\n\n*Second edit: I think editing to say thank you for awards is considered bad form for some reason, but please hear me out.*\n*I was like half a day late to the party and clearly wasn\u2019t going to earn a ton of karma from commenting.\nSo I made this post to try and help OP navigate a breakup with a destructive person and maybe build him up a bit, after having been torn down.*\n\n*By giving me those awards, three redditors have made my post more visible, which could cause someone in a toxic relationship to see this comment, who otherwise wouldn\u2019t. So thank you!*\n\n*Additionally, getting my Reddit award cherry popped was a nice surprise, which made me smile during a tough time. So thank you for that too :)*",

I agree with you that she isn't the type of person to apologize sincerely, though.\n\nBut consider that she relies on her BF for more essential responsibilities in her life, and then consider that she currently has no other immediate substitute boyfriends to take over that role. In which case, I think she'd fake some pretty hardcore tears in a flamboyently melodramatic apology. It's actually a common defense mechanisms for narcissists--feign regret once they're caught for their true colors.\n\nIt's up to OP to recognize that if she apologizes then it's bullshit. You can't have that attitude and consequentially find yourself in (genuine) remorse for it. That attitude is entirely mutually exclusive to an apology for such attitude--that's the kind of person she is, and that's the way she feels about OP... *that's* the only thing that's genuine.",

Then of all days he could choose to renege on this commitment, he chooses when she has an exam, which has permanent consequences for her. \n\nIf OP had said the night before \"I won't wake you up anymore\", that would've been fine, but instead he didn't communicate this and he left her relying on him, rather than being able to make other arrangements. \n\nEven if it was an average day and she missed class then whatever but she missed an exam, that can't be fixed or made up. \n\nHe never should've made the commitment but he did, and that means when she relies on him to honour that commitment he is screwing her over.",

For example, let's say you haven't figured out a way to get to work, maybe it's too far to walk and you don't have a bus pass, then rather than leaving you to figure out a solution, (finding a bus route, buying a bike etc...), I start giving you a ride to work every morning. This is a commitment, because I have allowed you to rely on me. Now if I don't want to give you a ride anymore, its perfectly reasonable and okay to tell you I will not be giving you a ride, now you can make other arrangements. However if I just don't show up one morning, this means you don't have the opportunity to make other arrangements, this would be screwing you over. If I had told you before you couldve gotten up earlier for the bus or bought a bike. Even though it was never my responsibility to give you a ride, I made it my responsibility when I had you rely on me.\n\nAlso, being shitty means you aren't honouring your commitment to the relationship, so sure if you want to cheat, break up, whatever commitment to the relationship you want to break, fine. But allowing permanent consequences, outside the relationship to happen isn't cool.\n\nSince we can't reply anymore I'll just edit this comment.\n\n&gt;You example of getting a ride in. If someone was getting a ride in and they talked shit on that other person, it is there fault the ride did not show up. They cannot expect that someone they talked shit about will pick them up. They have to be prepared for one day that ride not showing up.\n\nI'd still stand by the same logic. I mean, if they both got into a fight it's reasonable for the person to expect the carpooling commitment may be off and they should probably make other arrangements. If however, the person over hears them talking behind their back, says nothing, doesn't turn up to give a ride, the person ends up super late to work, then gets fired or some other kind of permanent consequence, they're still screwing the person over and they're still an asshole, even though the shit talker is a bigger asshole.\n\nTldr; commitments don't have to be verbal. Allowing her future to get fucked up for revenge over being a shitty partner isn't cool.",

It's a character type and I don't think it can change. All the nice things you do for them, they see as a 'win' over you which is super fucked up imo.\n\nI had a boss like that. The kinder and more helpful I was, the more she looked down on me, it escalated from casual looking down to actual open disdain. It's probably gonna be similar with your gf if you give it enough time. Right now it's covert disdain. \n\nJust leave. Find someone who is less awful.

    "postText": "He has been seeing this woman for 3 months, and introduced my 2 year old daughter to her behind my back about 1 month in. He only has his daughter not even 2 full days a week. She insists on being at his house when she\u2019s there. I feel like they need quality bonding time with no distractions being that he barely sees her as it is\u2026 She has a son and tells her son to call my daughter his little sister, I feel like she\u2019s trying to use the kids as a way to solidify a spot in his life. Since finding out about her I\u2019ve asked him if he can spend the time that he has with our daughter alone until they have a solid foundation in the relationship. Am I wrong?",

Unfortunately, one of the downfalls of coparenting is when the childish with him, he does what he wants (that's legal) and that includes introducing child to as many people as he wants (again as long as it's a legal setting). You most certainly can ask, can even try taking it to court. But I worked at a court house for 20 years almost... Barely any judge will grant your wish unless as I said he's got issues with chemicals, alcohol, or association of such people.",

You are probably best to ask nicely rather than make demands. You could insist that the child not be left alone with her, as you do not know her, thus cannot trust her.\n\nYou are probably right about this women's motives but until there is something more definitive you should be cautious before going to Defcon 1, otherwise you might come off as the bad guy.",

If you were dating, as the primary custody parent, it might be impossible for you to not introduce your new partner since again you have full custody. So, in the meantime, just be happy that your ex is involved in your daughter's life because plenty of men would've dropped their daughter to the wayside in favor of a new relationship.",

It's understandable given the context of the abrupt introduction that you would feel this way, I would if my child called a stranger dad in front of my face, but this is a conversation you, gf, and your ex need to sit down and have. There needs to be more open dialog, mostly so your daughter doesn't get confused, not on the mom thing, but in the event they break up she shouldn't have to endure the heartbreak of losing a \"parental figure\". Also, maybe an open conversation with your daughter about different family units. This can be a nice tool to keep the reality alive that sometimes families change, sometimes kids have two moms, sometimes one dad, sometimes grandparents raise their kids, but all kinds of families are beautiful, and if she has any questions she can ask you. This one little bit I can not stress enough because that'll be the difference between mom and dad's new gf, if she needs to know something or needs to speak up, she'll know mom will be there to listen. Establishing the connection of \"hey you can come to me for anything,\" especially in this transitional period in her life, will make her feel more secure as a growing young lady.",

You're in that lovely spot where you're an ex and everything you do is seen as out of jealousy, when it's not.  \n\nI know you see what she's doing, but just let it go.  She's not going to take your place.  She's only there 2 days a week.  She doesn't have enough time to really show you up as a mom. \n\nYour daughter will pick up on the tension.  You don't want that, either.  Just try to get along with her for your daughter's sake.  \n\nMy ex's new wife tried that.  Kill her with kindness.  Let her be the bad guy.  Only way to not be a \"jealous controlling ex\" by their standards.  Don't worry, you don't actually have to live up to their standards.\n\nJust sit back and watch her get herself into trouble.  If she's trying to phase you out, keep acting like it didn't get you down.  She wants that reaction so you look bad and she can call you jealous.  Let her make herself look bad and jealous.  \n\nFunny story about my ex and his wife.  They tried to win the kids' favor by going all out on their weekends making it like Disneyland. Carnivals, amusement parks, swimming pools, activities galore, every other weekend jam packed. Of course they preferred going there every other weekend.  That's an impossible standard to uphold when you're broke like they are.  First few months were great, but then they started going out less and less and the kids noticed and got upset about it. It lasted like 3-4 months after they got together.  He had half the proceeds from the sale of our house and blew through it all trying to show me up. He's still dealing with the kids getting upset because they're not going anywhere or doing anything and he can't do anything because he's broke.\n\nI take great satisfaction knowing that his plan backfired.",

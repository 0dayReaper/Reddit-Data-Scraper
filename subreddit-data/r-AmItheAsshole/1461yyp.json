    "postText": "It\u2019s been about a full week since I had seen my gf prior to this incident and she had been begging me to come see her, telling me she misses me and I told her the same. Whenever we see each other we cuddle and give long hugs because since I am working, when I come to her house I will have her come to the parking lot, talk and then hug her hard before I go. \n\nFor reference, she\u2019s 19 and I\u2019m 21. She will be 20 at the end of the year. Yesterday my gf asked if we could hang out, she said she wanted to go to the Mall and wanted me there, however she never mentioned any friends coming along. I get to her house, she gets in and we pull up to the mall and I see a bunch of her friends waiting on her. She explains that we\u2019re all going shopping and I felt like I was third wheeling. I felt really disrespected. \n\nTrying not to ruin her day, I told her to hang out with them and I\u2019d come back when she was ready. I then decided to wait in the parking lot since I had nowhere to go in the area. I asked her not to take longer than 30 mins. 45 mins passes, and hour passes, I called my gf 37 times. No answer so now I\u2019m infuriated. She comes out of the mall, I\u2019m sweating bc it\u2019s 103 degrees and I pulled to the front of the mall, screamed for her to get the f in the car and I flipped off her friends as I sped off. \n\nMy gf won\u2019t respond to any of my texts after I dropped her off at the house, and I feel bad about how I reacted but at the time I was truly angry about the situation.",

Or find something interesting to investigate and keep yourself entertained. Your gf didn't make you stew in a hot parking lot, YOU made that choice.\n\nAlso, it's not on you to tell her how much time she can spend shopping. 30 minutes is hardly enough time to get into a shop, find something, and try it on. You could've said \"be back here in exactly 7 minutes\" and it would've been exactly as reasonable of a request- meaning it isn't at all.\n\nFinally, you called her THIRTY SEVEN TIMES???? Dude that's unhinged behavior all by itself. It's completely unacceptable to constantly spam her like that. I would've dumped you for that alone. But top it off with you SCREAMING and cursing at her and her friends??? Absolutely shameful and mortifying. I'd never be seen with you again.\n\nScreaming at your partner is ABUSIVE behavior. It is NEVER acceptable. You have some big fucking issues you need to sort out, because you are clearly too immature to handle your big feelings. I know toddlers who have a better grasp on their emotions than you do.\n\nEnjoy being single.",

Especially since you're the one who made the bizarre decision to sit outside in your car in 103 heat!! She didn't \"have you\" waiting outside the mall, you CHOSE to wait outside the mall. You could have gone inside to hang out with her or get a soda or even just sit on a bench in the air conditioning. It sounds like you were mad it wasn't just the two of you at the mall and you went out of your own way to make yourself miserable so you could start a fight. YTA.",

            "comment": "YTA My dude, I am going to give you some genuine advice for handling this situation. I am going to explain some things you missed and yes, I\u2019m going to drag you over the coals a little bit, but then I am going to tell you what to do now. \n\nI understand being confused and a little disappointed when you discovered this was going to be a group activity instead of just you and your gf. But feeling disrespected? If your gf wants to hang out with you AND her friends, that means she likes you enough to integrate you into her social circle; have her friends become your friends; maybe even show you off to them a bit! Like. A girl wanting you to join a girls shopping trip is usually a sign that something is going right in the relationship! \n\nBut instead you felt \u201cdisrespected\u201d. And then proceeded to do literally everything wrong. You could have hung out with your gf, gotten to know her friends. You could have found one of those little areas in the mall with the couches for bored husbands and boyfriends to sleep on while their girl shops. There\u2019s air conditioning in the mall.  \n\nYou say you didn\u2019t want to ruin her day, yet you asked her to keep a mall trip under 30 minutes. You don\u2019t say how she replied to that; my guess is she probably said \u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d with laughter bc that\u2019s no time at all. You didn\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m going to be waiting in the abysmal heat so please don\u2019t take long.\u201d If you had I imagine she would have told you they would probably be a while and you should wait in the mall or something. \n\nYou chose to sit in the hot car. And look, it isn\u2019t clear what period of time passed where you were calling her 37 times, but if someone called me 37 times over the course of 24 hours I would be expecting to hear that someone had died. If someone called me 37 times in what, 30 minutes? And given the age you purport to be (which tbh I\u2019m not totally sure I believe that you are only 21. Given that you CALLED 37 times) I doubt you JUST called. How many angry text messages were there? Or what did you say in one text or one voicemail that told her you weren\u2019t calling because of some emergency and she felt justified in ignoring your growing number of calls and seeing them for the red flag they are.\n\nIn all honesty, in a true attempt to help you: please, please seek therapy for your anger management, control issues, and communication issues. None of the behavior you described is remotely healthy. It\u2019s not just your screaming that is the problem. It\u2019s all the behavior and thought patterns that led you to end up alone in the car in 103 degree heat and directing all your anger at your girlfriend even though it was your own choices, not her, that got you into this situation. You don\u2019t see how any of it is your own fault. Her not mentioning her friends did not mean you had to stay in the car. Her taking longer than 30 minutes did not mean you had to stay in the car with no ac. It also did not mean you needed to call her a disturbing number of times. Your anger at her is misplaced. If you don\u2019t want to become the kind of guy who girls tell horror stories to their friends about, then you need to work on yourself. \n\nYou don\u2019t seem to think you are the asshole, which tells me you probably don\u2019t WANT to be an asshole. So be proactive about dealing with your AH tendencies while you still can.\n\nAs for your girlfriend, buddy there is no coming back from this one. Sorry, but you said the quiet part loud in front of all her friends. And really, even if she does somehow consider forgiving you, the best thing you can do is focus on improving yourself instead of dating. \n\nIf she hasn\u2019t blocked your number, send her 1 (one), ONE single message that says something like this: \u201cI am beginning to understand that my behavior today was unacceptable, and if you no longer want to speak to me, I completely understand and respect your decision.  I am going to seek help for my anger management and controlling behavior, because I do not want to be the kind of guy I was today. I am truly sorry for everything that I did, and I realize that I need to do some serious work on myself before I get back into a relationship. Maybe one day when I have grown as a person and no longer have these issues, we could try again. But given what I did I do understand if I have blown my chance with you. I wish you the best.\u201d \n\nAnd then actually follow through. Get help, focus on improving yourself. Regardless of if she receives or responds to your message. You were absolutely TA today. But you don\u2019t have to be in the future.",

    "postText": "I live on a cul de sac with 4 other houses. My immediate neighbor who recently moved in a couple years ago let\u2019s their two dogs run wild, darting in front of cars and charging anyone who walks in the cul de sac if the dogs are freely running around, which happens often. \n\nOne of the dogs jumped on my brand new car to bark and scratched my paint awhile back. \n\nToday I went to get my mail and turned around and was greeted by the two dogs running a foot away from me and barking at me. I feel I shouldn\u2019t have to experience this harassment from his dogs in a shared cul de sac.\n\nThis neighbor is entitled and has had a feud with my dad prior to me moving in and tried to fight my dad while he was drunk and my dad was undergoing chemo. \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my neighbor to get ahold of his fucking dogs that charge and aggressively bark at my feet?",

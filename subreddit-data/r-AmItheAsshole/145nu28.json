    "postText": "I want to preface this by saying, my SO (m29), let's call him Cay, and I (f26) have one 7 mo child together. I have a child from a previous relationship (m6). \nWe have a 2 bedroom apartment and we split the rent. He pays for his car payment, half the phone bill, and groceries. I pay half the phone bill and the electric. I make less than he does and I work less hours bc he is able to sleep longer and work more (which was his request).\n\nHere's where I feel like an asshole:\n\nLately, he's been careless with money. He doesn't budget anymore. He spends a lot on recreational things, games, weed, etc. Before, I didn't care bc we always had rent. With the baby added to the family, we have more expenses. I've been buying the diapers and formula. I don't have the money to cover rent on my own. \nHe doesn't want me to get a second job. He doesn't want me to work longer bc it interferes with his sleep.\nWell today, he wanted to call in. Yesterday, he left early. He wouldn't tell me what was wrong at first. But now he's saying he's been having dreams of his mom dying. \n\nHis mom is not in great health. She has COPD. She still smokes weed and cigarettes. She is still mobile. I talked to her earlier to day, and she seemed fine and in good spirits. \n\nHe was hyperventilating and worrying his mom was going to die. I asked her and she said nothing has gotten any worse and she feels fine. I offered that we all spend the day with her at her home tmw. His response was he just doesn't want to go in. I said I wished I had picked up some extra hours for the week. He got mad and said he'd just go in.\n\nI understand being upset if her health were worsening. Or if she was on her deathbed. He said she hasn't told him she's getting worse. I can't tell if I'm being an insensitive AH or not. I'm so stressed about money and the possibility of ending up homeless with an infant that I cannot think straight.",

Start with regular household expenses, figure out what you need, talk to your SO about what you both want, then look at the money coming in. Then you brainstorm with your SO on how to make everything balance, what can be cut, and how to increase income if needed. Have your own ideas going on, but try to make this a collaborative thing.\n\nAs for you... Get out of the house. Go sit in a park or on a beach with a notepad and jot down your thoughts and ideas. That might help you take control of this mental and emotional spiral.",

That\u2019s it. Let him take his mental health day if he agrees to take whatever he would make in a day out of his spending money and put it into the bills account. Then ask him whether he would rather cut his unnecessary expenses, or have his sleep disrupted while still cutting his unnecessary expenses a little bit but not as much. If neither of those work for him THEN he\u2019s verging into deadbeat territory but at this point based on what you\u2019ve said it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019ve had a conversation about how finance distribution would have to change with the baby, you\u2019ve just shouldered the burden without talking about it. If you want to kick him to the curb because he didn\u2019t automatically make the same decisions as you like people are saying fair enough but then you\u2019ll be a single parent without having tried to work something out with the person you otherwise care about. Who doesn\u2019t want you to take a second job. For selfish reasons but still, you don\u2019t want to take a second job if you don\u2019t have to and he\u2019s willing to work more to have it the way he wants.",

He sounds like a child but is 29??? YO. NO. Let me guess you do all the baby work and cleaning? And now no money? Why did you have a child with man?? Sit him down. That baby is his RESPONSIBILITY. A NEAR 30 YEAR OLD CAN GO TO WORK CAN VISIT HIS MOM AND HELP YOU WITH THE BABY. WTF is up with you? RENT AND BABY FOOD AND HUMAN FOOD IS A REQUIREMENT. You have bad taste in men. He is not mature and you made a baby with him? You're gona starve because he buys weed and eats the little you do have when he has the munchies. WTF. What happens if you guys can't pay the rent...are you gona let him just smoke weed while you and your baby are homeless? And smoking with COPD is really reckless..she doesn't care about her own health...so why should you??? Wake up. I bet you he plans on how he will buy weed and food for the munchies but that's it. He wasn't hyperventilating you fool he was high and emotional about his mom who obviously doesn't care she's sick. Grow up both of you before something happens to your baby because there's no food.

I know it sucks but people never show their true colors until they think they've got you 100% and you'll never leave. That's what having a baby means to some men. \"You're mine now and you'll take my crap\". It's not okay to leave your baby hungry or homeless. It's not his mental health. Prioritize your child. You're not his mom...you're your baby's mom. HE IS 29. Don't fall for this at all. You can def find your own place and even get a normal paying job. I think you're pretty amazing for already doing it on your own. He won't change....He can't be relied on..what happens during the next stressful event? It is not fair you have to take care of the financials for the baby, rent, and supplies and care for an infant, while he does nothing but spend money on smoking and videogames. That is not normal. You are already doing it alone and taking care of his bills as well..... You can def find a smaller apartment for you and the baby and save up for future expenses for the baby. Working 2 low paying jobs isn't worth exhausting you. Find a full time one and get out. I'd rather you know now than ruin your whole life. He also can't dictate what you should do (no one cares about you and your sleep but you should care about his??!!) . It's crazy that going homeless because of his behavior is something that instantly woke him up. The weed is very strong....that's where the money is. How are you working, taking care of an infant, and sleeping???? You'll exhaust yourself and then the baby won't have anyone. 1 steady and secure parent is better than having no parents. Him having the baby from 830-2pm isn't anything at all btw (6 hours a day is not daddy material... it's also not spending all the money on weed...is he high and/or playing video games around the baby...while you go work for the rent? )",

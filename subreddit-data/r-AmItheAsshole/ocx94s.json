He was bringing a girl over that night, so I took a pair of his boxer briefs out of his dresser, and smeared a healthy amount of that natural peanut butter (with the oil and nut chunks) on the ass part, and left it visible on his bedroom floor. \n\nThey went into his room and a few seconds later the girl walked out quickly. Turns out they walked in on our cat licking the peanut butter out of it and it totally grossed both of them out. I did not expect this but it made it more hilarious, looking back.\n\nMy roommate was pretty upset. For him to believe it was peanut butter, I had to willingly take a whiff out of the \u201cstain\u201d with no disgust on my face, then he hesitantly tested it out. We agreed no more pranks after that, apparently he really liked that girl.",

This is some relationship ruining shit because teenagers need privacy and want to know they are safe in their own home. \n\nAnd OP is being generous if they are taking stuff and not giving it back because he could have easily of called the cops on the *adult* twins and say they were stealing from his *minor* daughter. Not to mention your wife backing up her brother after the hurtful comments. \n\nOP you need to talk to your daughter and alsolet her know if her mother says anything that makes her upset she can come to you and trust you.

I think it's telling that two 18 year olds moved with their dad instead of staying with mom where they grew up. \n\nDo the 3 of them have jobs? Do they have a timeline of when to be out by? To save money? Are the twins going to college in the fall? \n\nI hate to say it but if I were in your shoes I'd be worried that they have now moved in for a good, long time unless you become a firm boundary, line in the sand person. Like saying \"this needs to be dealt with\", and demand your wife go to couples therapy - with only you, or family therapy with only you and your daughter. No extended family, so that you can work through immediate family issues, like why your wife suddenly went from valuing privacy to thinking your daughter doesn\u2019t deserve boundaries and it's ok to make your daughter feel like she doesn't matter. \n\nThe biggest issue is following through on whatever consequence you place out if your wife isn't willing to change, if it's that you and your daughter get an apartment, or that you kick out the in law's, or that you threaten divorce. Don't say a consequence that you won't follow through on, or they'll just get 1000 times worse bc they know you won't act on your threat/ you're bluffing. \n\nAnd silent treatment is a go to of an abusive relationship, Zoey feeling guilty to apologize for something that a. *Isn't wrong* and b. *Is protecting herself* is *exactly* what they want. They want an apology for your daughter valuing herself. Please don't let her. This is early conditioning of manipulation which easily leads her to become an easier target for toxic and/or abusive relationships.",

And to be clear, the conflict *needs* to be inflamed, because BIL sounds like a real psycho and his poor kids are gonna be the same if no one in their environment makes it clear that this behavior isn't normal or tolerable. But maybe that should take the form of OP setting a very clear ultimatum re what treatment of his daughter he will and will not tolerate, and what he's prepared to do to ensure her dignity, rather than anything that might get his wife and BIL bogged down in fighting for the moral high ground.",

Sammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said \"my daughters aren't thieves!!!\n\nThey seem to be under the wrongful impression that to be a thief you *have to* wear a mask and carry a crowbar. But theft is:\n\n**Theft** is the taking of another person's property or services without that person's permission or consent with the intent to deprive the rightful owner of it. -- [Theft - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft)\n\nThis is literally what they have been doing. Taking stuff that wasn't theirs. And the rightful owner incurred a loss.\n\nSammy, who is your *guest*, sounds like an AH:\n\n&gt; he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart \n\nWhile this is probably true, it is none of his business. And doesn't change a thing. If you steal from a store then the store owner could just get more stuff, but nobody (should) considers that to be an excuse.\n\n&gt; [he said Zoey] shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this \"defect\" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is. \n\nInstead of talking to his kids, he *blames the victim*. \"We took her stuff, because *she* shouldn't have said stuff. It would be better *my kids* had *her* stuff! Ugh!\n\n&gt; He accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement. \n\nNot only does Sammy refuse to teach *his* kids not to take other people's things, he also considers *you* to be a bad parent. Even *if* you were incorrect in how you raise your kid, even *if* it would be better if your daughter shared her make-up, he is in *no position* to demand it, and his daughters, who are *guests in your house*, should follow reasonable \"house rules\".\n\nYour wife is choosing her brother over her daughter (and you), and hasn't thought things through. What if they next go through *her* things? What if Sammy next goes through her underwear?!? Where does it end? Expecting people not to go through other people's stuff in perfectly reasonable. Sammy is an entitled ass.",

You are your daughter are already uncomfortable in your own home. Your wife is upset. You need to do what is right for your immediate family before it puts even more strain on your relationship.\n\nI think you need to get them to leave before it gets worse. It doesnt take much imagination to see how it could.\n\nHow uncomfortable do you have to be in your own home before something snaps? This is not a tenable situation.

You have allowed her to enforce these boundaries in the only way that seems to work with them.\n\nAs a female myself I know that the make up I use is some of the most expensive due to serious skin issues (allergies and dermatitis) so I don't share and have never shared my make up one of the quickest ways to get an infection is using someone else's eye make up or mascara. Thank you for having your daughter's back and showing her that no she is not being a bad person by asking for and enforcing boundaries",

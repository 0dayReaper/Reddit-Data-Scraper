    "postText": "   I (20) live with my partner( 20) and our roommate(35), along with her 4 children, ranging from 14 to 3. We all have jobs. Mine is part-time, so I have 3 days off instead of two. My partner and I usually stay in our room, and when we aren't, it's either to let the dogs out, to go eat or go to work, with the exception of an outing once or twice a week.\n   My roommates kids destroy the house when they are home. And when I say destroy, I mean toys all over, books and pull-ups all over, dishes stacked high, trash filled to the brim etc. My dogs help create the mess a little bit, as do hers. \n    She posted online that she doesn't think it's fair for the kids to be  cleaning up messes that the dogs made, and claims that we never clean anything.\n    She complained about how we never do any household chores or help clean up after the kids.  My partner and i have cleaned her dogs nasty kennel, we were picking up her kids full pull-ups, we have loaded the dishwasher multiple times, even though we only use a plate or two. She never talked to us about this either. We stopped, since we didn't feel like that should be our responsibility. We've been only cleaning our stuff. \n Not our kids, not our mess.\n\nEdit: We stopped cleaning up after them before she posted this online. We've tried having a conversation with her, and we're going to try once more. We are currently looking for a place, and will be telling her then.",

It should be your/BF responsibility as well as roommates, to contribute to general upkeep cleaning such as mopping, vacuuming, bathrooms, kitchen, dusting, etc. But most definitely not when all the children's stuff is spread about cluttering those areas. If you were to live without the children those are normal duties required to maintain a reasonable living condition and should not be ignored but split with reasonable accommodations. Dogs do dirty floors, walls, furniture, contribute to dust, dirt on lower kitchen cabinets/doors, etc. As for dishes, granted you two don't participate in meals cooked by the family then I see no reason to contribute beyond washing what you use. Hopefully you don't just add to the pile. I would personally just address roommate's post, telling her you have seen it and think a fair compromise would be to make an agreement for the cleaning duties of the home.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\n   I (20) live with my partner( 20) and our roommate(35), along with her 4 children, ranging from 14 to 3. We all have jobs. Mine is part-time, so I have 3 days off instead of two. My partner and I usually stay in our room, and when we aren't, it's either to let the dogs out, to go eat or go to work, with the exception of an outing once or twice a week.\n   My roommates kids destroy the house when they are home. And when I say destroy, I mean toys all over, books and pull-ups all over, dishes stacked high, trash filled to the brim etc. My dogs help create the mess a little bit, as do hers. \n    She posted online that she doesn't think it's fair for the kids to be  cleaning up messes that the dogs made, and claims that we never clean anything.\n    She complained about how we never do any household chores or help clean up after the kids.  My partner and i have cleaned her dogs nasty kennel, we were picking up her kids full pull-ups, we have loaded the dishwasher multiple times, even though we only use a plate or two. She never talked to us about this either. We stopped, since we didn't feel like that should be our responsibility. We've been only cleaning our stuff. \n Not our kids, not our mess.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

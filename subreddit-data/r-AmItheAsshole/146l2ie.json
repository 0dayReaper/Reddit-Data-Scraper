I'm also not usually a fan of the gendered insults like this but she's the one who decided to pull you aside at the party and start this whole thing, including trying to tell you that you've somehow had an easier life despite the fact that you lost your mother at a young age and have had to deal with your own father consistently putting you on the back burner for his new family.

So seriously this wasn't even meant for OP to begin with. I think they honestly invited her to belittle her. I could be wrong but I'd feel slighted if I were OP and I'd want nothing more to do with them if they were going to continue to treat me that way. \n\nI'm sorry you're going through this, OP. Just know that your aunts see you for you. That's why they're supporting you. They see that you're an amazing and hard working individual, and they're lifting you up because of it. They want you to thrive and they saw that you were having a hard time living with your dad, step mom and siblings. You have a place with them, and they'll always support you the way you deserve to be supported.",

My mother is literally dead and my father loves her more than me while she has three loving parents.\n\nWe fail to recognize that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. And teenagers are not known for well reasoned arguments. So while the step sister's concerns are petty and materialistic, they are real concerns. Obviously talking about what's \"fair\" is childish, but the step sister is seeing OP have a better life *now*. The step sister has not - and probably cannot - fathom what it's like to have grown up without a parent and without her father's (or step father's) attention and is not operating from a place of empathy. But that's teenagers.\n\nSo OP is 100% NTA, but it's a little over the top to blame the step sister for anything in this case. We're castigating her for not having empathy for the OP's situation, but empathy goes both ways. I won't make the argument that the step sister's \"grievances\" are equal to OP's, but we have to remember this is a *teenager*. She deserves some accommodation as well.",

It isn't always dependant on beating out everyone else for grades, some schools have a committee that nominates valedictorians based on certain criteria, which include being among the top of the class, but also what else they've done with the school, then students vote on it to select one.  In other schools, the valedictorian is based solely on grades. But for the most part, unless there's a tie-score in whatever evaluation is used, there is usually only one valedictorian per class, it's not a group designation like summa cum laude.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit to add, I'm not at all trying to imply that you're lying, just that your school's definitions were odd, so caused me confusion.",

You want your dad's love and attention and she wants the nicer things in life that you are getting now.\n\nShe says you have it easier even though you lost your mom... low blow.  I am sorry but she deserved to be called something much worse.  I get it, she is mad and jealous and wants to make you feel bad. You are angry and have enough and stooped to her level. \n\nWhen people push people into a corner and just expect them to take it and are surprised when they come out punching? Really?\n\nAll things considered here... You are a teenager and said something in anger when provoked.  In my book that makes you NTA. \n\nYou might want to fill your aunts in about what happened and let them deal with your dad and stepmom, if you do not want to deal with them.",

Parents should understand this and stay out of it, I am pretty sure you both will patch it up as life goes on, from your words I can say you both are pretty civil around each other and respect each other.\n\nShe has to learn not to compare herself against you and keep poking it around you, especially when she is a constant reminder how your own father loves her more. Anyway continue on with your life, no need to feel sad about this incident. \n\nI had 2 cousins same age as me, we had a raging cold war among us, its still going on tbh, we had often said mean things to each other when we were teens and it never ends so learn to live with it.",

Sorry, but it has. You have access to the kinds of opportunities (and luxuries!) that she could never dream of. When you leave college, you will have no debt. That\u2019s a pretty exceptional thing, especially in the US. I grew up a lot like you, and it\u2019s only after I went away to school that I really understood all of the stuff that I had been sheltered from. So I\u2019m sympathetic to your stepsister\u2019s position, and based on some of her complaints I\u2019m inclined to think that you do flaunt it, a little bit (the Europe trip being one example, the whole thing feels kind of exclusionary.) Calling her a bitch was out of line, and feels disproportionate to the situation. \n\nThat said, it sounds like your stepsister is aware of your bad family dynamic and manipulates it for her own gain. You guys are in a competition, and that\u2019s her weapon of choice. She monopolizes your father\u2019s attention because she feels like it\u2019s the one thing she can actually have that you don\u2019t. \n\nBut the biggest assholes by far are your father and stepmother, who are ineffective and cowardly parents. They\u2019re at the heart of all of this shit, and they\u2019ve managed to turn two girls who should theoretically have everything in common against one another. That\u2019s a real shame.",

Turned out sister was told that parents were allowing the \"washed up\" OP to live there out off the kindness of their hearts. And that \"golden child\" sister, about whom OP was told among other things that her hobbies were far more important than OP's medical problems, was fed the same things all the time, but this time about OP. So no scape goat/ golden child scenario, but f*ed up'd parents pitting their kids against each other, ruining their relationship in the proces.\n\nMaybe something similar is happening here as well.

And what I\u2019ve come to realize as an adult is that that financial privilege made a *huge* difference in my life. It\u2019s what allowed me to grow up in a nice house in a top school district, to promptly see a psychiatrist when I was depressed, to access the best therapies for my CP, and to go to college debt-free. When you have money, a lot of the barriers inherent to existence just aren\u2019t there. You can access your full potential because you have the time and mental energy to do so. I mean, I was a smart kid, and I worked hard, but there were probably a lot of kids who were smarter and more hard-working than me who ended up in a worse position just by virtue of the fact that they didn\u2019t have access to the stuff that I did. And that is privilege. It's an incredible privilege to be able to do what you want, to go where you want,  without having to worry about how you're going to afford it. People (particularly rich people) get really defensive when you point this out, but it's true. Class privilege, much like white privilege, is a thing that exists regardless of the personal challenges that you face. \n\nI say this because I\u2019m not sure that OP fully understands (just like I didn\u2019t understand at one point) just how much of an outlier she is. Most people don\u2019t live the way that she does, and if she goes around telling them that they should \u201cappreciate what they have\u201d when they point that out, she\u2019s gonna look super tone-deaf and out-of-touch. I don\u2019t think that stepsister handled this well at all, but she\u2019s not necessarily wrong about the money stuff. The Europe trip is a perfect example--OP and her friends know that stepsister struggles with money, but they're still planning a huge 'friend getaway' to Europe right in front of her. That's gotta hurt.",

They'd have to do it part time just so they could work and afford rent whereas I was able to stay at home. Made a huge difference. Have mates that've got it far easier too. All of them have the same thing in common, they understand the benefits they have and aren't dismissive of each other's problems which is why we all get along. \n\n\nYou've hit the nail on the head entirely here. OP has had a huge loss that can never be made up, but that doesn't mean they're entitled to dismiss others. It totally sucks, the situation and like you said it's turning two people who really should be able to get along, against each other. \n\nI almost wonder whether there's more to the story regarding the dad and the party and maybe trying to make up for a bit of jealousy that was there that may've been discussed prior or something. Regardless still doesn't excuse his actions. Definitely sounds like there isn't heaps of communication with OP and dad.

Either way he may not read it but you wouldn\u2019t have to deal with him putting you off, and I would add that you\u2019ve attempted to talk to him about this.  Let him know that if he wants to have any relationship with you in the future that he will need to reach out and if he wants to meet and discuss things you would be happy to do that but he would need to meet you at a neutral place, not at him home.  Let him know that it would be just the two of you and that if he comes with anyone you will leave as it\u2019s just between the two of you.  Going forward you will no longer make any attempt to be part of his family.       I\u2019m not telling you to add this but in my catty part of my brain I\u2019d want to add: you didn\u2019t want me during the first three years of my life, barely put any effort in being part of my life while I lived with you as stepsister was more important to you, and based on his past actions you are under the impression that he will not want to be in you life going forward and without him making that effort you\u2019re moving on with your life.\n\nIt\u2019s important that the two of you do things with just the two of you in order to to form any type of bond and without that you\u2019ll just be in the same spot.

I do think it\u2019s time for you to have a serious talk with your dad about his treatment of you. Based on how he responds to your feelings you should think about going NC with them.",

Your stepsister had the unfortunate luck of ending up in your dad and stepmom's care. Your sis has grown up thinking she's better than you, but also poorer than you, because they've taught her that. In a way, you serve as a perfect tool for your dad and SM to control the narrative as to why they're such shit providers--'OP only loves her rich family and she thinks she's better than SS.\" When in reality, it was the two of them that worked to foist you off on others so they could have their own family. \n\nYour SS isn't perfect, but you're both kids that have been manipulated by evil parents. It's my sincere hope that in a few years from now when she's no longer dependent on those people to shelter her, you two will team up to expose your parents for the manipulative assholes they are. Get mad at the right people.",

She needs to learn not to whine and try to push people aside when she wants something that's not hers. She sounds like a cranky toddler fighting over a toy.\nShe also hasn't left you with much you can do to restore good relations because she's more focused on kpop than friendship. It's too bad.\nGood luck!",

Because of this, I was able to take another friend, Lindy. Lindy and I have known each-other since middle school and my kpop obsessed friend, Natalie, since the start of sophomore year. Natalie and I aren't really close but lindy and I are bestfriends so naturally I decided to take her. But ever since Natalie found out I was taking her, she began to get mad at the fact I was taking Lindy and not her. She has been repeatedly telling me how much she likes the kpop group and how much she wants to see them in person ever since finding this out, I'm not sure if it's in hopes I'll abandon Lindy and take her instead but it makes me uncomfortable. She has also told me that Lindy doesn't know the group member names so I shouldn't even take her in the first place. This is making me uncomfortable and I can't help but think AITA for not taking Natalie even though I'm not comfortable enough to take her to the concert?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

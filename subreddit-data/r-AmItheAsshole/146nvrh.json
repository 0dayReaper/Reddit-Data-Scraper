And yes I went though my selfish teenage phase around 13-15, but now I am trying to be more mature and not selfish. When I turned 14 I started changing my style from clean vans to more of a biker look, let\u2019s just say my mother hated my style and was very honest and open about it. My mother said very hurtful things which I felt a loving mother would never say to her child, I did grow up LDS and I am still active but my older sister(21 now) left the church. But I am not judging her as I believe that it\u2019s not my life and it doesn\u2019t effect me. My mother favored her when I was 14 and still does when my style was changing she would bash on me but not my sister who was not active, again not judging but I wondered if I am still going to church and my mom is super religious can she at least not show favoritism? Once I turned 15 my mother still called me names when we fought and though I admit I was wrong too I never said the painful things she told me, she gave me the cold shoulder and denied me as her son. When I turned 16 I got sick of her bashing on me and said that if she didn\u2019t change her ways I would not take care of her or help her out and that she could be taken care of by the child she actually wanted.",

I know that can be hard to hear, but swearing at you and disowning you are not okay behaviors. Beyond being abusive, she's pushing you further away. Eventually you'll get older and meet people and form the family you choose, not the one to which you were born. Your choosen family should be supportive and kind, but call you out on your bs, too! \n\nEdit because I posted too soon!",

Whether you or your siblings have the same religious views and practices (including no religious views or practices) should have no bearing on how you are treated by anyone especially your parents. Your mother calling you names and treating you poorly for how you dress makes her an AH. To be clear telling her you wouldn't take care of her because of her behavior is a very good thing to do because it sets a boundary and removes the possibility of them honestly saying something like \"I didn't know (it bothered you or I was doing it or blah blah blah).",

I should rephrase YTA for even bringing it up, if you didn't expect her to be treated worse for leaving your parent's religion while you stayed then you wouldn't have brought it up in a post about how your mom treats YOU and what YOU said to YOUR mom about it. Your sister and her religious decisions are irrelevant to the question at hand, at least they should me. You bringing it up makes it seam like subconsciously you resent both your mom and your sister because you don't think your sister has been treated badly enough when you compare it to how you feel you've been treated for changing the style you choose to dress in.\nEDIT to add:\nI'd bet everything that at some point you thought something along the lines of, \"Why are they treating me like this when all I'm doing is dressing different when (sister) has actually left the church\"",

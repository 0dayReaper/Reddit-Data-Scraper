I saw that the aisle next to me was almost empty except for the one person the cashier was checking out. She was holding a closed sign, but I wasn\u2019t sure if she was removing the closed sign or about to put in on, so I leaned over and stepped literally one step out of the line. She gestured that it was closed so I stepped back. In the whopping 2 seconds that that took, another woman stepped next to me and started pushing forward in front of me. Her friend who had gotten in line behind us told me that I needed to get in line and wait my turn. I said I am in line, and she insisted that I wasn\u2019t because I stepped out. I was annoyed but I didn\u2019t want to argue so I just irritatedly said ok and stepped behind her. After I already agreed to let her go first, she was like, \u201cyou stepped out of line\u201d. I responded \u201cit was literally 2 seconds, it was obvious I was just checking if the other lane was open\u201d. And she was like \u201cit\u2019s the principle of it, remember that for next time young lady\u201d. That pissed me off so I muttered under my breath \u201cyeah you sound delightful\u201d. She heard and gave me a dirty look and we both started muttering things about each other under our breaths. Am I in the wrong?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

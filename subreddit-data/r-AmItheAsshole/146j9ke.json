It doesn\u2019t have to be intense or long, just \u201chey, I realize I overreacted last night and put a damper on our dinner. I\u2019m really sorry about that.\u201d  Wouldn\u2019t be the worst idea to call the restaurant and apologize either - if nothing else, you get the peace of mind of knowing you owned up to your behavior.  \n\nBut for long term? I think you need to spend some time thinking about why your instinctive reaction was to yell, make a scene and demand compensation. Do you see servers as less than you and you got pissed that a peon dared to inconvenience you? Are you generally quick to fly into a rage and need better coping techniques for anger? Have you been under stress that you haven\u2019t addressed directly and it\u2019s bubbling over? Generally, the acceptable way to react is to be disappointed, maybe exclaim from the surprise of the incident, then accept the server\u2019s apology and move on. Sucks, but it happens. That you jump to confrontation instead is not good.",

    "postText": "Edit to save people from panic attacks: Father day in Belgium is on a different date than in many other countries.\r\n\r\nMy wife (34F) and I (36M) have a great relationship and have been married for 10 years. We have two kids (6M and 8M). \r\n\r\nWe don't make a huge deal of special occasions like mother day, valentine, father day. But on such occasions we will take care of nice breakfast and have a small present or something like that. Since the kids now also make their own gifts at school and recite a poem it's really fun. \r\n\r\nI easily remember dates like that but my wife, who has the best intentions, forgets them quite easily. Birthdays, anniversaries, I try to remind her now and then but it's hit or miss. I've learned not to make a big deal of this and it's perfectly fine.\r\n\r\nToday is father day and she forgot. She didn't want to get out of bed so I got up to take care of the kids. They were taking candy without permission so it wasn't really a good morning. Made some coffee and after a while my wife got out of bed, took some coffee and sat with us at the table. The moment I stood up to leave for work (I work 1/2 sundays in retail) she realised that she forgot and she and the kids rushed to get their gifts. I didn't have a lot of time but the gifts and poems were fun. \r\n\r\nShe does feel guilty, wants to make up for it and asks me if there's anything she can do for me. I suggest that a BBQ would be great but there wouldn't be enough time since I only come home around 7pm but our youngest has to be in bed at 7:30pm. She suggests to prepare and light the fire in advance so we can get straight to grilling when I arrive. Great plan! I tell here it will take about 45 minutes to heat up.\r\n\r\nI call her around 4pm to ask her about something completely unrelated and I hear that she's on a boat with her family to celebrate father day, of course I'm happy for them. Before I hang up I remind her about the bbq and that it would be best to light it up around 6:15pm. No problem!\r\n\r\nSo I arrive a bit after 7pm and noone is home. The wood is stacked in the bbq but not burning. I call her but she doesn't pick up. I get frustrated and pissed off. Even though I'm usually a laid back guy it really got to me. I put the wood back and cleaned up a bit. After 10 minutes I decided to take a walk and while I was walking down the street she turned up with the kids and honked. I made a confused expression and continued walking.\r\n\r\nNow she's pissed off at me telling that we still had time to bbq. I remind her that the kids will be in bed by the time I can even start. She apologises and explains that she didn't control the boat. And that it was her father his father day. I told her I'm gonna keep walking for a while. \r\n\r\nAITA?",

            "comment": "NTA. \n\nLook, this is just my opinion. But when you have someone who is the father to YOUR KIDS. They take precedent on Father's Day. Same thing on Mother's day. It's nice, of course, to acknowledge your own parents, or have a joint get together. But when you are an adult with children with your SPOUSE. Your spouse is now your priority. \n\nIt sounds like, and correct me if I'm wrong, you're really hurt by the fact that your wife not only didn't put you first on Father's Day, but that she is so forgetful that this isn't an uncommon experience? You say you don't make a \"big deal\" out of these holidays... But she made a big enough deal to go and get on a boat with her parents and your kids without telling you about it??? Or even INVITING you? Why weren't YOU, the *literal father of her children*, invited to celebrate Father's Day with the family?\n\nI'm not a father, so I can't relate exactly. But what I can say is that I cannot imagine my spouse EVER doing something like this to me (forgetting something, then messing it up so badly AND going to *a totally different celebration and not telling me or inviting me* and then being PISSED when I'm upset???). \n\nI think you and your wife need to sit down and have a SERIOUS talk. And couple's counseling. Don't let resentment build... Although my guess is that, if this happens a lot, it already has.",

Suggest she takes some time, and puts all of your important dates in it, and uses the reminder function. \n\nI have a terrible memory, and this is how I don't miss events. I even set it to remind me a week ahead of time, so I have plenty of warning that something is happening.",

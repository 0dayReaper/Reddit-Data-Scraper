    "postText": "Tldr My roommate broke her toe after going out for bouldering. I\u2019ve went out of my way to help pick her up her crutches, order her food/cook for her, pick up her deliveries and clean up after her. \nI was there to cheer her up when she got upset about her injury and started to cry. We were super close friends, that is I really consider her as a close sister than friend. \n\nHowever yesterday, she invited her friend to our place, and asked if I want to order something from the same restaurant they are gonna order. I said yes, and ordered a tomyum soup, and offered for pick up. But I was still at the office, knowing I won\u2019t be back till 7, her friend picked up for us. \n\nAnd on my way home, she texted me that they actually ate up my soup, that there was nothing left. Didn\u2019t know how to react, (I honestly was in disbelief, thought she was joking) and after confirming that they really did, I said I\u2019m good, just gonna heat up some food in the fridge. And she insist to order another tomyum soup, I said no please, she said she already ordered.\n\nThen when I came back home, feeling upset abt the forced generosity, I didn\u2019t laugh when they explain abt how they ended up finishing my food, that the soup was great I should try it when it arrives( I honestly couldn\u2019t care less) \nThen when her friend abt to head out, the order finally arrived, she asked me to pick it up, laughing as if it\u2019s something funny\ud83e\udee0\nHer friend asked if there\u2019s anything they can do, she said it\u2019s okay just put their used dishes in the sink.\n\nAnd guess what, playing the \u201cpoor me \u201ccard, I will have to clean up their shit.\n\nI figured that I just can\u2019t take it anymore, asked her to clean up her stuff while I clean up the piled up garbage mountain(we haven\u2019t been able to clean them regularly bc I am off work most of the time as it piles up. And I cleaned it up literally 3 days ago. \nAnd she act as if she is in great pain while cleaning up stuff, I said, you are making me uncomfortable, and she answered: \u201cthat\u2019s the point!\u201d \n\nI put that bag of tomyum soup that arrived late to her fridge section, and refused to drink it when she offered to heat it up for me. (I said no thanks, and again the forced generosity\u2026 she said she already heated up for me smh) and I just left it on the table.\n\nthis whole thing just makes me so so uncomfortable that I simply can\u2019t bear to spend time with her in the same house anymore. I want to try spend most of my time at my friends place or just find a cafe shop and get home as late as I can lol. I know she needs help but I don\u2019t want to burn myself to keep others warm.\n\nAITA? She\u2019s clearly in pain but I don\u2019t want to help at all.",

She\u2019s gotten used to you helping around and unfortunately in certain scenarios she\u2019s going to act like she\u2019s always in pain or there\u2019s something wrong with her constantly so that you feel bad and do things for her.

This is one of the situations where you seemingly have options but really you don\u2019t. When your friend text you to pick up their crutch, you can\u2019t say pick it up yourself, right? When someone ask if you could drive her to office you can\u2019t say no I have my plans just call Uber, right? For however a shitty person I may sound like, I am still a living being with compassion. I do those not because I want her to pay me back I the future, but I hear her groaning as she walk with crutches, and she indeed treated me good as a roommate. So of course I volunteered. \ud83d\ude05 but this \u201csoup\u201d thing got me thinking if I really mattered to her as a friend, cus you wouldn\u2019t play the nice host to your visitor and leave all the dirty work to this other friend who  clearly offered more. And you wouldn\u2019t forget that they didn\u2019t happily do all this and you can joke about, and forget your etiquette. Yes friends are friends, but if I had a friend like myself, I would put her feeling really on top of others. That is, when someone said, can I eat her food, I will say, let\u2019s order another one, she\u2019s on her way home.",

We were super close friends, that is I really consider her as a close sister than friend. \n\nHowever yesterday, she invited her friend to our place, and asked if I want to order something from the same restaurant they are gonna order. I said yes, and ordered a tomyum soup, and offered for pick up. But I was still at the office, knowing I won\u2019t be back till 7, her friend picked up for us. \n\nAnd on my way home, she texted me that they actually ate up my soup, that there was nothing left. Didn\u2019t know how to react, (I honestly was in disbelief, thought she was joking) and after confirming that they really did, I said I\u2019m good, just gonna heat up some food in the fridge. And she insist to order another tomyum soup, I said no please, she said she already ordered.\n\nThen when I came back home, feeling upset abt the forced generosity, I didn\u2019t laugh when they explain abt how they ended up finishing my food, that the soup was great I should try it when it arrives( I honestly couldn\u2019t care less) \nThen when her friend abt to head out, the order finally arrived, she asked me to pick it up, laughing as if it\u2019s something funny\ud83e\udee0\nHer friend asked if there\u2019s anything they can do, she said it\u2019s okay just put their used dishes in the sink.\n\nAnd guess what, playing the \u201cpoor me \u201ccard, I will have to clean up their shit.\n\nI figured that I just can\u2019t take it anymore, asked her to clean up her stuff while I clean up the piled up garbage mountain(we haven\u2019t been able to clean them regularly bc I am off work most of the time as it piles up. And I cleaned it up literally 3 days ago. \nAnd she act as if she is in great pain while cleaning up stuff, I said, you are making me uncomfortable, and she answered: \u201cthat\u2019s the point!\u201d \n\nI put that bag of tomyum soup that arrived late to her fridge section, and refused to drink it when she offered to heat it up for me. (I said no thanks, and again the forced generosity\u2026 she said she already heated up for me smh) and I just left it on the table.\n\nthis whole thing just makes me so so uncomfortable that I simply can\u2019t bear to spend time with her in the same house anymore. I want to try spend most of my time at my friends place or just find a cafe shop and get home as late as I can lol. I know she needs help but I don\u2019t want to burn myself to keep others warm.\n\nAITA? She\u2019s clearly in pain but I don\u2019t want to help at all.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Taped it and figured out the best way to get around, definitely uncomfortable bc I was walking on the side of my foot or walking heel first. I was fortunate that is was summer and I could get away with wearing sandals that way my foot didn\u2019t hit the top of a shoe; though looking back at that now probably wasn\u2019t the best idea, could have sprained or broken my ankle with how I was walking to keep pressure off of it. \n\nAnd not for nothing but I just had c-section 4 weeks ago, and they tell you to take it easy and not overdo it. I\u2019ve been doing everything i did before having my baby, cleaning, cooking, taking my oldest to school, and other activities. Am I sore? Yes, but my husband doesn\u2019t get home till about 7pm and things need to get done. She\u2019s taking advantage of you and milking this bc she knows you\u2019ll do these things. Just stop doing things for her. Pick a day to go somewhere, turn your phone off and just relax. She\u2019ll have to figure out how to do things without your assistance.

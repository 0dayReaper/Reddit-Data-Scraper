    "postText": "I (19m) finished my first year of biomedical engineering at college, and at my school BME majors must either do a minor or go pre-med. I really want to minor in industrial design because I like drawing and want to design medical equipment, and I'm considering adding that minor, instead of doing pre-med. But my parents, especially my dad, wants me to go pre-med. Keep in mind that neither of them are doctors or do anything medical. He said that it's more rigorous than industrial design, and a better complement for my BME major. He also told me that I will make more money if I go into med school and get a job as a doctor. \n\nNow like I said, I'd rather do a minor than go pre-med. I don't want to spend the next 15 years of my life in med school. In terms of cost, both my parents work high paying jobs, and they told me that they are able to pay for most or even all of my education.\n\nMy parents were once again nagging me about doing pre-med. I told them that my thoughts about why I don't want to do it, but they insisted that I should do it because it makes money and because they really want one of their kids to become a doctor. I have two older siblings (26m and 23m), neither of whom did pre-med, and my parents didn't push them into pre-med or med school. They work in high paying software engineering jobs, and my parents are very proud of them. I also have two younger siblings (16f and 15f), neither of whom want to do pre-med but my parents are also fine with that. One of them wants to study business, the other aerospace engineering. For a very long time my parents were vocal that they wanted one of their kids to be a doctor, and my parents are forcing it on me, and only me.\n\nI told my parents that they never force my siblings to do med school, and that they are taking advantage of me because I'm a BME major (none of my siblings do or want to do majors remotely related to bio/chem/health). I explained how stressful pre-med and applying for med school is, not to mention pre-med and all the training itself. My mom said that it was my choice to do BME, and that out of their 5 kids, I'm the best candidate for going pre-med because of my major. I was pretty agitated, and told them that I chose BME because I want to design medical equipment and prosthetics, not because I want them to manipulate me into med school. Then my dad got furious and said that they are not \"manipulating\" me, but that being a doctor is something high-paying, and that it's for my own good, and that it brings pride to the family. I said that it's my education and my choice, and that they need to treat me as nicely as they treat my siblings. Then my parents lost it, and things have been very heated since then.",

Their parents had bragged about 'my son the priest' and suddently, their son wasn't a priest or anything .  The relationships were wrecked and these sons often couldn't come home again.   some men decided to wait until their parents died before they could leave the priesthood - decades of a life wasted",

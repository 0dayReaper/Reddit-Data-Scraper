It sounds like she's a pretty entitled AH from what you're describing.",

If we come together, we leave together unless you already have plans before we leave (sometimes they'd go home with their SO). If at any time you are with someone new (this was at all times, ex. met at the club, first date, random encounter at a grocery store) we shared their license plate and Vin numbers, as well as their full name and driver's license number. Text when (and where) you make it, and when you get home.  Also, before my true crime obsession.",

Everyone gets to choose how to spend their free time, you weren't obligated to go on the trip, but she doesn't seem worth it.",

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nFor context, one of my girlfriends turned 30 this year and decided to plan a \u201cbirthday week\u201d in the south of France with a few of her friends (none of us knew each other before and the only friend we had in common was bday girl). The trip was in the French Riviera and the big night was Saturday, which is her birthday. She wanted to go to an expensive restaurant and then a famous club around Cannes.\n\nThe week starts off well and we all make an effort to get along and make bday girl happy. Saturday rolls in (it\u2019s her birthday) and we surprise her with cake in bed and a gift we had planned in advance. In the evening we\u2019re all getting ready and she keeps telling us we need to be faster so she can catch good lighting to take pictures, which breaks the mood a bit but we get over it.\n\nWe then go to this famous restaurant and mid-way through the meal she asks if she can swap places with me because I was closer to the action (I was more towards the centre of the restaurant floor, if that makes sense). I say no worries and we swap places, but while we try to spark a nice conversation and play fun games, she keeps says \u201ctake a picture of me, take a picture of me\u201d. We oblige (it\u2019s her bday) and we even ask the waiters if they could bring out a cake and some tiny fireworks for her (which they do).\n\nWe then leave the restaurant and go to this club. Within 2 minutes of getting in she meets a random guy and disappears. We try to find her, text her to make sure she\u2019s okay, and nothing. Then she shows up ~1hr later with said guy and tells us she\u2019s going home with him.\n\nWe tried to make sure she was okay and asked her to share her location with us (she never did), but after she left we didn\u2019t see any reason to stay in the club so we just left.\n\nWe really tried to make an effort the whole week to be sociable even though we didn\u2019t know each other (only knew bday girl) and in the end I think we just felt underwhelmed and frustrated since we\u2019re also paying a lot of money for the holiday (we\u2019re not from France).\n\nAre we assholes?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I wouldn't blame you in the slightest if you didn't join her for her next trip or \"birthday week\" or invite her to your events or whatever.\n\nHowever, reading your post sounds a bit like you're complaining about everything and being a downer. You're about 30 years old. You can enjoy your trip to France without depending on your host. You're being an AH by being miserable about her enjoying her birthday week how she wants. You don't get to call and yell at her (you can gently criticize her for not maintaining communication). You can let her know that this week didn't go as you expected and you don't want to go on a future trip like this, but make the best of it.",

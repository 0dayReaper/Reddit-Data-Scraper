    "postText": "I (F19), live with my parents because I'm attending college in my home state. Both my parents have short tempers, but over the years I've learned to manage it. Whenever something happens between those two, I remove myself from that situation. That is the only way for me to avoid confrontation (which I hate).  \nUnlike them, I am a mostly calm person. Sometimes, my family members are shocked as to how I am just level-headed, even when all hell breaks loose, but last night was different. \n\nWhile sitting down for dinner my mother(F44) asked me to put salt on my father's plate, like I usually do. My father(M49) likes salt on his plate on the side, while having dinner. It hasn't bothered me, until last month, when I found out, his BP is on the rise. \n\nI generally put less salt on his plate and tell him that if he needs more, I'll give it to him. Last night, once I gave him the salt, he got all angry, but it wasn't his desired amount. He got up from his chair, and loudly said \"Give me the salt you f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*g B\\*\\*\\*\\*h\".\n\nWhen I heard that, I was just left frozen to my damn core. I did not expect him to say that to me. I could not take it, and out of anger slammed the table, screaming \"You cannot abuse me!\", which led to me dropping a bowl full of rice, a huge fight between us and things turned ugly compared to the usual. My father and I are not talking since then and is making it all about the bowl of rice. He is not ready to accept that what he did hurt my feelings. Even if I'm his daughter I deserve to be respected.    \n   \nMy mother thinks I took it too far, but my aunt is on my side. Was I the asshole for retaliating??",

He should take that responsibility on himself if he wants to be medically unwise with it. You did what your conscience would allow. \n\nAs for you, you have been raised by very emotionally unstable people. It may seem like you have gotten through unaffected because compared to them you are level headed and non confrontational but in reality you are traumatised and withdrawn from living in an emotionally unsafe environment your whole life. Build a plan to move away from your parents, ask around at your school for share housing options, apply for jobs, if there is any financial help for therapy through your school etc please look into it. \n\nAlso be careful of being drawn to similarly confrontational people, look into attachment style and abuse cycles and apply safety measures when or if you approach relationships in the future.",

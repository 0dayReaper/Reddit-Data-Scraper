    "postText": "I [29F] dated a guy Joe (30M) for 3 months before he left me to go back to his ex Kim (30F). Right after we broke up I found out I was pregnant and now I\u2019m at 24 weeks. I let him know and he was ecstatic. Turns out his girlfriend had fertility issues and would likely never be able to get pregnant naturally and he has always wanted to be a father. Getting back together was out of the question for both of us so he\u2019s still with his girlfriend. \n\nJoe was only allowed at the initial appointment because of COVID-19 and we found out I was having twins. According to Joe when he told Kim she had a mental breakdown about her infertility, and wanted to talk to me. I met them at their house and Kim stated that she wanted to be involved in my pregnancy because she would eventually be the children\u2019s stepmother. She started telling me that I needed to do a home birth, that I needed to formula feed so that they could have the babies half of the week, that she wanted one boy and one girl, and that she wanted the kid to call her Mama since they would be calling me Mommy. I shut her down and said I would make the best choices for my children and my body and left. \n\nKim continued to be overbearing and texting me everyday about my eating habits, exercise habits, and bitching about how her job wouldn\u2019t let her take maternity leave. At the virtual genetics counseling appointment, she attended instead of Joe and took over the whole meeting trying to talk about her family history which wasn\u2019t relevant. When it came time for my 20 week level 2 scan, they allowed me one guest and Joe suggested I take Kim instead of him, which I refused to do. Joe did end up coming and he found out the gender because I wanted to keep it a surprise for me so we could throw a gender reveal party. I put a pregnancy announcement on my social media and then she put up an announcement saying they were expecting twins \u201cthe non-traditional way\u201d and how blessed she was. I was irritated but I kept my mouth shut. Then she threw a gender reveal party and posted it on social media. I wasn\u2019t even invited. She also announced that she\u2019s having a baby shower. I commented on her posts and told her to stop treating me like a surrogate, that the kids weren\u2019t hers, and that Joe didn\u2019t have any claim or custody of the kids until they are born. I then called Joe and reiterated all of this and stated that I would not be seeing either of them until we went to family court and that my mother would be my birthing partner. He and Kim and some of her friends and family are saying I\u2019m an asshole and her mother even called and insisted I give her one of my babies like this is the Parent Trap? So AITA?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m definitely getting a lawyer ASAP. Y\u2019all have scared the shit out of me but I\u2019m happy you did.\n\nUPDATE: I never considered that this could\u2019ve happened on purpose. We used condoms because I do not react well to hormonal birth control and I had to wait to get a non-hormonal IUD because of other medical issues. The Thursday I posted this, I went to the police and they stated that there was nothing they could do because a crime hadn\u2019t been committed. In my state orders of protection are criminal or family so I was able to get one against Joe. On Friday, I did get a lawyer and they let me know in my state there was nothing I could do as far as custody before the babies are born, so I will be leaving my state soon to ensure that this isn\u2019t my babies home state and I can\u2019t be charged with anything. \nHowever, someone sent this post to Kim and she came to my job, damaged my car, and broke a bunch of office windows. I work with kids so she was arrested for not just the criminal damage and trespassing but also child endangerment so hopefully that works in my favor. Also if Joe did it on purpose, I don\u2019t think Kim knew, because she was screaming at me about how I stole her life and everything I had was supposed to be hers.\n\nUpdate: I have orders of protection against both Kim and Joe. I left the state anyway and Joe and Kim started harassing me again because there\u2019s no legal jurisdiction when you leave the state, but I have enough evidence that I was able to press charges in my current state as well and will be pursuing a restraining order here.",

Make it clear you are concerned for the well-being of yourself and your children, and INSIST that you will not allow her around your children, once born, due to her mental instability related to her own infertility, as she has basically threatened to kidnap your children and pass them off as her own, as she has LIED and claimed that you are their surrogate and intend to give them up for adoption to them - of which you have ZERO INTENTION AND NEVER HAVE. Make sure the police are aware of this, and of the \u201cparent trap\u201d suggestion. They need to know she is unstable and dangerous.

Home birth with twins - no matter where in the world you reside, it is never recommended you have a home birth with twins. Twin births automatically make you high risk. Higher risk of gestational diabetes, higher risk of post partum haemorrhage and higher risk of pre-term labour. \n\n2. The fact that you think she has called you a surrogate, means she intends on either becoming the only mother in this situation (e.g. kills you) or she intends on alienating your children, taking you to court and calling CPS until you can't take it anymore. \n\nYou need to move away to your family in the south. Like Yesterday. Because those babies could come at any time from now up to 38 weeks. The same day they are born, you could be served with papers that Joe and Kim intend on taking you to court to gain visitation on their grounds. \n\nWhen you move, leave everything behind - don't tell your neighbours where you are moving to, don't give names or addresses. Set up mail redirection to your new place and GET OUT. Save your life and that of your precious babies. \n\nI really hope to see an update that you have left and that you are safe.",

You\u2019re from the South, come on home darlin! (I live in the South also [think SE/Gulf states] and will be more than happy to help/be a friend/confidant/supporter. I truly mean that with my whole heart.) Otherwise, you will be stuck alone and bullied/harassed by Hoe, his gf and their families/friends. This is unnerving on many levels. \n\n2. Lawyer up ASAP. DO NOT put his name on birth certificate and DO NOT allow either of them to be a part of ANYTHING. If you do allow them, that can hurt your case while helping theirs. \n\n3. BREASTFEED! BREASTFEED! BREASTFEED! I say this bc NO JUDGE will remove a child solely being breastfed. This also means NO OVER NIGHTS AWAY FROM MUMMA since you are the only source of nutrients for your little ones (My husband is an investigator and works a great deal of domestic/custody cases. We see this all the time.) \n\n4. The further along you get, please, PLEASE always have someone with you and NEVER, EVER meet Joe &amp; GF or GF alone. Anyone as desperate as GF will go to any, and I mean ANY lengths to \u201chave a child of their own.\u201d I am in no way trying to alarm you or make you fearful; however, I do want you to be very cautious as things like this happen far too often. **Once Joe and GF realize you are laying down boundaries be prepared for peak obsession. GF is going to flip her shit and is capable of trying to get your babies from you or FROM you.**\n\nI am genuinely worried about you.

Also if Joe got custody in the state you\u2019re in you could be prevented from moving with the kids later. This is the kind of scary story where you worry that the mother is going to get killed so the other couple can take the children. Wherever you go get security cameras installed. Not only on your home but also get a dashboard camera for your car. Make sure someone always knows where you are and where you\u2019re going. Create documented list of your fears and their actions leave them in a safe place like a safety deposit box And make sure that your mother or someone you trust has access to that. Don\u2019t be afraid to keep going to the police even if they can\u2019t do anything there is an ongoing record of your harassment.",

They may prefer to spend time there, may act up with you more, she may drill into their heads that *she* is the real mother, you will have no control over what is being said to the kids about you during his custody time. \n\nHe is the father, so for me I would say if he wants to participate in their lives then he comes to see them where you are, without her.

Joe may be the biological father of these children, but the way they are behaving before YOUR children are even born is quite scary.\n\nBefore you hatch your kids and are flooded with hormones, sleep deprived, and exhausted beyond all reason, you NEED to get a consult with the nastiest, most bloodthirsty shark of a family law attorney in your area.... And I would suggest you do so, yesterday.\n\nFollow your attorney's advice to the letter. I would not give Joe/Kim ANY more information, and would force them to go through legal channels for every single scrap of information.\n\nKim is legit crazy. I would put NOTHING past her (she honestly sounds like she wants to steal your children and cut you out of their lives ASAP). Joe is no better.\n\nDo not give these psychos any more information, time, or attention than your lawyer says is legally required.  I would even wait until Joe goes to court to establish paternity and make him fight for every single visit.\n\nSurround yourself with YOUR tribe of supportive people, nobody REMOTELY connected with Joe or Kim (definitely not Joe's mom). Lean on them for support. \n\nIt's time to get mad; full Mama Bear Mode. Fight for your kids... Because Psycho Kim is already establishing that SHE is the \"Mom\", and you are just an incubator for HER children.\n\nNone of this is REMOTELY normal or even okay.\n\nI know it's scary.

It\u2019s you and your kids first.  My ex and his new wife harassed me and then went to court claiming I was mentally unfit. They harassed me to the point that it almost worked. If they hadn\u2019t got caught in a lie to the judge and if I hadn\u2019t had family around working with me and for me to help me keep my kids, it would have gone south fast.  It eventually did go so south, far beyond what I want to share.  Be wary that your ex and Kim might try to take you out of the picture. If they can drive you mental, they\u2019ll use anything against you they can. Watch who you\u2019ve allowed to see your social media and watch what you post. Also, I wouldn\u2019t put it past them to steal what you\u2019re sharing and make it their own. \n\nIf you can move to where you\u2019re near family and your home territory, do it now while you can\u2019t be bound by court order to stay. You\u2019ll have help and resources that will help you with what could be 18+ years of fighting for your kids and your own well-being.   I know you want to be nice and fair to your ex because these are his kids too, but he\u2019s shown you so far that he\u2019s less concerned with being their father and more about allowing Kim to be their \u201cmother.\u201d  You only need share whatever is going on with the kids when they are born, paternity has been established, and a court order in place.  Let him take the initiative to being a father and meet him at the point he\u2019s willing to come to. Don\u2019t overextend yourself out of kindness. He\u2019s taking advantage of that.  If he hasn\u2019t stepped up to make Kim his wife and make that part of the kids life stable, there\u2019s a chance he won\u2019t ever and if they break up, Kim is going to lose her shit when she can\u2019t play Mama anymore. She won\u2019t have any legal standing to be in the kids\u2019 life and her behavior now clues in that she might go off the deep end.   \n\nSo far your post has shown that the ball is rolling on how crazy things can be with your ex and Kim. As a mother you\u2019re going to need to be 10 steps ahead of their plans. It will be far easier to play offense than it will to play defense.",

DEFINITELY move. After your children are born you will very likely be stuck wherever you are because of custody. And I say contact a lawyer first so that you can prevent them from suing you as soon as you move. Get a restraining order against the girlfriend. These are your children, and as much as it might be a dick move to alienate the father, you have to realize that he has put you in a position where you don\u2019t actually have much of a choice. Do you want to risk them alleging that you as a single mother can\u2019t properly take care of twins and therefore, the father, in a stable relationship, should have majority or sole custody? Because I can guarantee you, if you\u2019re not very careful about what your next moves are, they can very easily do this. Honestly, even IF this turns out to be blown out of proportion and they end up being chill, you having most or sole custody will do no harm, you can always decide to let them be a bigger part of your children\u2019s lives in the future if you think that\u2019s warranted. So you have nothing to lose by taking action now.\n\nI haven\u2019t been on reddit in months, and this post made the media and it freaked me out enough to prompt me to log in and comment.

Please protect yourself and those babies. \n\nAnd their family telling you your should give up one of your babies to them??? They\u2019re insane. Print and date those too.",

She needs to respect that she is not their mother and just because Joe is her boyfriend doesn\u2019t mean his kids are hers. Do what\u2019s best for you and stay away from them and her family.",

You're being targeted for your children, being treated as an incubator, and they're trying to control you. The home birth thing is super suspicious and I remember seeing Marlen's killer making Facebook posts about the nursery, and names, and how she's was deluded thinking a strangers child belonged to her. The gender reveal party, \"expecting in the 'non traditional way'\" shows that this woman, who has no relation to your children, through blood or marriage, already sees them as hers. Get a restraining order against her before they get married and jump state lines immediately. Don't put his name on the birth certificate",

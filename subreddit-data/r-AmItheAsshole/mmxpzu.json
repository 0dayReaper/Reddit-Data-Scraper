I went &amp; obtained a judgement against my ex for over $80,000 in back child support but when (actually if) he wanted visitation I was to turn the girls over. In my divorce papers, it did say visitation was at my discretion so I could deny visitation at times  - especially if he gave me less than 24 hrs notice. \nWe seperated in July '04 &amp;divorced in Oct '05. The girls were 7&amp;5 when we separated. They were 9&amp;7 when I remarried. From July 04 to the time they both turned 18, I only denied visitation once. He thought he was being funny when he asked for visitation the same weekend I was getting married. He knew the girls were in the wedding. (That tells you what kind of SOB dead beat dad he is)\nBy the time the youngest turned 18, he owed me over $150,000 in back support \nSo, yeah, I know from experience child support &amp; visitation are 2 completely separate issues",

They seem crazy and desperate enough, after all it\u2019s their chance to get not one, but TWO babies. \n\nGhost them. Assume slut status while you were with him, fake a miscarriage, find a male friend to act as the future father to accompany you around, do what u need to get Joe and Kim out of your life NOW. \n\nJoe is not a father, no real father would set their children up to a lifetime of hell. He\u2019s nothing but a sperm donor at best. He has none of your interest at heart, is just using you and also just wants your baby. I fear for you. I fear for all the nights you will be crying yourself to sleep that you let these people into you and your twins lives. They are the definition of toxic. \n\nA restraining order against her, isn\u2019t going to keep her away from the babies. If you give him any parental rights, he\u2019ll only use it to enable her. Given what\u2019s happen so far, they\u2019ll corrupt your children and poison them against you. Courts can\u2019t control what happens behind doors.  \n\nI read a previous disturbing post of teacher noticing a child regressing so bad in school that she started wetting herself, she was about 7? She was a child of a rape. Although the mother had a restraining order against him, the grandparents fought for visitation and courts awarded it. Turns out the grandparents were sneaking the child off and handing her to the father, who was inappropriately touching her. \n\nYou are at a critical fork in the road, practically between life and death, that what you do now will define for the rest of your days if you will live a happy or miserable life. Twins are amazing and they do not deserve him or any exposure to this toxicity. \n\nOh and NTA, but you are sadly dealing with the king and queen of TAs. \n\nGood luck \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

This Kim is acting very possessive over two kids she has 0 relation too. Her and Joe are by no means married, neither were you and Joe (Unless there's more you haven't written, but it's implied you were just dating?) \n\nFrom an outside perspective, Kim is getting very attached to a complete strangers children. It's creepy and disturbing, and her behaviour warrants extreme caution. Keep a paper trail, and keep your distance. \n\nI'd be restricting visits as much as possible, and informing close friends and family so you have a verbal witness to your intentions, in case Kim starts saying otherwise. \n\nThis is levels of disturbing I wasn't prepared for. Especially when the mother suggested you give Kim one of your *children,* like it's a freaking *object*.\n\nPlease update us so we know things went well, I'm genuinely worried for your safety.",

Put out a violence restraining order and if possible a request for psychiatric intervention on her behalf.  Make sure to fill in an affidavit for the police about the mysteriously non working condoms, the claims to her family of you being a surrogate, the harassment, the demands to have a home birth. The talking about her family health issues at YOUR pregnancy check.\n\nYour fears for your safety anywhere near her and your worry that if you are alone with her while giving birth, that you won\u2019t survive and the babies will vanish. \n\nMake sure to include in the affidavit that you do NOT have a surrogacy agreement with her and it has never been discussed. You had never even met her till after the unexpected pregnancy.\n\n5. name your mother legal guardian of you and the children, make sure that it is filed before the birth.\n\n6. notify the hospital that the 2 of them are NOT allowed anywhere near you or the babies. They are not allowed to get a dna test done, they are not allowed to fill in the birth certificate. Due to the chance of the female stealing the babies as \u2018her own.\u201d\n\n7. Just to make sure that there are a lot of people who know about it, tell the entire story to the local TV station and newspapers. \n\n7a. first get pictures of them and their family and friends from the accounts so you have as many clear pictures to show people as possible , in case they send others to \u2018check\u2019 on you. Keep copies to show anyone who asks about it.\n\n7b.NAME THEM. Show them the social media posts. ( This type of story will go viral and if anything happens to you or the children, they will be the immediate suspects) Hopefully this will make at least some of their friends/family question what is going on. It will certainly make some of the locals keep an eye out for you. (and purely accidently, get reporters turning up to question them and their families. If you can get a politician involved , even better. Female rights, pro-life. )\n\n7c. Do NOT let them hide your face, you need as many locals as possible to know you by sight, so anyone asking about you will make them suspicious.\n\n7d. Point out that only your family and friends you trust know your location, so anyone asking for it, is NOT one of them.\n\n7e. once this goes public, They are unlikely to get Away with this with anyone else.\n\n7f. They claim slander, tell them to explain publicly why she the infertile girlfriend is claiming that the babies are hers.\n\n8. organize with locals to always have people with you, whether in your family home or outside. This way the two of them will have a harder time getting near you.\n\nYes you will sound paranoid but if it\u2019s your health and your babies, be as paranoid as you want.\n\n9. no idea about the law in the US but, can you sue him for deliberately getting you pregnant?\n\nSue for damages for Any health issues which come up because of the UNPLANNED pregnancy?\n\nSue her for stress and potential harm to the children because of her harassment and stalking.\n\n10. Check the surrogacy laws in your state(both of them) make sure that you know these off by heart and your lawyer is able to argue that they seem to be treating this unplanned, mysterious(how did the condoms fail) pregnancy as a surrogacy.  You were not planing on getting pregnant but now you have , you will keep YOUR children.\n\n11. optional:If they haven\u2019t spotted you before then, try and spread around a rumour that the babies were born with the cords in an awkward position and you have to wait to see if there\u2019s any lifelong problems. (or similar .make them not want unhealthy children which will come with major bills) \n\nYes I am this nasty. They are treating you as an object , they need to be stomped on hard to stop them from doing it to you and to stop them from doing it to anyone else.",

In Illinois at least, if two people are having a child and are not married, the father has to complete paperwork that you (as the mother) sign off on to legally has the state and by extension the federal government recognize him as their father. Without the state/federal recognition he has no rights to your children, and it can be amended if you ever want to add him in the future (which you probably shouldn\u2019t even if your kids do have a relationship with their sperm donor).\n\nAlso talk to your lawyer about preemptively contacting DCFS/child welfare agencies because you are clearly fearful of you and your childrens\u2019 safety, and once again knowledge is in Illinois Law but they help people in situations of domestic violence to protect themselves and their kids. \n\nNo matter what, do whatever keeps you and your children safe.

            "comment": "1. Congratulations, you\u2019re a mom! \n\n2. I write threat assessment protocols for vulnerable populations. You and your children are in danger and extremely vulnerable. I hope this helps. Speaking as a professional and child with a disability who was the rope in a custody tug of war for +20 years, you\u2019re absolutely NTA; you\u2019re a parent. Kim and Joe are not. Providing sperm and throwing gender reveal parties DOES NOT make someone a parent. A parent puts their child\u2019s needs before their own agenda. You are the parent. Others in this situation are threats. (I know what I\u2019m talking about because I was born with a disability, lived this nightmare until I was 20 years old when I finally proved to case managers and family court that I could make my own medical decisions. +20 years of similar shit that began before I took my first breath. It was terrifying and infuriating because I felt so damned invisible and helpless.) Let me help you prevent that happening to you and your children. \n\n3. You\u2019re listening to your instincts early. Trust your judgment. Protect yourself and your children. Kim and Joe are treating you worse than a surrogate and planning to take your children. Have 911 on speed dial. Always tell confidants were you going, share your schedule and text them frequently. Use safe words when you text/email so they KNOW it\u2019s you. If you don\u2019t use the safe word, they call police. \n\n4. Get a good family lawyer, RUN, find support, disappear. You have probable cause for a protection order. Get one. If they violate it, call the police and your attorney EVERY SINGLE TIME they do. (You will need that if they try to prove you\u2019re unfit. \n\n5.  Document everything until your children are 18 years old and I do mean everything\u2014texts, every communication, even the bills you pay. You will need that in case they try to say your an unfit parent. Use a budget so you can prove you have a plan and can provide for your yourself and your children. Document that you moved to protect yourself and your children because Joe and Kim want to take your children and excluded you from activities which magnifies their intent\u2014not because you want to alienate the biological father from the babies. He hasn\u2019t really expressed an interest in your health or your appointments. Kim does. Given her posts, they intend to alienate you and prioritize their needs over your children\u2019s. If their intent good, they would include you\u2014not abuse you. \n\n6. Don\u2019t talk to them without witnesses EVER! Hide your location. Do not be alone with Joe, his family or Kim. Meet Joe in a neutral location\u2014not Kim because she doesn\u2019t have any parental rights. They\u2019ve announced their intent with a megaphone repeatedly. They intend to take your children. BLOCK THEM! They\u2019re abusive and dismissive to you and will put you and your children in danger. Kim didn\u2019t even allow you to discuss your health issues during your appointment with your genetic counselor. It was all about her. She trashed your car, your workplace and put other children in danger. She is an abuser. Because Joe enables her and prioritizes Kim\u2019s wants over you and the children\u2019s health and well-being, he is a threat.\n\n7. You and your babies\u2019 health and safety is a parent\u2019s first priority. Protect yourself and them!\n\n7. Don\u2019t put his name on the birth certificates and don\u2019t give them his last name. \n\n8. Write a custody plan before they\u2019re born with supervised visitation only if you you must, get a durable medical power of attorney so your ex can\u2019t make decisions for you or your children EVER. \n\n9. Your a mom now, doing everything you can to protect yourself and your babies from danger.",

My first used breastfeeding to help him sleep and he was breastfeeding many hours a day. With two babies they will need you 24/7. Therefore I just want to add definitely speak to a lawyer and get some representation. Plus, small infants are incredibly dependent on their mums so my opinion / advice is it\u2019s not down to you to have to Run around appeasing your ex partner. He will have to fit around you and your feeding schedule etc. Definitely get advice. If it was me I would be stipulating through a lawyer that your ex has certain times that are pre-scheduled and that he comes to you. Your babies might need feeing at any moment and you should not have to drop them off with him in my opinion. He should be coming to you for a short visit and pre- agreed times. Plus his girlfriend has no rights on your children. She can\u2019t just turn up at your house for visits. Speak to a lawyer but it should be ok to get an agreement that he and only he visits you for visits - not the girlfriend. She has no rights. Babies feed on demand when breastfed, they don\u2019t feed on certain time schedules so that is incredibly important the babies are with you 24/7 for on demand feeding and he comes to you - not you running around trying to please him. Hope that helps. Many people are on here supporting you. Much love and blessings to you. Stay strong and remember, they are your babies, you\u2019re their mum and you decide what is in their best interests xx speak to as many legal people as possible to know your rights xx",

I did not put him on their birth certificate but was forced to when I had to get state assistance for child care so I could work and be able to feed said kids on my own. \nWhen my boys were 2 their dad got a crazy girlfriend who decided to force him to meet my boys and she tried to tell me that my sons were 1/2 theirs. Uhhhhh, nope. Don't think so sunshine you have your own kids. I went to my attorney, (I'm a Teamster so good legal benefits,) and we discussed my options. In my state 3 is the age of abandonment for a parent so that was out but I did have some evidence he wasn't a fit parent. I chose to see how things played out because psycho gf and the dad were fairly predictable in their unstable behavior.\nA year later the psycho gf killed my boys dad leaving my boys unable to meet him at a mature age and decide for themselves what kind of person he is and the 2 kids they had orphans because she's in prison for life.\nMy suggestion is to get an attorney, the first 1/2 hour consultation is generally free and learn your state's/country's laws on custody. Make an educated decision on custody based on the laws and your attorney's recommendations. I hope you have pink babies and have a healthy and longish pregnancy. Twin pregnancies suck a lot but the longer they brew the better it is. Good luck mama!!!",

But at the very least definitely no situation where your kids are alone with her under any circumstances. I say supervised visits with him not because he would hurt the babies, but he seems to be really enabling her and would probably thing \"no harm if she sees them\" and let her have access if he has them alone.\n\nAnd up your home security because with her spiraling like this you have no idea where she's going to go with it.

She is not allowed to have access to your personal health information unless you have specifically allowed it, at least in the US.\n\nYou need to get an attorney, but you also need to be aware that unless he is proven to be unfit in some way, you will likely be sharing parenting time at least 50/50 at some point, and likely have joint custody so his legal decisions will hold as much weight as yours. \n\nSome family courts will order parenting time as long as the baby can take a bottle, and since exclusively breastfeeding twins is difficult without pumping and/or supplementing, this could happen sooner rather than later in your situation.\n\nI really feel for you because you\u2019re facing a very difficult situation in which you\u2019re going to be dealing with an overbearing woman and a spineless man, and having no control over what happens in their home with the kids. She sounds crazy enough to try to figure out how to stimulate lactation in herself or get those \u201cbreast friend\u201d things where it simulates breastfeeding with a tube on a prosthetic breast!",

Well done you for putting your foot down and making it clear she is NOT the mother, and has absolutely NO say in what you do with your body and children! My god I\u2019d be livid! Stay strong. If your ex can\u2019t seem that her behaviour is not only worrying but could be illegal/dangerous, then he needs to seriously think twice, as it could stop him being able to access his children!

If the money paid for registration is the issue, ask if there\u2019s a way to spend the weekend doing chores instead to earn it back. Surely the offer to morph into Cinderella for the weekend will show your mom you\u2019re serious.",

You have a problem with the behavior of the other girls in your unit.\n\nIf you're not doing a joint campout with that same unit again, then 1 is likely not an issue. \n\n2 is an issue. Have you had a unit meeting since the campout? Have you discussed the behavior of these girls with your unit leader? If they don't know there's a problem, they can't fix it.\n\nYour dad took your phone away as a punishment for you saying you're not going on the campout?\n\nI'm saying NTA - it sounds like your horrible experience from the last campout hasn't been addressed, and so there's little chance that this campout will be a good experience.",

When your mum paid for the camp, you didn\u2019t know you\u2019d most likely have a lousy experience. \n\nThe organisation let you and everyone else down by allowing leaders to bark orders and create a hostile environment. They also let you down by allowing others to bully you. (I don\u2019t know whether the screaming and yelling was problematic or not, but the making-fun-of-you definitely was.)\n\nYour mum can be disappointed, but you\u2019re not refusing to go because you\u2019re fickle, you\u2019re refusing to go because you were bullied. That\u2019s a legitimate reason. \n\nThe biggest AH is your dad for bullying you by trying to make you go and taking away your phone. He should listen to you, sympathise, help you to find coping strategies and help you draw lines in the sand when a situation is unbearable. \n\nAnd no, you do not have to give up your allowance or birthday money: if your parents cannot ensure that you won\u2019t get bullied (different camp, more oversight, leaders stopping that stuff immediately - this is a time when they should approach the organisation and have your back), they should consider the money a fee for learning that you can\u2019t trust this organisation to keep its members safe.",

    "postText": "So for some context, I (20f) have been living with my aunt (28f) for the past 11 months. I moved in with her after i was kicked out of my parents house after a huge fight. \n\nI come from a different religion which requires me to live with my parents until marriage or in this case with any relatives. Me and my aunt mostly gets along but have fights here and there \nShe is a teacher and sometimes she\u2019s really busy with school so I look after the kids (1f) and (3m). \n\nSo lately it\u2019s becoming a lot tiring to take care of two kids at the same time as they are growing older and throwing tantrums a lot, so I just leave the kids with the parents after they come home however the issue started with my aunt complaining about her being tired after work and excepts me to look after them to which I refused \n\n\nShe\u2019s now upset with me because I didn\u2019t do as she said? So Reddit, AITA for refusing to look after my cousins?\n\n\n\n( there\u2019s a lot more to the story and i tried my best to keep it short and also English isn\u2019t my first language)\n\n\nEdit- I have a disability (can\u2019t see things from 3cm distance) I\u2019ve learned to do everything on my own but as for getting a job it\u2019s difficult since most jobs aren\u2019t so considering of my condition\n\nEdit 2- i do chores and watch the kids but I meant I can\u2019t watch them all day, I need study time and me time",

I think that sounds quite reasonable exchange for not paying rent and also a lot of responsibility and psychological strain if you also need to study. Plus you do chores because you live there, that sounds also reasonable.\nI would maybe offer to cook dinner instead, if she is tired. But try to have a conversation with her. Tell her the times you already watch the kids .. that's a lot. If she had a live in au pair, she wouldn't even do that much and she would be expected to pay her pocket money for it too!\nSo the aunt should understand this. She can't exploit you unreasonably.\nBtw. Do you follow the religion so much or is it because it is expected by the family? Try to find your own job and live on your own. If you live in the West...then to *** with those conditionings.. women have to behave like almost only half human in some cultures (can't live on their own when single, as if they became wild without a man in control....what about boys, if they can live on their own, so can you!)",

What, if anything,  are you contributing to your aunt's household?\n\nYou and she should discuss your contributing something to the household. It could be baby sitting; or it could be rent, which she can then use to hire a babysitter.  But it needs to be something so that you're living with her does not continue to add to her workload.",

Please sit your aunt down and try to untangle things. \n\nDoes she have enough space to let you live there without making big sacrifices? Is her family happy with this, too?\n\nHow long did she originally think you would stay? Is she still happy about you being around?\n\nWho pays for your food and stuff? Do you pay rent? Would it be possible for your parents to pay rent so your aunt could hire a sitter from time to time?\n\nAs you are at university now, how many hours of household and child duties would be possible for you to do? Could you two make an exact plan what you are supposed to do  and when so she can relay on your help and is not constantly disappointed because her expectations were not met?\n\nNAH, but communication is key and you have to talk things through.",

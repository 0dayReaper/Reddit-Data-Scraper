Sure.  But, judging from your mother's reaction, it sounds like it had a lot of sentimental value to the family and maybe was something that should have been discussed before hand.\n\nThough I will admit to wondering how much money you could reasonably have gotten for a broken watch that was beyond repair anyway?  Even if it was gold plated?",

Because I bet they wouldn't have suggested you sell it in that case...\n\nI mean, good on them for being upfront that it wasn't objectively cost-effective to fix as a watch, but when it comes to family treasures, it's not always about what makes fiscal sense.\n\nDoes the option exist to buy the watch back from whomever bought it?  That might be something to look into, and the buyer might be sympathetic if you let them know the whole story.",

Because you don't normally sell a heirloom, cuz they have emotional values, I remember when my grandfather gave me a 1$ bill which I spent few days later, that was the last gift they were able to give me cuz they passed away 4 months later and I still regret not saving that money. It's understandable as for why your mom is angry but you can blame her at all!! She's going through the grief right now.",

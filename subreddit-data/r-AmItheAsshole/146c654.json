A lot of women are financially controlled by their husbands/partners and it makes it difficult to seek therapy. \n\nI read over your post again just to make sure I didn't misunderstand anything. I think it might be useful to try and talk about it again. Maybe even write it out? In terms of close friends sharing everything, in my experience, it's very normal. My friends and I share so many of our secrets, definitely things that we may not feel safe or want to share with partners. If it's intimate details, she may just feel more comfortable asking a friend than dealing with the embarrassment of trying to tell a professional. I think men tend to have very different relationships with their best friends than women. Unsure if that is helpful but I hope you guys get things figured out.",

She usually shares her deepest secrets including details about our marriage (eg any fights, my thought process, key developments/decisions etc) with them. I don\u2019t have a problem with she sharing any of these with 2 out of the 3 friends because I think sharing with friends is a form of therapy and get external viewpoints. However, I am not a big fan of one of her friends as I don\u2019t like her way of thinking and hence asked my wife not to share any details involving me with the 3rd friend. My wife is free to share anything with her 3rd friend that doesn\u2019t involve me. \n\nNow my wife is angry with me as and is accusing me of trying to control her friendship as she believes she can only be close friends with people if she can share her deepest secrets with them.

But sounds like she's just talking to friends about conversations you've had or perhaps your perspective on things. \n\nI just find it weird that your boundaries are about a specific person. Not about topic. \n\nSuch as....I don't share sexual details with my girlfriends....even though my friends sometimes ask.\n\nBecause that is a boundary I agree upon with my partner. But I know couples who are open about that.",

    "postText": " Throwaway account.  \nI, (16f) Had gotten picked up by a friend (Keoni, 18m, fake name) to watch our high school graduation; them being a senior and me a sophomore. Graduation was beautiful, everyone was very happy and I thought I would be getting a ride home from that same friend.  \nAfter the graduation, I get in the car with my friend, aannndd we drive to a bathroom near our school. Okay-they need a bathroom break. But after the bathroom, there is some confusion and frantic phone calls and it turns out that my friend is going to the graduation party and I would have to wait in the dark, scary area of a homeless popular spot for 15-30 minutes alone and defenseless until my ride for home came. I never wanted to go the party, but I did prefer it over potentially being kidnapped; so until my ride was to show up, I stuck with Keoni and went to the party.  \nWe were some of the first to get there and the host upon seeing me was very hostile. He told me this was a party for seniors only. I had no idea, Keoni had TOLD me I would be fine. Especially because their were plenty of non-seniors he was very welcoming to.  \nExcept I'm just generally not popular at all; im autistic, queer, and one of the only non-white people in a very priveldged area and this was fs a popular priveldged kid party. I've been school hopping and was bullied a lot at my last school, but so far I'd just been somewhat socially outcasted here. It's a small school so everybody knows everybody. I told the host who we will call Chad that I didn't know, I was sorry, I was getting picked up in just a few minutes, I could wait outside. But Chad was not having it and told me to pay him ten bucks at that moment. I'm unemployed; I don't have any money. He makes the nearest person to me pay for me, with a very degrading tone towards me being broke and me in general. Really making it out like I am such an asshole. All with the attention of the surrounding party. Now I'm shamefully waiting outside in the dark- cus my phone died- to go home.  \nMaybe I'm just overthinking or being period hormonal, but I can't help but feel really dreadful at the harsh exclusive treatment. Nevertheless, maybe he was right and I was just being such an asshole for being a sophomore at a senior party-so, AITA?",

Or he had had a ton of party crashers that evening and was angry. Still, he should have taken it up with Keoni, not you.\n\nIf you'd shown up uninvited to my party and I had to ask you to leave, I guess I would have, but demand compensation? For what, for breathing in my general direction? Wtf. Chad's a major AH.\n\nAlso, Keoni isn't your friend if he assured you it'd be fine but then let you fend for yourself and didn't take your side when Chad acted like an effing clown. In fact, he's even bigger of an AH than Chad.",

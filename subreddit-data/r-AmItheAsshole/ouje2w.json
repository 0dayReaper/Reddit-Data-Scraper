    "postText": "\n\n\nContext: My sister (F27) and I (18F) lost our dad a year ago. He was my only parent, mom was never in mine or my sister's life. Dad left money (inheritance) for me and sister and she used her inhertance to get new cars and renovate her house\nI live with my aunt right now cause my brother inlaw didn't let me stay with my sister. I'm planning on using my inhertance money to pay for college tuition (I've always wanted to be doctor but haven't decided which branch yet).\n\n\nMy sister &amp; I haven't been close, it started after she got married to her chronically ill husband who was allowed to make backhanded comments about dad and mock his llness and make a scene at his funeral.\nonly because he's ill and shouldn't be held accountable for his behavior.\nI've distanced myself But my sister kept visiting alot lately venting about my brother inlaws condition. He's been in &amp; out the hospital for heart problems and in need for a surgery. She brought up my inheritance money several times but I end up cutting the conversation. She then straight up asked if I could help pay for her husband's surgery and she'd pay back in less than a year. I felt uneasy cause if I give her money from my inhertance which is a large amount then there's no gurantee she'll pay back before It's time to apply for college. I'm taking a year gap but I know my sister can't pay back that much and I felt I was risking my future.\n\n\nI refused to help and she had a melt down at my aunt's house calling me heartless, cruel with no empathy. She said that her husband's health should be a priority and I needed to help because education is nothing compared to someone's health and asked if I'd be happy to see her as a widow and my nephew with no father.\nMy aunt suggested others pay but most of them cut my sister and her husband off. I argued that her husband's poor health isn't my fault after she kept blaming and guiltriping me. She kept crying and although my aunt decided to stay out of it she said that I should be prepared for permenant damage in my relationship with my sister if I don't help her now. \n\nShe's been sending texts and pictures of her family telling me this is what I was saying no to, a happy healthy family with a healthy husband and father. I cried and felt like I was being selfish not good aunt and sister. I asked my friend and he said let them sell the cars and all the luxurious stuff they bought to afford the surgery and warned me if I give them money I'll never get it back and may not be able to go to medical school.",

You'll never get the money back because sis isn't willing to give up her luxurious lifestyle.  She chose how to spend her inheritance, didn't save for a rainy day and isn't entitled to yours because of her poor financial planning.  NTA.",

They're trying to live outside of their means as a family which means if you give any money, be prepared to not get it back. Don't be surprised if you keep getting asked for more until you're left with nothing. Your can have this relationship with your sister or you can pay for medical school. You can't have both, but your sister and her husband seem toxic so distancing from them should be your first step.\n\nEdit because forgot to add: NTA",

I think sis torpedoed the idea of family when she left her 17 y/o sister scrambling for a home. OP wasn't family then.",

His life is not your responsibility - just like he did not take on the responsibility of you after you became an orphan. Please don\u2019t give them anything, your sister is trying to manipulate you by publicly shaming you on social media - they both sound like narcissists. Although you are 18 and considered an adult, your brain is not fully developed till you are 25 so you are vulnerable and shame on them for manipulating you. You are better off without them in your life. Keep your aunt as family since she is the one who took you in, you don\u2019t need someone who doesn\u2019t care about your well-being.",

In 1999. (It was a small term life insurance policy to cover final expenses + a couple months of bills, it wasn't some huge  payout to begin with!)\n\nGuess who just sent me a friend request on Facebook and a message asking for money? 22 years no contact, I wasn't even in middle school the last time she saw me, but somehow I came up on their radar again. Leeches never, ever go away completely (but at least it's easy enough for me to just ignore her).",

I had an amputation six weeks ago.  It was a choice between losing part of my foot then and there or probably losing the whole thing in a few weeks.  There was no screwing around deciding how I was going to pay for it.  I knew it would be expensive (surgery plus several days in the hospital, followed by in-home nursing), and even after insurance I know I won't have it paid off this year.  So I figured out what I can give them every month until it's paid off.  What I *didn't* do was try to guilt all my relatives into paying for it because I'd pissed away all my money on frivolities.",

Your sister and BIL will just have to sacrifice their lifestyle and be more responsible with their financial choices. \n\nThey see you as a free-pass that they can take advantage of to get what they need without having to sacrifice.

They can take out a loan using the equity they have in the house as collateral to pay the medical bills.  Since the loan is backed by something physical, the interest rate on it shouldn't be outrageous like if they used a credit card or something similar.  If your sister is so confident that she will be able to pay you back within a year, she should have no problem getting a 5-year loan and paying that off instead.  \n\nIn summary, your friend is absolutely right, if you give her that money, you will never see it again.  And your aunt is also right that there will be permanent damage to the relationship.  However, I would posit a theory that your sister is the one doing the actual damage to the relationship and that the damage is honestly already done.  You already feel like you are a bad person because of your sister's massive guilt tripping.  We only have the small glimpse that you have given us but do you think your sister will actually change if you do give her the money?  She may be thankful for a bit, but how long is it until she needs something else (more time to repay the money, forgiveness of the debt altogether, or more money for another procedure, any of which would hamstring your future career goals and entire life trajectory) and it is back to the drama and guilt tripping again when you try to say no again?  \n\nI can understand your sister's situation and see why she is desperate, but this is definitely a situation where if you give an inch she will take a mile.\n\nAlso,may not be relevant, but what would your dad say if he were alive?  Would he want you to use his money to help someone who mocked him and showed no remorse for it, or would he want you to use that money to go to med school and make an entire living out of helping people?  My bet would be on the latter option that gives you the best chance of personal happiness.",

They are avoiding the multitude of options they do have available to them, because they know those options leave them more accountable than you would. They're scamming you.",

Being ill does not give you a pass to act however you want and disrespect others.\n\nOP should not sacrifice her future for anyone because relationships can always fall apart but an education can help her to achieve her goals. \n\nNTA, OP. Do not give them a penny. Your sister is trying to make you feel bad to manipulate you into doing what she wants but this is not your problem and you do not owe these people your time or money.

Knowing this, they have made poor choices - everything from being generally unlikeable and rude to your father during his life  to not supporting you by letting you live with them after your father passed away to spending their inheritance money on renos and cars (with the reasonable expectation that they would eventually experience a health crisis). \n\nI would also point out that they have conveyed that they will not be there for you in your time of need (living situation). \n\nAll this to say that ou need to look after yourself first\u2026 guilt-free. \n\nYour aunt is right, this will permanently damage your relationship with your sister. My suspicion though is that your sister will always be reaching out to you for money, even more once you become a doctor, so establishing boundaries now will serve you well.\n\nEdit to add: it is really shitty of your sister to put this big, huge burden on your shoulders. You are only 18 years old and have recently lost your father and now need to make important decisions about your own future. This makes me more angry the more I think about it. How dare she put you in this position.",

And yet your sister, living in a situation where emergencies should be expected (either medical or financial, since chronic illness threatens employability), spent her inheritance on luxuries, new cars and a house reno. Your friend is right.\n\nWhy should her husband\u2019s emergency be so important to you when it wasn\u2019t to her?\n\nThe \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back within the year\u201d claim is clearly BS. She doesn\u2019t have just a short-term cashflow problem, and there are other ways of securing loans for such circumstances, from official lenders. Maybe she\u2019s thinking the surgery will magically make her husband so much better that he\u2019ll easily and quickly earn the money back, but if so she\u2019s dreaming. Such quick and miraculous fixes are extremely rare. And your BIL didn\u2019t care that you were an orphaned minor in need of a place to live, so he\u2019s not going to care about paying you back.\n\nSo you won\u2019t get your money back before college, if ever. Which means you\u2019re going to fall out with your sister anyway, eventually, one way or another. That\u2019s not your fault; she\u2019s the one who tied your relationship with her to your money.

I can understand your sister being upset and wanting her husband to be healthy, but that\u2019s not a burden you put on your little sister.

She can take out a loan, since she can apparently pay the entire sum of the money back within a year.\n\nPlus she seems to be a generally nasty person, if EVERYONE has cut her off.

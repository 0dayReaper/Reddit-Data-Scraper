    "postText": "My uncle and aunt, who are more or less the same age as me (30s) visited and stayed over for a few days.\n\nI knew in advance having them over would be challenging because I've had holidays with them in the past, and as my uncle has a \"know-it-all\" personality, he's quite confrontational, needs to have the last word all the time and gives loads of unsolicited advice. I was willing to tolerate everything because I just wanted them to have a really good time at my city.\n\nHowever, it ended up being even worse than I had imagined. Today my uncle and my aunt flew back home and I feel absolutely overwhelmed, stressed, emotionally drained.\n\nOne of the civilised arguments we had during this small trip was that \"I barely talked to him or my aunt the whole time\". I was confused when he told me this, and I told him \"I don't understand why you say that, because for the past few days I have been going around the city with you guys we have been talking a lot\".\n\nHe proceeded to explain that when we got home at night, he was expecting I'd be having conversations with them but we all ended up on our phones before going to bed. I told him I didn't see anything wrong with that, considering we had spent the whole day walking and chatting and we were tired and in my head we were all just relaxing and having some quiet time. I apologised if he felt this was rude of me but emphasised that for me it seemed normal.\n\nHe then proceeded to tell me that I need to talk more in general. I told him I've always been like this, I'm an intro/extroverted, depending on the occasions, but I generally don't just talk if I don't have anything to say. I told him I'm more of a listener, I like to listen and answer accordingly.\n\nHe says I need to mould my personality and be more talkative. I told him I can't do that, because it's the way I am. He says I am hurting myself by being like this, and I explained to him that it feels that way to him because he is very talkative so he can't conceive being any other way.\n\nI told him certain personality traits can be worked on - such as, being too impulsive and learning to think before talking - but other personality traits are so deep, they follow us all our lives - such as being introverted/extroverted.\n\nI also asked him at some point in the conversation, why should I change a trait of my personality that is not harming me or anyone else, just because he would like me to change it?\n\nHe said I was being defensive, and I told him that it's because he is constantly making comments on my personality and it was starting to wear me out.\n\nI know I could be more sociable, go out more, find a boyfriend. But the truth is, I am professionally successful, I have friends, I am independent and live on my own, and feel that I am actually doing quite well. I feel quite happy.\n\nI have things to work on, absolutely, but I don't think me being a bit shy should be considered a negative trait at all, specially when it actually doesn't keep me from working/socialising with friends. It's just who I am.\n\nAITA??",

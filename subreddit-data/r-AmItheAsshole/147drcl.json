    "postText": "Some background info: I am a 16 year old female and I am very much into music, specifically rap, hip-hop, reggae, etc. One of my favorite hip-hop duos is coming near my hometown to perform around my birthday in September this year. I looked into the concert, how much tickets were, where it was located, etc. When I got the general info I brought it up to my parents as how that would be the only thing I'd want for my 17th birthday. I even told them I'd buy my ticket (they are about $100 per person which seems reasonable to me) and I just needed them or an adult to go with me. My mom told me she'd go only if my dad said no, and he said yes. But then my mom brought up we had a camping trip planned that weekend and they couldn't take and I'd have to try and find someone else to bring me. And when I did find someone older I know who agreed to take me, here's the catch, she said I'd have to buy her ticket. But to me I'm in desperate need of an adult for the concert because I really want to go and it's the only thing in the world I want right now. She also likes the duo and shes a cool person to be around overall, so going to a concert with her would be awesome. She's also my last resort when it came down to adults. I told them about her and how if I bought her ticket she'd take me and they said no. I understand why they said no because it is silly for me to buy someone elses ticket for them to take me, but they don't understand how badly I want to go to this concert. I am frustrated. I am out of adults to ask and the only thing I want in the world for my birthday is just to go to this concert. But I also feel like I'm being a brat by only wanting to go to the concert for my birthday. I understand my parents want to take me but my friend is my last resort and I wish they'd let me. I am frustrated and out of options. So here I am. So, any and all feedback is helpful and appreciated, AITA?",

You, or your parents?\n\nIf it's your parents, then it's reasonable for them not to want to pay.\n\nBut if you are paying for it all, then I am struggling to see exactly what their objection is. The money isn't coming out of their pocket. \"Silly\" or not, it's your choice how you spend your own money.",

It's a means to an end and you get to see the show and all is well lol.\n\nbut also, is the rap duo suicideboys by chance? \ud83d\udc40",

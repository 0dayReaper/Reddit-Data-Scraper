Your mom may be going through some difficult things, but that doesn\u2019t make it ok for her to call you selfish and claim that you only nag her. I\u2019m upset at her on your behalf. How is your relationship with other relatives/family friends?",

In the immediate short term, maybe focus on giving your mom an experience/emotional type gift rather than a random physical object. \n\nAt some point, I hope you feel comfortable sharing how you moms comments make you feel to your grandparents/other trusted adult. They may have ideas or strategies to create a more supportive environment for you both. You are not responsible for your mothers feelings but it\u2019s ok to empathize and want to help her.",

A nice gesture to feel appreciated might be what she wants instead of a gift that she may already know about. I\u2019m gonna say NTA but she just sounds stressed, do something nice to make her feel special.",

    "postText": "I've been married to my wife Beth for 5 years. I have a bio daughter named Jessica (she's 18). And I also have two stepdaughters named Monica and Leah. They're 25 &amp; 28. Both are single moms and live with us currently.\n\nthere's been issues about my stepdaughters asking my daughter to babysit the kids. Jessica didn't have a problem with it at first since this is what she does to earn money but since her stepsisters don't pay her much, she'd just refuse to babysit. We worked this out by having my wife take care of paying for the babysitting.\n\n\nI planned a family vacation for 3 days and everyone wanted to go. However, Both Monica &amp; Leah suggested that Jessica stay home and watch the kids since Beth doesn't want her grandkids to come. They said it's because the kids are used to Jessica and hiring another babysitter would cause issues. And also said that Jessica isn't too \"fond\" of our destination but it was obvious that Jessica wanted to go. They insisted and Beth offered to pay her double and there was just..a lot of back and forth on this til I demanded they stop bringing it up.\n\nWe were supposed to go last week but when everybody had bagged their bags and was time to go, Jessica found out that she didn't have her passport on her. We searched her bag then went home and searched there. Beth and my stepdaughters kept insisting that we go back to the airport or else we'd miss our flight. They insisted that Jessica stay at home with the kids. They even told the new babysitter to go home cause she was no longer needed. I refused to go and kept searching for the passport til Monica admitted that she helped Leah hide Jessica's passport to get her to stay home with the kids. I was livid I tried to get her to tell me where it was but she said Leah had it, Leah denied so I threatened to cancel the vacation that's when they gave it back. I decided to actually cancel the vacation and blew up at both of them and berated them. They stayed upstairs for a while and Beth refused to speak to me and said that I punished my stepdaughters for worrying about their kids and wanting them to stay with someone they know. I got told I overreacted and ruined the trip for everybody.\n\nEditing to mention that kicking my stepdaughters out isn't possible since my wife co-owns the house that we currently live in.",

The stepdaughter and wife are trying to treat OP's daughter like a modern-day Cinderella.  I'm not saying g that he should divorce his wife, but he should seriously reconsider if his marriage, in it's current iteration, is a healthy situation to be in.",

I think it\u2019s disgusting when parents prioritize their new spouse over their existing child, especially when that new spouse has shown their parenting role model is the evil stepmother from Cinderella. \n\nOP is wrong to be with this woman, and to let her and her daughters be around his daughter at all - I *highly* doubt this is the first time they\u2019ve all openly treated his daughter like shit - and if he\u2019s a good father, this kind of behavior should be a dealbreaker.",

The house will sort itself out in a divorce, and everyone will likely be moving out.  This whole post talks about how Jessica is being taken advantage of, but OP fails to see that wife/stepdaughters are massively taking advantage of OP as well.  Two women in their mid-20s who seem to feel entitled to do nothing more than make babies is not going to just end with the two small children that are currently in the picture.  OP's going to be supporting them, and supporting them, and supporting them some more until there's nothing left.  The line should have been drawn long ago.  Pursuing a divorce is probably the only way to get OPs wife to see that she's not the only one who gets a vote on whether or not two baby-making moochers live under the same roof and get to treat other family members badly.\n\nAlso, isn't stealing someone's passport a federal crime?  And withholding someone's passport in order to press them into domestic servitude?  Baby Mamas need to do some growing up.  NTA  (ETA: I'm not saying a federal tactical team should be sent in.  I'm just saying OP has a LOT of leverage to get the house cleared out)",

But I'm not sure if this would meet the criteria of a \"stolen\" passport, at least to the federal government. Morally absolutely they stole it and are completely gigantic AHs (Beth, and the 2 step daughters). i hate this for the OPs bio daughter, because this whole situation is totally fucked, and I feel bad for the husband that he's just now seeing their true colors... Though I'm sure there have been other signs before this that have dismissed. So really OPs daughter is the only true innocent \"victim\" in this circumstance. Fuck OPs new(-ish) wife/Stepmom and step sisters/daughters.  Those 3 are absolutely friggin awful - that absolutely is as nice as I can manage to muster in this particular situation.

Honestly, if this happened to me and my father didn't take extreme action like, I don't know, divorcing the wife and/or kicking the stepdaughters out permanently and ensuring the are NEVER around when I was visiting I'd most likely be \"divorcing\" my father. \n\nThat's some seriously fucked up way to treat anyone and to stand by and essentially allow them to treat your daughter like this is mind blowing. \n\nOP possibly has a decision to make between his wife and his daughter, I know where my loyalty would lie.",

If they were willing to pull this vacation bullshit (which your wife was clearly in on) I would bet Jessica is treated far worse than you think. No joke, this feels like a modern Cinderella story. \n\nYour daughter deserves better than this and your loyalty should lie with her rather than your wife and stepdaughters. As someone who is dealing with something similar, this is the kind of thing where your daughter will end up cutting all contact with you. It's your job to protect her and have her back and you are failing miserably at it by letting your wife and stepdaughters treat her like this. \n\nThere needs to be immediate consequences for this behavior and some strong boundary setting followed by actually enforcing those boundaries. Some possibilities:\n\nEveryone needs to apologize to Jessica.\n\nJessica will no longer be available to babysit (unless she freely decides to with no coercion or bullying or guilt tripping or manipulating from anyone) so stepdaughters will need to find alternative childcare just like every other single mom has to do. If it's such a big deal your wife can babysit her own goddamn grandkids for the pennies your stepdaughters are willing to offer.\n\nJessica needs a *keyed* lock on her bedroom door if there isn't one already so she has somewhere safe to retreat to. You can keep a spare for emergencies *as long as you tell absolutely no one else where it is besides Jessica*. The point is to keep everyone else out of her space in case of retaliation.\n\nJessica is only responsible for herself and her own needs. No cleaning up after other people, no taking care of kids, nothing except letting her live her life as independently as possible given the situation. She's an adult and deserves to be treated like one.\n\nAt a minimum, wife needs to agree to marriage counseling. There needs to be a plan in place with concrete steps and timelines. If she doesn't meet them, divorce. If she refuses counseling or apologizing for her abhorrent behavior, divorce. If she continues to enable her daughters and treat Jessica poorly, divorce. And then you need to follow through on this. \n\nQuietly look into what it would take for you to either move out or buy out your wife regarding the house. Is her name on the actual deed or just the mortgage? Mortgage =/= deed.\n\nConsult a divorce lawyer to find out what your options are even if you don't end up going down that road. A lot of them will do free consultations. It's better to be prepared than to scramble to find someone should you need it. \n\nUpdate the beneficiaries on any accounts. If it were me, Jessica would be the sole beneficiary unless you are 100% committed to continuing the marriage (fully knowing your wife and stepdaughters aren't going to change). Updating your will (or writing one if you don't have one) would also be a good idea. Do these things quietly so no one flips shit. If things end up working out with the wife you can always change them back. \n\nRight now your greatest concern needs to be your own child. Not your wife, not your stepdaughters. *Your own child*. Wife and stepdaughters have made it very clear through their actions that they do not accept Jessica as family, do not respect her, and do not think she deserves to be treated like a human being.\n\n*When someone shows you who they are, listen THE FIRST TIME*. They are not going to change. This is who they are. It's your job as a parent to look out for your own children and prioritize them over a new wife and stepdaughters who only care about themselves.\n\nJessica is watching your every move, I guarantee it. How you handle this situation will likely determine the relationship you have with her going forward. Are your terrible wife and stepdaughters worth more to you than your own daughter? If she means anything to you at all, if you value your relationship with her at all, *you will do what's necessary to rectify this situation to HER SATISFACTION and protect her going forward*, even if that means divorcing your wife.\n\nAlso, why tf would you stay married to such a mean, cruel person? Grow a backbone and protect your daughter. Your wife and stepdaughters are grown ass adults who can take care of themselves. Your daughter is still a fucking teenager and could really use someone looking out for her. *If you love your daughter, you will be that person for her.*",

Besides the fact that she is being disrespected and taken advantage of, she is seeing an example that it's ok for an adult to be stunted and mooch off all of their relatives forever. Your wife's daughters are losers. They have kids of their own, and they can't manage to live independently? I was a very young single mother myself-I had my own apartment. I can't imagine cramming my kids into my moms house with moms stepkid AND my sister and her kids too. That would be an emergency/we're going to be homeless/ this is extremely temporary situation, not a way of life. But your steps were going on a family vacation with you ffs-so obviously there's no financial emergency, or you and wife would be skipping a vacation and paying for a rental deposit for them to move out instead.\n\nPlease support Jessica into moving out on her own ASAP if you decide to stay with wife. You should support Jessica being an adult ASAP anyways, because living like your stepdaughters do is not emotionally healthy. Save money to help her with rental deposits/moving/maybe a couple of hundred a month towards her share of rent with a roommate soon. The goal should be out of the house by 21-it's worth helping financially to make that happen vs. letting grown up kids live with you then spending money taking them on vacations.",

I do understand that you also put money and time into his account, but at the end of the day that was your choice and still his account. If he agreed to let you have the account then it\u2019s ok but since he blocked you I think you should keep it as is unless eventually he says something. I would avoid putting anymore money into this account since if he does decide to play games again and finds that you took his account he can contact Sony saying his account was hacked.",

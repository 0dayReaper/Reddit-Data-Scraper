    "postText": "Pretty much the entire question is in the title but here's some expansion. \n\nI am actually only 29 and I kind of felt like my sister (niece's mom) did some pretty good salesman ship to all of the siblings (there are 8 of us) to each gift my niece $1000 when she graduated high school. I can come up with the money but it also means that I wasn't able to book a vacation that I've been wanting to take a long time. I was ok with that because the implication was that money would be used for tuition of living expenses.\n\nI finally saw my niece yesterday with the full intention of giving her the check. I asked her if she was excited to start college in the fall and she said she wasn't going...ok that's a surprise so I asked her what she planned on doing she literally said \"oh nothing\" and I said \"oh you mean nothing like get a job?\" and she said \"no literally nothing.\"  \n\nI think she tried to jump past the awkwardness by asking her if I wanted to see the design her boyfriend made for her tattoo. It was  elaborate to say the least...it was tacky AF to say the most. It looked exactly like a tattoo a 21 year old dating an 18 year old would design to \"mark his territory.\" She then blurted out that my $1000 was all that she was waiting on before she could get started. \n\nI did not mention that i had the check and I did not give it to her. After I left I called my sister and I asked her if she knew what Vera's plans were. She said yes. I told her that I was really sorry but I am not contributing. She accused me of breaking a promise. I accused her of not being honest with us. She said I was a b----, I said to call me back if Vera decides to be productive then I'll come through with the gift. I think we said \"f you\" and simultaneously hung up on each other.\n\nAITA?",

I\u2019ve got a lot and even I wouldn\u2019t dare go near my feet. \nI scoffed at the price but if it\u2019s that large I\u2019m not surprised. She really needs to try getting some ink done before even considering a large one like that as she will most likely not be able to handle it with no experience. It would be really rough experience.\nEnd of the day it\u2019s your money so if you don\u2019t feel comfortable with it being used for that it\u2019s down to you. I\u2019d just put what you can aside for her for when she matures a bit. Can get a car or good bit towards a mortgage with 8k..",

NTA but like... the money in general... the whole amount... the... everything? \n\nWhen I got my GED, I got balloons and cards (I was embarrassed because I thought I didn't deserve it and was already in community college at that point because of a deal I made and CLEPing out and complicated). When I graduated with my BA, I got two cards and $250 total and only one parent came (total--no one else was there). When I got my MFA, I got $750 but some of that was because my now-spouse was flying from across the world to see me graduate and I hadn't seen him in a year and it was VERY generous of them and they knew we wanted to drive up to Canada. \n\nBut $1000 per person... for a high school graduate? .... totaling $8000? For an $8500 tattoo?   \n$8400 was the amount of my/our (total) wedding gifts (we were EXPLICITLY clear that people did not need to do gifts at all, that their presence was most important, and although we had a registry since some people wanted that said if people felt inclined, cash would help us as we were living with one of my parents and we wanted our own place instead of an 11'x9' room) and we were SHOCKED that it was that much (a huge portion of that was because of immigration fees from some very generous folk and we were super grateful). We wanted to save money so we literally had our wedding in a BAR (great times!) and because of the community, the pastor refused to take a cent but said he'd love dinner for him and his wife and I bought him a book on like I think 400 different ways to open beer and wine bottles with random objects (he LOVED it). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut $1000... per person... for... high school graduation...? That... is that normal??? That seems like the most generous gift to ANYONE so it'd allow the student to focus on their STUDIES in school without trying to juggle working, ensure they have time to work on their schoolwork, and if responsible, have some on the other end to come out. Or to pay off a decent amount of tuition. Or... I don't get it. I literally don't get it.",

I can come up with the money but it also means that I wasn't able to book a vacation that I've been wanting to take a long time. I was ok with that because the implication was that money would be used for tuition of living expenses.\n\nI finally saw my niece yesterday with the full intention of giving her the check. I asked her if she was excited to start college in the fall and she said she wasn't going...ok that's a surprise so I asked her what she planned on doing she literally said \"oh nothing\" and I said \"oh you mean nothing like get a job?\" and she said \"no literally nothing.\"  \n\nI think she tried to jump past the awkwardness by asking her if I wanted to see the design her boyfriend made for her tattoo. It was  elaborate to say the least...it was tacky AF to say the most. It looked exactly like a tattoo a 21 year old dating an 18 year old would design to \"mark his territory.\" She then blurted out that my $1000 was all that she was waiting on before she could get started. \n\nI did not mention that i had the check and I did not give it to her. After I left I called my sister and I asked her if she knew what Vera's plans were. She said yes. I told her that I was really sorry but I am not contributing. She accused me of breaking a promise. I accused her of not being honest with us. She said I was a b----, I said to call me back if Vera decides to be productive then I'll come through with the gift. I think we said \"f you\" and simultaneously hung up on each other.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The only way that can only be interpreted is she is starting something in the fall, ie. school or possibly moving out on her own, which is costly. The sister out and out lied to her siblings to get them to, unknowingly, pay the cost of the tattoo.",

The mother deliberately mislead her siblings indicating their large monetary gifts would be a great help in the fall. Meaning for school - as noted in OP\u2019s comment history. That\u2019s the reason for them each giving their niece $1000. It\u2019s extremely doubtful they would have given such a large sum if they knew it was to pay for a tattoo.",

Keep in mind your interpretation or view of what is implied of something could literally be no one else\u2019s.\nThat being said you niece is being an idiot. That tattoo idea is stupid and creepy. And she should not have cursed at you.\nEdit: I forgot to mention you definitely suck less that her. Just be more upfront about intentions in the future.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong I think the niece is a brat but I don\u2019t see that she previously promised she was using it for any specific purposes. \nI see that OP said that is was implied to be used for college but that unfortunately means nothing. Maybe I am misreading something though so if not please explain. \nThat being said can\u2019t ever just assume other people are same page as you. That\u2019s just not good mature communication. You always need to clear state out what your belief around the intention of something is. \nAgain between the two of them the niece is definitely most at fault. That being said to quote Brene Brown \u201cClear is kind. Unclear is unkind.\u201d. It\u2019s an easy mistake to make, especially when you are young. BUT if she eliminates this kind of assumption in the future it will help out so much in life.",

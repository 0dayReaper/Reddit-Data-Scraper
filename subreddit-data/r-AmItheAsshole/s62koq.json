    "postText": "\n\n\nMy F35 sister F27 started dating one of those \"brutally honest\" guys few months ago. He can be quite rude and make backhanded comments about me and the family sometimes which is bothersome but my sister says he's not malicious but is just the brutally honest time and we should get used to it.\n\n\nI visited my parents house to celebrate my sister's birthday and my husband couldn't come with me because he was busy, after the party we all sat down for dinner and my sister's boyfriend said it was weird that my husband and I don't have kids despite being married for 6 years now, I was shocked that he brought this up but I gave a short answer stating that it's because of infertility issues, he asked on which side and I didn't wanna answer but my sister said it's on my side. I got uncomfortable as he looked at me for a second and said that maybe not having kids now is a good thing because he thought women over 30 might \"produce\" defective babies due to age.\n\n\nI told him it was none of his business but he said that he was just giving his \"honest opinion\" and that's all. I, in return, told him while maintaining eye contact: \"trust me, if I wanted an asshole's opinion, I would've farted!\". Literally everyone at the table bursted into laughter and my sister and her boyfriend were stunned. Few seconds later her boyfriend excused himself out and my sister followed then sent me a text after they left saying I was mean and disrespectful towards her boyfriend and insulted him maliciously just cause he stated his honest opinion, she also said I ruined her birthday by being petty and making her boyfriend the joke of the night infront of the family. I didn't respond but she demanded an apology via mail as soon as possible, mom agreed that I shouldn't have said what I said and should've just ignored him knowing how he is.\n\nI think AITA but I'm not sure.",

It's used *exclusively* to excuse and defend shitty behaviors and actions as if some people really think that the person has no self-control whatsoever or responsibility for their own actions, but somehow everybody else around them is supposed to have both.\n\nMost people who do this have some sort of agenda, but I can't for the life of me understand those who don't necessarily have bad intentions and still spout this nonsense without even thinking. \"Peace-keepers\" can also be incredibly toxic and sometimes abusive as despite their \"good intentions\" they always put pressure on the wronged party, never on the aggressors themselves.\n\nEdit:\n\n&gt;If everyone called those kind of people on their bullshit instead of tolerating it, either they would realize they\u2019re inappropriate aholes, or they would at least be on notice that people disagree with them.\n\nThis is another very good point. A lot of people double down or just keep acting this way *exactly* because so many people let them get away with it and even protect them from consequences, reinforcing the idea that there's nothing wrong with them and the way they act, it's just that some people \"are being too sensitive\" etc.",

Sure the sperm are fresh but the factory isn\u2019t. They\u2019ve only just started researching how sperm and the age of the father affects babies (ADHD, autism, birth defects, high risk pregnancy, breach birth, etc. dangerous for both mother and baby.) Why are we just now researching this. 35-40 for both sexes is where the \u201cdecline begins\u201d but we only talk about eggs. But by no means is 30 too old to have a baby. \n\nShit if you can have a baby any time before menopause, do it. Just stop shaming women for their age and their reproductive system.

You thought it was your job to share MY private medical information with your boyfriend, in front of me? What the fuck? In what world is that EVER OK? You were so far out of line! \n\nBut then he goes on say that it\u2019s a good thing I can\u2019t have kids because women over 30 might produce defective babies? Are you fucking kidding me? This is the behavior you you want to defend? I should apologize to that asshole? Oh fuck no, never!

I had classmates in college that like to \"just be honest\", and I thoroughly enjoyed \"being honest\" back to them when they went too far out of bounds. \n\nYour sister's boyfriend's reaction reminds me of this post: [Don't rock the boat](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/). In his little fantasy world he gets to play the \"brutally honest person\" because no one ever says anything, and if they do speak up for themselves/other people then he gets all butt hurt. And when someone does finally speak up, he gets super defensive and lashes out because THEY are being rude, while he was \"just being honest\". (Which is a coward move to make)\n\nYour sister is enabling his abusive behavior by \"not rocking the boat\", and dismissing his AH tendencies by saying \"that's just how it is\". The reason I say this behavior is abusive is because he WILL say to your sister one day \"I think you would look better if you did/didn't &lt;do something&gt;\", and then start to whittle down her self confidence over time by just being honest.",

He needs to learn that behavior has consequences, that there are repercussions for speaking rudely.\n\nSister is TA here as well for demanding an apology from you.

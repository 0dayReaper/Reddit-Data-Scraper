If there's going to be a final result, and that final result is based on votes, then telling people to stop voting against the result they don't want to see runs contrary to one of the mechanisms of the sub, and is at least a mixed message. Voting either should serve the conversation (as per most of Reddit) or the result (as per the final verdict idea), but it can't really do both at the same time.\n\n(I'm only talking about comment voting, not post voting.

Instead of actually trying to remedy the greater problems at hand and fix our relationship, can you guys just validate me real quick. Like I'm not a dick, right? She threw away my poster and if I actually cared about the relationship I'd try to understand what is going wrong but I just wanna make sure we're all in agreement she fucked up and has to fix it. Also btw if you say I'm the asshole it's gonna get downvoted into negatives anyway so just tell me how fucked up what she did was, ok thanks.

These posts require no judgment, no debate.  There's just no way to objectively find fault with the OP.   Often people earnestly post them because they are so close to the situation, they're actually confused.   (i.e. \"My husband cheated on me, is verbally and physically abusive, stole $14,000 from my parent's home and disappeared 3 years ago...am I the asshole for wanting a divorce??\")    In these cases, we left a few people tell the OP they're not the asshole and quietly remove it from the sub's front page, so more interesting discussions can flourish.

People just choose to ignore that and downvote something they don\u2019t agree with, but if you actually read the sidebars they all tell you downvoting isn\u2019t meant to be used if you disagree with something.",

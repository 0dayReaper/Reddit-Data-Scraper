    "postText": "I [F30] was invited to a bridal shower. I checked my work schedule and I worked that day so I said, sorry, can't go. I'll send a gift. \n\n10 minutes after I send my RSVP I get a call from my MIL \"why can't you come?\"\n\nMe: I have to work\nHer: can't you get the day off\nMe: no, I actually just took thus day from someone else so I could have your son's birthday off. \nHer: well what time are you done\n*this where I need to add, I have a rule that I don't do family things on days I have to work. It's too exhausting and I want the time to myself. Everyone in my family knows this and generally respects it.*\nMe: technically 1:30\nHer: well it starts at 1 and will only take you 30 min to get here! \nMe: yeah but...\nHer: great! I'll change the RSVP! \nMe: except that...\n*click*\n... I guess I'm going now...\n\nI've been thinking over and over. I don't want to go, I don't want to leave after work to go, and I have my parents dogs that I'm watching as well as a partner I haven't seen in days because hes working nights. No one ever enjoys a bridal shower and no one ever wants to go. I said no and had a good reason yet somehow I feel forced to go.\n\nWIBTA for pretending a kid at my work didn't get picked up on time or a teacher held me back etc. So I can get out of going?\n\nEdit to add: the shower is today. I've been trying to figure out what the hell to do. Some people say \"make a 20 minute appearance until Partner gets up\" just so everyone is happy but the more I think about it and as I go through my work day, I get more and more set on not going\n\n2nd edit: I have also told the bride that even though I'm going, I can't stay long. While I totally get that the party is planned, I can't imagine they're planning on me for that much... maybe I'm na\u00efve?",

Your reasons are your own, and you do not need to justify why you declined the invitation. \n\nAnd importantly, just because someone asks you a question does not mean you need to answer it. \n\nWhen your MIL asked when you get off work, you do not need to tell her. Deflect if you do not want to tell her your work schedule is none of her business. \n\n\u201cI appreciate the invitation, but I will not be attending the shower.\u201d I can\u2019t stand it when people will not accept a \u2018no\u2019 in response to an invitation.\n\nWe all have limits to what we can deal with emotionally- I hate doing things on work days too (aside from things with my immediate family only - meaning my spouse/kids only, not parents). People are utterly exhausting and if I try to do something social when I\u2019m running on empty it takes me days to weeks to recover. Definitely not worth it for an event that holds no appeal.",

I checked my work schedule and I worked that day so I said, sorry, can't go. I'll send a gift. \n\n10 minutes after I send my RSVP I get a call from my MIL \"why can't you come?\"\n\nMe: I have to work\nHer: can't you get the day off\nMe: no, I actually just took thus day from someone else so I could have your son's birthday off. \nHer: well what time are you done\n*this where I need to add, I have a rule that I don't do family things on days I have to work. It's too exhausting and I want the time to myself. Everyone in my family knows this and generally respects it.*\nMe: technically 1:30\nHer: well it starts at 1 and will only take you 30 min to get here! \nMe: yeah but...\nHer: great! I'll change the RSVP! \nMe: except that...\n*click*\n... I guess I'm going now...\n\nI've been thinking over and over. I don't want to go, I don't want to leave after work to go, and I have my parents dogs that I'm watching as well as a partner I haven't seen in days because hes working nights. No one ever enjoys a bridal shower and no one ever wants to go. I said no and had a good reason yet somehow I feel forced to go.\n\nWIBTA for pretending a kid at my work didn't get picked up on time or a teacher held me back etc. So I can get out of going?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

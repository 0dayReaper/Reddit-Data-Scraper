    "postText": "I\u2019m feeling kinda bad because my younger cousin called me up, asking for a favor. Of course I wanted to help\u2026but the favor was house sitting his gf cat til August while they\u2019re on summer break (they\u2019re in college.) I guess his gf got the pet in school, but then her family told her she can\u2019t bring the cat home. (Like dumb on her part 100%, life lesson number one, think before taking on big responsibilities like getting a pet.) \n\nThing is I live in an apartment, so if the landlord found out I had a pet without it on my lease I could be fined. But also\u2026and it\u2019s more than this, I work overnight and have never actually owned a pet ever. I wouldn\u2019t know really the first thing about keeping a pet. And tbh, I\u2019m not crazy about cats.\n\nI also have a very small studio apartment and some of my things are still in boxes (saving for furniture etc.) I\u2019ve just learned over the years, to not be such a people pleaser, say yes to things without knowing what I\u2019m getting into, cuz I\u2019ve regretted later. So this go around\u2026I just felt more led to say sorry I can\u2019t. I feel bad though, like am I being dramatic? Am I the asshole? It is just a cat\u2026",

If you do not feel prepared to take on a pet, especially a cat, please tell them you cannot do it. \n\nNot only would you possibly get in trouble with your landlord, who would cover the cost of care? Who would buy food? Litter? Treats? Toys? What if it gets sick, who would handle the vet bill? What if it gets really sick and (I hope it wouldn't but....) dies in your care? \n\nThere is a lot to take on when you have a pet, and even more to figure out when it's not your pet, it's someone else's. I get it if you had your own home and space and already had cats, but that isn't the case. \n\nThey should want someone who will give their pet good care, and it sounds like you aren't in a place to do that.",

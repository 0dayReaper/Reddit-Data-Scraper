It's not like you are a stranger - you are his mother. Also, this is not a minor thing, this is your son treating his wife like a servant, not a spouse.",

Their own biases did not allow them to see that, actually, women's work provided the bulk of the food in these societies *and* hunting was more often than not NOT strictly gender-segregated. British colonialism was being carried out simultaneously with many of these early studies, which also instituted, often for the first time, strict patriarchal social structures and imposed gender binaries of behaviour and activity that were not native to foraging societies. In modern anthropology, foraging/hunter-gatherer societies are often referred to as \"egalitarian societies\" precisely because they lacked the patriarchal norms and class divisions of other forms of society.",

If your son and DIL end up in court, your DIL having her MIL on her side can be a powerful influence. Knowing the extent you are willing to fight for your grandkids to be raised in a healthy home can help alleviate some of her concerns.\n\nYou're doing amazing, and we are all rooting for you \u2764",

He isnt some dumb fuck who just \"didnt realize\" his wife was working hard and needed help. He didnt want to do the hard or degrading work required to keep a house and raise children and thought that he was above it, that stay at home wife = house slave and he would be exempt from any work outside of his paid job and maybe a few manly chores like lawn care. He decided that the home would be her work place and as such she was never off duty. OPs DIL had to handle the stress of 3 young kids, a husband who doesnt lift a finger and is terminally selfish, no wonder she isnt doing well. It apparently was too much effort for him to accompany her on a spa day, i cant even imagine how horrible he is as a human and partner. I hope for DILs sake they get a divorce.

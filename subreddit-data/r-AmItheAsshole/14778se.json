He lives in the north of the country, she lives in the south and I live in the middle (They live about 8 hours away and I\u2019m 4).  \n\nWe all met each other in the little city we spend our summer holidays with our families. Me and my bsf (I\u2019ll call her Amy) met 4 years ago and 2 years later we met her actual boyfriend (I\u2019ll call him Ryan).  \nWhen they first got together I was so happy for them, they we\u2019re a great couple and their relationship didn\u2019t influenced at all ours. They managed the distance relationship pretty well, but last year thing got a little bit strange. Everytime I facetimed her she was on the phone with Ryan and told me she would call me back later, but never did. Ryan started going more often to her house and Amy\u2019s brother even told me that he wasn\u2019t even asking anymore for hospitality, most of the times he would just casually show up at the door. We had a party at her house for my birthday and when he knew I was gonna stay at hers he came too. Everytime I asked her to come visit me she told me yes and then told me that Ryan planned something else and that she couldn\u2019t come. But last summer happened the thing that really got me thinking.  \n\nWhen Ryan and Amy first got together Ryan had an huge fight with his bestfriend because he tried to approach Amy in multiple occasions.  Last year Amy and I were already at the holiday city, while Ryan was arriving a couple of days later. One night the group, which includes Ryan ex-bsf (and another around 30 freaking people), wanted to go partying and even thought I\u2019m not a fan I accepted bc Amy specifically asked me to.  \nWe were all ready to go, except for Amy. We waited for her in front of her house and she arrived almost 15 minutes later and crying. We asked her what happened but her phone immediately started buzzing and she panicked even more picking it up.  \nWe all understood that when she told Ryan the plans for the night and show him her dress on FaceTime he told her that she wasn\u2019t ALLOWED to go dressed liked that. She then changed in some jeans and a normal cropped t-shirt but he changed his mind again and told her that she was not ALLOWED to go at all without him. She told him that she was going because all the group was, but he got furious remembering her what happened with his ex-bsf and that she could wait a couple of days for him. He then cut the argument off saying that if she was going they were done. \nShe decided not to go and since I was going just for have some fun with my bestfriend I stayed with her trying to cheer her up all night. She didn\u2019t do something wrong that night and other sings of extreme jealousy from him showed up. I can see her getting progressively more distant from me and I don\u2019t wanna loose such an important person to me. So yes, I hope they break up.",

Goodness I am already not liking him\n\nOP in the meantime be Amy's wall of support and her listening ears while you hope the breakup happens. As much as you do not like Ryan, do not say how much you don't like him in case you might unintentionally drive Amy away further to him. Just remind Amy she is not at fault and she is a great person \n\nIf Amy is not ready to break up yet, just be supportive and be there for her. If the break up does happen you know what to do",

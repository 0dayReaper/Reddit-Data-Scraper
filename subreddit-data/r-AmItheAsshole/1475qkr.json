I was largely raised by my grandmother while she focused all of her energy on my brother, J (30M). I get why she had to be there for him, he has a cocktail of developmental disorders and mental health issues that made him harder to raise than I was, but she tends to exaggerate the extent of her involvement in my life when I was a kid, to the point that I've had to double check with other members of my family to make sure I didn't hallucinate parts of my childhood. (Inb4 people tell me she's gaslighting me. I know. I've done therapy about it.)\n\nAnyway I'm married to an awesome dude, K (41M). We've been together for over a decade and agreed fairly early on that kids weren't in the cards for us for a variety of reasons. My mother... has not gotten the memo.\n\nShe's constantly on about how we would make such pretty babies and pointing out baby clothes and such despite the fact that I keep telling her that it's not gonna happen. I've lost my temper a few times, reminding her that I have physical issues that would make having a child extremely risky, and that I don't enjoy being around children in the first place, and that while any baby K and I produced would inevitably be very cute it would also be riddled with genetic issues from both sides of our chronically ill gene pools. She gets the message for maybe a week, then the cycle inevitably begins again.\n\nSo we're on the phone yesterday, and she starts talking about \"her grandkids\" and asks what we would have named them and I'm over here, an idiot, thinking she's using \"would haves\" and decide to spill that in the ever-so-brief period where K and I considered having kids we had planned to name them after my Grandmother who raised me, his mom, his dad, or my brother.\n\nShe got defensive, asking me why I wouldn't name my fictional offspring after her, and I told her we just preferred the other names. She starts saying I'm ungrateful, disrespectful, and then starts crying about how she knows she was a terrible mother but she tried her best.\n\nI told her she was being ridiculous over a baby that was entirely fictional. I have zero inclination to reproduce. She called me a bitch for getting her hopes up.\n\nMy friend thinks I'm kind of an asshole for engaging my mother in the conversation in the first place, but I'm honestly just so tired of having to police my conversations with this woman. I can't go NC because my brother depends on me, but I can't keep acting like the things she's doing are reasonable anymore either. \n\nAITA?",

Honestly, what does she expect? \n\nIf you find yourself talking about this again, start giving her ridiculous names like \"her name and Beetlejuice middle name\" and tell her \"it's a ridiculous conversation and I don't know why you won't let it go when you know K and I aren't having kids.

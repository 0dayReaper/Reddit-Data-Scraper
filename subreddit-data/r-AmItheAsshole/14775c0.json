I may be the asshole because I made him come to my native country earlier when the vacation is not happening when he could use that time to earn more money.

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nIt all started when I (F23) was planning on going to my native country for eye surgery ($2500CAD). Since my mom (F50) would take care of me post-surgery if we went together, I paid for her $1200CAD one way plane ticket and my $2600CAD round trip plane ticket, and I am also giving my mom living expenses ($1050CAD) while I am in my native country.  \n\n\n  \nHowever, my grandfather suddenly got seriously sick in my native country in mid-May. Since this was an emergency, I called the airline and switched my mom's plane ticket to mid-May instead of the original mid-June like we planned. So my mom went to my native country in mid-May, took care of my grandfather, who would pass away nearly a week later.  \n\n\n  \nUnfortunately, after my grandfather passed away, there was lots of drama at her parent's and sister's place (i.e., my aunt and grandmother), where my mom was staying there for free. Now, my mom says she would return to Canada if it wasn't for me. However, since I would have to be in my native country for 1.5 months for the surgery and post-surgery checkups, we have been planning for a vacation to go to the nearby countries for 3 months.  \n\n\n  \nMy younger brother (university student) is coming to my native country in Mid-July. My mom said it would be better for him to go on that trip with me. However, she wanted me to pay for his vacation, which would cost me an additional $2000-3000 CAD.I told my mom that if my younger brother really wants to go on vacation with me, he should pay for his own trip since he's on summer vacation and he has the time to work. But my mom still thinks that since he is using his time to go on this trip I always wanted to visit, I should pay for everything (which would cost $4000CAD in total for both of us). Plus, she thinks it would be dangerous for me to go alone.  \n\n\n  \nAlthough I currently work full-time, I make mid-60K CAD annually. I am saving most of that money for my college tuition for next year, as my parents have told me they wouldn't be able to support me with any money for my college tuition. My college tuition cost $50,000CAD. In fact, during my undergraduate years, I always gave $500/month to my family for living expenses with my school grants and the money I made from internships.  \n\n\n  \nMy younger brother doesn't give any living expenses to my family. Instead, during his first year of Uni, he got $500/month as an allowance. I never got any of that when I was his age. My younger brother also got airpods ($300CAD) from my parents while I always had to buy everything with my own money ever since I started Uni.  \n\n\n  \nNow, my mom is mad at me and giving me a lot of stress because she thinks all I think about is money. I feel suffocated. She thinks I should be buying her more stuff when I arrive in my native country since she plans to support me post-surgery. However, I'm just trying to save enough money for my college tuition for next year. So AITA for refusing to pay for my younger brother's portion of the trip?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "postText": "One of my (29M)  best friends \u201cCarla\u201d (31f) is getting married soon. It\u2019s only meant to be a small backyard type of wedding but they\u2019ve been planning it for a few months now and originally it was supposed to be on my property. They wanted it because it\u2019s private, has lots of open space for the reception, a nice view and the house could be used for them to get ready and stuff. Of course I said yes, she and her fianc\u00e9 \u201cRick\u201d were very happy. Thing is Carla and I do have a history. We went out on &amp; off in college but decided to stay friends. Then I met my wife, we got married, Carla met Rick and now here they are.\n\nNow my wife knows I went out with Carla back in college and she didn\u2019t care. Carla still went to our wedding and everything. I never knew if Rick was told or not, it\u2019s not my relationship therefore not my business to say anything so I never did. Rick found out recently and not in the best way. Not sure how but from what I heard from friends is that one mutual friend told him (no idea why) we used to date. Not only that but apparently Carla said a couple years ago she was still in love with me when she was already dating Rick. Don\u2019t have actual confirmation if that\u2019s exactly what he was told. All Carla\u2019s told me is that Rick was told about our past and he\u2019s angry at her for never saying anything. \n\nIt became quite a drama and didnt hear from her for over a month until now. She told me they\u2019re going to couples counseling and that the wedding is still on. But Rick requested that I not attend. It sucks but I totally get why he wouldn\u2019t be comfortable. Then I asked the obvious question, where are they going to hold the wedding then? To my surprise she said they still want it at our place. \n\nRick said so to and in my mind I\u2019m going \u201che doesn\u2019t want the guy who dated his fianc\u00e9e  years ago at the wedding, but still wants the wedding at his house.\u201d My wife and I are expected to just...not be at our home that weekend, And I told Carla no. They\u2019re going to have to find some place else since we\u2019re not going to simply leave our home to them for the weekend. Not only for safety reasons but it just doesn\u2019t make sense. Rick doesn\u2019t want me around because he\u2019s not comfortable but is comfortable enough to have their wedding at my house? They really want their wedding here though and because of that I\u2019ve been bugged by not only her but also Rick and some friends who think I\u2019m being a petty asshole for not letting them have the wedding here anymore. Honestly don\u2019t think that I am, it just doesn\u2019t make sense at all to have to leave our own place for a wedding we\u2019re no longer welcome to and leaving our home totally vulnerable. Still, being accused of sabotaging their wedding and Rick believes it\u2019s the least I can do after everything. AITA?",

Like, if Carla and OP hooked up once 10 years ago and never talked about it again, I wouldn't really expect Carla to bring it up. Obviously that wasn't the case. Separately, it's not that weird to have ex's at your wedding, especially if it was a while ago and you're all in the same friend group, which from this post I think is the vibe.\n\nAll of this together - the lie and the extended relationship - is a bad mix. I think Rick's jealousy is so intense *because* Carla didn't tell him, like she was hiding it. I think if she had told him when they first met, \"hey me and OP used to date but that's way in the past, I'm with you\", then Rick would have no reason to not want him at the wedding imo. But she didn't, she hid it, which makes it 10x worse.",

Classic.\n\nJust because you guys were comfortable with having Exes in your weddings, doesn't mean that everybody else is. Not only that but this not an Ex that he knew previously before he agreed to marriage. \n\nThis is a NEW Ex-BF he had no knowledge off, and the fact that he had to learn this from a   3rd party rather than his own fianc\u00e9, is probably making him have second thoughts on marrying this girl. OP had broken up with Carla for over 7 years, and for 2 years WHILE dating Rick, she was still in love with OP.",

There is so much prep work and cleaning up afterward. It was kind of OP to allow it for a friend, but I def don't blame him for saying no once he was uninvited.",

If you ask me then 2 years of dating and then getting married is to early, but it's different from person to person or even country to country. I don't blame her for wanting to call things off. It's only 2 years. Had it been maybe 4-5 years, then I'd say try to work things through because in that time you get to know each other for real. In my personal experience you don't know the other person well enough after about 2 years. You need more time.\n\nI will say that 7 years is by far enough time to deal with, a partner having a friend with benefits, and still being friends. You're not at fault, Rick is neither. She should have been honest about it from the get go. Now she knows that and I hope you talk to her and support her in this no matter what she does. But know this: you and her are friends and friends last longer than a bf/gf.\n\nI bet others have mentioned the \"she wants to break things off now\" is a tell tale sign that she's maybe not that invested and I agree. It only makes me think even more that she actually just needs to call it off",

This has all the earmarks of a disaster in the making if you go along with their demands. NO. Don't do it. In fact, you may want to have your friend read over many of the comments to this post, so she realizes just how unreasonable a demand this is from her fianc\u00e9. IMO if he is reacting this poorly NOW, it is DEFINITELY a bad sign for the coming marriage.\r  \n\r  \nAs for the friend that \"tattled\" it would behoove all involved to find out WHY that friend thought it necessary to spill the beans (especially the bit about her saying she still loved you years ago after she and Rick had started dating) and what that person was hoping to accomplish. If it was an honest mistake, fine.

Omitting that info seems a bit off on Carla's part too. Doubly so with the bit about her still being in love with OP, but even setting that aside it doesn't seem right.\n\nMy partner doesn't know my whole history (though I'd be fine to talk about it if asked) but I made damn sure they knew about any history I had with people they actually meet.

Post-wedding, the bride returns home one last time. When she goes to leave (if this part is actually going to happen) all her sisters, aunts, cousins etc literally block the door &amp; cars from moving. They must be adequately paid to allow the bride to leave, and there can be full on negotiations. Sometimes demands are ridiculous, then the elders will urge them to be more reasonable so the job gets done.",

Your partner not telling you they dated their best friend for two years (and having to find out from some third party) is bound to cause insecurities. The OP also mentions that Carla was apparently telling people she was still in love with him while dating Rick. Rick is probably wondering if Carla really does just see the OP as a friend now. But it's easier to be angry at the friend of his girlfriend than his girlfriend, who he loves, herself.\n\nNow different people have different tolerance levels for their partners being friends with their ex. Some people fall into \"never being friends with exes\" category, some people are cool with being friends with exes but not close/best friends, and some people are cool with whatever. Ideally, you date someone who shares your opinion.",

No, there is absolutely no way they should be having their wedding at your house after that. And if Carla is for it, then that\u2019s not your friend. NTA.\n\nAlso. Rick thinks it\u2019s the least you can do after everything? What? Going out with your friend before you had any idea of his existence? My god. Just rolled my eyes so hard, they got stuck. Brb.",

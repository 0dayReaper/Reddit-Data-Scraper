    "postText": "So, I (28M) just moved into a house together with my girlfriend (32F) and we spent a lot of money fixing and moving in general. Yesterday my uncle invited me to a Tool concert in Boston in November. I said I didn't have enough money to pay for flights, hotel and stuff. He said he could pay for my hotel and lend me the rest of the money and I could pay him the money back in January.\nMy problem is that my girlfriend has never travelled abroad because she had a kid pretty young and she never had enough money or time to travel. I've been planning to take her in a surprise trip, probably next year when my finances are back to normal. But I would have to push that back if I'm going to be travelling in November as well.\nI'm feeling conflicted even though my girlfriend doesn't know about the trip because I feel bad travelling and having fun by myself knowing that she wishes to do that but has not been able to.\nMy uncle already bought tickets and he just bought 2 so I can't invite her over to the show. She doesn't like Tool either. Also, I'm not from USA so going to Boston is a big trip.\n\nWIBTA if I go in this trip alone and push my trip with my girlfriend a couple months back?",

It is understandable that you want to take your girlfriend on a surprise trip, however, it's also honorable that you are taking this opportunity to go on a trip, especially when your uncle is paying for the hotel and offering you the rest of the money to help you cover the expenses. It would be a nice gesture to your girlfriend to explain the situation to her and to give a date of when you will be able to take her on the trip. It's only respectful to be clear and honest with her so that she doesn't get confused or think that you are hiding information from her.",

Your parents are being ridiculous, and your sister is a user.\n\nHow financially difficult would it be for you to leave? I wouldn't want to stay with them if it was me.\n\nEdit: People keep pointing out that OP has paid roughly $38000 in the last 4 years. It isn't that I can't do maths, I was making the point that OP paid $19000 *while the sister has lived there for free over the last two years*.\n\nEdit 2: my first ever silver! Thank you kind stranger! And my first comment thanking a stranger for silver, so many firsts in one day!",

That's why OP's mom thinks it's OP's fault for bringing this issue to light instead of the sister's fault for not paying rent in the first place. They'd rather cater to the sister's temper tantrum and shame the dutiful child because they know it's likely to be more effective and meet with the least resistance.",

I'd suggest you look into the phenomenon of the Golden Child complex (which while some people think they know what it is, it's a rare complex because it requires two people to have it. Parent and child)  \n\n\nThey have this for their daughter. She can do no wrong. She does wrong, she makes excuses. IF the other children won't cover the wrong they do, then the other kids are the reason the golden child did bad thus it's  the other kid's fault.  \n\n\nFriend of mine got blamed for their golden child brother getting drunk and stoned and crashing his car even though that friend is straightedge af, and was paying for the place that he, the brother, and the mother were staying at. Their mom said it was his fault for making the younger stressed out when there was nothing HE was doing that was stressing the brother out, just that he could get away with it because the mother always made it the older brother's fault.  These complexes always come with a scapegoat if multiple kids are involved. OP is the scapegoat.  \n\n\nThey do not see what the daughter is doing is wrong.

            "comment": "I may get get downvoted into oblivion, but hear me out: \n\n1) I think your parents should force your sister to pay rent or throw her out on the street. Period. They are harming and enabling her by allowing this to continue. \n\n2) You\u2019ve done the adult thing by paying rent this entire time. You\u2019ve been a dutiful child, and have earned your keep at the house. Most people who live at home with their parents pay nothing (as you\u2019ve seen firsthand); you\u2019ve stepped up. \n\n3) You should move out on your own if you\u2019re able to afford it. I say this because it\u2019s not only good and healthy for you, but you shouldn\u2019t have to support your sister who refuses to contribute. \n\n4) If your parents are having financial issues and need your rent as part of their income, perhaps work out a 6 month plan that transitions you out of their home. This gives them the runway to find an alternate source to help support themselves, but also gives you a deadline to move out and avoid this drama. \n\n5) You should be angry, upset, feel betrayed, etc. it\u2019s not fair, and it\u2019s wrong that everyone living under the roof who is able to contribute to the family is not. Moving out makes all of that disappear. \n\nHope everything works out.",

It'd be one thing if she hit a rough patch and need some help, but it's pretty clear she just hasn't wanted to act like a responsible adult for the past 2 years and likes being selfish. It's pretty shitty for your parents to make you pay more than your sister. Nothing is fair about that and you have every right to be pissed.\n\nIdk where you live but paying $800 to live with your parents sounds a bit steep. I'd say most places you'd be able to find your own place to rent around that price (studio or 1 bedroom), or at least be able to get a place with a roommate where rent should be split fairly.",

If she is making a small amount of money  to get into a business that may pay better down the road, that is your parent's prerogative, especially only being employed for two years.   If she makes much less, both of you can pay what you can afford, that is your parent's  option.   Now, that they make her pay nothing because she makes a scene, NTA.    Extrapolating, if she has a job, a $450 a month car payment but can't afford insurance, she isn't making a lot of money (of course, if that car is a BMW, or if she has a closet full of designer clothes, I take it back.",

            "comment": "NTA. I'm not sure where you're located, but in many places, $900-1000/month is rent for a decent apartment with no roommates. It sounds like you're getting a bad deal on rent to begin with unless you're in a *very* high cost of living area. I would just move out-- it's the high road thing to do here, and it leaves you out very little more (if anything) than you were before. \n\nIn addition to the you pay/she doesn't unfairness, your parents are essentially asking you to subsidize your sister as well-- because if you are paying extra to help them out, and they are paying for your sister's phone/car/etc., *you* are in effect helping pay for that stuff.",

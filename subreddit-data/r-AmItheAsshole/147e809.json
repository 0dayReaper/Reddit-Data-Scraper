Have in your pocket what you want and what you can live with, but explain that he can not build now and let him come up with alternatives.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nHi team -\n\nI need someone to give it to me straight. \n\nWe are extremely fortunate to live on top of a hill with beautiful views of the mountains. The former owners of my house created view protections which were created when the land was initially divided up for development 30+ years ago. These view easements are legally enforceable and part of our house deed. They are also part of the deeds for the two houses that are in the view corridor for the mountains. They are not allowed to build higher than 30 feet. All homes have changed hands from the original owners.\n\nMy neighbor\u2019s home - which is one of the homes that has a 30 foot height restriction - burned down. He is now rebuilding and has added an entire floor to his new home. New home is well above 30 feet. 34-36 feet or so.\n\nHe was not aware of the height restriction (although it\u2019s part of his deed and he should have reviewed this) and started building. He added an entire additional floor to the new house. As soon as we realized his house would partially block the view and would be in violation of the view easement we had our attorney review the property rights. We are clearly allowed to stop the building.\n\nWhen I reached out to my neighbor to either stop building or reach a financial agreement for compensation - he melted down. Threatening text messages at 4 am, threats to cause trouble at my place of work, and threats to erect offensive structures on his roof have all been made. \n\nHe feels I should just let him build what he wants. He doesn\u2019t think it alters the view - it does - and thinks I\u2019m just out for cash. \n\nHonestly - at this point it\u2019s hard to be objective. I\u2019m now used to nothing being there so anything feels jarring. I\u2019d prefer to just have the views intact but that\u2019s out of the question as the house is being built presently.\n\nIf I don\u2019t enforce the restriction I have been informed that it nullifies the view protections and can basically be interpreted as precedent to ignore it for any future building.\n\nI now have to communicate with an intermediary for him because he couldn\u2019t be civil. \n\nOptions at this point are:\n\nTake a cash payment and have him cover attorney fees - I think he would resent this and already feels like this is a money grab.\n\nMake him remove his third floor and put on a flat roof - the house is nearly completely framed at that point. I think this preserves our view mostly but would ruin the relationship forever. Maybe it\u2019s already ruined\u2026\n\nFind some compromise where he gets his third floor but has a lower roof - he would have to cover attorney fees for this as well as significant time went into researching this and drafting an exception for his house takes time. I don\u2019t like this option because I want to be compensated for my loss of view and making the exception but I also feel like a compromise should mean neither party gets everything they want.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

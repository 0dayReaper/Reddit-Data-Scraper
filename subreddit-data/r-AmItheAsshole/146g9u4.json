    "postText": "For context I'm a 27(F) who lives at my boyfriends(29M) house with his family. His dad, mom, and brother (around the same age as me.) We're all fairly close except for his dad who is a truck driver so he's not home often. Anyway my bf's mom and I have bonded alot through the 5 years we've been together. My mom(63F) recently passed from stomach cancer in Feb 2022 so naturally she took on that motherly role for me. \n\nThrough the entirety of my mother being diagnosed to her dying my father(67M) was an absolute prick about the whole thing. I'm talking it was close to abuse of my mother and me, not physically but mentally and emotionally. He would take her pain pills and leave the house for a few hours at a time claiming he \"forgot\" he had them in his pocket. I sat with my mom in her bedroom while he was in the living room. He would scream and yell at me if I tried to go visit my boyfriend simply because he didnt want to deal with her alone. He would constantly talk about putting her in the hospital and that be that until she dies. Left her in a hospital for about a week and made me go inside while he left to go home. Forced my bf and I to take her to the hospital for a blood transfusion in the middle of a fucking snow storm even though he was more than capable taking her himself.\n\n Now I never minded doing any of this for my mother. I love that woman more than anything. I simply put up with my father for my mother. He was an asshole how he treated her. Always claiming he loved her and was more upset than anyone else. Yeah right. \ud83d\ude44 Fast forward to a year later my dad got diagnosed with kidney cancer and had to have the whole thing removed fortunately that was it. He's ok. But he's been trying to make me come spend time with him and go see him. I don't want to. I'll always love my dad because the little girl in me will always love him. But I kind of hate him. I don't want to go see him but none of my 5 siblings go visit him anyway because they all hate him too. There are times I wish him and my mom would've switched places. Does this make me an asshole for feeling this way. For wishing to never have to see him anymore?",

This action might make me an asshole because he was recently diagnosed with kidney cancer and although he had it removed and he's fine I still don't want to see him. Which kind of makes me feel like an asshole. So far it's mainly a few choice people who don't know what really happened during those months that have called me an asshole. They don't know what my mom went through and they don't know what inwent through mentally and emotionally. I know he's the only parent I have left but the way he acted during my mom's cancer has made me hate him.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You loved your mother so it is natural to occasionally wish \u201cthey could switch places\u201d.  That is normal. \n\nNow that the shoe is on the other foot since your father is ill, he is reaching out for support &amp; comfort. He is feeling weak &amp; alone. Only you can decide if you want to respond. Sorry for the loss of your mother. Your BF\u2019s family sounds like you have a new home-good luck!",

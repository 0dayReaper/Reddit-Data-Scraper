    "postText": "My dad married my step mom when I was 10 and my step brother, Jack, was 8. He\u2019s 18 now and I\u2019m 20. \n \nI don\u2019t like him much. He\u2019s\u2026 for a lack of better words\u2026 extremely trashy. The way he acts, looks, etc. His mom\u2019s clearly embarrassed of him but she won\u2019t say anything to his face. I don\u2019t either tbh, I try to mind my own business. But my dad says whatever is on his mind. \n\nI assume it\u2019s obvious, but I\u2019m not a fan of how he lives his life. It\u2019s extremely different to how I was raised. But I\u2019ll also say that Jack isn\u2019t necessarily a bad person. We just don\u2019t get along due to how different we are. He thinks I\u2019m uptight so it\u2019s not one sided.\n\nNow, my dad had a dinner with some of his coworkers and invited them all to our house. He told Jack he needs to cut his hair. Jack said he\u2019d stay the night at his friend\u2019s house because he wasn\u2019t going to cut his hair. \n\nYou know, of all things, his hair is actually nice. It\u2019s messy but like on purpose so it looks good. It\u2019s not even that long, barely reaches his shoulders. \n\nDad said he had to be there and they got in a fight over it. Jack eventually compromised and said he\u2019d tie it up. \n\nBut the night of the dinner, Jack had his hair down, was wearing shorts and a tank top with some \u201cdemonic\u201d band on it that showed off his \u201cdemonic\u201d tattoos, and omg he even had a snap back on!!! The horror!! I\u2019m being sarcastic but my dad wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t even think his friends cared lol. \n\nHe started yelling at Jack after they left and called him every name you could think of. My dad said something about betrayal which was stupid and then said \u201cthey\u2019re all going to think I raised an idiot\u201d and while I do think Jack is an idiot, I thought my dad was acting stupider so I (stupidly) said \u201che\u2019s a cool idiot though, not boring like you, so I don\u2019t think u have to worry haha\u201d idek why I added the boring bit. So unnecessary now that I think about it.\n\nBut Jack gave me a fist bump and was all like \u201csee even annoying jr doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal, she\u2019s right, you just have a stick up ur ass.\u201d \n\nDad gave me the angriest look you can imagine and kicked BOTH of us out. I probably had that coming but Jack has his dad, idk anyone like that?? Thankfully Jack let me stay with him. But dad never gets mad at me like that and while he let me back in the house, he\u2019s still being really cold. I do feel bad and immature, but was what I said that bad? AITA?",

Dad says attendance is mandatory, tries to pressure Bro to cut his hair for a dinner, and then blows up and kicks you out over calling him \"boring\"?? Sounds like a lot of immaturity on his part. I mean Stepbro literally offered to leave for the night to avoid this. I think Stepbro should have held up his end of the compromise (tying his hair back) but honestly, if Dad was SO embarrassed of him to begin with, why would he want to introduce him to coworkers? Seems like the easier solution was to have Stepbro go to his friend's house for the night.\n\nIf a simple comment like that gets you kicked out, I think it's time to move lol\n\nEDIT: Replaced \"friends\" to \"coworkers\" since I misread the first time",

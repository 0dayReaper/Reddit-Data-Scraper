He usually tells me that he wishes I would get along with SM or asks why don\u2019t I just do my laundry myself. I\u2019ve also tried asking SM if I could do it. Every time, she dodged the question by acting like I was asking when she was going to do the laundry and told me she would do it that night. I tried reminding her every week that I need laundry done but I never got enough laundry back for it to matter.\n\nIt\u2019s summer and all I have is a few sweaters. I bring my laundry out every week, had nothing cleaned for 4. Because I need a shower and clean clothes to change into, I decided to throw in a load of laundry. I didn\u2019t ask SM because she was putting my 1yro brother down for a nap. My older brother said he needed laundry done when I asked, so I put some in for him, too. I did no baby clothes because they have more clothes than everyone in the house combined.\n\nI knew she would be upset and I was scared of how she would react. I smell awful and I think I have a yeast infection from not changing for the past 2 weeks.

Two babies that close together increases her risk for post partum issues, too (because your hormones don't settle down from one pregnancy before having another).   But in any case, you and your brother are adults.  You need to sit down with her and your dad and say 'it's unfair that you do all the laundry, all the cleaning, and caring for the babies.   We're going to start doing our own laundry.  We're also going to get this house cleaned top to bottom, and then we're all going to agree on a chore schedule that will keep the house clean without you having to do everything yourself.  You are one person.  Caring for two babies is a full time job.   We all live here, and we are all going to help get this done.   We won't always do it the way YOU would do it, but we're going to do it and make sure those babies are living in a clean, healthy environment.'  \n\n\nAnd look, I know logically that anyone can get mice, but I seriously hate those little b\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*ds and feel like everything is contaminated with the bubonic plague when we get one.  I legit moved out of my house when I came home after a week at hospital with my first born and a mama mouse had gotten in and had babies.   I refused to go back until they were all gone--the thought of them running across my baby made me physically ill (There were definitely some post partum hormones involved in that decision :P).   Those babies are crawling/toddling around.  You need to do whatever it takes to get rid of those mice.   If stepmom gets mad about it, oh well.   Better a mad stepmom than a sick stepsibling.",

BUT. You should be given a designated time to do your loads. One white. One colour. One dark.

But you shouldnt have to. \n\nYou could offer to help with the other laundry, maybe say you want to \u2018contribute\u2019 to the family and would like to do something useful.

As a stepmother, mother, and a stepdaughter and daughter, I can see the hazy lines and I remember them very well. \n\nMy stepmother was an alcoholic and very tidy and organized. If my laundry was presented in a way that didn\u2019t satisfy my stepmother, she wouldn\u2019t wash it. She preferred everything to be separated by person/type of laundry. I also worked in a restaurant and didn\u2019t want to wash my regular clothes with greasy fryer oil laden clothes. \n\nThere were multiple adult \u201cchildren\u201d (ages 16-23) in our house, two steps including myself, and two bios to my stepmother. She did this with all of us. She wanted the laundry given to her neatly (not inside out, no socks stuck in pant legs etc) and she would always wash it, fold it, put it on hangers, back into the basket. I do the same for my four (2 step &amp; 2 bio) children. If we presented our laundry messy, she wouldn\u2019t wash it and it would accumulate. \n\nI can see both sides, but you must seek to understand\u2026you and your brother are both -adults-, and I don\u2019t know whether you work or drive, but if it\u2019s truly that much of an issue, to the point that you\u2019re describing, you\u2019re\u2026an adult\u2026go to a laundromat. I get that there\u2019s laundry \u201con site\u201d at your dad and SM\u2019s home, but it\u2019s also their machines, their detergent, and their electricity/gas/water running it. \n\nSeek to understand her hang ups with laundry, come from a place of sincerity, as difficult as it may be. Just because she\u2019s been an adult longer doesn\u2019t make her (for a lack of better words) \u201cadultier\u201d than you. \n\nThis sounds like it could be touching into mental health with her, as you are adult children moving in with her and their combined much younger children. It could feel like an invasion to her, and rightfully so, as you are both grown and raised essentially.",

I know with our combined four children, I do all laundry (kids are 14, 13, 9, 6), because I divvy out other chores for all the kids to help lighten the load. And that\u2019s after 4 years of us being a blended family. \n\nIt\u2019s taken a lot of work to get to this point, and to decide what tasks would be easier for me to complete versus what tasks I felt were appropriate for our kids. \n\nI want to reiterate how important it is for you to come from a place of respect and understanding.

I consider it something we could do together, as we are quite different personalities it is hard to find common ground sometimes. Tonight my partner flipped out at me and essentially got overly hurt with the fact that I keep winning. It\u2019s not that I set out with the intention of \u201cI\u2019m going to destroy her competitively\u201d - I\u2019ve just been gaming for far longer than she has. This little freak out tonight has completely ruined any chance we have of enjoying gaming together, to the point where I am seriously considering selling all of my Switch and the associated gear. \n\nFor more context we have been fighting quite a bit over the weekend, so there is that. But I\u2019m not going to apologize for being good at something, especially when I\u2019m not trying to be \u201coverly competitive\u201d - or at least I don\u2019t think that I am.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Because you've now entered the territory of \"You won't even try because you know I'll get upset if you beat me.\"\n\nIf anyone disagrees,you havent been in the position.\n\nCo-op style games are the way to go here. Overwatch, diablo things you can play together. Hell...even Mario Party can be an option because that's a lot of random.\n\nIf yall are fighting about this, hash it out.

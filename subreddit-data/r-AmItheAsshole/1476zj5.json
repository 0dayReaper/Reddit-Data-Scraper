    "postText": "I'm 15m and my friend (let's call him L) is 14m. We're from Britain so the food isn't US size.\n\nRight, for context, L is abnormally obese for his age and eats an abnormal amount. For example, on my bday we went out to an American style diner, where he had a \"House beef burger\" with extra bacon, onion rings and a portion of fries with a pint of cola to wash it down. That's alright but later on he had a packet of skittles and 500ml of coke, again! Later having a 330ml can of coke and even after all this he went to kfc and had a rice box with 3 wings and a large pepsi (whats that? 600ml?). Anyway that's just one day!\n\nThat's not all he eats this food like its gunna run away from him! He ate a large bar of dairy milk in like less than 5 minutes! And a full packet of digestives before the movies even started!!\n\nMe and my mates have always ripped on him for this but I think I'm harder about it, he's a great friend and I don't like to see him hurt himself like this. Anyway, I've always been down on him for it, I'll say things like, \"slow down you'll give yourself a heart attack\". He normally just storms off in a grump and go an eat more. All my other mates either have a go at me for it or they've given up on him and say he's a lost course. Am I helping or just making it worse?\n\nVery early update: it's obvious now my play in his problem, I'm going to try and change and help him rather than hurt him more. I'm sorry if I triggered any of you or upset you and say thank you for helping me realise what to do.",

This post kinda reads like making fun of him. You can talk to him and talk to his parents about getting help to get his eating under control. Once. Let him know you're worried about him and his health. At some point when you're together not eating so it's not as much an attack on his eating habits.\n\nAnd then you shouldn't really be talking about it more. Maybe you can invite him to participate in physical activity or other things with you that don't involve eating. But you shouldn't be talking to him about his eating habits on a regular basis. If he brings it up, you can talk about it. But if he's aware of your feelings, focus on the things you like, the things you have in common, and keep your thoughts about his eating to yourself. I guess you can make comments to your parents if you feel a need to comment, but he doesn't need pressure from you to lose weight.",

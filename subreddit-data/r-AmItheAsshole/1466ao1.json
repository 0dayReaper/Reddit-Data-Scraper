    "postText": "My parents have been married for almost 29 years. My brother and I are in our early 20's. My parents have always celebrated their anniversary by going for dinner or giving each other small gifts. They were never extravagant about it and I even forgot the date until recently.\nGrowing up, I never thought about it. I don't remember ever learning that kids were meant to celebrate for their parents and my parents never mentioned it.\n\nOver the last 2 or so years they have started making comments about how we've never celebrated their anniversary. They mentioned their own celebrations for their parents' milestone anniversaries and mention our lack of acknowledgements, gifts or celebration for theirs.\n\nFor context, I have always been a grateful and thoughtful kid. I help my parents without being asked all the time and I go over the top for their birthdays and Mother's Day and Father's Day. I really never thought I was lacking until they began to periodically bring this up.\n\nMy father says he never started doing celebrations for his parents until he was in his 20's. They say they're giving us a \"good-natured hard time\" but I am feeling guilty and weird. I'll gladly start celebrating but I don't think I'm in the wrong.\n\nAITA?",

Your parents have voiced that they\u2019d like you to start putting in some effort to celebrate their anniversary, and you\u2019ve already said that you\u2019ll gladly oblige. I don\u2019t think you were wrong, as you didn\u2019t know they felt that way. Equally, I understand where they\u2019re coming from - celebrating your parents\u2019 anniversary with a gift, or some other small gesture of acknowledgement, seems to become more of a norm as an adult than as a child. But as already mentioned, you didn\u2019t know this until recently and that isn\u2019t your fault. \n\nIn any case, your family manage seem to manage conflict in a pretty healthy way. No assholes here",

My personal view is that a card and call are nice for most anniversaries, dinner and gift for milestones and a big old party for their 50th. But better to ask what kinds of things they did for their parents or what they would like. Honestly 29 years married and going forward is a pretty big accomplishment when you think about it, as it sounds like they are happy and you have a good relationship with them.",

Honestly if it were a milestone anniversary like 30th than that might garner some expectations from them but even then i think the real question is how much flair are they expecting from you? How much celebrating are you expected to give them?",

Sometimes making dinner or bringing them breakfast to bed or similar small gestures. Important dates like 25 years (silver anniversary),  50 (gold anniversary) and  like, 30 and 40 in between are celebrated in a bigger family party. But maybe it's a cultural thing also.",

It's their history, their family culture.  If OP chooses to opt out, that's their call, but it's ridiculous to pretend that the parents anniversary has nothing to do with the kids who resulted from and grew up under that union.  \n\n4th of July has nothing to do with anyone currently alive, right?  Why does anyone celebrate?  Your birthday doesn't have anything to do with anyone other than you, right?  \n\nIdk, my *children* are excited to celebrate my partner and my's anniversary with/for us.  Because they understand that it was a big moment for our entire family, and want to celebrate that.  We've never pushed it, it's all their idea; so far they've made us cards on their own and insisted they help bake the anniversary cake - because they are excited to celebrate.  \n\nExpected?  Ehhh.  Understood that it's a very small gesture that can mean a lot *to people that I care about*?  Yeah, that.  My god, my partner's grandpa passed away and we made sure to reach out to his grandma on what would have been their anniversary - because it's a big thing in THEIR life and we love them, so OF COURSE we recognize the moments that are important to them, as they do for us.   It's such a small thing that lets others know we care about them.",

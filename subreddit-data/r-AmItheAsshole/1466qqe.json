    "postText": "I had a large table that was running an hour past closing. I really need my tips from the table. I did tell them the kitchen was closed and help pick up dishes. \n\nThe kitchen staff was not having it and started cleaning up loudly and the night closing head cook was getting annoyed with my table. The FOH manager doesn\u2019t control the kitchen. My table said it\u2019s so rude when the kitchen started blasting music to clean while the customer was still in the restaurant. \n\nI tried to get the staff to settle down but they turned the music up louder and started playing really weird metal. \n\nI felt like it hurt my chances of making a better tips for the night. \n\nThe table left and I went to say something to the kitchen staff and they basically laughed at me say I held them up for an hour and now everyone has to stay until the dishes are done. My manager made me sweep up and none of the bussers helped and I said I made shit tips on my last table and now I have to stay behind and clean. I didn\u2019t think it was fair and the head cook said I can stay just like the kitchen staff does because no one leaves until the dishes are done so I was there almost 2 hours past my shift and everyone thought I was a major dick for trying to keep my table happy so I could make better tips.",

Tell your customers to leave when it\u2019s an hour past closing.

And then you complain that you had to stay later than you wanted to. Just, wow. How do you think the kitchen staff were feeling an hour after closing knowing that you were still holding them up so that you might get a better tip?",

I really need my tips from the table. I did tell them the kitchen was closed and help pick up dishes. \n\nThe kitchen staff was not having it and started cleaning up loudly and the night closing head cook was getting annoyed with my table. The FOH manager doesn\u2019t control the kitchen. My table said it\u2019s so rude when the kitchen started blasting music to clean while the customer was still in the restaurant. \n\nI tried to get the staff to settle down but they turned the music up louder and started playing really weird metal. \n\nI felt like it hurt my chances of making a better tips for the night. \n\nThe table left and I went to say something to the kitchen staff and they basically laughed at me say I held them up for an hour and now everyone has to stay until the dishes are done. My manager made me sweep up and none of the bussers helped and I said I made shit tips on my last table and now I have to stay behind and clean. I didn\u2019t think it was fair and the head cook said I can stay just like the kitchen staff does because no one leaves until the dishes are done so I was there almost 2 hours past my shift and everyone thought I was a major dick for trying to keep my table happy so I could make better tips.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Regardless of how the tips are shared, some people are saying not to give \"extra\" service to this table, and that's not a fair comment to make. Sounds like you were stuck with the table and did your best to make the best tip you could.

    "postText": "My (M26) sister (F23) runs a bakery business and she\u2019s been struggling lately to keep up with orders because she\u2019s been short staffed. She does a lot of orders for wedding cakes that require custard or marmalade fillings, and I offered to help her out by making these fillings at home and bringing them to her so she has less work to do.\n\nUnfortunately, the past four times I\u2019ve made these fillings, my girlfriend (F24) has literally dipped her fingers into the filling jars and contaminated them because, in her words, she \u201cjust wanted to try some.\u201d I\u2019ve tried explaining to her that she can\u2019t dip her fingers in and contaminate the entire batch, because then I have to remake it. I said she should use a spoon and take some out if she wants to try so bad, but she just pouts and says that she likes using her fingers because it takes her back to her childhood.\n\nToday, I was trying to finish some chocolate custard to send it over to my sister really fast because she was running late on a wedding cake order for an important client. I told my girlfriend beforehand to not eat the custard, and if she really wanted to, to please use a spoon. \n\nI get out of the shower, and what do I see? She has her fingers in it again! I totally lost it because this is the fifth time she blatantly disregarded what I said, and I yelled at her and told her to \u201cstop fucking eating\u201d the food I\u2019m making, because it\u2019s not for her and she\u2019s contaminating it. \n\nShe started crying and got mad at me for \u201cfat-shaming\u201d her, even though I made no comment on her weight and she has no history of weight issues or eating disorders. I know I was harsh, but she kept pushing my limits. AITA?",

Don\u2019t apologize - not even for your wording, tone, etc. You said she has never had issues with weight and you made it perfectly clear that was not the issue. I\u2019m still not well educated on the subject, but she may have used gaslighting here as she\u2019s trying to make you think you did something that you clearly did not do (fat-shaming). So don\u2019t apologize. In fact, as the way your sister makes a living is what\u2019s on the line here, do the exact opposite and have this reaction EVERY TIME your gf does this.",

No takeouts unless she is paying?) since she insists on playing a child, or have a heart to heart along the following lines -\n\n\"I'm not your father. I'm not your mother. You are an adult, and while I understand that you want to relive your childhood, what you are doing is actively attempting to harm my sister's business and your conduct could make someone very sick, or at worst, dead. Do you want your actions to be the cause of someone's pain? Do you understand that you playing at being chidlish could cost so many different people, including people dear to me, so many different things? Resources? Because now I have the make the custard again. My sister's business? Her good name? Her customer's health?\"\n\n(Keeping in mind that there are plenty of allergies where gf could be the source of a cross-contamination. Say, she got into some peanuts first and did not wash her hands.) Because this realistically can happen. That is why there are tons of health and safety regulations when it comes to handling food. In some countries you can't even do it out of your own kitchen, you gotta have a commercial one up to par with the legislations, even if it's outside in a shed, as long as it ticks the boxes.\n\nI mean I guess he can also ask whether she is trying to prove something to someone or is deliberate in her actions of ruining the batches even after OP offered a reasonable compromise. As it was pointed out, jealousy over attention to OP's sister could be a factor, or a \"two birds with one stone\" case.\n\nIn the spirit of Anton Ego from Ratatouille, food is *not* a game. You can play around with it, but you always have to respect it. Yes, I'm also quite frequently angered by the \"food fight\" scenes in movies.\n\n(Or, well, depending on whose place it is, moving out. Or getting a small fridge with a lock.)",

They know not to do that but I honestly can't imagine the audacity of doing that the first time let alone multiple times. After the second time, I would have forbade that person from the kitchen. She has done it five times. That is deliberate.\n\nSide note OP: i will preface this with i don't know where you are located. Where I am, if you are a licensed commercial kitchen, you can't have outside food that was made in a home kitchen used in your commercial kitchen. Especially things like custards. I legally can't even make that due to how my areas cottage food laws are written. If a commercial entity gets caught with using home based prepared food in their commercial kitchen, there are hefty fines attached. It's not considered food safe. I would personally delete this post after you get the answer you want, so no one goes poking around trying to figure out where you are. Good luck to your sister. Weddings can be super stressful.",

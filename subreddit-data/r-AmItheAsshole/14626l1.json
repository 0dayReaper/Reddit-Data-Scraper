    "postText": "\nMy husband invited MIL to visit (she\u2019s 5 hours away) this past week. They also decided, without involving me in the conversation, that our kids (12,14) would be going home with her for a visit when she left. I don\u2019t have any problem with her visiting, especially when it\u2019s planned. For the first 10 years of our relationship his parents would just show up at our door unannounced and stay for 5 days. This obviously caused some major issues between us. They eventually learned that they had to give us advance notice since we had kids, jobs, lives, etc. \n\nSomehow this visit went from being MIL, to MIL, his sister, and her 2 kids (7, 9 months) coming as well. It\u2019s not clear if she invited herself or if MIL invited her. I wasn\u2019t included in that conversation either. I love the kids and the 7 year old is my sweet little sidekick, but I also started a new job a few months ago and it is very stressful and demanding, so that\u2019s a lot of unexpected visitors to accommodate and feed. While they\u2019re here, my stepson, his wife, and her 2 kids are also here every day/evening. So in addition to the 4 of us, there are an additional 8 people in the house when I get home from work.\n\nSince the kids still living at home were leaving I looked into taking a quick getaway trip for just the two of us and requested a few days off work. He asked his mom if she would be willing to stay and kid/dog sit for the 3 days but she declined. She doesn\u2019t like dogs or animals in general. No big deal, we made other arrangements for the dogs. I asked my husband repeatedly when she would be heading home so I could plan our trip, but he didn\u2019t know and she would not give him a date. This is not new, she has always avoided giving telling how long she\u2019ll be staying. \n\nThe night before they were set to arrive, she called and said they would stay through the weekend. My SIL\u2019s nephew (my husband\u2019s brother\u2019s wife\u2019s nephew) passed away under very sad circumstances and she wanted to stay for the funeral, but didn\u2019t know when it would be. Mind you, she met the nephew once when he was a child at their wedding but didn\u2019t really know him. By this time we had already cancelled the trip plans but still planned to spend time alone together. I was upset at the last minute change and that she had already left the visit open ended, but even that was extended to a further unknown date. My husband then got furious with me for being frustrated with the situation. Not mad, but definitely frustrated, and he thinks I owe him an apology for \u201cruining\u201d his time with his mother by being frustrated. My relationship with my family is very strained so I don\u2019t always know if my feelings are valid or if it\u2019s because of my upbringing, but I also feel that it\u2019s basic houseguest etiquette to tell your hosts how long you will be staying. AITA?",

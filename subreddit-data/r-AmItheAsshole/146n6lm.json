You don't owe anyone an explanation for why you can't attend. It's been over 10 years since you've seen each other, so don't worry about what others may think. Just politely decline and wish your friend all the best. It's their baby shower, not yours.",

You haven\u2019t seen each other and barely have spoken in a decade .. but you\u2019re good enough to be invited to buy a gift for a baby you\u2019re realistically never going to have a relationship with. This may be the unpopular opinion but People love to do this with weddings and baby showers basically so they get more gifts and money, otherwise it would only be people that are actually involved in their lives invited.",

This baby shower will probably not, and is likely to be detrimental to your mental health.\n\nPut yourself first. Plead a prior engagement (preferably one that's out of the country!), send your best wishes and a gift if you think it appropriate, then don't give it another thought.\n\nI don't attend school reunions for similar reasons. Not that I'm disappointed with how my life turned out, but attending reunions would trigger many unhappy memories and lead to questions that I really don't feel like answering. If I had wanted to stay friends with my former classmates, I'd have chosen to keep in touch.",

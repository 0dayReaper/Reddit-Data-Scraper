Really harp on the \"you get your own party this year\" to sister, she'll run with it as all children would, and if you have your sister doing the dirty work because you know mom will give in, this could be a win-win all around.",

It's not fair of your mother to expect you to share your personal rite of passage with your younger sister. Every girl deserves to feel special and have the spotlight on her quincea\u00f1era. Your sister can have her own sweet 15 or 16 when it's her time.",

However, I\u2019m not completely Mexican. I am a mixed baby and I\u2019m not close with many people from my dad\u2019s side (the Mexican side of my family). However, I still feel like I am entitled to, at the bare minimum, be able to wear the beautiful dress and have a small celebration. Of course inviting people from my dad\u2019s side. This isn\u2019t where the issue is though. The issue is with my younger sister. Me and my younger sister are 9 years apart. She\u2019s a rainbow baby. And this makes my mom think that she is entitled to everything I own and do. I\u2019ve had to share a birthday with her since she was born. My 10th birthday party became my sisters 1st birthday party. After my sisters 3rd birthday I was done with birthday parties because they always revolved around her. And I know it sounds like I\u2019m being a spoiled teen but it\u2019s the truth. I have been shoved to the side since she\u2019s been born. But on to the main issue, I was showing my mom the dress I had chosen. The dress is flowy and purple with gorgeous accents. It\u2019s also fairly priced. The tiara I want is also a beautiful piece that accents the gown. As me and my mom were talking about it and scrolling through other dresses to make sure this is the one I want she came across a dark purple dress that came in my sisters size. It was an eye catcher to say the least. My mom raved over that dress for my sister for my Quincea\u00f1era. The dress would outshine mine, a quite plain dress but was still gorgeous nonetheless. I started getting a bit upset because the dress she picked out for my sister was a lot more eye-catching than mine. I told my mom \u201cIf you want to get her a dress at least get one that wouldn\u2019t out do me on a day about me and becoming closer with MY heritage.\u201d My mom was mad. She began yelling at me saying my sister had every right to a dress like mine and a tiara like mine. And how she was going to pay for my Damas dresses and mine. But here\u2019s the kicker, I\u2019ve worked it out with my Damas that we would pay the majority of the price for their dresses and they would pay the rest. And I\u2019ve been working a lot at my summer job and saved up money for a few of the dresses already. But, after she had said that I blew up. Here\u2019s where I may be the AH, I told her that my sister doesn\u2019t have any mexican family besides me because both of her parents are white. And I understand that she won\u2019t get a Quincea\u00f1era but that day is supposed to be a day where I shine out not my sister for once. And I only turn 15 once and this is a chance for me to get closer to my dad\u2019s side because my dad was never really around and I never learned a lot about my dad\u2019s side. My Quincea\u00f1era is in 4 months and I feel really bad about what I said but I genuinely don\u2019t think I am the AH. I know it\u2019s not my sisters fault that my mom is the way she is so I have no right to get mad at my sister. But AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

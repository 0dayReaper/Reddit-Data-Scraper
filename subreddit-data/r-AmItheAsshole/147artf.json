I'm a simple woman, I just want him to play video games with me, take me to McDonalds here and there, watch movies ect. \n\nWe were okay for a while this time round, until he started playing WoW again. He runs a guild and it takes up ALL of his time. If he isnt working he is on that game. I have to book to see him a week in advance when we live 5 mins from each other. \n\nNow, the problem here is that my birthday is coming up - on Thursday. For the past 6 months, Wednesday's and Thursday's are 'raid' days. Meaning he is \"unavailable\" basically all day. I wanted to see him on Thursday, on my birthday, as my mum would be working and I am seeing the rest of my family Friday and Saturday. He said no to Thursday, but he wants me to cancel my plans on Friday to see him. WIBTA for not cancelling my family plans, and being annoyed he won't give up his game for ONE day out the year?",

This is really straightforward. It\u2019s honestly kind of pathetic that you\u2019ve done the break up/get back together thing more than once if this is how he is but I remember being 21 and also doing pathetic things in relationships so I get it. Have more self respect for yourself.",

He knows your standards are low, and he knows your expectations are non existent because you let him talk all over them every time. \nEnd this relationship and go into dating with form boundaries about how you will and will not accept being treated and anytime someone is behaving outside of them you move on.",

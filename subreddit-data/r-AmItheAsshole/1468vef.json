We\u2019ve had our bad moments but overall it\u2019s been well. \n\nSo this week I realized that my front brakes on my car are really low, so I made an appointment to get them fixed in a few days. I decided I shouldn\u2019t drive unless I absolutely had to, (i.e. work and back home) so that I don\u2019t mess up the rotors. \n\nWell yesterday I had a person reach out to buy some clothes from me online, and before I realized I probably shouldn\u2019t drive my car to meet this person, I asked my boyfriend if he could take me to meet the girl. He said yes and that it was no big deal. We often help each other out in this way. Last night we got into a little argument and he got mad at me and said I should ask my dad to drive me to meet the girl and that he didn\u2019t want to take me anymore. I told him I would just tell the girl I\u2019d meet her another day after my brakes got fixed and we left it at that. \n\nWell this morning when I woke up, my friend had asked if I wanted to go shopping/run errands with her. I said yes and that I had to stop by a store to meet and sell the clothes to a girl, she said it worked out great because she had to go to that store as well! So I planned on going with my friend. I carry on my morning and get ready for work, I realize that my boyfriend is ignoring me and then he leaves for work without saying anything to me\u2026 no hug or kiss or anything. So I texted him and asked if he was mad that I was going to go with my friend, he never responded. I\u2019m assuming (because it\u2019s happened before) that he\u2019s mad because I found someone else to take me because he told me he wasn\u2019t going to. \n\nDoes anyone else\u2019s partner ignore them when they are mad, and is that an unhealthy coping mechanism? Also did I do anything wrong for trying to solve my problem when he said he didn\u2019t want to help? \n\n\nTLDR; Boyfriend got mad at me and decided not to help with me a favor and has been ignoring me all day\u2026",

He deals with dysfunctional family dynamics, and you'll definitely find good reference to various coping mechanisms in his videos.",

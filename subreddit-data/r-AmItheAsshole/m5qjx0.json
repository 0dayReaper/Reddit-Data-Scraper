Yesterday since it had already been days of us not talking. I listened to ur comments and decided to ask how would she feel if I told her only one of her parents could go cause *my* moms are uncomfortable around heterosexual couples. \n\nShe basically laughed and said it\u2019s not the same thing because that\u2019s a \u201cnormal couple\u201d. That kinda got me and I asked what\u2019s not normal about my moms. Think that\u2019s when she saw she fucked up with what she said. She said she didn\u2019t mean it like that and just knows it would be awkward and weird because her parents don\u2019t like that.\n\nThen I asked her if *she* would feel like that too. And she didn\u2019t say anything. We talked for a while and she still wasn\u2019t getting how this would hurt my moms asking them to hide who they are. Then it got to where she admitted it would also be embarrassing for her parents would know I have two moms.\n\nAnd yeah I wasn\u2019t gonna take that and told her we\u2019re done. Not gonna be w someone who\u2019s embarrassed about my moms or doesn\u2019t want others to know. That was it. \n\nMy friends haven\u2019t said anything to me yet but think I\u2019m just gonna block them out cause I don\u2019t wanna deal with their shit rn.\n\n\nI know I said in my comments I was thinking abut  asking my moms for advice but since we\u2019re broke up I\u2019m not gonna tell them why. I only told my moms it wasn\u2019t working out with her so we\u2019re done. \n\nThey dont need to why cause I don\u2019t want them to feel is their fault and they really liked my girlfriend. This would hurt their feelings knowing she was feeling that way. \n\nIts not my first break up but it still really sucks and I\u2019m feeling sad. It is what it is though. Thanks for everyone\u2019s help and for telling me ur own experiences.",

Not because you're negligent or irresponsible as you've proven you are quite amazing at protecting your loved ones, but because you're human and we can all be a bit blah sometimes.   \n    \nBe careful of your creeping emotions and work through them. I'm only like twice your age, but I'm very proud of you. I always wished I had little brothers, but today I feel kinship. If you want some relationship advice or just someone to back n forth with about life or direction or just shooting the shit then HMU!",

But maybe like in a questioning way if they knew her. That way he doesn't feel like he's just telling to tell. Ask if they liked her or if they had an off-feeling. Say that he knows he did the right thing, is completely certain of that, but is wondering if there is something they picked up on that he didn't. That kind of thing. If that's not something he's interested in, telling them just to tell them is still a good idea, I think. \n\nThings always get out eventually. Will they be hurt he hid this?  Will they think that he didn't feel he could trust them with this information? They are the parents, and even though he handled this with admirable grace and maturity, he is still a kid, still their responsibility. They are moms. \n\nMy mom won't ever say a bad word about anyone I have ever dated. Not even guys I broke up with 20 years ago. When I was younger and coming to her for advice this didn't work out well. It's one thing to not say anything during a relationship or if there's a possibility of getting back together, sometimes, but after, or if they aren't a good person and I don't see it, staying silent helps no one. In my ignorance I took her silence as approval (she never *said* that she would never say anything bad) instead of disapproval. Approval came with words. This led me to not trust my own instincts and got me into some very dangerous situations. Moms are valuable resources if you use them, and they let you.",

People will always be weird or mean hearted, but how you handle and perceive it is what makes you.\n\nI\u2019m sure your parents are very proud of you for standing up for what\u2019s right, yourself and for them.\n\nTest tube babies unite!",

Share your posts and all the comments you received.  Your mom's clearly raised a very kind, logical, compassionate human being.  They should be proud of themselves too.  Great job OP!",

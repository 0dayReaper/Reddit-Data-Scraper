Please view our [voting guide here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what.2019s_with_these_acronyms.3F_what_do_they_mean.3F), and remember to use **only one** judgement in your comment.\n\nOP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:\n\n &gt; 1. The action I did was that i told two other women in the class that Jane would use submissions frowned upon in the class and was overly aggressive, and Jane took offense that I did this, saying I was needlessly badmouthing her. \n\n2. This action mah make me an asshole as I went behind her back and talked about her to two other people, which may have made her mad. Furthermore I largely ignored her coaching.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Allow them to address the issue. \nNow if you know she is there regularly and the other belts you talked to are as well, it should have been more along the lines of questioning if they have always noticed her doing these things or if maybe she had a bad day and thought as a blue belt you could handle it.  It would have been fair to let them know that you had asked her several times to tone down her aggressiveness of those moves and she didn\u2019t with makes you concerned someone will get hurt. \nYou said you\u2019re just back after a long break. Is this something the instructors may have been allowing her to practice?  Because as instructors seeing someone preform moves that they have not taught how to execute safely and taught others what to expect and how to move, this would be concerning due to the risk of someone getting hurt. \nIf the instructors didn\u2019t address it, you move up the chain of command. And at that point warn others. \nIt sounds to me like you went straight to earning others without making inquiries or going to instructors. This makes you a little A H. But I also understand why you did it. Her reaction or she gets to decide how hard she goes is technically right, but she also needs to do so at such a level to accommodate who she is against.

In that the instructor wasn\u2019t present and it was a student led practice, with possibly a higher ranked belt being around. If the instructor was around they should have stopped the sparring or stepped in.\n\nI don\u2019t know how exactly Jiu-Jitsu classes are organized but in my experience with martial arts classes if it\u2019s a class the instructor is present teaching and monitoring the students. If it\u2019s practice the instructor isn\u2019t necessarily present sometimes a high ranking student is placed in charge of the practice. And it\u2019s only practicing moves and forms recently taught with no sparring.\n\nWhite belts assuming my look up is correct are beginners like the literal starting point of jiu-jitsu which tracks with my experience. Blue belt being the next rank above that. My assumptions is that this was a student led practice amongst white belts and blue belts with hopefully at least a higher belt rank observing. If not then I\u2019d advise leaving that class where it\u2019s being taught. As martial arts classes shouldn\u2019t have an inattentive instructor. \n\nMeaning that if the instructor was there they should have stopped your sparring the instant moves were being used that were not taught. It\u2019s not like a sport that you choose what pace you learn moves at the instructor sets the pace for a reason. Leg locks are especially dangerous because pressure applied wrong can easily dislocate or break something. And if it\u2019s moves above what a belt level they should know that\u2019s especially not ok. Effectively it would be like throwing kicks when all that\u2019s been taught is punches and guards for punches.",

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\n\nI (31M) am a blue belt who recently returned to training after a significant break. Jane (25F), a white belt woman, has been practicing BJJ for a little over a year. She's quite passionate about the sport, and loves John danaher and idolizes Gordon Ryan. Our instructor doesn't cover leglocks in our class for good reason, but Jane took it upon herself to learn them through the Danaher videos.\n\nThe Incident:\nDuring one of our rolls, I was paired up with Jane. She wasted no time and pulled guard, swiftly transitioning to a single-leg X guard. Her technique was impressive, but her eagerness to secure a heel hook worried me. I managed to avoid her initial attempts, but she persisted, refusing to listen to my concerns. I became increasingly concerned when she aggressively targeted submissions, including leglocks that hadn't been taught in our class. She was extremely aggressive when we were rolling, when i was trying to not use my strength to simply overpower her, because neither i nor she would benefit from it. After all we arent trying to beat each other, we're trying to get better at jiu jitsu. She did not show the same courtesy and she loves to go for stuff like neck cranks, wrist locks, crossfaces, i think she even went for a kani basami before she fell onto her face on her own.\nPolitely, I requested that Jane refrain from applying such techniques, explaining that I hadn't learned them yet and would prefer to focus on the techniques taught by our instructor. Unfortunately, my requests fell on deaf ears. Jane continued to disregard my concerns and persisted in attacking my legs throughout the roll. As the roll continued, Jane shifted to an outside ashi garami and initiated a straight ankle lock. She cranked it hard, and despite my immediate tap, she held on for an extra second before releasing the submission. This left me feeling frustrated and concerned for my safety. In response, during the next roll I transitioned into a dominant position called the crucifix hold. This position allowed me to maintain control over her movements and assert my boundaries until the time limit expired, without resorting to excessive force. I did not attempt to submit her because I no longer wished to roll with her. \n\nPost-Roll Fallout:\nOnce the class concluded, I approached Abby, a new white belt, and cautioned her about Jane's approach during rolls. \nAdditionally, I warned Julia, another blue belt who is new to our gym, to be cautious when rolling with Jane due to her tendency to roll with excessive force.\n\nJane learned this, confronted me, and accused me of alienating her from our training community. She said she should get to decide how hard she wants go with her partners on her own terms.  Am I the asshole for addressing Jane's behavior during our jiu-jitsu class?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Is she in anyway related to Rousimar Palhares?? \n\nAnybody that refuses to let go of subs immediately is a major AH.  Next time, go straight to your instructor though.  I tore my meniscus last year because another Palhares wannabe wrenched a knee bar on me.  I required surgery and was out 7 months.",

Someone who is *this* obsessive about the idea that women are out for his money is likely going to be cultivating other fucked-up resentments, too. Someone who is willing to bully a schoolteacher out of $500 in the middle of a massive economic collapse is probably going to be willing to disregard her material security, or even her safety, in other ways, too. \n\nOP shouldn't be surprised when witnessing her brother's subsequent relationships turns out to be much more stressful, heartbreaking, and infuriating than this one.",

I knew of a very successful attorney who came from money and had a wife who was also an attorney but had student debts, etc. They had a prenup. When they split (with no kids, thank God) she didn't ask for anything from him. No property, no alimony, etc. He spent the next 10 years trying to go after her in court for petty nonsense, to the point where he was brought in front of the bar for frivolous litigation.\n\nHis behavior had nothing to do with protecting his assets and everything to do with the fact that he lost something he thought he had control over.",

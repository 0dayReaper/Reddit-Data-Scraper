Maybe you should explain to your mom that her life does matter but that when she invited you to hangout at a carnival all you wanted was quality time with her and had you known that it entailed being her photographer, assistant, and being verbal put down then you never would have come therefore you need to reevaluate future time with her unless she reevaluates her actions.",

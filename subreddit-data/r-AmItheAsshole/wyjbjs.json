The OP isn't upset that the sister didn't attend the wedding. By all means, if the sister is afraid for her dog's health, stay with the dog. But the parents can still leave to attend a wedding, for crying out loud. The sister can attend to her dog alone for an evening.\n\nI just have gone through this with a family member losing a beloved pet that they'd had for over 20 years. It was heartbreaking. But I have no doubt that if there was a wedding to attend, my family member would urge me to attend.",

Most were too old, frail or sick to attend the wedding.\n\nSo, naturally, we had a mock ceremony after the fact in their reception hall in full wedding attire so they could all \"attend\". Then a special dinner with cake and everything. \n\nMoral of the story is it's nice to be able to share something so special with those who mean the most to us.

His disability does often mean that he has to cancel plans even when he *wants* to do something, but that wasn't the problem- he was going through a GI issue 6 months before the wedding and said he wasn't coming. He hadn't seen a specialist yet but he had made an appointment for 4-5 months before the wedding. \n\nEvery suggestion made for his comfort was denied by him. We even costed out hiring a home health aide for the day to accompany and then drive him home at a reasonable time. But nope, he just wasn't going to come. \n\nOkay, fine, we accepted his choice- it's his body, after all, even though I personally think he should have spoken to the doctor before finalizing his decision SIX MONTHS OUT- but then he began to wail that he wouldn't have anyone home with him for almost 2 days. Close friends offered to stop by before and after the wedding to check up on him, leaving him home alone for 10 hours on the wedding day- something he experiences on a weekly basis- but it wasn't good enough. He had to have my wonderful, kind MIL there. He demanded that she leave the reception after the mother/son dance so she could make him dinner. \n\nIt seems like I'm being harsh on a poor disabled man, but he is perfectly capable of being home alone and heating up prepared meals even on his worst days. He's done it many, many times even with the recent health issue. No, he's a narcissist who has weaponized his illness and I'll prove it with the next line:\n\nWhen MIL refused to leave the reception early, he demanded that she not be in any pictures. In fact, *he didn't want his wife and other kids in any pictures because it would highlight the fact that he wasn't there and he wouldn't be able to show his relatives (who my husband has never met) the photos.* \n\nSo, obviously husband and I ignored that. MIL and siblings were in tons of photos and he can suck a duck. Because I love MIL and I don't want her to have to deal with his temper tantrums, FIL has only seen a carefully curated album without his own fucking family in it. \n\nAnd he wonders why I call MIL \"Mom\" while I barely speak to him.\n\n**this comment really got away from me, sorry",

Those people cared more about emotional abusers feeling humiliated, than OP being emotionally abused and neglected. They\u2019re just as bad as the parent *and sister* - more need to mention the sister is an asshole too, because it\u2019s not a coincidence that she always has something happen on OP\u2019s big days.",

As others have mentioned, everyone knew they weren't at the wedding so the video wasn't revealing some dark secret, just their shitty behavior.\n\nYou mention your sister having meltdowns. Does your sister have a disability, developmental delay, TBI or otherwise need care? Because that is the only reason I can see as to why your parents need to constantly help her. But she should probably be in an adult group home of have a professional taking care of her. Your parents should not be neglecting you in their efforts to help your sister. But also, if your sister does have one of the above, it is misleading not to have included it for context. Sometimes people will change their judgments if you leave out important details like that.\n\nEdit: I just saw that you answered this question from another comment. I'm sorry that you have such a terrible sister. I am a big fan of family is   who you choose. You might consider going LC or NC with them, it will improve your well being. Congrats on the wedding and having great friends who love and support you!",

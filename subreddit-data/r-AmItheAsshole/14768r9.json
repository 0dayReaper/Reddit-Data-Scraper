This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nOkay, so my wife (34f) and I (36m) needed a new car as my wife\u2019s old car was slowly breaking down (the mechanic even said it might be best to just drive it until it dies) and we needed a bigger car with more cargo space for our growing family.\n\nI took on all of the car research and negotiation. I asked my wife several times about the car she is interested in and she wasn\u2019t too interested and mostly trusted me with the process. I had her test drive the car we were looking at and she approved. I included her on our loan pre approval (this will change). \n\nYesterday I left to chase a lead a ways away and just so happened to find the exact car we liked and negotiated a good price. My wife approved of the purchase, but because she wasn\u2019t there, her name isn\u2019t on the forms. No problem.\n\nI get home and we\u2019re all having fun with the car, when I happened to mention that I\u2019d be able to get to and from work on one charge (it\u2019s a PHEV) and she is somewhat surprised and says \u201coh, so it\u2019s your car?\u201d I explained that it\u2019s a family car, but since she works from home and just needs a car to drop our sons off at daycare (about 1.5 miles away) that it made more sense for me to use it since I commute 12 miles each way. I also said this was a family car, so whoever needs it should use it. She kinda said that it made sense, but that she felt she was getting a new car since it was replacing her old one. She basically felt like she was getting the hand me down. I thought that was the end.\n\nMy wife had barely any sleep last night, and apparently it was because she felt stupid and that she should have taken a more active role in researching the car, and was also worried because she no longer has her \u201cown\u201d car as both are now under my name. She also said she felt \u201cvulnerable\u201d but she didn\u2019t think I was going to try and screw her or anything. She said she mainly just felt embarrassed and stupid. I told her the new car can be \u201chers\u201d and she\u2019ll drive it if it would gave her piece of mind. She said \u201cno, it is more practical for me to use the car for commuting.\n\nI feel like I might be the AH here for unintentionally misleading my wife about how the car would be used. So, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

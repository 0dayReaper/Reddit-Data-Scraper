    "postText": "\nI wanna preface this by saying that I f34 married my husband m37 a year ago. His mom is snoopy and annoying af. She can't help it that is just how she is as my dear in laws say.\n\n\nMy husband and I purchased a new house recently. My MIL kept pushing to get an emergency key, She promised that she only use it in an emergency but giving the fact that she had an emergency key to our old apartment and walked in on us being intimate twice (but my husband didn't think it was big deal) I just couldn't trust her so I just sent her a fake key (after she kept pushing) and she had a smug on her face after I hand delivered it to her.\n\n\nDays gone by and on Christmas dinner MIL angerily \"called me out\" on the fact I gave her a fake copy of the house key. She shamed me for doing this in front of everyone but in my defensive I asked her how she found out and she said days ago when she came over at 4 while my husband and were out. I reminded her \"didn't you promise you wouldn't use it unless there's an emergency? So You tried to get in when there was no emergency and you broke the promise you made to us!\" She looked red in the face and the other family started staring and some even laughed at her for the face she made. She suddenly got up from her seat and rushed into the kitchen where she had a huge meltdown so loud the next door neighbors must've heard - literally I've never heard a 60+ year old woman throw a tantrum like that. Needless to say dinner went awkward and my husband and his sister were giving me looks. My husband went off on me in the car and said I lied and manipulated and humiliated and exposed his mom and said he wouldn't have let me get away with it had he known. We had an argument and he is demanding I apologize to his mom for my childish behavior and for ruining Christmas dinner for the whole family.\n\nAITA?\n\nEta so this went off unexpectedly and I thought I'd show my husband some pretty helpful comments I found here minutes ago but he got mad at me when he saw it and said I was nuts to talk about his family online. He demanded my phone so he could delete it but I refused and I went upstairs and into the bedroom. I never seen him so agitated and I didn't think he'd react like that honestly. But thank you guys for your support. It really means so much. I'll update if I can. Thanks again :)",

There's just so much wrong with the MIL's conduct in this story. Nightmare fuel. It would take A LOT to repair my relationship with my husband, snapping out of it or not it shouldn't have taken this level of absolute insanity to make it happen. He would have to attend regular weekly counselling on his own, then couples counselling with me twice a month until things started to show real improvements, if they did, for me to be able to continue.",

Obviously they thought the entire thing was nuts and it was dismissed but grandparents can become outrageous when they don't get their way. I was always very firm that his mom would NOT get a key to my home. I'm no longer with him since he was a giant mama's boy himself. Thankfully my husband is not a mama or daddy's boy and is also a good father.",

After we broke up and had a custody agreement in place she ended doing his weekends and his turn on the holidays for years when he moved away.

The majority of CPS is understaffed and underfunded and will not put their time into a case with no merit (obviously you'll be able to pull out specific anecdotal cases, but they're the rare minority). Depending on how thin the agency's resources are stretched that day, CPS will even pass on cases that should be taken if the child is not in immediate danger. CPS is set up in such a way that it is better if the child stays with their family and removal is used as a last resort.\n\nEdit: CPS is not perfect and has many issues that are common occurrences. However, wrongful removal is not one of them\n\nEverything else you said is spot on",

I was retaliated against and lost my job and sued them under the whistleblower protection act. Some states are better than others, but all are deeply flawed. People should absolutely call as a last resort because children need protection  but they need to understand that it should not be a frivolous or light choice because of the what they may be subjecting a family to, which may be worse than whatever the allegations. I\u2019ve seen babies put up for adoption who had appropriate kin placements who wanted them. Workers lying under oath or in official documentation and the state covering it up, children lost for months under state supervision  and being found murdered, foster care used as a threat to get parents to comply ajd agreee w a worker, blatant instances of abuse ignored b/c of lack of skill and pride/ego to admit they were wrong and being afraid of lawsuits.  Amd that\u2019s just some of it. Yes we need to look out for kids in our community, but we need to overhaul the cps system and people need to have their eyes open to the reality of what they\u2019re calling in and that many families who are silenced are left worse than when they were found. It being a hard job cannot be aj excuse to fail ajd often hurt families, just like it\u2019s not acceptable for tired stressed cops to accidentally shoot people.",

I just looked it up and saw this on the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_You_Forever#Reception):\n\n&gt;Some readers dislike the portion of the story where the mother sneaks into her grown son's home. One Publishers Weekly reviewer states that Love You Forever is a divisive children's book. \"Either it moves you to tears and you love it, or it makes your skin crawl and you detest it...\" A commentator wrote \"it's either a touching account of a mother's unending love or the ultimate helicopter parenting gone bad.\"\n\nI also saw this further down. Maybe OP needs to send a copy of this version to her husband and MIL, haha:\n\n&gt;Playwright Topher Payne wrote an alternative ending to the story, in which the mother is forced to recognize the son's need for personal space, and they instead agree to share their time doing things together.\n\nIf anyone is actually interested, [it's a free download on Topher Payne's site](https://www.topherpayne.com/love-you-forever). I read it and it's hilarious. The son installs security bars in his window, so his mom can't sneak in.",

The husband is sacrificing his spouse\u2019s reasonable right to privacy and security in her own home on the altar of his mother\u2019s giant ego. \n\nFirst, this whole \u201cshe can\u2019t help being intrusive\u201d narrative is nonsense. One has to make a conscious effort to show up to someone else\u2019s home unannounced and enter without an invitation repeatedly. \n\nSecond, the husband has to have several screws loose to think that spousal intimacy is a family spectator sport. \n\nThird, the mother is creepy as hell for continuing to show up unannounced despite walking in on her adult son &amp; his wife repeatedly. Does she have any pointers to add to his game, too? \n\nFourth, if this is someone who has zero reservations regarding intruding on their intimate moments, something tells me that snooping through their personal belongings is not above possibility. Otherwise, why was she there? \n\nOP, tell your husband as such: while he might think it hunky-dory that his mother walked in on your intimacy, you found it an egregious invasion of your privacy, and following this situation, you tested his mother to see whether she would respect your boundaries, since he doesn\u2019t have any. She lied, and she failed. \n\nHe needs to establish boundaries *now* before this woman is demanding that you give birth with her in the room and he stands silently by as you defend your right to basic autonomy. And she will. \n\nNTA, OP.",

You just haven't realized it yet. It starts as you're overreacting or reading too much into a situation. Then you are gaslit into believing the truth is a lie and you must be confused - there's something wrong with you. Then (if it hasn't happened already) the friends or family who support you? They're interfering and you need to stay away from them. And since you can't remember things and be depended on not to overreact, you clearly shouldn't be handling bank accounts or any significant amount of money.\n\nLittle by little you will lose yourself. Your life will be controlled and will suffocate you. I see it already in some of your responses (and the fact that you are here because you can't believe the truth that your brain is telling you...that this is fucked up). One day you will wake up with zero self esteem...you will have lost yourself and believe the lies the people who seek to control and manipulate tell you because they will have convinced you that not only can't they trust you, but you can no longer trust yourself.\n\nI am a survivor of abuse. There were never any bruises nor lasting scars. Even after I escaped, it took years for me to understand that I was abused and how insidious emotional and mental abuse is. Not to minimize ANY abuse, but sometimes I think bruises and scars might have been easier. People would have believed me. I might have believed myself long before I finally did.\n\nI know in this sub we are quick to say \"divorce\" \"red flag\" and such but PLEASE. Please get some counseling so that you can see the truth we see. This is unlikely to get better. You will lose yourself and be so dependent emotionally and monetarily that it will feel impossible to leave. I know it is hard. I know.\n\nSending you love.",

It is our PRIVATE residence.  \n\nMeanwhile, Your husband is literally expecting and accepting people to come over uninvited.  In his mind, your house is a shared/communal space.\n\nOP, you share most people\u2019s view that the home is your PRIVATE space, not that it is communal to those who reside outside the home.  You REALLY need to speak to your husband on boundaries and WHY you feel how you do.  I also second others on couples counseling because he is not considering your personal boundaries at all.",

    "postText": "My neighbour came over to my door this morning (7am) quite angry as after I went out for an early walk and some breakfast, I had parked in the street in a spot that he believes to be his to use as he usually parks there. It\u2019s a legal street parking space; just follows a time limit of 12 hours that you\u2019re allowed to be parked there which I am well under. I understand why he would like to park there, as it\u2019s the spot closest to both of our entrances. I chose to not answer the door as he was quite aggressively banging on it and wasn\u2019t particularly interested in dealing with that. He proceeded to shout in front of both houses a bunch of obscenities pertaining to me as well as many other things further confirming my decision to not engage. His point seems to revolve around it being a large vehicle that he often loads/unloads things from; but I don\u2019t really see how that matters much at the end of the day as I may have a smaller car but I also load/unload things and park on the same street.\n\nAm I the asshole for not moving my vehicle?",

Like, do you move the car while you are asleep?\n\nI don't understand all the rage related to a parking spot that's not really a parking spot anyway.  If he really needs a place to park, he should consider moving to a place that has adequate off-street parking.",

But , you do need to have a talk with this guy.  I'm just telling you from experience this will not go away as long as you continue to park in \"his\" spot.",

    "postText": "   I, 18f, recently went through a breakup a few months ago. The guy who I was dating was my first boyfriend and I fell in love with him, but he didn\u2019t feel the same, and he broke up with me. I took it pretty hard, and I\u2019m still not over it, but I do think I\u2019m getting better.\n     I have a small friend group of six girls, one of whom is my best friend and the rest are friends that I enjoy spending time with but aren\u2019t necessarily close to. About three weeks ago, they decided they were worried about me because I still wasn\u2019t over my ex and made a group chat where they expressed their concerns. After their discussion, they decided it would be best if they didn\u2019t engage when I talked about him.\n     Unbeknownst to me, they all, including my best friend, stuck with this decision. Because they all would shut me down when I tried to talk about my feelings, I got the sense that I annoyed them and stopped talking to them so that they wouldn\u2019t become more annoyed with me. This made me feel much worse, because along with losing my ex, I thought I had lost all of my friends too. Because I didn\u2019t know about their decision, I thought that they had all suddenly stopped liking me. \n    Yesterday I found out about the groupchat when another friend of mine, who isn\u2019t really involved in this group, saw my best friend open a message in the group chat where they were talking about it. I\u2019m not upset with them because I know they were trying to help, but I texted in the original group chat to let them know how I had been feeling. \n     I told them that I knew they were trying to help, but that it wasn\u2019t helpful because it made me feel like I was unloved and that I wasn\u2019t worth listening to. I also said that I wasn\u2019t really comfortable with them making big decisions like that without telling because of how largely it affects me. Because I didn\u2019t have a say, it made me feel like I was their pet, which especially bothers me because I\u2019ve had problems in the past with people treating me like I\u2019m stupid and clueless because I\u2019m very curious and ask a lot of questions. Also, because I wasn\u2019t really close with most of the group, I feel like they didn\u2019t have a right to make such a decision, especially because of how it affected me. I told them I understood their concern, but I\u2019d rather them talk to me about it than decide things behind my back. \n     When they replied, they were upset because \u201cthey were just trying to help\u201d and they felt like I didn\u2019t appreciate them as friends for trying to do so. One of the girls disregarded all of my logic, and said she would still continue to ignore me when I tried to confide in her. My best friend also said that by saying I felt like I wasn\u2019t that close with some of the girls in the group, I offended one of them. \n     I thought that my request was reasonable, but they\u2019re still upset with me, so I\u2019m not really sure if I should apologize, because they really were trying to help, and I shut them down. AITA?",

If they had then you would have known that you were overwhelming them with your emotions.    Now for your part, you absolutely can not constantly talk about your breakup and your sad feelings about it all the time, after the first shock of it.   You\u2019re not dealing with your feelings and you want to give those feelings to someone else so you don\u2019t feel so bad.   But this is hard on everyone else and feels heavy and gross after awhile.     Stop doing that to your friends.  If you need more, get therapy.  Your friends are not therapists and can\u2019t be expected to have limitless patience.    Start looking for things to feel good about, and talk about those things.   Changing your focus to what you actually have instead of what you don\u2019t have will do wonders.",

They have a right to choose whatever they want for their own boundaries (in this case the boundary of not being a sounding board for feelings about the break up). Would it have been kind of them to tell her instead of leaving her guessing? Yes absolutely, but expecting them to put up with ongoing trauma dumping from her is unfair too.",

And if I\u2019m honest I have been on the other side of this as well, because of ongoing abuse and PTSD, which I have gotten under control, but at the time I had no idea how my complaining was affecting everyone, but after awhile friends were suddenly unavailable to take my calls.    I still didn\u2019t get it until I decided to stop acting the victim, then I was like someone who just quit smoking lol, can\u2019t stand other people smoking right?  But I had a talk with my 2 friends and explained why I couldn\u2019t be the shoulder for them to cry on. I flat out requested that they not call me when they are actually crying, but that we can talk if they get it together and figure out what they want and we can talk about that.    They understood completely and our relationships are so much better.    So I would love to see OP not go down the rabbit hole and lose her friends.",

If they can\u2019t do you the courtesy of actually taking TO you about their concerns I\u2019d seriously question how much you need these friends in your life- if they don\u2019t have enough respect for you to actually talk to you, why waste your time on them? It is absolutely reasonable to ask friend NOT to gossip about you behind your back and give you the respect of actually having a conversation. If they didn\u2019t want to listen to you talk about your ex anymore, they could have easily said \u201chey, I understand you\u2019re upset, but maybe for today let\u2019s focus on something else and see how you feel tomorrow.\u201d  Getting over someone is a process- and yes, it can be rough to have to listen to someone else dissect it repeatedly, but instead of just shutting you out they could have tried a million other ways to support you and help you move on. Your friends sound pretty crummy if you ask me.",

Chicken flicks, chocolates and ice cream! - with close friends who don't feel entitled to gossip about you and the pain you're going through  :)",

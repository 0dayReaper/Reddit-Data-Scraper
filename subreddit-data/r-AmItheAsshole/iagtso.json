    "postText": "About a week ago, my (39F) family ordered Chinese food for delivery. When the delivery driver came to the door, my daughter (16F) was taking the cat upstairs to put in her room because he always tries to eat the food. My son (13M)  loudly says, \u201cMake sure the hide the cat from the Chinese guy!\u201d as I am at the door getting the food from the Chinese delivery driver. He very obviously heard what my son said and was upset by it. I quickly apologized and took the food. \n\nI told my son that racist jokes were completely unacceptable and very wrong and he refused to admit that he was in the wrong. So, later that night I forced my son to write a sincere apology to the delivery driver, (his name was on the receipt) as well as write a one page paper on Chinese culture and a one page paper on why racism is perpetuated by racist jokes and stereotypes. Then the next day I took him to the restaurant and had him read his apology aloud to the delivery driver as well as give him the papers he wrote. The driver was very appreciative of the apology and thanked me for making my son do it. He then told my son about multiple instances where he had faced racist comments and attacks from people while he was a delivery driver. \n\nThat night my husband (43M) and I got into an argument about me making our son do this. He told me that it was embarrassing for our son to have to do the apology and that the \u201cpunishment didn\u2019t fit the crime\u201d. I told him that it was much more embarrassing for the driver to have to face that kind of racism and racist stereotypes and that our son would get over the embarrassment. I do not condone any kind of hateful thinking in my house, and the fact that my son said that embarrassed me as well. My husband told me that it was \u201cjust a joke\u201d and it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. I feel like I might have over reacted some but I think it\u2019s important to help my son understand how what he said was wrong and hurtful.",

(Uh, I'm a girl and my parents didn't drown me.) But it left a lasting impression and often I wished I was white so I could be \"normal.\" But if we fight back, we're \"too sensitive.\" People would taunt me with ching chong and tell me to go back to \"where I came from\", but if I called them \"white people\" in the context of \"I'm tired of white people treating us like that\" it was \"whoa whoa whoa not ALL white people, stop stereotyping us!\" even if they JUST made the dog-eating joke.\n\nAnyway, NTA OP, thanks for teaching your kids to do better.",

Kids in school used to tell me they saw me eating snakes and dogs for dinner through our window (our family didn't eat by the window and we definitely didn't eat those things, needless to say). I didn't know it was wrong of them to say that and didn't know to stand up for myself. \n\nI'm an adult now and live in Australia. Making casual comments differentiating white people from people of color seems to be acceptable here. My MIL's early comments to me about black people in America (where I'm from) are one of the reasons I don't want her around my mixed race baby. She thinks it's okay because we're not black and \"Asian is close enough to white,\" but that's not a message I want to teach my daughter. \n\nI hear you on the frustration of dealing with white people being sensitive about being grouped in with other white people even while they themselves perpetuate racism. I stand up for myself now and people think I'm oversensitive and high strung while acting taken aback that they are being called white people. I don't care. \n\nSucks so much that the comments get more subtle but the message stays the same.",

Ultimately we have to deconstruct the way we default whiteness and white narratives. When TV and films only show white protagonists, when in American history books you predominantly learn about white historical figures, read literature from white writers and academics, we\u2019re still conditioned to internalize whiteness as normal and everyone else as abnormal. Even when I lived in diverse areas, I still unconsciously only drew white people and wrote white characters and looked up to white features (blond hair, blue eyes) as pretty and brown eyes and dark hair as ugly.\n\nI think normalizing PoC in media as protagonists and teaching their histories as prominently as white people\u2019s ultimately is what will help even the most homogenous populations, which is why I think it\u2019s smart that OP made her son do research (even though it would have been better to research Chinese diaspora history instead of just Chinese culture, if not both).",

Kudos to you for a very just and well thought out lesson for your son, which I hope he can truly learn from and perhaps help solve some of the issues that are breaking our society apart. \nPerhaps your husband needs to do some similar homework in r ed grads to what racism is and how it harms not simply the people it is directed at, but all people as a whole.\nHonestly,  I am so proud of you (in the most non-condesending way possible) for being such an excellent example of a person for your family.",

You ever notice how white people have \"just a joke\" for every race/ethnicity/religion on earth?  Because they've spent centuries trying to subjugate them in the name of wealth and power.  White privilege is having the ability to make those jokes every day without recrimination while the people that are subjected to them are further dehumanized and otherwise alienated.  He needs to understand it is not ok.  And he needs to understand that teaching his son that it's not ok is one of his greatest responsibilities as a parent.\n\nEdit: a word",

What he said was not funny, it was wildly inappropriate and also hurtful.\n\nThe reason his behavior is so wrong, is because that stereotype that Asians eat cats and dogs, comes from this nasty belief that all Asians are barbaric people. This prejudice dates really far back, and became even more prevalent during and following WWII. The fact that this prejudice still exists despite the American obsession with Japanese anime and K-Pop, says a lot, it really does. This is why education is so important, and that is exactly what you gave your son.\n\nEdit: Just because some poverty stricken cities in China consume cats and dogs, doesn't make the stereotype okay. The origins of that stereotype are from the U.S., not what happens in China. People were convinced that Chinese who operated take-out restaurants would steal their pets and eat them. This stereotype has been applied to ALL ASIANS, not just Chinese. And I promise you, most Asians would like you to STOP thinking they all steal pets, because they certainly do not.\n\nEdit #2: Thank you for the award kind person! You are awesome!\n\nEdit #3: Thank you for the Snek Award! Snakes are my fave animals :D",

My mom said this to a couple 12 year old honor students, in response to us getting caught shoplifting makeup. What can I say, 12 yr olds can be dumb about that kind of thing). My friend eventually forgave my mom while my mom pretends none of it ever happened.\n\nPoint is: whoever you try to ban will become their BFF even harder. Best you can do is supervise with this friend and keep the dialogue open with your kid about values, right and wrong, ask what your child really thinks and believes about the world around them, and hope either the friend outgrows the BS (like my bff and I did) or your kid outgrows the friend.",

Most states don\u2019t hold 13 year olds liable for crimes for a reason. Kids do stupid things. Your punishment did not fit the crime. It reminds me of the overboard punishments my religious fundamentalist friend\u2019s parents put him through for benign actions. None of the punishments ever worked, and instead of learning a lesson, my friend just got better at not getting caught. A more measured response would likely have been far more effective.",

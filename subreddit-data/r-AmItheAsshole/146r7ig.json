Football is incredibly tribal - your friend wound you up when his team won and you returned the favour - all is fair in love and war\n\nHowever, there is a difference between a few jokes between friends - which you acknowledge he took - and putting a photo on social media. Instead of laughing between you, you were now inviting a larger audience to laugh AT him\n\nYou probably took it too far in the moment, but you also deleted it, so he needs to get over it",

Most fans don't care as long as they are winning, but it's still a disgrace. I only root for clubs owned by shareholders/fans or local businesmen. Clubs like Newcastle, PSG and City are a plague. It bums me about City cause I used to love that club and visited Maine Road with my father in like 2001.",

Absolutely brilliant. Didn\u2019t travel to the game but watched in the local pub with friends and it was a great atmosphere. \n\nThere were some friends there who support the local rival team.  One friend particularly is fanatical about his team, goes to home and away games and (important) always used to give me grief when they won things.   We gave it back this time and there was a lot of banter.  They were not happy but sucked it up. \n\nSomeone photoshopped this friend\u2019s face onto one of our players in their kit holding the cup.  I posted it on social media. \n\nIt was not a good photoshop, it was obviously not really him.\n\nHe only realised when he started getting messages.  He got really annoyed and demanded I take it down.  I didn\u2019t immediately but I have now. \n\nHe\u2019s still complaining today.  Can he not take a joke or AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I just found out that my GPA is not as good as expected and that i most definitely wouldn't get accepted into my dream university.\n\nAs soon as i came home i just bawled my eyes out. My mom wanted to cheer me up so she planned this family dinner at a new place in town.\n\nMy sister (F14) was pissed about that, because that meant that she had to leave her best friend's house sooner than expected. As soon as we got to the location she started to complain and said that this place looked cheap. Then she began to ask every ten minutes when we would be leaving. \n\nWhen my grandma asked if i got the score i wanted i started to cry because my gran was the reason i chose a uni so close to home. That i probably lby hat to move away broke my heart. My sister hissed at me that i was embarrassing her and commanded me to stop. \n\nMy sister recently got nominated for an award for good behavior and empathy. So i told her how bad she made me feel tonight and that i won't go to her award ceremony since she refused to support me in such a situation where i needed her. She agreed and told me okay.\n\nBut now that i overthought it i think that i might overreacted a little bit. For me it was just a dinner but for her a whole award ceremony. She really hurt me but i also dont want to treat her unfair.",

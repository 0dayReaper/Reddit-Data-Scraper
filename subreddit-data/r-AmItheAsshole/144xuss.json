    "postText": "I (F27) have a seafood allergy, anything that comes from the sea will cause me to breakout in hives, nauseated and difficulty breathing, it never got to the point of being anaphylaxis reaction but i do not want to risk it. My husband (27M) loves seafood specifically lobster. he will eat it when visiting his parents (who lives 4h away) but never around me. His parents are coming to visit next week and are bringing lobster ( My MIL dosent understand my allergy and think i just get a small rash). I just found out today. I told my husband absolutely not, he can go to our friends house to eat it but not here. He told me how he will eat in the living room and i can stay in the bedroom, i said no the smell is going to linger and il be nauseated for hours. He promised to clean up after and scrub i said no i dont want to risk it. We argued a bit more and this is where we are. he is usually really good about my allergy and always check in restaurants before going there if they sell seafood and will warn the waiters about my allergy. this is completely out of character for him so im wondering if im being the AH here.\n\nEDIT: thanks everyone for the info! i had no idea i was already experiencing anaphylaxis. Its so scary how im not too far from anaphylaxis shock. Spoke to my husband again, and he read some comments. he apologized said it was so stupid of him thinking he could bring lobster here and clean up after. No lobster or any seafood will be coming into my house. They are going someplace else to eat it. Also for people worried, I do have an epipen and my husband is train on how to use it.",

I was just super careful with the cleanup.\n\nIn the other hand, she is also allergic to peanuts, but I adore peanut butter cups. They are my favourite chocolate. I eat those in the house, but not sitting next to her, I immediately wash my hands and mouth when I'm done, and don't kiss her until I've brushed my teeth. Also, no touching of communal surfaces (the remote is a big one!) Until hand washing has happened. It is a bit of a pain in the ass, but I don't want her to die. \n\nWe've been together for 18 years, and married for 13, and I have never had to use her epi pen or take her to the hospital. I don't want to ever have to deal with that, after hearing her family stories, I am willing to put up with some annoyance around what  I eat at home.\n\n(my SIL I had to use an epi pen on my BIL, who has similar allergies to my wife, but SIL managed to jab herself in the hand instead, so both of them had to go to the hospital in a foreign country where they didn't speak the language.)",

So they don't go out to restaurants because no matter how careful the kitchen is, she can't risk it; and they don't have those things at home. It makes their regular eating a bit repetitive, but they have a number of dishes that they really like worked out, so they don't mind repeating those, and my father has learned how to cook safely for her. \n\nIt's just a part of living with and loving somebody with chronic health issues. I have severe fibromyalgia, and my husband has gotten used to being the one who gets up to go to the kitchen or turn out the lights most of the time, because that's an effort of movement that is better if I save for things I really need to get done. \n\nSo he takes the small stuff. Again, just a part of living with and loving someone with chronic health issues. A good partner gets used to it... and it looks like this guy *did* get used to it, until his mother got involved and he didn't want to disappoint her. That's the issue here, I think, not the lobster per se. I doubt this guy cares about the lobster half as much as he cares about not having to fight with his mom. (And no, this is no excuse; but it may be an explanation that can help them talk about it.)",

Even having hot chips cooked in the same basket as fish will usually mean a trip to the hospital. WE DONT EVEN BUY SHELLFISH when we are going to his place or he is coming to ours. We let him organise the prawns for BBQ and Xmas (Aussie) so because he knows where to buy safely for him and calls the store ahead so they can keep his \"safe\" from contamination (they know him, perks of living in a small town for 20+years and working in the industry).\n\nYou don't mess with other people's allergies. You let them handle any potential risks, and YOU DONT NOT BRING THOSE TRIGGERS INTO THEIR HOME. Yes, it's OPs hubby's house too, but HEALTH TRUMPS \"CRAVING\" (or whatever his excuse is).\n\nETA me \"sucking it up\" was my own choice. Hubby never asked it was always my way of saying thank you for going without one of his favourite dishes",

We do not eat her allergens in front of her. \n\nIt is shocking to me that OP\u2019s husband would be willing to take such a huge risk by contaminating their shared home with her allergen. If the lobster is cooked at their home, their pots and pans, plates, utensils and cooking surfaces will all need to be sanitized. Even surfaces you wouldn\u2019t expect like the trash can may have shellfish residue present and if she is sensitive to contact, that could trigger a reaction. \n\nAnd you hit the nail on the head. A previous reaction does not necessarily predict the severity of the next reaction. Previous exposures may not have triggered anaphylaxis, but that doesn\u2019t mean the next one won\u2019t. It is not worth the risk. \n\nI really hope OP\u2019s husband grows a spine and tells his parents to leave the lobster at home. This is divorce-worthy to me if he continues to force the issue.",

One surface not quite as sterilized as they thought. It simply is not safe to cook and eat a food item someone has a serious enough allergy to that it gives them hives, nausea and breathing issues in their own home. This is a hill you need to die on (preferably not literally). They can go out and have an outdoor picnic or go cook and eat it at a friend\u2019s house.\n\nThe aerosolized proteins from cooking and eating seafood can stay in the air too, not just on hands/surfaces and can trigger reactions in people who have severe allergies even if all surfaces are cleaned and everyone showers/changes clothes after. I have to choose which restaurants I visit *very* carefully due to that.

While you\u2019re there, think about how your husband is remarkably cavalier about your continued access to, you know, breathing.\n\nEdit 2 (the revenge of edit) you say that you\u2019ve had a rash, nausea and difficulty breathing but not full anaphylaxis- not to be snide or anything, but what exactly do you think anaphylaxis is? What you\u2019ve listed are literal symptoms of anaphylaxis.\n\nSo maybe you just got a mild case - but every allergic reaction can be different.

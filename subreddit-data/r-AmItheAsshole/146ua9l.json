I (19F) and my ex (18M) was dating for 2 years before we broke up around March, while I was in the relationship his mom was pretty weird when it came to me. She would smile and laugh with me telling me that she liked me then talked to my mother saying that she could get my ex with anyone else or she would compare me to other girls that were friends of my ex that she wished I was more like ect but that\u2019s not why I posted the tiktoks. My breaking point when it came to her was when we broke up and she was nothing but disrespectful towards me and it got to the point where I was hearing things that she was saying about me through my coworkers. Not only I was upset that she was saying bad things about me behind my back but I was upset that my coworkers knew my business from my ex himself to the point that my general manager knew everything.  Now should I have leaked what she did online because she was telling people my business? I still don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s why I took it down. I left out a lot of what was said for the sake of both parties but if you need more details just comment.",

Unfortunately this is how some people are and force you to live life with a scale in one hand, weighing options and deciding if a relationship is worth it. At least your relationship with her son is off the table so that gives you free reign to say what you want without recourse from her son.",

I was the fuck up son, flipping pounds before I got serious and started my IT/software developer career.\n\nI cried at his last breath, but he made me promise to not cry at his funeral and that was REALLY hard for me to do. I chocked and had to just leave the room so I could live up to that promise.\n\nBefore I went back to school, got CCNA certified, I worked mountain safety and ski patrol, and with his military background he got put into those programs. It was a retirement job but we got to work side by side. I remember him asking me \"If my call sign comes over the radio, will you be there?\" I promised him I would and I lived up to that. There was one day that he responded to a tree strike and called it in. I laid out tracks from the top of Nevada side to the California side in about 45 seconds flat. Our supervisor did the math later and was like \"You had to be doing 65+ to make it in that time.\"\n\nI was like \"Yeah, I got the job done. My father called in for help. You want to fire me? Fire me.\"\n\nMy father and I started bonding after we cracked a beer after our shift was over.",

Too often, therapy is thought of as going to the emergency room, when it can easily be used as preventative medicine (sorry for the shit analogy). It's even possible to start the first few sessions as a family... although this obviously depends entirely on Josh and what will make him feel most comfortable. I know it's not the same example, but my dad was extremely critical of therapy, until the entire family had a few sessions together, and to all of our complete surprise he started going to sessions on his own, without prompting. Sometimes having family with you can ease anxieties.",

I continuously offered him to go out to the park and play a bit of football (he loves that) and all his favourite things, but he just outright declined and even got a little angry sometimes for me even talking to him. I thought I messed up big-time, until one day while my wife and two children were out doing shopping and we were alone, he came up to me and said \"I know you're not my real father, but I want to let you know you're the best dad in the whole world. Sorry for before.\" I hugged him and things got pretty emotional. It would be a big lie to say my house is normal now (far from that), but things are slowly - ever so slowly - starting to brighten up. There's no longer anything to hide anymore and it feels like we are born again. \n\nI think all parents struggle with questioning if the decisions they're making for their kids are the right ones. But I also know that stepparents, adoptive parents and family who step in to become parents struggle with that doubt a little bit more than the others do. So, I want to tell you from a family therapist's perspective that you handled this *exactly* right! I mean, you really could not have done that any better, Dad. You gave him the space he needed to process his feelings in his own manner *and* you made sure to stress that him doing so was okay. You allowed him to test the limits and to see if you meant it when you said nothing could make you love him less. It's so sad that your parents weren't interested in a relationship with this young man, but he sure did lucky to have a brother and father who loves him as much as you do. &lt;3",

Even though he is your brother? If he wants? That way, the biological relationship might have changed, but he would still be your son and you would be his father in all the other ways. His mother would still be his, if that's their relationship and he would know it was a wanted one and not because she was with his brother/father. There would be legal, social etc backing to frame the relationship the way he wants and can explain to himself, others and for your other two children who had a brother and now have an uncle. Securing that sense of safety and 'ownership' of the names of your relationships to each other could be important in keeping the ground steady under all your feet. \n\nJust a thought.

In your story, he has had 12 years of love and support and family, and now instead of the emotional pain from childhood, he can face this new knowledge and integrate it without a serious amount of trauma (I hope). You have done right by Josh. \n\nQuestion though, and I apologize if you've answered already, as I haven't read every single comment. Are you still in contact with your parents? Does Josh know them as his grandparents? If not, I don't see why your relationship has to change at all. Tell your meddling aunts and uncles that Josh is aware and as far as you both are concerned they can butt out. If they must judge anyone, talk to their siblings who abandoned a baby with their barely 20 year old son to raise.",

She wanted me to have two parents and people who could take care of her so she gave me to my grandparents and she became my \u201csister\u201d. \n\nNow I found out when I was really young, about 5,  that my parents were my grandparents and my sister my mom but that was because people who knew were taking it upon themselves to say things in front of me. So they sat me down explained things or at least tried to in a way a 5 yr old could understand and I was just kinda like meh. \n\nMy grandparents stayed mom and dad, and my mom stayed my sister. Things got a little more complicated when she had two more kids and eventually told them that I was really their sister not their aunt. They were ecstatic to have an older sister and from then on refused to call me their aunt. \n\nThat was fine until I moved states and now I\u2019m right across the street from my sisters house. So here it\u2019s easier to call her mom cause if my siblings introduced me as my sister and then I call their mom my sister I get weird looks lol. \n\nGot even more crazy when I finally met my real dad. (His wife is amazing and totally accepts me) Now I just say I have 3 moms and 3 dads. Father\u2019s Day and Mother\u2019s Day is expensive lol\n\nThe relationship I have with my mom/sister is most definitely hard to describe because she falls into both catagories. But mom and sad are always mom and dad. \n\nHope I explained that well lol it\u2019s kinda hard to explain on paper but for some reason going through life it just works. It\u2019s slightly more complicated than what this situation is but weird family dynamics are out there",

My husband found out at age nine that his 'mom' was actually his grandmother and his 'sister' was his mom.\n\nIt still bothers him to this day.  He knows that he had a much better life with grandma than he ever would have with his bio mom.  She had him at a very young age, 13 or 14.  She ended up with a total of 4 kids before she was 20, but he was the only one she gave up.  His siblings all have issues, in and out of jail constantly,  you can see they were not raised well and had a hard life.  \n\nUnfortunately  for him its just something he has never fully been able to get past.",

But he's old enough to see the good life you've selflessly given him. I think you guys will be fine as some time passes and things settle down a bit.\n\nI have no extra advice to give. Just praise for what you and your wife have done for him.",

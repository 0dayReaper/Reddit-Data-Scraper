    "postText": "(I\u2019ve never used Reddit before so I\u2019m not sure how this works)\nI F19, am upset at my bf, M19, because he will not get a free to play game to play with me. \n\nI know this may sound stupid but I feel kind of hurt that he won\u2019t get the game because I only ever really got into gaming because I wanted to spend time with him and have now invested a bunch of money into gaming and purchasing games + PC upgrades to play with him\u2026 including lots of expensive games that I really honestly had no prior interest in purely so I could play with him.  \n\nOf course, while playing with him I enjoyed them and actually outskilled him in a couple of the games we played together; eventually, he stopped playing most games because he got busy w/work and only plays a few games now.  I recently found a game that I really enjoy playing, (the game isn\u2019t really relevant but it\u2019s a PvP game that\u2019s just in the fantasy genre) and I lightheartedly brought it up to him and I asked him if he would like to play it with me.  He immediately refused, I tried to ask why but I was met with hostility regarding that it\u2019s \u201cjust not the kind of game he would play.\u201d  I tried to tell him that I was never interested in any of the games that he played but I still got them so that we can spend time together and he got upset and told me that it\u2019s \u201cmy fault for getting them to play with him\u201d and I asked him to sacrifice nothing to play a free game with me and spend some time with me and he got mad and left\u2026 \n\nAbout 10 mins later- he texted me from wherever he went, angrily trying to continue the fight saying he wouldn\u2019t enjoy it and it\u2019s not the game he\u2019d play and he has no interest in fantasy games (even though it\u2019s literally the same kind of PvP as COD and has similar objectives) and eventually said \u201cFine.  What\u2019s the name.\u201d And then \u201cK.\u201d after I told him\u2026AITA???  I really do not understand why he made a big deal out of it.\n\nMore context? We have recently had a few fights, but nothing too serious and have been keeping my friends updated on everything and they are saying I\u2019m not TA but I feel like an unbiased opinion would be better.  Thank you!\n\n\nUPDATE: He messaged me a few hours later saying that he was sorry for giving me such a hard time and he had no idea why he even argued with me and that he was just in a sour mood.  He came back a little after and apologized again, still have no idea where he went but I guess all is well?  Didn\u2019t ask him if this meant he would try the game though\u2026 I guess I will update if we end up playing the game if anyone is interested(?)",

If he didn\u2019t want to play with me that\u2019s totally fine, the only problem is it is the kind of game he would enjoy and I know that, he just automatically said he wouldn\u2019t enjoy it which really confused me because he loves FPS fast paced games. :(  I don\u2019t know why he would dislike playing with me either since he is always the one asking me to play some games with him when he gets off work, maybe he had a bad day or something.

He got me into FPS/ military games and they are his favorite, especially old COD\u2019s and this game is kind of similar in the way that it\u2019s a shooter it just has dragons and some fantasy stuff.

It financially cost him nothing and would give him relationship gains. You\u2019re happy and spending time together. I think his reaction was outlandish. Y\u2019all are young so I\u2019ll give him the benefit of the doubt, but relationships are give and take. Though you may not be interested in an activity but your partner is, it makes sense to at least give it a try. He doesn\u2019t have to play with you to completion and doesn\u2019t have to play a similar game ever again. As a gamer myself, there were two games I thought I\u2019d hate, played for about 15 minutes and realized I actually really liked it!",

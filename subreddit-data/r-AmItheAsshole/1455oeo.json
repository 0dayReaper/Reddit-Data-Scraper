    "postText": "We have a chore chart, my three children have to 4 chores a day, they aren\u2019t hard, like make you bed or sweep you carpet. If you get too them when you get home it takes usually 20 minutes in all. Every kid has different chores depending on age, can\u2019t have the 7 year old take the kitchen trash out. It works really well overall and they can see there four chores each day for the month.\n\nMy son has been pawing of his chores to his youngest sister 12. So she basically has been doing 8 chores a day. My daughter came to me upset not understanding why I was giving his chores to her. I wasn\u2019t she was lied to by him and since they usually do them when I am at work I didn\u2019t notice.\n\nSo as a punishment since he had her due his chores for about a little over a month (36 days) He has to do 300 chores on top of his chores already. Since that basically the amount she has been doing for the time that month. He was not happy but really if he just does a  ton of cleaning on the weekend it won\u2019t be that horrible, and some chores overlap.\n\nMy husband hear about it and claims I am going overboard. That it is an upsetting amount. He tried to retract the punishment but I put my foot down. AITA is this too much\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSince people asked, my daughter has the choice of take 36 days off or get extra allowance for the work she did. She hasn\u2019t chosen yet\n\nA little confusion, he is still doing daily chores but they will overlap with the 300 chore list. So you do a task it is marked off both lists. This will make him do at least 4 chores a day. Overall it will still be a total of 300 chores. Sorry for the confusion",

You don't have to go that far, but he is getting off light if you just give him the same number that his sister had to do.",

Your husband is counting the chores in a very weird way...it's particularly odd that he would count your son's extra chores like that but apparently is counting your daughter's extra chores in the normal way. You probably should look into whether he shows favoritism to your son in other ways, because if so, you have a bigger problem on your hands.",

Obviously, your kids consider it punishing enough that 1) your son would find a way to pawn it off and 2) your daughter would be hurt by the \\[increased\\] workload. This is further evidenced by the fact that even your husband agrees the Puritan Chore Checklist has gone too far.\n\nHow about just letting them be kids? Life is shitty enough as a adult, you dont need to take away their childhood too.\n\nThat 20 minutes could be better spent doing something enriching for their lives long term, rather than sweeping because your too cheap to get a roomba.\n\n**And for the downvoters- from RULE 2, \"DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH.

If you dont make his punishment fair (i.e. reflective of how much he took advantage of the daughter) then BOTH children will learn a harmful lesson.\n\nYour son will learn that the consequences dont outweigh bad behavior.\n\nYour daughter will learn that she can be mistreated and the person who did it will get off easy.\n\nRemember: Punishments are SUPPOSED TO BE UPSETTING.

If you get too them when you get home it takes usually 20 minutes in all. Every kid has different chores depending on age, can\u2019t have the 7 year old take the kitchen trash out. It works really well overall and they can see there four chores each day for the month.\n\nMy son has been pawing of his chores to his youngest sister 12. So she basically has been doing 8 chores a day. My daughter came to me upset not understanding why I was giving his chores to her. I wasn\u2019t she was lied to by him and since they usually do them when I am at work I didn\u2019t notice.\n\nSo as a punishment since he had her due his chores for about a little over a month (36 days) He has to do 300 chores on top of his chores already. Since that basically the amount she has been doing for the time that month. He was not happy but really if he just does a  ton of cleaning on the weekend it won\u2019t be that horrible, and some chores overlap.\n\nMy husband hear about it and claims I am going overboard. That it is an upsetting amount. He tried to retract the punishment but I put my foot down. AITA is this too kich\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

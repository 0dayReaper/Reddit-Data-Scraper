It feels as though whenever I approach them excited about something they deliberately act indifferent. Not feel totally indifferent, otherwise they simply wouldn't say anything. They obviously care enough to respond, though they completely imbue their tone of voice with this \"I don't care brroooo...\" thing to make them sound just like 'above everything' or whatever in some stupid stoner or whatever fantasy of being like apathetic and impressing everyone else at how detached you are...\n\nIt COMES ACROSS AS (not IS for certain...) they enjoy acting indifferent as an emotional defense mechanism to shield themselves from the mockery of other men. They clearly (probably, knowing their past...) never got over trying to impress the other guys as a totally pathetic adolescent really\n\nOccasionally he'll want me to be excited about something, so he clearly wants a regular friendship sometimes, where someone is happy and encouraging and not embarrassed by one's enthusiasm, though I think (whether he realizes it or not) he likes to employ a double-standard as a weird power thing, he's weird like that sometimes (his mother was/is very mentally ill, I suspect he inherited some neuroses, his brothers have shared/warned me about this before...).  \n\nSometimes he is a truly lovely guy and nice friend, great to hang out with, but he treats rather ordinary acts of interaction to be major violations of some social code only he knows about.   \nOne time he didn't inform me that his brother (a good friend of mine also, and our often better relationship has made me put this one in perspective, frankly...) was bringing his new gf around when visiting. I was thrown off a bit upon their arrival and so had to readjust what I might talk to him, the visiting brother, about without excluding his SO or whatever, and S (my roommate) was clearly acting pissy at me for what he perceived as me poorly handling the situation (he often insists I did something wrong socially, later, when no one else at the instance, and I do ask, claims that I did...) despite him not making any effort to make conversation with either of them, I'm not sure why...\n\nI think I answered my own question, but like, I genuinely could be wrong, I've made mistakes in the past, the guy claims that living me with is draining, but I only just try to act enthusiastic sometimes to cheer myself up and I think he feels embarrassed that one of his former bullies will come in and ridicule him or something, I don't know man...\n\nPutting it in words, man, my friend needs help...\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

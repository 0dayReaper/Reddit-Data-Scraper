I, (20M) work at a small regional pizza place as a cashier.

So I did. \n\nAlmost immediately after she had closed her mouth again, I shot back with a \u201cno ma\u2019am, but are you sure that you can?\u201d\n\nThe main issue I think is that I\u2019m white, so I understand that it sounds bad without context. \n\nBut given that she asked me the same thing first, AITA?",

If you clarified to her that you were asking about the pizza topings and such, it sound like either she was not understanding due to a language barrier, or she was just being rude.\n\nThough my suggestion is that if anything like that happens again, instead of snapping back, u just give a polite smile and and go malicious compliance. She wants a small pizza? Okay, give her a small pizza wthout any toppings and if she complains you just throw on her face that you did exactly what she asked.\n\nSome people are just condescending.",

So, ESH. No one did anything horribly wrong, and no one did anything right haha",

You should have asked,  if she wanted just cheese, or peperoni, or point to a picture with toppings, because it was obvious when you were saying what kind, she was still thinking of size as the kind of pizza and she probably assumed there is a default topping on the pizza and you were insulting her. Take it as a learning experience and the fact you feel guilty for such a small thing shows you do have a good heart.",

    "postText": "30th birthday is coming up in a few months. Parents live 4hrs away (moved away by choice) and have small anxious dog that can\u2019t be left alone. Dad works shift work (week on week off style). In the last 7 years they have come to visit me in our home city once, every other time I have visited them.\n\nGiven my birthday is coming up and I have a long term partner who I would like them to meet parents of, I suggested a family birthday dinner/lunch to bring the families together. Also so they could see where I lived etc. So far my dad has been nothing but difficult and I\u2019ve done nothing but try to appease them including:\n\n- finding pet friendly accom for them that was budget and reasonable. They said it was too expensive and complained about having to pay an additional $10 per day for parking\n\n- agreeing to have a lunch instead 1hr away to meet them in the middle of locations. So we would all need to drive to meet them still. They wanted a picnic with table chairs and seafood. I said I don\u2019t eat seafood (I was allergic as a kid) and suggested a dog friendly casual cafe in that area. Dad then said he felt that would be too much for the dog and also that it would not feel \u201crelaxed enough\u201d and \u201crushed to eat food and leave.\u201d I reinforced this is highly unlikely.\n\nAt this point he ended it with \u201cwell it\u2019s too hard to come down with the dog and I\u2019ll be too tired from the drive to go back to work might just have to see you later\u201d you could tell he was pissed I just didn\u2019t agree to their exact suggestion.\n\nMy mum in a separate conversation has said I needed to think about my \u201ctone\u201d and \u201cconvince him\u201d as \u201cwe know how he is\u201d..a stubborn recluse at this point. My thoughts are that if you don\u2019t want to attend and have an attitude to make it work..well I can\u2019t do much more compromising if I\u2019m already meeting you an hour away and can\u2019t even pick a food option\n\nDad reached out with a text and said sorry I\u2019m not good at this it\u2019s just too much of an ordeal for him. I\u2019m planning on letting it sit for a while but I just think it\u2019s poor form they\u2019re not more apologetic and it\u2019s come back on my attitude as if I\u2019m not allowed to show some upset. I think they could make it work but are so negative.\n\nTLDR: parents veto any birthday plans due to living 4hrs away and separation anxiety dog. Dog friendly cafe too stressful. Feel like never inviting them again or visiting them for a while",

            "comment": "NTA.\n\nAnxious dog aside, 4-hour distance aside, it all comes down to this: *your dad does not want to be away from home.* I don't know whether his problem is with your city, or socializing in general, or whether he has become agoraphobic in his later years, but that's what it boils down to.\n\nAll the excuses he gives, you can demolish one by one, and he will simply come up with another. He does not want to visit you.\n\nYou can save yourself a lot of heartbreak if you just accept the fact that you cannot change him. Maybe that means having every meaningful celebration in their town from now on. Maybe it means planning all your celebrations in your city, without him. Maybe a bit of both. What you do is up to you. But if your plans ever involve him going any distance from his home, you are setting yourself up for disappointment, time after time.\n\nAn aside, that may be relevant: A family member of mine became severely and uncharacteristically agoraphobic in the two or three years before they died. Like your dad, they did not want to venture too far from home. Whenever we drove them somewhere, they'd regularly start panicking and yell out \"Stop the car! I can't breathe!\", and they'd have to get out of the car and sit by the roadside and breathe and try to calm down. We were baffled, and thought it was just panic attacks. (I'd never heard of panic attacks starting so late in life, but hey, anything's possible.) Then not long before they died (of other causes), we learned what was going on: they had Parkinson's. Some forms of Parkinson's can cause severe anxiety and panic attacks like this. So maybe your dad could do with a full medical assessment to rule out something serious like that. If he'll agree to it - which he may not.",

I do think there could be some mental illness and anxiety that has built over the decades for him but sadly I doubt it would ever be admitted. He works mining interstate so flys across country every few week and has to undergo medicals but idk if it would flag this. He did not have a close relationship with his father due to alcoholism and abuse so I think \u201cevery man is an island\u201d is a bit hard wired, sadly moving 4hrs away just has increased that.",

I took your mum's term \"stubborn recluse\" to mean he doesn't venture away from home often.\n\nIf he regularly flies interstate for work, then the problem isn't that he *can't* go too far from home, it's that he doesn't want to.\n\nMaybe it's something about you, or your partner/friends, or the city you live in, or maybe he's an introvert who can handle work OK but does not like socializing.\n\nWhatever the reason, the point stands: **you won't change him.** Any significant change, he'll have to initiate himself. If he wants to be reclusive, let him. Live your life around that, without expecting him to change or making significant concessions to it. \"Dad, this is what we've planned for my birthday next month. We'd love it if you and Mum can come and stay the night, but we'll understand if you can't.\"",

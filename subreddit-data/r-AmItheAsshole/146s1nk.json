Your are grown adults buying a house with your own money and whilst you can be open to their advice and suggestions, you are absolutely not beholden to give them a veto on what you and your partner decide.\n\nIf they can't accept that, then it's on them. They are infantilising you and it needs to stop.\n\nIt's hard learning to be assertive with one's parents, especially ones as forceful as yours who resort to emotional blackmail to get their way.\n\nBut it will be better for your future if you can do so.\n\nNTA",

For some background my partner 30m and I 28f have been house hunting for a while. We have involved both our parents throughout this process and were happy to do so. We had put an offer in for a property (with approval from both sides) and had the offer accepted. We had 3 days to pay the deposit. Since both our parents hadn't actually had a look at the property we had another look on the day I was suppose to pay the deposit. Initially everything was fine but that night my parents called me basically pointing out all the issues with the house and suggested that we rethink seriously and should let the house go. I had a chat with my partner and we decided to take the risk and pay the deposit. \n\nThe next morning when my mother asked about it I said we have payed the deposit and would like them to respect out decisions. However I then got a phone call from my very angry mother who couldn't believe I payed the deposit depite what they said and how strongly they don't like the house. She said my father couldn't sleep that night and I'm responsible. Long story short I ended up caving and then had to try pull out of the contract which could have cost us the deposit and got us sued. (Was fine in the end)\n\nI was angry and didn't call them for about two week (usually we are close and call a lot) and we looked at another property which both my partner and I liked a lot. So we decided to put an offer in. I called my mum to let her know before we did that but my father wanted to inspect. At this point I was angry as I felt that given that happen I didn't really want their involvement anymore ( I worried about what would happen if they didn't like this property either) so I texted my mum saying that I would prefer it if they are not involved as my partner is also purchasing and I need to look after his feelings. She got so angry with that, accusing me of not caring about their feelings and that I was a desappointment, that I was stupid and I could have smoothed things out. I haven't talked to her since for about a month and got a call from my father today demanding that I need to physically visit her and apologse because she crys whenever she thinks about this. \n\nOn one hand I feel bad and don't want my mother to be crying and I feel shitty cause I love her. On the other hand I'm mad as I felt disrespected and I had no say in a property that my partner and I are going to fully pay for. My partner has been very understanding but I feel like if we switched placed I would be angry (he is paying 30 percent of the property)\n\nAm I the asshole? How should I resolve this? This fight is wearing me down and my fear is that if I cave then the same thing will happen again in the future (could be about another house or kids etc)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

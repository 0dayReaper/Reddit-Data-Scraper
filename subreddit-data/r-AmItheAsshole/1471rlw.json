I say this more for your sanity than his. Do nice things because you want to, not because you\u2019re obligated. If it doesn\u2019t feel nice to do, don\u2019t do it\u2026family/parent/friend doesn\u2019t change that.",

Based on your description, he is still what most people would think of as a terrible father - he is just better than when you were a child - especially since children have more of a need for a real parent.\n\nIn terms of paying for a share of your father's meal, personally I would not go because either alternative isn't great for your mental health - You can go and pay and feel like a victim or you can not pay which is going to create issues with your sister because it is the norm to pay for a meal on Father's Day.\n\nDon't go and don't create a no win situation. Send him an email on the day - costs nothing.",

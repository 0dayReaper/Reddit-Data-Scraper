Me male (26) and my girlfriend (29) female live in the suburbs of our town. Our current landlord refuses to fix some crucial things that are missing in my current apartment like doors cabinet doors and small little things. The rent in our current home is expensive but we can still manage to save a little bit. We have decided that we had enough of this with our landlord and started looking elsewhere. Today we found a 3 bedroom apartment in the center of the town for a bit more money. We went to check out the place and we fell in love with the place it was really amazing. After that I started making some basic equations to see if we could really afford that place and for my calculations at the time I thought o could afford it. We went all day mega happy and had a mega time. At the evening the landlord of the home we had seen today called us and said that we had been chosen for de apartment. We went crazy we where really happy and then after dinner i decided to make the calculations again to see if everything was in order. Checks out it wasn\u2019t. I forgot a important bill we have to pay each month and with that we could barely afford it. My girlfriend went nuts with me and said that\u2019s is my fault everything because I made her imagine herself in that place. I really don\u2019t have the intention to do something like that to her. It was a mistake on my part and I admitted it. She still don\u2019t want to talk to me and locked herself in the room crying. So Reddit am I the Asshole?",

She's not just there to pick places and be happy. You admitted your mistake. She's being juvenile and crying over a very trivial issue. It's a bummer, but you still have a place to live.",

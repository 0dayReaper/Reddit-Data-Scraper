    "postText": "I (17F) have been inseparable friends with Eva ever since 5th grade, and have known her for even longer. Although she is a good person and a supportive friend, she has always been kind of rude, which, in the past, I shrugged off as \"just her way of being\" and a teenager's demeanor.\n\nHowever, things have gotten out of hand after Eva's 17th birthday party, to which she invited many of her friends, of course. As an autistic, depressed and formerly bullied person, I felt very overwhelmed by those strangers and decided to keep my contact with people at a courtesy level, isolating myself from the bunch. I really just showed up because it was important to Eva. After the event, she cussed me out through messages, calling me an asshole and a toxic friend, as well as saying I was faking my mental illnesses and didn't give a shit about her. Eva even told me people were shit-talking me after I left the party and she agreed with them on everything. I was deeply hurt, but apologized to her regardless. Things seemed to have grown quieter between us. However, after that, Eva started replying rudely to every single thing I said and taking everything in an offensive tone. I have never been the type to call people out, so, of course, I still said nothing even though she was so deeply hurtful. \n\nToday, she called my family \"a bunch of pigs\". I was deeply offended and, for the first time, I texted Eva calling her out on her bullshit, to which she replied sarcastically. I feel like I shouldn't be friends with her anymore. My (two) other friends have already told me to drop her, but I can't cut her off from my life when she is one of my only pals and has been such an integral part of my experiences. As my 18th birthday approaches, I really can't think of it being a nice experience if she's there, specially since I told my family everything she's been doing to me.\n\nWould I be the asshole for not inviting her?",

There are times as you grow up where it becomes clear that friends should become former friends - they were there for a certain part of your life - but they have grown apart or you have grown apart from them.  Sounds like this friendship is done.  You deserve better - so invite people who aren\u2019t going to call your family names or judge you for taking care of your needs.",

Have you heard of a thing called Clearing Clutter For Clarity? It\u2019s when someone starts going through all their household junk and getting rid of what they aren\u2019t using, doesn\u2019t work , isn\u2019t needed.  The emotional effect is clarity about oneself and a sense of release.   This creates space in the home for new things.   It works in all areas of life.   The space in your life for a best friend has been cluttered with someone who has become useless in your life.  Let her go, creating an open space for something better and new. Unlike when you were a child you now have an idea of what constitutes a great friend, focus on that.",

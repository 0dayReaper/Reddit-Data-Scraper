    "postText": "English is not my native language so I miss the vocabulary about assembling furniture, but I (F25) moved in with my boyfriend and am building ikea furniture.\n\nOne thing I assambles was a wardrobe together with my bf. After I was done with my steps (one of us held a part, the other turned the screws) he insisted on checking the screws I put in and fasten each one again \"just to be sure\".\nTwo out of 6 screws in and there was nothing to turn, they were completely screwed in, solid in place. I told him its fine and that I did my best with each screw, but he checkef them all, claiming he was able to move some a teeny tiny bit more.\n\nI felt bad about this. Ofc looking into it is important, I dont want my furniture to fall into pieces. But I just felt like he didn't trust me enough and I told him that. I tried to voice my feelings as clear as possible, but he brushed it of, always coming back to \"you want this to hold, right?\"\n\nToday another package came, 4 dining room chairs. I assambled one, sat on it, no sqeeking, no wobbly legs and I am so proud of myself! I always was told to wait for other people to do these things because I am not strong enough.\n\nMy boyfriend is out for another hour in which I might finish the chairs completely and I think of telling him straight up to not look at any screws, just to sit down and to leave the chairs like they are, as a sign of his trust in my skills.\n\nWIBTA to ask this?",

He likes not having to think about how the furniture went together, and I like knowing that that it\u2019s as solid as possible. \n\nEnjoy your accomplishment.  He\u2019s not doubting you (unless he said that, but that not what it sounds like).  Him turning a screw doesn\u2019t make it any less your accomplishment.",

After I was done with my steps (one of us held a part, the other turned the screws) he insisted on checking the screws I put in and fasten each one again \"just to be sure\".\nTwo out of 6 screws in and there was nothing to turn, they were completely screwed in, solid in place. I told him its fine and that I did my best with each screw, but he checkef them all, claiming he was able to move some a teeny tiny bit more.\n\nI felt bad about this. Ofc looking into it is important, I dont want my furniture to fall into pieces. But I just felt like he didn't trust me enough and I told him that. I tried to voice my feelings as clear as possible, but he brushed it of, always coming back to \"you want this to hold, right?\"\n\nToday another package came, 4 dining room chairs. I assambled one, sat on it, no sqeeking, no wobbly legs and I am so proud of myself! I always was told to wait for other people to do these things because I am not strong enough.\n\nMy boyfriend is out for another hour in which I might finish the chairs completely and I think of telling him straight up to not look at any screws, just to sit down and to leave the chairs like they are, as a sign of his trust in my skills.\n\nWIBTA to ask this?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You don't even trust yourself, so to ask someone to not verify your own work you don't trust is unreasonable.\n\nShould he not check his car wheels lug nuts, not check his roller coasters seat belt, not confirm his employer direct deposited his paycheck? He wouldn't want to undermine the skills of his work's payroll person and hurt feelings, he just needs to implicitly trust and not verify these things.\n\nIt's an unreasonable ask.",

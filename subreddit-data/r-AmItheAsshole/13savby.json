She's admitting she's ruining *your* vacation so as not to ruin her own! They're *her* kids and *her* responsibility. \n\nNTA. In fact, you're nicer than *I* would be; I'd just say \"no thanks; I've got other plans\" and avoid the family vacation altogether.",

There's shit healthcare, expensive rentals, homelessness, alcohol and drug addiction, few services for parents of adult dependents, low wages, long hours, few vacations, inflation, climate change, failing reproductive rights, poor infrastructure, you need a car to get anywhere, etc. It's so much. \n\nA few years ago I started humoring those people, so whenever they ask when I'm starting a family I fake a small amount of excitement and optimism, like \"yeah I can't wait to have a little one of my own\" but then I go home and take every precaution. That's because they take it so personal and are disgusting in their attitudes towards child free people: judgmental, condescending, invasive of privacy, giving unsolicited advice, making demands, name calling and even accusations of Satanism and devil worship. All from the same kind of people who would vote against public health care options, reproductive rights, family leave, affordable housing... So those people have really lost me and I tune them out and fake some mild agreement with them now while holding them in deep and lasting disdain. \n\nThey'll never have a moment of self recognition that they're causing the problems they both deny and complain about, they'll never care about the meat grinder they've created and are pushing us towards, they're dumb and mean and ignorant and probably never going to get it. I'm so frustrated, sorry I just had to say it.",

Last year they threw it up to him that he was there \"for free\" but what did it actually cost them to bring him along? He rode in a car that was already going to the same destination, so there were no travel expenses for them to cover. There was a third hotel room, but they would have needed either a third room for the kids or a suite for sister's family anyway. Lodging expenses were also minimal to non-existent.  Doesn't sound like anybody covered his food or activities. He was literally on that vacation for free in that it cost them nothing to bring him along.",

The additional room cost is likely free bc the kids were there and the parents and grandparents wouldn\u2019t want them in either of their rooms! So glad you pointed it out.\n\nOP is definitely NTA. He\u2019s nice enough to help out a bit, but it\u2019s so mean of his sister and parents to dump all of it on him. And to not even ask, but to expect. That\u2019s not a vacation for OP and he deserves one too. \n\nDidn\u2019t his sister enjoy vacations when she was young and single???? She chose to procreate. Take care of your own kids. And if she can\u2019t afford to hire a nanny, then I guess she has to watch her kids herself like the rest of the non-AH people in this world. She doesn\u2019t seem to care that she\u2019s an AH.",

That's why he's stuck with the triplets the entire trip and not even given his own room.\n\nIf anything the kids parents should be sharing a room with their own kids and letting OP who is an adult have his own room.\n\nThey look at OP as an afterthought and when he stood up for himself they threw 'all the money they spent' at him as if it was a lot. When he's literally not costing them any extra and actually saving them money.\n\nImagine having to pay a nanny to come along. Or pay for and plan kids activities for the entire trip. Nope OP watched the kids for free last year because hid parents made him feel as if she owed it to everyone. \n\nThey completely took advantage of him and I'm proud of him for standing up and saying enough is enough.\n\nThere's no reason child minding can't be shared between the parents and grandparents. It just takes some preplanning and negotiating. But they would rather just dump that all on OP and get to kick back the whole time.",

Tell your parents that you can't keep the peace when someone else is responsible for breaking it - your sister's determined steamrollering of your time and goodwill is not something that you can just lie down and take forever. She is a parent and it's her job to care for her own children. Even on vacation. If someone does her the favour of helping out, then she owes them gratitude for the gift, not taking their help for granted and assuming she can force them to sacrifice their entire vacation time. No-one owes her that sacrifice. And no, she doesn't get to palm the kids off on other people overnight, either.",

Why can't grandma and grandpa babysit for a while while the sister and husband go do some vacation stuff? Why can't they plan a vacation that caters to the triplets and what they want to do so that all the adults are interacting with the children during something the kids want to do? The implication is that these people schedule an adult vacation that doesn't really include entertainment for the kids and just drop them with OP. Personally I'd be looking to get all these people out of my life. The only reason they want you on that vacation is so that none of the other 4 people are inconvenienced by \"ugh the triplets that are just so much\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n It's very telling that the sister immediately claims you are ruining her vacation. As a parent I am aware that whatever I go do as a vacation must include something to entertain my kid. I want to go see and do things with my kid. I want them to be a part of the vacation experience. It seems like the sister only brings the children because she can't leave them at home. Your parents and your sister don't respect your time or value your company. I know they might be family but this reaction from your sister implies that this definitely isn't the first time this has happened and probably happens a lot outside of vacations. I'd start looking to cut these people out of your life entirely.",

            "comment": " *was reminded I was there for free.* \n\nObligation is one of the big three manipulations that entitled, manipulative and abusive people use to control others.  **This is obligation, being used to try to control you and make you accept being unpaid labor, and disrespected.**  Family should treat you better than the rest of the world, not treat you like their servant. \n\n *I said I'd be driving myself, and paying for my own hotel stay to have my own room.* \n\nGood for you.  Taking responsibility and control for your own needs is exactly the right thing to do here.  \n\n*My parents were shocked, and tried to remind me of the cost.*\n\nBecause they don't want to say the real reason for their treatment of you out loud.  They know this is wrong to do to you, and they are trying to find other reasons, not the real ones, for manipulating you back into the old patterns where you get to be the unpaid labor so the rest of them can have a vacation.  Maybe they should hire a real nanny, instead of treating you with such blatant disrespect. \n\n*I want to be able to enjoy this vacation as an adult, and not be treated like a child like last year.*  \n\nTreated worse than a child.  Treated like a servant with no rights.  Nannies get time off, and are paid.  You got expectations and disrespect, and not even paid for it.  **It's not a vacation** ***for you*****, when you have no control over your own choices, and are treated like labor, not like family that is equal to the rest** of them.\n\n*My parents told my sister, and she called to blow up at me that I'll be ruining the vacation if I'm off doing my own thing while she has to wrangle her three boys.* \n\nYou wouldn't be ruining the vacation.  You would be making her be responsible for her own choices and decisions and children.  **You would be stopping her from ruining your vacation.  That's reasonable.**  She's not.  **She's trying to manipulate you into not having a vacation, so she can have a break.  She isn't asking you, she's demanding.  That's abusive behavior.**  \n\n**She's trying to make you responsible for her responsibilities.  That's abusive behavior.**  Asking you to take the kids for an afternoon, that would be polite and reasonable.  Demanding you take care of them all for the whole vacation, and pretending that your section of a room being paid is a reasonable payment?  That's ridiculous.  A nanny going on vacation would get a room and wages and time off.  You are being demanded to have less than a servant.  You are being demanded to be her slave.  \n\n*I ended up yelling at her that last year all she did was rope me into her mess.* \n\nYep.  She did.\n\n*I didn't really get to do much of anything I wanted to do. And I was treated like the bad guy for wanting to just go to an art gallery. I'm a grown man. I deserve my own vacation too.*\n\nYes, you do.\r  \n\r  \n*Now my sister is not speaking to me,* \n\n**Silent treatment is a manipulation tactic.  She thinks you will give in, if she punishes you with this.**  See it as a gift, that you don't have to listen to more of her being selfish at you, disrespecting you, seeing you as less than a person.  She's deeply in need of therapy if she cannot see how she's been treating you is wrong.\n\n*and my parents are still trying to convince me to just ride with them to keep the peace.*\n\nWho's peace?  Theirs?  Why?  **Aren't you also their offspring?  Why would they want to keep the peace by demanding one of you serves the other and is disrespected and treated like not a family member at all?  That's not peace.**  It's telling you to suck it up, ignore the abuse and take more of the abuse, so they aren't uncomfortable and your sister doesn't manipulate in other ways.  **They are playing favorites here, subjecting you to your sister's mistreatment like this.  It's wrong.**  They also need therapy to see why it is wrong to treat you this way. \n\n*I'm still refusing. But the pressure is getting to me. AITA for not giving in?* \n\nNTA.   They are all mistreating you.  Check out r/raisedbynarcissists for more help in protecting yourself from their wrong behaviors and abuses.  You are doing well to stand up for yourself.  It's what they should have been doing all along, treating you like an adult.  ASKING, not scheming and planning how to use you as their labor.\n\n*I know they'll have a pretty hard time when they won't have another person there to help.*\n\nThat's their issue.  They could have ***asked*** you to help.  They could have been ***open*** about their plans, and worked out something, with your input and agreement, not by manipulating and demanding your compliance.  They could hire a nanny, and divide up the time that the nanny is off duty, with your involvement, not treating you like you don't count at all.  \n\n*she furious with me.* \n\nShe's not getting her way.   Therapy is needed, sister.  Yes, you have triplets, but that doesn't entitle you to demand from other adults.  Treat your sibling with respect, and learn.  That's what good family would do, ask, respect, show kindness and love and consideration for the other adults, not demand they help by complying with all your wants.  OP wasn't part of your decision to have kids, and isn't responsible.  If OP offers to help, that is up to them, not you.  Family doesn't demand, they ask.  And they accept the decisions of other adult family members.  \n\n*But she's also upset no one in the comments is siding with her.* \n\nHopefully, she can see this as a wake up call, to stop treating you so badly.\n\n*To make it short, she went on a big rant about how it's so hard to be a parent to triplets.* \n\nYep.  It is.  And asking is how to solve this.  Not demanding.  Not manipulating. Not treating your siblings like they are yours to control and order around.  **You aren't her co parent, and you weren't involved in her decisions to have kids.  You aren't responsible to give her a break.  You are allowed to decide** if you want to do this, and if you do, how much, and for how long.  \n\n*And the least I could do is help because I'm young and single, and she needs a break. I stood my ground on my decision, and now she's calling our parents to get them involved.* \n\nIf these people cannot see that their treatment of you is wrong, **it might be time to take your vacation in another place.**  If they can't see that their demands are wrong, that they should have been open about their expectations and how they wanted 'a break' and your help, they aren't going to stop trying to convince you to comply.  Forcing your compliance by emotional abuse is wrong.  Forcing your compliance with manipulation is wrong.  Working together to find a solution, and asking what you might be able to do to help, that's normal.  Accepting your boundaries for how you are able and willing to help, that's normal.  Not all people are skilled with children, or with all ages of children.  You might be great with them at seven, and not comfortable with them at two.  That's your decision to make, if and when and how much you are available.  And **they should accept your boundaries.**",

Having some help is way different than expecting someone to care for your kids for an entire week and asking them to give up their vacation on your behalf. Be grateful for the small amounts of help you would naturally receive without expectations before he chooses to never vacation with you again and you\u2019re 100% on your own. Try asking.

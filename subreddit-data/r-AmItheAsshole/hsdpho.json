    "postText": "So this is a throw away account. While my sister doesn't use reddit, we have mutual friends who do.\n\nI'm a 28F and I have a sister (36F) For the sake of story, I'll just call Jane. Jane is married to \"Bob\" and they have two kids, boy and a girl. My niece and nephew are wonderful kids and no trouble at all. They fight as siblings do but nothing big. I love them. Now for about two years, I did live with my sister. It was a miserable time that really effected our relationship. She saw me as free labor, money and babysitting. Even when I managed to get a small part time job, she demanded I hand over nearly half my pay or get out. It was hell as she took completely advantage of me. I moved out as soon as I could and we have little contact outside of family gatherings.\n\nNow after I moved out, she started complaining how \"She has no help with the kids and never gets a break!\" I babysit sometimes but I have made it clear, just cause I am off work, doesn't mean I want an 8 hour day with my niece and nephew.\n\nAnyway she started talking about how she wanted to foster a kid. Not a kid but a teenager. I pressed her for more info on this. She wants to adopt a teenager so she has a live in babysitter for her kids. This is her logic: \"I want a kid around 16 or 17, you know someone who may have been in the system for awhile. They can share a room with your nephew (she only has a three 3 bedroom house) or sleep in the garage. They can help me with house work, chores, cook and help me with my business.(She bakes and sells cookies) Also babysit the kids so me and Bob can go out sometimes or have some alone time. They'll be so grateful for a home and won't complain. I won't have to pay them at all. And then when they turn 18, I can just sign up for another foster kid! A teenager will be so much easier than a little kid, they will be grateful just to have a roof, food, siblings if they have been separated from their real ones and clothes.\"\n\nI was horrified! Told her it was a horrible idea! She didn't listen to me. She went on with it anyway. About a month ago, a social worker showed up at my apartment to ask me some questions about my sister. She had put me down as a character witness or something like that. I immediately told the social worker why my sister really wanted to foster a kid and how she treated me when I lived with her. The lady thanked me.\n\nMy sister called crying saying that she wouldn't be considered for any adoptions or fosters. The social worker told her that they felt her home and her weren't a good fit. She asked if I said anything and I told the truth. She went off on me, hung up and we haven't spoken since. She has sent some angry texts. A couple family members are on her side. They think foster kids are fucking dogs or something and would be so happy just to have a roof and would gladly do all the housework.\n\nSo AITA here?\n\nEdit: So wow! I didn't know my post blew up like this till I got home from work! Thank you everyone for the kind words, messages and awards.  Remember no child is in control of the circumstances that may have landed them in the foster care system.  They are children and still human. They deserve a loving home and care.  Do right by a foster kid. And thank you again.  Feel free to message me or chat if you like. ",

She had two tween sisters for about 6 months and then they went back to their mom. She wasn't able to do it again after that because it was super hard because one of the girls had a lot of behavior issues, and the money she got from the state just barely covered food and basic clothes and she didn't make enough to really support two other people. She felt bad but it was negatively impacting her own financial stability because she just wasn't able to deny the girls simple things that the money from the state didn't cover like school trips, entertainment money for them to go out with friends, etc. so she ended up paying that stuff out of her own pocket. \n\nShe still talks to one of the girls occasionally (the one without behavior issues) 20+ years later so it's unfortunate she wasn't able to help more kids as I think she was good at it. After that she became a big sister to a couple kids and that worked better. She could still help the kids but it wasn't as expensive or exhausting as being a full time parent.\n\nShe and I talked about it a few years ago. I was an only child and a pretty easy kid. I didn't get into trouble, I was out a lot either working or at after school activities so I was very independent, and when I was home, I was basically just in my room studying or reading for pleasure. She had a hard time adjusting to kids with behavior issues who were very needy and I think it was a lot more difficult than she expected.",

I worked at a school for at risk youth for a few years, and while they were mostly wonderful people they were DEEPLY challenging a lot of the time. Burn out is huge for people who work with this population because it is so emotionally demanding. By and large, they are not grateful for your \u201chelp\u201d even if you are being honestly helpful. Traumatized kids are often very hostile (understandably so) and take so long to trust new people. This woman would only be setting them back in life, convincing them that anyone who tries to come in your life just wants something from them and will not love them.",

She has already ran from them twice and now has to go to church with them so they can keep an eye on her.\n\nOP, thank you for being honest to the case worker and I'm sorry you're getting grief about all this. Most children are in foster care because of abuse and to go into a house with people who are supposed to take care of you only to be treated as a slave? That poor child. Not only would your sister be getting free labor but the state would be paying her for it too. That's disgusting and I'm glad she was turned down.",

When they do show up, most rarely have gone past the front door. They take a photo of the kid and are gone within 2 minutes. I'd like to think they do this for me because it's so evident how much I care for the kids, but would be naive to not think they also let a lot of bad foster homes get swept under there rug this way.",

His mother died when he was 8 years old and I met him in a hospital when my son with Asperger's was hospitalized.   The hospital had a no hugging policy.   I saw this teenager who probably hadn't been hugged since his mother died and my heart just broke.   We probably wouldn't have the relationship we have now if it wasn't for the time, and compassion I gave him.  I love all my kids, but this one needed a mom and I stepped up, and he is so amazing that he holds a special place in my heart.  He's been kicked so many times by the world,  but he gets up again and fights for what he wants.  He just finished school,  difficult for him because his depression can be rough, and started a job in IT. I am so proud of him.",

I was *desperate* to be adopted, and probably would have done exactly what this woman asked and then some, and wouldn't have breathed a word about being unhappy to my social workers. But it would have been so damaging to me.\n\nFoster kids are really vulnerable to exploitation in myriad ways. When I was a teenager living alone in an independent living placement (due to a severe shortage of foster homes in my area), I was befriended by a woman in my neighbourhood who had several children. She had me over on holidays, was the only person who remembered my birthday, would sometimes have me stay over and sleep on her couch and do the mum-and-daughter things I hadn't gotten to experience before, like doing my hair for school or packing me a lunch. But her kindness was manipulation--she'd have me babysit her kids for eight to fourteen hours a day on weekends, have me come over for dinner and then babysit them on weeknights, and even push me to skip school in order to care for her children. I thought she loved me, but she didn't, she loved my labour. I felt the children were my own younger siblings, and on the very rare occasion I got any extra money, I'd spend it buying things for the kids or taking them out. It took me years to extricate myself from the situation. It's so damaging to be encouraged to think of love as something that you earn by giving and giving of yourself to other people.",

Her parents were told it was straight up illegal to have her watch the younger children (she was the oldest. They had 2 bio kids and 3 other young foster kids). Both her and the parents were reminded on several occasions that the parents would be in hot water if they used her for free labor or child care, or that she would be placed somewhere else. She didnt start babysitting her siblings until she was 19 and had aged out of the system (still lived with her parents. I dont know the details on why they didnt adopt her or any of the other kids but they are her parents and treat her just like they do their bio kids. Shes in her lat 30s now with a husband and 2 kids, and her parents are still just as involved as they were when she was a teen. They like to joke she may have aged out of the system, but shes never going to age out of their hearts)",

They'd get her up at 4am for chores, go to school, and work after school taking care of chickens, gardening, feeding hogs and cattle, and canning. She HATED it. Then they adopted a boy followed by a biological son, and she was instant babysitter, unpaid. But they received a check for my sister! The day she turned 18, she left and hasn't been back to even visit. I wouldn't wish her experience on the worst of people, and I've never liked my sister.",

The teenager most of all...but I am LAUGHING that your sister actually thought a teenage foster child would just be happy for a home and somehow super compliant with her demands. The majority of teenage foster children have seen some shit. They often have had very traumatic lives and often have very strong defensive/self-preservation responses as a result (something that is often actually worked on to lessen via a loving home and therapy).\n\nNO WAY would the vast majority of teenage fosters go along with this. The most well-adjusted kindest ones would be flight risks or simply refuse, while her children could honestly be in danger of abuse (negligence, physical, possibly even sexual) with some others.\n\nNone of this is the teenagers fault by the way, as said, they have often had very hard lives and acting out from trauma is very very common. But no way will a teenage foster \"just be happy to have a home\" in which they are further taken advantage of and abused themselves.",

Not only is this treating another human being like a LITERAL house slave(and a DISPOSABLE one at that), but older fosters tend to have been through a horrifying amount of abuse that means they often need a lot of help themselves. Honestly, the plan to have him live in the same room as the younger children is generally not allowed for that exact reason--its incredibly common for sexually abused children to repeat the behavior to other children because they don't know better and its been normalized(and I'm guessing the garage plan wasn't even mentioned to the social worker because that is RIGHT OUT). Older foster children are generally harder to place exactly because they generally need so much work, but all your sister sees is free labor. Unless she somehow lucks out with Actual Cinderella, her flippant plan is not only cruel but exposing her own children to potential physical and sexual abuse, drugs, whatever horrible things the foster child had to do to survive.  \nAlso, I'd extremely not trust any family member that is on her side. You shouldn't be celebrated by adopting a child for your own gain--this is a just a genteel version of Victorian men scooping up orphans and forcing them to work as chimney sweeps and coal miners then discarding them when they get too big to do the work.",

Somewhere that even if that were only there for a couple months, they know the door is always open if they need a place to rest.",

Cooking, cleaning, taking care of all five children, and keeping them all entertained, all while dad worked or hid out, and mom left to go pamper herself or shop. Dad literally told me that \u201che is king, wife is queen, his children and all others in the house are his subjects,\u201d and that his word was final and unquestionable. The first night, the baby woke up and they expected me to race upstairs to get her (I was in a semi-remodeled garage with NO heat in Utah in the winter). The next day I told them I was available from when the kids woke up (or six am, whichever came first) to bedtime, but nights were their responsibility. Dad put up a massive stink about it but I was firm. Two weeks of that, mom parading us around to show off her \u201cau pair,\u201d and when I told them that I was leaving, they refused to pay me and called it a \u201ctrial run\u201d and didn\u2019t even pay for my plane ticket home. It literally cost me money to be their slave for two weeks. Apparently my experience is not uncommon in Utah, because some of the other nannies came to sit with me during church a few days before I left and warned me that the family I was with had already been through four other nannies that year and that most of them were being ripped off massively. Room and board doesn\u2019t entitle someone to treating you like a slave, and no. I was NOT grateful to sleep in a freezing garage with a space heater that only worked for a few hours at a time.",

There are some amazing, wonderful, awesome kids in the foster system and there are also a lot of really badly damaged kids that need a lot of love, counseling and time before they'd be a person you'd want to entrust babysitting to.  Your sis could have received one of the rare ones who's a perfect, caring angel from a loving home who's just been recently orphaned and so grateful that she has a new home that she happily scrubs the floors and does whatever chores are asked.  Or - and more likely - she could get a kid who was badly abused by first her parents, then a series of foster families and other foster kids, who has extensive psychological issues from this and who brings drugs and other crime into the house all while abusing your young niece and nephew and being just generally horrible to be around.  These kids need love, patience and treatment that your sis was obviously not prepared to give so it would have been an awful situation for everybody.",

What will happen to them when they are old enough to take on chores, will they be inundated with unpaid labour? When they get a job, will they be expected to turn in all their wages? Does she actually care for these children? One form of abuse is neglect, and if these children are being deprived of love, affection, care, attention, then that can constitute abuse. I would be very wary, given her attitude towards other children and her remarks around her own, but if social services need to be made aware of her treatment of her own children as well, then it should be done for the sake of the children.",

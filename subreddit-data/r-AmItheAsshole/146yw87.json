    "postText": "Hi! I (24F) recently moved back home to go to school. I am living with my dad (60M) and stepmom (62F). My stepmoms mom will also stay with us occasionally for a few weeks or a month, I\u2019m going to call her Rose. We were sitting at dinner last night and Rose made about a joke about Marie Antoinette saying \u201clet them eat cake\u201d in reference to the staving public. I told her that I believed the quote was actually misattributed to Marie and was almost like propaganda. Rose told me I was wrong and that she was there, then looked me dead in the eye and said \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d. Her saying that was rather rude but completely fair, she doesn\u2019t have to care. I went to bed shortly after and this morning was told by my dad that my stepmom and Rose thought I was incredibly rude and disrespectful. They thought that a 24 yo should not be telling them what\u2019s correct and generally we\u2019re very upset with me. I know I do this sort of thing a lot, and generally it\u2019s because I think it\u2019s very interesting how prevalent misconceptions are in our world. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot and just want an outside view. AITA for correcting her?\n\nETA- thank you everyone for your input. I get that it\u2019s fruitless. For the person who said I\u2019m an \u201cactually\u201d person, I am. I know I am. I like to share information but I get why it annoys people. I agree the best thing is to just ignore stuff and not add what I think is interesting because it is pedantic. Thank you!",

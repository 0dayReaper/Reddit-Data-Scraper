Is it close enough that your parents could come get you? \n\nMy concern would be where they are inviting you there just to be a proverbial \"punching bag\". But, maybe I'm a bit sensitive to that since I've had it happen to me ... or maybe I've watched too many teen dramas or comedies or whatever. \n\nEither way, Without adults around to stop it fast, or without a way to get out of the situation (\"I'm not feeling well, I'm feeling really nauseous/cramps/headache/ whatever\" and have your parents come get you ... ) It could turn it a bad time/bad situation..",

I'm assuming your mother said this because your families are close, and she doesn't want you causing her drama.\n\nYou're allowed to choose who you want to spend time with. Apple is hanging out with bullies and us behaving just like them.\n\nIt's okay to not want to continue being friends with them.\n\nYou do not have to go to her party.",

I\u2019m sick of complying with her random visits to my house and her acting like we\u2019re best friends when she calls everyone in her friend group \u2018her best friend\u2019.

You don't have to be friends with mean people. It's especially valid to observe how they treat other people and not want to associate.  \nMaybe since your parents are friends, ask your parents what they'd think if you didn't go. If they could help you come up with a doctor's excuse or something so it's less personal. And explain how horribly you've seen these girls treat others which is why you don't want to be around them. Send a gift anyway if you don't go.  \nNTA for not wanting to go",

It\u2019s a shame because we\u2019ve been friends for over 4 years at this point but when she started to become friends with this group she started to change into someone I don\u2019t know.

I was planning on being direct with Apple about my reason for not coming because I\u2019ve danced around the issue of her friend group for so long that I think I ought to make this personal so she understands that I don\u2019t tolerate them.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI and this Ex-best friend (Apple for anonymity) don\u2019t talk much anymore, we\u2019re in the equivalent of high school. We used to be inseparable but I noted she was very dishonest and disingenuous, being nice to other friends and then turning around and being rude to me. We talked, on the first occasion she laughed me off, on the second occasion she just apologized. It didn't help that her current friend group is bullies. They love gossiping and will do so at the expense of other people\u2026 there was an incident with an unpopular girl after a school camping trip happened, she asked for extra food from me + Apple\u2019s group and lied that her group didn\u2019t feed her, and this made everyone start making fun of her including Apple. This friend group posts pictures of her on their private chats, making fun of her and they record videos of her saying dumb stuff and circulate them on their group chat. I have seen this first hand + another friend too. They exclude people + ignore people they don\u2019t like. One of my other friends avoids the group because her best friend is part of it and has been \u2018influenced\u2019. I chose to distance myself and we don\u2019t talk much in school/breaks. My mom believes I should \u2018accept my friend\u2019s flaws\u2019 and not use it as an excuse to distance myself but I think it's enough.  \nI feel disrespected when she just talks to me in this fake high-pitched voice acting like we\u2019re still best friends. I hate the way she made everything into a competition academically, socially etc. It drove me crazy whenever she would ask to see my test score. It was never a competition for me. Once I started to distance myself, Apple got her sister to text me and ask me what was wrong when I had already told Apple and she had laughed me off.I recently turned 15, had an exam so postponed my party until this Friday, I booked tickets to a theme park, ended up costing \\~$400. I did invite Apple because our parents are close, I knew inviting her would be the cordial thing to do. A couple of days after my actual birthday, she said that she would bring over her gifts and I said ok. She brought beautiful gifts which probably cost a lot, I appreciated everything but it felt disingenuous to me because we don\u2019t even talk anymore. The birthday went ahead and I had a great time, I think everyone was happy to be there and grateful except Apple. She didn\u2019t talk much, I don\u2019t think she was happy to be there. Apple doesn\u2019t like rollercoasters so that may be the reason why, but this other friend also didn't but was polite and made an effort to talk to everyone despite Apple who didn\u2019t interact much. Her birthday is in a few weeks and she\u2019s splurging on this nice villa \\~$2000, she\u2019s inviting the friend group I avoid, I don\u2019t feel comfortable going, she didn\u2019t seem comfortable at mine... she already told me I\u2019m invited, I\u2019m scared I'm rejecting it out of spite. I know it will have an effect on her (+ family) since they know me personally.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Get her a nice gift, personally I cap gifts for friends at $50 but I'm also in my 30s with a nice job. As a teen I think I did $25 but it's been a while. And at least go to the event, say happy birthday, stay for the cake slicing, and then leaving if you're uncomfortable. \n\nAnyway this is a toxic relationship that is leeching your time and effort. I understand you guys were once close, but you aren't now. It sucks, I've been exactly where you are now. People change and interests split apart. This is a really fast changing time for you and your peers. You will lose and gain a lot of friends. But only if you have the time and energy to do so. If you keep clinging to old friends that aren't treating you right then you can't find new ones that will. \n\nI had a friendship almost exactly like this one. They cold called me in college to try to rope me into an MLM lol.... That's the last I ever heard of them.",

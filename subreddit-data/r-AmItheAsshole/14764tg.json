At dinner time, my MIL seemed irritable. She asked a sister to cut something up and asked me to set the table, so I did. I got the sense that she was irritable due to having to make dinner or tend to us at all.  \n\nMy MIL treated my fianc\u00e9 very poorly during his childhood, and I feel like sometimes she doesn\u2019t want us around, even tho she says differently. \n\nI voiced my appreciation for everything she did. But in my head, I don\u2019t think after traveling all that way that I should be expected to also make dinner. (She never comes to see us). I\u2019m not trying to be rude, but when we have guests at my house I never ask them to do a thing. I think guests should be able to relax. \n\nTo provide cultural context, we are white Americans with minimal religious beliefs. \n\nAITA?",

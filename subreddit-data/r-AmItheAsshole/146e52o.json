Leave the kids out of it until you yourself have met them. And don't go into it hostile. Match their energy. If they've changed, and they're better and accepting people.  Softly welcome them back into your family.\n\nIf they still suck. Cut them off. And make sure your wife understands that you and your kids will not be involved with awful people.",

And I think that you are absolutely right to ground her a little so she doesn't end up being hurt and abused by them again. So you are not at all an AH for feeling wary about this and communicating that to Anne.  \n\n\nBut I also don't think Anne is an AH for having a knee-jerk reaction of immediately accepting their invitation without speaking to you. It's impulsive, but from the sounds of it, it's something she's been dreaming about for a while.\n\nI truly hope they have changed and you don't have to endure any more of their appalling behaviour.  \n\n\nLots of love to you both.",

We have two kids (9M and 7F). \n\nAnne comes from a very religious background. So much so that she was disowned by her parents and entire family when she came out and told them about me. It was a very difficult time for us both, especially her. The period that led to Anne being disowned by her parents was filled with emotional abuse. It was devastating. They did not make the slightest attempt to contact us for the past 12 years. \n\nThankfully, things did work out fine. Now, we're in a stage in our lives where we have kids, our careers are thriving, our friends, and close family members (from my side) are by our sides. Generally speaking, we've reached a point where tension is almost nonexistent and we enjoy every day to the fullest.\n\nLast week, Anne received an email (to her professional address since her parents don't even have her number) from her parents, asking her to reunite and give them a chance. They said they would travel to the city we live in and stay at a hotel, just to get to see Anne for a short while over dinner. \n\nUnlike her usual calm and composed self, Anne is beyond excited to have received this message. So much so that she desperately wants to meet up with them, and accepted their offee without telling me a word about it first. She insists that they may have had a change od heart, that times have changed, and etc.\n\nWhile I undeestand her excitement, I still said she should have told me before she said yes. I told her she should think twice before letting her parents into our lives, and reminded her of the way they were before we lost contact because she seemed to have forgotten about it.\n\nShe apologized for not consulting me and told me I should give her and her parents a chance because she has only one set of parents and doesn't want to miss her opportunity of peace with them if she has the chance. She told me I was thinking about the worst-case scenario and I needed to let her go through this.\n\nI simply worry that they will unleash a whole new set of abusive words and ideas onto Anne and dig deeper into an old wound that still bleeds. However, for objecting to such an idea, I feel like ab obstacle against resolving issues. Does this make me an AH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

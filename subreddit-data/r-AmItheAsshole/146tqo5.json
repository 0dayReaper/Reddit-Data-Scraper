    "postText": "I (17F) am a rising senior at my high school. I'm getting ready for the college application season in a couple months and have several schools selected, most of which are various state schools. I have a spreadsheet with information on them, including costs of tuition and CoL for students there. I have functions on the sheet they show how well I'd be able to afford it using my college savings account that my parents have and my own general savings. \n\nMy parents (40F) and (41M) recently welcomed in my baby brother (1.5M). I was an only child before. I was talking to my mom about college and showed her my spreadsheet. Then she told me that I need to adjust it for half of the college savings as they were planning to give my brother half for his college savings. I was pretty shocked by this since they have 16+ years to save up for his college, if that's something he'll even want to do. I ran the numbers with half the savings and it's not looking good. I want to graduate with as little debt as possible and taking away half is pretty damaging to that. \n\nI tried talking to both of my parents about it but they wouldn't budge. My dad said it's their money so it's up to them how they get to spend it and I'm not entitled to it, which I understand. They said they're hoping to retire early so they have more time with my brother. Funding another college fund would push back their retirement. He also said I should just save more money and not waste it (he's upset I bought myself a switch with my paycheck last month). I usually put most of my paycheck into my savings. He said I'm a smart girl and they can help me figure it out. I still don't think it's fair to lose a good amount of my college funding 15 months away from starting to someone who won't use it for over 15 years.\n\nAITA for not wanting to split the fund with my brother?",

They led her to believe this was her money and she planned accordingly, only to have them pull the rug out from under her at the last minute when there was no time for her to plan differently.

When I pressed, she got defensive and said she'd spent that ages ago and I *knew* she didn't have any savings then. Why didn't I get a scholarship? Why was I bothering HER about money for college? If I wanted college, why hadn't I saved up? \n\n\"Because you told me when I started trying to save my paychecks (yup, working since I was 11 - legally at 15) that it was a WASTE OF MY TIME, as you had it covered.\" She acted like I was silly for believing that she'd do that.\n\nI mean, I was silly/stupid, I see now that I should have known. In the end, I didn't go to college at all, but a tech school I could get into with what money I had, which did work out.\n\nBut that whole \"rug pulled out from under you\" sh** with the adults going \"well, it was always my money so you had no right to make plans. I mean, I told you that I was giving it to you, I told you to make plans with it, but now that you have - you moron!\"\n\nARGH, so annoyed on OP's behalf (and mine all over again)",

For the college funds to equitably match, son would need to receive an amount that would allow for tuition to a similar school for a similar time frame. If OP can only afford two years to a state school now with the rest funded by loans and scholarships, son should receive the same, even if it\u2019s not the same dollar amount. There will be a lot of estimates in the projections (RoR, inflation, cost) which is why it\u2019s totally wild to me that parents have seemed to indicate that they will stop contributing to the college fund. What happens if we have a few more years like the insane inflation of 2022 between now and then? I think there are a lot of future financial implications OP\u2019s parents may not be considering which is why they think they can afford to retire early. It just doesn\u2019t sound well thought out at all. On the flip side, maybe they do have it all figured out. \n\nHowever, as another commenter mentioned, if they are well off enough to comfortably retire early, then a year or two more working should more than fund college for both. Why would parents not want to give their kids that advantage? It\u2019s not like they are going to be 68 pushing off retirement to 70\u2026",

If they can do this with a college fund, they will absolutely be doing it with other things. Babies and \u00fdoung children get a lot of focus (understandably). Combine that with parents who have their priorities skewed and that's a recipie for an ignored older sibling. Doubly so if they are old enough not to \"need\" so much attention in their parents eyes. \n\nAlso, OP, to make this fair they would presumably be giving you half of whatever they would be spending on the brothers college without your fund contributing.

That's the truth.   \n\nAnd saying you should save more is such a BS older person thing. College is expensive and COL is easily triple to quadruple what your parents paid.    \n\nThe reality is you will probably have to take some loans. Apply for scholarships and keep applying while in school. My brother landed a full scholarship for his last year of school. I was able to graduate early by taking a few extra classes and save a fair amount.  \n\nBut it is also a okay to be sad and hurt by this. Your parents did not set this up well. Even if they split it 60/40 - it will grow in 16 years.  \n\nI would ask them if you can split it 70/30 which will allow more to grow. And promise that if you have a really good paying job, you'll contribute some to brother. Trade less debt now for a maybe in the future. Just spitballing",

Not to mention that I've no doubt other aspects of your life have changed since the baby arrived, something you have no control over. They have the right to their reproductive planning, but that doesn't exempt them from their responsibility to you as their child or the promises they made you. You're allowed to be furious, hurt, and so many other things, along with feeling betrayed, but short of their changing their mind, I would take action as if familial contribution is unfortunately a lot lower than you planned. That is to say, if they've been planning to cut yours in half, what is stopping them from an 'emergency' with your brother that also dips in?

The networking you have in dorms and campus events is nothing next to your GPA, your internships (which you tend to get through professors and not through dorm friends), and your choice of major.  I am a huge proponent of saving money by beginning at a community college, assuming you have a good one whose credits will easily transfer, and then transferring for the rest of the degree.\n\n As for the dorm experience - some people love it, others don't, but that's more for the social experience and, for some, it's the economical alternative to an apartment, if they cannot live at home. But for future networking? That's pure chance, and really most relevant to the Ivies.",

In most state systems, accredited in-state community college credits will transfer to 4-year public colleges/universities within that state's system. When changes are made, students who are already enrolled and actively taking (or have taken) affected classes are almost always grandfathered in. On the other hand, many PRIVATE colleges will not accept transfer credits from community colleges. This is something that everyone needs to consider when deciding whether to start at a community college - are you going to want to transfer to an in-state state university, or are you looking at an out-of-state school, or a private school? These things matter.",

That said I transferred from a 4 year to another one, not from CC. The following is my experience (though, I can say my partner experienced similar when transferring from CC to a state school).\n\nI lost a few nontransferrable credits and was also \u201cshort\u201d on some stupid credits a junior would have already had at my destination school (fucking expensive-ass required music and gym classes in college, are you kidding me??). \n\nIf I\u2019d stayed at one school the whole time I could have graduated a year early due to having so many total credits but still had to do two full years at my 2nd school because of the minimum number of required credits that had to be earned there. So I took a senior year full of interesting but not really necessary art and philosophy classes. \n\nFinally, after all that, I almost got screwed out of graduation on time because my advisor didn\u2019t notice one missing subject matter credit \u2014 and I only noticed it right before my last semester because I wanted to double check I was in good shape. So mixed in my fun art and philosophy classes I had to add a random difficult class with a laboratory component in my last term as a senior. \n\nFor anyone planning to transfer I\u2019d say:\n-\tdo your research on credit recognition, ask about the final school\u2019s minimum required credits that must be taken there.  \n-\t\n-\tlisten to your adviser but verify everything yourself, they might be an adult professional but they make mistakes and they can be very expensive for you.  \n-\t\n-\tget involved in some kind of extracurricular activity to meet people like newspaper, student government, campus radio etc. Without having done the freshman dorms thing with everyone else, this is how you\u2019ll likely make like-minded friends and connections that can last beyond school.",

There are so many more scholarships that you can apply for based on categories such as: merit-based, needs-based, scholarship competitions, specialty awards! Re do your spreadsheets. Create one for schools you are applying to/internal scholarships to and then another spreadsheet for external scholarships. Include the due dates on all of them. Start drafting recommendation emails to teachers, community leaders, your manager, etc. (Forgot to add- depending on which state you reside in, if you have a certain GPA/test score range you qualified for further subsidized/free education. Search your states website and include free education/education discount). \n\nLook into out of state schools as well based on your CGPA and SAT/ACT score. Per example- Air Force, West Point, Naval Academy (free education, you get paid while going to school, serve a few years 4-8 I believe). Do not turn down the money at all. You were told full before but now it is half and you can still make up the other have or close to it with proper planning. Definitely look into going away for school if you can and doing room and board. \n\nIt is their money so they can do whatever they want with it albeit they should have told you well in advance. Do not take on the babysitting or any responsibilities surrounding this child. They can deal with it all. I do think it\u2019s absurd to have another child, want to retire early to raise it, and not think about the finances that come into play outside of post secondary education for a baby who has 18 years until college. Your parents aren\u2019t being very realistic and will set themselves and your younger brother up for failure. BUT focus on yourself. Please PM me if you have additional questions or want more scholarship names/how to go about things. This situation should give you the fuel you need to be resilient and determined!",

When they do finance their child's college education, parents are sort of buying their kid more childhood, more time to be free of big responsibilities. Not all parents can or want to do this. Those kids just have to jump into full adulthood immediately. So, don't ever let them make you feel bad if they ask you something and you need to say, \"I can't. I need to work.\" \"I can't.

You need to know- is this college fund a 529? Who controls it? If it is designated for you, they can't simply redirect the funds until you are past a certain age (like if you have left over funds and are 25, they can be applied to another child). Is it advantageous or possible to do the FAFSA based on your own income, which might make you Pell eligible (it is possible to FAFSA without parental involvement, but it's tricky). If you can get the Pell, many universities offer scholarships to go with it and really boost that amount up. What aid does each school offer based on need and academics? Some schools hand out scholarships based on ACT scores, others looks at GPA (Kansas gives out so much money based on grades, I was astonished! And one MO school will cover full tuition for an ACT of 24 or higher), and some tiny schools have huge endowments, so they give away more than you would expect. I was freaking out about my kid's college and talked to financial aid many times. They really came through- between a Pell, a generous grant through the university to support Pell students and other under-represented groups, federal work study, and small federal loans, we got a 40k bill down to 15k, which we have in a 529 controlled by grandparents. We can pay down the loans when she graduates with anything left in the 529. Also, if she sticks with a certain academic program, there will be more money, and grants if she learns certain languages through that program. \n\nFinally, your parents are very short sighted and I am sorry for that. Go away, don't stay home and end up their babysitter. My parents and I are doing everything we can to ensure my kids get an education and not end up saddled with debt; I am utterly baffled as to why yours are not. I am also baffled that they don't grasp how their choice here will utterly destroy any relationship you have with them and this new sibling going forward. College is more than a degree, it's the time you learn who you are, what you want to be, become a fully formed human outside the sphere of the home, learn to adult, make professional and personal contacts that will be life-long, and honestly have a great time with some guard rails still in place. Join the band, be greek or not, work in the campus library or gym, study abroad, do better than I did in statistics, build a robot, suck every ounce out of the experience. And then absolutely rock the rest of your life and leave them at home, following your adventures on Instagram and wondering why you don't want to come visit at Christmas.",

Considering your spreadsheet you seem like a very organized and resourceful person, and this will serve you better in a scholarship hunt than a 4.0 GPA.

Or if you have to do a loan, in the long run it would be way more cheaper emotionally not to have them hold it over your head. Seriously, go to school, you can do it, check on more scholarships, if you can qualify for FAFSA, you can do community college, just make sure that you work with a counselor to ensure that the classes you take will transfer. A good college will have relationships with universities. Just takes a bit more work on your end. And some community colleges actually have a four year degree on campus. One I went to, actually has an online course at the college. \n\nAnd when you graduate, don\u2019t tell parents anything financial.

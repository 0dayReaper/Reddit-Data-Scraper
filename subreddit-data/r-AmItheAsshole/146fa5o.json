    "postText": "I (26M) met Sarah (24F) around February this year through work. I was given an opportunity prior to us meeting to travel to a different country for a special event, all expenses paid\u2026For me at least. In our conversations I brought up this opportunity &amp; told Sarah that she could come as a  +1. \n\nShe talked to her mom for a week and then agreed to come. Weeks leading up to the trip we talked more to plan and there was a bit of flirting going on. People have told me I\u2019m just a flirt. I went for a couple of drinks with coworkers, not including Sarah, and realized I that I was leading her on. From there on I made sure I wasn\u2019t flirting. \n\nI was annoyed that her mom was taking control of the trip and planning the whole thing. The whole itinerary was basically hers. She asked for my input but I felt she was just asking to include me. On the way to the airport I realized that we don\u2019t have anything to talk about. Completely different interests &amp; sense of humor. \n\nFast forward to us in the country. Walked around the city the first night in complete silence. Following day, same thing. Tried to make conversation but often got one word responses. Tried to make a few jokes here and there, all I got was weird looks from her. \n\nI asked Sarah what she wanted to do since I\u2019d been to this country before and she almost always responded with \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. I thought this response was crazy. Her  mom basically planned the whole trip! She texted her mom all the time so her mom could tell us where to go!  I was familiar with getting around but her mom constantly texted to ask what subway we were taking, explaining how to get from point A to point B. By the end of the day I was over it &amp; just wanted to enjoy a beer. Come to find out, she doesn\u2019t like going out at night. Nightlife in the country we were in is the best part, but she preferred to be in bed by 8pm. I didn\u2019t want to leave her alone so I stayed in.\n\nThis was the pattern every day\u2026Until we meet up with a group of friends. It was a lot of people\u2019s first time there so they were excited to see all the different things. However, Sarah was not amused that they were excited over \u201cthe basic little things\u201d.  I could hear her phone calls with her mom (paper thin walls). She called her mom &amp; seemed bothered that we didnt know anything about the country we were in. \n\nEvery night I could hear these calls \u2014 they were always complaints &amp; negative comments about me and friends. Only to act as if everything was fine the following morning. What a two face is what I thought. I couldn\u2019t imagine spending anymore time with her. I made up an excuse to leave home early. I said that I had an emergency and had to leave  ASAP. That same night I overheard her talking on the phone with her mom about how she didn\u2019t believe the reason I gave.\n\nI cut my trip 10 days short and left. However, I didn\u2019t leave her alone because she stayed with family friends she\u2019d never met the rest of the trip. AITA?",

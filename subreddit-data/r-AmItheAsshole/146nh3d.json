    "postText": "My parents threw me a party for graduating university. My mom did most of the leg work for it (cooked and bought most of the food, including a cake that was hundreds of dollars). At this party, a lot of the gifts I received were monetary. I haven\u2019t looked at the gifts yet but it\u2019s probably a lot of cash. My mom wants me to \u201cshare\u201d the money with her to reimburse her for part of the party. \n\nMy parents make way more money than I do and I\u2019m really grateful for all the work my mom put into this party but I also feel like the gifts were earned by me for graduating so I\u2019m torn. WIBTA for keeping all of the money?",

Automatically makes you NTA point blank. \n\n2.  Did you specifically ask for this cake that was \u201chundreds of dollars\u201d (not worth btw) or did she just go out of her way for it?\n\n2(a). If you asked\u2026 why..? \n\nThat\u2019s all. Honestly no matter how you answer, my judgement won\u2019t change. I hope your graduation was good!",

Money is so important and overvalued that people have lost sight of meaning on gifts and invitations . The gift as an idea originated in politics as tribute. A powerful king would demand tribute as a show of power, so gifts were political. In modern times, gifts are a show of affection and appreciation. In OPs case, the graduation is an academic accomplishment ,showing persistent work ethic. Your graduation is an accomplishment that family can both point to, and give rewards for. A host throwing the party assumes responsibility for the party, their event is the gift. To demand repayment is wrong on its face. Making the graduate responsible for the party is a violation of the social contract for the event. \nIf I issue an invite for dinner, concert, amusement park, etc, I am paying, thats the deal.

My mom did most of the leg work for it (cooked and bought most of the food, including a cake that was hundreds of dollars). At this party, a lot of the gifts I received were monetary. I haven\u2019t looked at the gifts yet but it\u2019s probably a lot of cash. My mom wants me to \u201cshare\u201d the money with her to reimburse her for part of the party. \n\nMy parents make way more money than I do and I\u2019m really grateful for all the work my mom put into this party but I also feel like the gifts were earned by me for graduating so I\u2019m torn. WIBTA for keeping all of the money?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

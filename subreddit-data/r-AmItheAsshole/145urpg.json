    "postText": "My (18) grandfather (85) is very unwell, he spent a little while in hospital, now he is home and is being completely taken care of by my uncle (49) my uncle has two daughters Kitty (14) and Sunny (6) (not their real names) and they are both going to start summer vacation soon. With their mum working and my uncle spending all his time looking after my grandfather it's difficult to set up a routine for them for their vacation. Usually Kitty visits her aunt (Kitty and Sunny are half siblings through their mother, so this is Kitty's aunt on her fathers side) in another country while my aunt and uncle take care of Sunny. The original plan was for Sunny to stay with my uncle in my grandfathers house but it is a worry because he is so physically and mentally unwell the experience will emotionally scar Sunny. \n\nSo my aunt (57) suggested both Sunny and Kitty stay with us throughout the Summer vacation. Even though we are both working full time, with the idea Kitty will look after Sunny while we are at work and on our days off (we don't have the same days off) my aunt and I will take over.\n\nHere's the thing, not only do I think this is unfair for Kitty who's just finished a load of exams and deserves the Summer of her dreams, but I also don't want this plan to go through. \n\nI adore Sunny, she's your typical sweet and playful 6 year old girl. However I work a very physical job where I spend 7 hours a day running around and on my feet, so I'd like to rest on my days off. With a child as playful as Sunny that isn't going to be possible, it'll be another full time job in itself and I just don't have the energy for it. \n\nObviously I want what's best for Sunny, our family has been through a lot of difficulties ever since I was young and I don't want her to experience something traumatic the way I did when I was her age. But I also know taking care of her and having a full time job is going to absolutely exhaust me. Maybe I'm being unreasonable but I feel a little too young to be taking this all on. I'm good with kids but there's a difference between spending a few hours with one and spending a couple months taking care of one.\n\nI also feel it's important to note the language I share with this side of my family isn't one I'm 100% fluent in. Maybe about 75% fluent but I can't shake the feeling that something bad might happen to Sunny and I won't be competent enough to help her or call for help if needed. Also we live four hours away from my uncle and grandfather I won't know what to do if she feels homesick. \n\nNothing is set in stone yet, it's possible we might be able to find another solution that suits Sunny better, however the possibility is real I'll have to take care of her and if I'm honest I'm dreading it. Regardless of my feelings, I will help take care of Sunny. But maybe talking about it with my aunt might help too. \n\nSo, WIBTA?",

It is much preferred if their vacation can be fun. \n\nWhat makes vacation fun? Doing fun things, going out once in a while to go swimming or somesuch. \n\nBut a 14y old having to watch a 6y old during the day isn't good experience for either of them, not just the 14y old. \n\nYou aren't able to step in here. Even if you fake the energy- kids can tell. \n\nNow, your aunt seems to be the type that loves to help out. Discuss how she sees the girls having an as good time as possible in that framework. Don't be scared to discuss your limitations in this. Maybe your aunt can enlist the help of others to entertain the girls. Maybe the parents can decide to send the girls to day activities or summer camp. \n\nIf you need something like a script, let me know!",

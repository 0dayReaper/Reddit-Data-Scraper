You are 27 years old...an adult, you are being so kind and generous by helping her already but that does not make you a child again where you have to tell your mom every single thing you're doing. The things she said to you when you came home was just straight up manipulative and gaslighting, purposely trying to make you feel bad because you didn't wait on her hand and foot that day. I understand she has mental issues but that is not you fault nor your responsibility and you are allowed to go out and do things on your own! It may be time to go over boundaries and expectations with her and remind her you also have a life.",

The way she overreacted and guilt tripped you is hard to read, and I get that she is manic depressive but she needs therapy. I'm EXTREMELY CURIOUS as to how your wife sees this situation, and beyond that, your mother needs professional help, and as long as you both live with her, you can't quite progress towards children if you two are considering that because it would be irresponsible. Mostly because you don't know how your mother will be of and when the time comes, and to worry about children and your mother is gonna destroy you.",

I'm currently an engineering intern at a O&amp;G multinational, graduating this year. I get paid decently enough for an internship. Don't know if they'll hire me yet, but some place will, and we all agreed first thing will be to pay her the last 4 years of work she needs to retire, and I'm waiting to see the amount in the paycheck to negotiate with her that I'll only do this if she also goes to theraphy.\n\n&gt;I'm EXTREMELY CURIOUS as to how your wife sees this situation\n\nWe live in a third world country and are graduating very late. We don't plan on having kids. She wasn't home but I vented with her, as we do with our family stuff, and she gave me an idea to just send my mom some money every week, so she can use it whenever and however she needs instead of depending on me. But to be fair, she DID ask to go in my place, I was just automatically polite and said no, when I should have just gave her the card and avoid this entire thing.",

Hmm... I think you should recommend a once a week sitdown with your mother to check in where she's at mentally, and also, perhaps she feels alone? So once a week, an hour to sit and chat specifically for mom would probably do wonders for her anxiety.",

I love my mother, and I'm very proud of how she raised me, but I feel horrible when I fuck up like this\r  \n\r  \nShe's been facing mental health and financial issues for the past 10yrs, with no support system and improvement. The last 5yrs have been **bad,** losing jobs every 4 months. She's been depending on my estranged grandfather since her divorce, who sends us a min. wage/month. We help with basic chores: trash, groceries, washing clothes, hanging them to dry, ocasionally cooking. We share the bills, but I try to establish our limits, since me and my wife are both working &amp; studying we can't exactly dust and mop every 15 days like she wants\r  \n\r  \nYesterday my mom told me we needed a soda, some pepper and cheese. We live close to the market and but she offers to go in my place, but I refuse. While shopping I stumble on my friend, who's been having trouble with his computer, so I come over to his house right next door. We chat for 1h and my mom calls, worried. I admitted to fucking up by not telling her where I was, she says she was putting on clothes to leave the house looking for me and laughingly adds that I'd have to buy some icecream to make it up for it now. I relax, laugh, and say \"no problem. I'll be back soon\". Time flies and 40min later I get a text: \"Son, where is the soda I asked for?? You always make it so stressful to ask you for things. You should have just gone to the market like I asked, went back home and THEN went to see your friend. Don't do me dirty like this.\"\r  \n\r  \nFeeling guilty, I wrap up with my friend, buy icecream and go home. She was pretty mad, asking me who taught me to be so selfish and how she cleans the entire house even through pain for me. I say sorry and put the stuff in the fridge. She notices how I forgot to buy the cheese and adds: \"You know I don't have money anymore. Oh, I need to stop being a sucker for other people. I'm not gonna ask for stuff ever again. Just live off of water and bread!\" I just say sorry again, and go buy the cheese. She locks herself in her room crying, I ask if she needs to vent more, doesn't answer so I give her some space\r  \n\r  \nShe's silently watching netflix in her locked room since yesterday, only coming out to eat and go to the bathroom. She didn't even respond to me today, and I'm worried about what's going through her head, especially given the signs and talks about her mental state we've had before\r  \n\r  \n**TLDR**: Mom is depressed and on unemployment loops for 5 years. Asks me to get groceries after lunch, I get distracted for 1h. She calls me worried, it should have been a 15 minute thing, we joke about it on the phone. 40min later she sends an anguished message, I run over and she's mad at me for being selfish and at herself for having little to no independence. She cried a bit and locked herself in her room for some 36 hours now. AITA?\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But suffice to say, its bad.\n\nI wouldn't say she's entitled, because our entire financial situation and dependency is thanks to her being the youngest child. My grandparents put every ounce of care and investment on their firstborn, a little bit on the middle child and gave her the tired \"just do whatever you want\" treatment. She was young and naive, picked Arts and has been regretting it ever since. To make it worse, 20 years ago, when she broke up with my father, my grandfather **convinced** her to quit her job as a supervisor in a big classy furniture store chain, which had her working 12h shifts 6days a week, but could sustain a house a child and my jobless father, to get a lower paying job to take more care of me, since it would be just the two of us. In exchange he would send the min wage every month and help with emergencies until I was up on my feet and she was \"back on track\". She never managed to get back on track, her health has only deteriorated and until I managed to get a job two years ago we have been in many tight spots.",

If I was taking care of my mother she'd never ask me to get her ice-cream at all, she wouldn't want to bother me, I'd have to ask her if she wanted one and offer to go and get it and she'd still say \"no don't worry\". If she got mentally ill and started making those kinds of demands I would be more forgiving, because it's completely out of character for her. What I wouldn't tolerate is being treated like a child being bossed around when I'm a grown married man.\n\nSame with pouting in her room. Don't know how much is mental illness and how much of it is immaturity, selfishness, and never learning communication skills.\n\nThe bottom line is that you're definitely not an asshole here, but whether it's NAH or NTA depends on the source of the specific bad behaviour from your mother.",

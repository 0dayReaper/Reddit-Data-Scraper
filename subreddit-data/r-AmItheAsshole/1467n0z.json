This is annoying, as she\u2019s already yelled at me for \u201cstepping too loud\u201d this morning, and i am not in a good mood. but I try on the clothes anyway, tell her if they are too small or too big, and get back to my room. she asks me to prepare lunch for myself and my sister(F14) because she is \u201cbusy\u201d. i get out of my room and see her scrolling on tiktok on the couch. I am especially annoyed, since i pay for my own food, so my little sister would have to eat MY food, since my mom would throw a fit if i used any of hers. but whatever. \n\nso as im walking to the kitchen, I say \u201cso since i\u2019m doing this, could you give me a ride to work?\u201d. she starts yelling \u201cNO. I AM BUSY. CANT YOU SEE??\u201d so i say \u201cwell i\u2019m busy too. if you\u2019re so busy, just don\u2019t come to graduation.\u201d then she called me the r-slur and stormed off into her room. (side note, my father and his fianc\u00e9, both of whom despise my mom(side note side note it\u2019s mutual)are going and i would rather not deal with it.)\n\nmy grandfathers called me this morning and called me an asshole, saying that my mother is crying, and i need to reinvite her. my mothers side of the family is all saying the same, but my sisters and father agree with me. \n\nAITA?",

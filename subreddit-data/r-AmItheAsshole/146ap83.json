    "postText": "I started a new job, so I will have gone about a month without pay before I get my first paycheck. Two of my children had birthdays, two proms, and a high school graduation, so I spent a lot of money on that and made sure I paid my bills. My sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 had a birthday, and I am down to my last $40. I didn\u2019t even remember it was his birthday with how busy I have been with birthdays, proms, and graduations, until my mother sent two texts last week telling us it was his birthday. I planned on getting a gift on Thursday, but my former employer did not pay me my bonus I was due to receive before I left employment. Yesterday, I told the fianc\u00e9 and my dad I would bring him a birthday gift next week when I got paid from my new job due to my low funds. They were okay with this and understanding of my situation. \n\nWell, today, my mother called me and said everyone needed a gift and she called everyone and told them they needed to give him a gift. I told her I had already talked to him and that I did not have the money for gifts until next week. She then commented on the packages I received, implying I had money for that but not a gift. I told her those were for my children\u2019s birthdays and graduation, feeling like I had to justify what I did for my children. To try to avoid more drama from her, I took $25 of my last $40 and bought a gift card. I took it to her house, said hello and bye and left. \n\nLater I got a text about how I\u2019m being dry and my personal problems with my husband have nothing to do with the family and I\u2019m disrespecting her. I was floored, so I called her. I told her my husband had nothing to do with this, and that she shouldn\u2019t have called me lecturing me about a gift when I spoke to my sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and let him know he would receive a gift from me next week. She said she had no clue I talked to him and nobody told her. I told her that I didn\u2019t know I had to go thorough her to let her know about the gift. I told her the reason I\u2019m mad is because she implied I had money for my own purchases but not for him. I then told her my sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is not my child, and my children and bills come first. I said gifts for siblings\u2019 partners are not a necessity when I\u2019m low on money and have bills and children. She told me his gift was a necessity, and accused me of disrespecting her and told me if I didn\u2019t want a relationship with her that was fine. \n\nI was shocked. I never said anything about not having a relationship with her. I told her she was disrespectful to me for all of this. Then she said I didn\u2019t have to speak to her ever again. I then told her she was turning into my grandmother and she hung up on me. \n\nAITA?",

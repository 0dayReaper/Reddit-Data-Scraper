All the reasons he wants to be together or be a father are more for his benefit. \nGood luck to you, OP and your baby. It might be a long road ahead but you can do this. You\u2019ve made it this far",

So for my brother, not having his parents together anymore was great. As I grew older and interacted more with my father (until eventually going NC), I can honestly say that I am also glad that they divorced. My father showed time and time again that he cared more about money than me. So yeah, ignore your sister and do what\u2019s best for you, and what will make you happy, because ultimately that will be better for the child. No one wants their parents to be miserable every day just to try to keep some sort of \u201cfamily\u201d (you\u2019re really not if it\u2019s constant turmoil).\n\nSorry, edited to change SIL to sister.

No serious boyfriends, always just been me and my kids.\n\nI actually have to talk to my kids a lot about how breaking up with someone shouldn't always be the first option and how sometimes their friends want to vent rather than be told to break up all the time. Now my kids are teenagers and going off to college (I'm a wreck but pretending like this isn't devastating and I don't miss them every second of the day so they can be happy) and are like, \"We'll start dating after college. We want to get our education first.\" \n\nOP, you be the mom you need to be. Being a single parent is tough when the kids are young because physically you're doing more than being an old woman like me and getting phone calls each day while dispensing sage-like advice. Enjoy your time when it's just your baby and you. It's gone before you know it. One day you'll be like me; both dreading and excited when the kids move on and you're not #1 anymore.",

Some parents never learn to do that and you're doing it naturally! \n\nYou have proven yourself to be an intelligent, reasonable, rational, self-sufficient, understanding person. Your baby is going to have a good life with a mother who knows what she's getting into and who won't have to carry the burden of a toxic partner on her back. I don't know you, OP, and I hope that I don't sound condescending, but this total stranger is proud of you. \ud83d\ude42",

Also you own your own place, have a job and seem like a lovely, strong person so leave him waste the courts time because he hasn't a hope he be lucky just to get visitation.\n\nYour sister needs to come out of the fog a child does not need two parents let alone them live together. All a child needs is a parent to love, care and nurture them and they will grow up absolutely fine. I'm a single single mother and my daughter is absolutely perfectly happy and absolutely amazing. You can do this by yourself and beva great mother and don't let anyone tell you any different.",

They kicked me out when I was a teenager for no good reason, she's tried to get me to mend fences with them and I've refused, and of our whole extended family I'm only in touch with one sister (her) and one brother.",

He was expecting me to sell my flat, buy a new place, put us both on the deed for the new place, and put any extra cash into his business, which would have just been his. So he only wanted us to share things when it worked for him.",

Finally something else but my own insecurities to judge something by, get a new perspective on things. \n\nMy head is usually full of \"is this right? Am i being selfish? Or is the other person selfish? Should i have done it different? Could i have done it better? *I don't know!\"* And that spirals away with me until i still think about it years later. \n\nSometimes you're also just to emotionally involved to be sure you're thinking about this rationally and clearly, so an outside perspective helps a lot! \n\nAnd because i don't want to put this in a separate comment: \n\nYour sister sucks. I hope one day she will understand that a happy family isnt based on the roles that are filled, but on the love and care and respect that the people actually involved show each other. \n\nMy mother stayed with my father because she was afraid to be a single mom and \"kids need their father\".\n\nIf i could, i would go back in time and bitchslap the thoughts out of her, give her 10,000 DM and tell her to dump his ass because he doesnt give a shit about her and is not fit to be a father. \n\nCongratulations on the pregnancy.

If you would like me to PM you some sex worker friendly resources to help you access a good lawyer who will stop your ex using your stripper past against you or a list of places with non judgemental support let me know. I am an ex sex worker and know how often supposedly progressive and professional people judge long after you leave and this guy has already declared his intent to use you being a stripper to control you.\n\nSo I\u2019d prepare yourself for the fact he might use that against you in custody or child support or that he and your sister may contact Social services over it. I know you don\u2019t expect they will but I doubt you expected any of this so far...\n\nAlso it sounds like this has also brought up the final estrangement of your family and that is really painful and a deep grief. I am estranged from family myself and it can feel fine and resolved because you think you are used to your particular family dysfunction and then it hits you in new ways and it ebbs and flows.\n\nI recommend a site called UK Standalone who deal with estrangement including specialist therapists, information about things like grandparents muscling in and support groups. It might be worth a look as while there is a tonne of info out there on the stuff people do that push you to estrangement but then nothing much on estrangement itself. So they fill a great gap.\n\nAlso please PM if you would like to chat. I had a similar childhood and recently had my last family connection severed due to someone interfering out of their own place of thinking. I thought the last loss would be like closure but was surprised how much deeper it went than earlier ones in unexpected ways.\n\nI am delighted though you are safe. You have been on my mind. I hope that this pregnancy is a true time of transformation for you that as your baby grows you evolve into your new life with your new family of two. You sound like a hell of a person and I wish you much luck and love with your baby (and your flat!)\n\nEDIT: saw the comment downthread about the stuff you posted in UK Legal Advice and I\u2019m so sorry my fears were confirmed but really glad you have a lawyer who is not fucking around and isn\u2019t SWERFy. That was my big worry. \n\nSWERF shit is so engrained here in the UK it\u2019s so easy for people to target (ex) sex workers knowing the judge or social worker is anti sex work and will not support you even if you are their client but \u2018save\u2019 you. You found someone as badass as you. I am SO pleased for you to have support after having to do life by yourself so much.",

OP said in the comments that her family was kinda dysfunctional, so it's likely that she has some sort of trauma or belief that a complete family would've fixed everything for her. Usually, when one goes through something like this, they usually get one of two beliefs: that you need a strong nuclear family for the family to function or that you actually don't and a strong parent is all you need. I got the second belief.\n\nMy family wasn't dysfunctional. I had a good family. Until my sperm donor cheated on my mom. He then changed completely. I don't know anything anymore. I don't know if I knew the true him. I don't know if that's the true him. His past him, at least, was awesome. I still remember my parents being lovey dovey. But now? Not only I don't know that person, I can even say I don't want him to be my dad. I used to want him back (well, it was hard to let go of wanting his love), but I don't need that person! Neither does my mom! I'm so glad he refused her willingness to forgive him! We don't need a POS that tries to destroy someone because they don't agree with his cheating and child abandonment! (He somehow believes that he didn't abandon us. He says all the time that he gives us presents and all that. Imagine my face when someone tells me I'm so lucky because my sperm donor got me this and that and I didn't)",

My father was barely ever home anyways, out partying, cheating, doing drugs, gambling all our money away, and when he was home my parents would have physical fights right in front of me because my mother thought if I was nearby he wouldn't hit her. The whole thing fucked her up emotionally and she would let her frustrations out on me, verbal and physical. No child should have to hear the things that were said to me, as much as they claim it was \"just words\", it hurts when you're so small and don't understand any of it. No child should face violence for minor mistakes or no reason at all. I ended up turning into a rather quiet and withdrawn child, and got bullied in school for it. I never really had a peaceful safe place. They eventually divorced, despite my father threatening my mother with violence if she did it. Things have calmed down a lot between me and my mother, though I still want to move out as fast as I can. My father is still in debt, lost our childhood house, keeps telling everyone how he never did anything wrong and blames my mother for everything, still takes drugs and gambles, it's a shitshow. I have zero trust in my parents. I have been in therapy for a while now but still struggle with cPTSD from the whole thing, and maybe for the rest of my life.\n\nStaying in a broken household \"for the child\" is absolute bullshit. Children can tell there's conflict even if they don't directly witness the arguments. Having a peaceful and loving childhood is so much more important than having a toxic parent just to have a \"family\". Stop ruining kids childhoods over the idea.",

He then saw his child only as a cash cow to pay off his business debts.  As the mother and as you\u2019re not married.  You should get sole custody by default no legal case required.  As you own your own property and also have an income and he has neither this all should go in your favour. \n\nIs also suggest as his business is failing he\u2019s not going to be able to afford any kind of legal representation so this might also be a tactic to force you into an expensive legal case which makes you get to the point of selling your property to pay for it.  \n\nI would however have a very hard word with your sister.  Tell her if she cannot support you or your decisions regarding your child now over someone else\u2019s idea for raising your child then you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea the child she\u2019s not supporting is in her life at all. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t need to agree. It\u2019s not her child.  As a parent you will get a metric ton of other people\u2019s best intended advice and they\u2019ll often inexplicably get very upset if you don\u2019t follow it.  \n\nThese people are well meaning egotists.  You\u2019re the parent you decide what\u2019s best for your child.  And if they cannot respect that they cannot be in your child\u2019s life because of the damaging consequences of having an undermining influence to your base parenting.  \n\nBut don\u2019t have this conversation with her.  Have it with your parents first.  It sets out the stall on where boundaries are and from the sounds of it she\u2019s going to need to learn there are some within her role as aunt. \n\nDo it early. Draw that line in the sand.  Otherwise you\u2019ll end up with the baby who went to aunties house and came back with ear piercings because auntie thought it was best/looked cute/wanted to treat them/etc.\n\nEdited to add: \n\njust saw your post on UK legal advice.  \n\nWhat he did was straight up rape here in the UK.  \n\nConsent for sex is given under the pretext that protection is used had it been and it failed no rape but what his did was deliberately tamper with it and thus meant he intended to have sex without protection when the consent was with.  \n\nThat\u2019s coercion and rape.  \n\nHe cannot force you to pay him child maintenance he\u2019s delusional.  As the birth mother unless there\u2019s some serious reasons (drug addiction, history of sexual assault by you with minors or having relationships with know sex offenders, presently living off immoral earnings (flat doesn\u2019t count that\u2019s in the past) you automatically have full custody. \n\nsocial services here are going to take a very, very dim view of this and the csa and UK courts if he is caught on tape as you have done admitting to a crime. \n\nWhich I would in your own time point out to your sister and tell her if she continues to side with your rapist over you and your child she\u2019s never seeing them ever.",

My daughter\u2019s (14) father hasn\u2019t been in her life since she was 6 months old. I\u2019ve raised her myself without him. She has several positive male role models to look up to, the majority being in law enforcement (she\u2019s screwed if she tries sneaking out or partying like crazy LOL). She\u2019s asked about her father and I\u2019ve never talked bad about him, I\u2019ve just explained that him and I couldn\u2019t get along and that\u2019s that. That\u2019s one thing I beg of you not to do - if he bails and doesn\u2019t come around after all is said and done so be it - but NEVER talk bad about him to your child. When she/he is old enough they will come to that decision on their own. My daughter did. She\u2019s also never felt like less or like she\u2019s missing a parent because my circle is small and supportive. Keep the people that support you close. THAT is your complete family. At 14 my daughter loves music and plays around a dozen instruments, she\u2019s active in several extra curricular activities and she has already planned her high school career with her counselor (just starting hs this year) and discussed what she needs to do to either graduate a year early or with an associates degree. She is focused and determined and her father is missing out on knowing a lovely and brilliant girl but that\u2019s his loss and we\u2019ve never needed him to be complete. You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders and you will do right by your child without him, remember that. Enjoy raising your baby in the flat you earned and paid for yourself. If he really wanted to be there he wouldn\u2019t be bitching about how you paid for your home. Stripping is a job and is nothing to be ashamed of \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Good luck!!",

    "postText": "I (male 22) work at an international company, 99% of my job takes place online and I only know most of my co-workers through group chats. Our boss schedules in-person meetings once a year though, so we can get to know each other. At one of those meetings, I befriended two co-workers from different countries, Max (29) and Bob (38). The three of us had the time of our lives and we all stayed in touch after and became good friends. We had group calls all the time and were even known as a trio amongst our other colleagues soon. All 3 of us are gay btw, which becomes relevant later. I was even closer with Bob. It quickly became a habit that we would text all day and then call every evening. My boss scheduled the next in-person meeting in my city. Of course I offered both to stay with me. Max preferred to get a hotel with his boyfriend but Bob gladly accepted. During that week, Bob and I hooked up. We were both sad when he had to leave. However I quickly noticed that he became a lot more sensitve to things I said after. Any minor disagreement and he\u2019d get upset. But we still had our daily calls and then had the idea that us 3 should take a trip together. We found a nice destination, booked an apartment and flights. A few days after booking my flight, I finished an important project for work &amp; shared it in a big group chat with the entire company. I got positive feedback from my co-workers but Bob sent a thumbs-down. I asked him what was wrong. He didn't reply but blocked me on all social media platforms and let Max know that he canceled his flight. I had no idea what triggered this reaction. He apologized a few days later, said that he overreacted and re-booked his flight. The vacation happened and started nicely. But one morning I woke up and found both gone. I texted them and asked where they went. No reply. I couldn't leave the apartment because they took the keys with them. An hour later, they came back to the apartment and said that they just grabbed some breakfast at a place nearby. I asked them to tell me next time. They both got defensive and said \"Why? We weren't gone for long anyway\u201c I started to feel excluded. During the evenings, they went out on the balcony and chatted &amp; whenever I joined them, they would stop talking. The next morning, they were gone again, and ignored my calls. I went down to the coffe place they allegedly went to last time and I saw both of them sitting outside, enjoying a full breakfast without me. Bob asked why I came down here and said that I should stop interrupting their conversations. I asked them again to just communicate with me. Max didn't say anything during that discussion. After the trip, Bob called me and told me that I ruined his vacation because I always followed him around and that he's sick of my feelings for him. I tried to explain that I just wanted to feel included in our group. He now claims to have panic attacks because of my behaviour &amp; that it also ruined Max\u2018s vacation. AITA?",

We got along at the start but then essentially moved his girlfriend in our house and didn't contribute anymore to the household or rent. I didn't handle the situation very well and things got somewhat uncivil, never between me and the girlfriend, it was always just arguments with me and my friend. Anyway time passed and me and my friend get along again but she absolutely hates me with a passion to the point that she doesn't even say hi. Anyhow, we were at a party the other day and I decided to be civil and started talking to her. As soon as I started the conversation she said \"I don't really want to talk to you, low key\". I just said \"Okay, fair\" and literally just stood there for like 5 seconds super embarrassed and walked off and then left the party 2 minutes later. I feel like absolute shit about the whole situation. AITA? ",

I tried to talk to my best friends GF knowing that she already dislikes me? \n2. I could have maybe read the room better? Maybe I should just try and avoid her and my best friend?

Cant call you an AH for that cause you are trying to bridge the gap, and took it like a champ (\"okay, fair\") when you got shut down. Cant call her and AH cause she made it as polite (aka passive-agressive) as she could, but only told you to not talk to HER.\n\nCant be friends with everybody, but that also doesnt mean you cant be friends with everyone ELSE. \n\n\"Yeah we dont like each other, stuff happened in the past, we somehow deal with it, dont feel like talking about it rn\"",

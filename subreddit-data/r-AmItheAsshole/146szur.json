    "postText": "I (F21) am a college student. By the title, you can see I don't use Venmo. At all. Don't even have an account. I use cash all the time for everything, unless I really need to use card. \n\nThere's a lot of reasons for this, mostly because my parents monitor my bank accounts so I need to sneak things out they can't see. But cash is also convenient so I don't mind using it.\n\nThe conflict arises when my friends and I go out, and someone pays for the group at the time while others can pay them back. This avoids splitting checks and things, which I understand. But when we do this, I pay back cash. I always round up so if I owe someone $19.50 I'll give them $20, for example. To be clear, I ALWAYS pay people back immediately. I carry enough cash on me to do so. However, lately when its been my turn to pay some people haven't been paying me back because \"you don't use venmo, it would make it so much easier for us, how do you expect us to do that?\" and im like uhhhh cash? Like maybe from the cash I've been giving you to pay my portions back?\n\nLately I've straight up refused to take \"my turn\" paying for the group and have continued to ask for my money back. One friend Becca (F22) is VERY upset by this. She's been leading the charge about how \"difficult\" it is to pay me back. I don't think it is! And if it is that difficult, it's easier for me to just pay them back in cash afterwards then. They all know how I do things and why I do them, so if they \"can't\" pay me back I've said I'm happy to just pay my portion instead of putting everything on my card. I think this is a fair compromise, as I've NEVER stiffed them but some of them have stiffed me multiple times. \n\nSo, reddit AITA for not using venmo, demanding to be paid back, and refusing to pay going forward unless this is resolved?",

You may be able to open up something with very little minimum balance and no fees, or a checking account to use for venmo and a linked savings account to make some nice interest. Just don't forget after you graduate that this may roll over to \"normal\" accounts with different fees or rules. \n\nIt's a great idea to have your own bank account and learn how to use it before you're out on your own though, especially if you're used to others controlling all your finances for you.

When I first asked my lawn guy how he likes payment, suggesting Zelle or Venmo, he said \u201cnah I\u2019m easy, cash or check is fine.\u201d\n\nCool - haven\u2019t written a check in years, so that means I now have to make a separate trip to the bank just for cash just to pay this guy. If I wasn\u2019t sympathetic to his financial issues I\u2019d honestly hire someone else just to eliminate the inconvenience.",

Or even asking for a separate bill. But let\u2019s not pretend like 5 people being forced to do a half-hour errand is nothing when they\u2019re all busy \u2014 that\u2019s nearly 3 hours of effort, cumulatively!",

Transferring money from cash into your account means having to travel to a bank, which can take a decent chunk out of your day. Having to transfer it into cash, at the very least, means an ATM. Both of these things are *very* out of the way, if you don't normally use cash. The only other alternative is to have cash sitting there for god knows how long, until you have the opportunity to give it straight back to OP - which is kind of an exercise in futility, and is also kind of annoying if you don't usually keep cash. A lot of people don't even have a proper *wallet* anymore, they just keep their credit cards in their phone case.\n\nOP is essentially forcing all their friends to adjust their whole financial lifestyles to accommodate the fact that they refuse to use a card. I would honestly just make OP pay for themselves every single time, rather than deal with that song and dance.",

You are becoming the minority when it comes to carrying cash and I don't think you can expect them to change for one person. You're 21. Open a second account without your parents and don't tell them. You can do it all online. If you still live at home go paperless so they don't send any mail to the house.\n\nAlso if it's a major bank in the US you will probably have the option to Zelle use Zelle if you're not comfortable with Venmo.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (F21) am a college student. By the title, you can see I don't use Venmo. At all. Don't even have an account. I use cash all the time for everything, unless I really need to use card. \n\nThere's a lot of reasons for this, mostly because my parents monitor my bank accounts so I need to sneak things out they can't see. But cash is also convenient so I don't mind using it.\n\nThe conflict arises when my friends and I go out, and someone pays for the group at the time while others can pay them back. This avoids splitting checks and things, which I understand. But when we do this, I pay back cash. I always round up so if I owe someone $19.50 I'll give them $20, for example. To be clear, I ALWAYS pay people back immediately. I carry enough cash on me to do so. However, lately when its been my turn to pay some people haven't been paying me back because \"you don't use venmo, it would make it so much easier for us, how do you expect us to do that?\" and im like uhhhh cash? Like maybe from the cash I've been giving you to pay my portions back?\n\nLately I've straight up refused to take \"my turn\" paying for the group and have continued to ask for my money back. One friend Becca (F22) is VERY upset by this. She's been leading the charge about how \"difficult\" it is to pay me back. I don't think it is! And if it is that difficult, it's easier for me to just pay them back in cash afterwards then. They all know how I do things and why I do them, so if they \"can't\" pay me back I've said I'm happy to just pay my portion instead of putting everything on my card. I think this is a fair compromise, as I've NEVER stiffed them but some of them have stiffed me multiple times. \n\nSo, reddit AITA for not using venmo, demanding to be paid back, and refusing to pay going forward unless this is resolved?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You\u2019ve even offered alternatives that they declined, showing that you\u2019re willing to work within the boundaries you have. Definitely reasonable to only pay for your portion or to be excluded from the full bill rotation (and be an exclusively pay-it-back participant). \n\nThat being said - Venmo would actually be a useful tool for this type of expense to hide from your parents. You can set it up and get paid the back due amounts, and from there use it as needed. I do believe there are a variety of places that even accept Venmo as a payment type, so the possible reach is beyond simply getting paid back for meals. That money can also sit in your venmo account and be transferred out to a bank account later on (when your parents aren\u2019t on the account). I would recommend looking into the tool to see if it may actually benefit you.",

            "comment": "i have worked in a business that only pays cash for many years and thats generally all i have. usually when splitting any kind of bill with friends, i dont take the bill, someone who uses a card takes the bill and i pay them cash. the easy solution is just to remove yourself from the rotation of people who cover the whole bill, and always pay the person who is covering the bill in cash at the same time they are paying for the product/service - no paying anyone back at all, or to just request a separate check/pay separately when it makes sense. it depends on the situation, but ive never really had a problem doing either of these things...its never been an issue or something ive had to discuss, when it comes time to pay for something i just say \"oh ill just get a separate check, i have cash\", and if for some reason that does not make sense ill just say \"hey i have cash can someone use their card?\" and its never been an issue. \n\nthe only reason i can think of someone not being ok with this is if its a whole process to actually get paid back from all the members of the friend group. if everyone just pays up right away on their phones and its easy then it shouldnt be a problem for anyone if you want to get a separate check or have someone else use their card/phone to pay, but if youve got to constantly bother people to actually get paid, and some of these people are known to lag super hard or be full of excuses, i can see why people might not want you to escape your share of shouldering that burden, but that would be kinda a separate issue that should be addressed at its core.",

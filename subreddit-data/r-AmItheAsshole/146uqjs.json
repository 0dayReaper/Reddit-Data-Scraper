We didn\u2019t always have the best relationship but she was there. Yesterday she brought up a time when she was hurt and she thought I wasn\u2019t there for her like how she wanted me to be. For context she thought she was at first having a panic attack then thought she was having a heart attack, I went to her and asked her if she was okay and she wasn\u2019t talking, my stepdad came over and told me to move and then I went in my room, they left and I was watching my siblings till they got back but I guess she was mad that I didn\u2019t do more when I personally don\u2019t understand how much I was supposed to do in that situation. Then she said that she wanted me to care more and how she ALWAYS cared when something happened to me, I reminded her of the last few times something was actually wrong with me and she didn\u2019t care. For context (the first time) I was sick in my room and I was having trouble breathing and was trying to express to her that I couldn\u2019t breathe and she said for me to get an Uber to the hospital or tell one of my friends about it just to find out that I had covid and it could have turned into a bad situation. \nAnd the second time I just had a double ear infection still fending for myself.. at least I asked if she was okay. Plus when she had covid I kept her company and talked to her just so she would have someone to be there. But all she said in return was how I was mixing up situations in my head and how wrong I was and how she\u2019s a good mom or whatever and I could not be in her house.  She was just trying to make me feel bad for something that wasn\u2019t even true (I checked my messages and i did have covid) \nAnyways Aita for calling my mom toxic for this?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Up until the last year for almost 10 years my older brothers didn\u2019t talk after having fistfights at two back to back christmases. It really splintered the family because one isolated himself completely. And all the relationships between my family members are fragile. Me being the youngest used to be the glue, but last year when we were all finally together again in one place. One of them couldn\u2019t keep their hands to themselves so I put him in a headlock. Needless to say that destroyed my relationship with him, but we had just got back from burying my grandpa so it was pretty fucked up. We haven\u2019t spoken since. It can always be worse. Don\u2019t kill yourself over being the glue is what I learned. Communicate your feelings to them and maybe they\u2019ll be mature enough. In the case of my brother my father considers me more mature than him and he\u2019s 4 years older than me and he wasn\u2019t mature enough to accept my olive branch after 6 months. My family life sucks hard, shit my life in general kinda sucks so trust me I get it. Live for yourself and maybe they\u2019ll join you, maybe they won\u2019t. You\u2019ll never really know unfortunately until it\u2019s happened.",

My mom and brother sometimes don\u2019t get along and my brother is usually the main one that starts problems but my mom has also started things before too. We discussed travel plans in the past, and everyone agreed that going on the cruise would be best. So, we got the quote from the travel agent and decided to book it. It has only been a few days since we booked and my mom and brother are both in my ear about what could go wrong. Mostly my mom because she knows how my brother is. The past few days I have been going back-and-forth between my mom and our travel agent and I am sick of all the changes. My mom believes that my brother could ruin the trip with his attitude which is possible, but I don\u2019t care if he tries, I am going to ignore him. Now, I am thinking about just canceling the cruise all together and doing some thing else since everyone is so indecisive(mostly my mom) and issues are arising. It\u2019s really getting on my nerves that we can\u2019t come to some sort of conclusion being that we are only a three person family. It simply shouldn\u2019t be this difficult. I want everyone in attendance, because I believed that everyone would behave but now I\u2019m starting to doubt this and a huge part of me is wanting to just cancel it altogether. Would I be TA if I cancelled the trip completely and just said forget it?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

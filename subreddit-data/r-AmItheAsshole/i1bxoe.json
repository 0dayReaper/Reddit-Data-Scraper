OP should take full credit for the steps he's taken and I fully respect him for taking those steps as they must've been difficult and it would definitely have taken a lot of courage on his part. Leaving a friend group, no matter how toxic they may be, is always a hard thing to do and I respect him even more for having the courage to do this. I'm really glad that he's found and pursued new interests and hobbies! OP is fantastic",

The best of us self reflect during times of trouble, take the bull by the horns, and make changes to ourselves. Never easy, but always worth it. \n\nFor the record, I\u2019m a grin and bear it girl. I can self reflect and know what bad habits I need to change, but don\u2019t have the confidence to do it. Maybe this is the kick in the butt I need to take control of my own destiny!

They will continue showing you similar content to what you watched last so eventually you ONLY see the videos with ideas that may not be based in reality. It is hard for *anyone* much less someone with your condition to understand that even though they are seeing confirmation of a view that's not based in reality everywhere and nothing else it isn't actually the truth. It's hard for our brains to realize that bc we've evolved to find patterns.  Every single video leads to more of the same and eventually your page is so personalized that you literally will never find evidence to the contrary.\n\nThe algorithm has lead people to become radicalized by the alt-right, toxic forms of islam, conspiracies, etc. because they were curious about a subject then were relentlessly fed similar content while blocking out other views. It's effected our culture in a really negative way. Youtube was eventually (sued?), at least reported so much that they now censor content instead of changing the algorithm (cue eye roll, the algorithm makes them too much money to change it). Ironically, that backfired bc groups like the alt-right and anti-vax then claimed that the \"truth is being censored by the government\" when it was simply a liability concern. It's a mess.\n\nI've also stepped away from youtube. I feel you on that.\n\nEdit: Also your update made me cry! I also struggle with mental illness and I'm just so happy for your happiness!! I wish you continued wellness",

She now resides in a nursing home.\n\nDue to the above, I have _no idea_ what a functional schitzophrenic is like; OP (or anyone else), would you care to elaborate, even mildly?",

I was 22 when I was first diagnosed while I was in the army. At the time, I had just made sergeant and completed an army field trip. I was doing great things, my troops were killing it, and then I started hearing voices. At first I just tried to drown out the voices with alcohol, then it got to harder stuff like cocaine, molly, other 3 day drugs.  I wasn't really depressed per say. I loved life. But one day I just had enough. I had a fantastic plan. I was going to empty my bank accounts (donation to the alaskan zoo near where I was stationed and a couple of other places), eat lunch at my favorite ramen place, walk around downtown, eat at my favorite restaurant (ORSO's), and then blow my brains out down by the mudflats. I had prescheduled text messages that were supposed to send at 9 P.M to my boss that explained what I had done and that my stuff was packed up in my barracks room with letters to friends and family. One of them sent early for some reason (thank god) and he called me. I went to the hospital for a week, and was immediately ostracized, lost my position, lost my troops, and was not allowed to be near my friends. My command had no idea what to do with me, so I stayed in limbo for a few month. In those months, I had 6 attempts at going to behavioral health clinic to get medicated I finally just asked for a chapter which is when life really started after getting diagnosed.\n\nI went back to my parents for a few months, got on medication, and then moved to Arizona to be somewhere warm. It was rough. Really, really rough. I had troubles holding down jobs for 6 months, couldn't pay bills due to being broke, and ate ramen once a day for quite some time. I got a dog during that period, and thats when life really started to turn around. I made friends (group previously mentioned in last AITA), go to regular groups once a week (two times if I need it) and began working in hotels. It was a natural fit. Finding a job that I could naturally fit in and do is paramount for recovery as it gives hope for the future.",

I was thinking that, even if the events of your previous post hadn't occurred and you didn't have your diagnosis, the turnaround that you have effected over the last couple of months is amazing!

But you have been so generous with your life and circumstances, that I hope this is okay to ask. Sorry if I am treating this like \"Ask Me Anything.\" Although I think you would be an ideal candidate for that sub.\n\nAgain, congratulations on everything!",

A lot of people don't understand schizophrenia, my uncle (who is 57/58 (not sure)) is schizophrenic and i will be his caretaker if he outlives my dad.\n\nWe had a long conversation about his boundaries and what he didn't enjoy, I have full access to his medical history but i've always chosen to give him the respect of choice because he is a fully competent person and deserves respect and privacy.  He is retired from work now (he worked for his father's business from 18 to mid 40's) and your story gave me so much joy at the end.\n\ni wish you the best in life and that you never meet anyone who would do that to you again.  I hope that you and your new gf have a wonderful relationship too!!!",

It can be very hard to change your friend group even when it\u2019s toxic. \n\nYour posts don\u2019t mention if you take any medications...as a psych nurse I want to encourage you to continue taking any meds you are taking, if you are taking them, even if you are feeling \u201cnormal\u201d. This is a common problem, especially for schizophrenics, because sometimes people think they don\u2019t need their meds anymore because they\u2019re better. They forget to consider that it\u2019s the meds that are helping them feel better. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t taking meds, (heck, even if you are), ask someone to be your check-in person. If you talk regularly with someone who knows your baseline, they will be able to tell if you\u2019re starting to deviate from it negatively. \n\nHonestly, your post makes me feel so happy, and I wish you all the best!",

I've been in and out of psych wards for years and those are not places you go unless you have a reason, it's not like you want to do it, how dare they be so mean and petty?  \n\n\ngood for you getting out and finding things that work for you. long may that continue!",

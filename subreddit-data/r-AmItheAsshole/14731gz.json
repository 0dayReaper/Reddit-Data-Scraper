    "postText": "My(27f) boyfriend(30m) and I have been together going on two years and moved in together March this year. I am seriously struggling with his dog being here, even though when we had first talked about it he said he had family that the dog could go to as we moved into a small apartment not suited for a large high energy dog(boxer/German shep mix). That has not happened at all, the dog is not supposed to be here as no deposit has been paid for it and there are no plans on his side to do so. This dog barks all day long for just about anything, he\u2019s pooped and peed all over my apartment and especially in my oldest daughter\u2019s and step daughter\u2019s room. The room smells to high heaven and neither girls choose to sleep in there because it stinks so bad, even when aired out. I have no idea how to get the smell out either. I\u2019ve tried mopping, using enzymatic cleaners, as well as normal floor cleaners, but have not had any luck. Dog also has terrible terrible manners all around. He steals food from my kids if he is left out, he will take food that sits on the counter if he can reach it, he pulls on any leash no matter who\u2019s walking him, and my boyfriend or his daughter refuse to actually take care of this dog. He smells all the time, even after given a shower or bath, and if I ask for him to be showered I\u2019m met with resistance from both of them. Granted my SO is disabled and it would be genuinely hard for him to give the dog a bath since this dog again has no manners of any kind. So many times, I am the one feeding, bathing, cleaning up after, and just all around taking care of this animal that I didn\u2019t feel we should bring with us to my new place. I\u2019m struggling with all of it and feel I\u2019m being taken advantage of so I really have been feeling like since they do not want to take care of their dog, it should not be here. Would I be wrong if I were to get rid of his dog?",

Not to take it on yourself to get rid of his pet, but to make it clear to him that the status quo is not tenable, and he's going to have to make a choice of who he wants to live with.",

The dog stayed a few nights with his cousin after we moved in and I thought that was how it was going to stay but that\u2019s obviously not what happened. \nHis dog definitely had all of these issues while living at his house, but they lived in a quad building where they had a yard he could go out in and go for walks with his daughter, so using the bathroom inside was not an issue there. Now, they only want to take him out three times a day, which I feel like is too little especially since he\u2019s going in the house. \nI\u2019ve told my boyfriend many times that he needs to invest in some form of training if he plans on keeping him, but again there have been absolutely no moves made on that end either. He originally got the dog for his daughter as a birthday gift or something like that, and while they lived in another state, he felt like he was safer having his dog. I can definitely get that since they had a whole house at that time with a big backyard, but now it\u2019s not fair to your dog to be in a small apartment not being taken out enough and not fair to me that I\u2019m the one to step up and take care of this dog when I didn\u2019t sign up for that and was told he would be able to be with BF\u2019s family. \nI don\u2019t want the conflict of getting rid of his dog without his permission but I\u2019m so tired of dealing with it, especially when I could get in trouble for having the dog here since it\u2019s not on my lease and no deposit for it has been made.",

Housebroken dogs can go longer overnight (barring medical issues) but ... how the hell is your BF okay with all the poop and pee??\n\nYou shouldn't have to clean up the mess, but if you just disappear the dog into the cornfield he might just get a new one.\n\nCould you set a deadline? \"The current situation isn't healthy for anyone; you have two weeks to get the dog to a new place and if he's still here by the 24th I will be taking him to a shelter\"",

She would let the pee seep under our flooring and not clean it up at all even after being told about it, and this was all before my daughter came to live with us. I personally have mopped and scrubbed the laminate floors multiple times and have a regular schedule of doing so at least two times a week for the whole house but the smell will not leave that room. Before my daughter moved in completely she had a bed that was for her in that room but the dog ended up peeing and pooping all over it so she sleeps on the couch in the living room until her new bed comes.   It\u2019s a difficult situation because I have brought up many times that he should be trained but training is expensive and not only that but they wouldn\u2019t put forth the effort to really train him. I\u2019m sure they would expect me to be the one to continue the training through the week after a session with a trainer, which I am just unwilling to do. I work, go to school, and have my own kids to take care of and my apartment to clean. I am too busy to deal with a dog that I didn\u2019t want there in the first place",

I work with animal rescue so I'm seeing this situation from that lens.  I've had German Shepherds, I've had a boxer.  I've fostered a couple of boxer/GSD mixes.   That's A LOT of dog in a large, muscular, high energy package.  Far too many able bodied people with houses and fenced yards are not equipped for that kind of dog.  Clearly the dog is not getting sufficient stimulation, exercise, training, rules or boundaries and his quality of life clearly not good.  I'm sure he and his daughter are attached to the dog, they believe they love of the dog.  But true love isn't selfish or abusive.  Their version of love is  sacrificing the animal's physical and mental well being on the alter of their emotional attachment.  That isn't healthy for them and it's certainly not healthy for the dog.  Hopefully this dog is young enough that he can be successfully rehomed to someone who can actually provide for his needs.  But longer this goes on, the more likely it is to end in tragedy for this poor dog who doesn't deserve this life.\n\nA couple of other thoughts:\n\nA dog that still stinks after a bath likely has a medical issue that needs to be addressed.  When is the last time this dog went to the vet?\n\nThe fact that he's willing to have either of the girls live in that unsanitary environment does speak well of him as a father or a partner.",

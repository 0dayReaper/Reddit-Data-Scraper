    "postText": "I (37F) gave birth to my and my husband\u2019s (45M) second baby four months ago\u2026my husband is white Jewish and I\u2019m South Asian (relevant). \n\nWhile I was in the hospital giving birth, I found out later that my FIL was sending my husband threatening emails demanding that we give the baby a white Jewish name\u2026he wrote things like \u201cif you don\u2019t do this for me, you can consider our relationship over\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t understand why my grandchild should have a pagan Hindu name\u201d and \u201ca [my heritage] middle name would be fine.\u201d\n\nIn a later email he wrote, \u201cso babynamedebacle wins again.\u201d\n\nSome info: our babies\u2019 names are picked according to my country\u2019s cosmology\u2026my religion is not Hindu, which the FIL knows\u2014my language just happen to share a root language with Hindi. My husband has never suggested a Jewish name for either baby and I had no idea FIL asked for this with the first baby before demanding it for the second. When asked, husband said he didn\u2019t have strong feelings about the baby names and liked/knew my naming tradition was important for me. \n\nAll my family live in my home country and just before my labor, my mother was denied a travel visa to be here for my baby\u2019s birth, which has been hugely traumatic as I already have a traumatic visa history in the U.S\u2026also, my mother was present for my first child\u2019s birth for 6 months and helped with childcare and cooking and was a huge support. \n\nIn contrast, the FIL and MIL never watched the first baby when we visited them, even demanding we come back in an hour when we once asked to go for a walk while the baby was sleeping. \n\nMy husband is hugely conflict avoidant and essentially placated FIL (as does everyone in their immediately family). I don\u2019t have a good relationship with FIL as he often says racism/sexism-flavored and generally unpleasant and aggressive things. In our first meeting, he claimed \u201cArabs are the most murderous people in the world\u201d and it\u2019s pretty much gotten worse since then.  \n\nMy husband and I have been married for 12 years. My first child is now 3 and we are struggling to work and parent both without my mom\u2019s support.\n\nWhen my husband finally confronted FIL re name debacle, the FIL refused to apologize for demeaning our relationship/my character/background and said the issue had \u201cnothing to do with babynamedebacle\u201d as if I\u2019m a womb for hire to preserve his heritage and have been scheming to pick names against husband\u2019s will. \n\nNow FIL wants us to drive 5-6 hours with breastfeeding infant and toddler to visit them instead of coming to us to see baby. He is able bodied and moneyed. He offered to get us a limo to bring us to him, which he could take himself. AITA for not wanting to go? (I\u2019ve offered the decision to be my husband\u2019s choice and he\u2019s electing not to go.)\n\nEdit: clarified the quality of FIL\u2019s racism.",

Edit: they regularly complain husband doesn\u2019t call/visit enough and undoubtedly blame me for it. \n\nI feel guilty too because I know firsthand the pain of being separated from grandparents. He said he thinks \u201cwe should go\u201d but doesn\u2019t want to, I think, partly because of my feelings but more because he hates conflict and is passive. \n\nAlso, the in laws may have an expectation that we would visit them because husband\u2019s sister makes a trip across the world to visit them with her three kids. Her husband often doesn\u2019t come because it\u2019s so stressful. It\u2019s always incredibly stressful as the house is super not child-friendly and the in laws are neurotic and rigid. FIL has more than once asked sister to \u201cshut the toddler up\u201d as if you can. Sister in law describes trips as \u201calways a nightmare.\u201d",

For one, FIL helps with housing/daycare costs. \n\nThey have neither patience, interest, or capacity to help with childcare directly but they think they\u2019re very loving e.g. about three weeks after I gave birth they sent a custom robe for me\u2026as if I needed a robe, I needed my mom or money for childcare or family around.\n\nI said a quick thanks and left it at that and the in-laws complained I was \u201ccold\u201d and FIL said I didn\u2019t say anything about the present even though he put a lot of thought into it and it upset him\u2026I literally had just given birth and was in the trenches with two kids under three, plus fighting constantly with my husband because of his lack of support in telling FIL to step back and not defending me.",

He needs to establish clear boundaries and if they are not respected, you both will go no contact. The first boundary should be respect for your family, your culture and your heritage. And that\u2019s the bare minimum!\n\nHave you talked to your husband about how all of your FIL\u2019s behaviours and actions affect you? Maybe start from there - be firm in telling him what you want and what the potential consequences for your relationship would be. Make sure that it is him who has to establish these boundaries with his father, not you. Good luck!",

You said he might be narcissistic, so he\u2019s also not going to change.

My husband has never suggested a Jewish name for either baby and I had no idea FIL asked for this with the first baby before demanding it for the second. When asked, husband said he didn\u2019t have strong feelings about the baby names and and liked and knew knew my naming tradition was important for me. \n\nAll my family live in my home country and just before birth my mother was unjustly denied a travel visa to be there for my baby\u2019s birth which has been hugely traumatic as I always have a traumatic visa history in the U.S\u2026also, my mother was present for my first child\u2019s birth for 6 months and helps with childcare and cooking and is a huge support. \n\nIn contrast, the FIL and MIL never watched the first baby, even demanding we come back in an hour when we asked to once go for a walk while the baby was sleeping. \n\nMy husband is hugely conflict avoidant and essentially placated FIL (as does everyone in their immediately family). I don\u2019t have a good relationship with him as he often says hugely racist/sexist/generally unpleasant and aggressive things. In our first meeting, he claimed \u201cArabs are the most murderous people in the world\u201d and it\u2019s pretty much gotten worse since then.  \n\nMy husband and I have been married for 12 years. My first child is now 3 and we are struggling to work and parent both without my mom\u2019s support.\n\nWhen my husband finally confronted FIL the FIL refused to apologize for demeaning our relationship/my character/background and said the issue had \u201cnothing to do with babydebacle name\u201d as if I\u2019m a womb for hire to preserve his heritage and have been scheming to pick names against husband\u2019s will. \n\nNow he wants us to drive 5-6 hours with breastfeeding newborn and toddler to visit them instead of coming to us to see newborn. He is able bodied and moneyed. He offered to get us a limo to bring us which he could take himself. AITA for not wanting to go? (I\u2019ve said it\u2019s my husbands choice and he\u2019s electing not to go.)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It took my husband years to see it. When I first said FIL was racist, husband was furious and insisted \u201che\u2019s bigoted, not racist.\u201d\n\nTbh, being in their family orbit makes me doubt myself so I\u2019m here hoping for clear-eyed views.",

Traditionally, gifts after childbirth are usually geared towards the baby, not the parents. That's just my perspective.",

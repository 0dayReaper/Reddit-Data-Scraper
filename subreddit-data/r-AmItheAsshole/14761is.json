    "postText": "Context:\n\nAbout 9 months ago, my biological dads family decided to reach out &amp; let me know that I have a different dad. This infuriated my mom who then didn\u2019t want me to contact any of them without her &amp; my now step-dad as a mediator. I didn\u2019t think that was healthy, &amp; decided to start my own relationships with everybody (which have been great). I was kept in a facade my entire life, &amp; likely still would be if it was her choice.\n\nMy mom has claimed that he was very abusive to her. I heard my dads side, &amp; he said that they were both abusive, but that doesn\u2019t make it okay. He apologized &amp; said I could always come to him with any questions. I didn\u2019t have any because I won\u2019t ever remember these things due to being less than 1 y/o. He hasn\u2019t mentioned it since. My mom on the other hand continuously bashes him. It\u2019s hard for me to believe her due to her being abusive to me. It wasn\u2019t the worst forms of abuse, but I did have hot drinks/ food thrown at me, would get slapped, &amp; verbally abused on a constant basis after I turned about 15. She still gaslights &amp; is verbally abusive to me. \n\nI hadn\u2019t seen her after this happened until last week due to living in different states. She went on taking some jabs at him in conversations on my free day we were supposed to go to the zoo with my grandma. I asked nicely if she could just not mention him when around me. She immediately started screaming &amp; crying saying I was silencing an abuse victim. I kept my calm because I know that\u2019s the best thing to do with her. I said it wasn\u2019t fair to put me in the middle of it, &amp; that I just wanted a nice day with no drama. She kept screaming and told my grandma to shut the fuck up after she (gma) said she understands my view. I told her not to say that to her, which resulted in me being told the same. She continued on about how she had been silenced for 21 years, &amp; I said that was her choice. She could\u2019ve gotten therapy, &amp; still can. I just don\u2019t find it fair to make me that therapist. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to believe, but either way I don\u2019t want to be forced to choose her side in order to have a \u201chealthy\u201d relationship. Should I be more supportive, or should I be okay with having a positive relationship with my biological dad at the expense of her wishes/ our relationship?\n\nEdit: She can be very loving. She just has moments where she blows up. I do understand it would be hard to keep this secret, &amp; in her mind she thought it was best. I imagine it was a lot of trauma no matter what the situation was. Should I be more accepting &amp; supportive regardless any personal past?",

I think she feels offended that I\u2019m not siding with her when I have known her my whole life vs. someone I have known for less than a year.

Examples are using the wrong persons name, a similar but not correct name. I.E name is Joe so you call them John etc. \n\nSo yesterday I asked him why it was only an issue using the correct name for people of a different skin tone. The individual got very upset and ended up leaving early. Our interaction was not confrontational I didn\u2019t yell or scream etc. I simply  stated that my observation was he had issues with one group but not the other and asked why that might be the case.   My coworker responded with he had never been corrected before (I know this is a lie I have watched someone correct him at least 3 times in the past 2 weeks)\n\nObviously this upset my co worker so much they left early and today I am wondering if I was out of line for sayin something.   Multiple people witnessed this interaction and nobody said it was an over the top accusation. \n\nDetail: nobody has an overly unique name most of us have pretty generic names for where we leave so I don\u2019t think simple mispronunciation was the issue.",

So the whole topic of names is going to be bound up with the stress of this accusation, which certainly isn't going to help him remember.\n\nBtw, to say \"I simply stated that my observation was he had issues with one group but not the other and asked why that might be the case\" is to not take credit for what you were obviously doing, which was suggesting that he was a racist. You may not have had a confrontational tone, but a \"simple statement\" and question like that pack a punch.\n\nHonestly, I don't know where to fall on this. Calling him out didn't help the situation, but it would be hard to call you TA for bringing up what is pretty likely a sign of racism.",

For context her child's birthday was on the Sunday, but she's planned to have the party on the Monday.\nI've recently had a promotion at work which has lead to extra hours and because my senior has left I've been thrown in the deep end with her responsibilities as well as my own, so understandably I am tired after every shift. Due to this promotion and my boyfriend also getting one at the same time, we've not seen eachother or spent much time together in the past couple of weeks and we both miss eachother.\nI finish an hour earlier than my co worker tomorrow and I planned to spend that time after work going to the gym and being with my boyfriend who has the day off.\nI know that it's kind of mean to say no, however it's my only early finish of the week and I already had plans so, aita?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You made that happen because you also have plans in your mind (regardless if it\u2019s menial things or not-so important things).\n\nI understand that she has a birthday party to prepare. Good thing she asked, but you saying no to her does not make you TA. She should just deal with it, finish the work and rush home.\n\nIf it\u2019s any consolation, it\u2019s gonna be the same scenario anyways (same time to finish work for her) if she had no choice.",

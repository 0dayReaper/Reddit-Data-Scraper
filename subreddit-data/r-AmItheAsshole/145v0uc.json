My thought is that at least Cara and likely Brenda and Darren aren't the kind of friends you thought they were, and that at least Cara has a superannuated mean girl thing going; excluding one member of a class who has already extended themselves for you is a definite mean girl move.  Maybe look for some better friends who are worthier of your time and effot.",

She told him the party was canceled and they were doing a girl's night, in effect, telling him no.  \n\n\nLater, they have another party that he *also* isn't invited to. They never invited him, so there was no reason to tell him. He saw a post about the party later and was annoyed that he wasn't invited. Just because he invited himself to the first one, and had a tentative yes until it was canceled, that doesn't entitle him to an invite to the second one.",

Also from what I remember in the post, could be mistaken, they didn't confirm plans with him until the day prior either. They fact they excluded him from the next one makes me guess it was planned and/or they didn't want him there anyway. They're the AH's imo for not being direct. Even if it was that they don't want him there or see them as their friend... Just act like an adult and be honest. It can hurt someone but spare them a lot more hurt in the future.\n\nI don't want to call OP the AH because tbh he sounds like a naive kid who's not found his people yet but is trying to make connections. (also based on him buying food to bring without it even being confirmed he's invited, sounds like he's trying to fit in). But I don't have enough info and could be wrong, he could be a huge AH which is why they didn't want him there. You never really know the full story on AITA.",

You're saying they are the assholes because they weren't direct? How so? They were completely direct. Cara said she was okay with him going, but it wasn't just her dinner so she had to ask the others. It is far more likely that Darren told them he was going home, so Brenda (who he admits he doesn't know very well) and Cara decide to do their own thing. They then tell him so. End of that portion of the story.   \n\n\nLater, they have a new party with more people, but don't invite him. They don't have to invite him to every dinner just because he invited himself along to the first one.  \n\n\nAnd yes, they told him there was no dinner the day before.

People who have to see and interact with you on a regular basis are not obligated to be friends with you. The invite list for social events outside of school is at the sole discretion of the party host. \n\nYou *asked* to be invited to the first planned party; you were not invited. The original party didn\u2019t happen, and then another replacement party did. You were not told about the second party because you already tried to invite yourself to the original party when you weren\u2019t asked to begin with. The fact that you mention the Thanksgiving party at all seems to indicate that you feel \u201cowed\u201d an invitation to the NYE party, but that\u2019s not how party invitations (or friendship) works. \n\nIt seems clear to me that your fellow students didn\u2019t want to include you in their NYE celebration for a reason; whether or not they have a *good* reason to not want to be friends with you outside of school is irrelevant; either they\u2019re uncomfortable hanging out with you, or they\u2019re excluding you for no good reason because they\u2019re just jerks. Either way, these are not your friends.\n\nThe fact that this unrelated person (Edgar) felt the need to make this post tells me that unintentionally or not, you were causing drama amongst your classmates and pushing in where you aren\u2019t wanted. You felt excluded and that sucks; but if multiple people are now telling you they feel uncomfortable, especially people who weren\u2019t involved in any of the parties to begin with, then this social issue is now affecting school. And it sounds like you\u2019re the one who keeps bringing it up and making everyone uncomfortable. So stop bringing it up, please.",

The old rule was that you had six months or so to host in return, but in today\u2019s quicker-paced world, it is probably best to keep it to four or five months \u2014 if you want the friendship to survive, of course.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cRemember, it\u2019s like for like.

And when they had spoken about it with them you said you're 'agnostic' towards it, which is a really weird thing to say about New Year's, and them asking you about it then was in no way an actual invitation. \n\nIt can be hurtful and uncomfortable when you know people don't like you that much or want you around, but they did their best to minimise your discomfort and hurt without compromising their own comfort of not having to be around you.

And if they did, they had a stereotypical view. Autistics are men who are socially awkward and super smart. People with ADHD just can\u2019t focus\n\nPeople didn\u2019t know the actual symptoms. Like being late all the time despite your best efforts. So many people don\u2019t know that\u2019s a symptom not someone being an asshole. \n\nWhen I would start acting really autistic it was making people uncomfortable and destroyed a ton of relationships. The issue was the not only did the people around me not know I was autistic, but I didn\u2019t either! It\u2019s wasn\u2019t ableist bc none of us knew. When I found out after and confided in friends they were a lot more understanding of certain behaviors. After that when people would be weird/make us uncomfortable, instead of writing them off some of my friends *were* like hey maybe this person is neurodivergent? It actually led to chats with some people expressly explaining behaviors. \n\nI used to hold the same view when I was the \u201cvictim\u201d of the scenario. I thought it was mean and I was being bullied. I wasn\u2019t. I made a lot of people uncomfortable/was unintentionally mean. And these poor teenagers/college students/young people were put in a really uncomfortable position with out at all knowing my intentions or even really having the maturity to deal with it. I doubt they were thinking I was neurodivergent and choosing to be able-ist. They\u2019re just trying to respond in the best way to protect themselves \n\nAlso as a black woman, personally I would put myself in a lot of danger if I chose to see weird behavior as \u201coh maybe they just can\u2019t read social cues\u201d. We don\u2019t live in a world where that\u2019s safe to do. I\u2019ve stupidly done it before with men and I\u2019ve done it before with racists and it turned out there were no issues with social cues, that person was reasonably considered creepy/uncomfortable/off",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nTo set up the context, I am a graduate student in a small department. During Thanksgiving, I invited my classmates who stayed in town over for dinner, including one classmate who I will refer to as Cara. For reference, another classmate, Brenda, was also in town by did not join for Thanksgiving.\n\nFast forward a few months later, I heard Cara, Brenda, and another classmate Darren were arranging a holiday dinner for the New Years. I asked Cara if I could join, and Cara said sure but would have to check with Brenda and Darren first.\n\nA few days pass, I hear back from Cara saying that Darren had changed plans and was going back to visit their family. Since Darren was leaving, Brenda and Cara decided to do a girls night instead. This happened the day before the scheduled dinner. I was disappointed, especially since I had already purchased some food to bring for the dinner, but did not challenge their decision.\n\nThen a month later, I heard from Brenda that Brenda, Cara, Darren, and two additional classmates had a New Years dinner. Confused about this situation, I asked Cara to clarify what happened during New Years. Cara told me that she and Brenda had a girls night and then on the following week, Brenda arranged a dinner with the rest of the classmates. What irritated me was that Brenda had referred to this dinner as a New Years dinner, so in my mind it seem like they had simply moved the original plans without letting me know. I mentioned to Cara that I felt excluded especially since most of my classmates were invited.\n\nA few days after, another classmate, Edgar, who did not attend any of the outings, wrote a public post telling everyone to mind their own business and not to make other people uncomfortable. I confronted Edgar about their post privately saying they shouldn't make blanket statements. Edgar told me that Cara had told him that I had made her uncomfortable by asking about the dinner.\n\nTo summarize, AITA for asking my friend to clarify what happened? I understand that people are entitled to do whatever social activities with whomever they want and accept that. But I felt particularly hurt by Edgar making a public statement, especially as they were not involved with any of the events.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But I\u2019d just leave things be and figure out who you ARE close with and in what way. I think you may have just overestimated how friendly you all are as a group and that\u2019s okay!",

But, while it is unfortunate, these people do not consider you to be their friend, probably just a person they can use in case of emergencies. \nAs many comments pointed it out, probably you just didn't bond well with each other. However, just because I can't vibe well with someone, doesn't mean that person doesn't have any value. \nBesides, many comments already pointed out that, Brenda probably doesn't like you, then why did she tell you about it, specifically terming it as 'New Year's dinners'? Again, according to Edgar, it wasn't Brenda who felt uncomfortable, it was Cara. Looks like Cara is the one whose trying to avoid you. Moreover, you were hurt because MOST of your classmates were invited. It wasn't a party between 3-4 close friends, it was almost the whole class. So, you have a right to be upset.\nSometimes we can't form good relationships with people, albeit it's sad, it's fine. But disrespecting people like this isn't.\nGo find better friends or people who, at the very least, respect you.",

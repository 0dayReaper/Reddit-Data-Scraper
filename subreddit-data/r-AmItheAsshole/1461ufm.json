    "postText": "I (23F) gave my sister the shirt my MIL (55F) gifted me because it wasn\u2019t fitting me right. \n\nMy MIL found out during a dinner we were having. \nShe saw me and expressed how surprised she was that I wasn\u2019t wearing the shirt she bought me, I told her I gave it to my sister because it was too small for me\n\nThat surprised her even more and she asked why I didn\u2019t made sure she was okay with it first, I said I didn\u2019t because 1) she doesn\u2019t have the ticket so it\u2019s not like we could\u2019ve returned it and 2) I, maybe wrongly, assumed that since she gifted the shirt to me, I was deciding what to do with it. \n\nShe got mad and thought I was lying to not admit I just didn\u2019t like the shirt.\nI told her no that\u2019s not why, you can even ask your son he was there when I tried it on\n\nShe refused and said it didn\u2019t matter and wasn\u2019t a big deal but I can tell by the way she acts that she\u2019s still bothered by me giving the shirt away\n\nAITA",

Instead of fixing it she threw it out and bought a new shift that didn't look remotely close to it. Only thing it had in common was that it was navy blue. The shirt I had was tight at the top and baggy/flowy in the abdomen. That was important to me. New shirt was baggy to the point I couldn't wear a bra without it being the main shirt and then it tied up over the stomach and was short. I have a stomach that sticks out so it looked like a broken balloon on me. Like it was trying to highlight my insecurities. \n\nMonth after she bought it and I had never worn it out, my friend tells me her girlfriends transition is at the point where she feels comfortable enough to start wearing woman's clothes. Her girlfriend hates spending money so we thought we'd surprise her by raiding our closets for clothes we didn't mind parting with. My partner mentioned it to his mom and she pulled a few items from her closet for our friend too. \n\nYes I gave her the new shirt. It was fugly on me and it looks great on my friend. She loves it. \n\nMIL went to my friends work while she wore it and put 2 and 2 together :/",

In her it manifested as her being controlling, like OP's MIL is trying to be here. Being super focused on what other people do is not healthy. My mom bought me countless items as gifts that I never wanted, asked for, or were able to use. I held onto them for YEARS and felt extreme guilt over giving anything away. In fact, the May 20th Dear Abby letter is from me. Both she and multiple therapists have assured me it is perfectly fine to give away gifts that don't work for you. \n\nPlain and simple, it's not rude to give away a gift that doesn't work for you. By that logic we'd never be able to give away most of our stuff and most things we end up with that don't function for us arrived as well intended gifts.\n\nNo, if a friend put the shirt on their dog I'd be glad it got put to use instead of sitting in their closet. But nonetheless, OP's sister and a dog are not an equal comparison. OP gave it to someone she loves, the gift was not wasted.",

Especially your sister, which keeps it in the family.\n\nI also feel like it\u2019s reasonable for MIL to be a bit saddened by it. She\u2019s probably blaming herself for buying the wrong size, but can\u2019t convey that fact to others.\n\nSince MIL wants to drop it, I\u2019d let it go. Just a small bump in the road.",

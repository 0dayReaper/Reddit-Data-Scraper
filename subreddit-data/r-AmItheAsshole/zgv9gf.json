They're smart enough to know how to cause real damage, but don't have the life experience to really understand the scope of what they're doing. Idk about yall but I'd never had more than a couple hundred dollars at once in high school, I couldn't really have understood how much $20,000 is in the real world. \n\nThings like this can help them understand the scope, and maybe, just maybe, teach them a lesson *without* ruining their life.",

Luckily BIL handled it like an adult and a parent. And I agree with you that there's likely jealous on OP's sister's part.

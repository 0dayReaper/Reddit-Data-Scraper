If this a was via text, and depending the wording, I can see your friend taking the \"don't worry about it, I'll do laundry\" response as you bitching. If i was via phone call, maybe the tone of your voice made him think you were mad.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nIt\u2019s a small issue that could\u2019ve easily been prevented, but he\u2019s blowing it way out of proportion. It matters cause he\u2019s my best friend (26M). He happened to be in the mall to watch the cinema with some fellow classmates while I (25M) decided to wait at the hospital (we\u2019re medical students) to take care of some patients. They were to come to the hospital afterwards.\n\nI realized I didn\u2019t have enough underwear brought in my apartment after coming back from vacation, so I messaged him to purchase me some at the mall if he happens to still be there. He told me that he would, but eventually he had dinner for too long to reach the store, which had already closed. He called to apologize and tell me he could buy some disposable underwear at 7-11, but I told him not to and that I could manage doing extra laundry at the apartment. It really wasn\u2019t a big deal. And I didn\u2019t want him to go out of his way just for that. \n\nSome classmates who were with him eventually came back without him, and I asked where he was. And he was apparently out nearby still trying to find me underwear from 7-11. I messaged him again not to do it and gave 3 missed calls. He eventually called 10 minutes later saying he was almost at the counter in 7-11, close to purchasing the disposables. \n\nI don\u2019t know why he was so insistent on purchasing them (even saying that he\u2019d buy them regardless if I\u2019d wear them or not). After back and forth of his insistence and my telling him not to do it, he gave in but was really annoyed. Since then he\u2019s been ignoring me. It\u2019s been almost 2 weeks. \n\nI apologized immediately after it happened but he only told me he was full of hate. He said I made him feel full of sh*t and was hurt. He didn\u2019t tell me why exactly, but I apologized regardless. He never put my next apology message on read and has ignored me ever since. \n\nI know it sounds so petty, but this guy\u2019s my best friend. And I have no idea if I was being an as*hole for this.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is indeed a strange feeling to recognise attractiveness outside of your \"dating pool\" age group, whether it be younger or older, but if we have eyes and a brain capable of recognising beauty and aesthetics, it makes sense that it may happen. \n\n\n\nIn most situations where it happens I find myself thinking \"wow that's an attractive young woman, I'm sure she has to fend off a lot of unwanted attention\" or \"what a handsome salt &amp; pepper man, I hope his personality is as charming as his looks\" not for myself but for themselves or the people in their age group. I haven't wished to be a different age but I have sometimes thought \"Woah if teen me had met this guy today I would've definitely developed a crush on him\" \n\n\n\nHowever with every passing year people 5-10 years younger than me already have me think \"Ahww, baby, child. You have so much to learn still, so much to see of the world, I remember being in your shoes\" because honestly? In your 20s and 30s you grow up so much, every year really counts. Twice or half my age is unthinkable, ESPECIALLY if there were children of similar ages involved.",

Come on now. Unless this woman was incredibly sheltered or is developmentally delayed, she's old enough to make her own choices about who she dates even if we cannot see the appeal.\n\nAlso, they were 24 and 48 when they started dating, not when they got married. Big difference between your situation and theirs.\n\nEdit so that I don't get even more comments about this: the oft-quoted factoid that brains are not developed until 25 has no true scientific backing in the neurological research community. There is one part of the brain that stabilizes around the mid-20s, but no neuroscientist is going to tell you that there is a hard age for when that happens or that it means that a person isn't an adult until it happens. https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/brain-development-25-year-old-mature-myth.html",

I really do sympathize because my mother was the parent in this same exact scenario in my life, it is just creepy. Your dad out of the blue wanting his actual child that there is little to no relationship with to be his best man in this dumpster fire is just the cherry on top. It's likely just to make his appearance amongst his friends look like his kid is all on board with his creepy choices.

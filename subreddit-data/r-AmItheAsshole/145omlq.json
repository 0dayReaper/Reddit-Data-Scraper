    "postText": "So here's so more insight, Me and my girlfriend are 18 we both moved with her parents to michigan with the promise of a better living area, Her mom had promised to kick out her dead beat dad and also said she had a job lined up, I transferred from my previous workplace to a new site and was to start as soon as we got there after we'd made it there her mom had decided to backstab us on the whole kicking out part and then also drop the news that she didn't have a job lined up therefor they'd require every single paycheck I needed to keep a roof over our head, Now me and my girlfriend both work she works two jobs I work one with another job lined up we'd given her mother our paychecks and we would've had enough to get by with rent again if she hadn't gone and blown it on shoes which she didn't even need, Then my girlfriend and her mom went out tonight and they had a conversation pertaining my interview tomorrow and how in the text it says \"Up to 17 an hour\" and her mom said \"Even if it doesn't pay 17 he still better accept it\" like it's not my fault you wasted money that's not even yours to waste on shoes rather then rent, I want to buy a car I want to buy a ring for my gf and she is sucking the life out of us so I told my girlfriend \"If she really needs the money that bad she can work too and if we need the money that bad don't go and spend 500$ on shoes you don't even need, Also on a side note her mom basically stays in bed all day.",

Get yourself a place. Make sure it\u2019s a place you can afford on your own (because you are signing a legal lease to pay it, and you cannot right now rely on your GF\u2019s income), and do NOT ever, EVER, let them stay with you, even if it\u2019s an emergency, or just for a few nights. They\u2019ll never leave, and you\u2019ll be on the lease AND stuck with them.\n\nDon\u2019t give them money anymore. Pay any portion of rent directly yourself (ie direct to the landlord, and you aren\u2019t paying it ALL are you?!). Pay any groceries with your own card. No more cash for them. Until you\u2019ve saved up your own moving out money. Your girlfriend can feel the burn of having hard earnt money squandered by them if she\u2019s daft enough to give them cash.\n\nI don\u2019t have enough info on your girlfriends attitude towards this, but if your GF is ok with you being stuck with the bills, and her mum blowing $500 on shoes\u2026 then your GF sounds like she doesn\u2019t have good money skills either, at which point you should island/isolate your money off from her too, and protect it, at least until you are more than a year financially independent of her family and there\u2019s slowly rebuilt trust around how money is allocated in the relationship.  \n\n\nEdit to add: FInancial abuse definition: [https://www.wire.org.au/financial-abuse/](https://www.wire.org.au/financial-abuse/)   they are controlling how the money is being spent, they\u2019ve moved you (with false promises) to a place you no Longer feel safe/secure/have separated you from your support network, they are threatening your housing.. this is a form of Domestic Violence. Just because they havne\u2019t signed your name on a contract or bank loan yet\u2026 or haven\u2019t yet sold your stuff\u2026 doesn\u2019t mean the other stuff doesn\u2019t apply.

Not sure what rent is in your area, but a room rental or small 1 bedroom place is probably cheaper and if you\u2019re working 2 jobs, it shouldn\u2019t take much of any more to be able to afford your own place. It will probably be cheaper.  \nAt what point did girlfriend get a job?  Because she should have started looking and getting one right away, especially once she found out mom lied.  \nIt almost sounds like they trapped you knowing that your work ethic is too good to let them down. They moved you from family to isolate  you. Not easy to move back home when home is so far away. \nNTA for telling your girlfriend that it\u2019s a shitty situation.",

Honestly, it was awesome. I took her bowling, to get a manicure, becoming Disney princesses(I looked awesome as Jasmine), and so forth. She loved it. I loved it. Everyone was happy. Then we decided to go out to eat dinner. \u201cI\u2019m starving, what do you want Maddie?\u201d \u201cHi Starving, I\u2019m not your daughter\u201d. She had this biggest smirk on her face. She hugged me and I kissed her forehead. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d been planning this for weeks.\n \nOriginal post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dhfeg9/aita_for_making_a_dad_joke/",

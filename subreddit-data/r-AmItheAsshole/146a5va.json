That\u2019s absolutely your choice. But YTA and insanely immature for taking to the internet to bitch about your family, how could you not possibly think that would get back to them? \n\nJust block the problem people and move on, you\u2019ve now stooped to their level and look like the bad guy when you could\u2019ve not made family drama public on the internet like a 14 year old (whether or not you were the one who did it first.) you also published information about a potentially abused minor and made THEIR private trauma public. Not only that but you questioned their potential victimhood. You\u2019re a demon. \n\nETA: your brother is also TA MAJORLY for taking to the internet with concerns of literal child harm instead of getting his child checked out and reporting it to the authorities. (And continuing to bring his child around the accused.)",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo for the past two years I haven\u2019t spoken to my mother after she made my pregnancy announcement all about her and called me to tell me off. Since then I\u2019ve seen my mother twice. Once at a cousins wedding (we didn\u2019t speak) and the last time at my great grandfathers funeral (she came up to me and hugged me and then begin to say we need to fix things) I told her that wasn\u2019t the place to hash things out and she got upset with me. \n\nJanuary of this year my younger sister had open heart surgery and my mother messaged me on Facebook to tell me how her surgery went but in the same message tried to gaslight me telling me she hopes I stop denying their love for me. I won\u2019t lie I messaged her back and told her exactly why she\u2019s blocked on everything and when I shared a few of the issues I have with her she said she didn\u2019t care to hear the issues I have and that she forgives me. I told her until she could take responsibility for her treatment towards me I have nothing further to say because it would fall on deaf ears and I blocked her on Facebook.\n\nFast forward to just recently I found out from a family member that one of my brothers who has come over a few times to visit my sons is only doing so to try to find out whatever he can about our lives and report back to my mother. It upset me and since I use my Facebook as a journal of sorts I wrote out my frustration at finding out my brother isn\u2019t visiting because he wants to see his nephews.\n\nWell my other brother decided to bash me on Facebook and accuse me of hating my mom and then accused our grandfather (our moms father) of being inappropriate with my younger sister (but they still ALL regularly visit him). A few family members called me about his post shocked so I made a response and attached every single screenshot between me and my parents and all of my siblings. And I asked why if my grandfather did what they\u2019re claiming he did why are they allowing him around her? I then called my grandparents to inform them of what they are accusing them of.\n\nMy grandparents immediately called my mother to find out wtf is her deal to throw such a serious accusation their way. My grandma said my mom got pissed at me for telling her anything and then corrected herself saying that my grandpa hugged my younger sister too tightly and hurt her neck and that they misspoke and she was going to have my brother correct his post.\n\nAfter 15+ years of dealing with my mothers narcissistic ways and my dad just enabling her toxic behavior and all of my siblings ganging up on me in their own ways from time to time it felt freeing to finally put SOME of the truth out there. I\u2019m just wondering if maybe I went a tad far in exposing my siblings as well. Thank you for reading.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We were together 7 years and he got into heavy drugs and became abusive towards the end of our relationship. \n\nWe have a beautiful 3.5-year-old he hasn't seen since she was barely a year old. I've been with my current partner 3 years now and he's been raising her and we're actually expecting our second daughter together in late August/early September. \n\nBut ex's family absolutely does not hold him accountable. They actually blamed ME for his drug addiction, refused to get him help, and backed him up on being a deadbeat dad. \n\nIt was refreshing to see your post about your cousin and holding him accountable; I wish more people were like that.",

I had a restraining order against him and full custody; he was only allowed supervised visitations which he felt he shouldn't have to pay for (so he didn't). Instead he'd continuously violate the restraining order by showing up to my parent's house or texting me to see her. I'd always remind him he's violating the order and needs to go through the method the court ordered. Then he'd disappear for months and then repeat the process. I finally moved 2500 miles away with my new partner. I was required to give him notice and a chance to dispute it (he didn't). It wasn't until AFTER I was in the process of moving I got served with papers contesting the move and demanding partial custody THREE months after the move was approved (he never even bothered to show up to court. He hadn't seen her in 2 years and never proved to the courts he got help for his drug addiction, the entire reason he couldn't have custody in the first place). Needless to say he didn't win the court case and I haven't heard from him since (that was 4 months ago). The mediator even wrote in her report she thinks he only took me to court to spite me (probably true). \n\nWe are happy and doing well, though! My current boyfriend is amazingly sweet, we are so excited about welcoming Baby Girl # 2 into our little family, and I just got a new job that pays well and so far I enjoy it. My daughter calls my boyfriend her daddy. We never taught her to do that, she just randomly made that decision on her own. She would not recognize my ex if he walked past us on the street. I'm sure the day will come when she will be curious about him, but I've been preparing myself to cross that bridge when we actually get there.",

Yes honestly when his mother told me she didn't need to have a relationship with my daughter (her only grandchild) because - and I quote - \"My children will give me more\", and my ex backed her up...I knew it'd be best for my daughter to not have any contact with any of them. Not one person in that family had ever reached out to see her except his little brother, but then I found out it was my ex pushing the brother to \"check in\" and it only happened twice. I just don't understand how people can shun their own flesh and blood (an innocent baby nonetheless) and totally coddle someone who's messed up on drugs like that. Ironically, his mother was a single mother of four and was always complaining about deadbeats and how hard it was...yet basically gave her son a pat on the back to do the same. Guess apples don't fall far from their trees.",

When we first got married I thought it was going to be a struggle. We got into one fight and he ran back home and I told him if he ever did that again he could stay there. I was afraid he would choose her. He didn\u2019t. His mom tried to pull out some bible  verses about respecting your parents and he just sent her the one that basically says a man is supposed to leave his parents and cling to his wife (we are atheists and she knows that). He\u2019s in therapy now to unpack all that, but he\u2019s chosen me and she\u2019s spiraling and it\u2019s so fucking weird to be a part of. I have a lot of empathy for the men in this situation because they don\u2019t realize it\u2019s abuse and how they take that into relationships where either they want their wives to be another mom but one they can have sex with or how they\u2019ll allow their mom to trample all over the relationship. \n\nMy husband went off on his mom and said it was one of the most cathartic things he\u2019s experienced.",

When he got married, he sat my mom down and told her the rules before he even told me about the wedding date so that he could reassure me that he set boundaries before I even had to start thinking about it. \n\nOP's husband doesn't have a relationship with his siblings because of *his* behavior, not because of the mom's behavior. I don't see or speak to my mom but my brother does, and he's never judge, questioned, or pressured me like everyone else in my life has. I have no doubt that my brother is completely on my side.

Like regardless of your other dietary choices, kids need proper nutrition. Junk food is okay in moderation when it is part of a balanced diet of nutritious foods. If they were eating real meat burgers or impossible burgers, chicken nuggets or \u201cchicken\u201d nuggets, they still need other nutrients that they won\u2019t be getting from that. Fruits, vegetables, dairy products and substitutes, legumes nuts, etc. There\u2019s so much more that needs to be part of a healthy diet. You can easily raise your kids vegetarian and be healthy but you can\u2019t only rely on fake meat that\u2019s just not healthy. I hope those kids ended up being fed properly balanced meals. Throw some tomato and lettuce on top of that impossible patty, have a side salad with the nuggets, make a chickpea salad for protein and vegetables together, try some plant-based milk or tofu with calcium. Jeez that\u2019s scary that some people think a healthy vegetarian diet is just junk food\n\nEdit to add: vegetarian even means regular dairy is allowed. Milk, cheese, and yogurt can all be healthy in the right amounts. And eggs! You don\u2019t want your kids eating a beef patty but eggs are an excellent source of protein and other vitamins and minerals",

GMa was a narcissist and the baby of the family came late in life (he was just six years older than I am).  She enabled him to the point he never grew up.  He did marry a woman but mom didn't like her so they divorced after two kids.  The woman wanted him to act like a man and be a father and stuff.  That didn't fly with GMa.\n\nAnyway, GMa did die, fairly soon afterward, and Uncle marries an older woman with no kids so he can be properly mothered again.  Fate interferes and the older woman gets in a really bad car wreck, is permanently disabled, and now he has to take care of her AND get a job, a new experience as GMa had supported him before.\n\nHe tried suicide a few times but, eventually through some mental health interventions, managed to make it to 64 before dying of natural causes.",

It sounds to me that the one thing OP's soon-to-be-ex can't stand is for OP to be right on anything, to have an opinion or decision apart from his (which also happens to be his mother's opinion/decision too). OP seems to be owning her decision to walk out, she should continue to make it very clear to the ex that SHE made the decision to leave a marriage that included his mother as a full partner, that SHE decided that she deserved more and deserved a real husband, and he's just not it, he's not enough.  Probably won't penetrate his narcissistic, mommy's both shield, but OP should keep telling him in her actions and words that she herself is making decisions for what she wants and needs, that he's just not it.\n\nThat said, I'm sorry for OP that what she thought her marriage was going to be about turned out to be so wrong.  But hopefully lesson learned and she'll be more careful with the next man she chooses to devote time to.",

When his parents divorced when he was in early teens, she never dated or remarried so he became the man in her life/man of the house. Plus him being an only child only made it worse. Anyways, she would want to sit and watch movies on the couch with him while holding his hand, would guilt him if he didn\u2019t call every day \u201cI could be dead and you wouldn\u2019t know it!\u201d, and when we moved to another side of town (not deliberately) she guilted him again with the move on purpose to \u201cget as far away from her as possible\u201d. Everything had to be her way, my way of things was irrelevant and I was to conform/mold to her way, but she was still to always be priority over me being his wife. She even tried insinuating I had a \u201cmagic vagina\u201d or whatever because she couldn\u2019t really control him that much anymore. Whole thing was sick, gross, and he didn\u2019t really ever stand in my corner or be on our side. \n\nSo, anyways\u2026.good on you, keep moving forward and never look back, and please do look into some therapy just to process all of this because that whole mother/son dynamic is NOT NORMAL.",

As soon as it started getting serious and we spent a lot of time together, the mom would make similar types of sexual jokes about me as if that was the only reason we were dating. Her brother was also dubbed man of the house at an early age so he acted more like her father than her brother. I was constantly compared to him and getting his approval was dangled in front of me like a carrot. Of course she didn\u2019t think any of this was weird. It wasn\u2019t until I came across a thread in this sub where ppl were talking about emotional incest and it blew my mind. The description of it couldn\u2019t of been more applicable to this girl and her family. Sounds like what\u2019s happening here. \n\nOP\u2019s husband is a douche but ultimately his mother failed him as a parent. Your comment and this post make me think emotional incest is more common than people realize. It\u2019s a toxic form of parenting that needs to be talked about more because it ruins relationships in the kids adult lives.",

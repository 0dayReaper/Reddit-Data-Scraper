Your family should be more understanding of your partner's situation and both of you guys' feelings. And they need to understand that you and your partner don't like their behavior when drinking",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nIt is important to note that my family tend to excessively drink when invited to events or parties, and things often get a bit chaotic. \n\nI (24F) and my partner (26M) have been together for 6 years. Early on in the relationship, my partner disclosed that he was in recovery after struggling with alcoholism during his teens. It wasn\u2019t a big deal in our relationship as I don\u2019t really drink anyway and we don\u2019t keep any alcohol in the house. However, when we attended my cousin\u2019s wedding about 4 years ago, my family got extremely drunk and tried to pressure my partner into breaking his sobriety. It caused a small argument within the family as we left early and \u2018offended\u2019 my cousin and her husband. \n\n2 years ago I got a huge promotion and we wanted to celebrate. But, my husband felt uncomfortable with throwing a party due to the way my family behave under the influence. So, we decided to exclusively serve non-alcoholic drinks at the party. On the day of the party, we decided to pour the drink into large pitchers and label them to avoid people reading the labels and we took out the trash to get rid of the bottles. The party itself was quite tame. They drank their usual amount and kept making comments like \u201cwow, I don\u2019t even feel tipsy\u201d or \u201cI can barely feel anything\u201d. We tried to shrug it off as \u201coh maybe you built up your tolerance\u201d. After the party we decided to continue to serve non-alcoholic drinks at parties that we hosted. \n\nA weeks ago we were at a dinner hosted by my grandparents, where again, my family tried to force alcohol on my partner all evening. He finally snapped and revealed \u201cYour all so much nicer when your not drunk, why do you think we keep serving you non-alcoholic drinks when your at ours\u201d. The room fell silent for a few seconds, then all the questions started. We tried to explain our situation and why we don\u2019t serve alcohol, but my family were furious. We left shortly after but my phone has been blowing up ever since. My family has boycotted parties that we host and refuse to accept any form of apology. \n\nI\u2019ve told friends about the situation and the response has been very divided. Some are saying that it\u2019s not my place to force people to abstain for drinking alcohol. Other say that it was my party, therefore my rules. Am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

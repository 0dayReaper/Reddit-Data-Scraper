We are still in college and like going out with friends or just each other. This past weekend we decided to go out with our neighbor (we\u2019ll call him Nick) and his friend from home(we\u2019ll call him Jake). My roommate is friends with Nick much more than I am and they text frequently. Nick asked if we wanted to go out with them and we agreed. This was our first time meeting Jake but all seemed fine and he seemed nice. As the night goes on we are all having a good time and talking like normal. Jake begins to head towards the bar for another drink and asks if he can get me anything. I agree and thank him but he never asked my roommate if she wanted anything. I didn\u2019t think much of it as most times when we go out together it is men typically buying her drinks and flirting with her. My roommate is a very traditionally attractive girl and catches the attention of most men. It\u2019s normal for men to approach her and not really talk to me. As much as it can hurt my feelings I\u2019ve learned to not take it so personally and not let it ruin my night. Unfortunately Jake not asking her if she wanted a drink made her very upset and her mood did a 180. She walked up to him and asked if they had a problem. He responded with \u201cNo, I thought she was pretty and wanted to buy her a drink. No hard feelings though.\u201d My roommate then said she was no longer her in the mood and said she was going to leave. I asked her if she wanted another drink and that I would get it for her but she refused. I didn\u2019t want to leave because I was having a good time so suggested she get an Uber home (she takes Ubers alone frequently and has no issues doing so and the bar was one we were very familiar with and close to home) she asked me why I wasn\u2019t coming home with her now and I responded with \u201cI\u2019m having a good time and don\u2019t want to go yet, I can just make it back with them\u201d she booked her Uber and left without saying anything else. She has now not spoken to me after this incident and has actively avoided leaving her room when I am in the common areas of our apartment. I feel like I have done something wrong and don\u2019t know if I should apologize l. So AITA for not leaving with my roommate?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She could have just been nodding along to make you feel better. Also, if it hurt your feelings that much, why keep bringing her? I mean, that was a choice.\n\nAlso, you are now putting your husband square in the middle of this. It\u2019s not exactly generous to say that you won\u2019t \u201cforce\u201d him to stay away from his family, but that you won\u2019t try anymore and don\u2019t want to be around them? You are making him choose.\n\nEdited to acknowledge that I misunderstood who was being complained about - stand by the judgment, though - I think it\u2019s crazy to gripe about a stepkid to their family and expect no fallout, and also stand by not sharing information from SIL.",

If we took a family trip I always invited my MIL and she happily joined and I liked having her there. I also invited my adult step to join us on trips and whatnot to which she said yes, but then not respond again or say she had to work, but then I would see on social media that she was in fact doing something else entirely. When she would join us I never got a thank you or a shout out even though she would post selfies of the trip, just not of anyone but her. I cried to my SIL and she seemed understanding on why feelings were hurt. I understand it\u2019s not just me who is done that way, but I don\u2019t know how to address it other than telling my step it\u2019s ok to say no. At Christmas we spent time with my family and I lamented to my MIL of my hurt feelings, that I understand that I\u2019m not the only one treated that way per my SIL, and that I\u2019m tired of constant hurt feelings. We all parted ways and suddenly neither my SIL, my MIL, and my steps quit speaking to me.  Then I got this note from my SIL:\n\nFrom her:\n\nI have resisted to message you until I got my thoughts straight.  I have welcomed you into the family and considered you my friend for yrs. Things started not adding up. I talked to some people and found out you have been putting words in my mouth that were most definitely not said by me, to others, To get your way in situations.  Now i know you are head strong and push to get your agenda the way you want things to go always. Even pout and throw hissy fits if things don't go exactly as planned. I've taken up for over some of these instances. It went to far when you told lies to others about what i never said. I do not tolerate this at any level.  I will not cause any family drama at get togethers but I also can not have you in my life on the daily.\n\nI obviously said something, I have reached out to all parties, but no one is speaking to me. My husband wanted to \u201cfix\u201d it, but I told him opinions were formed and it wasn\u2019t worth getting in the middle. Now my MIL has tried to get him angry with me, and even though I have again reached out, no one will communicate with me. I deactivated my Facebook and personal IG over this which instigated the issue even further. I have obviously upset everyone but I honestly don\u2019t know what was said so I can make amends. I am obviously the asshole in their eyes and if they won\u2019t communicate after I\u2019ve tried, I don\u2019t want to try again. Does that make me the even bigger asshole? I won\u2019t force my husband to stay away from his family, I just don\u2019t want to be near them.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

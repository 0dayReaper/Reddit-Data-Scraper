    "postText": "So, Ever since I had my son months ago, my husband has started making indirect comments about my body. He never says any hurtful words but I find his \"observations\" as he calls it hurtful. For example, he'd see me wearing an old top and say \"oh that top used to look good on you but not anymore though...\" or when he looks at my waist and says \"Wow, didn't know your waist could get this wide!\". Basically passive stuff that I tried to ignore til it extended to friends and family. FYI this went on for months and months and months!!.\n\n\n\nWe went to christmas celebration at his family's home. My SIL complimented my floral maxi dress and my husband said \"I agree it looks nice on you...though I have to admit that your waist could get smaller than this!\". Awkward silence took over. I was absolutely fuming and this was my last straw. So I got up from my chair in the middle of dinner and shouted at the top of my lungs \"SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MY BODDDYYY!!!!\". He was absolutely speechless as his family stared while some others tried to get me to calm down but situation got more tense and dinner ended up being cut short and my husband storming off to his friend's place to spend the night upon leaving a very nasty text saying I embarrassed him and made a scene over an \"observation\" he made. He called me childish and told me to get therapy for my insecurities instead of verbally abusing him and scaring his family.\n\n\n\nNow I feel like an absolute idiot asshole and like I ruined christmas for him and everybody with my over sensitivity. AITA??",

No therapists encourage it, but those who use gaslighting use therapy to find easier ways to manipulate people. A therapist will only be able to use the information that's shared to them to form their opinions and give advice, so it's too easy to control the outcome. If you need an example, the Netflix show *You* has plenty within the first season, and I highly recommend the show too.",

He ran for it and she chased him out of the house and down the steps with the knife in hand. Once he was gone, she locked the doors behind him and enjoyed her perfect steak dinner in peace. When he came home the next day she only agreed to let him in if he stopped insulting her.\n\nAfter that, she never cooked for him again. They've been married 50 years and she had never cooked a meal for just him and very rarely cooked for our family when we were kids (we went out or he cooked).

Like look- having a kid is hard on dads too, they also experience hormone changes, grieving the loss of their old life, feeling like their wife/gf isn't \"theirs\" anymore etc, (and i say this as a woman) so if this was a case of one or two off handed \"oh shit I spoke my shitty intrusive thought aloud cuz I'm so exhausted\" comments about your body's changes I'd still say fuck him for that, definitely confront him and let him know how awful it makes you feel, but a new kid is hard on everyone and it's not something to end an otherwise fine relationship over.  \n\nBUT- you say he's been doing this consistently, over the course of MULTIPLE MONTHS, in front of OTHER FUCKIN PEOPLE?? Absolutely not. This def does fall under the realm of emotional abuse if you ask me. You're allowed to be a dick to your partner sometimes; we are all only human. But this is not that. This is a concerted effort to break down your self confidence, esteem, and eventually self worth.  \n\nNo decent man thinks insulting his wife/gf's body- which just created a new life, thank you very much- is an in any way okay or acceptable thing to do. This is not the kind of example of a loving relationship you want your kid to grow up around, OP. I know its very much not the easy choice but unless he's suffering from some really severe depression or something (and even then, I'm skeptical), leave him. NTA",

A man whose wife goes through the physical trauma of birth and its lasting impacts on her body and all he can see is she isn't a hot 20yo anymore is not going to appreciate her physical sacrifices. He's not going to see it as something she did for him, to give birth to their child. He sees it as he lost his sexy living fleshlight and his breathing blow up doll got stretched out. He will almost inevitably leave her for someone half his age and tell all his buddies his wife \"let herself go\" and he deserved better.\n\nThere's no marriage left to save once the guys mentality stoops this low.

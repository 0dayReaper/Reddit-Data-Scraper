    "postText": "First post so I hope I\u2019m doing this right.\n\nIn about a month I (18 F) will be going on a cruise with my parents and friend (19 F), I\u2019ll call my friend M. This trip is a family vacation but is also part of my graduation gift and I\u2019m very excited about it, but I know that M is going to ruin this trip for me. Every trip I\u2019ve gone on with her in the past has been ruined by her, mostly because she gets upset over small things, takes it out on us (her friends) and refuses help with offered. She\u2019s the type of person that doesn\u2019t care about things unless it affects her, and I\u2019m tired of having fun trips that are often once in a lifetime opportunities ruined because of her. The last trip I went on with her was once again ruined because of her and I considered asking my parents to take her off the cruise trip so I can have a good time on it and not have to deal with M\u2019s normal stuff, but I decided to give it time so I wouldn\u2019t make a harmful decision based on the temporary emotions I was feeling at the time. The breaking point was probably a week ago, when I overheard M tell her mom that she was planning to bring her nintendo switch on the trip with her. I invited her on this trip to hang out and have fun with her, but everytime she brings out her switch she completely ignores me and wants to do nothing but play on it, even when it\u2019s just us like when I have her over for a sleepover and I constantly try to do something with her to no avail. I know that M will do this on the trip, and I know that I can\u2019t handle her doing nothing but play on her switch, take her anger out on me, and be in a bad mood the whole time. My mental health has been effected by M in the past and I know that if she goes on this trip it probably will be affected again. I just started to see approvment from when my mental health got really bad because of her on last trip I went on with her. A few things, no I can\u2019t talk to her about this. I can\u2019t change her personality and for the small things talking won\u2019t do anything, I tried to talk to her about things in the past but nothing has changed even after she promised to do better. I know taking her off the trip is an AH move, but I\u2019m looking out for myself and I can\u2019t deal with her anymore. So, if I do this, WIBTA?\n\nEdit- Thanks to everyone who replied, it gave me a new perspective on the situation. I\u2019ll talk to my parents about how I feel but ask them to not take M off the trip.",

While I definitely understand not wanting to have to deal with someone like that, especially while on a boat of all places, and needing to look out for your mental health, it is definitely an AH move to uninvite someone after you've already invited them to something.\n\nThat's not to say you *shouldn't* uninvite her, sometimes we have to be \"assholes\" in order to protect ourselves. If I were in your position I would probably uninvite her and use my time on the cruise to have fun and seriously evaluate whether or not I want this person in my life anymore. Since you've just graduated you have an opportunity to let some of those high school friendships that don't really serve you go.\n\nYou will most likely upset this person if you uninvite her, especially from such a big trip, but it's ultimately up to you. Next time this sort of situation comes up I would encourage you  to trust your instincts about people because a lot of grief could have been spared if you'd just listened to yourself in the first place. It's a good lesson and I wish you luck.",

While I don\u2019t necessarily think you\u2019d be the AH if you rescinded the invite, know that doing so will almost certainly end the friendship, if you could even call it that.  If you\u2019re ok with that, then move forward with removing the negative Nellie from the trip.  It is, after all, partly a graduation gift. You deserve to enjoy it.  \n\nIf you decide to change nothing, accept she\u2019s gonna play on her Switch but you go ahead and do you on the cruise. You are not required to hang back and watch her waste this travel time on a video game. Take a book and sit by the pool, participate in some of the on board activities like trivia, go to the shows. \n\nAnd don\u2019t think of it as being stuck with your parents but as an opportunity to start having an adult relationship with them. My husband and I cruise with our adult kids frequently and we have a blast. Maybe have your mom do some of the activities with you - girl time kind of thing. \n\nNote:  this close to a cruise date means you\u2019re not likely to get anything refunded on fare. Depending on the cruise line, when booked and any discounts, there\u2019s not a whole lotta difference between paying for double occupancy or a single occupancy cabin. This I know our daughter is single and our son is married.  The most you might get back is their calculation of the cost of meals for one person.",

Wouldn't her bringing her switch be a good thing if all she does is play it? Cause she'll leave you alone and you can enjoy your trip without her? Sucks for her to focus on switch instead of the cruise, but wouldn't that be good for you?\n\nNonetheless, it's always good to help our friends go through struggles or give them good experiences too. But not if it is to the detriment of ourselves. You can only pour out whatever good you have in you. So take care of that good. And it's normal to cut people out of your life to do that.

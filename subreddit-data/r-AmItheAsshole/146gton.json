So for about 2 years now we\u2019ve been pretty civil and a year ago we became closer than we\u2019ve ever been. The issue with my aunt is she has no filter at all. She says exactly what she\u2019s thinking. \nThis has never been an issue until the other night we were all sitting around the table and she decided to bring up ny mother and the situation we got into the fight about in the first place, and she had been drinking so I knew it wasn\u2019t going anywhere so I asked her to just stop talking about it. This made her more mad, as she said I was just trying to say I was right again and don\u2019t want to hear anyone else\u2019s opinion. I tried to explain that because she had been drinking I didn\u2019t feel like it was the right time to have that conversation that\u2019s been an elephant in our room for almost 5 years. This is something we need to discuss in a serious and sober setting, but she refused to listen and now we\u2019re back to not talking again. I hate this because I don\u2019t have much family and I just recently got her back. I need everyone\u2019s advice on how I can fix this, or if I even should. I feel like an asshole for not just letting her vent and say what she needed to.",

If you want to be close to her again, I recommend reaching out to her but explaining your boundaries when it comes to topics you don\u2019t want to discuss with her / when it\u2019s the right time to talk about such topics. If she can\u2019t respect that, I don\u2019t think you should try rekindling the relationship.",

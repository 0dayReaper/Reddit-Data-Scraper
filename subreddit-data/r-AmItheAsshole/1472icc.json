    "postText": "for context, i (16m) have had a complicated relationship with food since i was young. its very easy for me to be turned off of something i was going to eat because someone took part of it, or i learned something about how it was made, or theres an ingredient i dont like thats in it, etc. my family is aware that i dont eat much, but i think only my brother and sister know that its because i have a slight ED.\n\nso today, i wanted something to do with my hands and i wanted a coffee cake muffin. i made the muffins, let them cool, and plated them. my family has five people in it, so i made 10 in case anyone wanted any. my dad (52m) comes in and sees me grab a muffin for myself, and he grabs a knife and cuts off a piece of it for himself. \n\ni know that im irrational for doing this, but i just lost my appetite and walked away. my brother called my dad a prick, and then my dad got mad and left for a drive. after he came back he told me that i needed to apologize to him for walking off \u201cin a huff\u201d, and tells me im too sensitive and that he\u2019ll just stop joking around with me.\n\nso, aita?",

Based on his comment that \"he'll stop joking around with [you]\" it sounds like he was very aware that talking your food would be triggering for you and did it to get a reaction. Total AH move. And then he got called a prick and drove off (total overreaction), upset because he got called out. Then he demands an apology for your reaction and says you're too sensitive. How blind can he be to his own behavior?",

I\u2019d say maybe say that you\u2019re sorry for how things occurred, but don\u2019t necessarily apologize for doing it if you would stand by it again. Instead of I\u2019m sorry about how I reacted yesterday, maybe say I\u2019m sorry that things didn\u2019t go well yesterday between us.

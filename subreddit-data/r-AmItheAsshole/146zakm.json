    "postText": "I, 16M have wanted to change my middle name ever since I was little and I\u2019ve always hated it. I\u2019m named after my grandfather but the name makes me uncomfortable and it makes me feel really dysphoric for some reason. I brought it up to my parents that I wanted to change my name and I need both of their approval legally for it to be changed. My dad has no issues with it but my mum got all defensive when I asked her and said that it was disrespectful to my grandfather if I changed it, and that he would be upset with me if I did so. I cant get it changed without her permission but I desperately want my name changed. AITA and am I disrespectful to my grandfather for wanting my name changed or should I just try and keep my middle name even though I don\u2019t like it.",

It is very personal and plenty of people change their names for many reasons. It might help them to think of the name you want to forgo, as an ugly sweater , gifted to you with love but not quite your style. You can graciously accept a gift and later do away with jt. They named you thoughtfully and in memory of your grandfather, which is sweet in theory. But that sweater is feeling pretty itchy, tight and sweaty at the moment. To take it off and donate it, or shove it in the back of the closet is for your comfort. It does not mean that you are ungrateful or insensitive, just that wearing that sweater any longer will drive you crazy. It might help to share how you are feeling with your mother and reassure her that you understand how she feels about your grandfather. It might even be worth brainstorming some other names from the family tree. I hope things get easier. If all else fails you can change it when you are an adult, and nobody has to know.",

Which sounds a lot at 16 but you'll have your entire adult life with the name you want.",

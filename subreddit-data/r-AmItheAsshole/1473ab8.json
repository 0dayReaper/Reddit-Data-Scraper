(Such as losing a child, family member dying from a random shooting, etc) Bob has really had a rough life, so I feel for him, but we've also discussed what is and is not acceptable before. I normally give a reminder if things get too out of hand with oversharing, (looks like he'll cry or make someone else cry from story sharing.) (Which over the years I only had a problem in the beginning after losing his SO.) Besides verbal reminders and no one else ever complaining about him, (clients or workers) Ive never felt the need to police it more. If someone asks him to stop or that they don't wish to talk about something, he'll normally apologize and go quietly back to work. \n\nI'd probably have to read more into our company policies, but I don't think off the top of my head we have a very good policy on preventing bullying in the workplace, sadly.",

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo to give background I work with about 40/60 others in a management roll and share responsibilities with probably 4/5 others. \n\nNow I've worked at this company for a few years now and have a worker we'll call Bob. Bob can be slightly annoying, (doesn't always listen to direction we'll, randomly trauma dumps on coworkers/management without prompt and sometimes runs around after clients and trauma dumps/distracts them.) \n\n\nHe's friendly and never crossed any boundary lines of being inappropriate towards our workers, or clients. (Unless we include random trauma dumps, such as grandmother getting shot, family drama, pet getting taken away, passing of SO, being cheated on, etc.) Bob just really likes oversharing and also doesn't know how to keep secrets well, (if you tell him not to tell anyone something you might as well have put a billboard out.) \n\nI regularly try to think of \"fun things\" for our workers/us to do, such as BBQ's, after work drinks, etc. I'll try to plan something maybe once a month/once every other month, it's never mandatory, but they do know BBQ's and such I pay for out of pocket and bar visits I'll normally provide a round and some fries or something to that extent. \n\nBob has worked for the company longer than myself and was so ecstatic when we started doing these things since he loves the chance to see everyone and socialize. Quiet a few of our other quieter team members also enjoyed the chance to \"make friends\" and socialize outside of work so all and all I feel it's a really good thing. I'll normally leave an open invite as well for past workers if they wish to swing by and keep in touch with any of our current workers.\n\n\n\nAnyways onto the actual problem. \n\n\nOur newest person to join our management team, (well name her Sky) has said to me repeatedly she doesn't like Bob. I've asked if there was anything he's done wrong, and she's said, along the lines of annoying/doesn't listen well/etc. She's told me repeatedly she'd love to come to our get together but doesn't feel it's fair I keep inviting Bob since she doesn't want to be around him. I've tried pushing to make sure nothing abnormal happened, but she's firm on the fact she just doesn't like him because of his weird behavior and his inability to stop oversharing. \n\n\n\n\nI'm don't feel its fair to exclude Bob from these events just to make her feel comfortable to come. I could understand if she felt unsafe or something, but just not liking him doesn't feel like a valid reason. Our other coworker whose worked their for a while as well says I should just exclude Bob once or twice for Sky's sake to help her feel more comfortable with the rest of our group and that Bob won't care. \n\n\n\nSo Reddit, instead of listening to my coworkers would I be the asshole for not inviting Sky going forward since she demands Bob's exclusion?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

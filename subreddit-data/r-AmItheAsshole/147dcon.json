It has been 6 months since I moved and ever since I have been feeling like my friends don't want me around, let me explain. Every time I text our gc or private messages I'm left on opened but when anyone else texts there is immediately a whole conversation. I texted my bsf about how I am feeling and she got mad and said that they do care and she just doesn't like that apparently every time I text it's about a boy (which it's not it's mostly about my plans to visit). So I blew up on all of them I said if they didn't want me around just say it and I was immediately bombarded with messages saying I'm an asshole for saying that to them and being mad that they don't reach out and expect me to put in all the work to keep the friendships alive. So am I the asshole for getting mad at them?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

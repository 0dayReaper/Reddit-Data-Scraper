I mean that\u2019s fine if he also just really liked you after the first date, but then why would he try to insist that you come to him even after you gave valid reasons for not wanting to? He seems like the type to push boundaries until it\u2019s clear he can\u2019t anymore. And the way he gave in after seems like he wants the chance to get to woo you more so you\u2019ll be less resistant to what he wants. Obviously this is all assumptions, but I\u2019m just telling you how I would feel personally if this situation happened to me. I would probably continue seeing him but be more alert to red flags\n\nETA: I didn\u2019t even notice the age difference at first. It\u2019s not inherently awful but based on the events that transpired, I\u2019d be even more weary considering that",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nAbout 1.5 weeks ago I met a guy on OkCupid who lives near the Canadian border. I live in a major city in Canada. He drove up to my city (3.5 hours) for our first date and I had a lovely time. I really like him so far. I definitely want to come visit his city as well and alternate, but I\u2019m still not comfortable coming to his city yet as he has a huge physical advantage over me. He could easily overpower me, and you don\u2019t know someone after one date. He knows his city inside and out, plus I don\u2019t drive. It\u2019s not safe.\n\nHe tried to say that the risk he took coming to see me was the same, but imo it\u2019s not. I\u2019m a petite female who can easily be snatched up. I spoke to my father, mother, and grandmother and all of them said not to travel to him on the second date. \n\nI told him I would like for our second date to be in my city once more, and he respectfully pushed back. I told him he can always just date a girl from his city, then he back-peddled and told me of course he\u2019ll still come to me, but that he hopes I change my mind.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "postText": "So my boyfriend (21m) and I (19f) recently had our roommate move out. We decided that since she had left the room and the bathroom pretty messy, we would spend a day cleaning the apartment and making it look nice. \n\nWe both work 32 hours a week at the same place so neither one of us is the designated chore person. I took on the 2nd bathroom (the one our roommate used) and dishes while he vacuumed and did the laundry. \n\nAs he was vacuuming, he kept asking me to come out and make sure he did it right, or help him move things around so he could get somewhere. I told him that I needed to do the bathroom and unless he was willing to help me do my set of chores, I didn't think it was fair that I keep helping him with his. \n\nHe asked me what I needed help with, so I asked if he could just do the sink of our own bathroom, which wasn't all that dirty, it would just save me a minute or two of cleaning. This led to a fight where he said it wasn't fair since I'm doing the other bathroom anyway and that since he didnt care that our bathroom was messy, he shouldn't have to clean anything. \n\nI got upset and said that he could apply that to anything to get out of doing them, like \"I don't care if my clothes are clean so if you're the one who wants them washed, do them.\" I just wanted a little bit of help since I was also cooking the first non frozen thing we would be making in the apartment and it was going to take me about 2 hours on top of everything else. \n\nHe told me he'd just take over the dishes, but when we got home from the store, he finished vacuuming and threw the laundry in and just hopped onto his game (on my pc). So I asked if he was going to do dishes, to which he said no because it was my chore and wouldn't be fair. I replied \"Can you just unload the dishwasher then, so it'll be easier for me to do dishes after I finish cooking?\" \n\nAgain, no, because it wouldn't be fair and I was being \"A huge Asshole\" to ask him to do more than me.\n\nI just don't think that vacuuming and throwing in a load of laundry is equal to scrubbing the bathroom, cooking, and unloading then loading the dishwasher, but I may be wrong.

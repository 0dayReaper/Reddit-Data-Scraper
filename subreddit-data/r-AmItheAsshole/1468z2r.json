    "postText": "\\[This is a throwaway account since I am very active on my main account &amp; I do not want my families business put on blast\\]\n\nMy (25 F) brother, \"Jack\" (32 M), is currently staying with my husband and me. Jack has been living with my husband &amp; me for a little over a week due to ongoing disagreements/verbal arguments with his girlfriend, \"Jill\" (30 F).\n\nYesterday, Jill came over to the apartment to talk with Jack &amp; give him time to see their son. While she was over, she went to get a soda from the fridge in our garage. Our apartment is 2 floors with the first floor being a garage/laundry room &amp; the second floor is the living areas. When Jill came back upstairs she was yelling \"You think I don't know what's going on here but I'm not f\\*\\*\\*ing stupid.\" &amp; she threw a small trashcan from the garage across the room (she did not throw it at anyone, just into the room we were sitting in). She then took her son &amp; stormed out of the apartment, screaming the entire time. \n\nJack followed her outside but I stayed upstairs to clean up the mess from the trashcan.When Jack returned after a few minutes, he informed me that Jill was upset because she could see that I had thrown away an empty package from new underwear into the trashcan in the garage. According to Jack, Jill took this as evidence that I was trying to seduce my brother by enticing him with new underwear. Jack said that he doesn't blame me for Jill's reaction; however, Jill &amp; 2 of her sisters have been blowing up my phone accusing me of intentionally planting the empty package in order to trigger her &amp; cause problems. They are calling me insensitive for \"not thinking about how seeing that would make Jill feel.\"\n\n*Additional Context (Feel Free to Skip): (1) This was not a package of \"sexy lingerie;\" I am 8 months pregnant &amp; I bought a pack of XL grannie panties since none of my other underwear fits right now. (2) This is not the first time Jack has come to stay with us due to these issues with Jill; however, this is the longest time he has stayed with us continuously (usually he will only stay for a night or two to give Jill space after an argument). Their arguments usually stem from Jill accusing Jack of looking at other girls. She also routinely accuses him of cheating with various coworkers, friends, &amp; even random people they pass on the street. (3) This is not the first time that Jill has accused Jack of being interested in me or other family members. (4) These types of arguments have been happening since the beginning of their relationship. (5) 2 years ago, Jack &amp; Jill conceived a child within a few weeks of casual dating &amp; decided to move in together so that their child can grow up in a family environment.*\n\nSo, Am I the Asshole?\n\nTLDR: Brother's girlfriend saw that I threw out an empty package of underwear &amp; accused me of planting it to try to seduce my brother.",

I believe she may be experiencing postpartum depression and I try to accommodate her as much as possible (i.e. making sure I am dressed modestly when I see her, I do not hug or sit by my brother as this upsets her, etc.) but I genuinely did not think she would go through my trash to find this package.

She accused both of you of incest and threw an item of furniture whilst being verbally abusive. You are 8 months pregnant! Being hit by even something small can cause serious complications, and the stress from being shouted at and accused of something so heinous could also cause complications. She put yours and your unborn child's health at serious risk.\n\nLet alone the way other people could behave if she repeats those accusations. Some people always go with the mentality 'there's no smoke without fire', and you could be ostracised, your career could be damaged, or even have the police contacted to investigate potential incest, which is a pretty serious crime. Are those the extremes of what could happen? Yeah, but you never know how things can spiral. Why would you take the risk?\n\nIf Jack complains, he can leave. And frankly, he shouldn't be involved with a woman this volatile. I would even argue that she is unstable enough to not be safe parental figure. He needs to break up with her and pursue a custody agreement that will keep his child safe. Either way, tell him that she never comes near you, your family or your home again, or you will call the police.",

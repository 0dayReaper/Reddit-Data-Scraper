    "postText": "I am a high schooler with a weekend job at a coffee shop. My coworkers who work weekends are: \n\nJames - the owners son, he goes to my school. He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy.\n\nDanielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too.\n\nSo sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.\n\nSo James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.\n\nSo one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.\n\nSo James came in and was like \"sir is there a problem here\" and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like \"OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired.\" \n\nI started acting real sad, like \"no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee\" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.\n\nThe angry guy started to backtrack, like \"It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it\" and James was like \"No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service\"\n\nOf course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and \"fire\" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences. \n\nAnyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.\n\nAITA for this joke?",

I've stepped in and told off teenagers for trashing the coffee station at our local convenience store- I've told off shitty parents for letting thier kids trash the toy or clothing sections of a store- more than once I've had customers try raging at the Manager to get ME fired from these places (which is always hilarious).\n\nI love when I get to say \"Sorry, asshole - I don't work here. I just choose to stand up for innocent young employees who are just doing thier job and are being abused by some grown ass moron who didn't get hugged enough as a kid \" \n\nPeople can be REALLY shitty to retail employees- I had to step in when a parent once began screaming at Lego store employees for LETTING THIER 4 YEAR OLD WANDER OFF after they dumped thier kid in the store like it's a free babysitting service so they could go eat dinner in peace accross the mall. That one was particularly fun because I made it VERY clear that I was sticking around long enough to talk to both the Cops and CPS who got involved. Turned out- it was the THIRD TIME that week they'd done this- leaving for over an hour each time... and the 2nd time the kid was crying that he needed to go to the bathroom. \n\nWtf do these assholes think store employees are supposed to do- leave to walk a little kid they don't know halfway across the mall so the kid doesn't shit in thier store?! Thank GOD A nice off-duty cop had been there to help that time- but the parents snagged the kid and took off before they could get caught.\n\nNot the 3rd time though- and I stuck around and told CPS the entire story- including that these shining examples of parenthood had been out in thier car smoking a blunt when I parked- while thier kid was inside the Lego store alone. CPS left with the child and the cops left with the parents in handcuffs. That was a good night... Though I did feel bad for the kid, it was probably for the best.",

I've met too many people who behave like Basil Fawlty trying to fire Polly when they don't get their way.\n\nOP and the leading hand picked the right customer this time, but yeh.\nYou're right, and if they keep doing it they'll probably find out that it's not an actual, viable plan for dealing with horrible customers.\n\nI've dealt with a customer who wanted me fired because she spotted a tactical Police group was meeting with Paramedics and Firies on public property adjacent to the shops i was \"guarding\", and i refused to go evict them (the government emergency services) from public property (the armour and guns scared the children, she said. The cops weren't fully armed and armoured yet, and the kids seemed rather pleased and excited about it all. I couldn't tell them \"ehh i think they're getting ready to raid a local meth lab\" when they asked, even though they actually were).  Then this woman carted her kids off to the coppers and ambos and firies *and told them to leave*. I saw a cop give the salute (straight arm, open hand, universal sign language for \"Fuck. Right. Off.\") and back she came.\n\nA few weeks later i was a supermarket customer when i saw that woman again lol this time she was trying to upset the checkout operator, and escalated it into a formal complaint to management. I hung back cos i saw and heard everything, told manager what customer had said, and i asked that the operator be given a pat on the back for the way they handled it.\n\nThis woman wasn't a Karen. She was Proto Karen/Chris/Guy In A Gibson Shirt. An extreme example, but she was used to being rewarded - getting things a bit cheaper, getting staff in the shit, getting freebies. Her habit of complaining isn't unusual, just the level she took it to.",

When they got to order, they were already annoyed that it was busy. So they order these two large specialty lattes (like $6 a piece). After they're rung up, we put the ticket on the machine so we can get to the orders in order. A few minutes later, before we've started making it, one of them comes up and asks for hers to be made extra hot. \n\nSo worth noting: the coffee shop I worked at did things different than other chains because it was a small, local, mom &amp; pop shop. We steamed our milk for lattes to about 135-150F instead of 160F+ like other chains because milk burns at those temps and we didn't like to serve burned milk. When customers requested 'extra hot' we would steam to about 160F.\n\nSo I'm making this lady's drink and I steam her milk to 160F. Finish the drink and call it out and move on. She picks it up and goes back to her seat but comes back a minute later practically screaming about how I gave her a cold drink and how it's not hot enough. I ask her if she'd like me to microwave it to heat it up and she's yelling about how she paid and arm and a leg for this so she wants it made fresh and made hotter. So my manager who had been lingering steps in and explains our process of why we don't typically make the drinks hotter than that. The woman will not let my manager get a few words in and keeps yelling about how shitty this place is for charging so much for cold drinks (again, not actually cold at all, just not molten or boiling). So she demands the drink be completely remade and made hotter. \n\nI look at my manager for what to do and she just shrugs and says, \"I guess make it again. And make it super hot.\"\n\nQueue me pulling four more shots and prepping the cup of ingredients and getting the milk ready to steam. I put the milk thermometer in and start stretching and steaming. It passed 130. It passed 140. It kept rising; 160, 170, 180, until finally the milk is bubbling and splattering at about 190. I am barely able to pour this abomination of steamed milk because it's gotten so thick. I call her name again and give her a smile so sweet it could give you cavities, \"Extra hot, as requested.\"\n\nShe took a sip and I saw her physically recoil but she just thanked me and walked away. \n\nMy manger was laughing her ass off in the kitchen afterwards. Glad I didn't get in trouble for totally ruining the customer's drink even though it was legit what she requested.",

Basically no taste difference by diluting a large drink with 100ml of extra water. What difference in taste there is is significantly less gross than burnt milk, and makes the whole cup 15-20 degrees hotter which is usually enough.\nAlso, pre-hearing the cup works too. Just fill it with boiling water and let it sit 30 seconds while you get the milk ready. Works for takeaway cups too.",

If a customer is upset in the store, the manager will call back the \u201coffender\u201d and fire them in front of the customer to satiate them. Then, the guy who\u2019s job it is to be fired just goes back to the back room and waits for another customer to get angry so he can be fired again. I think it\u2019s even better that you\u2019re using it to make people think twice about being a-holes in the store\n\nEDIT: So I\u2019ve just looked over all the responses and a lot of people are telling me it\u2019s not true. Honestly, the first place I saw this fact was elsewhere on Reddit being talked about completely seriously and none of the replies claimed it to be false or untrue. I know it\u2019s not a reliable info source but I kinda just saw this post remembered what I had read and thought it may be a good addition to the thread.\n\nHowever, seeing as it\u2019s false, I don\u2019t really see the harm in not removing it cuz it\u2019s still a humorous concept to think about, but after seeing the comments and researching for myself it\u2019s clear my fun fact should not really be labeled as such.",

This is, to a much lesser extent, the exact thing that the customers are doing by being irritable and rude to the customer service reps who absolutely do not deserve it.  Just because they don't deserve it though, doesn't mean they are not the assholes in giving the same treatment back.  Since in this case I think it is at least somewhat justified though, this is definitely a very minor reason for them being the assholes.\n\nThe main reason they are the assholes is for causing a scene at work that could directly impact the business.  What happens if another reasonable customer sees this and thinks that she was \"fired\" for unjust reasons and posts a rant about it on Yelp or something that would then negatively impact customer growth and sales?  To them, it is just a couple friends playing a prank on a rude customer.  To the business it could cost revenue and growth.",

For a teenager the line between a legitimate customer complaint and \"making a big deal out of nothing\" might not be very clear. I can assure you that the last teenager who served me in a retail setting saw there being no issue whatsoever with the fact that there was a piece of broken plastic in my daughter's food. After all, he said, they made her a new burger.\n\nI wasn't yelling. I wasn't rude. But I was insistent that I wanted to speak to someone to register my complaint with the issue. I'm sure he took that as \"making a big deal out of nothing.\"\n\nBeyond that, while a business is under no obligation to change on a dime when a customer complains, it probably should not send the message that, so disinterested in my feedback are they that rather than listening they will make a game out of it with me being an unwilling participant.\n\nI deal with teenagers every day. I'm a teacher. And sometimes when one is being a rude little shit of course you have a little fantasy about doing something like this to teach them a lesson. Ultimately, though, part of the job is not taking crap personally. Teenagers aren't rude because they are bad people. They're rude because they're teenagers and life hasn't beaten them into a less shitty state yet. It's coming. If you can't help but fuck with them then this isn't the job for you. We have to, above all, maintain professionalism. While this may have been funny it was not at all professional and if you're working for someone and representing their company, the least you can do is put forth a modicum of professionalism.\n\nSo I'll go with YTA.",

I\u2019m assuming that the hot coffee freak out is a fair example of the behavior that triggers this type of response from OP and her coworker. But I worked in customer service for quite a few years as a teenager and in my 20s and OP\u2019s description of a customer reacting to insufficiently warmed coffee doesn\u2019t shock me in the slightest. Adult customers (who I\u2019d argue should get slightly different treatment than teenage students, though I truly can\u2019t begin to imagine the behavior you must have to deal with) can be real jerks to the people they see standing behind the counter.\n\nEither way, I\u2019m not sure how much we\u2019re disagreeing on principle. Seems more like we\u2019re coming to different conclusion regarding the accuracy of OP\u2019s synopsis. I say that not to challenge your position, just to note that I think we\u2019re probably at an impasse on this one\n\nETA: you aren\u2019t the same person I was initially responding to! My mistake. The above still stands, as a general matter, but feel free to disregard any of my response that clearly suggests you and I had been going back and forth for a bit lol",

We are not here to just accept whatever they say. That's really the opposite of our purpose here. \n\nWas the customer unreasonable? Maybe. Or maybe the coffee was, in fact, under temp. If I order a hot cup of coffee and get a tepid one am I not allowed to bring this to the attention of my barista? \n\nAnd what if I do and my barista responds, rather unhelpfully, with \"Hey man, nothing I can do. That's how it came out of the machine.\"\n\nThere are ways that a coffee temp complaint could be a very legitimate complaint. \n\nAsk yourself, at the end of the day, if you have a complaint about a product you've just paid for would you rather get an honest and thoughtful answer from your barista or their manager? Or would you rather they just assume it's bullshit and begin theatrics to fuck with you?\n\nBecause that's what happened here. That's all I'm saying.\n\nI suppose, along the lines of what you're saying about not sure how much we are actually disagreeing, I can simply see the likelihood that two teenage employees were fucking around at work. Maybe even that the fuckery led to cold coffee which sparked the complaint in the first place. \n\nGiven that OP's and OP's manager decided to default to fucking with the customer right away, it tells me that the customer may not have been upset with the coffee temp as much as the response to what could have been a legitimate  complaint.",

No one would learn anything and the issue could happen again. Instead I took the time to investigate. I went to check my batch and turns out my thermal shuttle is broken and losing heat. Then I checked the timer. The coffee was past its 1 hour shelf life. The broken shuttle coupled with the barista on register not switching out fresh batches every hour caused this woman to get a tepid coffee. \n\nBy looking at the situation before reacting I was able to offer the woman a beverage up to our quality standards and salvage the relationship to bring her back, order new equipment, and remind my employee why our shelf life standards are in place. In that situation, everybody won (well... except my maintenance budget. A $300 charge on the first day of the month is never a good omen)",

Doing something like what you and your coworker did is definitely an asshole move in this situation, and I'm willing to bet if the owner was there, the two of you would have been reprimanded. The customer was simply stating the coffee at your establishment isn't being made hot enough to his standards. The better course of action would have been to apologize and explain it is made at the temps supported by your equipment, and if they need it hotter they may need to look for a new coffee shop that brews at higher temps. Customer service is a difficult job, and many people aren't cut out for it. There is almost always a better answer then being an asshole back to them.

Whether they act like an asshole or not, they usually have some sort of legitimate complaint. You can't just ignore it.  Take this example about the coffee being cold.  The OP says there's nothing they could do.  If that's honestly the case then this is a terrible coffee shop. Is there no solution to cold coffee at your coffee shop?\n\nMost of my most loyal customers (and sometimes they've become friends of mine) had some wrong that I righted and blew them away with customer service.  \n\nYou don't know what's going on in their lives that made them angry.  Do you want to be someone who brings some kindness to their life or someone who made them feel bad for getting some poor kid fired?",

Sure it's funny to tell your friends, but you are creating a work environment that doesn't take customer concerns seriously. I'd be more impressed if you were able to placate both employee and customer.",

I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot...  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf it happens a lot, is it possible you guys don't treat customers with respect?",

    "postText": "I know you can't call dibs on a country but my question is more about the social aspect of it. So here goes:\n\nI love to travel. I know other people take a lot of time to save for and plan their pretty luxury vacations and that's fine but not my style at all. I just book the cheapest flights, book accomodation for the first night, throw stuff in my backpack and see what happens. Usually I travel around the country I visit with public transport and don't do a lot of touristy or luxury things. Therefore I a) don't spend that much money on vacations and b) don't need time to plan ahead.\n\nWhile I have a bucket list I also love to just randomly decide and see places I don't know anything about.\n\nIt happened a few times (3 times if I remember correctly) now that friends told me about a destination and I thought \"wow, sounds good\" and went myself. Apparently this is trashy behaviour as I was told after the last incident: a friend told me about their next big vacation plans. Lets say they plan to go to indonesia (changed real destination in case she reads here) in 2025. They plan to stay in resorts and have a private driver or sth. so it will cost them a fortune and thus they save for another 2 years. she told me a lot about the country and why she wants to go there and it sounded pretty nice. So I decided to go there this fall and booked flights.\n\nI can't really hide this fact anyway so I told her soon after. She and 2 other friends I \"stole\" destinations from (Greece, Japan) in the past then told me off. \nThey said it is hurtful, dampens their own joy and is sort of arrogant to just spontaneously visit those places I am \"indifferent\" about when they are very passionate about them, dream of and work for it for years. And that I should at least wait until after they travelled there. I sort of see where they are coming from but when I hear about an interesting place I also don't want to wait 2 years until they finally did their trip.\n\nSo AITA?",

They're hardly off the beaten path, and I would imagine places that are on many people's bucket list.  Greece was the first place I went overseas once I had a job, because I really wanted to see the Acropolis in Athens and temple at Delphi badly.  The Parthenon is one of the world's most iconic buildings - as in top 10 buildings you should try to see before you die iconic.  I would imagine that if Westerners go to Asia only one time in their lives, it's likely to be to Japan to do the Tokyo-Mt. Fuji-Kyoto route.\n\nShould OP have waited until after the friends went first, since they had already mentioned it?  That gets a little hazy when talking about common bucket list destinations that alot of people want to get to as opposed to hidden gems.",

Maybe they feel like you're rubbing it in their faces. Maybe they feel like your option to travel on the cheap is an indictment of their desire to experience something more \"touristy\" or \"luxurious.\" I don't think you're an ah but I do think that if you want to keep folks from feeling like you're one upping them that you should be a bit more conscientious of planning trips and communicating your experiences in the places they dream of going. If you keep doing this folks won't want to share vacation plans or trip experiences with you. You can't call dibs on a country of course.

They would do research about resorts, beaches, sightseeing destinations, cocktail bars, famous restaurants and art galleries. I'm interested in hiking areas, nature scenery, local lowkey food, historical monuments and museums. So we don't really overlap in interests so even if they did tell me about their research it wouldn't really help. \n\nWhat they mostly tell me (which then sometimes sparks my interest) is about weather, climate, landscape, animals or cultural aspects. But from there on I do my own research.\n\nE.g. when I \"stole\" the idea to visit Greece I already knew I wanted to travel in October (really shitty weather in my country) to somewhere warm but not too hot where I could hike, preferable some mountains and the sea nearby and I kinda felt like visiting a smaller island because I only had one week. Then a friend told me about Corfu and her plans to go there next April and what she said about it just seemed to check all my boxes, too so I went in October. Don't know if this already counts as using them as \"free travel agents\".",

But you're not actually taking their researched travel plans or even seeing the same things so they don't have a right to claim you're taking away from their own future plans.\n\nThat said it shouldn't be too hard to make a list of places you want to travel to and the months you think would be best to go to them and just pick one at random. You can still take note of what your friends say about different places but you can also not make them feel like your jacking their destinations right after they share it with you.",

I love *travelling itself* but I don't have any dream destinations or anything. I am interested in all the different places more or less the same. I usually only have criteria for my next vacation like the ones I mentioned above for the Corfu example and then I have to research for places that match. \n\nI know for most people it's the other way around: They want to go somewhere specific and then they research when and how to do it. For me it's more like I know I want to travel and I have some points on how the vacation should be and then I have to find destinations. \n\nProbably the fact that I'm so \"neutral\" about destinations is also why I struggle to understand why people have hurt feelings over sth. like this. \n\nIn the future I will just refrain from getting my inspiration from my friends plans to keep the peace.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI know you can't call dibs on a country but my question is more about the social aspect of it. So here goes:\n\nI love to travel. I know other people take a lot of time to save for and plan their pretty luxury vacations and that's fine but not my style at all. I just book the cheapest flights, book accomodation for the first night, throw stuff in my backpack and see what happens. Usually I travel around the country I visit with public transport and don't do a lot of touristy or luxury things. Therefore I a) don't spend that much money on vacations and b) don't need time to plan ahead.\n\nWhile I have a bucket list I also love to just randomly decide and see places I don't know anything about.\n\nIt happened a few times (3 times if I remember correctly) now that friends told me about a destination and I thought \"wow, sounds good\" and went myself. Apparently this is trashy behaviour as I was told after the last incident: a friend told me about their next big vacation plans. Lets say they plan to go to indonesia (changed real destination in case she reads here) in 2025. They plan to stay in resorts and have a private driver or sth. so it will cost them a fortune and thus they save for another 2 years. she told me a lot about the country and why she wants to go there and it sounded pretty nice. So I decided to go there this fall and booked flights.\n\nI can't really hide this fact anyway so I told her soon after. She and 2 other friends I \"stole\" destinations from (Greece, Japan) in the past then told me off. \nThey said it is hurtful, dampens their own joy and is sort of arrogant to just spontaneously visit those places I am \"indifferent\" about when they are very passionate about them, dream of and work for it for years. And that I should at least wait until after they travelled there. I sort of see where they are coming from but when I hear about an interesting place I also don't want to wait 2 years until they finally did their trip.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

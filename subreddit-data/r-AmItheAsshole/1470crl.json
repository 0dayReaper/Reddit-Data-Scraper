    "postText": "I'm a (18f) big sister to two little sisters. Both have gotten their periods, but we're only going to talk about one sister today, the youngest, who is 12. \n\nShe has had her period for 3 years now and I noticed that she is extremely unhygienic. She would leave her used pads on top of the bathroom sink and leave blood all over the toilet. We used to live inside a two bathroom house and she would use my mom's bathroom while I used the household bathroom, so it didn't really bother me much because I was not affected by it since we used different bathrooms anyways. \n\nI did talk to both her and our mom about it but she still didn't change over the years, mom usually was the one to clean up after her but never forced her to clean up after herself. \n\nFast-forward to present times and we moved houses. We only have one bathroom now and her hygienic practices while on her period has made me reach a breaking point. \n\nShe still continues to leave her pads on the bathroom sink, she leaves blood on the toilet seat and the floor, I noticed that she would leave bloody underwear on the floor right next to the toilet, and she would sometimes even get blood on the light switch which makes me think that she doesn't wash her hands after using the bathroom. It's disgusting. And to make it worse, instead of actually owning up to her mistakes when I tell her to clean up, she gets mad, starts huffing, puffing and stomping like I annoyed her and no matter how many times I tell her to clean up after herself, she'll still do it again the next time she uses the bathroom. \n\nI've honestly had enough and I'm thinking about forcing her to use the bathroom in the old outhouse in our backyard if she continues these practices on her next cycle, but I'm conflicted on if it would be too harsh and uncalled for. So, WIBTA if I went along with this plan? \n\nTLDR; Would I be the asshole for forcing my sister to use the bathroom in an outhouse because of her poor hygiene? \n\n(sorry for any spelling errors, on mobile)",

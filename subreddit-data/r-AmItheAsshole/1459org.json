    "postText": "Was on my way to a concert last night, travelling by train, and the seat I had booked happened to be next to a Muslim man. Sat down and cracked open a tinny without thinking about it. A few sips in, he taps me and politely asks me if it\u2019d be okay if I didn\u2019t drink. I ask why (note that where I am, drinking on public transport is perfectly legal \u2013 unsure if this is the case everywhere) and he says that he can\u2019t be in the presence of anyone drinking alcohol. \n\nI have a think, and a quick look around to see if there are any free seats, but alas there are none. I apologise and say that I won\u2019t be on the train for too many stops but I\u2019d like to have my drink. He begrudgingly accepts, turns his back to me, and I have my two small cans before getting off. \n\nSo what do you think? And problems with what I did? Or perhaps it would have been better if I only had the initial drink I\u2019d already opened and nothing else?\n\nEDIT: Some FAQs \u2013 while he didn\u2019t explicitly tell me he was Muslim he was dressed in the full gear of an imam so I can pretty safely assume he was. He was also white. It is possible there are other reasons he couldn\u2019t be around alcohol (potentially a former alcoholic) but this didn\u2019t cross my mind at the time, nor did it before I read some of your comments. Mind you, his tone and a subtle gesture to demonstrate his outfit indicated to me it was about religion, but I could well have misread this.\n\nIncident happened entirely in England, although the train had originally come from Scotland (may be unimportant \u2013 but I\u2019m Scottish and the man in question was English). Perhaps more important \u2013 drinking on the train is illegal in Scotland, but not in England.\n\nEDIT (2): One of the best points I\u2019ve heard from a friend was that the guy was white and English, meaning that he was quite possibly not raised a Muslim and may not be as intimately familiar with Islamic law around alcohol, and/or he may have turned to Islam recently after struggling with something such as alcoholism. While this is wild speculation, I feel like this would explain the scenario very well. Any new commenters, what do you think?",

I understand its legal for OP but just because it's legal you probably dont always expect to be sitting nect to someone drinking.

When using public transport one has the reasonable expectation to be able to complete their journey with as little discomfort as possible, and causing as little discomfort as possible to fellow passengers. And just because you can/are allowed to do something does not necessarily mean you should be doing it with no regard for others (for example, it's permitted/not illegal on public transport to clip your nails, however I'd be very grossed out and uncomfortable if someone started doing it next to me on the train, and I'd consider that very rude).",

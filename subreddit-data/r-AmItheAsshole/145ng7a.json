    "postText": "Tl;dr: my BIL stole dozens of video games from my collection so he could buy his own. When I found out he had stolen once, we kicked him out of the house &amp; had an intervention where we told him he needs therapy. I filed a police report in order to try to get my pawned things back but didn't press charges. The next day I found out he has been stealing for weeks so I pressed charges. The family is divided &amp; anger is directed at me. \n\nMy brother-in-law (18) moved in with me &amp; my wife 2 months ago because he had trouble at home that resulted in him being homeless. We put together a room for him in our house. I have a large collection of games. Some are sentimental. \n\nHe is a legal adult with a job, but he's still in high school (now summer school). Our agreement was he didn't need to pay rent until after graduation. All utilities &amp; groceries were covered by me. \n\nEarly on he had issues. Traffic violations that I paid for. My wife added him to a credit card to help him build credit &amp; he abused that and couldn't pay so we cancelled it. \n\nWhile we were out of town on a family vacation we left BIL home &amp; asked him to watch our pets. While we were gone he skipped school every day, failed to graduate, neglected our pets, &amp; made a mess. He didn't pay his bills, lost his car insurance, &amp; phone.\n\nWe confronted him about his behavior and I felt it went through to him. But my wife discovered a receipt from a pawn shop that had 30 of my games on it. I checked &amp; they were all missing. I called the shop &amp; they required I make a police report in order to get back what they had. I spoke with my wife &amp; in-laws about what we should do about BIL. During this, his father said \"I think jail would teach him a lesson\". We confronted BIL &amp; he confessed to stealing the games so he could buy his own. He agreed to move out (back in with his parents who had kicked him out before) &amp; to therapy. I made a police report &amp; I said I would not press charges.\n\nThe following day I discovered 20 more missing games &amp; I called the shop to see if he had pawned them. They confirmed that he had on at least two other occasions. These items would need to added to the police report. I called his mom and told her that he had been stealing for weeks. She said  _maybe he should be charged then_. \n\nI called the pawn shop back for a full list of what he traded &amp; he mentioned several records that my wife owns &amp; I lost it. I called the police &amp; pressed charges. I stopped short of declaring that he had stolen over $1K worth of stuff - a felony. Instead he's facing a misdemeanor. \n\nMy in-laws blame me for ruining BIL's life, that I am unfair to him since they think he is mentally ill, that he won't be able to stick to therapy because of it. I feel I have been made a victim twice &amp; I still am finding things missing. AITA?",

Since the property belongs to the original owner, they lose the money they forked for it.)  They're following proper steps.\n\nA good note here is that it is important that the shop immediately take these goods off of display if there is a report of something they have being stolen even before a police report is in hand.\n\nThere is a proper process to retrieve stolen goods, but continuing to deal in stolen goods when you're aware they might be won't get you much sympathy and some attention from police when the report does show up.",

Bonus points if they're experienced in his  condition(s), whatever they are. \n\n\n2. An evaluation by both a neurologist and a psychiatrist. Try looking for someone who likes to work with their colleagues. They refuse to sometimes, imo. \n\n\n3.  Convince him to take whatever meds the colleagues prescribe. If he refuses, ask the therapist to teach him coping strategies. \n\n\n4. Family therapy might work to get new and healthier interactions among you all. \n\n\n5. Don't coddle him up. Yes, he has a lot of issues. Yes, he failed to grow up. But he still needs to learn how society works. The sooner the better. \n\n\n6. Respect and love him, but don't enable him. \n\n\nReporting him was a good choice imo. It's kind of letting him know that his actions have consequences. I suggest bringing this up in therapy so he can learn how to properly function in society and how to better cope. Honestly, something that blocks my patients' progress sometimes is precisely the fact that there are no consequences for whatever they do. Thus, there's no reason for them to change.",

If not, my understanding is court appointed attorneys can be very good. If this case moves forward, the attorney should work to see if the new psych evals, etc, will sway the prosecutors or the judge, hopefully the case won\u2019t get to a courtroom for judgement. \n\nDM if you want me to do some googling.

He's calculated enough to pick out the legacy games and things of value to pawn. He's taking full advantage of you, your wife and his parents. \n\nGoing out of your way to help him hasn't done anything other than allow him to screw you over. As a former SEN teacher, most if not all of the kids I taught are capable of knowing right from wrong and not taking a dump on the people who help them. Those who don't, definitely do not have the life skills to fence stolen goods, cherry picking the best ones and hiding it. \n\nHe knew exactly what he was doing. No one is doing him any favours by pretending he doesn't and absolving him of all consequences. His behaviour is egregious, as you put it, and pretending he shouldn't be responsible for it is just going to cause bigger problems down the line because he won't have those skills.\n\nIf you keep on with pressing charges (which I think you're not at all wrong for), your in laws can get him a good lawyer that argues for him getting in-patient (preferably) treatment, or they actually pay for inpatient treatment. Since none of you think he will stick to outpatient treatment. If he needs help, get him proper professional help...you've done everything you can.",

Check your local laws, can you get some type of restraining order or no trespass order against him. Obviously change the locks, consider one of the new ones with a keypad, then you just change the code. If you had a hidden key outside change the location or just don't have one. \n\nIs BIL vindictive? Consider that he may tell a low life friend what you have and where it I'd so someone else can break in. Change wifi password as well. Can you get security cameras and a doorbell camera? \n\nI'm sorry you're going thru this. I am a touch paranoid so I think about what could BIL do if he gets mad at you and wants revenge? How can you protect yourself from those possibilities? If he doesn't then your general safety is just better, but if he does try something you've taken measures to protect you, your wife and your property.",

Hard drive capacities have gone up a lot, I suggest doing what you can to save every bit of the info for the next couple of months. The BIL may try to get someone else to steal from you when he is obviously somewhere else. The paranoid in me suggests what ever security info BIL knew about be changed or altered or improved. \n\nAnd make sure you change your wifi password.

And the fact that they let him pawn more even after the first report shows that they will be of no help to you.\n\nHis kleptomania could be the result of some mental issue. It's odd he would pawn 30 old games to get a couple new games...when I'm sure if he asked you you would help him get new games. As a gamer/collector myself, if a family member needed help with anything gaming related, I would gladly help. I assume you are the same way. You were in the right to press charges. You gave him ample time to stop. If he cannot stop then he needs mental help for sure. Good luck to you and your collection.",

                    "comment": "The pawn shop hasn't been as helpful as I would like, but the first evidence of theft I uncovered was actually the _most recent time_ he stole from me. The other, past events the manager at the pawn shop uncovered were actually about a month ago and BIL didn't fess up to stealing multiple times when we confronted him. \n\nThanks for understanding. I felt goofy reading the list of games over the phone with the police (\"Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, Pok\u00e9mon Silver\" etc.). Something that has been really troubling to me is that nearly every game he pawned he got maybe a fourth of the selling value out of and they are all valuable games on the second-hand market. Which tells me he took the time to figure out what was valuable rather than just boxing up as much as possible. I understand this is how pawn shops operate, but he sold Super Smash Bros. Melee for $15. I can never recover it for that amount. But that's the amount listed on the police report because that's the value traded. It would likely cost me thousands to replace what was lost because I can't just go to Walmart and get another copy of any of these games. They're all legacy console games.",

That's awful. And it's crazy that if you even got money back for it they would only be for those pawned amounts. I'd never let this family member in my house ever again. It's crazy because his behaviors almost seem like drug addict behaviors, although I assume an addict would've just grabbed any games they saw. \n\nAs someone who also has a lot of rare titles that I either paid retail or far less for, I feel your pain. I don't buy high priced scalped items and I never will. So I just accept the fact that I won't own stuff like Panzer Dragoon Saga or Shining Force CD. But I'd be gutted if someone stole my Complete copy of Kuon for the PS2 that I paid $14.99 before my 20% employee discount when I worked in gaming retail 15 years ago.",

When I found out he had stolen once, we kicked him out of the house &amp; had an intervention where we told him he needs therapy. I filed a police report in order to try to get my pawned things back but didn't press charges. The next day I found out he has been stealing for weeks so I pressed charges. The family is divided &amp; anger is directed at me. \n\nMy brother-in-law (18) moved in with me &amp; my wife 2 months ago because he had trouble at home that resulted in him being homeless. We put together a room for him in our house. I have a large collection of games. Some are sentimental. \n\nHe is a legal adult with a job, but he's still in high school (now summer school). Our agreement was he didn't need to pay rent until after graduation. All utilities &amp; groceries were covered by me. \n\nEarly on he had issues. Traffic violations that I paid for. My wife added him to a credit card to help him build credit &amp; he abused that and couldn't pay so we cancelled it. \n\nWhile we were out of town on a family vacation we left BIL home &amp; asked him to watch our pets. While we were gone he skipped school every day, failed to graduate, neglected our pets, &amp; made a mess. He didn't pay his bills, lost his car insurance, &amp; phone.\n\nWe confronted him about his behavior and I felt it went through to him. But my wife discovered a receipt from a pawn shop that had 30 of my games on it. I checked &amp; they were all missing. I called the shop &amp; they required I make a police report in order to get back what they had. I spoke with my wife &amp; in-laws about what we should do about BIL. During this, his father said \"I think jail would teach him a lesson\". We confronted BIL &amp; he confessed to stealing the games so he could buy his own. He agreed to move out (back in with his parents who had kicked him out before) &amp; to therapy. I made a police report &amp; I said I would not press charges.\n\nThe following day I discovered 20 more missing games &amp; I called the shop to see if he had pawned them. They confirmed that he had on at least two other occasions. These items would need to added to the police report. I called his mom and told her that he had been stealing for weeks. She said  _maybe he should be charged then_. \n\nI called the pawn shop back for a full list of what he traded &amp; he mentioned several records that my wife owns &amp; I lost it. I called the police &amp; pressed charges. I stopped short of declaring that he had stolen over $1K worth of stuff - a felony. Instead he's facing a misdemeanor. \n\nMy in-laws blame me for ruining BIL's life, that I am unfair to him since they think he is mentally ill, that he won't be able to stick to therapy because of it. I feel I have been made a victim twice &amp; I still am finding things missing. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You don't help people live their lives as close to normality as they can by giving them special dispensation to do whatever they want.

They've effectively foisted his issues off on to you and your wife this way, and they have the gall to have a go at you for it? \n\nYou have given this man chance after chance, many of them at your own risk in order for you to help him out, and every single time he's not just let you down but cost you. And now he's stolen from you. Enough is enough. \n\nIt's time to remind the in-laws that the only thing standing between their son and his misdemeanor being upgraded to a felony is what you've held back from the police. Something you held back to be kind to him even though you're the victim here, so that the lesson he learns is a less permanent one than what he'd earned with his own actions. Remind them that every time they start blaming you for this as if you were anything but the victim, your need to be kind to the man who repeatedly stole from you slips that little bit more.\n\nAnd even then, with fair warning given and actually going ahead and telling the police everything that happened, you're NTA.",

I marked it in my calendar and reminded my husband a few days ago, at which time he confirmed that he had RSVP'd \"yes\" for us and texted me a photo of the invitation which stated that the party time was from 11am to 3pm. Last night before bed we again confirmed with each other that we were planning to attend.\n\nThis morning, around 9:30am, my husband let me know he was leaving to play tennis with a friend. The tennis courts are about 5 minutes away from us, so I assumed he would be able to play a quick game and make it back in time to shower before the party. He left, and I went ahead and got ready for the party. 11am came around and no sign of him. By 11:40, I texted him and asked when he was heading back. He didn't respond until 12:40, at which time he was walking back into the house. When I (admittedly frustratedly) asked what was going on, he told me his plan had always been for us to leave for the party at 1 or 1:30pm, and said that I should have confirmed what time I wanted to leave. I told him that this is a more formal party (meaning invitations were sent, clear start and end times noted, a meal served, no indication that this was a casual come whenever you want kind of situation) and that I expected that he would plan for us to leave in enough time to be reasonably on time. I told him at this point I would rather not go than arrive hours late, but he was welcome to go if he wanted. He decided not to because he said he didn't want to go without me. Some time has passed and I feel very embarrassed to have not shown up for the party, but also can't help but feel frustrated by my husband's attitude toward the whole thing. AITA?",

Although he probably would not appreciate a gift like \u201cMiss Manners Guide to Etiquette\u201d, he really could use a few lessons.\n\nYour husband should be the one to call and apologize for not attending.  I doubt he\u2019s man enough to tell his friend that his plan was to show up at 1 pm for an 11\nAM start.  But if he did, I\u2019m sure his friend might explain to him why it was starting at the time it was.",

For some reason, he stayed longer than he should have and he knows it. Personally, I would have gone to the tennis courts since they are close by around 11 am and said what the hell, AH?  We committed to attending your friend's party and are supposed to be there now. What are you doing? Clearly, a noon luncheon was planned. \n\nYou could have gone to the tennis courts at 11:40 am instead of texting and told him you were going to the friend's party then and he should go home now to get ready and follow.  You are two separate people, after all, each responsible for your own manners.  His lateness would reflect poorly on him, not you.  Now you both look like AHs for not attending at all or even explaining yourselves.",

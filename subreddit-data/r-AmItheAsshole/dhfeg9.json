I had a few phone calls with the mystery man 17 years later and then he dropped off the face of the earth (again). About 10 years later I get the call that he died. \n\nA few days after while I'm taking care of all the paperwork because I'm next of kin, I go out to dinner with my boyfriend and a friend, and we're talking about it. The server expresses her condolences and later, before she brings the check, she asks if there's anything else she can get us.\n\nMy boyfriend said \"yeah, a father figure.\"\n\nI called him an asshole not for the joke, but because he made that poor server so fucking uncomfortable lol. He's pretty good at making light of terrible situations when he knows he's in the company of people who actually feel better hearing those jokes.\n\nThe server got a really good tip lol.",

(This is when people still tried to make it a scandal.) We continued to live with my folks and my 2 younger sibs, who were in high school.\n\nOne thing we loved to do was sing. Anytime, anywhere, anything, it didn't matter. Bruce Springsteen's Born In The USA had come out about this time. So, here we are, singing I'm on Fire,\"my daughter in her little bouncy seat, happy as a clam.  We had just sung the first line, \"Hey little girl, is your daddy home?  Did he go and leave you all alone\" and my Mom hears it. \"Don't you DARE sing that song! She doesn't need to know she doesn't have a father! \" Hold for one beat......and we started howling! Mom is sweet and that's just a Mom kind of thing that she did, and to this day, she hates that song.\n\nIf nothing else, that girl loves her some Springsteen.",

One of them said that it is important to not overreact with anger or saddest. That just confirms their worst fear. That you believe what they said. He said to instead either say something like, \"But you're still my real son/daughter so unfortunately you still have to listen to me\" or make a joke. With one of his kids he said, \"So am I imaginary? Quick. Click your heels together 3 times and if I disappear then you are right. If not, then I'm real.\" \n\nI don't think you are the asshole and neither of my teens have used this phrase, but I would try to make sure she knows you don't actually believe that you aren't her real dad. I think the dad joke would have been okay if you didn't use the \"I'm your legal guardian\" line earlier. You are her dad. Let her know that you know that and nothing she can say will change that.",

It takes a big person to be a real parent, especially through these stages, whether it's through being a biological parent,  adoptive, foster, legal guardian,  etc.  We all have our breaking points into being a sarcastic asshole.

I totally agree with the poster that suggested you sit her down and tell her how much you consider her your daughter and love her as one, even if she doesn\u2019t feel the same.  Reassure her you will always be there for her if she needs you but you won\u2019t push her if she needs space.  \n\nShe probably occasionally feels like an outlier, as you have a \u201creal\u201d son with her mom, because teenage girls are hormonal and this is the age when they naturally gravitate toward their dads and sort of get at odds with their moms a bit.  Maybe it\u2019s a struggle with her emotions.  Snapping and lashing out like she did usually comes from a place of fear and insecurity.\n\nEven if she doesn\u2019t respond with anything but silence when you have the talk, trust me that it WILL mean something to her.  I was a moody teenage girl not too many years ago myself.",

Doing \"I'm not your dad\" seems a bit harsh to me, even though I know it was in response to her shitty teenage attitude, and she could have found it extremely painful to hear that from him. Then again, she might have not cared, it just depends on the teenager.",

You could have used this argument as a teaching moment not to go nuclear in a fight if you value a relationship. Instead you reinforced the behaviour by doing it yourself for a cheap point. Not cool.

            "comment": "As an adoptive child, even something like that framed as a' \"joke\" would have hurt if my parents said that to me. There is not a moment in my entire life where if my parents said \"haha, you're not my real daughter\" that that would not have hurt, joke or not.\n\nGranted, I didn't throw around \"you're not my mom/dad\" at my parents when we were upset at one another, so she threw the first punch. But, you said that she is your step-daughter and then you went on to legally adopt her.\n\nOne stigma that adoptive kids have to live with their entire lives is the notion that they aren't a \"real family\" and that their adoptive parents will never love them as much as if they were a biological child. Even as a little kid I had people, including adults try to tell me that my adoptive parents will never love me as much as if they I had been born to them as a biological child, and I had to develop a thick skin to those types of comments and trust in my adoptive parents and their ability to love me. Your daughter has to trust that with you too, and you just gave her a reason to doubt it.\n\nI'd also add that sometimes someone may hurl an accusation like that out of a genuine fear or insecurity. When you were upset with her, she may have had a genuine fear that you don't consider her to be your 'real' daughter, or that since you were disappointed in her at that moment, that means you will prefer your biological son more. By throwing out the accusation \"you're not my real dad\" it may have been a kind of round-about way to seek reassurance that this isn't how you feel, that just because you're upset with her doesn't mean you love her any less. Foster kids do that kind of stuff a lot to adoptive parents who show them love or warmth, because they are afraid to trust in it. It's fairly common for foster kids to say something like \"well just take me back to the case worker then!\" when they get in trouble with their family, because they have often experienced that exact thing before and it's a major fear that they have. I know your daughter isn't a foster child and didn't experience those things, but it's still not an uncommon sentiment for adopted kids to make and its root is oftentimes, fear.\n\nIt's a poor, shitty and hurtful form of communication but sometimes insecure teens will speak their insecurities exactly in that fashion. They accuse you of the thing they are afraid of, because they hope that your reaction to that accusation will provide them the reassurance that they need that it is not true.\n\nA lot of people find the joke 'hilarious\". I imagine a lot of it may be because they aren't adopted children. I think that joke hits at the root of fear for a lot of adopted children, and I think you just othered your daughter for being your adoptive child rather than your biological one. You could not have made that joke if she was your bio daughter, that's why you are singling her out. Don't treat your adoptive children like they are your adoptive children. Treat them like your child. That's it. Anything, including a joke, that points out that they are different for their adoption is going to be taken badly.\n\nIn addition, you refer to her here as your \"step-daughter\" and claim in the comments that you did this to \"simplify\" things. What, pray tell, is so complicated about saying \"my adoptive daughter\" or \"I married her mother and legally adopted her\". There's nothing \"complicated\" about it. You came on the internet and referred to your adopted daughter as your \"step-daughter\" the entire time, when they are two completely separate things. That is an asshole move and that makes me question you and your feelings for her a whole lot more than your joke.\n\nAs an adoptive parent you need to understand the very complicated dynamics that can exist for adopted children and you also should be intelligent enough to pick up on the fact that she could very easily have been speaking from genuine fear.\n\n&gt;My daughter was just quiet with embarrassment.\n\nI highly doubt it was embarrassment that made her fall quiet. In addition, even when a \"joke\" hurts someone, the correct thing to do is to apologize.\n\nYTA big time. I hope you apologize to your \"step-daughter\" soon.",

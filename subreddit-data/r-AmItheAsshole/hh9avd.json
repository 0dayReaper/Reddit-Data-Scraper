    "postText": "First of I'd like to say thanks to everyone who gave their suggestions and well wishes, unfortunately I didn't get to read everybody's comments as there are too many but thanks to everyone anyway.\n\nNow onto the update. I gave my mother a few days to calm herself down before speaking to her again, she eventually came around. She recognises that it's not optimal for my son to stay with her and that he would be better with my aunt. She knows that my brother is a slob and is giving him a good kick up the arse to get his life together and shit. I have spoken with a lawyer who has helped me with a lot of things including getting my son legally adopted by my aunt and her husband. He will still be staying with me until i... pass\nAs a lot of you suggested I made recordings and videos of myself giving him advice for his milestones. For example: when he looses his first tooth, turning the ages 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, his first girlfriend(or boyfriend if he likes, I've made a video in case he is in any way lgbt+) leaving secondary school, going uni, getting married or if he has any kids. There are also things I've put into writing, like how his mother died and that he was supposed to grow up with a twin brother that also sadly passed. I've also had my lawyer help me set up a little trust to will him \u00a340,000(from my girlfriends father when he died, she put the money in a joint bank account that I got when she passed) in case he needs help with university or decides to go travelling. All I have to do now is to enjoy the time I have left with him, I've moved my younger brother into my flat so that there will be someone to find me everyday for when I go.\n\nWhen I'm gone I can at least be comforted by the fact that the son I love so much is being taken care of and that I will see the girl I love again and our other angel I never got to meet.\n\nThank you all again\n\nEdit: this is op's brother writing this edit, he has since died",

My son is 10 now (2 when she passed) and I\u2019ve been doing this since day one anyway but at least he will have a few to look at if I do end up leaving him a bit too soon, or a few as he moves through the motions. Probably the best move I\u2019ve made a mum, mine passed when I was just 18 and I can\u2019t imagine leaving him at 20 without any little things to hear, read and look through for the years that I\u2019m not there for. Crying for you OP and loving you and your son so much, well done and Kia Kaha xx\n\nETA - I just love you so much and your boy too, I can\u2019t imagine being your age (am 26 now) and having to deal with my own mortality and also leaving my precious boy who is just my entire life in a nutshell without me there. My heart just cries for you both but you are just an amazing father and I\u2019m sure the choice you\u2019ve made will be the best for the rest of his future life. I\u2019m just so proud of you I can\u2019t imagine making that kind of a decision at your age. You\u2019re just so fab. Thank you for being you. Thank you xxx",

I would have loved to know how he felt about me becoming a mom or getting married. It kills me that I have to walk down the aisle alone. I also can\u2019t remember his voice which hurts so much and I would love to have had videos of him not just pictures. The two videos I had were lost when I got mugged and my phone was taken and laptop broken. So I really hope OP backs up anything he\u2019s saving. Having copies of the videos and letters could be really good in case something happens to the originals.",

As he's too young to remember you I think it would be nice to create artificial memories for him about what you were like, how you used to play together etc. Perhaps video yourself telling your son stories about his mum and your special memories of her/what advice she might give. Along with the videos you've already made with messages for milestone moments I think these will be incredibly comforting for him. Please make sure to back up those videos in multiple places/formats if you haven't already. You've done an amazing job preparing for his wellbeing after you're gone. \u2764",

What a wonderful and loving gift. \n\nEdit to add: Your son should watch the video even if he is not LGBTQ+, come to think of it.

Chances are he will have bouts where he blames himself or feels guilty that he got to live. Have something that reminds him that it wasn't his fault.\n\nIf you have videos of his mum, particularly while she was pregnant and talking to or about her bump, try to make sure he can access those.\n\nI agree with what someone below said. Have videos for the bad moments too with words of wisdom. \n\nIf you can, maybe write a card (could even be homemade) for each of his birthdays until 18 at the earliest. Maybe with a little gift for Christmas and his birthday, if you can afford it. Or ask someone you trust to do it for you. Take pictures of the cards and back them up incase of damage. \n\nMaybe encourage him to write back when he can. If you are buried/cremated but ashes not scattered, he could come read it to you. If you are cremated and your ashes are scattered, he could go to the spot where they were (if not too far from him).\n\nAnd have a few videos just because. Ones that just say that you love him and that you're proud of him. Ones that just says good morning, have a good day at school or good night, sweet dreams. \n\nI wish your son all the happiness in the world.

Apart from the obvious things, one thing I cherished when I got older was the long account of the whole process that my dad wrote down, detailing what happened when, how everyone felt, who their friends were that helped out, the names of the doctors, even what we'd talk about when we visited the hospital. Years later, people will always have wonderful memories to share about her, but few are able to actually talk about what happened and what it felt like after all this time. People want to hide any and all bad bits, only focusing on the good, and it left me with a hollow feeling. I don't remember much about the whole process, like I imagine your son won't. The letter made it feel finally real, and human, and finally something I could process and not be protected from. I felt much closer to both my parents and what they went through. It can't have been easy to write, but if I had to save one thing from the box of stuff I had, I'd chose that over any of her possessions. I'm forever grateful of my dad for being brave enough to write it. Also, I still grew up happy and loved, as will your son. Much love to you all.",

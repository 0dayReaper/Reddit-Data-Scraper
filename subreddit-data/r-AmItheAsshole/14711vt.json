Your feelings are completely valid, but Emily doesn't seem to care how things are for you and how she makes you feel. She seems like an attention seeker and therefore she would need someone who can give her a lot of attention and time. Therefore, recommending her to see a psychologist isn't a bad idea, as it is literally their job to give attention and time to their patients (and they can most likely offer her better help as well). You did nothing wrong.",

We became friends and all that stuff, and she started venting. At first it wasnt so bad, i appreciated that i could help her go thought her problems and to talk about it. We spend hours together, me trying to understand what was going on and her talking and letting go all her problems. But it started getting more frequent, to the point that i couldnt talk to her at all unless it was to vent. I kept going tho, for hours, even til 2am usually. But, it started getting wayy too much for me to handle, so i asked her if she could contact a psychologist, and that they would help wayy better than i could. She then started to ignore me, and now is trying to cut contacts with me. Idk what to do, i really enjoy her company but i cant keep going like that, its just too much for me to handle. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There are a myriad of issues surrounding leaving a long term relationship with children.\n\nYou're right, no one should put up with this behaviour from their partner but drafting the situation as \"Why doesn't she just leave?\" is just as much of a set back and just another way to chip away at women.",

                                    "comment": "You are right. My husband is what used to be called a \"psychopath\", nowadays it's called \"anti social personality disorder\" (translated word for word, don't know if that's correct in English) \n\n\nI have talked about it a LOT with him, to try to understand what goes on in their heads. It's really interesting. He only feels the primary emotions, like he can be sad, happy, angry, etc. But he doesn't feel any secondary emotions. Like when you see someone walking on the street naked and you feel kind of ashamed in their place, those emotions just aren't there. And the same goes for any kind of emotion you feel \"in someone else's place\".\n\n\nHe could easily do what the husband in the post did, because he will feel like he deserves a day off (true) but doesn't feel that other people need that too, there's no shame, there's no realization that he hurts others by his actions. Because he doesn't get hurt by others either. If he was in the OP's situation, he would not feel like he got \"wronged\" because the husband has a day off, that doesn't concern him. He can't feel \"unfair\". He also isn't able to understand what others feel, he is unable to put himself in another person's mind. And if he tries, he gets some really weird ideas, that are often completely unrelated or opposite to what the other person is actually feeling.\n\n\nHe constantly has to think about everything he does, and I actually mean every little facet of life. He has learned trough the years what \"acceptable behavior\" is, so he functions almost like a \"normal person\" now, but nothing comes naturally. So if even the smallest circumstance changes, he will not react appropriately, I actually have to explain it to him. In the above situation, if he wants to have a day off, that's planned at the start of the week, we talk about our planning, we arrange a schedule, like he takes the kids on Monday-Friday in the evening, so I get time off, then I take the kids Saturday and Sunday and he gets his time off. If then something happens that makes me unable to take the kids on Saturday, he will not automatically respond by saying \"ok, change of plans, I take the kids\" but he will be angry because his plans get cancelled and I don't keep my end of the \"deal\". We are now at a point where he kinda learned to deal with things like this, but it is still really hard for him.\n\n\nIt goes both ways, because he'll get really upset if I had planned something and it doesn't happen, and instead I decide to get some work around the house done. He'll tell me that I had planned to relax and I shouldn't be working, as he has to do everything today. The fact that I don't care, and am happy something extra gets done that wasn't \"due\" yet, is irrelevant to him. He can't feel those emotions, so he can't understand why I am not upset. \n\n\nBy the way, he does love me and the kids. But that's really special to him, because he doesn't even love his own mother. He has never felt love before we had kids, not even friends or something like that. He has been very confused for a long time about those weird feelings. For him, there's not much difference between a table and a human being. It's sad when it breaks, but you can always get a new one. It's really confusing to him that he has different feelings about me and the kids, like he's scared to loose us, can't imagine to replace us, stuff like that. When his dad died of cancer he was like \"meh, that's unfortunate, he was a great father.\" And he just moved along. Exactly like I would react when my favorite chair breaks. And the same reaction happened when his grandmother died. At the funeral: \"Such a shame, she was really nice to me my whole life. So what are the plans for this afternoon when we're done here?\" Not a single tear, nothing. I cried more than he did.\n\n\nSo yeah, really long story, the mind of a \"psychopath\" is really really really interesting, but never try to relate to them, that just doesn't work. And don't expect them to feel stuff like others do, they just don't, and asking them to is like asking a man without legs to walk. It's not going to happen, and you will only get really badly hurt in the process.",

I can\u2019t really look after little kids alone due to my disability but some friends used to live round the corner and when he was at home studying for med school and when they were packing up to move back to the US and various other scenarios, I loved coming over to baby sit.\n\nI would entertain the kids so the parents could power through but the rule was come get us as parents in any scenario you feel requires it. They\u2019d both schedule breaks to come out and check how we were all doing and as three adults we took turns to make lunches, grab snacks and cook dinner. But they always parented, always respected my no and always fed me or compensated me in some way and treated me as valuable.\n\nAnd I miss them terribly as neighbours and I miss seeing the girls grow up because it was a great arrangement. But the dad was \u2018I do not babysit MY kids. I parent them. And I respect anyone who gives up time to babysit MY kids.\u2019\n\nThey explained to the girls who were like 5 and 3 back then that sometimes I couldn\u2019t come babysit because I was sick and explained that sometimes being sick takes a while to resolve. So the girls used to get SO excited that I picked to see them on my well days and they often asked mom and dad if they could drop off a drawing if I was sick and not around for a while. Mom and dad also used to bundle them up for a walk on cranky days with \u2018we are taking Gerbil some milk and bread\u2019 and we\u2019d wave through the door or have a super quick hug.\n\nWe all got so much out of the babysitter plus parents dynamic but if this shit got pulled I\u2019d have been busy. Forever.\n\nI think it\u2019s actually really great to encourage parents to say when they could do with a bit of help like your big business meeting or have a day sitter so you can spend couple time doing nice stuff or even house admin but damn, don\u2019t treat the village like they are villagers and you are Lord of the Manor.",

Seriously, demanding your 17-year-old sister take time away from school/work to take care or your children, so your spouse can play video games?  She's clearly in a bad place, without the support of her co-parent.  \n\nIt also sounds like she's attempting to convert OP into a part-time co-parent, since spouse doesn't appear to be performing in this area.  It's disingenuous for her to say \"no one else can\" take care of the kids, when husband is right there.  If something's going on, she can say that: \"He's going through a rough patch, so I'm trying to cut him some slack.  Would you mind taking care of the kids even though he's home, so I can go to work?  We'll make it up to you.\"\n\nDad is right (this is *totally* funny), while the rest of OP's family is taking advantage of her for free babysitting.  This isn't unusual -- lots of families still undervalue women's time and work versus men's, *including many women themselves*.  OP could ask herself if sister and BIL would treat her the same way if she were a young man -- my money's on \"of course not!\"  Calling someone useless isn't great, but disrespecting a person's time and labor when they're struggling to do your job and you refuse help is *so much worse*.   Also, OP's 17 and sister (and maybe BIL) are in their 30s, so what reasonable person would possibly say she's the one in the wrong?\n\nGood luck, OP!  Go with your father on this one -- not only in terms of sticking up for yourself, but in treating your family's ridiculous behavior as a joke.",

I mean- the husband can\u2019t even claim that it\u2019s the woman\u2019s responsibility to raise the kids, as she works full time &amp; he works part time from home. It isn\u2019t old fashioned gendered nonsense, he\u2019s just a misogynist &amp; a poor excuse for a dad. He expects his wife to work &amp; take all the responsibility for kids. I\u2019m betting she\u2019s in charge of the chores &amp; cooking too. His day off &amp; his time is more important than his wife\u2019s &amp; he is completely comfortable with OP taking over if the wife has to go to work. He even demands OP respects him in relation to his having time to himself &amp; his lax attitude. \n\n&amp; those poor kids. Imagining a small child being hungry &amp; asking their dad for a snack &amp; being sent away because he is playing a game- what horrible rejection that is. Those kids will grow up learning to tip toe around their father, never bothering him with anything &amp; believing his needs are the priority at home above themselves &amp; their mum. If he treats them as tho he feels like a baby sitter, sends them away when they are hungry, doesn\u2019t want to be with them on his day off, I bet he rarely does anything fun or bonding with them. The disinterest &amp; lack of affection is palpable. I bet he treats children like they have no relevant thoughts or feelings &amp; aren\u2019t worth talking to. He might as well just have had pets instead of fathering kids. &amp; I\u2019m sure he\u2019d still neglect a pet anyway. \n\nSo the kids are not only treated as an inconvenience at home, their father has no desire to put effort into parenting, treats his wife like her sole purpose in life is to do his bidding/make his life as convenient &amp; easy as possible, &amp; in lieu of his wife\u2019s availability, her sister should fill the void &amp; do so without complaint. What a wonderful influence this man is- the treatment of others, particularly his opinion of a woman\u2019s lesser value, is something his kids will be observing &amp; absorbing as they grow up. Chances are good they will want little to do with him when they are older but they also might subconsciously learn to emulate him &amp; believe his attitude is acceptable &amp; standard. He could seriously damage their sense of self worth, &amp; their abilities to form healthy, respectful relationships with friends, romantic partners &amp; family alike. \n\nI can\u2019t begin to imagine why his wife puts up with him or defends him. Maybe she believes men are superior to women, maybe she has self hating sexist views herself, maybe she\u2019s brainwashed or abused- it\u2019s impossible to know really. But if she doesn\u2019t demand equal respect, partnership, &amp; parenting from this pathetic excuse of a husband &amp; father, she is doing her children a massive disservice. She has also totally disrespected OP, &amp; shown a complete lack of appreciation or defence of her younger sister, who was trying to be helpful. OP\u2019s mum clearly has some old fashioned women are less than men warped sensibilities. \n\nThe dad of OP seems to be the only parent with a firm grasp of reality in this situation. Laughing at the ludicrousness of his son in law\u2019s indignation &amp; reassuring OP she is exactly right, is the most appropriate reaction really. The other adults should be embarrassed &amp; OP should ignore the lot of them, except for her very chill &amp; reasonable sounding father. \n\nThe obnoxiousness &amp; selfishness from this lazy \u2018babysitting not co parenting\u2019 man is astounding. He sounds deserving of less than respect, but should have his worthlessness pointed out repeatedly. What does he have to offer his family besides complete apathy &amp; a misplaced sense of superiority. Appalling excuse for a adult, let alone partner or father. I\u2019m disgusted.",

He got what he deserved then he kicked you out and make your sister come back from making money so he could play more video games. I think your sister needs to wise up and get away from him since he obviously wants to play to make the babys but not take care of the consequences of his actions.

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nThis happened quite a while ago and I do have thoughts that maybe I am the A but I\u2019m not sure.\n\nSo my ex and I at the time were already going through some problems and our relationship was already on the decline. To preface both of us were in our early 20s and not exactly financially stable. Both of us were in debt and promised each other that we would save up money to be more financially responsible.\n\nWhile I was saving my money and accumulating a decent amount of savings my ex did so for only about three months before one day at 9pm she calls me and tells me that she is going to purchase a cat for about $950. I remind her about our financial situation and I warned her that having a pet required a lot of responsibility and that she needed to do some research before getting a cat but she didn\u2019t listen and purchased the cat anyways. Something that upset me a bit was that the main reason she wanted this cat was because it was the same breed Taylor Swift has. I text her that I\u2019m going to bed and that she should do some research regarding how to raise a pet along with telling her that she needs to go purchase some necessities in the morning such as food, litter box, water and food bowls etc.\n\nWhen I wake up the next day at noon I receive a long text from her about how much she hates having a cat and how she wants to sell the cat or rehome her because she hates every single aspect about having a cat.\n\nI express to her how disappointed I am for treating a life as if it was disposable. Keep in mind that she hasn\u2019t even had the cat for 24 hours and she has already given up on her. Fast forward a week she still hasn\u2019t found anyone to purchase the cat or rehome her so I tell her that I will take care of the cat and give her a home myself. At the time I agreed to pay the price of the cat so that she can get her money back.\n\nWe end up breaking up partially because of the cat, and also our incompatible lifestyles on the day that I went to pick up the cat.\n\nA week later, I take the cat to a vet and find out that the cat had a lot of health issues such as fleas worms and the fact that she was also 2 kg underweight. I end up paying over $1000 in vet fees for dewormers anti-flea treatment and special food for the cat along with poop tests and scans as the cat was having diarrhoea and vomiting every day. Because of this, I told my ex that I don\u2019t think it is right that I should have to pay her for the cat when I\u2019m spending so much just to get her back up and running and technically I was saving her money since she never took the cat to the vet which she would eventually have to anyways to which she obviously was very upset about and we exchanged some harsh words towards each other which made me eventually block her on everything.\n\nShe said that I\u2019m practically doing what she did by backing out of paying for the cat \n\nSo what are you guys think?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Same with meds. Ultrasound is usually done by an expert who comes in weekly but she ran one for \u00a310 over Hilbert yesterday as looking for constipation or gross mass.

It lost two kilos, and picked up worms and fleas in the single week she had it? That seems pretty unlikely. Worms and fleas don't just come out of nowhere, it seems really unlucky for the poor little thing to encounter both over the course of one week. Although it depends on how often your cat was outside and the density of flea-carrying animals and intestinal worm carrying animals in the area. If she was already sick, your ex should have taken it up with them. (Note that reputable breeders will usually accept their animals back if they customer changes their mind)\n\nGood on you for attempting to warn your ex away from making this mistake, and extra good on you for rescuing and looking after the poor critter.\n\nYou were NTA.",

If I am  correct about the time line, she bought a cat that had worms and fleas. You entered a purchase agreement with her. You got the cat, didn't pay, and now it has vet bills. I'm not sure how you think this saves her money. You didn't pay for the cat. She bought a sick cat, just like you did. You did the smart thing and took your new pet to the vet. If you want some sort of monetary help with the bill, contact the breeder. I could understand asking to negotiate the cost of the actual cat. Not vet bills. The cat is your responsibility.

Thats assuming she would even take her to the vet anyways which she probably wouldn't have so i guess she wouldn't be saving money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want any monetary help and even if I did theres no way of contacting the original owner cause my ex can't get into contact with them\n\n  \nThis actually happened like 10 months ago and my cat is very healthy and living a good life now but it still crossed my mind every once in a while which is why I wanted to see if I was the Asshole",

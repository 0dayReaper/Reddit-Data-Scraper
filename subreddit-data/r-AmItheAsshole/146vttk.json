    "postText": "Yesterday my (17f) brother (27) brought his girlfriend M (26) of three months over for dinner to introduce her to our mom and I. She was nice enough at first and I thought we\u2019d get along.\n\nNow, I collect musical boxes. Those that you start up by twisting a little handle and then music plays and sometimes there\u2019s a little figure on top that dances. I have 15 so far, some are very old and even valuable, and I love them very much. They are on a shelf with a glass front in my room. I had left my door open and while my brother was preparing dinner (he loves cooking) M went to the bathroom and saw them in my room. She asked if she could look at them and I allowed it of course. But then she simply took one out and shook it. I told her to not do that and to put it back please and she put it down very harshly and knocked another one over. I asked her not to touch them if she couldn\u2019t be careful and she snapped at me and told me they were ugly so I shouldn\u2019t care so much and that I was \u201ctoo young to be collecting such shit\u201d. I got upset and told her too leave my room but she took another one and asked if she could sell them on eBay for me. I told her no and she dropped the box. It wasn\u2019t an old one and didn\u2019t break but I was upset and kicked her out my room. We didn\u2019t talk much during dinner.   \nWhen M was gone my brother asked if we liked her. I said no and told him what happened. He said I\u2019m too sensitive and called me an AH because I judged her even though I barely knew her. My mom agrees. AITA?",

She was nice enough at first and I thought we\u2019d get along.\n\nNow, I collect musical boxes. Those that you start up by twisting a little handle and then music plays and sometimes there\u2019s a little figure on top that dances. I have 15 so far, some are very old and even valuable, and I love them very much. They are on a shelf with a glass front in my room. I had left my door open and while my brother was preparing dinner (he loves cooking) M went to the bathroom and saw them in my room. She asked if she could look at them and I allowed it of course. But then she simply took one out and shook it. I told her to not do that and to put it back please and she put it down very harshly and knocked another one over. I asked her not to touch them if she couldn\u2019t be careful and she snapped at me and told me they were ugly so I shouldn\u2019t care so much and that I was \u201ctoo young to be collecting such shit\u201d. I got upset and told her too leave my room but she took another one and asked if she could sell them on eBay for me. I told her no and she dropped the box. It wasn\u2019t an old one and didn\u2019t break but I was upset and kicked her out my room. We didn\u2019t talk much during dinner.   \nWhen M was gone my brother asked if we liked her. I said no and told him what happened. He said I\u2019m too sensitive and called me an AH because I judged her even though I barely knew her. My mom agrees. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

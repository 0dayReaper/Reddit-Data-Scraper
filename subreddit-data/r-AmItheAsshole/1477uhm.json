You can make it more autonomous by assigning values to the chores and making it more about everyone choosing the way they can contribute equitably to the household in an agreed upon time frame.\n\nYou could make it fun too? A race to see who can rack up the most points. Winner gets to decide what all household \"fun money\" goes to for the week/month or winner gets to pick the takeout or streaming for the week. You can put daily caps on points so it's more about building skills to clean daily and have a qualifying point level for people to participate in said \"fun\" prize or whatever.\n\nBottom line, division of labor is a huge contention point for many households. This includes the management and mental labor of planning things for tasks and household needs. The more automatic and habitual this can be, the better it makes everything for everyone. Everyone needs to contribute as equally as possible, and if they can't get with the program, then other more serious feelings and decisions will have to be dealt with in some way.\n\nObligatory NTA",

But  if he calls his mommy,  she cannot criticize you for your housework skills on her son's week because,  clearly,  she didn't do her job right or she wouldn't be doing his chores for him. \n\nOR, you can do ALL the chores *together,* like parents do when they are teaching their children how to clean house. (Don't tell him this is why you want to work together. ) When you're in the bathroom,  he cleans the mirror while you're cleaning the toilet.  He scrubs the sink while you clean the shower,  etc. When he quits, you quit. So,  if the toilet doesn't get done,  it stays dirty until the next time you clean together. \n\nOR, you can say,  \"Oh, I  didn't realize refusing to do chores was an option. *I can refuse to do chores, too!\" And then do just that! When he's willing to start cleaning with you,  then you start doing chores again.  Good luck!",

We both work full-time jobs, but i also take care of most of the household chores such as cooking, cleaning, and laundry. I've asked my husband to help out more in the past, but he always seems to find a excuse or says he's to busy with work.\n\n\n Recently we got into a heated argument about the division of household chores. I told him that I'm tired of doing everything and that i need him to step up and take on some responsibilities. He said that he's already doing as much as he can and that i need to be more understanding.\n\n\n I suggested that we make a chore chart or schedule to divide up the tasks more evenly, but he refused. He said that it's not fair for him to have to do things he doesn't enjoy, like cleaning the bathroom, when i get to do things i like, such as cooking. \n\nI got frustrated and told him that he's being selfish and lazy, and that he needs to stop making up excuses. After i said that, i also told him that i hate doing the laundry but i still do it. He got angry called me a-hole and stormed out of the room.\n\n\nNow I'm feeling guilty and wondering if I'm the asshole for not wanting to compromise with my spouse\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "postText": "My parents have always put my sister Cassie first. Cassie did need extra support, as she does have genuine issues with depression and anxiety. But they refused to compromise; It always came at my expense. The final straw was my high school graduation back in 2019. Cassie had a pageant at the same time. The plan was for both of our parents to attend the first half of Cassie\u2019s pageant, our mother would stay at Cassie\u2019s pageant, and our dad would leave to attend and record my graduation. Before Dad was about to leave, Cassie said she was having anxiety and needed them both there. He texted me to find my own ride home from graduation. I had been so hopefully that my parents would finally follow through with their promise to be there for me. In the honors sector class photo, I was the only student who didn\u2019t have any family members come. I felt awful. My mother, Dad, and Cassie were already home when I got back. They had ordered dinner and were celebrating Cassie\u2019s pageant, they didn\u2019t even seem to remember or care about me and my graduation. My parents tried to act friendly and congratulate me but I ignored them. My mother tried hugging me but I pushed past her. I decided then that I just couldn\u2019t depend on them not to disappoint me.\r  \n\r  \nMy graduation was three weeks ago. I didn\u2019t even bother reaching out to my mother, Dad, or Cassie. I gave my ceremony tickets to two friends and donated the rest. My mother and Dad reached out to me, saying they just learned about my ceremony through social media (neither of them went to college, so they assumed that the college got out at the same time as the local high schools.) They asked why I hadn\u2019t even asked them. I told them that they\u2019ve proven that I can\u2019t depend on them by always leaving me as a second thought to Cassie. I know she has issues and needs extra support, but they never even tried to compromise and I didn\u2019t want to deal with the disappointment again. My parents told me that they and Cassie were \u201cheartbroken\u201d that their daughter/sister would disregard them this way.\r  \n\r  \nWe do have other family members who my parents are much closer with after the pandemic. We were not really involved with each other before (which is why they weren\u2019t at my graduation, and why we didn\u2019t go to their kids\u2019 graduations.) They know both sides of the story, but told me I was an asshole. They said how my parents felt so bad about my high school graduation, and that I was being selfish and denied my parents the chance to make it right and finally be able to put their guilt behind them. I switched my social media to private to avoid these comments, but now I\u2019m worried that they\u2019re right and that I have been selfish/not understanding of Cassie\u2019s needs. AITA?\r  \n\r  \n**TLDR:** My parents have constantly prioritized my depressed/anxious sister over me, to the point of not even attending my high school graduation. Others are calling me selfish because I denied my parents the chance to make things right by inviting them to my college graduation.",

I didn't invite my parents or sister to my college graduation since they broke their promise to be there for my high school graduation.\n2. Other family members said I was being selfish to not even ask my parents or sister to attend. Because my parents felt so bad about not being at my high school graduation.

            "comment": "Absolutely, 100% NTA. Not even close, like not even a tiny bit. Why would you trust people who have consistently let you down and failed to celebrate your achievements? Even if your sister was genuinely having an anxiety attack and your dad decided to stay with her, why didn\u2019t they rush from her pageant to pick you up from graduation? Why did they celebrate her pageant (I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t the only one)? Why not wait for you? Why assume that college ended the same time as high school? Why did it not even cross their minds to think \u201cOP\u2019s graduating college this year, I wonder when it is?\u201d Why did it take seeing something on social media to make them reach out? \n\nThey aren\u2019t \u201cheartbroken\u201d at all. They are guilt-ridden. I can only assume that they didn\u2019t have the excuse of Cassie having an event to cover for them and are getting questions from other family members are rapidly doing damage control and trying to pin you as the bad guy.\n\nEdit: holy shit! Silver and a gold! Thank you whoever it was.",

Can't do the pageant without mom and dad? Sucks but your sister is graduating, so we'll be there at the next one. Then you ask yourself, why did the dad even need to start at the pageant? I still wouldn't like the compromise, but splitting the parents from the start was the least they could do. All of this seems so messed up from the getgo. \n\nOP, if this is just one of many examples as you say then... honestly, I might just block these people from my life. Move away, get married without inviting them, have my own family without them and just live a happier life. This might not amount to physical abuse, but this kind of behavior has a huge emotional impact, I'd get super depressed if my parents kept flaking on me and forgetting I even existed.",

When I showed up to give a campus tour in Sept, the President of my university handed me an envelope with a parking pass and other stuff for my dad. Graduation was up a big hill. This was all before October of senior year.\n\nI don\u2019t expect every parent to be like my dad.

Even you don't see how manipulative Cassie is... she attends pageants and then \"NEEDS!!\" both of her parents there? Cassie is a world class manipulator and even if she had anxiety and depression, I think she enjoys the benefits of having both conditions now. You will see her having anxiety attack right before you need any support from anyone around you. She will milk that well dry, and then latch on to the next saviour. I would feel a bit sad for your parents being in that position, because they don't see a way out...But don't buy that they were heartbroken ...Cassie would have needed them, and you know it so that is why you done what you've done. You should continue doing that until they get the hint of Cassie manipulation, which might be never. Look after you needs, because no one would otherwise. I would also be frank with them next time if they ask...:\"I didn't invite you to...whatever because I didn't want you missing Cassie pretentious timely hissy fit. It would liberate you from guilt that you are feeling. I am also sad for Cassie, because she cannot feel the joy for anyone. She learned to be the center of attention.",

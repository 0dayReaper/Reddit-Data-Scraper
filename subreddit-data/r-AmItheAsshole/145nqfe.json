    "postText": "My dad died, and I inherited around 540k (half tied up in a 10-year cap 401k I don't want to cash for strategic purposes from losing significant market value since 2021 and it being taxable). My mom got around 100k from the inheritance. I was going to visit my mom down south, and she said her rumatiod arthritis is getting really bad and asked how much money I'm bringing her. I was gonna give her 15k, and she jokingly, but not jokingly says, \"15k not 30k?\" My mom is also doing very well financially. She has a 300k home, a cushy remote bookkeeping job for Vovlo, 150k - 200k in the bank, and a husband with his own income stream. If my mom was in any financial trouble, I'd give her money in a heartbeat, but she's not. I'm a therapist and wanted to take a break while I wait for my professional license, which has a pending application. She told me it's a shame I'm wasting my inheritance. She said it's clear I don't want to give her any money and not to worry because I'll get plenty of money when she dies also.\n\nAITA for no longer wanting to give my mom any money at this point?",

No parent should make their child feel the way that she makes you feel. \n\nNo one can tell you how to have a relationship with your mother, but know you aren't being selfish and a normal mother should want their son to thrive. \n\nNTA but the amount you give her should be $0.

My mom got around 100k from the inheritance. I was going to visit my mom down south, and she said her rumatiod arthritis is getting really bad and asked how much money I'm bringing her. I was gonna give her 15k, and she jokingly, but not jokingly says, \"15k not 30k?\" My mom is also doing very well financially. She has a 300k home, a cushy remote bookkeeping job for Vovlo, 150k - 200k in the bank, and a husband with his own income stream. If my mom was in any financial trouble, I'd give her money in a heartbeat, but she's not. I'm a therapist and wanted to take a break while I wait for my professional license, which is pending application. She told me it's a shame I'm wasting my inheritance. She said it's clear I don't want to give her any money and not to worry because I'll get plenty of money when she dies also.\n\nAITA for no longer wanting to give my mom any money at this point?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

How is not handing her 30k \"wasting\" your inheritance? What's she gonna do with it? Buy gucci? Prada? Blow? Why does she need money if she's doing so well financially, and why are you giving her 15k short of covering some loan or some such she gave you?\n\nSeriously, she doesn't need financial support. What she needs is an attitude adjustment.\n\nNTA",

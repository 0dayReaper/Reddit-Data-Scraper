    "postText": "My three kids all have graduations this week.\n\nOne high school, one elementary and one preschool. \n\nMy high school son Liam said he has zero interest in going to his younger brothers' graduation because it's \"lame.\" I said his brothers are going to his and it's more work for them to go than for him to go to theirs.\n\nYesterday he said he's still not going. I said okay then you're not going on your senior trip to the Bahamas next week. He walked away without saying a word and went to his mom's. His mom then texted me about my being petty. I told her to mind her business. This has nothing to do with her. This is between our son and my other sons (half brothers to Liam).\n\nI texted him information about the graduations and haven't heard back. If he doesn't show up then I'll cancel his little school trip. He can go to his mom and she'll lie about how she doesn't have the money.",

We're not talking about food or shelter here, it's a luxury vacation that's basically to celebrate his graduation. I think there's a certain logic in saying that if he doesn't want to be part of the graduation celebrations for other family members then he can't expect to receive family money for a lavish celebration of his own.\n\nIf this was a punishment for something he already did then I would say it was over the top, but he has fair warning. If he thinks a few hours doing something nice for his little brothers is too high a price to pay for a Carribbean vacation then that's up to him, but the rest of adulthood is going to be a real shock.",

The way our family blended, I was able to more or less grow together naturally, and it sounds like your family also has a more natural relationship too. And when I can't make it to their stuff (because I have my own life), it's understood, like I just unfortunately missed my younger stepbro's hs graduation because I had to come back to school for a research grant. And it wasn't a big deal, even though everyone (myself included) was bummed it didn't work out.\n\nWhat the age gap and the fact that original mom are divorced is making me smell is that this is some sorta fantasy \"happy family\" thing the dad is pushing, where he probably tries to just force the kids together. Kid's probably acting out on principal because it's a control thing, not because going to the sibling's graduation is actually such a big deal",

You want him to follow YOUR rules, no questions asked. He's 18, of course he's not gonna be happy about going to a little kids graduation. But instead of talking to him like an adult (or even like a person you actually respect) you immediately put an ultimatum on him. Absolutely NOTHING in your post says anything about your children's relationships with each other, you seem to be trying to force a relationship that isn't there. Especially given that they're half brothers, there seems to be quite a bit of an age gap, so Liam was around for a while before the other two came around. Plus the clear disdain you have for his mother... None of his behaviour is surprising.\n\nUltimately you're gonna do what you want anyway.

It\u2019s may be stupid to you (general you, not OP), but adults still go to show support. That\u2019s the point. Not for you to have fun. These children aren\u2019t putting on a Broadway production.

And taking away his trip will only make him more resentful.

Because by that you can also say a high school graduation is a joke, just a \u201cparticipation award\u201d like everyone is saying about the younger ones. Completing a grade is just as important for a 5 year old as it is for 18. They still accomplished just as much as the high schooler, just in a more age appropriate level.\n\nAnd those saying \u201che shouldn\u2019t have to because they are just half siblings\u201d are heartless as well. Yes divorce and remarriage and half siblings  are complicated. But that is reinforcing the idea that split families are fake or not as real or not as important. They are still blood they are still family.\n\nHigh schooler can pay his way if we wants to go on his trip. You should not favor one kid or another and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. You would find the same age appropriate punishment for the youngers if they threw his attitude. The high schooler gets an age appropriate punishment as well.",

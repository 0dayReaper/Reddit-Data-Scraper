            "comment": "ESH. Your aunt shouldn't have continued offering help that wasn't wanted and your reaction was totally understandable, but you should still apologize. It can be very annoying to get unwanted help and if they're invading personal boundaries to offer unwanted help, you can explain why you can't have them helping with this. So you can say something like, \"I'm sorry I snapped/for my tone of voice but I'm not comfortable with people touching my bed/I wanted to practice making my bed/whatever your reason was.\"",

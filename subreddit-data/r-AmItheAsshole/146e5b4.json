I really don't get the full context of what the argument was about, BUT your question was if you were an ahole for telling your mom that your grandparents raised you. And if they did, then they did. She can hate it, hearing it, all she wants, but that doesn't change if it's true or not haha.",

My 5 month old was crying and I was sitting next to her trying to calm her down while I did so. My mom began yelling at me. I said I don't care about a comment my mom made and my step dad goes well that's obvious. I pointed out to my mom that sometimes babies cry for no reason. I knew nothing was wrong with my daughter because I was sitting right next to her. My mom goes I know babies sometimes cry for no reason I raised you and your sister. I was honestly so mad at her and my step dad at the time that I couldn't help but laugh and say you didn't raise us grandma and grandpa did. It lead to my mom screaming at me. For context my mom was always a when it is convient mom. Meaning when it was convient for her to raise us she did but when it no longer was convient for her to raise us or she wanted to party she sent us to our grandparents. When I was 16 my mom busted my lip. DCS told my mom I had to stay with my grandparents til I was 18.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

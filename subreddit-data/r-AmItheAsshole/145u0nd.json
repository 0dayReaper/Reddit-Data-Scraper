    "postText": "Sorry if typos, English isn't my first language.\n\nSome information first:\nMy (F30) nephew (M19) has just gotten a job and moved out from my sister's house and is now renting a room in a house with 1-2 others and he pays $340 a month for his own bedroom with space for his computer and he can use everything around the house as he wishes.\n\nI myself have an apartment with 2 bedrooms, one I use for office to work in and one for my bedroom. Reason I have the second room as a office is that I have 3 cats and 2 of them eats on cables.\n\nMy mom and my sister came to me last month asking if my nephew could live with me, at first I said yes, but I said he'd have to sleep on the couch as they said \"he's barely home anyway\"... Then, they told me he had to get one of the rooms because he's allergic to cats. I said absolutely not, I need my office and I'm not moving out of my bedroom. They claim it was for 5 months only, but with my sister expecting a child in her 2 bedroom house I feel it would be longer as there is no way he could move back in with them.\n\n\nAITA for saying absolutely not to him moving in?",

The action that I would be taking is spending 3/5 of my days off to myself and neglecting my bf\u2019s desire to spend time with me \n2.

The comments asking why you\u2019re in a relationship are ridiculous. You\u2019re not married with kids, you don\u2019t owe your time to anyone. I can understand your bf\u2019s disappointment at not being able to spend more time with you, but you don\u2019t have to prioritize him 100% of the time (of your days off) and it doesn\u2019t make you a bad partner to put yourself first. If you\u2019ve developed a pattern in your relationship of him feeling neglected in some way, then yeah, ofc address that\u2014but based on what you wrote, you sound like a caring person trying to do self-care and avoid burnout. That absolutely does NOT make you TA. Good luck",

We are both emergency first responders seasonally; we live together in the winter but in the summer we live 6 hours apart. I am just getting home after over 5weeks of work: long days of physical labor with no days off, very little solitude, camping and no amenities. (It\u2019s a fun job I promise). When I get home I\u2019ll have ~5 days off before I go right back to work. \n\nI would like to spend this time on myself. Call me selfish, but I have a whole list of decompression activities that I am looking forward to. Some are important (doctors appt, errands) and some are leisurely (reading in the park, getting a massage, sleeping in). I mentioned to BF that I would like 2-3 to myself and he\u2026did not take it well. \n\nFrom his perspective, we haven\u2019t seen each other in a long amount of time and he wants to spend every minute with me. From my perspective, I spend all my free time with him when we live together in the winter and I have other parts of my life I enjoy and, frankly, need to feel happy and fulfilled. I am worried that I am being a shitty girlfriend by not prioritizing him (his words) but boy do I really want to prioritize myself just a little for once. It\u2019s been a hard month. WIBTA if I only gave him a small portion of my time off?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

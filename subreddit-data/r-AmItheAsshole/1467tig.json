So when I have marmite on toast I have to spread the butter on one slice, (all the way to the edge - no dry bits), and it has to be straight out the toaster so it melts. Then that piece has to go under the other piece of toast whilst the top one gets butter so the underneath butter melts into the toast, then swap. Whilst the other one is melting the marmite can go on the top piece, but it has to be a really specific amount. And if there\u2019s any area where the butter hasn\u2019t melted in I can\u2019t eat it cos I cannot cope with the spreads mixing to form a weird sludge. It\u2019s dumb.\n\nThe point is he would offer me toast and I\u2019d be like no don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll do it because it has to be this stupid weird way and he made me show him and learned how I like it even though I know it\u2019s dumb and shouldn\u2019t even matter. Because he\u2019s kind and cares about doing silly little sweet things just for me.",

Like, he was never someone who made big gestures, but just... he'd see something small that reminded him of someone he loved and so he'd get that thing for them, or he'd think of something that his loved one/friend would think funny, and would go and do that for them/send it to them.\n\nFor my mom it was often supermarket flowers. Not as an apology; just because he was there, and he saw them and thought she'd like them. And so of course she did!\n\nFor me and my sister, he used to cut our sandwiches in different shapes - both to relieve his own boredom and because he thought we'd get a giggle out of it. Then while I was at university, it was emails with cartoons he'd found online and thought would give me a giggle. (And the one time I left a soft toy at home that I'd meant to pack, he packed it up in a box - used sweets instead of packing peanuts, and then modified the box to look like a rocket!)\n\nAt work, a colleague once went to Australia for a year and gave the office a stuffed kangaroo toy to \"take his place on the team\". Dad sneaked the toy out of the office a couple of times so he could take photos of it in different places (and also could get some stock photos to photoshop it into pictures), then created a new anonymous email address and spent the next year sending his absent colleague periodic updates about what the kangaroo was getting up to. Highlights included a trip to a theme park (I and my university pals had visited it and come away with a rollercoaster photo that the kangaroo was promptly added to) and an unexpected wrestling match with a crocodile in a local duck pond (which definitely did not have a croc in it when the photo was first taken)!",

The fact that I don't like mayo on any other sandwich other than a BLT. And vice versa, I knew that he prefers mayo on sandwiches other than ham or smoked meat. He hates tea and isn't a big fan of coffee. Frig now, after being together for 20 years, he can just look at the time and make me a coffee or tea, lol. \n\n\nI can not fathom not taking the 2 seconds to comment to memory that your partner likes one sugar on their tea.",

That's for damn sure, but we have been together since we were teenagers, so there have definitely been some ups and downs. And even now, there are some days where I am at the end of my rope(thank god for therapy and reddit \ud83d\ude06)\n\nIt's no joke when people say relationships are work(marriage counselling and personal therapy is a god send), but the one thing that I grew up hearing is you try to fix what is broken before giving up(this is of course bar any abuse. Then you abandon ship) and that care, respect, and regular maintenance will keep things running for a long time(my dad is a car guy, and so was my grandfather lol). That is how my parents have treated their relationship and marriage they have been together coming up on 50 years this year and have been married for more than 35 years of that 50. They are who I hope to be like",

And I say that bearing in mind my Alexa cannot really understand my accent and my English BF bought me it more for the hilarity of the two of us essentially conversing at cross purposes. He asks me stuff like \u2018oh you might want to put an order on the Alexa. I just used up your paper towel\u2026\u2019\n\nFirst few times I thought he was being helpful if a little paternalistic. Then I realised he was trolling me gently. She\u2019s a handy third party for couples that way :)\n\nNTA.",

Does she actually care enough to do anything for you the way you want it, rather than the way she thinks it should be done? The answer seems to be \"no\".\n\nYou can have a tea war if you like, but the real question here is a fairly fundamental relationship question.

Our \"thing\" was teatime--once in a blue moon, we'd meet at one of our houses and whichever of us was hosting prepared tea, set out places, a pitcher of cream and sugar, and made a tea platter with 3-4 different homemade biscuits/tea sandwiches/pastries. Whoever came would usually bring her own sweet treat, and we'd sip our tea and chat for an hour or two. \n\nIn the three years I knew her, I hosted tea 6-10 times. She hosted once. When I asked her why, she responded \"Oh, well, we usually alternate these things, and my mom drove us somewhere once, so...\". As she later explained, it was a hastily-cobbled lie to cover the fact that her *mom* didn't want to bake the treats or do the cleaning for an event that week. The chores, that, for three years, I, another seventeen-year-old, had been doing myself. \n\nWhen asked even to involve herself more in our friendship because I was tired of extending all the effort, she stressed out and, long story short, our friendship broke apart. It's for the best, I think. \n\nWithholding judgement, but why don't you just have the tea brought out with a sugar bowl?",

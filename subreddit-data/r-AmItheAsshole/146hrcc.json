    "postText": "My boyfriend is in prison. He got accused for something he didn't do and they put him on investigation, during which we were unable to communicate. They blocked my number, because I was implicated in the false accusation (it was all expunged on Monday because they found no proof), and we couldn't have any video visits or emails. This lasted for 2 weeks.\n\nHe ended up being charged for something else and they put him in seg. There's still no phone calls or video visits, but we can email and he can have in person visits.\n\nDuring this time, the place I work at decided to completely cut out my shift and drop down to two 10hr shifts. My current shift is 2pm-10:30pm but I'll be switching to 8pm-6:30am.\n\nI told my boyfriend that once I adjusted to 3rds, then I'd schedule a visit to come see him. It's a completely new routine, I've never worked 3rd/graveyard shift before and even tho I usually stay up pretty late, I'm not used to staying up all night. It's a huge lifestyle and routine change and I wanted some time to adjust to it. The prison is about an hour away so I want to take the time to fully adjust so I'm not driving while I'm super tired.\n\nBut I got an email from him saying he was upset that I didn't just schedule a visit for Friday (the new schedule is Sunday night thru Thursday morning and I get Fridays off). He didn't understand why I wanted to take the time to adjust and said if I really wanted to see him then I should've immediately scheduled a visit like his mom did.\n\nAITA for wanting to wait a week to see him so I can adjust to my new schedule?\n\nEditing to add info: he's been in prison for 9yrs for something unrelated to this incident. I met him while he was already in prison. \n\nI don't know how this accusation came out, but either an inmate or an officer accused him of conspiring with another inmate (someone he had never heard of) and \"a female\" to smuggle drugs into the prison. After they listened to our phone calls and drug tested him, they realized it wasn't true and it was all expunged. The only thing they found him guilty of was moving money (he gets himself into debts and I pay it off for him)",

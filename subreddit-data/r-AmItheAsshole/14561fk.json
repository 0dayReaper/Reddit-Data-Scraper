    "postText": "So, for context, my (28f) brother (29m) has been staying with me for free for a little over 3 months. He doesn\u2019t have a job and is starting flight school in an area near my house. Things have been tense because he has a hard time being respectful of my space. \n\nLast night, as I\u2019m on my way home from work I called him and asked if he needed anything from the grocery. He asked me to get him all the ingredients to make sandwiches with (deli meats, cheese, bread, etc.). I bought him all the things he asked for in addition to the supplies I needed to make dinner. \n\nI get home and make a delicious dinner (cauliflower parm and pasta with homemade tomato sauce) that takes me almost 2 hours to complete. I made enough so both he and I could have a portion and I would have a leftover portion to eat for lunch today, since I have a busy day ahead of me and want a quick lunch I can microwave in a minute. \n\nHe finished his portion, looks at the pot with the leftovers in it and then TELLS ME, DOES NOT ASK, that he is going to eat the rest of the pot because he is still hungry. I told him no, I want the leftovers for tomorrow and he can make himself a sandwich if he\u2019s still hungry (he didn\u2019t pay me for the sandwich supplies either). \n\nHe then proceeds to get pissed and argue with me about how I\u2019m being selfish. He tells me to have fun doing all the dishes by myself, mimics my response like a 10 year old, and throws his dish in the sink. He called me a selfish asshole and a bitch before he went upstairs to slam the door to his room. Haven\u2019t spoken to him since. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in the wrong here. He\u2019s making me feel insanely guilty about this, so AITA for keeping the leftovers for myself?",

He doesn\u2019t have a job and is starting flight school in an area near my house. Things have been tense because he has a hard time being respectful of my space. \n\nLast night, as I\u2019m on my way home from work I called him and asked if he needed anything from the grocery. He asked me to get him all the ingredients to make sandwiches with (deli meats, cheese, bread, etc.). I bought him all the things he asked for in addition to the supplies I needed to make dinner. \n\nI get home and make a delicious dinner (cauliflower parm and pasta with homemade tomato sauce) that takes me almost 2 hours to complete. I made enough so both he and I could have a portion and I would have a leftover portion to eat for lunch today, since I have a busy day ahead of me and want a quick lunch I can microwave in a minute. \n\nHe finished his portion, looks at the pot with the leftovers in it and then TELLS ME, DOES NOT ASK, that he is going to eat the rest of the pot because he is still hungry. I told him no, I want the leftovers for tomorrow and he can make himself a sandwich if he\u2019s still hungry (he didn\u2019t pay me for the sandwich supplies either). \n\nHe then proceeds to get pissed and argue with me about how I\u2019m being selfish. He tells me to have fun doing all the dishes by myself, mimics my response like a 10 year old, and throws his dish in the sink. He called me a selfish asshole and a bitch before he went upstairs to slam the door to his room. Haven\u2019t spoken to him since. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in the wrong here. He\u2019s making me feel insanely guilty about this, so AITA for keeping the leftovers for myself?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your brother is to \"cease and desist\".

The condo doesn't really belong to you OP....find one you can have 100% control of ( sooner rather than later because whoever raised your brother doesn't seem that nice either). You didn't give birth to him to stop playing mom and maid....he sees women as his mom and maid ( his future spouse is very unlucky). And you're obvious doing too much in your live in sibling relationship and he's just kicking back. Why are you letting him condition you into being his mom? You need to reflect on why you're okay with giving so much to someone who is clearly using you and doing nothing for you (this is not normal in any relationship). Why did you even tell him you were going to the the grocery store? Why did you buy him food??? Why make food for him and you?????? Too much for a whole grown parasitic guy who clearly hasn't been respecting you for 3 months since he moved in. Self respect always---even when others don't respect you.",

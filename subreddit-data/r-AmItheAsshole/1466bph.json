    "postText": "I (32 M) have a brother Ben (34 M) and best friend Mike (33 M). We all grew up together and were part of a close-knit friend group.  Mike is married to Lisa, and they have a 4yo daughter together.  Lisa is a little more sexually adventurous than Mike, but he\u2019s kept up with her appetites for the most part.\n\nAbout six months ago, Ben, Mike, and Lisa were hanging out and heavily drinking.  Mike was blitzed and close to passing out when Lisa and Ben started proposing the idea of a threesome. Mike was not interested at all, but they kept trying to change his mind and Mike eventually told them \u201cdo whatever you want because it doesn\u2019t sound like you care about my answer\u201d before passing out.  Mike woke up a few hours later to the sounds of loud sex in the other room.  He chose not to do anything about it at the time, but he was pretty upset.  \n\nShortly after the entanglement, Mike and Lisa separated.  They had other marital problems, but sex with his friend ended up being the final straw.  Mike and Ben had a major argument and haven\u2019t spoken since.  My friend group has stayed silent on the matter, but have essentially cut Ben out of our get-togethers.\n\nA couple weeks ago, my wife and I were throwing a birthday party for my daughter (5). We invited Mike and his daughter to attend (He\u2019s one of my best friends and our kids are very close). He\u2019s struggled since the separation, but is going through therapy and was getting to a good place mentally.\n\nOut of respect to Mike, I didn\u2019t invite my brother.  Ben had called about a week before the birthday and asked for the details. I told him that I was going to avoid an awkward situation and he could visit with his niece at a different time.  He got extremely upset and told our parents. My mom called and berated me about excluding my brother. I tried to explain the situation, but she didn\u2019t care (despite Mike being almost a son to her).  AITA for not inviting my brother to my daughter\u2019s bday?",

            "comment": "I would say NTA it may be an unpopular opinion but it really depends who you are closer to . I have seen friends being closer than blood relatives so I won't consider the whole just because he's your brother he's entitled to be there argument. Also considering the fact that Mike also has a daughter who I'm guessing is friends with your daughter as well, she would want her friend to be present at her birthday. \n\nBut again you could just invite both of them if they're equally important to you and ask them to be adults and not create a scene because how long are you going to keep not inviting your brother for family events and gatherings",

If I understand your post correctly your SIL cheated on her husband - your brother - with one of yours/his best friends and YOUR BROTHER is being ostracised from not only your friend group but also your child's birthday party??? Why the hell are you prioritising these people over your own family who actually requires support and love? \nI get it can be hard to choose sides sometimes, and I love my own BIL, but if he did that to my sister... I can't say what I'd do cos it would get me banned.\nYTA\u300b",

Like if Ben is married to Lisa why does OP say Mike has managed to keep up with Lisa's sexual appetite. And if Mike woke up to hearing Ben and Lisa have sex why should he care? It's a husband and wife having sex why is he upset?",

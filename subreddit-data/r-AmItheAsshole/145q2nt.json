    "postText": "My brother recently gone through a miscarriage while he was on vacation with his girlfriend. My grandmother was not in favor of this vacation. Mind you my brother is 38 years old. We grew up in the Philippines, so matriarchal culture is common.  So when they lost their baby, Grandma told few people that the reason they lost the baby its because my brother disobeyed her by going on this vacation. \nI called her out and told her that it was such an Evil thing to say, preposterous and ridiculous. Those words should not be even be said to a grieving person. Now she tells my whole family that I am very disrespectful and should be disowned. Am I the asshole here for talking back?",

            "comment": "NTA for speaking up in this situation. It's understandable that you felt the need to defend your brother and call out your grandmother for making hurtful and inappropriate comments during a time of grieving.\r  \n\r  \nLosing a baby is an incredibly painful experience, and it's crucial for family members to provide support and empathy rather than blaming or shaming. Your grandmother's comments were insensitive and lacked compassion, and you had every right to express your disapproval.\r Your reaction was a reflection of your care for your brother and your commitment to standing up against hurtful behavior.\r  \n\r  \nIt's unfortunate that your grandmother has responded by attempting to turn your family against you. It may be helpful to have a calm and open conversation with her, expressing your intentions and feelings, and seeking to find common ground. However, ultimately, it's up to your family to determine how they respond to the situation.\r  \n\r  \nIt's important to prioritize your own mental well-being and maintain boundaries if the situation becomes toxic or harmful. Surround yourself with supportive individuals who understand and respect your perspective.",

    "postText": "First time poster on this sub long time lurker. I'm on mobile so please forgive the mistake reddit lords. \n\nI 24F and my sister 17F have had our differences growing up. I have always been more studious and though I'm not a genius by any means I still tried hard in highschool and got into a good college. I was the first person in my immediate family to go to college as my family doesn't really talk to our extended side even though most of my cousins have gone college for good degrees. (Think medical and engineering). Before I went to college I told my parents of what my plan was and what future career I was planning on doing ahead of time. I researched the money the school would give me as well of help I needed financially. They agreed and said they will help me financially and I graduate with a stem degree in 4 years. I know some might say that might be the norm, but those stem courses were hard and I would struggle to understand a lot of concepts so I'm proud I finished. My sister is the opposite of me. She is VERY rebellious and hard headed. Throughout highschool she disregard my advice on what classes to take, people to hang out with and even testing advice. She would lie and steal often to the point where when my father passed away she would steal money from my parents joint bank account to buy dumb things like make up or food. My father died before he could figure it out it was her but my mom was broken down completely. Fast forward to today I've graduated college worked in my relevant field and I'm hoping to apply to my preferred graduate program soon. My mother who I've helped emotionally since my grandmothers death and my father's death still agreed to help me financially purse this program until I get in. My sister has now graduated highschool and has only go into one school in our state and 2 out of state. My sister has no goals she hasn't even looked at the college department/classes she will need to take for her degree as she is going undeclared. I told my mom to let her go to community college and commute from home but my sister is adamant that it \"will just be like highschool\" and doesn't want to do that. The school she got accepted to out of state is definitely a party school and I don't want my mom to waste money on my sister since my sister doesn't have an academic plan or drivers license( she failed her permit test 6 times). My family and now my mom said since my parents paid for my education and are still helping me then my sister should go out of state. Aita?",

If she wants to make mistakes, let her! She\u2019s 17! But if she\u2019s looking at out of state schools, she likely wants to get away from home, and you trying to block that\u2026 that\u2019s really even worse than trying to control her.",

I was working trying to get relevant experience in the industry I'm trying to break into and though it's not a lot of money my mom said I could live at home rent free so I saved. I've paid for food, clothes and routinely drove her places when I lived at home. She likes to go online shopping a lot and I've even paid for stuff she wanted to get even though she has used my card without my permission multiple times. If I get into my grad program I would be on my own my mom stated that and honestly I would be fine for the most part even if I will be in debt. I've even thought of apply to programs in the state my sister wants to go to college just so I can keep an eye on her. I can't pay for her entire college education but I still want to offer guidance. I'm in a post bacc right now and even got a nice scholarship which I gladly used a part of to contribute for a down payment for a new car for her. During her highschool days it was my mom begging me to give her advice on what kind of classes my sister needs to take and she consistently failed, cheated and would often argue with teachers about her lack of attendance. I still love my sister and just want her to go in state to save money so when she does figure what she wants she won't have this huge debt on her.",

The tutoring service for her specifically started while I was in college and when my dad was alive. It continued when I was out of college and working while living at home. When my dad passed my mom was still paying for it. The service was a physical person would come and help her with homework and if she had questions she would ask them while the subscription was like chegg which she asked me to get her and I agreed it would be helpful. My mother was the one who was adamant that both  were a good idea despite the cost and would often pay for the majority of the services and sometimes reimbursed me for paying the monthly subscription. We all agreed that my sister needed tutoring including my sister. She was never forth coming about her grades and when my mom forced my sister to show her grades and saw she was flunking majority of her classes even with the tutoring service my mom was paying thousands for my sister said she also needed chegg which I offered to help with paying since I was working and staying at home. When my dad passed bills start to pile and my mom was obviously stressed so I offered to at least help with the tutoring service cost as well until my sister graduated. I found this tutoring service in my senior year and only had it for one semester. My parents liked the tutor so the enrolled for sister when she was at least a sophomore and had continuously paid for it. I told my parents that I didn't think the service would fit my sisters needs but they said they didn't care and said if it worked for me in that short of a time then it will help my sister.  My sister only asked for the tutor subscription ( chegg) in her senior year.",

I know I've had privileges I'm not denying that but I also know that my sister is naive about the whole undergrad finances process and my mom is the one who is asking me to explain things to her or give her some perspective. Both of my parents made it clear that the value higher education will help both of us. My sister just hasn't been forthcoming with her grades in highschool so my mom was worried if she will continue that pattern in college which I think so but who knows maybe she will change.

My mom wanted to get my advice so I told her that since my sister had no real academic plans with her history of stealing/lie to my mom consistently can we really trust her to be studious in school. Both me and my sister had tutors during highschool and it was me who beg to get said tutoring service because I knew I needed it and my parents like that I got to college with it so they enrolled her as well. All I'm saying is that I'm looking out for her and I don't want her saddled with debt and no real way to pay it off since her only answer to what she wants to do in the future is \" not be like you and keep going to school but making real money\". My dad life insurance helped pay off my remaining debt as well as my mother's and other expenses.",

I've used said money to help pay for a tutoring service as well as tutoring subscriptions that she used when she was in highschool. Mom said I didn't need to pay rent when I was working so I saved a lot and would often pay for small things my sister wanted like food or clothes. My sister would online shop a lot and would even take my card without my permission but I still paid for things if she asked me. I don't want to seem like I'm controlling I just want to offer my sister guidance as she would save a lot more money and even get some refund back if she stayed in state. Then she could save as she won't worry about rent if she lived at home and she could work if she wanted to not that I would judge her if she didn't.  Also the college I went to was instate.",

Mom handled all finances I'm that regard I couldn't touch at all and my mom was the main bread winner in the home anyway. She decided where the money went and she got herself a new car paid full as well as paying off other expenses. She didn't tell me the full details just that my little undergrad debt is paid for. My sister was 16 at that time. My mom has routinely complained to her to talk to me about college when she was a junior and my mom begged me to talk to her about my sister's career goals. All my sister has told my mom and me that she wanted to go into computer science specifically IT. Then she changed her mind again to English then back to IT. I said that she doesn't need to go to a 4 year for IT and since my sister is adamant that she \" doesn't really care what she does as long as she gets money\" which I said ok then go to community stay close to home and save.  My mom for some reason hates the idea of community college saying it's not a \"real degree\" I told my mom my sister can transfer and that if she changes her mind on her degree at least she won't have any real debt to pay for. My mom said I was discouraging my sister and my sister isn't aiming high enough. I understand my sister is still figuring out but I know things change a lot with my sister and with college those changes stack up I just don't want her to struggle too much. I could care less what kind of degree she gets but I would like to see her pursue college as it will help in the future. I don't see how that's controlling. I've definitely made some bumps on the road but I know I'm different than her and I planned ahead for those bumps and made some adjustments to my course but my goal is still the same.",

My mom often bugs me with questions regarding sisters education and what would be the best course she could take. My mom has told me once I get into the graduate program I'm applying for I'm on my own financially and informed her I'm well aware I will be in debt. After college I was working in my relevant field to gain more experience and I didn't have enough money to move into my own place. My mom stated I didn't need to pay rent and I my sister would often times come ask me to pay for clothes food and other things she wanted. Teenager things. I didn't mind at all. When my mom said my sister wanted a tutoring service I paid for it to help her with her homework. My mom would ask me constantly if my sister had a chance of going to the college I went to because throughout my sister highschool years she would flunk class or just not show up. This was during the pandemic when all her classes were online. I literally had to take her final for her for one of her classes after my sister stated she was going to fail again. My mom panicked and begged me to help with that by just taking it for her. \n\nMy sister was interested in going into community college and she wanted a job but it was my mom who wanted her to focus on her highschool classes because she was literally flunking them. I tried to convince my mom that community or trade school is not bad at all and my sister doesn't need to go the exact route as me but my mom took that as an offense and stated I'm trying to discourage my sister from applying to a 4 year. I gave my advice when I was asked and my opinion. I've explained my reasoning to my sister multiple times and even tried to get in contact with an old advisor. My sister still just wants to go out of state and even if hae has to go into debt and will figure it out as she goes. The 4 year instate school that my sister got into isn't that great and she has expressed she is embarrassed to go there but I told her she could always transfer. Plus she would save a lot more money and even get some back. The school I went to was also instate as well as my post bacc program.",

I'm not saying my opinion matters more I have my opinion when my mom asked.

Your sister may be not very intelligent, not goal oriented, and she\u2019s made some bad mistakes but it\u2019s time for her to be allowed to make some decisions about her own life. You\u2019ve given your mom your advice but it is time for the Golden Child to *back off.* Your mother has paid for many years of your education and now you want your sister to stay at home, get a job and attend community college. Your stance leaves a sour taste in my mouth.",

Or just because it\u2019s none of your business? Or because she\u2019s afraid of committing to something and then failing?\n\nOr maybe she just legitimately doesn\u2019t know what she wants to do with the rest of her life. I didn\u2019t. I went to college undeclared and tested out several different majors and minors. And I still graduated on time with all of my requirements met.\n\nThe stealing is legitimately a problem, but besides that she\u2019s not doing anything wrong, just different from you. And I\u2019m sorry that your mom is alone in this, but she needs to parent her. That\u2019s not your job.",

If your sister truly has no goals and no drive to work for her grades, she'll drop out or be kicked out within a year. Your mom might lose 2 semesters worth of tuition but shell at lradt get an idea of what shes working with and can make plans based on that.",

I'm on mobile so please forgive the mistake reddit lords. \n\nI 24F and my sister 17F have had our differences growing up. I have always been more studious and though I'm not a genius by any means I still tried hard in highschool and got into a good college. I was the first person in my immediate family to go to college as my family doesn't really talk to our extended side even though most of my cousins have gone college for good degrees. (Think medical and engineering). Before I went to college I told my parents of what my plan was and what future career I was planning on doing ahead of time. I researched the money the school would give me as well of help I needed financially. They agreed and said they will help me financially and I graduate with a stem degree in 4 years. I know some might say that might be the norm, but those stem courses were hard and I would struggle to understand a lot of concepts so I'm proud I finished. My sister is the opposite of me. She is VERY rebellious and hard headed. Throughout highschool she disregard my advice on what classes to take, people to hang out with and even testing advice. She would lie and steal often to the point where when my father passed away she would steal money from my parents joint bank account to buy dumb things like make up or food. My father died before he could figure it out it was her but my mom was broken down completely. Fast forward to today I've graduated college worked in my relevant field and I'm hoping to apply to my preferred graduate program soon. My mother who I've helped emotionally since my grandmothers death and my father's death still agreed to help me financially purse this program until I get in. My sister has now graduated highschool and has only go into one school in our state and 2 out of state. My sister has no goals she hasn't even looked at the college department/classes she will need to take for her degree as she is going undeclared. I told my mom to let her go to community college and commute from home but my sister is adamant that it \"will just be like highschool\" and doesn't want to do that. The school she got accepted to out of state is definitely a party school and I don't want my mom to waste money on my sister since my sister doesn't have an academic plan or drivers license( she failed her permit test 6 times). My family and now my mom said since my parents paid for my education and are still helping me then my sister should go out of state. Aita?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I would say though that you may be saying it in a way that makes you the AH.\n\nDon't push your sister or mom too much just cause you think you know the best for her. Often, we don't know what another person's real plans are, no matter how much we think we are close to them. And it seems like you have little to no faith in your sister... which is fair, but it might be affecting how you are communicating your advice.\n\nI see that you care about your mom, your sister and your family's finances. But pushing both of them to decide based on what you think is right, instead of just communicating to them your concerns, is not the right way to go about it.",

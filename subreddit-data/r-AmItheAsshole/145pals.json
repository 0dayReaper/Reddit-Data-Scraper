    "postText": "My grandpa has fell down the facebook rabbit hole of arguing with everyone who has a different political beliefs. \nHe must have pissed someone off because he got doxxed in the comments with his address and phone number so he was feeling unsafe on Facebook. Work for a law office and I\u2019m not an attorney and my grandpa was all about suing or pressing charges on this person. I told my grandpa there\u2019s not really anything he can do because it was a troll account. He did even try going to the police about it but obviously nothing is going to be done. I tried telling my grandpa maybe he should lock down all off the information on his account and make it private if he\u2019s going to argue with people online. He turned on me saying Facebook shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do it and I should use my computer at work to skip trace the person who did it. I tried explaining again it\u2019s a troll account and my grandparents and parents think I\u2019m an asshole because I\u2019m not doing more to help my grandpa",

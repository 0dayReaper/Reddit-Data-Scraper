We have a good time and have some drinks at the beach. We go out to eat then head home. One of my buddy\u2019s keeps drinking on the way home and gets pretty intoxicated. When we almost get home, I see he\u2019s like laid back but his mouth is open and his eyes are partially open and I try to wake him up. I\u2019m trying to talk to him and the person sitting next to us says he\u2019s fine and they\u2019re just gonna take him back to his room and let him be. I did t like that and thought he needed to get out and at least somewhat get help and try to revive him a bit. The driver pulls over and he hood out of the car and I help him sit down at a curb by this gas station and everyone starts freaking out and bystanders are trying to help him. Splashed water on him and at this point those bystanders knew he was just drunk. They ask if we need 911 I said no don\u2019t do that he\u2019s fine we got it taken care of. Everybody but me and the guy that\u2019s drunk gets back in the car and leaves. They come back a few minutes later and grab him but they all leave me at the gas station. Next day, they are all pissed off at me saying I effed up and how the guy who\u2019s leaving doesn\u2019t want to talk to me anymore.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why not try to get him to liven up while still heading towards your direction? \n\nThat way the car could drive to an emergency room if need be (possibly faster than waiting for an ambulance), and you'd both be safe in the hotel with the staff to help out instead of in public amongst strangers.",

Hope that gives some info",

That they abandoned you is the confirmation.",

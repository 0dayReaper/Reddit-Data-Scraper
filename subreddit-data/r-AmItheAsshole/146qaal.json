    "postText": "I have a cousin who is around the same age as my son (son is 8, cousin is 11). They used to be good playmates as kids, but a bit before the pandemic my cousin started being weirdly antagonistic. There's nothing that I can directly call bullying, just a general bad attitude that I can tell hurts my son. For example, we really like listening to Taylor Swift together, but my cousin told my son that her music is terrible and \"if you listen to it, you're an NPC\". Or, when my son eats nuts as a snack, my cousin calls him a rabbit. It's just small comments that these that aren't outright bullying or anything, just a bit mean. It breaks my heart because after they hang out, my son would come to me and ask if whatever my cousin made fun of is a weird or bad thing to do, and I have to assure him that he's fine and normal the way he is. I've tried to talk to my cousin before too, but he just says something along the lines of \"you're not my mom\" or ignores me.\n\nI've tried to talk to his mother (my SIL) about it, but she's significantly older than me and she just brushes me off and says I'm too sensitive as a \"new\" mom, let the kids grow up and sort themselves out, etc.\n\nUsually they hang out every Saturday at my house to play, but this weekend I decided I had enough and that he cant come over. Now, it seems that no one is happy. My SIL complained to me about it, my son is sad because he likes playing with my cousin, and my husband says he's staying out of it but that he \"wished i would prioritize my son's happiness.\" I know my son likes hanging around my cousin, but I just think it does more harm than good for him.\n\nAITA?  \n\n\nEdit: Sorry for the confusion, My SIL is my husband's aunt, but I call her my SIL for simplicity. My husband's family speaks Viet, so I've always referred to her as \"Chi,\" and my cousin as \"em.\" Not sure what to call them in English. ",

There is a significant difference between those ages, as there is now between 11 and 8. \n\nYour son seems to enjoy playing with his cousin, but the cousin needs to respect the rules of your house. If he wants to come over and play, then he needs to be polite to everyone, including your son. \u2018Your roof, your rules.\u2019\n\nI think SIL is the AH here. If she\u2019s upset about your decision, then she needs to make adjustments with her son to address your concerns. Even though the antagonism is mild, it\u2019s still there. \n\nAlso INFO: I\u2019m trying to figure out how your SIL is the mother of your cousin. Wouldn\u2019t that make her the wife of your brother, and make her son your nephew?",

Leaving him in that situation risks your son deciding to do that to people too. He might need someone near his age that isn't an AH. Also, I could 100% believe your son being fine with it because he likes hanging out with an 11 year old and 8 is an age where 2 years older seams way older and way cooler than another 8 year old. It might be harsh to call the 11 year old an AH but he would be considered one if he was older and that needs to be curbed before it becomes too much of how he is as a person to change",

He doesn\u2019t have to keep running back to this kid out of habit.\n\nMy 8 year old has such a need to be liked by everyone. So I got really upset when she kept running back to this group of kids that did not like her at all and said nasty things to her. She eventually told me \u201cI don\u2019t care if they\u2019re mean to me - maybe I don\u2019t deserve nice friends. It\u2019s still better to have people to play with.\u201d  Had to have a long talk about self worth and she wasn\u2019t allowed to see them until they learned to treat her better. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing how quickly they internalize these negative comments.

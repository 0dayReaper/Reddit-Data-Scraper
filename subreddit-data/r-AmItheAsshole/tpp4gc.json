    "postText": "This is a short one. Names changed for privacy. \n\nI went to a tattoo shop in my area, with a photo of the tattoo I wanted. It was one my dad had gotten to honor my passed grandfather who\u2019s father also had it. But the point is - it was important to me that the tattoo looked EXACTLY as it did in the photo. \n\nI get to the shop, I explain everything, I pay, get the tattoo, and we\u2019re done, I think it looks awesome, everything is great! Until a few weeks later when I show my great grandmother the tattoo. She\u2019s static, grabs my arm to look at and compliment it, then asks, \u201cWho\u2019s AJ?\u201d \n\nI ask her what she means, and she points out on the tattoo where the initials A and J or maybe T were hidden into the tattoo. I\u2019m instantly pissed, as my artists name is Alice Trever. She tries to assure me it\u2019s no big deal if I hadn\u2019t noticed it til now, but I still reached out to the artist sort of irritated. They told me the style of art I got is called traditional and it\u2019s \u201cpretty trad\u201d for all artists who do that style to do it. I demanded a partial refund and they refused, so I complained to the owner who made the artist give me a full refund. \n\nNow the artist is running a full smear campaign, talking about moving shops, and all kinds of crap. My sister says I\u2019m an asshole for pushing the issue, but I feel like, at the end of the day, I told you exactly what I wanted and you didn\u2019t do that. AITA?",

Even she said she only knew because she\u2019s seen the tattoo so many times over the years, it stuck out. So it\u2019s not necessarily noticeable, and I COULD have just dropped it.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is great grandpa op's design, or his tattoo artist's. It was not designed to have the initials there, the artist had to modify the design to do so. And it's not like the artist could say it was to protect their design from being copied or something, since it's literally someone else's design! And honestly, fuck the tradition excuse. It was also traditional at one point to beat kids who were left handed. Tradition doesn't make it right!\n\nEdit: also, as has been pointed out, ITS NOT EVEN A TRADITION! Even if it was, it would still be shitty, but she doesn't even have the \"I'm just doing what I was trained to do\" excuse to fall back on",

The judges ripped him up for it. Same basic principle. Tattoo artists shouldn't be signing a tat in anyway without first discussing it with the client. Your artist definitely shouldn't have done this since it was a particularly meaningful design for you.",

But, the artist, my family and everyone who knew her and I agreed it was my grandmother was trying to tell me not to fuck with her writing from beyond, haha. \n\nSo glad that you had a similar experience with such a meaningful tattoo!",

That tattooist you used was on an ego trip, and you did not consent to being branded by her. The fact she did not inform you that she \u201csigns\u201d her work goes to show she knew it was wrong. Tattoos are permanent and expensive- you should have gotten exactly what you agreed to. Not sure about your tattoo shop, but each of mine had me sign an agreement that I wasn\u2019t under the influence of drugs or alcohol, wasn\u2019t under duress to have the tattoo, and that I agree to the image and placement of the tattoo. The owner of the shop did right by you by ensuring she refunded you. \n\nIf she keeps up with her tirade, and brings you into it by name, then you should call her out on her BS. It\u2019s likely she had a bunch of other clients who weren\u2019t aware they\u2019re carrying her initials (think back, neck, legs, and other areas the client may not be able to see clear details), and may not be happy about it. \n\nYour sister is wrong, and it\u2019s not her body, therefore she has no say. I hope there\u2019s a way to cover up the initials, maybe have the area (painfully) lasered off and eventually redone.\n\nI am so sorry you went through this. \n\nIn case you need further validation, surgeons have been caught \u201cbranding\u201d their initials on their patients\u2019 organs (think cardiac surgery, transplants, liver procedures) by other surgeons who performed surgeries later on those patients, which led to those previous surgeons being suspended, even losing their licenses.",

The thing I want to also state - it's not like it's effective marketing either. Everyone will have to ask who AJ/T is. If you were happy with it, you clearly have to tell them the tattoo artist so there's no need to brand you. They're stupid and they should learn their lesson or pack up and find a new career.",

A skilled copier, sure, but not the original artist\n2. Even then, that kind of marking should be approved by the client. They were being paid to create something you wanted, not their own work. \n3. Essentially that \"artist\" branded you with their initials\n4. Anyone who uses the term \"pretty trad\" should be punished imo",

Please understand,my English is my 3rd language. \n\nJust a little back story before we head to my issue here. My husband and i. Got into an accident 2 years ago, motorcycle accident. Traumatized me a lot. I had bruises, and a wounds a little head trauma but not that worse, he got a huge cut on his foot, about 13-15 stitches and bruises. And since then I'm very cautious when he's driving.\n\nSo my husband and I went to a trip. We brought our motorcycle to an island in the Philippines just so we can have easy ride anywhere we want. Since we are not familiar to any place in the island, were using maps. Also we both love to travel. He likes to do it riding the motorcycle, i prefer bus now lol but I'm trying to get over the trauma ive been through.\n\n\nHe's in the armed forces so most of the time check his phone. He has a habit of checking his phone while driving which annoys me everytime since I want us to be safe arriving to the location especially after what happened.\n\nSo last night i told him to focus since he's checking his phone in the holder and driving at the same time using maps.but he's just not that focus that we almost have it again. I told him, once, twice, third time i raised my voice just so i can get his attention to focus driving.\n\n\nAnd then, he yelled. \"WHAT!?\" He's not wearing a helmet or headset for him not to hear me. It put me in shock as i didnt want anyone to raise their voice at me. I hate it. I just said \"excuse me?\" And stayed quiet all the way to our hotel room. didn't say word. I don't know. I'm mad, sad, frustrated... \n\nHe was trying his classic making jokes in songs, changing lyrics, he does it to make laugh but i cant. I can't. I'm frustrated i cant speak.\n\nI laid down and was waiting for him to apologize but he didn't. And now. He isn't talking to me. Ignored me and just sleep. No apologies for raising his voice or anything. When he knew HOW MUCH I HATE IT. But nothing. I even get ignored.\n\nThe word \"sorry\", to me can fix everything.\n\nWhat should I do? I'm getting really tired getting a treatment like this when we have something to fix. He's trying to ignore the issue and just wait for to blew up and then help fix the relationship. Its the roxic side of him, that I'm trying to understand. IDK, I'm tired.\n\n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

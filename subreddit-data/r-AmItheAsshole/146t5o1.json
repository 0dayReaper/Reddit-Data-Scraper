Please view our [voting guide here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what.2019s_with_these_acronyms.3F_what_do_they_mean.3F), and remember to use **only one** judgement in your comment.\n\nOP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:\n\n &gt; (1) I went out of my way to help my friend and his friend with their event and business, despite being out of my depth on one aspect (which they knew). I had to bail on the final part which was helping Friend A by taking photos despite being completely new and having to buy a camera (and he knew this).\n\n(2) I can see why Friend A would say I\u2019m an asshole, but after everything I had done for him and his friend, and everything he knows about my personality, I would have expected better. So I\u2019m very confused if I made a massive blunder and I should apologise again or not?\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Those girls who berated you over a picture are terrible. Your friends should be more grateful that you were willing to help and even bought a camera for them.",

Even though you have the knowledge and skill set to do it, it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s easy or that time just magically didn\u2019t get spent on it. I would totally repackage and sell - you should be compensated for your efforts. I would also be very cautious of these friends bc they sound like users. Keep an eye open - it may be time to reevaluate this friendship. But good luck in selling it! I hope this flips into something fruitful for you and maybe launches your career to another level :)",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy friend (A) and I wanted to start our own businesses. Friend A introduced me to Friend B, who runs events at a nightclub. I offered to make an app for Friend B for free to support him and expand our network. Additionally, I volunteered to help Friend A with photography, even though it was outside my comfort zone. I purchased a used DSLR camera for this purpose.\n\nThe app was a success, generating significant engagement on local social media, and Friend B was pleased. On the big night, I arrived punctually at Friend A's house, well-dressed and equipped with the new camera. However, Friend A was unprepared and couldn't find his SD card, which I eventually located for him. We took a taxi (which I paid for) to the nightclub and faced some difficulty at the door because Friend A didn't know the name of the event. Fortunately, I knew the name since I had created the app.\n\nInside the venue, there were only a few people. I began setting up my camera while Friend A socialized and enjoyed a beer. Unfortunately, my camera started malfunctioning, with settings being permanently turned off and pictures not saving every time. Feeling very anxious and out of my element, I asked Friend A, who claimed to be an expert, for assistance, he couldn't fix the camera.\n\nAt that moment, a group of beautiful women approached me, requesting their photo be taken. Wanting to demonstrate my helpfulness, I agreed. However, the camera kept turning off each time I pressed the shutter button. The women became frustrated, and despite my explanations, they berated me, causing me to feel worse about myself.\n\nI found a quiet spot to regroup and attempt to fix or reset the camera, but nothing worked. Overwhelmed by anxiety, my fight-or-flight response kicked in, and I desperately wanted to leave. I decided to call it quits early, explaining to Friend A that the situation was too much for me and I didn't want to ruin their reputation.\n\nFriend A immediately doubted my reasons and accused me of bailing on him. He even blocked the exit, preventing me from leaving. Eventually, I convinced him. The following morning, Friend B called to thank me for the successful app and expressed disappointment about the photography mishap, but understood my situation.\n\nFriend B later revealed that Friend A had gotten drunk and partied until 4 am. I had missed a call from Friend A at that time, they probably wanted to say negative stuff. Later, Friend A, still drunk, texted me, calling me an asshole.\n\nI am now confused. I had done numerous favors for Friend A, including creating a successful app for Friend B, purchasing a new camera, and attempting to fix it on the event night. I left early, sparing their reputation from the amateur photography blunder and ensuring only a few people witnessed my struggle. \n\nDespite this, Friend A labeled me the asshole in the whole situation.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

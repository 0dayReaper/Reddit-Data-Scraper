    "postText": "I (31) have a half brother (Max) who just turned 18. For various reasons, I\u2019m his legal guardian.\n\nHe recently developed some mental health issues that make it extremely important that he has a present guardian. Mostly because his mental age is not 18, but much younger\u2014again due to various reasons. He\u2019ll flip from his usual regular 18 year old self to a much younger version. Doctors and therapist say it\u2019s a normal response, and with further aid, should grow out of it.\n\nNow my sister wasn\u2019t very happy with my decision to take Max in. Unfortunately for her, it wasn\u2019t her choice to make. We don\u2019t live together so it\u2019s not like I was making my brother her problem. \n\nMax\u2019s friends came over to see him and Max has been better lately so I left the house to give them some privacy. \n\nI called my sister and we got dinner together. Before we paid the bill, I ordered a little extra for Max because I hadn\u2019t cooked dinner for him. I wasn\u2019t going to make my sister pay and clearly asked for the food to be on a separate bill. \n\nShe asked why and I told her it was for Max. She asked if that was necessary because \u201che\u2019s 18, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll survive one night without dinner and if he\u2019s that hungry he can make himself a damn sandwich.\u201d He can, but as his guardian, I\u2019m gonna make sure he\u2019s well fed. \n\nI thought that was it but when the waiter brought out Max\u2019s food, my sister asked him if he could take it back which was just awkward. But I cut in and said it was fine. When the waiter left, my sister started arguing with me again. Saying that my brother\u2019s fine if he can be alone with his friends and doesn\u2019t need me to baby him. I have explained my brother\u2019s issue to her a billion times. I wasn\u2019t going to explain it again.\n\nI got up to leave but my sister was all like \u201cjust so you know, when you get married, no man is going to let him leech off of y\u2019all like a parasite.\u201d \n\nI laughed at her and said \u201cyou\u2019re delusional.\u201d By this time, people on the tables beside us were staring. I was embarrassed so I left. She came out a couple minutes later yelling about me embarrassing her and said that after I left, the people on the other tables made fun of her. She won\u2019t say what they said though. \n\nBut I felt bad and said sorry and she just keeps sarcastically asking if she\u2019s delusional. I genuinely do feel bad about embarrassing her and insulting her and I get that my brother makes it hard for me to spend time with her. She also thinks I\u2019m throwing my life away for a \u201cstranger\u201d and was manipulated into caring for him so as my sister, I sort of understand why she\u2019s so resentful. AITA?",

            "comment": "INFO: How old is your sister?\n\nBecause you were 13 when Max was born, and I'm getting the vibe from this that you and she became afterthoughts to your parents when he was born, because his needs are so high-maintenance. That you and/or her were parentified into being the caretaker for Max because your parents checked out on being parents because it was all just too hard, and she resents the way her teen years were destroyed by that. Whatever the case, it's obvious that your parents checked out of doing their job and left it to you kids.\n\nAnd if that's the case, then I can understand her anger and resentment about Max. That she's frustrated to see you altering what your adult life should have been, because you've been forced to take on an obligation that your parents should instead be fulfilling.\n\nIt's great that you've chosen to care for your half-brother. But your sister is right: very few potential partners are going to be willing to commit to a life with you that involves being lifelong caretakers for a full-sized adult who frequently behaves like a temperamental child (not to mention the drain on finances, which would be a strain on a relationship). Your sister is not delusional about that.\n\nThe other thing you should consider is whether you are actually doing what's best for Max by keeping him with you. You're not a trained professional for the kind of care and training he will need to become a functional adult -- and while there are bad facilities for that kind of care, there are also very good facilities for that kind of care, and what might actually be in Max's best interest is to get him a placement in a good residence where the staff are caring and trained to help him become the best possible functional adult he can be. \n\nYou also need to consider whether him being able to function on his own as an adult will ever actually be possible, and if not, what would give Max the best quality of life in an environment where he is getting the therapy and assistance he needs in the company of people his own age.\n\nIt's great that you're doing this for Max. But make sure that it's actually the best choice for both of you, and you're not just making a martyr of yourself.",

We have the same mom and she was with us more than she was with him. Mom has since passed away, my dad lives in another country, and Max\u2019s dad is the issue here\u2026 of course I stepped up. There\u2019s no one else. \n\nAnd the potential partner thing is right\u2014good thing I don\u2019t care about having a life partner. I mean I\u2019ve had my fair share of boyfriends but if I cared this much I would\u2019ve been married by now. I have never once cared about potential partners so it was a bit surprising my sister even brought it up. Which is why I called her delusional. \n\nAlso, I appreciate the concern but there isn\u2019t anything to worry about. I had to learn, he wasn\u2019t just handed to me. One of the main things I was taught was that I have to put myself first. Sort of like that thing you see on planes about oxygen masks. And again, if he stays like this forever, then I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll take care of him for as long as he needs. But he is getting better, and the main reason for this is because he feels safe and loved. He goes to therapy, his friends care and visit often, and I\u2019m present. I know it\u2019s different for everyone, but I know what Max needs better than you do. If I was incapable, it would\u2019ve shown and he would\u2019ve been taken from me ages ago.",

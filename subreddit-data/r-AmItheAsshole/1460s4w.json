    "postText": "I (F23) am a grad student who shares my workspace with four of my friends (F25, F23, M24, and M25). We all get along pretty well, and overall the experience has been enjoyable.\n\nYesterday, only M24, M25, and I were sharing the space. M24, who is a Muslim, had to go clean himself up so that he could pray and left his stuff (including his prayer mat) with M25 and myself. I chatted with M25 as I finished my work for the day and was also preparing to leave.\n\nAs I was packing up, M25 was eating pork chops and jokingly asked me what would happen if he accidentally dropped his food on M24's prayer mat. I firmly told him not to do that, but he persisted, saying that M24 would never know.\n\nM25 started to hover his food over M24's stuff and pretended to drop it on his stuff a few times before he accidentally dropped a piece of the pork chop on M24's prayer mat.\n\nI told him to tell M24, but M25 instead tried to clean it with a napkin. M24 returned to the room to retrieve his prayer mat. Before he could touch it, I blurted out what had happened.\n\nM24 got angry and started arguing with M25 about him making his stuff unclean. M25 argued that it wasn't a big deal and could be cleaned.\n\nI kinda panicked and felt very awkward there, so I quickly packed up my stuff and left. I texted F25 what had happened, and she said that I probably should have tried to defuse the situation. I also kinda felt bad about that, as I triggered the confrontation. I haven't spoken to either M24 or M25 since. AITA?",

This makes no sense at all.\n\nYour colleague just happened to be eating pork chops at the time, and yet the Muslim man handed his prayer mat to another man who was in the process of eating a pork chop? This just sounds totally implausible.\n\nAnd then pork chop guy turns out to be a dick.\n\nI think NTA. Pork Chop guy is the AH.",

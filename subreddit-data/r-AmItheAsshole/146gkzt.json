You are sensible to choose a school based on its strength in what you hope is going to be your field. \n\nThe problem is that your mother is bringing up extraneous stuff. So, the costs are roughly equivalent, and what she\u2019s concerned about is security and being able to visit? She\u2019s going to get emotional. You need a rational plan A and a plan B when she tries to play the money card. \n\nHow are your grades? Get them as high as you can. Apply for every scholarship you can. You CAN talk directly to financial aid yourself, and it\u2019s worth doing. Ideally, you need to assemble as close to a full ride as you can. \n\nI am American and talking as I would to a US student. It\u2019s advice I used for myself snd seen used for others. See if any of it translates to meet your needs.\n\nBeware: if she singsongs and draws out her bowels snd emphasizes words like Neeeed snd shaaaaare and caaaaare and starts talking about selfishness, you\u2019re facing war by sentimentality. It cost me a BPhil at Oxford.  Don\u2019t let it cost you.",

If she\u2019s paying for it she has the say in what and where she pays. Doesn\u2019t make it right but you don\u2019t have access to her funds so if this is your dilemma my advice is rethink your approach and find a better way to sell it than arguing with her. It\u2019s not about what you want in that case but how it would benefit her and make her happy which my be a difficult sell if she wants to keep an eye on you.",

            "comment": "NTA  \n\n\nThis is complex because she might not have a rational take on her way of thinking, and she might be emotional and selfish. If the only one she has is you, she might very much be overly attached. My guess is that she is an overprotective mom and she doesn't want to lose you or see you hurt, so she wants to keep protecting you, or have you closer to fill her needs of company and closeness.  \n\n\nIf the University you desire truly costs the same, even with transport, rent, food and other stuff you might need to pay; and if the university truly is better for what you want to study, then you need to sell it better. To convince her, make her feel safe about your decision and make her thing it is truly the best for you and your future. Go with her to visit the university, ask professors, other students, workers or directives how the university works, which are its perks, the advantages of you studying there. Ask for scholarships.  \n\n\nAnd make a plan on how to live near the university or commute from home to your university, be sure and decisive on what you want and make her feel you are sure of it, that you have clear plans. This will make you more convincing and her more supportive, if she is a person that can be reasoned with and if she truly wants the best for you.",

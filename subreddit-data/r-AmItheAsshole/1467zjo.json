You can legally park there, and presumably they know it's your car so it's passive aggressive of them to leave a note rather than actually speaking to you. \nHowever, it is courteous to park outside of your own house when you can. Go and speak to your neighbour about it, this can easily blow up into a bigger problem if you don't deal with it like adults.",

And one of life's unwritten rules was, if possible, do not park directly in front of someone else's house, chances are thats where they like to park, for what I would have thought were obvious reasons. These days  courtesy and respect for others is unknown to most people.   \nIt drives me crazy to come home and find someone parked right in front of my gate, even when the rest of the road is clear.

    "postText": "There's a couple that has lived next door to my mother for decades. I own the property for tax reasons. The husband, \"Jay\" was best friends with my dad until my dad died 20 years ago. Even after trying a lot, I just can't get this man's respect.  \n\nI've shoveled snow from their corner walk, I've mowed their corner lot, and I've done many other things, trying to be a good neighbor.\n\nI've always trimmed this hedgerow in my mom's yard. I'm older now and it became a pain. One day I'm getting out of my car, Jay comes up to me and says, \"Why don't you stop being a fcking asshole and go trim your shrubs?\" I don't have a lot of time some days. They're on his property too, but I trimmed both sides anyway.  \n\nI had the shrubs taken out and the ground was leveled, $650. There is one part of the land that has pieces of concrete in it and needs to be removed before I could put a fence in. Summer passes, still no matching fence panels. Jay approaches me last weekend, telling me that he's tired of waiting on me and he'll put up a fence. It's not going to match the other side.\n\nI said that I was planning on taking out the concrete anyway, so I'll still pay for it. Earlier, I got an estimate for $350, but it couldn't be done until fall. Monday, Jay comes up to me, telling me that he wants the fence up by Friday! I tell him that's unrealistic. He says that he has someone to put up his fence and remove the concrete. I call the guy and he comes out on Tuesday \"to make sure we're all on the same page\". He comes out and tells me what the neighbor told him to do. He wants $950! I told the contractor that I need to talk to Jay. Later, I ask Jay to go outside to talk about this. He confirmed what the contractor said and insinuated that I'm paying for it all. I tell him, \"Look, I'll split the cost with you if you MUST have the fence like this.\" He starts F bombing me about how it's my property, my responsibility. I say, \"Well, I'm not paying the whole $950. If you don't want to split it, then I guess you're shit out of luck.\" I went inside. Later, he says, \"I'm going to build the fence from the driveway.\" So, he's going to ignore the land that needed the work and build the fence like it should have been in the first place. I say ok, figuring this is over.  \n\nThe next day, I get a VM from the contractor. He said, \"Your neighbor called me and he wants the work done. I'll meet you at your property and you can pay me for your half of the work.\" I was livid. I said, \"Look, I'm not giving you any money until I hear it from my neighbor's mouth that he wants this work done. He F bombed me about it, not wanting to split the cost.\" I apologized to the contractor for being so curt and he said that he would call the neighbor back and let him know. No call from Jay yet. I was pissed that Jay got the contractor to do his own dirty work. I knew he wouldn't have the balls to apologize to me, nor tell me that he's changed his mind about the work. AFAIC, I'm done with him.\n\nAITA?  \n\nUpdate: I'd like to thank the several people that gave me their opinion and/or ideas of how to handle my neighbor.  I'm glad that this didn't turn into a large thing, quality over quantity.  Have a great weekend!",

He refused to pay anything, so I went to my lawyer.  He said that I had to put in a claim with my home insurance company.  I couldn't understand it, but this is the way the law is in my state anyway... If a tree is on someone else's property and a branch from said tree, damaged anything on my property, it's not the tree owner's liability.  I think that's insane that my rates should have to go up because someone doesn't want to take care of their tree.",

The other trunk is massive and if the wind is blowing right, I'm sure it could take out the roof of the house.  I've had a tree guy come out and estimate how much it would be to take it down and it was something like $5K.  That was a few years ago.  I can't afford that.  I was trying to get a couple of the neighbors and the owner to chip in, but of course, no one is interested.  I just pray hard and hope when the trunk comes down, it won't be on my house.  \n\nEdit: Why September?",

Usually, it would fall to the landlord, and you ARE a landlord, whether or not he pays you rent, to cover general maintenence and upkeep of the home, in this case, unless an agreement had previously been met previously. You seem like you're unwilling to have the patience to figure out said agreement, OP, yet are shocked when he is still billing you for upkeep on YOUR property. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Also why is the contractor approving work for a client who is NOT the homeowner's express approval, which he very clearly did NOT have? I would imagine that would be worth looking into from a legal standpoint. \n\nThere are buts I really feel like are being omitted here that would he beneficial, like who normally would pay for general upkeep and maintenence around the lot in your agreement (as I imagine you have one for him to continue to reside on a property owned by you), but it really isn't needed as I have enough to say E S H. Jay for...everything, you for your general response regarding this fence and a general unwillingness to coordinate calmly and coolly and then expecting respect when frankly all I see here is genuine disrespect for your tenant, and the contractor for illegally attempting to do work on your property without your consent.\n\nEDIT: I left my original verdict up there, editing it accordingly so it did not count, so people can transparently see what I initially, and incorrectly, thought. But OP's reply cleared up a few things I misunderstood, and as such, am going to change my actual verdict to echo the masses: **NTA.** Sorry OP, that was on me!",

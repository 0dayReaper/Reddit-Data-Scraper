To everyone saying that she could have taken the card without permission, you are right. But it is still none of OP\u2019s business and there is no way to know for sure. \n\nIf the girl was an adult who said she was using her husband\u2019s card, OP likely wouldn\u2019t have batted an eye.",

Plenty of people use 'spoiled' to mean that a kid is pampered and/or has plenty of money, but I would argue that this isn't fair since 'spoiled' sounds pejorative.\n\nI see spoiled as a kid who is selfish and/or greedy due to pampering. I think it is perfectly possible to have plenty of money and allow your kids to benefit from it but also set reasonable boundaries and discipline them appropriately and end up with them living a happy, comfortable life, but without it being an inevitability that they are spoiled and greedy.",

It wasn't even a damn VISA or anything, a \"loomingdales\" card. I can't tell you how many times my parents did the same- I had permission to buy what I wanted or needed and to use their card. Some people don't have the same price constraints as you and a pair of shoes over $1k isn't a big deal. AND EVEN THEN, it's her dad's card, he would have seen the statement and known exactly what she purchased that was that expensive. The fact that this teen was able to pull out \"her own\" credit card and put it on there instead of walking away from the purchase shows that this girl is living in a very different world than you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course she walked away crying; you were mean, belittling, sticking your nose where it didn't belong, and causing a scene over a common occurrence. Adult and teenage me would have given you a big middle finger and then swiped my mom's card (that I'm a goddamn authorized user on).",

Children in particular use their parents cards all the time and it's usually approved and on the up and up. Sometimes its spoiled kid, like the girl in the post. You would be amazed how many children and teens I've seen deliberately released into a store to pick and buy whatever they want, despite having no respect for the value of the money they are spending. \n\nIts obnoxious, but definately not deserving of harrassment and public embarrassment by an absolute stranger. And besides that you have no idea her situation! \n\nI actually had something similar happen to me as a preteen, except I was getting groceries for my mom who was ill and stayed in the car, sending me in with her card and a list. The snoop thought I was too young to have a credit card so it must not be mine. Luckily I could go out to the parking lot and get my mom to come in. I was embarrassed to high hell and hated doing such favors for my parents from then on, until they got me a card in my name.\n\nAnd finally, it's not actually illegal. So congrats, you were and asshole and have literally zero excuse.\n\nQuote from credit.com\n\"...It's not\u00a0illegal\u00a0to lend someone else your credit card... that little loan is not breaking any federal or state laws.

It's clear you were jealous that a young girl had the means (yes, even if they are her FAMILY'S means) to make a large purchase that you couldn't. Sit down and mind your own business. You just ruined several people's days over your own pointless self righteousness. At least the department store employees will have a great laugh about the crazy lady in line today. I hope you don't shop there often, retail workers don't forget.",

I take it you dont have children or experience with children.\n\nTeens do go to the mall with their parents cards. Its apart of growing up, we trust them to go out with friends, yes they are going to be teens (tell me you were a perfect angel at that age..yeah right) they shop, hang out and then come home. They are to young to have cards in their name (also it is illegal) so of course parents give them thier card\n\nI have three teenagers, we have prepaid cards that have the adults names on it and when they want to go to the mall with their friends they have that amount to spend. They earned it. \n\nYour wife was and is right your just a nosey asshole. Get a life.",

She used it a lot to buy us food, some parents can afford it and are willing to let their kids spend.",

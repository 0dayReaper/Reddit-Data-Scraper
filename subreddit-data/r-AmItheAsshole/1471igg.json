    "postText": "He technically didn\u2019t cause an allergic reaction but he pushed me into it. I (26f) am allergic to a plant that lives in the state my husband (29m) and I have moved to. We aren\u2019t sure which plant yet but are narrowing it down kinda. My doctor has told me not to do any yardwork whatsoever because I have an allergic reaction every time. Full body rash and swollen joints for like a week. Wearing gloves and protective clothes has not helped. \n\nMy husband knows all of this. Yesterday he mowed, and pressured me into helping him rake up grass and weeds. I didn\u2019t want to and I mentioned that I could have an allergic reaction but he said that he needed help and that I would be fine. Against my better judgement I thought that if I just raked and didn\u2019t physically touch anything I would be fine. I didn\u2019t want to refuse him when he insisted. \n\nToday I have a rash all over and a lot of swelling and I feel like shit. I normally meal prep for the next week on Sundays. This morning I half assed threw me some salads in Tupperware for next week and called it a day. I eat a lot of easy stuff that doesn\u2019t require cooking so it\u2019s fine. My husband on the other hand eats like 15 pounds of meat a week as well as vegetables and sides. It usually takes me hours to cook his food and it\u2019s very draining. \n\nI told him he needs to cook his food for the next week, because I\u2019m too tired and my skin feels awful. He got mad and said he\u2019d just eat takeout since he wants to relax on his last day off. So now I have to freeze all the meat so it doesn\u2019t go to waste. He only cooks once or twice a year. \n\nHe thinks it\u2019s not fair for me to not feed him since I agreed to rake and it isn\u2019t his fault I had an allergic reaction. Im not trying to punish him but I\u2019m really suffering right now and I just don\u2019t have it in me. I also do think it wasn\u2019t fair for him to pressure me into doing something he knows I medically shouldn\u2019t do. \n\nAITA for not feeding my husband?\n\nEdit: dang you guys really hate my husband haha. He\u2019s actually a pretty decent guy, I think this post just portrayed him in a bad light. He works 80 hours a week to support me while I go to school, and he still manages to do at least half of the cleaning. I talked to him and he said his back was just hurting and he was stressed out from work and he wasn\u2019t thinking. He apologized and brought me dinner while I layed on the couch. I\u2019m not doing his meal prep this week because I really just can\u2019t but we both came to terms with it. He\u2019ll feed his self and I\u2019ll try to manage my skin as best as I can. It looks awful and feels worse. He\u2019s not a lazy guy, he works hard to make things up in other areas, he just hates cooking. Which, to be fair, I hated yardwork even before we moved to this shitty state where I\u2019m allergic to everything.",

He should not have bullied you into helping with the raking.  You have the horrible consequences of helping, and he is now experiencing the inconvenient easy consequence of not having you prep his meals for the week.   I am so angry that he expects you to cook when you don't feel well.  He is choosing not to cook.  Please do not feel guilty that you are not up to feeding him.  He is a grown man.  I hope you can treat yourself to something nice when this latest allergy attack is over.  Please don't help next time.  You may have an allergy attack that is even worse next time.",

(Saw one in 2021, but didn't want to drive a 2 hour round trip once a week for years.) Thankfully, there is now an allergist's office in my town. (My ENT only runs tests for certain allergens, and I need a full panel since my allergies can really bad. Who knows what other autoimmune issue I may have as well at this point.)",

The throat swelling and itchiness started to show, but she was also in immense pain and felt like her stomach was going to explode. The EMTs ignored it and didn't relay it to the triage staff (telling her to \"just rest and let us do the talking\" when she tried to speak up). Finally, when she got to the resident who was on call, he explained that it was an anaphylactic response in her digestive tract. Basically the walls of her small intestine were swelling the way the tissues around the throat would, and the walls pressing on each other is what was causing that intolerable pain. The resident was extremely aware and diligent, thank goodness, because even the attending wasn't aware that type of allergic response was possible! Not very impressive for Puke (ahem) University Hospital. But ever since then, we've made sure any time a discussion of dangerous allergic reactions comes up, we share this anecdote to raise awareness just in case (hopefully never) someone finds themselves in such a situation.",

I\u2019m not even calling HIM an asshole (YET), but I\u2019m definitely leaning towards it because my best guess here is:  that he either thinks you\u2019re making an excuse not to help out or doesn\u2019t understand/believe your symptoms.   \n\nAnd I\u2019ll go one step further and toss in the stereotype that when you are actually sick, you likely \u201cpower through\u201d it because you feel like you HAVE TO and that is probably taken for granted.   \n\n(Simultaneously having COVID was an eye opener for me:  my husband still maintains that his was \u201cworse\u201d because his fever was higher and I tended to him in bed *even after I caught it from him.* While I maintain that I didn\u2019t need someone to remind me or deliver medicine 15 minutes early for a week and a half, I managed for myself, him, and the household.).  He\u2019s still pretty great overall but adorably childlike when sick whereas I am NOT.  I keep moving, I HAVE TO.  \n\n\nNTA.  And please tap out for a couple of sick days.  Enjoy the rest.",

Why does he feel entitled to your help, but still thinks it\u2019s ok not to offer you any help knowing how sick you are?  He\u2019s a selfish child.",

I (26f) am allergic to a plant that lives in the state my husband (29m) and I have moved to. We aren\u2019t sure which plant yet but are narrowing it down kinda. My doctor has told me not to do any yardwork whatsoever because I have an allergic reaction every time. Full body rash and swollen joints for like a week. Wearing gloves and protective clothes has not helped. \n\nMy husband knows all of this. Yesterday he mowed, and pressured me into helping him rake up grass and weeds. I didn\u2019t want to and I mentioned that I could have an allergic reaction but he said that he needed help and that I would be fine. Against my better judgement I thought that if I just raked and didn\u2019t physically touch anything I would be fine. I didn\u2019t want to refuse him when he insisted. \n\nToday I have a rash all over and a lot of swelling and I feel like shit. I normally meal prep for the next week on Sundays. This morning I half assed threw me some salads in Tupperware for next week and called it a day. I eat a lot of easy stuff that doesn\u2019t require cooking so it\u2019s fine. My husband on the other hand eats like 15 pounds of meat a week as well as vegetables and sides. It usually takes me hours to cook his food and it\u2019s very draining. \n\nI told him he needs to cook his food for the next week, because I\u2019m too tired and my skin feels awful. He got mad and said he\u2019d just eat takeout since he wants to relax on his last day off. So now I have to freeze all the meat so it doesn\u2019t go to waste. He only cooks once or twice a year. \n\nHe thinks it\u2019s not fair for me to not feed him since I agreed to rake and it isn\u2019t his fault I had an allergic reaction. Im not trying to punish him but I\u2019m really suffering right now and I just don\u2019t have it in me. I also do think it wasn\u2019t fair for him to pressure me into doing something he knows I medically shouldn\u2019t do. \n\nAITA for not feeding my husband?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

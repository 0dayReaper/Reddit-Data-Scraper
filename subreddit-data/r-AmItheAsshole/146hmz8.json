    "postText": "My girlfriend has this really annoying habit of speaking on my behalf. She assumes how I'm feeling, and then says that to people, that \"Secure\\_Stress\\_8395 feels this way\" or \"Secure\\_Stress\\_8395 believes xyz\". Usually I would confront her in private and tell her that this isn't ok, but she still keeps doing, I guess she thinks she knows me really well or something, but it's annoying as hell because of how I get misrepresented.\n\nAnyways, last weekend we watched this movie with our friends at a friend's house. I was really involved with the movie and loving the story beats and the cinematography, while I literally saw my girlfriend talking during the movie, and even checking her phone, but I didn't say anything cuz its not my buisness.\n\nAnyways, the ending was really sad, and a couple of people started crying during the ending, my girlfriend included. Once the movie was over, everyone was talking about how sad the ending was, but I didn't really join in since I was still thinking about the movie because it really affected me.\n\nSome of my friends were kinda confused why I wasn't saying anything, and I was about to explain why, but my girlfriend says, \"Oh Secure\\_Stress\\_8395 doesn't really get these kinds of movies, I guess he's not very emotionally sensitive\". Normally this wouldn't bother me so much, but I have this reputation of being unemotional and hard hearted that's not really true, and that I'm trying to lose, so I got really pissed and called my girlfriend a liar.\n\nIn the ride back, she got really mad at me for making a scene, and then I got mad and said that this wouldn't have happened if you didn't try and speak on my behalf, and now we're not speaking to one another.",

My mother routinely tells me things about myself like \u201cI don\u2019t follow the news\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t like eggs\u201d and even directly contradicting her doesn\u2019t make a dent. She also argues with my medical diagnoses and other assorted confirmed facts. It\u2019s entirely infuriating, but there\u2019s no amount of proof or arguing that will ever change it.\n\nAs a woman, I\u2019ve also had plenty of men tell me what I think and feel, and who were not willing or able to accept my assertion as the correct one. It\u2019s pretty fuckin\u2019 ridiculous. Again, pretty common, not up to the order of NPD but still infuriating.\n\nOP can at least dump this woman. Sounds like he doesn\u2019t even need to be there anyway! She can just create a whole narrative about \u201ccharacter based on OP\u201d and there will literally be no difference!",

Frankly after knowing you dislike it she should have stopped, and to continue misrepresenting you is effectively trying to apply your assumed position to her benefit. In other words, she's using your made up stance for clout or ridicule.\n\nIn the scenario given she more or less insulted you by implying you were too emotionally insensitive to get an emotional film, which is not just insulting it's outright foolish. There is a difference between not being incredibly expressive and not having the emotional range to feel for the plight of people in fiction. You're clearly the former, and trying to make the move to be more expressive, but you clearly have a completely normal and full range of emotional development.\n\nYour girlfriend is an asshole for talking out of her ass.\n\nNTA",

She assumes how I'm feeling, and then says that to people, that \"Secure\\_Stress\\_8395 feels this way\" or \"Secure\\_Stress\\_8395 believes xyz\". Usually I would confront her in private and tell her that this isn't ok, but she still keeps doing, I guess she thinks she knows me really well or something, but it's annoying as hell because of how I get misrepresented. \n\nAnyways, last weekend we watched this movie with our friends at our house. I was really involved with the movie and loving the story beats and the cinematography, while I literally saw my girlfriend talking during the movie, and even checking her phone, but I didn't say anything cuz its not my buisness. \n\nAnyways, the ending was really sad, and a couple of people started crying during the ending, my girlfriend included. Once the movie was over, everyone was talking about how sad the ending was, but I didn't really join in since I was still thinking about the movie because it really affected me.\n\nSome of my friends were kinda confused why I wasn't saying anything, and I was about to explain why, but my girlfriend says, \"Oh Secure\\_Stress\\_8395 doesn't really get these kinds of movies, I guess he's not very emotionally sensitive\". Normally this wouldn't bother me so much, but I have this reputation of being unemotional and hard hearted that's not really true, and that I'm trying to lose, so I got really pissed and called my girlfriend a liar.\n\nIn the ride back, she got really mad at me for making a scene, and then I got mad and said that this wouldn't have happened if you didn't try and speak on my behalf, and now we're not speaking to one another.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you stay with her, you\u2019ll end up with a social media account with both of your names as the label, you\u2019ll be referred to as \u201cwe\u201d, as in \u201c*we* don\u2019t think that -\u201c and if you go on to have kids they\u2019ll have 100% no privacy or autonomy. This is where it starts, the red flags may be small but they are there. She\u2019ll be bossing you around and telling you how to think, dress and behave because she \u201cknows best\u201d. If she hasn\u2019t already told you she knows you better than you know yourself, it\u2019s only a matter of time. \n\nI also don\u2019t like how she puts you down so effortlessly with saying she \u201cguesses you\u2019re not very emotionally sensitive\u2026.\u201d How would she know? She is so used to hearing her own opinions I guarantee you she doesn\u2019t hear you when you speak to her.",

    "postText": "I (21) have worked for a private organization since I graduated from my diploma program. They promised full time hours but never did and honestly were up to a lot of unethical stuff. I\u2019m a \u201ccontractor\u2019 of sorts for them so my pay is not on a monthly billing schedule. I\u2019m no longer with this organization, but they refuse to pay me over $1500. \nI have been applying and looking for new jobs. I have a bunch of education that should help me get a job but so far nothing firm. I did an exam and passed for one and I\u2019m just waiting for a crim check for another. \n\nUnfortunately we are struggling and my boyfriend had to cover the majority of rent last month and I currently have $4 in my bank account. He (23) was talking sadistically about getting a second job and I expressed how it may be a good idea for now. At this point we don\u2019t have enough for rent, bills, or food. \n\nI am trying to get a job and feel that the one I had two interviews with will come through quickly (it\u2019s my emergency for now job, that\u2019s within my field) until the exam one that pays significantly more contacts me. I also want to add that when I have full employment and better pay we agreed that he will transition to part time work and start his degree. \n\nAm I the asshole for encouraging him to get a second job while I\u2019m not even working? Or is this just a weird complicated mess and that\u2019s where my shame and anxiety is coming from?\n\nEdit: he is a by trade butcher with 4 years of cutting experience \nI am in health care and have been applying to every job on indeed in my area, even out of my field and in the service industry",

Now at these interviews they don't tell you that they exp3ct you to stick around for an additional hour(ish) to see how you fit within the team. So my last interview (i knew i hadn't got it) i was asked if i had my own car/licence - i did not... I was relying on my FIL to give me a lift (in rural areas busses are abit of a myth). Initially that wasn't as big of an issue until they asked if i had about an extra hour to spare... To which I said I didn't (FIL had his own job we only accounted for the time of an interview and travel time wasn't told of any other details bar the interview lasting about an hour).\n\nAs soon as I said i couldn't I was shown out the door \ud83d\ude02. The guy ran a good half an hour behind with his staff PDR prior and someone came over to ask him about taking some PTO while we were mid-interview since he did it in the main restaraunt bit.\n\nThat one closed for almost a year as well after that",

Sometimes they see that their legal defense fees are more than what they owe you.  Actually, you should probably tell them that they're either going to pay you the money they owe, or they're going to have to pay an attorney, which probably will cost them twice as much, and even still they will likely have to pay you on top of the attorney fees.",

They promised full time hours but never did and honestly were up to a lot of unethical stuff. I\u2019m a \u201ccontractor\u2019 of sorts for them so my pay is not on a monthly billing schedule. I\u2019m no longer with this organization, but they refuse to pay me over $1500. \nI have been applying and looking for new jobs. I have a bunch of education that should help me get a job but so far nothing firm. I did an exam and passed for one and I\u2019m just waiting for a crim check for another. \n\nUnfortunately we are struggling and my boyfriend had to cover the majority of rent last month and I currently have $4 in my bank account. He (23) was talking sadistically about getting a second job and I expressed how it may be a good idea for now. At this point we don\u2019t have enough for rent, bills, or food. \n\nI am trying to get a job and feel that the one I had two interviews with will come through quickly (it\u2019s my emergency for now job, that\u2019s within my field) until the exam one that pays significantly more contacts me. I also want to add that when I have full employment and better pay we agreed that he will transition to part time work and start his degree. \n\nAm I the asshole for encouraging him to get a second job while I\u2019m not even working? Or is this just a weird complicated mess and that\u2019s where my shame and anxiety is coming from?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I will say though, it might not be the worst idea to at least start looking into service industry jobs in case you don't get the \"emergency\" job to at least have something.",

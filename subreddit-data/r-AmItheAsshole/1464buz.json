It's probably not something I should even worry about and it's not like it's my birthday, it's his day and up to him who he spends his time with. But why am I feeling sort of left out :(\n\nI'm not sure if I should ask why I wasn't invited or why he didn't continue the plans we had (the party)",

There\u2019s a difference between a \u201choneymoon\u201d phase and completely ignoring someone when a romantic partner is added to the mix. Maybe it\u2019s because his girlfriends aren\u2019t comfortable with him having a female bff, but it still doesn\u2019t mean he should completely ignore you. I get backing off a bit, but his quick response to shut you out is strange. \n\nHave you considered that perhaps he has feelings for you that you don\u2019t know about and being rude toward you when he gets a gf is his response? I\u2019m not condoning his behavior, not at all, but I feel like there\u2019s more to it than what he lets you see. As others said, I think you should try to have a talk. Clear the air and let him know how you feel about his treatment of you.",

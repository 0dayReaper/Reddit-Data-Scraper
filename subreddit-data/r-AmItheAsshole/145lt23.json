    "postText": "Sorry for the long post!\n\nI(34F)and my father(54)haven\u2019t had the best relationship in a few years, my mom died when I was young and my dad took it hard, which led a strain in our relationship.\n\nDespite that, we have maintained a friendly and good relationship, to the point he mentioned to me he was looking for someone to date a few years ago. I was a bit surprised due to how depressed he seemed after my mom\u2019s death, but I supported him.\n\nAnd so two years ago, he introduced me to his now fianc\u00e9, someone I\u2019ll call Luke for this. Luke is nice, he\u2019s friendly and helps me out a lot, unfortunately Luke is 35 years old, only a year older than me. I was uncomfortable seeing a man my age and my father dating but I never brought it up since they were fairly private with it.\n\nThe big problem arrived just a week ago, we were having family dinner, I had prepared everything, including our traditional food that took me days to actually finish, I served my father and Luke and my girlfriend before sitting down. \n\nThat\u2019s when my father announced he and his partner were engaged, I wasn\u2019t that happy, since I never agreed or approved of their relationship, not that I said so, so maybe that\u2019s my mistake. \n\nI asked if I could talk to my dad and we went into my room. I told him it was wildly inappropriate to have a relationship with someone the same age as his daughter, he pointed out how Luke was older but I simply told him how grossed out I feel seeing them have to kiss and now I have to see them get married.\n\nWe argued, he said some hurtful things that made me cry and then I also brought up hurtful things that made him storm out.\n\nLuke left after him after he apologized to me and my girlfriend while thanking us for the meal, which made me feel guilty. \n\nI told my girlfriend what had happened and she says we should talk it out and maybe I was being too rude, I disagreed but now it\u2019s been a week and my dad has been a bit cold with me.\n\nWas I in the wrong? AITA?\n\nEdit 3: this will be the last, I apologize but no update will be added. I believe the comments have gotten too uncivil for my tastes and I do not wish to feel worst as I\u2019ve already been feeling.\n\nI will talk to my father and apologize and after their wedding I will cut contact with both him and Luke, who is lovely by the way. \n\nThank you all for your feedback, I will attempt to mature and be less childish, as I\u2019ve already admitted to. I am sorry for bothering you all with this post and my replies, I didn\u2019t wish to come off as rude or immature, I sincerely apologize and appreciate everyone\u2019s feedback.\n\nI won\u2019t delete this account until I decide if I will write an update or not but I am leaning on no.\n\nSorry for the dreadfully long post, bye!",

Yes, but I think the comments are digging into her way too much. She\u2019s possibly traumatized and has complicated feelings regarding her father. Implying she is jealous or being insecure is blatantly false since this is clearly a more serious issue than a kid throwing a tantrum(and someone implying she might be homophobic??).\n\nTo OP.\nYTA for this *sole* interaction, but your father is the worst for laying his hands on you and being a horrible partner/boyfriend to your mother.\n\nEDIT: also, many people brushed off how OP\u2019s father made her cry, which could be unimportant, but judging from his stated previous actions and behaviors, this man still sucks to this day.",

            "comment": "Ok this is long but I personally think NTA based off the post AND the responses OP has given. Luke is a consenting adult and it isnt OPs right to approve their relationship. That being said, based off how OPs father cheated multiple times on OPs mom and how he has a history of being violently physical, as well as being desaproving of OPs sexuality when she came out, then I understand why OP would react negatively towards her father making such a comitment as marriage and with someone of the same sex. I personally would have limited contact just to make sure Luke is alright even after marriage just based of the fathers history. Again this is based off the info I have found on responses and the post. It's possible OPs father might have been copying what he saw growing up and he might have started changing after OP came out or Luke came around. Either way OP has not gotten to truly talk about how she felt when her father came out to her after having reacted so badly to her coming out and then having to adjust to seeing her father in such a committed  relationship than what she was used to. I do think OP should have a sit down with her father as well as a mediator like, their partners, and have OP tell her father how she felt throughout the past couple of years or how she feels about the current situation. Sorry for the long post and I'm sorry to OP for the people who have reacted really negatively in the comments, you're entitled to your emotions especially with the history you have with your father and I'm sorry if the comments made you're feelings seem less. Also I understand some comments might have not seen OPs responses which would make the story seem different. Again I don't think YTA for feeling the way you do which to me, justify your actions, that being said without the context of your history I do think you're at the very least, in the wrong.",

Said daughter has been only queer and from OPs replies, her father hurt her physically when she came out. So, of course she would hold resentment over it, especially if he suddenly comes out as queer as well despite showing he was(or is)bigoted.\n\nThen, we have the fact that this man was never married to OPs mother, who he was depressed about, but apparently cheated on repeatedly with younger women(this man already has a pattern of young partners). So, her father having a young partner, would of course disgust her and being back memories of his cheating days. And suddenly he\u2019s ready to settle down with this guy too? I bet Luke is lovely, but I do not blame OP.\n\n And then, we have the fact OP went no contact with her father for a time before reconnecting, so no matter how long it\u2019s been, it will be hard to navigate their relationship, and then this man starts dating someone only a year(or even a few months)older than his own daughter and is engaged after a few years.\n\nThis man has shown himself to be disloyal, abusive and generally a big AH. \nOP is NTA, I genuinely don\u2019t care if she should just \u2018be happy for him\u2019, because she has a right to be traumatized and her trauma should be validated.\n\nA lot of people in the comment section is simply bashing her and not even taking in account her trauma and what she might be feeling, and we do not know what her father told OP to make her cry(interesting how it\u2019s only OP who was being \u2018mean\u2019). Some comments are also borderline victim blaming and kissing OPs dad\u2019s ass.\n\nThe dad is the asshole, OP deserves better and Luke, he sounds nice so far, should probably run.",

I was a bit surprised due to how depressed he seemed after my mom\u2019s death, but I supported him.\n\nAnd so two years ago, he introduced me to his now fianc\u00e9, someone I\u2019ll call Luke for this. Luke is nice, he\u2019s friendly and helps me out a lot, unfortunately Luke is 35 years old, only a year older than me. I was uncomfortable seeing a man my age and my father dating but I never brought it up since they were fairly private with it.\n\nThe big problem arrived just a week ago, we were having family dinner, I had prepared everything, including our traditional food that took me days to actually finish, I served my father and Luke and my girlfriend before sitting down. \n\nThat\u2019s when my father announced he and his partner were engaged, I wasn\u2019t that happy, since I never agreed or approved of their relationship, not that I said so, so maybe that\u2019s my mistake. \n\nI asked if I could talk to my dad and we went into my room. I told him it was wildly inappropriate to have a relationship with someone the same age as his daughter, he pointed out how Luke was older but I simply told him how grossed out I feel seeing them have to kiss and now I have to see them get married.\n\nWe argued, he said some hurtful things that made me cry and then I also brought up hurtful things that made him storm out.\n\nLuke left after him after he apologized to me and my girlfriend while thanking us for the meal, which made me feel guilty. \n\nI told my girlfriend what had happened and she says we should talk it out and maybe I was being too rude, I disagreed but now it\u2019s been a week and my dad has been a bit cold with me.\n\nWas I in the wrong? AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

It would be different if Luke were in his early 20s or in a position where OP\u2019s father was taking advantage of a power imbalance. \n\nBut, my question was other than marrying someone younger, what is the definition of a predator and what behavior I should be watching for in my perfectly healthy and mutually respectful marriage? Because just saying all people who marry someone younger is predatory is shortsighted and immature. And what is the cutoff? 10 years? 15? So, if you meet and fall in love with someone 16 years older than you (before knowing their age), you would just cut it off based on age alone? That seems sad. Life experience teaches you that things are rarely black and white, real life happens in the gray area in between and putting people in stereotype boxes you created in your mind based on a few bad examples will make you miss out on pretty great people and experiences.",

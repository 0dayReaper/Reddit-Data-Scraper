They did none of these things. It isn't your job to know they have an aggressive dog, it is their job to deal with it including being the ones to cross the street if necessary.\n\nIn the future if you have an aggressive dog approaching try to move away even though that should be their job not yours. You can also carry treats and drop them to distract the approaching dog. People might get pissed but if they let the dog close enough to eat treats you have dropped at your feet then that is on them.",

Today when I was walking him there was a couple walking their smaller dog heading towards me. With smaller dogs I will get Baxter to sit down so he doesn\u2019t immediately try and sniff the other dog. When the couple reached us they said their dog is known to bite. So I held Baxter in place so they could walk past us. Instead they let their dog come up Baxter and immediately bit him on the nose. Thankfully he isn\u2019t hurt just a small scratch. But the couple got mad at me saying I should have crossed the street. Honestly if you know your dog bites, shouldn\u2019t you be the one crossing the street? Let me know what I should have done so this doesn\u2019t happen in the future.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

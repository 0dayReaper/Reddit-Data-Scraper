    "postText": "Me and 2 other guys share an apartment together and we split all the bills. The only thing we don\u2019t split costs on is groceries. Everyone\u2019s in charge of buying their own food and we don\u2019t touch whatever doesn\u2019t belong to us in the fridge. We put our names on everything so no one gets mixed up. \n\nThis issue has been going on almost a year and I\u2019m sick of it. \n\nOne of my roommates, R, keeps stealing my food. I get home from work and containers with my leftovers are sometimes missing (they have my name written on it), or my stuff finishes too quick. My gallon of milk for example. I buy almond milk because I like the taste. But it seems to finish after a week even though I\u2019ve only drank once or twice. \n\nI confronted R about this lots of times and that\u2019s caused a lot of arguments. He outright denies it and tells me I\u2019m crazy even though it\u2019s so obvious. \n\nMy other roommate and I carpool together because we both work the same early morning shifts around the same area so I know it\u2019s not him. It\u2019s always after we get back home and R\u2019s already left for work that I notice my food\u2019s gone. My roommate\u2019s also had a similar problem but not as often as I do. I\u2019m guessing cause R doesn\u2019t like what he buys.\n\nThe funny thing is R buys a lot for himself and is even more stingy about his food. He will literally point out what\u2019s his when he comes back from grocery shopping and tells us not to touch it.\n\nLast week, my milk was nearly empty again and I got fed up. I went to the liquor store and bought regular dairy milk. I drank what was left of my almond milk and refilled the gallon with the one I bought. This was to catch/prove R is the one stealing since he\u2019s lactose intolerant. \n\nThe nxt day, Saturday, we get back from work and R is pissed. He yelled at me that he was stuck in the bathroom for 40 mins with diarrhea because of my milk; he was using it to make a shake. I only responded with \u201cSo then you\u2019re the one who\u2019s been stealing?\u201d \n\nHe freaking exploded. Yeah he admitted he was \u201csometimes\u201d drinking my milk and eating my food but he was more mad that I switched milks than the fact that he was caught. I told him I wouldn\u2019t have done that if he\u2019d just stopped taking my stuff from the fridge or at least told the truth instead of tryna make it seem like I was making it up.\n\nMy roommate backed me up and thought it was kinda funny he got payback for stealing from us. It\u2019s a little tense rn and my roommate told me R is trying to convince him to agree to kick me out. Little does he know we\u2019re both looking to move somewhere else together cause we are sick of his shit.  \n\nI told some buddies what happened and a few think I was an asshole for that. I feel like I\u2019m not in the wrong here. He was taking my food and not even owning up to it and I wanted to prove it, does that make me TA?",

They have a 7 layer bar flavor that's like stupid good, and their dairy free recipe is super creamy and amazing. Some of their nondairy flavors are actually better than the regular dairy versions, I think. The subtle flavor of nut-based milk alternatives compliments certain recipes quite nicely, and you don't get that horrible aftertaste dairy milk leaves behind.  SO Delicious makes a cashew milk based salted caramel cluster \"frozen dessert\" that's famously yummy too. I mean I've had some pretty bad non-dairy replacement products that really are disappointing, but Ben &amp; Jerry's makes exactly none of them.",

He had stolen from my ex's very elderly grandmother, and he even took the ENTIRE BOTTLE of his girlfriend's vicodin as soon as she got home from getting her wisdom teeth removed. Luck would have it that I had an empty bottle of Rx painkillers, and he already knew that I had painkillers for a recent injury. We were at my ex's mom's house, where his sister was staying and frequently having her sleazbag bf over. Well, my ex and I did some research on how many laxatives a person can take without it becoming actually dangerous, picked some up, and tossed them in my vicodin bottle. I buried it in my (zipped up) purse, and \"accidentally\" left it in the bathroom. Less than an hour later, the bottle in my purse was empty. We told my ex's sister pretty soon after what was in there (along with reminders that I can put whatever the fuck I want in a prescription bottle with my name in it, in my own sealed purse, in a home I practically lived in) but it took years for her to admit that he got horribly ill that day. It's been over a decade, but my ex and I are still friends and love to laugh about it.",

At least, that's my understanding of these types of situations in general. I could be wrong, and rules probably vary by jurisdiction.",

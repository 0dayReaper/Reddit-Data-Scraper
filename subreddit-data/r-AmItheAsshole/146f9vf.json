I'm the first kid and my sisters are 5 and 9.5 years younger than me, so I knew a lot more of the ''middle class'' era rather than upper middle class ( My dad was still in uni when I was born and now he's the director of an accounting office so the difference is pretty huge).\n\nI'm moving out for college and I need a laptop, and a lot of the pieces in the current desktop were bought by me ( paid around 600$(CAD)). At first, I considered leaving with the desktop and buying a just decent laptop, but my dad told me I could get a gaming laptop that would work for school as well for my birthday. He bought it yesterday and told me I'll get it next week, and casually dropped that it cost 1400$(cad).\n\nI know laptops are expensive but I didn't expect it to cost that much, and I asked him if he wanted me to chip in. He said it was alright and wouldn't have bought it if didn't want to pay that much.\n\nThis feels like wayyyy too much and I started spiraling  and told my best friend about it. His reply when I told him I was having mixed feelings because it felt like I didn't deserve this was :'' Lmao you don't''\n\nI know it was just a joke but it really left a bad taste and I ended up telling him that I should've gone to L (our other friend) because it seemed like he wasn't mature enough to help me.\n\nHe got upset and said he doesn't know how to answer to those things and tried to lighten the mood by saying the first thing that came into his mind.\n\nAt that point I was definitely more emotional than rational and said that even my sisters would have the emotional intelligence to realise this was the single worst thing he could reply in this situation. He did not like being compared to a 8 year old who needs the presence of a parent to go to the end of year school trip because of bad behavior and got mad at me.\n\nWas I the asshole for comparing my friend to an 8yo after he jokingly told me I didn't deserve the gift?\n\nTLDR: I learnt i'm getting a 1 400$ (CAD) birthday gift and spiraled, told my friend how I felt and told him even my sisters had the emotional intelligence to know joking about it like he did was the worst thing to do in that case.",

There is no reason to spiral over it, it is just luck. Many of us get stuff we don't deserve from relatives if they have money. What your friend said was dumb, but also true, you haven't done anything special to deserve it. And that is fine, perfectly fine. Just say thank you to dad and keep good care of the laptop.\n\n\nI think that none this should be big issue, that it was means there is some unresolved issue somewhere.",

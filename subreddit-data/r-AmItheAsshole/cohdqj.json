    "postText": "I am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. Both of them had spouses at the time. My birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when I was conceived so there was no way I was his. A few months after I was born they decided not to divorce. I was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.\r\n\r\nBoth my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents. Recently I decided that I wanted to know more about my dad's family and I sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so I could get to know him. Well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over Skype. They both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. \r\n\r\nWell I did pretty much the opposite. I contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. She is now divorcing him while on my mother's side I told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother. \r\n\r\nCurrently my siblings on both sides lives have been upturned and after the satisfaction has worn off I feel like I unnecessarily hurt them through my parents. AITA for ruining my parents marriages?",

I didn\u2019t know a lot and just figured it out on my own.\n\nWhen I was 12 or so, I was in bed when it just hit me.  It just popped into my head and had never occurred to me before.  My parents were married in 1969.  My sister was born in 1967.  \n\nMy mom was, coincidentally, on her way to bed.  I asked her about the discrepancy.  \u201cOh.  Yeah.  She\u2019s your half sister.  Goodnight.\u201d  ZOOM to bed.\n\nWHAT?  WTF?  It took time but I got the story.  Sister\u2019s sperm donor would never be in the picture.  Dad came into their lives when my sister was 2.  They got married fast, dad was in the navy, eloped, all that.  Mom was a divorced Catholic with a kid marrying a Southern Baptist from Idaho and when he put her on the phone with gram she was terrified.  First words out of gram\u2019s mouth?  \u201cSo I hear I have a new granddaughter!\u201d  \n\nWhen my sister was old enough to understand that dad was the only dad who would be in her life, mom and dad asked if she wanted him to adopt her.  She said yes.  Now, my sister and dad fought.  A lot, growing up.  A *lot*.  But never, not once in my life did I ever hear \u201cyou aren\u2019t my dad\u201d or did dad treat her any differently than me.\n\nPeople are very good at setting a narrative and settling in.  They forget that the people they have set that narrative for will eventually get curious.  They are in the background, listening, hearing, putting pieces together.  And what\u2019s more, it\u2019s even more obvious when something is being hidden from you.  You get curious and don\u2019t stop until you figure it out.  \n\nTruths out.  The bigger, the uglier, the more they out.  They work their way to the surface like a splinter, infecting and annoying you until they are purged.",

We don't have to blame them on cheating (that's hormonal/human), but all the lies and not owning to what they did is 100% a choice and 100% an asshole's choice. And they were imposing you this choice retaining any agency from you. Even if what you did can seem a bit brutal (on others) from your perspective, it was the way to reclaim the agency they were taking away from you (can't free your chains w/o breaking them). If you feel bad for your siblings, think how they lived in a world of lies and deception before that. Sure their lives were happy and easy; but down the line maybe when they have their own kids and turn back to their own parents for support/advice they'll be grateful to know what kind of person their parents really are. Y'all are dealing with shitty parents and it's gonna be tough for a while! But you have each other + your own agency and that's priceless. NTA!",

Your parents for obvious reasons, and you for intentionally ruining someone's life for your own satisfaction.\n\nDid you have a reason for it, sure. But being a vengeful asshole is still being a vengeful asshole. Note, I'm not saying that you're a bad person by any means, most people including myself probably understand why you'd do what you did. But I do think you're a bit of a dick for intentionally doing it.\n\nNow, if it had happened accidentally for example because your father's wife had accidentally seen the message on your dad's phone, that wouldn't have been explicitly your fault, and you would not be an asshole here, but purposely doing this is a different matter.\n\nEdit: Because people somehow have trouble reading it, here's a clarification:\n\nMALICIOUS, VENGEFUL = ASSHOLE\n\nNOT MALICIOUS, ACCIDENTAL = NOT ASSHOLE\n\nMotivations matter, people. Unlike legal matters, intentions are important when judging whether a behaviour is assholish.\n\nE2: Enjoyed the discussion, at least with the civil fellows, but I'm a tad overwhelmed with the sheer amount of replies, so gonna just go sleep. Everyone remember that it's fine to have differing opinions here, and have a nice day :)",

The parents are vile sphincters, and a kid burning down innocent lives (his siblings' and his dad's wife) because he's (rightfully) pissed about something out of his control is still an asshole. Your half siblings will now have broken families, OP, and your parents aren't really going to open their arms to you either, so the net gain of your actions is that EVERYONE is now smeared with shit, which does nothing to clean the shit off your own past that you used as an excuse to do this.",

That is a parent's job; sending money is not enough. They could have placed you for a real adoption and given you a family with no secrets.\n\nI actually don't think it's your fault thst either of your parents' marriages blew up or their other kids are pissed with them now.

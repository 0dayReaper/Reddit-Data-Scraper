Helen, (21 F) got drunk and acted really crazy. Which sounds funny at first, but she was being really rude and inconsiderate. She\u2019s known for getting really wild when she drinks, but this time was a little different. I had to wake up early the next day so I called it an early night for me. Eventually, my other friend, Jennifer (22 F), was telling me about all the things Helen was doing after I left. She was flinging drinks on people, throwing food, drinking other people\u2019s drinks, making rude comments to the people taking care of her, and just her overall behavior made our friends upset and uncomfortable.\n\nEventually Helen started recalling the night\u2019s events, and her attitude was very much thinking it was funny because she was a crazy drunk girl and was excited for the next time. Seeing that Helen wasn\u2019t taking anything seriously, Jennifer called her out and told her she can\u2019t be doing all that. Helen got defensive and told her she needed to drop the issue, whereas Jennifer told her to take accountability. Helen said she was taking accountability and told her to chill. A lot of people were on Jennifer\u2019s side in private, but they stood back when Jennifer and Helen went back and forth a bit. Helen didn\u2019t seem to understand that it was a big deal to us, so I suggested to her to try to be more considerate towards her friends\u2019 feelings because they\u2019re obviously upset and want the behavior to stop. She snapped at me saying that she already told everyone sorry that night. Jennifer ended the argument by telling Helen that she\u2019ll never be around her when she\u2019s drinking again, &amp; Helen said that was fine by her. \n\nJennifer thanked me for speaking up, but Helen is cold with me now. I\u2019m really frustrated by how she\u2019s dealing with the situation, but now I\u2019m wondering if I made the proper judgement if I wasn\u2019t there to witness the events. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

    "postText": "I (24f) am engaged to another woman who\u2019s around the same age as me. I just noticed my aunt post some stuff about how \u201cmarriage is between a man and a woman\u201d on fb. She\u2019s done this in the past too. \nThe first time, my dad called her out and cut off contact for a long time. However, he later started speaking to her again after a death in the family, stating that he realizes that you never know when someone could pass away. I can understand his feelings, it\u2019s his sister, but it still hurts. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand why I can\u2019t do the same though and has gotten mad that I won\u2019t invite her to my wedding. She, for some reason, WANTS to go to my wedding.\n I really wanna type a comment that says something like \u201cwhy tf do you even wanna go to my wedding if you don\u2019t even think it\u2019s a valid marriage?\u201d I know if I post it, one of two things will happen. 1. My parents will get mad at me and a big argument will break out and they\u2019ll be thinking about it during their entire vacation. 2. Or they will be like wtf aunt?? Argue with HER, and have to deal with that heat for a whole cruise and ruin my cousin\u2019s retirement party. I don\u2019t wanna cause shit at a bad time, but I\u2019m so tired and haven\u2019t been able to get my meds (state\u2019s health care sucks) so my mood is really wack.\n I know I shouldn\u2019t be following he in the first place, but small dumb part of me just hopes I can finally get my parents to see she is a pos, like they did in the past. I do love my parents and, at the very least, they finally agreed to go to family therapy and wanna be friends encouraging if they agreed to take some steps to help us get better, but I hate dad\u2019s sister so fucking much. WIBTA? Should I wait to confront her?",

He has some very, very strong viewpoints and opinions.\n\nI don't agree with a majority of the things he has said for the last 30 years - but it hasn't changed the fact that he is genuinely interested in me, my life and the stuff I am doing. \n\nWhile your aunt may believe that a \"marriage is between a man and a woman\", it is plausible that she wants to go to the wedding because she gives a sh\\_t about you, her niece, as a person.\n\nPersonally, I would refrain from putting/posting anything online. That stuff, once written, is there forever. You may delete it, but screenshots are taken, and people don't forget. \n\nYou said you understand that he started speaking to your aunt again after a death in the family, as his thoughts were that you never know when someone will pass away. This is true. I spent the better part of 30 years being sh\\_tty with someone (not my uncle BTW), and then they died - now, as time passes and I get older I wonder why any of it mattered. \n\nFor you, marry the woman of your dreams and be happy and confident with what you are doing. You don't need to change the world or viewpoint of everyone around you. \n\nGood luck, I hope your wedding is beautiful and that family, or other ideations that don't align with yours don't ruin your day.",

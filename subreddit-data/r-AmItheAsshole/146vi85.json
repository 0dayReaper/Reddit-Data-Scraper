I\u2019m an experienced player and my aunt and my sister, especially my aunt, expressed interest in hanging out with me and in going to play, in the city. I didn\u2019t really say much at first but then before my aunt left, she directly asked me about hanging out and bringing her with me or meeting her at the arcade, to play DDR. I felt pressured to say yes at the time, so I said yes.\r  \n\r  \nThe issue is - I don\u2019t really want to hang out with them and would rather go alone, to be honest. In general, I prefer to do things alone than with other people. Now I regret even bringing up DDR.\r  \n\r  \nWIBTA if I was honest with my aunt and told her that honestly, I\u2019d rather go alone, if she asks me about why I didn\u2019t reach out to her when I said I would?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

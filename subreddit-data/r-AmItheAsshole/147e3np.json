She wouldn\u2019t have told me either unless I had asked her who else was going. \n\nFor context my friend and ex are on a sports team together. I won\u2019t mention what kind since they\u2019re both on Reddit. They had been on this team since my ex and I were still together and were on friendly terms. They even went out for drinks together alone while they were deciding on starting a band. I was fine with all of this because I trusted them both. \n\nAfter the breakup and having confided in my friend about all the emotional abuse I went through with my ex she claims she blocked him and wasn\u2019t on friendly terms with him anymore. None of which I ever saw though and I saw that she was still liking his pics and following him. \n\nTo cut her some slack I was in between some back and forth deciding whether I could be friends with him again after the breakup after he insisted on trying to make amends but after working with a therapist. (I am a people pleaser in the process of breaking people pleasing habits) I decided I couldn\u2019t be friends with him anymore. \n\nThroughout this she\u2019s posting happy go lucky pictures with him during their training rounds and even went to his house warming after the breakup. \n\nSo it took me off guard to hear about him going on this trip and since we were in the car on the way to the airport I was dumbfounded and didn\u2019t really have anything to say in that moment. \n\nI sent her a text afterwards to express my feelings about her not telling me and she basically justified her actions by saying since I had flip flopped about being friends with him myself it wasn\u2019t fair of me to have these feelings\u2026",

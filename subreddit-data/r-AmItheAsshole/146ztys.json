    "postText": "I (25F) got angry at my boyfriend (31M) for resting his feet in flip flops on a seat in front of him while we were on the bus on the way to the beach. One of his sandals was pressed against the bottom of the pole for people to hang onto, so not really in the area that peoples hands touch. His other foot was touching the seat, but not a lot because his foot was flexed upright. A small part of his heel and the bottom of his sandal was touching the seat.\n\nThis makes me angry because I think it\u2019s inconsiderate to the general public to spread the germs from the bottom of your shoes onto the area that people sit on. My boyfriend doesn\u2019t seem to care about this, as this is a somewhat regular occurrence for him. I always tell him to stop but this time he didn\u2019t listen to me and insisted on keeping his feet elevated on the seat and said he has long legs and wanted to rest them upright. I called him disgusting for this. \n\nI want to add that I\u2019m Canadian and he\u2019s American. I\u2019ve recently been discussing with Canadian friends the differences between us and Americans and my friends believe Canadians are more considerate. I honestly hadn\u2019t thought about it too much but now I think they might be right. \n\nSo AITA for calling my boyfriend disgusting for insisting on resting his feet on a bus seat?",

The seat could be legitimate. \n\nI\u2019ve also had literally about 7 knee surgeries where my knee had to be elevated, but I usually tried to angle it so my ankle was on the seat, not the sole of my shoe. Just for reference and so you know my biases. \n\nIf your anger is affecting you, or you\u2019re quick to anger/anger often, please find a professional to talk to.

It was originally supposed to be the day before my birthday. But because of something that my sister has going on, and that\u2019s where they\u2019re having it, they had to change it to a week earlier..\n\n First off, my two dogs are my entire life and I want them there for me. But my sister\u2019s got dogs of her own, and her house is just too small. and my dogs cannot be outside all day it\u2019s way too hot (I have bulldogs). so I can\u2019t bring my dogs. \n\nBut then they moved the date. the new date is the anniversary of my papa\u2018s passing. It has been two years. My papa raised me. He literally taught  me everything I know, and I\u2019m still not over losing him. (It is my papa on my mothers side and this sister is my step sister on my fathers side) It\u2019s also my soul dog in heaven\u2018s birthday on the same day that my papa passed and now they want to celebrate . I spent all day on that day by myself last year. And I planned on doing it again this year. \n\nAm I the asshole for asking them just move to a different time or have it at my house (and a different day) so that my dogs can be there AND it\u2019s not the anniversary of one of the worst days of my life?\n\nI don\u2019t even want to go. Not at all. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

    "postText": "\n\nI F30 don't have the best relationship with my husband's mom. Since day one she tried to make remarks and compare me to her ??. She then tried to get on my good side and started overly praising everything I do and sometimes even copying me like that one time when she LITERALLY dyied her hair purple just like mine and when everyone pointed out how ridiculous she looked, she actually blamed me and accused me of trying to make a joke out of her.\n\n\n\nSo, Anyways! My husband and I took 2 weeks off work to go visit some places out of the country - tourism in other words. Thing is I was the one who saved up for and arranged for the trip (my husband was responsible for booking the tickets). My husband's mom wanted to come along and threw temper tantrums when I said no. She called, texted, sent people to talk to me into letting her come, even threatened to call the police and make some complaint up to get us to stay if she can't come. My husband said we should just take her but I told him he was wrong to tell her about the trip in the first place. He gave me an ultimatim. said he wouldn't go if she can't come and I told him I'd gladly call his bluff which made him take his words back and say \"FINE! I will tell her to stop it because we won't take her\".\n\nThings got quieter, suspeciously quieter. the day of the trip came and we got to the airport at 2pm. My husband was walking ahead of me and was looking left and right like he was looking for someone. I asked him but he didn't respond. He lead me to the waiting area and first thing I saw was his mom standing there with her luggage . I froze in my spot, I felt a cold wave washing over me and I was fuming inside. She and my husband were hugging that's when I quietly turned around and started walking towards the exit. My husband followed me while shouting at me to stop. he tried to stop me but I told him off the harshest way possible. He tried to say I was overreacting and that his mom was there \"anyway\" and I should let it go and not mess the trip up for us. I told him he and his mom could still go and that I was going home.\n\nI went home and sobbed into my dog's fur for several minutes. turned out he booked her a ticket without me knowing. an hour later he came home yelling and raging about how pathetic and spiteful I was to walk out and go home and ruin the trip last minute. I told him he caused this to happen. he said that I was being so hard on his mom it's ridiculous. I refused to fight any more but he kept on berating me then called my family to tell them that the trip was cancelled and that it was because of me. My family said that I shouldn't have ruined it for myself and should've sucked it up and done my best to enjoy.\n\nDid I really overreact?",

I would vent the problem then willfully ignore that he might be the instigator and make excuses for him and his behavior. It exhausted my friends. It took him cheating and telling me that he was moving in his 18 year old gf (he was 27 and I was 26) for me to take our daughter and leave. This was after years of suspected cheating and emotional abuse. I have gotten better with relationships since then but it's still difficult for me to not make excuses for the people I care about. Some people don't leave easily. Some people don't have an issue with knowing their own worth and gtfo but OP seems to have an issue with it. It's a struggle.\n\nEdit* Not that anyone asked or anything but I'm now 33 and in a better situation and better relationship. We're getting married in February. It's amazing to see the difference in how a relationship and communication should be and what I've had in the past, even if we're not perfect at it. My daughter (13) thinks he's fantastic and we're thinking of having more children. She rarely sees her dad because he puts forth no effort in seeing her and doesn't want visitations. So I'm glad we got out, even if it took me far too long and an impossible situation to realize I needed to leave.",

That's hugely disturbing because it doesn't end here and this is emotional abuse.\n\nIn another comment you said you paid for the trip... does your husband have a job? What is money like? I have a suspicion you're being taken advantage of financially as well given all the huge red flags here. Is this guy and his mom freeloading off you?\n\nI'd normally suggest couples counseling and maybe you could try it, but honestly I think this might go too far to be recoverable. This is not ok and please don't let yourself be treated like this - you need to get away and gain perspective before they warp your sense of reality even more.\n\nDo you have a friend you could stay with? I'd suggest going to see a therapist to re-establish your sense of what is right and wrong and gain clarity over what decisions you need to make.",

Other people often end up going along with it because  1) they dont know any better, 2) they have been told a distorted version of the story, or 3) they don't want to incur the wrath of MIL so its easier to just tell others to do what she wants.",

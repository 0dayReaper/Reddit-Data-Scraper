I had a crush on this boy that I will call Leo. We had a Steam class together. It was originally a regular crush that didn't mean anything, but by early January I started to want to be with him more and more. Me, my best friend of 5 years that I will call sarah and our mutual friend that I will call Carrie were sitting together on the bleachers during gym. Leo was playing badminton with his friends and we were looking in his direction. Sarah begins to start to talk about how she thinks Leo is cute with me and Carrie which I don't really say anything to be supportive to her(FIRST MISTAKE).\r  \n Time skip to late February early March Sarah says that she's over Leo (I still do have a crush on him, and my feelings were still suppressed at this point) and we are transitioning from  Steam to Facs class. About a week after our transition, I make it open to Sarah, Carrie, Abby, and Delilah that I have a crush on Leo and they all seem like they are supportive of me having a crush on him. Carrie, Abby, and Delilah all are trying to get me to confess to Leo but I was scared to. Abby and Delilah would make jokes and tease me when asking Leo questions about what we were supposed to be doing. About a week or so before we transition from sewing to cooking, Sarah starts to act weird around me and Leo but I think nothing of it(SECOND MISTAKE). \r  \nOnce we switch it's a week or two before May and we don't get to start cooking because of Ramadanso we are doing google slides and kahoots. After Ramadan, we finally get to start cooking and we are making Orange Julius'. This week, Sarah starts acting even more weird around Leo and I take notice of it. I don't feel that I should say anything to Sarah because she is my best friend and I know she would never do anything like that to me. fast forward a week, she starts talking to him after class and staring admiringly into his eyes, starts ignoring me more after first period (me and Leo have the same first period and she usually speaks to me since she has that teacher for second period) and walking to classes with him. I still don't say anything(THIRD MISTAKE).\r  \nId say, that Friday (if not the next), is when Sarah said that she and Leo were talking. My Friend that sits at our lunch table was talking about track and Sarah began asking questions about Leo. I jokingly said what revealed the main reason of this post.\r  \nM= me, S= Sarah\r  \nM: Why are you asking about Leo?\r  \nS= Oh, didn't you know? Me and Leo are talking.\r  \nM= Obviously confused, my expression drops I stop talking and I turn my face away. at this point, my heart has sunk\r  \nS=Continues to ask my friend questions about Leo when everyone but her can tell that I am visibly annoyed at her conversation\r  \n(more in response)",

            "comment": "(part 2)\n\nAfter lunch, I vented a bit to my friends while we were walking to class about how I didn't understand why Sarah would do that to me. I asked my friends and they said they'd stop being friends with her if they were me. I ask Carrie the same question after telling her what happened and she gives the same answer. Carrie also tells me that Sarah spoke to her about the situation and told her that she would \"feel bad for OP\" when talking about it. Carrie asked if she would tell me but she never did until that day. Another fast-forward to the last 4 weeks of school, Sarah progressively gets worse and worse around Leo, to the point where I heard her talking about me to him. Up until the 3rd to last Tuesday, where he comes over to her house to make their relationship \"official\". the same week she is giving relationship advice to another one of my friends. The weeks continue to our graduation date and at least 2-3 times a week he stares at me and I see them walking to every class together. At our graduation, it is packed as we are in the fieldhouse and there are 300 of us. After going to the bathroom to freshen up, I walk back to my seat and I see Sarah, Leo, and Carrie in a group. I have to walk past them to get to my seat so I do that and tap Carrie on the arm. Leo stares at me again as if I had clown makeup on. (at this point I don't like him anymore, and I don't know what to do about the situation.) graduation goes on as usual, yada yada my laces to my heels come out and are on tape. ANYWHO.\n\nfast-forward to this week, my friends are talking about how she was constantly talking about Leo in their basketball group chat and just changing the topic of the whole conversation. They also said that they think that they broke up. I'm just wondering If I should still go through with my plan of not being her friend if she did break up with him. I think it'd be weird seeing as I never really expressed my complete feelings to her but still.",

                    "comment": "Maybe better talk to your close friends after this episode if all of you maybe should define some rules you all want to hold up, to avoid further incidents like this.\n\nOne rule everybody should follow is not to cheat or enable cheating. \nAnother one is no flirting with someone who is in a relationship, especially if he/she is in a relationship with your best friend and you see each other quite often.\nOne more is not to try to get together with someone your best friend is already making progress with and not with someone who very recently Br\u00f6ker up with your friend and she is not over them yet.\n\nIt is difficult to say if there is or should be a rule to stay distant from someone one of  your friends has a crush on. Such a rule would be quite difficult to follow as people sometimes have a crush for years without ever considering the time right to actually speak to them. And, to be honest, if the time never seems to be right, it is likely that something tells you that your crush is not really interested in you anyway and you hold high a dream and not a plan.\n\nSo of course you can try to follow this rule, but maybe with the additional rule that after three months you have no rights any more if you do not take a next step.\n\nIt is nice you have friends. It is quite likely some of them will still be your friends after lots and lots of crushes and relationships came and went. I think you should not end a long standing friendship easily, but have a good eye on everything. If someone behaves AHy again and again despite some rules you agreed to, the friendship is maybe not really worth keeping up.",

    "postText": "Recently my sister gave birth to my beautiful and healthy niece, and the other day when we were both at our parents, she asked me if I wanted to be her godfather. I told her that while I would love to, I wouldn't be a good option for a godparent, and that she needs to find someone more reliable to take up the roll. She quickly got upset with me and started to argue that I need to be involved in my niece's life and that I really need to be her godfather, to which I responded I could still have a place in her life while she picked more reliable people to take up that position.\n\nFor some context, I have health problems that limit my physical activity, and only just make enough to get by on my own. In my current position, I wouldn't be able to support my niece financially or be a properly active parent in her life should something happen to my sister and brother-in-law.\n\nEver since the argument, my sister has been blowing up my phone, and has even started to complain to our parents and the rest of our family about it. My parents are furious with me, and my mom says it is more of a social obligation than anything. The only one who seems to be on my side is one of our aunts, but she hasn't spoken to my sister about the matter at all as she feels this is a matter she has no say in.\n\nI am posting here now cause just an hour ago, my sister made a big fuss about no longer having a brother on social media and it has me regretting everything.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: A lot of people have pointed out that I am confusing being a godparent with legal guardian. It was honestly my understanding that being a godparent was to accept the role of being ones legal guardian in the event something happens to the parents of the child. I have asked my aunt if she can broach the subject with my sister as I currently do not feel comfortable contacting my sister after what she posted to social media just a few hours ago. I will give an update after I either get info from my aunt or am able to talk to my sister when she has had time to calm down as all this has happened over the span of 3 days.\n\nUPDATE: My aunt spoke to my sister, and she did apparently mean for me to become a legal guardian for my niece. My aunt is also having us both meet up at her house tomorrow so that we can try to talk this out amicably on neutral grounds.\n\nFINAL UPDATE: So I spoke to my sister at our Aunts House. She was still pretty upset with me for not wanting to be my nieces godparent/legal guardian, but was regretting her earlier comment about no longer having a brother. I got her to remember how bad of a position I am in and we can't predict the future, but I'm not saying that I don't want to be a part of my nieces life and am willing to be there for her as much as I can be. She seemed to finally think about it and take things in, and is now considering a few people she believes can be reliable to take the guardian role if anything should happen to her and my in-law.\n\nFunny enough I told her about all the comments I got here about the true religious meaning of a godparent everyone kept pointing out, and her comment was \"Maybe just to please hubby's parents\" and we both got a good laugh out of it.",

If that's not her intent I'd say accept on condition it's clear in her will who should take guardianship (and that it's not you).\n\nGiven the arguments you gave it's pretty clear what your concerns are though, so I suspect she would expect you to take guardianship, or she would have said otherwise.instead of just getting offended.",

It doesn't carry legal implications or would be taken into consideration if the worst happens and both parents are gone. It's not some next in line legal maneuver that places the responsibility of the child on you. It's the equivalent of being the assistant manager. You show up, pretend to be important and leave because when shit hits the fan the GM (the parents) handle it and if something happens to the GM the regional manager (the government)sorts it out and family members can try to see what's in the best interest of the kid(s)",

If it is a guardian role like you\u2019re envisioning, your refusal was the kind and best thing for your niece. Feels like you\u2019re arguing from completely different perspectives. Close that perception gap and then your decision needs to stand and she needs to get over herself.",

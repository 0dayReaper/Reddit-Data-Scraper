    "postText": "My son will be a senior in high school this fall and we have been touring colleges. We toured a few this spring and plan to tour several out of state ones throughout the summer. The plan was for myself, my husband, and his father to do the tours together. We\u2019ll be touring 4 schools, and he\u2019s coming to 3 of them. \n\nSome background: my son\u2019s father and I split up before our son was 6 months old. Soon after our relationship ended, I met my now husband and we got married when son was 3. My ex has been supportive of our relationship and thinks my husband is a great stepfather. Our coparenting relationship has been challenging at times but we\u2019ve done just fine for the sake of our son. Last year, my ex eloped with this woman, Shelly (not her real name). They dated for only a year or so before marrying. I don\u2019t know her too well since we\u2019ve only met twice but I know she has three kids of her own, her oldest is about the same age as my son. My son dislikes her. He thinks Shelly is mentally unhinged, is way too involved in his personal business, and he blames her for being the reason he hasn\u2019t been able to spend as much quality time with his father lately.\n\nEarlier this week, I was coordinating with my ex about the details of our next tour. Everything was great until he mentioned that Shelly would be coming along on all our tours. I asked why and if it was necessary that she tag along. He said that she just wanted to be supportive. I asked him if her daughter was looking at these schools too, since she\u2019s also going to be a senior, and he said no. So why is she coming if her own child isn\u2019t planning on attending those schools? I told him that our son should get a say in who comes to the tours and that I would ask him what he thought about Shelly joining us. After I got off the phone with my ex, I asked our son if he wanted Shelly to come with us. He immediately replied no and that he wasn\u2019t comfortable with her coming.  I told our son that he should speak with his father and let him know about what he thinks. \n\nFast forward to last night, my ex calls and is furious that I would \u201cget our son involved in this matter.\u201d I replied that our son is the one touring the colleges and making decisions about his future, and he gets to decide who can come along. Not to mention, our son is almost an adult and at his age is more than capable of deciding who he wants in his life and to what extent. Son has been vocal to his father about his feelings about Shelly. He accepts that his father loves her but he doesn\u2019t see her as family. So I told my ex that if he loves his son and wants to continue having a positive relationship with him, then he needs to respect his wishes and leave his wife at home. End of story. Ex replies that I\u2019m an AH, Shelly cares about our son, and that he should be allowed to bring his wife with him whenever he chooses. \n\nWas I wrong? AITA?\n\nUPDATE: First of all, thanks for the validation and the kind words some left. I\u2019ve read nearly everything you all have left so thank you. I\u2019d like to emphasize for anyone who may have missed it in my original post that my son has been the main one communicating his boundaries to his dad, not me. My son is 17 and more than capable of setting and enforcing his own boundaries. Also, since some expressed that it\u2019s hypocritical for my husband to be there but not Shelly, let me reiterate that my son ASKED his stepdad to come along on the tours! And ex is fine with him being there and it was never an issue in the first place. There\u2019s also a lot more to the story behind why my son doesn\u2019t like Shelly that I couldn\u2019t explain in my original post. If it was up to me, I\u2019d like him to get to know her better but, I understand his reasons, and I honor them. I\u2019m certainly not pitting him against her like some of you implied. \n\nI talked to my son late last night about his father being upset about him not wanting Shelly to come along. I told him that I fully respected his choice and reminded him that he can share this experience with whomever he wants. I encouraged him to talk to his dad again, explain his feelings about the situation, and I let him know that I was happy to step in if he needed me. I also added that if he ultimately decided that he wanted to go on these tours alone or with just one parent to avoid drama (which I communicated might be the best option but that\u2019s just my opinion and he doesn\u2019t need to consider it if he doesn\u2019t want to) that that would be okay too. It\u2019s his tours, and his decisions. \n\nSo he called his dad this morning and calmly told him that he didn\u2019t want Shelly coming along on any of the tours and explained his reasons, which mainly included needing time with his dad sans Shelly, and him not wanting an \u201centourage\u201d accompanying him on his tours. \u201cFive is a crowd, dad.\u201d (I lol\u2019d when he said that.) This time my ex was more receptive and told our son that he respected his feelings. But then he put son on the spot and told him he should to talk to Shelly directly about her not coming. He was not comfortable with that and requested that I step in and talk to both his dad and Shelly. So I got on the phone and repeated that this was our son\u2019s decision. I didn\u2019t say anything about son disliking Shelly or feeling uncomfortable around her, because that is beside the point. Shelly was clearly disappointed, and said she understood and only wanted an opportunity to bond with her new stepson. I replied that it was sweet of her to want to get to know him better but a college tour isn\u2019t the time nor place. Overall, she seemed to be okay with it. We spoke for another minute or two and then she left the conversation and I talked to ex for a little while.\n\nI reiterated to him that ever since Shelly came into the picture, our son feels like he doesn\u2019t get as much quality time with his dad anymore because either she\u2019s there during their entire time together or he\u2019s busy being a stepfather to her kids (son doesn\u2019t have an issue with his step-siblings but also I want to make sure ex makes time for his own kid). I also explained to him that if Shelly not coming was going to be this big of a deal to him, then he shouldn\u2019t come either. He said he understood where I was coming from and apologized for calling me an AH. I asked him if it was Shelly who was pushing this issue or if it was him. Based on his response, I got the sense that Shelly expressed an interest in going, was okay not going if that was really son\u2019s decision, but my ex just really wants her to feel more like a part of his family so it\u2019s a mix of him appeasing her but also wanting his son to get to know her better. So I gave him two choices: either he comes without Shelly and uses those opportunities to have special time with his son, or he doesn\u2019t come to the tours and we find a weekend for him and son to spend one-on-one time but either way, Shelly isn\u2019t going to be there because our son isn\u2019t interested in a relationship with her right now and he shouldn\u2019t force it onto him. He said he\u2019d think about his choices. So all good there! I hope he decides to leave Shelly at home and come to whatever tours he can because I know how important it is to our son.",

On the other hand, teenagers are quite fast to form opinions, and strong ones too.\n\nShelly is basically an extra person tacked onto his family in his later teenage years, so it shouldn't be surprising that he doesn't see her as his family.

He is very capable of making his own decisions, including in the eyes of the law when it comes to parenting/visitation/etc.  He has decided who he wants to be with him when he is making big decisions about his life, and he doesn't want Shelly there. OP has decided to respect his decision over catering to what the ex and stepmom want. \n\nEven if OP loves that her son isn't a fan of the new step mom, what does it matter? She's respecting her son's wishes and his father is not. If, somehow, it turned out that OP was super manipulative and awful then her son will go NC one day and she will get that karma. Nothing about this post feels at all like what you are saying, though. \n\nDefacto threesome? She hasn't been with his father since before he was 3 years old. She remarried, happily, and is still married. She obviously has a tie to her sons father for life but this is just a weird freaking way to describe it. \n\nAnd Queen Bee status? You mean... giving birth to and raising a child who loves and respects her? He doesn't have to love anyone he doesn't want to love, step parent or no. Not even biological family. \n\n*He* decided what he wanted. Anyone who ignores that is the asshole.",

It sounds like she is trying to bond with you and your son and participate in his life but you sound angry at her because; \n\nA) she\u2019s taken the fathers time away from your son, what did you expect tbh I imagine your husband takes up some of your time away from son too only he\u2019s used to it since he grew up with it. \n\nB) you claim son said she\u2019s unhinged. Why? Is she just a bit different than you, second husband and son or has she done something to actually deserve to be called such. Maybe she has autism, adhd, mental health issues which make her a bit different than yourselves.

It just reminded me of my mom, whenever I would come come from my dad's weekend she'd ask me about my visit and everything my step mom or dad did my mom would put an ugly spin on it. I had dyslexia and was struggling with reading (my mom was a homeschool mom) my dad suggested I be tested. My mom told me she was sorry my dad thought I was stupid. I was never tested and I struggled with my assignments and would be punished for it. Turns put I am dyslexic and could have learned tricks to help me but my moms hate for my dad was more important that what was best for me and my siblings. We were in multiple after school activities and church activities and we were tired and burnt out. My dad said he was worried we had too much going on and she turned it into our dad didn't want us to socialize. I'm hoping this isn't the case with OP. I think it's odd you didn't explain why or why you didn't even let Shelly know before involving the son. Maybe dad changed after dating Shelly.",

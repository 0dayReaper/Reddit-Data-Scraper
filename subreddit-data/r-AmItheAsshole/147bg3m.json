Personally, I think it's really weird for a mother to get her son a mug that says what a good brother he's been rather than one that says what a good son he's been, but if you really want to get him a mug like that (and are prepared to explain the oddness of the gift), that's your business. But you do *not* get to sign my name to a gift that I didn't authorize and that doesn't represent my feelings. BTW, now that I know you are willing to misrepresent who a gift comes from, I'm going to be skeptical of any gift he 'gives' me in the future, since I can't be sure it really came from him.\"\n\nNTA. You have the right to decide what kinds of gifts you want to give and besides, a \"touching gift\" is completely meaningless if it doesn't come from the heart.",

It's not like you're gonna use that mug to drink your coffee every morning and remind yourself of your brother's \"inspiration\". Kudos for standing up for yourself and taking control of your relationships. You don't owe anyone any forced sentiments or emotions, no matter how cheesy or sentimental the gift may be.

I don\u2019t know where she got it. But it had all of this printing on it that said all of this very sentimental stuff about \u201cBrother, you are my inspiration and I am proud to be your sister.\u201d Super vomit worthy. My brother and I don\u2019t have that kind of relationship. He\u2019s never acted like a mentor to me. He\u2019s always been kind of rude to me, he\u2019s a lot older so he likes to tell me what to do and how to behave. I don\u2019t hate him or anything. But he\u2019s not a \u201cgreat inspiration\u201d to me at all. \n\nShe told me, didn\u2019t ask me, she was going to send him this mug, like oh by the way, and sign my name on the from. I had to physically stop her from sending this to him. Then she cried. I tried to explain why this wasn\u2019t ok. But she made me feel like I\u2019m the meanest person alive for not just being ok with her, like taking over my life in my relationship with my brother. \n\nNow I feel terrible for stopping her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

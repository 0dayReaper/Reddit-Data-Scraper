    "postText": "My boyfriend (29M) and I (28F) have been planning a beach/camping trip with several of our close friends for the last few weeks. On the day of the trip, my boyfriend got food poisoning and was unable to travel with us, so he stayed behind.\n\nI felt really bad about leaving him behind, but he did want his poor food choices (I warned him at the time) to hamper our fun. The trip was awesome; we did plenty of swimming, sunbathing, and so on.\n\nDuring the trip, I mainly interacted with two of my friends (28F and 27F) and one of my boyfriend's friends (30M), but I did chat with everyone else whenever I had the opportunity. Unfortunately, I sprained my ankle while playing volleyball, which put a damper on my trip.\n\nM30 checked out my ankle, wrapped it, and I appreciated his help. Afterward, I was able to move around decently well, but I still had some pain. Since we planned on sleeping nearby overnight, we set up about four tents. However, one of them malfunctioned due to damage to its frame and several of us had to share. I offered to share the tent that was originally meant for me and my boyfriend (since he wasn't using it), and M30 agreed to share it with me.\n\nOverall, I'd say we had a great time. When I got back home, I called my boyfriend about our trip. While he did express minor concern about my ankle, he was much more interested in me sharing the tent with M30. We argued about it, and he said that it was a breach of trust. I got really upset at this and said that he was being too controlling and didn't trust me. We argued some more, and then my boyfriend left the call as he \"needed some air.\" AITA?",

Then my partner comes home and I find out my partner slept in the same tent as my friend. It's just not a good combination.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy boyfriend (29M) and I (28F) have been planning a beach/camping trip with several of our close friends for the last few weeks. On the day of the trip, my boyfriend got food poisoning and was unable to travel with us, so he stayed behind.\n\nI felt really bad about leaving him behind, but he did want his poor food choices (I warned him at the time) to hamper our fun. The trip was awesome; we did plenty of swimming, sunbathing, and so on. \n\nDuring the trip, I mainly interacted with two of my friends (28F and 27F) and one of my husband's friends (30M), but I did chat with everyone else whenever I had the opportunity. Unfortunately, I sprained my ankle while playing volleyball, which put a damper on my trip.\n\nM30 checked out my ankle, wrapped it, and I appreciated his help. Afterward, I was able to move around decently well, but I still had some pain. Since we planned on sleeping nearby overnight, we set up about four tents. However, one of them malfunctioned due to damage to its frame and several of us had to share. I offered to share the tent that was originally meant for me and my boyfriend (since he wasn't using it), and M30 agreed to share it with me.\n\nOverall, I'd say we had a great time. When I got back home, I called my boyfriend about our trip. While he did express minor concern about my ankle, he was much more interested in me sharing the tent with M30. We argued about it, and he said that it was a breach of trust. I got really upset at this and said that he was being too controlling and didn't trust me. We argued some more, and then my boyfriend left the call as he \"needed some air.\" AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

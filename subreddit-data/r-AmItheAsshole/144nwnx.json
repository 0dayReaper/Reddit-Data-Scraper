    "postText": "*Edited to add: I'm Canadian, not American. Marijuana is legal here and so is mailing it. My roommate also smokes it and doesn't object to it.*\n\n*ETA #2: Since his room and home office are on opposite sides of the front door and his windows open up onto the porch, and I do favours like let him use my car and be on my insurance I figured this wasn't a big ask. Though I might be wrong.*\n\nI want to know if I'm being the asshole here, or if my roommate is wrong.\n\nI'm a government contractor and the nature of my work means I can't work from home. My roommate exclusively works from home. When I get a package delivered and I'm at work, I'll text my roommate after I get the delivery notification and ask him to get the package off the porch. But most of the time he never does. I'll get home and the package will still be on the porch. I would say 99% of the time he doesn't get it before I get home. It's not an excessive amount, or multiple ones a day. I'm talking less than three in a month. I also don't expect him to immediately jump up and run to the porch, just whenever he has a minute. He always says he'll do it and then he never does. But if he orders something he immediately goes to get it when its delivered. Even if he's in the middle of work he'll drop everything to get it.\n\nMy roommate says I'm being demanding by expecting him to go get it. I'm worried about porch pirates even though it isn't a huge problem here, because it does happen sometimes. I try to get the packages redirected or delivery delayed until I'm home but that's not always possible. I especially worry about them getting stolen when my sister sends me some joints. (She grows her own marijuana and will roll it into joints for me and mail them to me). I think it's common courtesy but my roommate says it's not. If I worked from home and anyone I lived with didn't I would get their packages off the porch but my roommate says I'm wrong to expect it and if I ask and he doesn't go get it, it shouldn't be a big deal even if he replied and told me he would. We've argued about this.",

At no point he doesn't have to get up to go to the bathroom or stretch his legs? \n\nNot really worth arguing over, I just wouldn't go out of my way to do them any favors if they ask.",

In exchange, you would like him to promptly bring any parcels in for you (and any other domestic tasks that might be on your wish list - best to get it all discussed in one go). If he doesn't feel that the exchange is worthwhile, or doesn't keep up his end of it, then you stop the exchange; you'll collect your own parcels, and he can get his own car and insurance.",

    "postText": "I (26f) have twins niece and nephew Gina and Aaron (13). Their birthday celebration was last weekend. I set aside equal budget for their presents but got them different things based on their interests. Gina likes to draw and paint so I got her art supplies. Aaron likes to read and write stories so I got him some books and stationary. I bought everything at the mall and gift wrapped them before giving them to the twins. The birthday went without a hitch.\n\nA few days ago my sister called me, saying that Gina was upset that her brother got nicer stuff than hers. I was confused as their presents were very much of equal prices. It turned out I got most of Gina\u2019s stuff almost full priced while Aaron\u2019s was on deep discount. Due to credit card promotions and sales, Aaron\u2019s gifts were at almost 40% off. \n\nMy sister said I should make it up to Gina by getting her a few extra things. I told her that\u2019s ridiculous and unfair to Aaron who only got one round of birthday presents. My sister said the make up gifts I get her don\u2019t even have to be of equal value to the difference as long as I got Gina a few extra things. I stood my ground. AITA?\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t attach receipts to my gifts but the twins do go to malls and have access to online shopping websites to check for prices. Book prices are also on the covers.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (26f) have twins niece and nephew Gina and Aaron (13). Their birthday celebration was last weekend. I set aside equal budget for their presents but got them different things based on their interests. Gina likes to draw and paint so I got her art supplies. Aaron likes to read and write stories so I got him some books and stationary. I bought everything at the mall and gift wrapped them before giving them to the twins. The birthday went without a hitch.\n\nA few days ago my sister called me, saying that Gina was upset that her brother got nicer stuff than hers. I was confused as their presents were very much of equal prices. It turned out I got most of Gina\u2019s stuff almost full priced while Aaron\u2019s was on deep discount. Due to credit card promotions and sales, Aaron\u2019s gifts were at almost 40% off. \n\nMy sister said I should make it up to Gina by getting her a few extra things. I told her that\u2019s ridiculous and unfair to Aaron who only got one round of birthday presents. My sister said the make up gifts I get her don\u2019t even have to be of equal value to the difference as long as I got Gina a few extra things. I stood my ground. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

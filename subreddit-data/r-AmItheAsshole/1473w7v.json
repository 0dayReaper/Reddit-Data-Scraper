Then misogynistic comment about women \"getting small dogs\" is unbelievable but the cherry on top was \"she's not getting any younger\" (at 32 for God's sake) and \"wasting the relationship\". Everyone's right, you're the one that needs to be rehomed. I'd also recommend a huge blow to the head, see if it gets you to be a decent human being.",

We\u2019ve been official since xmas so don\u2019t live together but I stay at hers a couple nights a wk. I\u2019m not a dog lover but tolerate them, but I think it\u2019s a lot of commitment &amp; she should\u2019ve stuck to 1.\r  \n\r  \nShe\u2019s self employed &amp; WFH so she does have time for walking but she dedicates about 2-3hrs a day which I think is a lot of time to waste that could be spent doing things together. She has a deal with a WFH friend where they look after each others dogs when the other has work/social plans out of the house &amp; even have this agreement for holidays up to a week. So her social life isn\u2019t limited &amp; there are times she\u2019s left them with her friend so we can go away for weekends, but that also means that another dog is sometimes at hers for the day too. She does have a decent size garden but I dread the idea of a 3rd about for a full weekend if friend goes away\r  \n\r  \nHer &amp; her kid already picked out the pup when we met, so it wasn\u2019t a decision I had any input in. When she told me about it on the 1st date it didn\u2019t ring alarm bells bc I just assumed women preferred small dogs. Not alsatians. \r  \n\r  \nAnyway, 1 night last week she was praising how well pup training is going but training is another bone of contention for me. Shes v strict &amp; credit to her they aren\u2019t aggressive &amp; do whatever they\u2019re told, but it\u2019s annoying the older will only answer her. He will do whatever she wants but if I tell him to move or sit he ignores me &amp; look to her, if she nods he will then do my command. I can see they are too bonded to rehome that one now. She says he can sense my \u2018attitude\u2019 &amp; that\u2019s why he ignores me &amp; told me to get involved in training if I wanted more obedience but like I said, dogs are not my thing. I told her it wouldn\u2019t be too late to rehome pup if she\u2019d agree 2 is a mistake. She laughed &amp; said if I thought I\u2019d made a mistake maybe I could rehome myself, which was an AH comment as I was only trying to help. She refuses to see my POV &amp; thinks I\u2019m projecting. She doesn\u2019t understand i\u2019m trying to make her see sense. \r  \n\r  \nI showed her a rehoming site I\u2019d already found where she could find pup a good home &amp; go back to 1 which is a more manageable situation. At that point she properly lost her shit &amp; said I\u2019d crossed a line. She said she told me upfront they were getting a puppy, but I was expecting a Pug or something small. \r  \n\r  \nThen she started laughing &amp; told me to leave. She said if I forced her hand she\u2019d choose her dogs which I think is wild. She\u2019s not getting any younger &amp; throwing away relationship opportunities over this is crazy. I left it a few days expecting her to reach out but she hasn\u2019t. I get on well with her kid &amp; can see a real future for us all, but I just don\u2019t really want her dogs. I\u2019m willing to comprise on 1 if I can convince her to drop the puppy. My bro says the pre researched website was a dick move I shouldn\u2019t have shown her &amp; should apologise for that bit but I still think I was just being helpful.

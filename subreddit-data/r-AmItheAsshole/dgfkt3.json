By not telling him, they are setting you up for a LOT of drama after they die, and that's not fair to you.\n\nYour dad shouldn't be spending recklessly and counting on inheritance money to come in and fix everything. That's ridiculously irresponsible.\n\nEveryone in this situation is an asshole other than you.",

He is ASSUMING that he is getting it, which is wrong. They are handing out their inheritance as they see fit. They do not owe OP's Dad ANY money from their estate and if they want it to go to OP for any reason at all there is nothing wrong with that. He isn't being \"disinherited\" unless they told him previously he was getting a certain amount of money and now they changed it.",

It's easy to say \"well...he shouldn't expect anything\" but realistically, most of us would expect to inherit from rich parents without extenuating conditions more than just \"doesn't like my wife.\"",

My dad gifts the max he can each year to me. It pays for car payments, house down payment funds, graduate school, etc. It's money I'd be spending anyway, and money I'd be inheriting down the road anyway. Again, the goal is the same. Keep the family happy and stable and help out where they can. \n\nIt's also literally how the law works. With no will it's assumed the estate goes to the kids. Why would I assume otherwise?

Maybe the father was an asshole - definitely a bit irresponsible, but I don\u2019t think that makes him a bad person and I agree that it\u2019s not unreasonable for him to think he\u2019s getting money - but the grandparents are definitely assholes. OP, if you see this, I think you should tell your grandparents to tell your father, or maybe suggest your father goes and talks to them about it. Honestly, I think like other people mentioned, I think him not knowing is going to cause issues for both him and you after they die.",

Pretty much any other reason i think the grandparents are assholes. The love of your son and financially supporting him shouldn\u2019t be dependent on who he is married too alone. Don\u2019t get me wrong, OPs dad should have saved for retirement on his own too but can we really completely blame him? I think most of us would assume our parents aren\u2019t disinheriting us for no real reason when they haven\u2019t told us. Sure, most of us probably aren\u2019t expecting millions of dollars, but still. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m really thinking it might be a different race or religion thing and OP is hiding it (not that he should - I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be an asshole either way, but I do think people would look differently on this topic if that was the case.)\n\nEdit: actually somewhere OP said that apparently they think the stepmom is a gold digger and that and the fact he isn\u2019t responsible is why he\u2019s cutting him off.\n\nYeah, grandparents are assholes then for not talking about it a long time ago.",

Plenty of things could happen that could reduce or eliminate an inheritance, not the least of which being that the parents live longer than expected. \n\nThat happened in my family, by the way. My parents weren't counting on an inheritance or anything, but my grandmother was blessed with a long and relatively healthy life until my parents were nearly 80 years old, themselves.

What if the grandparents were in a car accident, one died and the other had traumatic brain injury and was in a nursing home for the rest of their life, decades?",

It isn't ridiculous to assume your own millionaire parents are gonna leave you a good chunk of that. He isn't just hoping for a miracle to save him, he 100% knows that his parents have millions and the most common thing by far is to let your children inherit that.

SOON.\n\nI meant ultimately you might be faced with supporting your father in his retirement, or see him in a very bad place.  I'm not making any judgement as to what you should do when that time comes, but your grandparents talking to your dad soon might lessen the hole he is digging for himself.",

My uncle wanted the lion's share (there were reasons), and my parents were having none of it. I was very unhappy with how things were going down in terms of people fighting and yelling. \n\nMy parents did not need the money. They tried to justify it and get me on board by saying that one day it'll be my money. I made it very clear that I don't want a penny of it if it means this rift with my extended family. But at the same time it certainly felt shitty that my uncle (a lawyer) was basically trying to strong arm my parents into giving in. Shitty situation all around.",

Change my mind. Granted, they *are* keeping it in the family but in this case, it sounds like the only thing their son did to piss them off was marry someone they don't approve of. Without further details explaining why they disapprove, that just isn't fair/justifiable. \n\nUltimately, they're free to give their estate to anyone they want, whether that makes them assholes or not. But they should at least tell him he's not going to be the one receiving it so he can KNOW he needs to fix his current destructive financial habits. And if they're not going to, you probably should. Why leave your father in the dark just to avoid drama? \n\n**ESH:**\n\n\\- Your grandparents suck for withholding money from their child and not telling him.\n\n\\- Your father sucks for making poor financial decisions in the assumption that it won't matter when his parents die.\n\n\\- You suck if you don't tell your father the truth (if you conclude that your grandparents will not tell him themselves).",

Your father's children - their grandchildren - will have to live with the stress of their father being over his head in debt, because your grandparents didn't want to face the conflict of actually communicating with their son.

I suspect we are probably talking between $1MM and $5MM in assets in OP's case. At this level, a trust may not be feasible and it's an amount of wealth that is really easy for an irresponsible person to burn through in a short period of time.  That amount of wealth can be incredibly impactful to the grandchildren and great grandchildren if managed responsibly.\n\nAs much as skipping my children would emotionally hurt them, letting their irresponsibility wipe out the opportunities I could give the grandchildren and their children is something I couldn't let happen.\n\nMy children are toddlers and I love them with all my heart.  But there does exist a scenario where I would do what the grandparents are doing here.  There is no scenario where I wouldn't tell everyone involved, but I would tell the grandchildren first before telling the children.\n\nFurther, if I believed that the expectation of inheritance triggered my children to live irresponsibly I would have to solve it by telling them they will not receive inheritance, even if that were untrue.

If he's been this careless with his savings, he probably wouldn't pay you back with a signed contract.\n\nI hope your grandparents are prepping you to handle the money and whatnot.\n\nGood luck!",

Let's do some 'math':\n\n1 - your father is spending beyond his means, and you know it\n\n2 - your father believes his spending will be back stopped by an inheritance, and you know it\n\n3 - if he got that inheritance, he'd be correct...  but you know he isn't\n\nYou're watching him destroy his financial life, are in a position to slow or stop that disaster, so yes, YWBTA if you didn't tell him he's operating off faulty information.\n\nYou don't mention any non-disclosure expectations above, so I'm forced to wonder what else is going on here that you wouldn't default to telling him he's running straight off a cliff.\n\nIt's not your job to change your grandparent's choice, you are perfectly fine, as far as I'm concerned, following their wishes in receiving the bulk of the estate and then not sharing it, but at the same time, you're still on the hook for knowing a bomb is about to go off and can do something about it... but just don't seem to want to do so.\n\nWhy ESH?  You seem perfectly fine letting your father destroy himself.  Your grandparents are cutting him off, and not telling him.  That's some passive aggressive bullshit, right there.  Your father is acting like a spoiled brat, spending money he doesn't have expecting mommy and daddy to make it better.",

They're his parents, they should have taught him how to manage money and set his future expectations properly if they're that wealthy.\n\nYour Father should not be spending money he doesn't have and banking on an inheritance he's not sure of but again his parents should have been honest about this inheritance from the start.\n\nAssuming you have a good relationship with your father you should tell him. I'm not sure why you would want to see your father fucked in the future because he's making a mistake you're watching happen. I'd rather lose my inheritance than see my dad's future fall apart but I may have a very different relationship with my dad than you do. If he's been a shit dad and the money's more important then maybe staying quiet is better. But if he's been a good parent then you should tell him. (edit: apparently he has not)\n\nEdit: I really don't get a lot of these n t a's. Would you guys really not tell your dad he's not getting the inheritance he's so certain of and planing his future around? Why would you agree to keep this a secret? It's only going to hurt him more.

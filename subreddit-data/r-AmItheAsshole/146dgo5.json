You're not.  In fact it means that other people can take advantage of you and you often end up doing stupid stuff like hanging on a girl in front of her BF.\n\n&gt; everyone was aware that i have no romantic intrest in the girl\n\nUh huh.

Then you got touchy-feely with his girlfriend, hugging her three times and touching her knee twice. Was it too much? Your judgment was impaired and you make no mention of how anyone including the girl felt about your touching. I'll defer to the sober and less emotional boyfriend that it was probably too much. Then you stomped out. Consider asking the lady whether your behavior made her night better or worse? Consider what corrections you could make to be a better guest to the boyfriend and friend to her in the future.",

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (f18) am prune to getting sick often and none of my family members really bat an eye when I do. It\u2019s nothing severe but I just have a weaker immune system and randomly get sick at least once a month. Most of the time I make jokes about getting sick often to my sister (f21) and my mom, however it\u2019s usually because I want them to actually care about my well-being rather than disregarding it as something everyone goes through. The problem was that I was talking to my sister about something random and I started to have another coughing fit, it suddenly turned to me rushing to the bathroom and puking my guts out. This is something that never happens and I was slightly worried if I had gotten sick again. When I came out of the bathroom the only thing my sister asked was \u2018did you wash your hands because I didn\u2019t hear it\u2019. I was already in a bad mood and that just annoyed me so I replied with, \u201cthanks for asking if I was okay,\u201d in a \u2018snarky\u2019 tone. My sister then stops and starts talking about what I said was very manipulative. She\u2019s said this before multiple times that I was manipulative when all I did was make snarky comments or ask for help implied through the things I\u2019ve said. She\u2019s made me feel like a horrible person for wanting someone to actually care about my health rather than sweep it under the rug as normal. Am I just blowing this small story up and it\u2019s a pointless post, or am I unintentionally being an asshole for being a snarky teenager?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It seems the mother isn't going to correct her perfect child, so he is only going to get worse. As someone else said, next time call her and then call the cops.",

I'm also under alot of stress, my oldest is unwell, but that's irrelevant here. Also on mobile. So there's a 6 year old boy in my neighborhood, parents don't watch him. He wanders around and rides his bike in the middle of the road. I have children of my own about the same age. He frequently let himself into my backyard, it's not fenced and that's on me, but I'm now putting one up for safety. Anyways this kid is clearly left alone quite a bit, he doesn't respond to authority and often threatens my younger children that he's \"going to tell his mom\" if they don't do what he says even though they've done nothing wrong, I assume it's just how he gets what he wants. My kids don't like confrontation. I have told my kids not to play with him and also told him politely a few times my kids cant play with him. I also texted the mom once asking if my kid was at their house because they left our yard against my wishes, again because he said he would tell his mom if they didnt follow him, but no one reaponded, i called and no answer. My kid did came home shortly after but still strange. So earlier today he came into my backyard again by himself and I told him nicely my kids couldn't play, he ignored me so I said he should be getting home now. He kept playing and only looked up to glare at me like I wasn't the boss of him so then I said if he didn't leave my property I would have to call the police. I didn't shout or curse, only raised my voice a little to make sure he could hear me. 5 minutes later his mother knocks on my door and starts yelling as soon as I open it, stepping so close its almost into my house. I ask her what going on and she shouts that I can't threaten her child and asked why I didn't want him over and I explained everything to her that I've mentioned here. So instead of being civil she says she can smell weed in my house so maybe she should call the police. No one in my house smokes so that was odd. She then asks why I let my child run loose, but then proceeds to say that her family has lived on this neighborhood for 20 years and it's fine that her son goes where he wants because it's \"his neighborhood\". I try to calm her down by stating I never threatened the boy and she replies that if I had a problem I should've called her instead of \"threatening\" her baby boy. I let her know I did infact try to get ahold of her before with no dice. She walks off and says clearly I need help and she feels sorry for me. She made me cry and feel like a piece of cr*p but maybe I deserved it I don't know\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

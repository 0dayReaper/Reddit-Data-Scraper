    "postText": "My partner (M40) and I (F35) live in a little house in the corner of a street.  My partner often works away and spends nights out of the house and I often work anti social hours so please don't think this is me being negative just about the anti social hours my neighbour keeps. \n\nWe park one vehicle on our front lawn, I am within my legal rights to use this as a space to park a vehicle and the only thing that has not been done is the actual tarmacing of the area.\n\nMy new neighbors have a large open backed van which is obviously for their work - they often come back late in the evening sometimes 10pm and often leave early in the morning (some mornings as early as 3.30) a few weeks ago they parked blocking our make shift additional drive and my partner went round and asked them not to they said they'd be gone early in the morning but my partner explained that we need to be able to access the space and that due to our work there was always a risk one of us would have to leave at an antisocial hour, although on that specific night it wasn't needed infact I didn't return home that night as got stuck at work.\n\nSince then although the neighbour has made sure not to block me in or out of the drive I am convinced they are being more anti social with the noise when using the vehicle at anti social times.  I always used to be mildly aware when the van was leaving it drives right past my house hard not to be at 3.30am but I've noticed more and more lots of opening and closing of doors on the vans, more loudness from driver and other passengers and more loading and unloading of the van at anti social hours.  \n\nToday it had been a bit warm so I had a window open even so I was awoken at 3.30am and the noise literally sounded like there was someone in my house (my partner is working away) I full on panicked and was grabbing my phone to call the police when I worked out what was going on the neighbour was walking around outside very stompily and repeatedly opening and closing the doors he by this point had the engine running, I lay back down but my heart was racing, I closed my window but they still idled outside for a further 10 minutes and there was further opening and closing of doors. \n\nWibta if I went round and said they are being unreasonable, they need to be better prepared and just get in their vehicle and go at those times. \n\nI am worried I would be the asshole as although when I leave at anti social times I can do so quietly. But their work is obviously very different (think social work versus builder)  and it might just be my own insecurities at being home alone causing the issue.",

You said they occasionally left at 3:30 am before the incident and that hasn't changed.  You said you were \"mildly aware\" before, so they were decently noisy even before the incident.\n\nAnd windows block out a good amount of sound, you clearing hearing noise shouldn't be a shock.",

If anything complaining about it would probably cause an escalation if they're actually already being vindictive. And if they're not being vindictive then they're just trying to get ready to leave for work, something nobody should be faulting them for.",

You have taken away a legal spot where they can park on the road.  \n\n\nSo first you tell them don't park there. Now you want to say don't make noise.  \nYou know what, if they were parked on the street, this noise probably wouldn't be under your bedroom window.",

No. \n\nSecond, youre conplaining that they leave early? If it truly was loud, maybe say something but given how you complained about them parking on the street, im doubting it.",

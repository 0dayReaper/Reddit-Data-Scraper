    "postText": "I had plans with some friends to go out for dinner last Friday night. However I had had a really mentally challenging day at work, and didn\u2019t have the mental capacity to socialize, so I told them that I wasn\u2019t feeling up to seeing people. They all said that was okay and they hope to see me next time. These are friends I see 2-3 times a month so it\u2019s not like I never see them.\n\nI went to the gym after work, hoping that would get me out of my head. My work provides a gym membership for all employees as long as we use a certain location so it\u2019s not uncommon to see my coworkers while I\u2019m there. While I was there I saw a work friend of mine I hadn\u2019t seen in a while. After we finished our workouts, she asked me to grab a bite. I was feeling more energized so I said sure. We just went to the subway next to the gym. I didn\u2019t realize my friend had tagged me in her instagram story, and one of my original friends saw the post. When they messaged me, I tried explaining that it wasn\u2019t planned, and that I went to the gym by myself, happened to see her and then we went to subway together before heading home. They\u2019re mad at me for doubling booking and then bailing on them. \n\nAITA?",

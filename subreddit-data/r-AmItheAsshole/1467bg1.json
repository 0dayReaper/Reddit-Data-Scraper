    "postText": "I am the middle child of 3 kids my older sister is 5 years older than me, we are almost the same height and we both have anxiety while my younger sister isn't related to us at all. Me and older sister live with are grandparents after some childhood problems with parents especially are mum. My older sister is a pain to deal with she thinks she can do anything she wants but can't, she whines all the time and complains about her body she is overweight, she compares her self to me all the time and over reacts to small things and acts like a child and she wastes her money. But I had it yesterday she was acting like a little kid and whining like usual I got extremely annoyed and blurted out something like this \"Just shut up you always act like a 7 year old and complain about everything you make it seem like I'm the older sister all the time even though I'm the younger than you and act way more mature than you\" she got extremely upset but spoke back \"You don't know what it's like to be me and yet you still yell at me after all I did for you your just ungrateful and you probably hope at I will disappear\" she  had tears coming from her eyes but I really couldn't have cared but I yelled back to her \"Well maybe you should grow up and act your fucking age you cunt\" this all happened in front are grandparents while my sister went down to are dad's house right after the argument. My dad and grandparents think I should apologise first so am I the asshole",

            "comment": "You should definitely apologize for calling her names (ad hominem attacks are always hurtful and never helpful). But you should also find a healthy way to express your feelings to her. Sounds like she has deep insecurities and needs therapy or some other help. Treat her with kindness rather than meanness and she\u2019ll be better positioned to heal. I think YTA for the language you used but your underlying feelings also deserve to be heard in a kind and constructive setting",

            "comment": "I don't think you are an intentional asshole. It seems like you were fed up. I do believe you were a bit harsh, tho. I can't blame you for it, tho as that's def frustrating to deal with. To me, it sounds like you guys have a bit of a rough life, and your sister so far seems  to have major insecurities and some bottled up issues of her own that she's not letting out in a healthy way. Honestly, ngl she sounds like how I used to be. I'd suggest just having a heart to heart with her. Explain your frustrations and feelings with her. You can tell her you're sorry for being too harsh, but you can't stand how she acts sometimes. Let her know you love her (I assume), but she needs to learn to love herself too instead of comparing and putting herself down all the time. Something along those lines. Overall, I don't feel like you're an asshole. Just someone who's fed up and exploded probably from bottling all those thoughts and feelings inside.",

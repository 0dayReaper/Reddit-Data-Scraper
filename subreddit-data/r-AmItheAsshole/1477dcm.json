    "postText": "My(32M) partner(27M) has been having financial troubles due to an addiction and recently had to sell his new car to a friend of his(30F). It was a regretful sale which he made obvious to the friend (who happens to be a psychologist). 2 months after the sale, and after he had distanced himself from her for a week or two because of other reasons too long to get into, she puts up a Facebook post with photos of the car and this message:\n\n\"Late post because I'm better at posting food then life events \ud83e\udd23 New car who dis? \ud83d\udc96 Meet my new partner on the road Bruce!\nZoom Zoom Forever \ud83e\udd70 \ud83d\ude99\"\n\nI saw this 3 days after she posted it and asked my partner why she was posting like that about something that would obviously upset him, which is when he told me he hadn't spoken to her recently and that she just does stuff like that when she's being ignored. Apparently she has some rule that friends need to talk to her at least once every 2 weeks?\n\nI asked him if he wanted me to call her out. He avoided answering twice, but when I said I was going to comment he told me to leave it alone and hung up on me. I do feel kinda assholey for ignoring his wishes, but this isn't the first time she's done stuff like this... I got the impression he'd like me to stick up for him but he's scared of the social ramifications.\n\nAnyway, I commented:\n\"&lt;Partner's name&gt;'s pretty gutted losing that car, idk why you'd post something like this where he can see it.\"\n\nShe didn't comment back, but 20m later she put up a new post of her dinner reading:\n\n\"7 Hour Slow Cooked Osso Bucco and Fondant Potatoes \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd70 Mmmmmmm the sauce from the slow cooking also made an amazing soup \ud83d\ude01 and the potato cuttings left over from making the Fondant Potatoes became a Bacon and Mushroom Potato Bake. It's been a cooking kinda day...\n\ud83d\ude02 It's been a delicious kinda day!\"\n\nAnd not long after she blocked me.\n\nAgain, she's a psychologist so I'm not buying any plausible deniability that she was unaware that she was being cruel, my partner has told me before that he takes a lot of her food posts as jabs directed at him. I usually avoid her like the plague and she's never been friendly towards me so I'm kinda relieved she's no longer on my friends list... But my partner is upset with me...\n\n\nAITA for calling out my partner's friend who was passively trying to upset him about a car he had to sell to her due to financial hardship?",

She's kinda known for being a bad cook, like literally too impatient to let a pan heat up to cook an expensive steak a guest had brought kinda deal, and my partner often makes really nice food at gatherings, but he doesn't post about it, other people post about it though.",

His perception that she's bullying him doesn't necessarily make it so. Everything you've mentioned is very circumstantial. She may have just waited 2 months to post about it because she wanted to give him time to adjust to not having the car anymore. She didn't have to keep a lid on it immediately or indefinitely unless she had agreed to do so, which from your comments, it doesn't sound like she did. \n\nPlus, it doesn't sound like the post was made with any ill intent, nor any of her food posts given the context we have. She doesn't talk about making food better than other people, or \"this is my friend's recipe and I made it better\" or something like \"oh my God look at my rainbow food #pride #ally.\"  She just... Talks about food that she's made that she thinks is good.\n\nThe only one that I think is even kinda suspect is the rainbow food one, and that's assuming that you're correct in that she doesn't have any other LGBT+ friends.",

More context: She didn't post about the last car she bought months back before this car. There is no doubt that she knew and intended for her post to hurt my partner. \"Zoom zoom forever\" is kinda nonsense since cars don't last forever, she's just trying to hammer it in that he won't ever get this car back, and the name she gave the car is coincidentally the same as my partner's ex.\n\nIf she was truly unaware of hurting her friend with her post, why didn't she take it down and message to say she hadn't realized she hurt him? Instead she saw my comment, posted about her dinner remarking \"\ud83d\ude02 it's been a delicious kinda day\" and then blocked me.\n\nShe does actually make friends recipes but swaps all the cheap ingredients for expensive ones and then posts about it. She does actually bang on about the rainbow stuff. I don't have access to her posts since I'm blocked now (only have access to the last few as I screenshoted them) so I can't give you much depth there sorry.",

She's a psychologist, this wasn't an accident. She can post what she wants, but my partner who knows her better than me agrees she was trying to hurt him with that post.\n\nBut yeah, I probably was the asshole for ignoring him.",

I doubt there would have been an \"appropriate\" time for her to post about it from either of your view points, but regardless of the time frame... why does your partner keep someone in their life if this person constantly hurts them? If this is a recurring problem, he needs to cut the friendship and let it go.",

It's not that the car appeared in the background. It's not that she went somewhere interesting and took a photo and btw new car... And she didn't do this previously with the other car she bought before this one. She did it when she's annoyed at being ignored.\n\nI'm not sure why he's still friends with her, as I said he's distanced himself and she's retaliating... Actually, that might be why, she won't let him go without upsetting him.",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy(32M) partner(27M) has been having financial troubles due to an addiction and recently had to sell his new car to a friend of his(30F). It was a regretful sale which he made obvious to the friend (who happens to be a psychologist). 2 months after the sale, and after he had distanced himself from her for a week or two because of other reasons too long to get into, she puts up a Facebook post with photos of the car and this message:\n\n\"Late post because I'm better at posting food then life events \ud83e\udd23 New car who dis? \ud83d\udc96 Meet my new partner on the road Bruce!\nZoom Zoom Forever \ud83e\udd70 \ud83d\ude99\"\n\nI saw this 3 days after she posted it and asked my partner why she was posting like that about something that would obviously upset him, which is when he told me he hadn't spoken to her recently and that she just does stuff like that when she's being ignored. Apparently she has some rule that friends need to talk to her at least once every 2 weeks?\n\nI asked him if he wanted me to call her out. He avoided answering twice, but when I said I was going to comment he told me to leave it alone and hung up on me. I do feel kinda assholey for ignoring his wishes, but this isn't the first time she's done stuff like this... I got the impression he'd like me to stick up for him but he's scared of the social ramifications.\n\nAnyway, I commented:\n\"&lt;Partner's name&gt;'s pretty gutted losing that car, idk why you'd post something like this where he can see it.\"\n\nShe didn't comment back, but 20m later she put up a new post of her dinner reading:\n\n\"7 Hour Slow Cooked Osso Bucco and Fondant Potatoes \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd70 Mmmmmmm the sauce from the slow cooking also made an amazing soup \ud83d\ude01 and the potato cuttings left over from making the Fondant Potatoes became a Bacon and Mushroom Potato Bake. It's been a cooking kinda day...\n\ud83d\ude02 It's been a delicious kinda day!\"\n\nAnd not long after she blocked me.\n\nAgain, she's a psychologist so I'm not buying any plausible deniability that she was unaware that she was being cruel, my partner has told me before that he takes a lot of her food posts as jabs directed at him. I usually avoid her like the plague and she's never been friendly towards me so I'm kinda relieved she's no longer on my friends list... But my partner is upset with me...\n\n\nAITA for calling out my partner's friend who was passively trying to upset him about a car he had to sell to her due to financial hardship?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "postText": "I recently won a \u2018fuck you\u2019 amount of money. I won\u2019t say exactly how much but it\u2019s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It\u2019s enough to change the life of myself and my family. \n\nMy ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. \n\nShe was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She\u2019s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I\u2019m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven\u2019t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. \n\nLong story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I\u2019m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I\u2019m not *in* love with her. We\u2019ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I\u2019m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don\u2019t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?\n",

            "comment": "NTA if you intended for the money to help out her and your kids. If you only intended to give it to her because you 'love' your ex wife then you're a bit of an asshole (ESH) for making your current girlfriend a 'plan b'. The way she reacted was a little over the top, but to be expected since you are giving money to another woman (that you used to be married to).\n\nOtherwise, you do have kids to provide for and it's none of her business because you're not married and you don't share the money.\n\nJust a question: did she know you had a wife when you had an affair with her? Because if she did then the whole 'disrespecting her' is a load of bullshit because she did the same thing to your ex wife.\n\nedit: wow this blew up\n\nEdit 2: is this what it's like when people hijack the top comment \n\nEdit 3: thanks for the silver, guy",

I agree that her claiming disrespect is bullshit because we both engaged in very disrespectful behaviour towards my ex wife.\n\nThe money is being given with the full intention that ex wife did me right over these years and I want to do right by her too. She\u2019s the mother of my kids and she also deserves a good life. I also want the kids to grow up in 2 wonderful environments instead of dad having a \u2018nice\u2019 place and moms place being comparatively bereft. I don\u2019t think that would be fair. ",

He had had an affair, divorced their mom and married the woman who he had an affair with, and bought a luxury apartment for him, that woman and the woman's child from her first marriage (guess who was also married during that affair). Meanwhile he refused to pay child support 'because it was hard enough raising his step-child' and the mother of my friends didn't drag him to court over it because she has always been too nice. She and my friends then lived in a rundown apartment from state welfare. I remember my friends always wearing hand-me-downs and only having used and super old stuff. We lived in a city where you go everywhere by bike but they only had their old children's bikes that were way too small for them. They had to share a bedroom with bunk beds until they were 18. \nAfter a few years, the father's new wife left him and suddenly he offered my friends to leave their mother and live with him in his luxury apartment. They didn't take him up on it but they got a key so they could sometimes housesit. When I saw the apartment from the inside for the first time I remember being so angry at their father that I started crying. Everything was so beautiful and the stepchild actually had a room that was twice as big as the twins' shared room, stuffed with brand-new toys and furniture and everything. ",

That hes talking about her respectfully instead of coming up with nasty names for the ex is ANOTHER big deal!\n\nWe don't know the reason of the cheating, that could be a messy AITA post in itself.

Judging by that part alone, hes doing pretty well.\n\nAnd I'm saying all of this as a woman that's been cheated on twice!

The girlfriend has every right to be insecure about this, but I think she needs to reconsider these feelings she's having and recognize that he's doing this because he loves his kids. Additionally her actions seem shady if OP is to be believed in his other comments- he mentions that she's been holding back the progress of the relationship for 6 years. I wouldn't be surprised if the thrill of the chase has worn out for her and she's already found a new person to pursue, married or otherwise. But that's me jumping to near-baseless conclusions, and I'll try not to insinuate any further.",

Your wife per your own words is a good person, and as far as I understand didn't ASK for anything after she learned you won it. (I have a feeling if we switch the women the current GF would be pissed if you didn't give her half or more, even if she was your ex wife)  \n\n\nYour ex is also the mother of your children, the money won't just be for her, it will be for their futures as well, College funds etc.\n\n  \nJust don't go nuts spending money and continue working, but less hours and with something you really enjoy.\n\nSpend it wisely, far too many winners end up in bankruptcy because they rack up bills they then cannot sustain",

It\u2019s 100% possible OP just means super well...but it\u2019s also possible that, after triangulating the wife and girlfriend during the affair, he\u2019s now triangulating the girlfriend against the wife.  \n\nWhen my ex\u2019s affair came out, I frequently found myself in bizarre scenarios of her literally confronting me and yelling at me (the affair partner!  Confronting and yelling at the \u201cwronged\u201d ex!  It was bizarre).  Turns out a lot of those scenarios were \u201cengineered\u201d by him, playing on her insecurities and trying to basically pit us against each other.  It only stopped when I intentionally moved 9 hours away and cut off all non-emergency contact (since we do have a kid together, so couldn\u2019t cut off completely).  My ex is def the type to start a fight with his girlfriend by being overly generous to his ex-wife and co-parent (which, as Im completely uninterested in reconciling, doesn\u2019t really bother me...but it\u2019s something I\u2019m aware of when he does these \u201cgood guy\u201d gestures).  \n\nTLDR: Humans are extremely complicated, and even generous gestures can have hidden motives sometimes.\n\nEDIT: to restate, I believe it\u2019s definitely possible that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here.  But I\u2019m surprised, on a sub where people so frequently say it\u2019s hard to judge based on a single subjective perspective, that people seem eager to accept OPs story 100% at face value.",

One of his favorite games was to put you in a situation that felt deeply unfair but made you look crazy for complaining (heck, when get got his affair partner a job at his office before the affair came out, he knew I was deeply uncomfortable but I accepted it because he explained how it was her only way of being independent to escape her awful abusive marriage.  What monster could say no to that, especially after being assured she was def just a friend in need?).\n\nYes, I fully admit to being kind of jaded, lol, but I earned it legitimately.

While she's wrong to resent you giving money to the mother of your children, the way you talk *does* sound like you're still in love with your ex-wife, and that you consider cheating with your current GF as the biggest mistake of your life. Just by the way you write, it sounds like you (rightly) accept that what you did was wrong, but also that you believe you would have been happier if you'd never met your gf.\n\n\n\nIf I've picked up on this, (and assuming I'm not a million miles off the mark), it's reasonable to assume your gf has too, which may explain her reaction.\n\n\nYou were wrong to string her along for this long, especially as you now seem to feel happy she's talking about ending it. You should have broken up with her a long time ago, it seems.\n",

But one facet of life that I never hear people talk about is that the further along you get in life, you're always going to have attachments to people. Going to be attracted to people. And none of that has to interfere with your actual life. You can be attracted to people and not cheat on your partner. You can have feelings for someone and not act on them. People sometimes tend to try to act like when you are with them, everything else about you has to wither and die and it's just not true. Adults can separate right from wrong. This guy hurt a wife that he loved being an idiot and he owns it. He knows they aren't gonna get back together and that he made a mistake. He can still have feelings for her and move on with his life. In real life you don't extinguish your feelings towards other people just bc your life pushed you in another direction. And in my experience, when you try to push two people apart, you generally end up pushing them together.",

My ex and I divorced 10 years ago because I had an emotional affair. No kids but we were together for 13 years. After I stayed with the emotional affair for five years. \n\nHuge mistake, but I recognize that I stayed with him for so long because I had to make it work. I had to make it work because I felt I lost the love of my life over a dumb mistake. I couldn't face it.  To be fair my ex and I had grown apart, but we had an amicable divorce and we never fought as a couple. Perhaps 4 times in 13 years. \n\nFor so long I missed my ex and thought everything would be better with him. Finally, I left the affair. My question for you is, is there a part of you that is hoping to get back with your wife? I may be projecting but I hear it. If there is, and it is strong, you need to end it with the gf. You may not get your wife back but she (gf) deserves to move on. ",

The whole \"but not in love\" seems weird too. \n\nSounds like OP cheated on his wife and every since feel guilty about it and the gf is paying for it.

A lot of people in this thread seem to be getting all uplifted that a father wants to provide for his children and absolving him of his general assholeness. \n  \nIt is such a basic, moral demand to provide for your children. In my book, he gets no points for doing that. It's a requirement and if you don't do that, you suck (unless you're literally unable to, which is not what's going on here). Sometimes providing for your children means the other parent benefits - be it a house, new car, or just general financial security. But this guy SEEMS to not be thinking strictly in that sense. He wants to provide for his ex because he still loves her. And that's why I feel for his current \"gf\". She's right to feel jealous and upset. This guy sucks and he sucked since he cheated. He will provide for his kids, but that is a basic moral demand, so he isn't redeemed by getting a large windfall that will benefit his kids. It just further shows that he's a bad romantic partner. ",

It isn't surprising to me that your gf would act in this way. Obviously, anyone who engages in an affair is a selfish person, so you shouldn't be surprised. But your ex and your kids deserve the world, and if you can help provide that, you absolutely should. It seems like you have been together with your gf for awhile, but it would also seem that relationships that start with affairs aren't long lasting. Your ex seems like a kind and reasonable person, and I would bet she would be open to this money going into some sort of fund for your children. So that could be a solution if you have any desire to appease your gf and salvage that. And if gf still has a problem, well then, you have some bigger decisions to make about that relationship. ",

While I don\u2019t like that your GF doesn\u2019t want you to give Ex-Wife any money, I\u2019m not surprised by her insecurity about it and about how you still feel about Ex-Wife.

The fact that you called your wife FIRST outside of parents is terrible for your GF to know. I wouldn't want to date someone that did that to me. I'm not their first priority past parents and kids.\n\nOn top of that nowhere in the post do you mention the epic trip you'll take her to or how you will help your GF. Sure you made a \"mistake\" with her and got a divorce but this woman has supported you in the lowest point of your life. That's huge, man.\n\nIn addition She is reacting harshly. No need to put ultimatums or talk roughly. If I were her, I'd just walk away. \n\nIf the money was two college funds and a paid out for 5 years babysitter - that'd be fair. Or even pay the mortgage on the ex-wife's house for 6 months kind of thing. But just giving an ex partner $1-4 Mill is a lot. \n\nIt does show you care. But it also shows you value your ex wife's needs above your current partner. That's terrible for her.\n\nPersonally I think for your selfish benefit - you should rekindle things with your ex-wife. She still loves you and for the kids it would be great. I would give some to the GF as a parting gift.\n\nEDIT: Just found out he dated the GF for SIX YEARS? Jesus I feel sorry for her. Break Up with her and at least pay her something for wasting 6 years while being in love with your wife.",

I think it's beautiful that you feel this towards your ex-wife.\n\nNo matter what, your kids will always look at theway that their parents treat each other and learn from it. You were once married to her, just because you're divorced (admitted by your fault being in a low place) it doesn't make the other person the enemy. Humans can't just switch feelings off and that's nature.\n\nThe fact that your current gf is getting angry about it is not cool, you say it's a big number so there's enough to go around without you being out of pocket. You are not only supporting your kids, but also the caregiver to your kids which is a lovely thing to do. \n\nBe the better person that you (sound like) you want to be. It's your money, your kids and like it or not your lifelong friend whose probably seen and helped you at your best and worst in the past",

I think your current partner is being a bitch and honestly it sounds to me like you'd be better off without her. You are in no way an asshole for wanting to make sure your ex and kids are comfortable. And congrats on the win dude. Enjoy it. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nEdited to add: your current partner should want your kids to have a great home life as well. Not just when they're with you. ",

I was terrified when my affair was discovered because I thought my kids. Who are literally the best thing that ever happened to me, would be alienated from me. Ex wife never ever made them feel like I didn\u2019t love them even though arguably they are the ones who got hurt the most from this. I\u2019ll never forget that kindness. ",

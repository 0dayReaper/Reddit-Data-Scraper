    "postText": "I (21F) live in a 2 bedroom apartment with 4 other people, 3 (including me) in one room and 2 in the other (who I'll call Fred and Bill). All of us are university students.\n\nAt the end of every semester, I like to host a small get-together to celebrate the end of finals. By \"small,\" I usually mean anyone living with me in the apartment/dorm (I lived on-campus in the dorms last year) who wants to join in plus around 3-4 guests maximum from outside the apartment. Usually, that's around 8-10 people total (it only reached 10 last year because I lived with 7 other people in the dorm). I've done this every semester for the past two years, so my current suitemates are used to the situation (they've also joined in every other time). We've never gotten a noise complaint. Basically, I'm trying to emphasize that I'm not hosting some wild, frat-style party.\n\nThe problem is that there was a falling out about a week ago because of some boundary issues and now my two roommates and I aren't speaking to Bill right now. We're still friends with Fred, he just chose to stay out of it cause he lives with Bill. For the get-together, I've invited everyone living in the apartment except Bill. If we hadn't had the falling-out, I would've invited Bill too.\n\nNo one else can host. I'm wondering if it'd be weird to continue hosting because literally everyone except Bill in the apartment is invited. I don't think it's fair for me to have to adjust my plans because he decided to wake up last week and be an ass, but I also think it would be mean to exclude him so hard to his face because he'd essentially be stuck in his room alone all night.\n\nEDIT: It'd be 8 people this time around, the 4 of us living here and 4 guests.\n\nEDIT 2: I've decided to keep the get-together contained to my own room since that seems to be the main AH problem. Would that solve it, or would I still be TA because he would know that we're all hanging out without him?",

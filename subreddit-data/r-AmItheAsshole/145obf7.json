    "postText": "I stopped my parents house and decided to cook for my dad while we watch the NBA Finals.\n\nGot a new B\u00e9arnaise sauce recipe and was really excited to make it with some chicken.\n\nWe season the chicken breast together (same old salt, pepper, etc.) and fry it in a pan as I\u2019m preparing the sauce in another pot.\n\nChickens about to be finished when my dad said he doesn\u2019t want the chicken to burn at the bottom of the pan so he wants to add a soy sauce base or something so that the chicken will soak it up and not burn at the bottom.\n\nI\u2019m totally confused as to why we need to do this. The chicken is done, we could just put it on a plate and wait 5 mins while the B\u00e9arnaise sauce is almost ready.\n\nI ask him why does he need to add a base? I tell him I want him to try the sauce first. \n\nHe seems dead set on it and I remove my pieces of chicken and let him add his base.\n\nAt that point I\u2019m pissed and get quiet. He can visually see me become mad. I come cook for you and am super excited to have you try a new recipe without it being messed with.\n\nFoods all ready and I apply the B\u00e9arnaise sauce on top of my chicken and my dad asks for some. I refuse.\n\nI said you didn\u2019t seem interested in trying it all since you made your own sauce, so you can just add more soy sauce if you want.\n\nHe says he was worried that the B\u00e9arnaise sauce would be too bland, and that he just want to prevent that.\n\nI refuse to give him the B\u00e9arnaise sauce, and I place it on the oven as I sit down and eat.\n\nHe can go grab it, that\u2019s fine, but I won\u2019t serve it to him. He knows I\u2019m mad, he knows there\u2019s tension in the room. He doesn\u2019t go for the sauce and just eats his chicken as is.\n\nNo talking commences, we\u2019re just eating and watching the game.\n\nMy feeling is why doesn\u2019t he trust me? Why is he so controlling? He knows I\u2019m excited to cook for him, why does he always have to alter or \u201cfix\u201d my cooking, shit, everything else I do.\n\nAITA for declining to give my dad any B\u00e9arnaise sauce?",

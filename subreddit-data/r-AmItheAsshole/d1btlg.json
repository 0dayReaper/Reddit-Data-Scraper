And don't be afraid to tell your dad what you need, which is his undivided attention for a minute! If you're in school, talk to a counselor or teacher, or ask to be referred to therapy. \n\nYou have a real asset in your grandma. Call her and talk with her often. She may be a good way to get through to your dad. \n\nHang in there. I'm sorry life is tough right now.",

The stepmom likely didn\u2019t choose to have a disabled child, but she chose to have a child (ignoring the fucked up societal issues around motherhood not always being a choice). The father chose to marry someone with a severely disabled child, ignoring the impact if would have on his own daughter, who had no say in this. \n\nI understand the adult perspectives, I just think that line of thinking is rather flawed. They see how \u201cmean\u201d and lacking in empathy the daughter (OP) is, ignoring that OP has lost her own mom in a traumatic way and has her own needs. Those needs are so far on the back burner it might as well not even be on the stove at all. \n\nTeenagers sound \u201centitled\u201d, but it\u2019s just the inability to express their feelings beyond their limited emotional vocabulary and communicate them in a way their parents (and others) can understand. It\u2019s normal child behavior, yet the more a parent reacts in disgust or ignores their child needs, the worse/wider that chasm in their relationship gets. Parents feel like they can let off knee-jerk reactions without probing (by asking questions or reflecting about themselves/their parenting/their child\u2019s needs). \n\nThe kid says she wants to go hang out with her friends, not feed her sister. The parents react with disgust at this want, because it looks like their kids value seeing friends over helping her step sister continue to live. But really what OP is saying is \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been abandoned by my parents when they picked the needs of another child over my own, and I need to go be in a space where people love me for me, not see me as useful in caring for the needs of a very needy individual. My parent has already indicated this child\u2019s needs are more important than my own, which makes me feel guilty and resentful at the same time as feeling unloved and not the child they *really* care about - my needs do not come first\u201d it doesn\u2019t matter how needy her stepsister is, that just makes OP feel worse and guilty for having her own wants and needs, and that they have clearly chosen the other child over her.\n\n(Edit: y\u2019all are sweet, but please, stop giving me gold or platinum or whatever. Donate it or give it to someone who is struggling to make ends meet, please. I mean, it\u2019s your money, but, like, this is absurd.)\n\n(Edit: everyone commenting on my comment has made my shitty day shine. Thank you.)",

They like to talk about \"how they used to do things\" but forget they had parents there for them, unlike OP here.\n\nYou mentioned \"adult logic\" and I think that's what the problem here is. They don't see OP as a growing child they still need to care for, but another set of hands for someone they deem \"more urgent\" to care for. That always seems to happen. You were spot on about the \"I didn't ask for this\" part\", because the Dad literally asked for it by marrying her, and the Stepmom could always, as awful as it sounds, have given her child to other places that could care for her. They exist. Both of them had options. Really, the only person justified in saying they didn't ask for anything **is OP**.\n\nI'd suggest talking to your dad, OP. Tell him what most people here are suggesting about explaining how you truly feel, and how you truly feel about your stepsister (and hospitals). Most times,  adults come off as jerks because they just don't have the information you assume they have. If they really aren't jerks, they'll change after you inform them. If not, well, you still have your grandma. And only 3 more years.\n\nJust remember though, they most likely aren't having a great time either. They may try to use that as a reasoning point, but they shouldn't use it as a reason to have you join in their suffering. Just doesn't make any sense. I'd understand if your stepsister was your actual sister, but you're technically right that these people are basically strangers you suddenly have to live with. Kinda upsetting your dad doesn't get that.",

His wife's daughter is dying, but at the same time should *not* be forcing care of the daughter on her as well. He needs to learn boundaries, but I was also changing bed pans and wrappings for my grandfather's cancer death along with the home health aide, my mom and aunt. I was 20, still i see that 5 years older is quite a difference of age compared to 35 to 40, and shouldn't be forced unless she wanted to. Maybe he feels desperate and feels he wants to have everyone do the best they can for maximum comfort and care of the daughter to extend her life. Taking care of a special needs child is so taxing on a person, someone can't imagine what it takes to care for someone day in and day out, constantly worrying if this is the last day she'll be able to breathe for herself, for years and years, hell she already can't feed herself. It's a tough situation all around and everyone is stressed, but at the end of the day OP is NTA, dad is kinda the asshole for forcing care on the daughter when she doesn't want to and needs to learn and process emotions and communicate better, which will lead to boundaries. Op you're strong, youre dad understands and also wants to help his wife, the person he married and loves the best he can in a very hard situation. I feel for you all, I'm sure your dad is hurting inside he can't effectively talk to you as well. The step mom thing is another issue in of itself because it's not her burden to force onto you, that was your dad's choice to take upon himself  by marrying her. Their being upset about op not getting her things is kinda shitty on their part entirely though I want to say. I guess I can see where they're coming from if theyre financially stressed, as most people who take care of medically needy special needs kids are, about getting a few things, but with limited funds anyways and being that age, where's the room for personal gain and enjoyment, I think I understand with that said. So all in all, OP NTA.",

I also am about to remarry, but he has no children of his own. What your parents are doing is not fair. They should never expect you to care for your step sister. They are hoisting responsibility on you that you should never have to shoulder. It isn't your job to be her caretaker. You are a kid yourself. You are not required to go to the hospital and you shouldn't have to if you dont want to. I understand your resentment towards your step-sister though I will say it is misguided. She didnt ask for this life and I know you know that. I'm not scolding you. Your feelings are 100% valid. Your parents should be understanding and not casting you to the side for your step sister while asking you to give up your life to aid in her care. Honestly, I dont even expect anything from my SO in my daughter's care as he is not her biological father. If he wants to learn, then awesome! If he isnt comfortable, no problem. That's how your step mom should be and your dad if he's okay with the care of your step sister. NONE of this was your choice like your father. I'm so sorry this is happening to you. It is not fair to you at all. You are NTA in any way shape or form. \n\nI know you wont be able to get through to your parents, but do you have another adult in your life on your side that could confront them for you? Having adults on your side can go a lot further than just the \"unruly teen acting out\". I was that teenager so I understand. \n\nPlease message me if you need someone to talk to.",

One of them has a pretty severe disability and she makes her emotional needs are met too. Got her a big sis which has made a really positive impact.  They go out for special one on one \"dates.\" It's not rocket science to help BOTH of your kids have a healthy home life. \n\nYour dad and step mom need to be considerate of how the family dynamics impact your life and your feelings.

The latter that has become so popular in internet spaces basically says \"your feels shape reality\" and that's dangerous and immature.\n\nFirst, the important answer:\n\nNTA it was the father and stepmothers job to merge the families in a way that makes everyone feel welcome and appreciated and they failed at that.\n\nThey can't just confront a teen with a special needs person who is even older than them and expect that teen to feel love and be excited to be a caretaker by selling feeding etc as a bonding experience. Not cool, not okay.\n\nNow, OP is also uncomfortable in hospitals. The parents would have a point if it was a person OP cares for. If it was a friend or a relative OP really liked and they were really sick, I wouldn't hesitate to pull the \"you might regret it if they don't come back alive\" card. Not for emotional manipulation but to show a possible consequence of their decision. Fifteen minutes of discomfort are not worse than regretting to not see someone you like for the last time, that's just life experience.\n\nHowever, OP has no bond with this person. Not friendly, not sisterly, they barely know them, not just because there's not much to know but because the stepsister has only been in OP's life for a few months. She's a stranger and even if OP felt indifferent about her, visiting her would neither do OP nor the sister favor. It's just for the comfort of the parents who are experiencing a tough time and would probably feel a bit better about themselves if given the illusion of being a healthy family (and consequently, not having to face the fact they screwed up by forcing too much on OP too quickly).\n\nNow back to the \"emotions are valid uwu\" bs. \n\nThis bugs me so much. \"You're sooo valid, nobody must ever tell you you're wrong\", seriously. It's bullshit. The whole point of the exercise is to examine your emotions and to name them for what they are. \n\n\"Do I really hate her?\" might be \"Yes, I do\", might also be, after some self-reflecting, \"actually, I feel indifferent about her, I also don't hate my dad or stepmom but I hate how they treat me and how I'm forced to act as a happy sister to someone I barely know and I hate how they expect me to pretend I enjoy feeding this stranger more than meeting my friends.\"\n\nFrom there, the second step would be - given what I know about the situation, the whole facts, is what I feel and how intensely I feel appropriate in relation to the issue? \n\nThe answer for \"yes, I hate her\" would, if tackled honestly, most likely lead to a variation of the second answer. And with that answer, you have new facts that you can tackle. That you can try to find solutions for, like talking to the dad, stepmother, grandma, or a counselor at school.\n\nTHAT'S how \"emotions are valid\" is supposed to work. Sitting there and stewing in negative emotions is not ever helpful if done for longer than a day. After getting the first round of frustration and anger out of a system (generally speaking now) it is important to bring some reality into the situation. Unless you think long-term solutions and actual improvement of a situation or relationships just doesn't give the right vibe for motivational tumblr posts, then you can, of course, stick to your short-term \"uwu your feelings are never wrong or to be criticised\" mantra.",

I think we all knew you weren't describing her in a negative way, but then we also have to remember the context, too. It's a harsh, unforgiving sort of description if you're just unaware of that lifestyle to begin with. People can exist without any outside signs of life, but that's not to say it's any measurable amount of rewarding living.\n\nI hope you find some good friends and that you keep on growing and learning so that you can one day be happier!

Parents buy gifts from their kids all the time, a small kid may help chose something for their friend/sibling, but more often than not (in my experience) the parent both pick it out and buy it themselves. If step-mum want her kid to get a gift OP should get a gift from step-sister too, even if step-mum is the one who has to pick it out.\n\nWhat gifts can you even give someone like step-sister? I don't mean to be harsh, but being \"not there\" can mean so many things, and being physically frail with fragile bones and epilepsy also limit what she can safely use. Does she play with toys, or does she just sit there uninterested in everything? Does she require expensive specialty equipment? If it is either of the latter two, what could OP even give her that step-sis could and would actually use? ... Does step-sister even react to being celebrated (aka is it actually for the sister and not just what mum wants)?\n\nI feel like the answer to these really show is step-mum is even trying to keep things balanced between them or just wants to play house with her daughter.",

You can't treat your children as if their emotions and needs don't matter, then expect to have a good relationship with them. Dad is an asshole, however well-meaning he is toward his new step-daughter.\n\nEdited to add: NTA",

My brother and I are pretty close and we never buy gifts for each other except at Christmas because we are both young (20s) and broke. We spend time together on birthdays instead. \n\nI can\u2019t stand parents who pressure their kids in spending their money on things like gifts for their siblings (parents should buy a gift and say it\u2019s from the whole family, they\u2019re the ones making money) and they shouldn\u2019t be buying birthday gifts for your parents either. My mom even told us to stop buying her cards cause they\u2019re a waste of money",

It\u2019s not your role to be their support system (although in a healthy dynamic this will shift as you get older). \n\nAs far as how you feel about your stepsister- I completely understand why you haven\u2019t formed a bond with her and feel like you can\u2019t. It\u2019s completely reasonable. I do think you should find a different way to verbalize it- saying you have no bond with her is different than saying she\u2019s just nothing and it\u2019s less offensive to people.",

I believe you\u2019re processing a lot of outside stress from a tough situation your family is projecting on you.\n\nIn another post you mentioned being able to openly communicate with your grandmother. I would say all of this to her. Hopefully she can help you relay this to your family is a way that they understand.\n\nIf you\u2019re not comfortable with that, my therapist always suggests to me to write an honest letter. I wouldn\u2019t include hurtful or insensitive things regarding your step sister, but I would keep it very focused on how their pressure affects you and your ability to develop. You are their child too.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you have to go through all of this but I wish you the best. Good luck.",

You've actually grown up by forming your own ideas and opinions, but your dad still interprets your opinions and ideas as tantrums or childishness.  So instead of considering your stance, he says he doesn't have energy to badger you until agreement.  So common even later in life. Someone says \"you don't listen\" when they mean \"you don't agree!\"  It's a tough spot no matter what going on, but even worse now.  \n   \nWatch for common mistakes like this so you can better assert yourself.  And keep a few retorts in your back pocket...\n   \n\"I can understand and still disagree.\"\n    \n\"I hear you saying (rephrase what he said) and what I'm saying is (response).\"\n   \nTry to say \"yes, and\" when you mean \"but.\" \n   \nLike, Dad:\"you should want to be there for family!!!\" \"Yes and I haven't come to see her as my family because of how quickly she was forced into my life.\" \n   \nIt stops the argument from escalating just by changing 1 word, even though you said the same thing. \n   \n\"You're killing your stepmom by acting this way!\" \"Yes and that's unfortunate, but I'm putting my own health first this time.\"",

It's not unheard of for a parent who has lost their spouse to begin to rely on their child for emotional support, especially if it's a child of the opposite sex. He's probably doing it unconsciously and just expected that she would pick up the \"mothering\" slack in this situation as well. The stepmother also asked OP to use her birthday money to buy her stepsister a gift, so obviously endorses the view that OP is essentially a servant. There is lots of research on this if you look up terms like \"parentification\" or \"enmeshment\".\n\nThere are also lots of heartbreaking stories of children who were neglected because they have severely disabled siblings and the family had little resources. I used to work with autistic teenagers at a summer school where I witnessed it first hand. An 8 year old girl came in wih her parents and all of them had scars on their arms where the older, non verbal, sister had bitten them.",

When you visit her, hold her hand for like a few minutes and tell her that everything will be alright. I'm telling you this because I believe that if she does die, you will be unable to forgive yourself for this part and this may haunt you forever.\n\nOn the other hand, no matter the circumstances, you are not obligated to care for her. You shouldn't be forced to feed her or stay at home to take care of her. That's your parents job.\n\nYou may believe that she is a potatoe, but she could still have feelings, you know. So give her a present on christmas and birthdays. And ask your father for money. Maybe give her something with less functional but more sentimental value. Maybe a picture of your entire family (stepsis, stepmom, dad, you). Or maybe make some pudding if she can eat that.\n\nAs for my vote, I think this is either NTA or NAH. Having a potatoe daughter is a lot of effort and if you feel neglected, tell your parents (both dad and step mom). If they proceee to make fun or ignore your needs, at least you will have clarity in understanding on how little they value you. If they however are understanding and cooperative, it may turn your relationship for the better\n\nEdit: also get rid of that hatred while you can. Hate is the most disgusting thing in the world. And I'm not talking about how others view you. I'm talking about what it will do to yourself. Hatred will swallow your soul. You will sooner or later start loathing yourself and eventually you... As someone who is full of hatred, I promise you, you will regret hating in a few years. It's torture",

Having a disabled family member puts a strain on everyone in the household, yes, but they're still your family. \n\nGo to the hospital. I'll let you in on a secret, everyone hates hospitals. Hospitals are not for good memories.  You go because the sense of discomfort you feel should be pushed aside to support your family in their time of need. I know it's hard but it's important.

There is no reason this kid should have to visit that vegetable in the hospital, only to make herself feel worse and her stepmom and dad feel better.

Just shows rampant immaturity.\n\nThe ONLY way I wouldn\u2019t go visit someone dying in a hospital if I was asked to is if I hated someone. And I mean like ACTUALLY hated, like they stabbed a family member and went to jail for years and years level hated. When people are dying and you\u2019re not able to drop whatever trivial thing you\u2019re mad about them for, that speaks way more volumes about YOU than anything else.\n\n****************************************************************************************************\n\nReplying to your comment @bubblegrubs :\n\n&gt; Wow you're so emotionally mature compared to a 15 year old who lost their mother and has an emotionally unavailable father, good for you. I'm sure I have an ''I'm stronger than a troubled teen with piles of non-standard responsibilites'' medal somewhere... how about we add each other to our friends lists and I'll mail it to you once I find it, k?\n\nHa ha, you're so funny. I never claimed to be more emotionally mature than when I was 15. We're all fucking retarded when we're 15, your brain literally works different when you're a teenager. And that's exactly why we need to hear the step-mom and dad's sides of the story. It could be totally different than what OP is telling us.\n\n****************************************************************************************************\n\nReplying to your comment @skillet06g :\n\n&gt; YTA u/ruffsnap for forcing your beliefs. Consider OP's feelings too.\n\nI don't get why so many of you keep jumping to that conclusion, considering I have NOT said what you're trying to say I said. Of COURSE OP's feelings are valid. I'm not saying AT ALL that just because they're 15 they don't have valid feelings. But we need to hear the step-mom and dad's sides of the story as well. Also, I'm not \"forcing beliefs\" at all, I'm trying to educate a lot of you who don't sound like you've been through situations like OP's, or just maybe you're teenagers as well.\n\n****************************************************************************************************\n\nReplying to your comment @SrUnOwEtO :\n\n&gt; Adult here: Why? Moral responsibility? Step sister isn't going to know if she went or not.\n\nAre you kidding me? You really have that awful of a mindset? C'mon, you can't really. Do you think family members of people in vegetative states should all just give up and not visit their loved ones?\n\n&gt; What, is she gonna provide more help and care than the step mom and dad and the hospital staff? Is her sister going to pass unless OP goes to the hospital?\n\nJesus you're cynical and negative. Are you really unable to see the value in visiting a fucking loved one in a hospital? It's OBVIOUSLY (or should be) not about level of care or whatever nonsense you're trying to say.\n\n&gt; Yeah. OP is a teenager and upset for being neglected by her father after their mother DIED IN A HOSPITAL.\n\nHow is OP being neglected by their father? It sounds to me like OP is just having difficulties accepting a new step-family as their family, which basically ALL people go through who gain a step-family. It takes a bit for everyone to warm up to each other. You're trying to use OP's mother dying in a hospital as leverage, but it does not work in that way, trust me.\n\n&gt; Of course no one LIKES hospitals. If step sister was able to be more aware and realized and knew OP didn't care for her and didn't go, OP would maybe be an asshole.\n\nThe step-sister's level of awareness has NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING. It's a family member in a hospital, period. You're being borderline offensive to people with disabilities, and you should stop that.\n\n****************************************************************************************************\n\nReplying to your comment @Velvetandiron :\n\n&gt; Honesty, most of the NTA advice OP is getting in this thread sounds like it\u2019s coming from adults who were once parentified children.\n\nI don't think that's the case at all. I don't see OP as having to be a parent at all. He has a step-sister now that needs more attention, and he's feeling hurt because attention is having to be split between him and the step-sister. He's feeling resentment. That's totally normal when you gain step-family, and takes a bit to get over.\n\n&gt; The behavior OP\u2019s father and step-mother are displaying is a form of abuse called \u201cparentification of a child\u201d, and the ramifications of it can be devastating.\n\nNo, they aren't at all.\n\n&gt; I was a parentified child. Now I have an extremely difficult time saying no to people, and have found myself in multiple abusive relationships because I never prioritize my needs above another person\u2019s, even if it puts me in harm\u2019s way.\n\nI'm sorry you were parentified, but again, that doesn't apply here.\n\n&gt; The advice people are giving OP in this thread is sound.\n\nIt's really not. It's damaging, because it is going to make OP grow up thinking they can just not do things they don't want to do, even thought sometimes in some situations you just have to swallow your pride/stubborness and do the thing. And OP's situation is DEFINITELY one of those swallow your stubborness situations.",

It\u2019s very difficult for able bodied youngsters to deal with a disabled person, especially when required to do so 24/7 365 days a year. Whilst you might have wanted a big sister, you wanted one you could laugh and joke with and do things with, not a handicapped one who can\u2019t do anything for herself. I don\u2019t think you are wrong for not wanting to feed and clean her, and your reason for not wanting to go to the hospital is entirely valid and your dad at least should respect that. Regarding the birthday present - does she even know it\u2019s her birthday/ Christmas, and would she actually appreciate a gift. If not, and you don\u2019t have any money of your own, it\u2019s a bit mean of your parents to expect you to spend what little you have on something like this - and yes, YOUR birthday money from your other relatives is yours to buy yourself something.\n\nUse the great asset you have in your grandmother who seems to listen to you both. Tell her how you feel and what you would like your dad to do - that you want a bit more of his time and attention, and a bit more understanding how you feel. But don\u2019t take your frustrations out on the stepsister - she\u2019s not the one causing your problems, it\u2019s your dad and stepmom! Could you not go and live with your grandmother for a while? Or are there any Uncles/Aunts you could talk to who would then speak to your Dad for you? The suggestions of therapy is a good one.\n\nSadly, I think that one reason they want you to bond with your sister is that they are looking to her future - when they (especially your stepmom) are no longer with us, who is going to look after your sister then? I think you need to make a life for yourself well away from them if you don\u2019t want this to happen. Go to college away from home, find a job well away from them (but visiting often), and make it clear that you are not prepared to take on the responsibility should she outlive them.",

    "postText": "There is an atrist touring this year that I really want to see and it will be the only chance I get to see them live. When the tickets went on sale they were more expensive than I expected so I couldn't afford them. The I got told from work that I am getting a pay rise from next month so I said as a treat to myself I was going to get a ticket when I get my increased pay. I mentioned this to my partner and she was happy for me. I'll only be getting one ticket since my partner isn't really a fan of the artist and it would have been too expensive to get 2 tickets.\n\nMy partner recently saw tickets for an artist she really likes and wants to see live and suggested we go. The show is at the other end of the country (we live in the UK) so would cost a lot for travel, hotel, food and drink etc so I told my partner I couldn't afford it. She said since it's in the same month as our birthdays that this can be our birthday present. I disagreed since it would still be more than I normally spend on birthdays and I didn't want it to be my present. She mentioned that I'm going to be getting tickets for the artist I like and I said yeah and that's partly why I can't afford these tickets.\n\nShe asked if I would get tickets for her artist instead since it means a lot to her but I refused since I'm looking forward to the show I'm planning to get tickets to. She got annoyed and kept going on about how much of a great birthday present it would be but I again told her no. She said she might not get to see this artist again and they're top of her list to see whereas the person I'm going to see I hadn't expressed a big interest in seeing before. I told her it doesn't matter because I'm choosing the one I want to go to. She called me selfish and said I'm causing her to miss out.\n\nAITA for choosing the concert I want to go to over the concert my partner wants to go to?\n\nedit: just to clear something up, my partner wants me to pay for my ticket and travel and half of the hotel costs then we'd get our own food and drink when there.

    "postText": "I(31f) work in a high end retail store and last night a group of teens about 10 or so of them (around 16 to 17 years) and their teacher I assume. They were doing a scavenger hunt looking for sequin tops. My area didn't have any but I knew where there was some the only issue was that it was in the designer area where the items cost $150 for a tank top and up to $10k for other items. I let them know they could find the tops in that section but that they needed to be careful the section was expensive and went to go back to what I had been doing when they came in.\n\nThis is when the teacher came up to me. She demanded to know if I told everyone the section was expensive.\n\nI told her that I often explain it's our designer section to customers yes and that in this case we have teens who are not shopping so I wanted to make sure they knew they needed to be careful in the area not because I felt anyone couldn't afford it but because some of those items run $400 plus for one item. \n\nShe kept insisting that I should watch what I say because it could come off offensive and that I should have just walked them over to the section instead. All I could think was that no matter what I said she was going to find it offensive. She kept going on about reporting me to my bossed for my offensive wording. \n\nTo me it was poor taste to bring a group of students to a high end store or even a store in general for a scavenger hunt. I understand trying to find things to do for students and I even attempted to help them. She seemed to expect me to stop doing my job to attend to her and the students who were only there to play a game.",

Like it was a whole ass table that had been absolutely wrecked and I was folding them back into their neat piles, arranged from larges on bottom to smallest size on top, each cashmere sweater arranged by color/pattern. This was a 6 foot table.  I'd finish a stak of sweaters and she went behind me and undid the entire stack after I finished. She did this for the entire table. It made me so mad. After she was done she demanded to know why the size she wanted wasn't on the table. I had to put my best customer service smile on and went and looked up the size she wanted. Which by inventory was sold out. She stormed out in a huff.\n\nOnly other guy I remember bought a full length real leather trench coat. It was like $900. He had gone to several stores trying to find a similar coat but they didn't have his size (big dude), and I managed to find one for him. Dude slipped me a $50 on the sly before going to cash out. Never saw him again.  \n\nI worked retail from age 17 to 20. Never again.",

We looked around and the ball was in the last room she had been in (must have for some reason took a memory snapshot of seeing it there) but she was certain she had just seen it in the current room.

The stakes at a high end boutiques are much higher than at, say a Target or Walmart. \n\nAlso, how is OP\u2019s claim of not noticing colour a cop out? I mean it\u2019s a group of students, OP spoke to the group collectively. Why would you take note of the race of every kid in the group? Actually, if OP did take note of their races, then I might worry about racism..",

The teacher is assuming that what you meant is some variation of \"you kids look poor - you can't afford to buy anything in that part of the store\".  That's not what you meant, and it's not a reasonable interpretation of what you said in context. The teacher is overly sensitive, and probably not very bright.\n4. Probably not a teacher. Teachers don't usually take groups of kids on scavenger hunts to malls in the evening. This sounds more like a girl scout troop and their leader, or something of that nature.\n\nNTA",

Just seems like an abuse of peoples time and the assumption that no one will call you out.\n\nThen getting offended at the suggestion that some clearly non customers want to rummage around expensive merchandise for their little hunt that has nothing to do with the business.\n\nI'd tell the teacher you plan to call the school and ask them not to treat private property as school grounds.",

If you usually tell your clientele, \"this is the designer section\" and added the part that it was expensive because they were teenagers and it might not have sunk in that \"designer\" means \"expensive\", then I don't see a problem with it. And I agree with you: It is in poor taste to bring a group of kids into a store to play a game that involves rushing around to get to something first, regardless of whether they were planning to buy it- it's disruptive and not fair to legitimate clients.",

No it's not a race thing, but what average highschool kids or teacher do you know with that kind of money? Not very many at all. That teacher I think was a bit dense for having all those kids storm into that store than getting mad when an employee just says be careful. The teacher is the asshole",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI(31f) work in a high end retail store and last night a group of teens about 10 or so of them (around 16 to 17 years) and their teacher I assume. They were doing a scavenger hunt looking for sequin tops. My area didn't have any but I knew where there was some the only issue was that it was in the designer area where the items cost $150 for a tank top and up to $10k for other items. I let them know they could find the tops in that section but that they needed to be careful the section was expensive and went to go back to what I had been doing when they came in.\n\nThis is when the teacher came up to me. She demanded to know if I told everyone the section was expensive.\n\nI told her that I often explain it's our designer section to customers yes and that in this case we have teens who are not shopping so I wanted to make sure they knew they needed to be careful in the area not because I felt anyone couldn't afford it but because some of those items run $400 plus for one item. \n\nShe kept insisting that I should watch what I say because it could come off offensive and that I should have just walked them over to the section instead. All I could think was that no matter what I said she was going to find it offensive. She kept going on about reporting me to my bossed for my offensive wording. \n\nTo me it was poor taste to bring a group of students to a high end store or even a store in general for a scavenger hunt. I understand trying to find things to do for students and I even attempted to help them. She seemed to expect me to stop doing my job to attend to her and the students who were only there to play a game.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why should it only apply to designer clothes?\n\nWhile it is not in your intention to be offensive or anything, your well-intentioned remarks may do come as condescending to others.\n\nAnd to a mild extent, you are profiling the students.

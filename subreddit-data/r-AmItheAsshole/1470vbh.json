                            "comment": "A number of years ago, a friend asked me to read a prayer at her wedding. I, like you, often get choked up \u2014 though at the time of this wedding, I hadn't yet realized this about myself \u2013 and I got choked up when I tried to read the prayer. I was just so happy for my friend and her now-husband, and I started crying, and struggled to get through the prayer \u2013 to the point that the groom left my friend's side to bring me his handkerchief! I was mortified that I'd done this, because I always feel like a huge idiot when I do stuff like that, but it was involuntary; I couldn't help it. \n\nLater, during the reception, I was walking back to my table from the buffet and overheard someone else saying to my friend and her husband, essentially, 'I'm so sorry that GothicGingerbread ruined your wedding by making such a spectacle of herself!', but my friend and her husband (who couldn't see me, as I was behind them, so they weren't just trying to make me feel better) were genuinely confused by what the woman said. They asked her why on earth they would be upset that I was so happy for them that I was overcome by it? They said were deeply touched that I cared so much about them, and absolutely did not feel that I had ruined their wedding.\n\nMy point is that I understand how you feel, I have been in your position before, and while there will always be jerks like that woman, it is rare for the people who really matter \u2013 your brother and SIL \u2013 to feel anything but genuinely touched by the knowledge that you cared so much about them that you just couldn't restrain yourself.",

The important thing is that you stepped up.\n\nThe closest thing to an explanation is that it is unusual for the MOH to be a relation of the groom, so it is somewhat unusual for the groom's side to make it into a MOH speech. IMO, it means something profound for the groom's family to give their heartfelt blessing to the marriage through a MOH speech. You are not so bound by tradition when it accomplishes an important purpose.",

Being MOH is not taken so seriously here as it is there (my main role during the ceremony was to make sure that my SIL's dress was perfect for the pictures, and the speech). In fact, in weddings here there is not a distinction between MOH and bridesmaid, and the literal translation to my language of the women accompanying the bride during her wedding is maids of honour. Hope that clarifies things!",

My (27F) brother (31) got married last weekend and it was an amazing wedding. My SIL (31) asked me a year ago to be her MOH and I accepted because honestly? She's amazing and I love seeing how happy she makes my brother.\n\nEarlier this year both my brother and her asked me to give a speech at the wedding (my SIL's brother would give one as well), and I accepted. Now, I'm a really emotional person and I cry very easily despite looking very stern (I have quite the case of resting bitch face lmao). Both my brother and my SIL know this, and we even joked at the time that if someone cried at the wedding, that would certainly be me.\n\nFour days before the wedding, my maternal grandfather (87) was hospitalised due to several issues and the doctors told us that it was a matter of days before he died. I've always been very close to my grandfather, so I was really sad. I knew that it was coming, but damn it hurt anyways.\n\nWell, the wedding day arrived and it went well (my grandfather was still hospitalised). As I was giving my speech and I got to the emotional part, I began to cry (both because I was just so damn proud and happy for my brother and SIL and because I was sad for my grandfather). When I was done, my brother and SIL hugged me and cried with me, thanking me for the speech.\n\nAfter that, I just went for a little walk in the gardens to calm down because I didn't want to dampen the mood any longer. One of my SIL's aunts (who I met that day) followed me and told me that I \"was a brat for trying to take the attention from the bride and groom with my pathetic sob story\". I was shocked and told her that that was absolutely not my intention, but she said that I was an \"attention-seeking b****\".\n\nOnce I was calm enough, I went to talk with my brother and SIL and asked them if they were mad at me for crying. They told me that absolutely not, that the speech was beautiful and they knew how emotional I am in general, but even more then since my grandfather was in the hospital. They even thanked me again for giving that speech.\n\nI don't know what to think, maybe they are just being nice and it really bothered them as my SIL's aunt said? AITA for crying at my brother's wedding?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

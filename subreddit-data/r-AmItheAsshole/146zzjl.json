Yes, you're helping her now but that doesn't undo the damage already done.\n\nKeep doing what you're doing that benefits each girl. Family therapy would be a huge benefit for everyone.",

It\u2019s a trauma and needs to be addressed on top of what you are doing for your eldest daughter. Throwing money at it doesn\u2019t undo the past and you need to acknowledge the fact that you gave your older daughter a traumatic childhood.",

Daughter needs to grow tf up and stop whinging about something that no one can change.\n\nThis comments section - blaming the parents for not having the $$ at the time and then bettering themselves too late - is a sad indictment on our society.

She is also providing a much better financial quality of life for one daughter than she was able to provide for the other daughter, and it's understandable that the older daughter is angry and resentful. Were I OP I would - within what I could afford - do what I could do to \"even the balance sheet\" a bit more than she's doing, because of course Kathy will get college paid, and she should. \n\nBut maybe OP should treat Sam to an all-expenses-paid trip to France or Italy (not a family trip with Kathy - this would be a trip for Sam and OP to take, assuming someone was available to care for Kathy). Maybe OP should write a check for Sam to refurbish her wardrobe, have some special unnecessary \"extras\" that her younger sister DOESN'T get, simply to impress upon Sam that Kathy ISN'T the golden child now that OP has money. It's what I would do, to address the understandable resentment and preserve the family relationships going forward. This may be one of those problems that can be fixed by throwing money at it in a thoughtful way. If it is, then OP should do just that.",

I could hardly take care of myself - I was poor, from a poor family, and I made stupid decisions. I can't imagine having a child as well.\n\nI don't know if OP's response was right. But we don't know how long they discussed this. All we know is that her adult daughter threw a jealous fit over her 14-year old little sister.\n\nI totally understand the jealousy, and I'm not saying that she was wrong for feeling it. But shouting at her baby sister that she should be going to a shit school and wearing hand-me-downs (both of which I did) is ridiculous, immature, and frankly really mean. She seems to be doing well now, and she should be thankful that her mother worked so hard to be able to help her enjoy her young adult years without struggle.\n\nETA: It actually really aggravates me that so many people here seem to think that OP CHOSE to suddenly make an effort when her second daughter was born. My god. We have no idea what OP's life experience was. To me, she seems to be a hardworking woman who went through some hard times and figured it out in the end. She worked hard, going to school at night to get her degree and then to find a good, high paying job - how difficult is that? It's not easy. It's fucking not easy. Life is hard. And now both of OP's daughter don't have to suffer like their mother did to survive on their own.\n\nOP: NTA",

You seem to think OP is a bad person for having been poor when they had their first child. Also, it isn't easy to turn things around and not everyone can. They may not have been able to do it before or they may not have felt like it was possible if they didn't know other people who had managed it. \n\nI get why the older daughter is resentful, but OP is not an asshole for taking too long to become well off. I don't think they could cut off their older daughter either, I think it's a valid point to make as older daughter's request is ridiculous, but not something they should actually do. And yeah, I understand how unfair it feels to have different people in the family in different circumstances. My cousin gets a free house and I can't afford one as we both live in a high cost of living area. It sucks and feels so unfair. But I don't think my parents are bad people for not having an extra house to give me like my aunt does her kid. Also, my parents both went to grad school during my childhood and make a lot more money now then they did when I was a kid. I understand that too. (Not enough to buy me a house, though, as they went into public service type jobs.)",

Shaming people for being poor seems small-minded.\n\nOP is to be commended for improving her situation despite how difficult it was, and she\u2019s to be commended for helping her older daughter launch into young adulthood. She\u2019s doing what she can, it seems to me.\n\nSam\u2019s feelings are understandable, but it\u2019s unfair and illogical for her to take it out on her sister, or to demand that her sister be deprived in the name of fairness. It\u2019s not Kathy\u2019s faults, and she\u2019s not a spoiled brat just because her family\u2019s in a better place now.

It\u2019s challenging to try and \u201cbetter yourself\u201d when you are trying to balance a current job and family. \n\nOP made big changes \u201cpulled herself by her bootstraps\u201d which I thought everyone would applaud. Instead she\u2019s being shamed for \u201cnot doing it soon enough?\u201d Let\u2019s say instead she hit a modest lottery, should she still not spend it because big sis is jealous?\n\nShe IS helping the adult daughter. Debt free college and a place to live and family vacations, that\u2019s pretty significant. She can\u2019t change the past. I\u2019m sorry that daughter feels that way and I understand why, but it\u2019s ridiculous to suggest the other daughter not get anything more than she did.",

Not sure whether this is ignorant or just misguided. There is a robust body of research about the importance of parental attention on babies in stimulating cognitive development and learning.

It's the way of life that children are raised differently when there are age gaps. OP mentions in the comments that they were making progress financially and career-wise just before the recession, so the recession completely set back any progress they'd made and then some. By the time OP was able to enact the changes that would lead to an improved life for the whole family, the benefit would be felt most by the youngest. It is what it is. Getting financially stable takes time. \n\nAs the youngest in my family, I got a different childhood than the oldest in my family. My parents were older and more laid back with me, but due to the recession, I got no assistance with college. My sibling, on the other hand, had significant help with college and was able to start working in their career field just before the recession struck. While the financial ramifications have dramatically affected my ability to build wealth by comparison, I would not EVER wish my older sibling had had less help, so it would be more \"equal.\" It would be incredibly toxic if I wished ill on somebody I love. As for my parents, they did the best they could with the knowledge they had at the time. \n\n The daughter seems really entitled and is letting it embitter her. Most people can't afford to fund their children's college and pay for their rent (that's great that she had access to that privilege, especially after growing up in a low-income house).  The daughter is allowed to have her feelings and be upset, but the second she wished suffering onto her sibling, she crossed a line. \n\nDo I think she deserved to be completely cut-off? I would have likely tried something less drastic if I were OP.  (Ie. requiring the daughter go to therapy if she wanted housing/phone assistance, etc.) \n\nOverall, I think ESH. The daughter is bitter and acting toxic. OP should have responded in some fashion, but I think they went a bit overboard without ever addressing the underlying issues.",

The implication is that OP is an AH because he didn't love the eldest enough and get rich before having her...what type of thinking is that. \n\n\nI think the eldest is being really hurtful...but for what? It's not like OP can change the past. They have money now so eldest gets her tuition paid and rent. It seems like the eldest is still very much part of the family unit (2* vacations as well). What more can OP do for his daughter (apart from time travelling)? And why can't OP spend on the younger one. Why does the youngest daughter 'need' to live in poverty just so the eldest daughter can feel better and less jealous?\n\n\nTo me the eldest is being cruel and hurtful. Yes it sucks to grow up poor but OP has finally changed the circumstances. Yes, doing so earlier would have given them similar 'materalistic' childhoods (there's no indication that OPs behaviour between daughters has changed apart from younger one getting nicer material stuff, nicer opportunities). But OP is only human. Can we really blame him for not being successful immediately for kid #1. Eldest is still young too. Why be hurtful over things that can't change/play the blame and guilt game whe you can foster a kind and loving relationship with your dad and sister instead..",

I sometimes see discussions around how redlining, generational wealth, and race connect with this.  A lot of people are upset and a lot of people are trying to change the status quo so kids can receive equal outcomes regardless of who they happen to be raised by or what family they're born into.  This is a real-time example of that.\n\nAssuming you were completely unable to control your financial circumstances (which is possible), then it still makes sense that your older daughter would be upset.  She missed out on a lot of childhood security and might never do as well in life as she could have if you had been more well off.  The anger and upset she feels makes sense.  It's clearly misdirected at your younger daughter (who has no say in her financial circumstances and should absolutely *not* be forced into artificial poverty), but it's understandable, and she might benefit from some therapy to work through her emotions.\n\nHowever, your response to hearing a louder version of \"I'm feeling insecure about the fact that I had a rough childhood due to financial instability and I'm jealous of this child who has it better\" is to... threaten further financial instability onto her?  That's absolutely AH behavior and not at *all* a reasonable escalation.  It's almost like you're trying to punish her with poverty, which is probably one of the fears she had in this whole situation anyways, and is therefore now reinforced?  What were you expecting to happen?",

You need family therapy and to sit down with your daughters and partner) you said we realized things need to change so I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s another parent in the picture. \n\nWhen you realized things needed to change, you were around less for Sam during years where Sam can remember this but Kathy can\u2019t. Sam: grew up poor, parent gone at work and classes all the time until she was an adult. Kathy had a at least a middle class life with 2 adults around for 2/3 of her childhood. \n\nIt\u2019s a no brainer why Sam is jealous and resentful. She wasn\u2019t important enough for you to change her circumstances but her younger sister was? She\u2019s spent over a decade living with that resentment, having to work harder, and seeing her sister get opportunities she never had. \n\nWhen she was 14, she was probably worried about how she would even be able to go to college. Her sister never had to go through that. \n\nThere\u2019s a difference between equality and equity. Equality would be giving them both the same resources, which at this point, you didn\u2019t do and can\u2019t fix. \n\nEquity would be making this up to Sam by doing more for her as an adult. For example: if she wants to go to grad school, contributing more to that as she was at an educational disadvantage. When buying a home, contribute more to the down payment. Maybe offer to help Sam upgrade her current wardrobe or contribute to a trip she\u2019d like to take with her friends. Things that help her feel like she\u2019s being taken care of in the way she never was as a child. But threatening to stop paying her rent is cruel. \n\nYou will need to have a conversation with Kathy about why this is happening, so she understands that you\u2019re helping Sam in a way you weren\u2019t capable of doing when Sam was younger and that Kathy is fortunate to have these opportunities her sister did not.",

We lived paycheck to paycheck, we had food, heat, and the mortgage but couldn't afford anything extra. I remember saving up birthday/Christmas money for YEARS to buy things I wanted for myself (even with mom and dad paying for half of big purchases)\n\nMy dad is extremely stubborn and it took him hitting the pay ceiling and not being guaranteed a job to have a job in 5 years before my mom could convince him to go back to school and get his bachelor's degree. So my life was uprooted in the middle of my 9th grade year and we moved states. Once I graduated highschool my parents gifted me a laptop one of his friends had rebuilt/refurbished. The thing was a brick and looked ancient. Was I a little sad and disappointed...of course but I knew that was what my parents could afford plus this way I wouldn't have to do all my future homework in the library!\n\n  I always knew that I would be using loans to get through college. My parents loved me and wished they could help but they just didn't have much money.  They did pay for the meal plan for my first year so even if I couldn't go out with my friends I knew I would never go hungry.  The rest I paid with loans, a scholarship, and a job. \n\nFast forward to when my younger sisters graduated, 4 years apart from each other. By this time my dad had finished his bachelor's degree and gotten a master's degree through WGU. So each of my sisters got a brand new laptop. \n\nI was so jealous and mad that they got nice computers while I got a brick.  They could get new clothes while I mostly survived on hand me downs from my cousins.  Of course I was happy for them when they graduated but jealousy is a hard monster to deal with. \n\nBy the time they graduated I was married and my husband and I were very blessed and had were actually better off than my parents. So I wasn't jealous that they had something I couldn't but that they got the childhood I couldn't have. \n\nNow I've mostly worked through the jealousy.  I worked through it looking at what I gained by growing up poor. I have a stronger work ethic than my sisters especially the youngest!  I know how to save money, my middle sister does ok saving but my youngest spends her paychecks as soon as she gets it. And the biggest positive for me is that I'm very down to earth. My youngest sister is EXTREMELY entitled and doesn't even realize it.\n\nYou are trying to make it up to your oldest as best you can. She'll just have to work things out either on her own or through therapy. She'll have to realize you did the best you could when she was young. And eventually she'll realize that there are advantages to growing up how she did.  I'm not saying it'll be easy because I know first hand how difficult it can be to overcome jealousy",

Making up for it means giving her something that she won't give Kathy (doesn't mean take something away from Kathy and give to Sam). \n\nFor example helping Sam with the downpayment on her house or giving extra support for a wedding compared with Kathy. Since the difference in childhoods means that Sam is inherently disadvantaged compared with Kathy as earlier investments in a child's development are more beneficial and Sam doesn't seem to have gotten much in that area.",

Instead of finding joy in her change of circumstances and having gratitude for what she has now, she wants her sister to suffer.  Why?\n\nMoney problems are never about money.  Were you absent more in those lean years?  Have you favoured Kathy?\n\nWhy was the DC trip such a trigger?  Why are the Aunts on her side?  They must have seen how you have struggled to get ahead.  Are we missing some of the story?\n\nLOTS of kids grow up in rags and without toys and don't leave the neighbourhood they grow up in.  And, they are well adjusted and put THEMSELVES through school and are respectful to family.  So, why is Sam having such a hard time and lashing out?\n\nYou need to figure out the why's before you can know how to solve this.",

            "comment": "My mom went back to school when I was 10 or 11 and I was doing online school for 3 years so she didn't have to drive me anywhere. She started working pretty soon after that, while I and my two older siblings would get to high school through walking, bussing, or driving ourselves. My freshman year, I walked a mile to and from school every day with exercise induced athsma and feet flatter than a nuclear bomb testing site. I had no other choice so I dealt with the pain.\n\nMy younger sister is 5 years younger than me, and the last kid. I often drove her to her bus stop in the morning, and then to school on the days she got ready suspiciously slowly so she would miss the bus and I would have to log onto work late. My hours were flexible since it was a from-home desk job, but I still had set hours I tried to make. Once she reached high school, the bus was no longer an option and I was driving her through high school traffic on the days my parents couldn't do it. I became bitter because my parents didn't make her walk the way they made me walk, and it was being pushed onto me when she should not have been my responsibility. It would hurt less if she was thankful and kind during this time, but she acted like the typical spoiled teen whose parents didn't feel like saying no.\n\nMy parents brushed off my concerns and complaints because they didn't see how she treated me, they didn't see how it affected my stress level, and they didn't realize how hard I had it when I was her age. So I'm gonna say INFO, how is the relationship between your daughters? You are not TA for giving your younger daughter a better life, but you are also not justified in taking away your older daughter's rent either. I get it, she should be grateful for anything in the first place, but when one child gets more and the other complains, taking even more from her is not a solution. What is she to do now? Risk her grades by getting a job that likely won't be able to pay her rent anyway? Drop out and waste all the money spent in the first place? \n\nMy parents had to learn the hard way, I got married and moved a thousand miles away from them because I was tired of things staying the same. Your daughter needs therapy, not a bigger rift.",

            "comment": "YTA and here's why:\n\nYou just announced that you're going to yank financial security away from the daughter who grew up without any financial security.  Lack of financial security affects a person's state of mind and decision making a long time after they have achieved financial security.\n\nKathy will have an entirely different outlook on life, and her expectations for herself, than Sam because of the differences in how they grew up. \n\nYou need to get Sam some therapy, not to help her interact with Kathy better, but to help her grow past any unproductive aspects of the mindset that financial insecurity in childhood can produce.\n\nThen get her at least one big thing/experience that only she gets, and Kathy does not get a corresponding thing/experience.  Not to put Kathy down, but to raise Sam up; to tell her that she's good enough to deserve all the things that Kathy gets now, but you just couldn't provide them for her at the time. \n\nIf you have to scale back on giving Kathy everything her heart desires to make this happen, do it.  Don't announce that you are taking from Kathy to pay Sam back, because you aren't -- you are distributing your resources more equitably.  But if (as an example) Kathy has to go without designer clothing for a bit so Sam can go to Europe for a month, that's only reasonable. \n\nIf there are extra experience or things that will add to Sam's college experience or boost her career, let her have those. Will having a top of the line computer or art supplies help her?  Will going to a certain conference help her?  A study abroad opportunity? A special workshop or a chance to work with an important person in her field? If so, help make that happen.",

She\u2019s always acted as a second mother to me, as she filled in the blanks left by negligent parents.  She\u2019s a wonderful person - a successful wife/mother/employee who married a wealthy man and and has a very good life.\n\nWe have a good relationship, with the one exception that she is very jealous of me in weird ways.  Ex.  Even though she\u2019s been to Hawaii three times, it still really bugs her that I was taken there by our parents when I was 13, and she mentions it often.  I got my own bike, when she had to share one with her sister etc. \n\nMy feelings:\n\n- I want to remind her that I had had nothing to do with how much money our parents spent on me when I was a kid;\n- there were things I perceive her to have had that I didn\u2019t, like young parents who had energy to play etc.\n- as of now, in our 50s and 60s, she\u2019s more than evened up the \u201cscore\u201d in terms of material wealth - something that\u2019s never bothered me.\n\nI only add this to showcase how much long term damage can happen without any malice on the parents part to siblings being treated differently.  It\u2019s crazy how much affect it still has 40 years down the line.",

My bet is she was bullied and blames it on being poor and she didn't tell you or you didn't see it and she's very very angry. I could be wrong, but there's more at the bottom of this and you need to be kind and keep reaching out and asking her to talk. You are the asshole for threatening her rent when clearly she's had a life of feeling unsafe and insecure and has leftover trauma from that. Why did you only decide to change and do better when your second daughter was born? Why didn't you figure out you needed to change long before that? I am going to come down on YTA",

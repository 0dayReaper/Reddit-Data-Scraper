    "postText": "To facilitate the understanding of this story I will use fictitious names for each person:\r  \n\r  \nMe: Me / Sister: Bea / Mother: Rose / Biological Father: Luke / Stepfather: Mike\r  \n\r  \nI (19M) am a trans man. I came out to my family about 8 years ago.. I always knew that my grandparents were religious and some sides of the family were slightly prejudiced or just inconvenient, so I already knew what kind of ties to cut once I came out.  Since I was born, 5 years before my sister Bea (14W), I have always had health problems due to a hereditary disease.. I spent years of my life going to the hospital every month needing emergency blood transfusions. I always had a troubled relationship with Bea, since she was the youngest and was practically spoiled 24 hours a day.\n\nAlthough I constantly felt bad about being excluded and left out by Bea, I didn't care much as there was still a shred of family love in my heart that belonged to Mike, it kept me from breaking down. But on one specific day, my heart broke for good. I had been excluded from any and all posts on their social networks, all the gifts, all the letters I sent him over the years went to rubbish, simply discarded in pieces. From that moment on, I broke down. I started crying frantically and felt a part of me disappearing, the only part that really made me feel good.\r  \n\r  \nAfter all this, Bea would come bragging about how Rose was investing in her future.. Arranging an \"easy\" income for herself by buying various expensive materials for nails, which she started making for her school friends, earning a lot of money from it and Rose liked to make it clear how useless and \"lazy\" I was. About how Bea was always better than me at everything, about how I was just \"wandering around\" without trying hard for anything. She made a point of publicly humiliating me to the family, saying in kind and sophisticated words about how I was a disappointment while her \"perfect little princess\" had made 200 to 300 in a single month. I just exploded and started arguing with her, saying that she had no right to complain about me because unlike Bea, I wasn't having the same privileges of having all the necessary materials given to me. I am an artist, making a living from art is difficult, especially in Brazil. Rose started yelling back, saying that these were all just excuses, and that if I was a really good brother, I would understand that my sister needs much more than I did, even though she literally had everything she wanted her whole life.\r  \n\r  \nI broke down in tears and went to my room, missing out on the rest of family game night as the mood had clearly taken a turn for the worse. It's been a few days now and I honestly have no idea what to do. Now Rose is mad at me, saying that i'm such an asshole and she deservers some apologizes.\r  \n\r  \nSo answer me, Am I the asshole?",

I started arguing with her, saying that she had no right to complain about me because unlike Bea, I wasn't having the same privileges so it was harder. She started yelling back, saying that these were all just excuses, and that if I was a really good brother, I would understand that my sister needs much more than I did, even though she literally had everything she wanted her whole life.\n\n2) Because according to her, she thinks it's fair that her younger sister has more privileges since she supposedly has less experience and that I'm ungrateful for complaining about her having everything and me \"supposedly having nothing\" when she's been \"nice enough\" not to kick me out of the house as soon as I turned 18.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As closure, I would have a \"family meeting\" and explain all of this in greater detail to your sister and mom and let them know this is the last time you will bring this up and air out your feelings, tell then you're not sorry or going to lie and apologize for being a living breathing human with feelings and speaking honestly whereas you get annoyed and put down and hurt in return. As someone who believes in God, if they try to pull some religious crap you should point out their hypocrisy with how hateful, judgemental, and hurtful they are to you. Once you have your closure (airing out all your thoughts and feelings as well as receiving their response.) Then you'll know whether to keep these people in your life. If you are not in a situation to leave, you can wait to have this discussion if you don't feel comfortable yet. \n\nNot to worry, even if these assholes never change, you'll have your own family one day. Family is not always blood after all, and I'm sure you'll make wonderful connections. \n\nI hope all goes well and you are able to be happy, safe, and loved.",

I know this trans woman who 5 years after full transition is just now being called by her social name by her mother. Whereas her father was disconcerted at first but came to fully accept it. She's almost 30, so a late bloomer, and could support herself already. You're not yet capable of being fully independent. \n\nAccept that some things are outside your control and that their prejudice is THEIRS, you can't realistically change that. The change must come from themselves, internally. Then they can be proud of you, if only because transitioning is difficult as hell, and you're doing it.",

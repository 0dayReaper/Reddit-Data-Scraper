    "postText": "So.  Much.  Drama.\n\nSo my SIL has two kids - one born shortly before the pandemic, and one born during.  They live across the country.  My husband and I (this is his sister) have only met the older child.  We were supposed to FINALLY meet the younger one a few months ago, but we all got Covid.\n\nRecently, SIL messaged us to excitedly tell us that she would be \"near\" us for a few days in the summer, and could we come visit where they will be?  To finally meet her kid.\n\n\"Near\" us means 7 hours away. \n\nWe only have a two-day window, between when my husband works and when we leave for an out-of-the country vacation.  And obviously, we need time to get packed, etc for vacation.\n\nMy husband told her that it's not possible.  But now, she and MIL are trying to pressure us to cancel our vacation to see her.  Like, angrily pressuring.\n\nIMO, if she cared about seeing us, she would have consulted us on dates before booking her flights, and that she has to accept that we aren't free.\n\nWIBTA (or rather, would WE) if we hold firm and don't visit while she's 7 hours away?",

The reality is that when you grow up and have adult lives based on opposite sides of the country, you may not see each other for years at a time.\n\nIf SIL really wanted to see your family, SHE could arrange her travel so that she was coming TO YOUR LOCATION. Not 7 hours away from you, but actually coming to where you are. \n\nThat's not what she's doing.\n\nSo I would not drop everything and disrupt the plans you already have in place for your trip. I would calmly tell SIL/MIL once that you are sorry, but it's not going to work out this time and you hope you will be able to see them at some point in the future when they are in town (or at your MIL's if you regularly travel to see her.) And then stop responding to texts.",

You could bite the bullet and agree to meet halfway 3.5 hours for a few hour lunch or something, but you're not obligated. She could visit closer later in the year, or you guys could make the effort to all the way or halfway to visit her later in the year",

    "postText": "I(29F) am a nail tech who specializes in extensions, acrylics and more recently gel x. I\u2019ve been doing it since 19 and I used it to pay my way though college and now I do it part time. My friend has been a long time client of mine and I\u2019ve done nails on her since college (we were college friends). She always gets acrylics and pays cash so I give her a bit of a discount. I do a full set with gel color and an accent nail which I charge her $50 for. \n\nI\u2019m known for my really fast and precise work. Most people will take almost 2h to do a set with a design. I can get it done is around an hour. My friend usually gives me a 10\u201315% tip which is good to me. She asked me to do nails for her and her bridesmaids. I was also a guest. We negotiated the price as $40 flat for nails as some people just wanted gel with no extensions. There were 8 people in total. \n\nWe were suppose to do the nails the day before but only 3 bridesmaids and the bride showed up as they said a plane with the other 4 (all from Miami where we went to school) got delayed. This is not according to plan but she begged me to come the next morning and I did as a favor for a friend. I had to wake up at 5 am to get there at 7 am to do nails for the other 4 bridesmaids and it was exhausting. I had to rearrange things and rush back home to change and get ready for the party. \n\nThe wedding went well but she didn\u2019t pay me for the nails. Originally she said she was going to pay me but then she said she was going to get the bridesmaids to pay me. It\u2019s been 3 months since the wedding and I still didn\u2019t get 2 of the bridesmaids payments. She also didn\u2019t tip even though I drove an extra 1.5h to the hotel and back to do their nails on sight which is very expensive service normally. I asked her about it and she said she thought the tip was my wedding gift to her. That\u2019s fine but I also bought her a gift for the wedding costing $120 and she didn\u2019t volunteer it back. We also didn\u2019t agree beforehand that my tips would be my wedding gift to her. \n\nI am getting a lot more requests for nails and am able to change $70-80 for my services. My friend saw the new prices and asked for a discount. I use to do it because she\u2019s a friend but after the wedding fiasco I told her because Im part time (I have another full time job) Im taking the high paying clients and with food prices going up I need to eat too. She got mad and called me greedy for not giving her the $50 rate I\u2019d always let her pay even when my normal rates went up",

I told him IF I ever really needed my hair done, and if I was struggling I'd let him know.\n\nBuild your friends and family up, y'all.  Damn!",

You\u2019ve been doing this since you were (again, guessing) 20. \n\nSo tips aside, you\u2019ve made $600 from her a year, for 9 years, which comes to a bit over $5k. \n\nHowever, without you, your friend would have been paying about $80 for a similar quality of work. So really, you **could** have been making $960 a month, and $8640 a year, just from her. \n\nSo, wedding and tips aside, your \u2018friend\u2019 has saved more than $3k through your services. Not to mention time, booking waiting time, and overall experience (if you\u2019re going to sit for an hour with someone, it\u2019s a massive bonus for it to be your friend). \n\nThis woman had more than benefitted from you, even before the wedding. *After* the wedding, she\u2019s insane to think that you\u2019d even keep her on as a client. You completed 7 clients, plus bride - that\u2019s what, $640, if you\u2019d charged what your work was worth? Plus tip, plus travel, plus a $120 gift? Absolutely not. \n\nYour \u2018friend\u2019 is taking advantage. Friends who take advantage aren\u2019t good friends. Personally, I\u2019d drop her as a client, now.

I\u2019ve been doing it since 19 and I used it to pay my way though college and now I do it part time. My friend has been a long time client of mine and I\u2019ve done nails on her since college (we were college friends). She always gets acrylics and pays cash so I give her a bit of a discount. I full set with gel color and an accent is $50. \n\nI\u2019m known for my really fast and precise work. Most people will take almost 2h to do a set with a design. I can get it done is around an hour. My friend usually gives me a 10\u201315% tip which is good to me. She asked me to do nails for her and her bridesmaids. I was also a guest. We negotiated the price as $40 flat for nails as some people just wanted gel with no extensions. There were 8 bridesmaids in total. \n\nWe were suppose to do the nails the day before but only 3 bridesmaids and the bride showed up as they said a plane with the other 4 (all from Miami where we went to school) got delayed. This is not according to plan but she begged me to come the next morning and I did as a favor for a friend. I had to wake up at 5 am to get there at 7 am to do nails for the other 4 bridesmaids and it was exhausting. I had to rearrange things and rush back home to change and get ready for the party. \n\nThe wedding went well but she didn\u2019t pay me for the nails. Originally she said she was going to pay me but then she said she was going to get the bridesmaids to pay me. It\u2019s been 3 months since the wedding and I still didn\u2019t get 2 of the bridesmaids payments. She also didn\u2019t tip even though I drove an extra 1.5 to the hotel and back to do their nails on sight which is very expensive service normally. I asked her about it and she said she thought the tip was my wedding gift to her. That\u2019s fine but I also bought her a gift for the wedding costing $120 and she didn\u2019t volunteer it back. \n\nI am getting a lot more requests for nails and am able to change $70-80 for my services. My friend saw the new prices and asked for a discount. I use to do it because she\u2019s a friend but after the wedding fiasco I told her because Im part time (I have another full time job) Im taking the high paying clients and with food prices going up I need to eat too. She got mad and called me greedy for not giving her the $50 rate I\u2019d always let her pay even when my normal rates went up\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A true friend would support you and pay your rate, a greedy one would take advantage of you (like yours has been all along).

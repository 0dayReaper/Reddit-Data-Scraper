I decided that I wouldn't bring it up unprovoked, but if she mocked my facial hair again I would do the same to her. So when in front of everyone she started pointing out my mustache, I pointed back at her mustache and loudly called it out. I did it a few times (never unprovoked), and my family would always be mad at me, criticizing me for taking \"cheap shots\" against a girl.

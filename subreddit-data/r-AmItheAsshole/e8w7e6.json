I am really glad you're taking steps to care for your mental health - you are worth it. I can tell you firsthand that I grew up without very much materially as a kid and I really didn't care about lots of presents or how fancy the trappings of the holiday were. The best present you can give your little one is a happy parent and memories filled with love. It sounds like you also have a really good heart, so I imagine you'll bring your kiddo up with the right spirit about the holidays, which is giving to others and finding joy in the people you care about. I hope you and your family have such a wonderful Christmas, and thanks for this extremely heartwarming update.",

I work to reunite young foster children and their biological mothers, and I tell the moms time and time again- the kids don\u2019t want a perfect parent, a perfect house, or a million toys, they just want *you*.  Many of our moms are struggling with poverty, addictions, mental health issues, and they don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re good parents. But, \n\nWhen the kids are scared at night and we\u2019re trying to calm them, they\u2019re crying for *you*.\n\nWhen the kids come home from school with artwork or a good grade, they want to show *you*. \n\nWhen the kids rush to the Christmas tree in the morning to open the many presents they have, they want *you* there.\n\nWhen the kids are on stage at school for their first performance, they look out into the crowd for *you*. \n\nThey don\u2019t care how much money you have, if you\u2019re wearing Gucci, if you drive a Honda, or if you graduated college. They just want you and your attention, your love, your presence. I\u2019ve had toddlers face immense abuse from their parents, to the point where the parents where jailed, and they still want them there on Christmas morning, they still miss mom and dad. And I\u2019ve had preteens tell me how hard they see their single mom trying, and that they\u2019re not mad at her for not having a turkey dinner or only having one gift under the tree. I\u2019ve had teens bring me to tears explaining how proud they are of their dad keeping the home together after mom left.\n\nI promise every single one of you reading this, **your kids just want you and your love.**",

I don\u2019t think that this is *necessary*, but if there are tickets or a limited amount of adults per child can come, then I would absolutely send an email assuring the foster parent that you are happy to accommodate more people for Child.\n\nI could go into a whole essay about foster children and their biological moms once they\u2019re in care, but I\u2019ll keep it short and say that it\u2019s typically up to the foster parent and the social worker as to whether or not it\u2019s a good idea for a child to see their bio parent. Even then, I\u2019ve had kids turn into completely different people when bio parent is around;  so do be aware that negative behaviours you rarely/never see in Child may come up when bio mom is around.\n\nBut again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad idea to let the foster parent know that bio parents are welcome to come to classroom events throughout the year. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t push the subject or anything, but it would be a nice gesture to let the foster parent know that you\u2019re aware of the situation and open to accommodations and any questions they may have! I think it\u2019s amazing that you\u2019re so aware of this, as many teachers are already overwhelmed and may not have the time or resources to extend to children in foster situations. If you ever have any questions you can always PM me for an opinion, haha.",

You can use EstateSales.net to find local estate sales nearby. On my days off I try to check out some. With estate sales people will have priced things out but they always miss items. For example I went to a sale that showed comic books arrived an hour early only to be the 12th person in line with a few comic collectors ahead of me. I ended up in a room no one was in full of vintage movie posters. I bought 60 posters that day with the best being 3 original [Star Wars](https://imgur.com/gallery/ApX2w) posters and an original God Father Poster. The Star Wars posters are valued between $300-$600+ each and I paid $3 a piece. A month or so ago I came across a comic book that was the first appearance of [Batgirl](https://i.imgur.com/fik69B2.jpg) for $10 and its worth $300+. I bought a 1950\u2019s travel poster of [Hawaii](https://imgur.com/gallery/RdKaBbi) for $40 that\u2019s worth $300-$400.\n\nI grew up watching antiques road show(I still watch it) and I think that\u2019s why I like going out hunting for vintage things of value. But there are treasures out there. You can even go to local thrift shops(although I feel kind of bad doing it) and buy stuff to resell. Mercari is a good app for online selling.",

You're not an asshole, you're a person with empathy and with valid feelings, and while even if you'd cancelled Christmas that would have been true, what you did emphasizes those things.

It sounds rediculous but only you and SO know and it gives the toy more play time before being chucked.\n\nI had a situation when my kids were younger, basically my employer always paid on the 28th of the month except December, around 15th ish of the month. Purposefully paid extra with November's pay so December's pay could mainly go to Christmas, only \u00a3200 left to pay for rent, groceries to get us to 28th Jan and everything else was done and paid until 28th January, bought enough groceries to get to the 15th, no Christmas food or presents. Had done it every year for like 8 years since I started so it was fine. Came to about 8th December and there's no signs of our payslips which came out about a week before pay day. We're all like \"WTF?\" 12th December company wide email from HR. No one at all outside of HR knew there was a new HR director, new HR director started in September and when hearing about \"this ridiculous process which costs the company thousands every Christmas\" cancelled it and didn't notify anyone, so we all including most of HR thought we were getting our paychecks as planned middle of December. Now at first they were like \"proove your destitute/desperate and we'll do at least an advance of a portion of your wages\" but turns out nearly everyone did the same thing as me so they withdrew the offer and left staff having to go to food banks/loans etc over Christmas. Well mine and SO's credit was shot so couldn't get any form of credit anywhere, Food banks around us give enough for a family of 4 for 2 days and you can't use them again for at least 3 months. Couldn't get any help from the government as \"earned too much normally, go to a financial advisor to learn to better handle your finances\". That Christmas was due to be horrendous. Our saving grace was my SO was best mates with his manager, on a ciggy break manager asked why he wasn't smoking, he said couldn't afford it and told him what happened, manager got him paid a week early, 15th December. Was only \u00a3400 so once rent was paid and we got our groceries no money left for presents. We had pizza for Christmas Dinner with ice cream for desert, watched shit on TV and the kids unwrapped their old toys and thought they were new as they'd forgotten about them. Once I got paid on the 28th we gave them some more treats without explaining but every so often when Christmas Dinner talk comes up my eldest (now 8, was 4 at the time, youngest was 9 months old) turns around and says \"can't we just have pizza and ice cream like we did years ago? That was the best Christmas ever! We had so much stuff and food was amazing\".\n\nSomething I have learned in the last 8 years? Some of my biggest fuck ups I feel so guilty over are some of the moments my kids have fondly remembered and talked about for ages. Ask my son his favourite memory and it's sitting in the dark in the lounge with me, daddy and little sister with candles, blankets and a picnic playing games and telling stories. I fucked up and forgot to put electric on the meter when I went shopping, shops were closed by the time I remembered and emergency ran out, no cooker/heat nothing until 8 am the next morning, I cried myself to sleep that night adamant I was a shit mum. I woke up the next morning, sorted it and all I heard for the next few weeks was \"can we do it again with lights off etc. That was amazing!\" and he still says favourite memory of all time.\n\nYou have this, she's young, everything is fun including empty boxes which is what most 2-4 year old want to play with on Christmas day as opposed to their actual toys.",

But since I've gotten buried in this project- I've seen so much good and made so many kids and families REALLY happy.\n\n It helps that I don't have time to be depressed- or even to really think. I'm spending 17+ hours a day driving around picking up contributions and then just as much time sorting, packing and then delivering to the families... But it's mutually beneficial. These families that thought they would have nothing- have an awesome Christmas, and I am so exhausted by the actual holiday, that I've slept through Christmas dinner for 3 years and I haven't had to deal with my MIL as a result- WIN/WIN! \n\nI'm glad you were able to do so much good this year. Any I'm had you're taking steps to make things better than you expected for so many!",

This is the heart of xmas, and how it used to be.\n\nOn xmas eve, you and your family can just take some time to drive around and enjoy the neighbors' xmas lights and displays.\n\nThis is the time to enjoy your family.

It just seemed silly to add more toys to all that, and we bought clothes and such constantly (I absolutely had a baby clothes addiction, not ashamed of it at all, would have one again if we chose (not happening) to have a fifth kid.), so wrapping them up seemed silly.  \n\nHe doesn\u2019t remember a Christmas where we didn\u2019t get him presents, obviously.  No big deal.  The photos of decorating, and your toddler\u2019s joy at seeing Christmas lights, that sort of thing?   That\u2019s what matters.

You got the help you needed and some perspective and then you were able to (pretty quickly) support your family and your community. Thanks for the reminder and the inspiration. And thanks for giving back with the update!",

All the tests showed I either had a normal or only slightly low count, but nothing to doctor thought needed medical intervention.  We never did IVF or hormones, just a lot of consults, blood and other fluid testing, and a lot of holding a crying wife with another negative pregnancy test.  The stress was literally killing our chances of conception.  Once we both gave up and decided that it would be ok if we never had kids, she got pregnant immediately after we booked my 40th birthday trip to Cancun to an adults only resort we were considering purchasing a timeshare at.  I got to drink for three people that weekend, but definitely couldn't put a deposit down, seeing as we were no longer going to be \"adults-only\".",

If you can't pay your debt, you can always just stop and when it gets into collections you can use the money you saved to make an offer to pay it off for a fraction of the balance (usually 10%-30%)\n\nIt will take a few years to rebuild good credit and you will need secured credit cards, but hopefully by then you will be using your extra income that went to minimum payments more wisely.\n\nGoogle it. Debt settlement. And always do it yourself.",

Some are more carols, some are the more classical music, etc.  They are almost always free, and I think its a really nice thing you could do with your family that wouldn't cost anything.\n\nMerry Christmas to you and your wife.  I think you may learn something almost nobody really learns which is that Christmas is truly not about the presents.  If you are a practicing Christian than obviously there is the religious aspect of it, but even if you are not, I hope you'll find that family is the most important part of the holidays.",

Can I ask how you found them and the name of their profession?  Do they call themselves a financial advisor or do they use a different name (like budgeter or money planning).\n\nI ask because I've been trying for a year now to find someone who can look at all my father's finances and help him make a budget.  It seems like this should be an easy thing to find but it seems like it's a job that simply does not exist.  I've called financial advisors, but they deal with investments and he has none.  Daily monkey managers don't seem to exist in our area.  Estate planning doesn't deal with the day to day.  Senior services doesn't offer anything.  \n\nThis has been a huge source of frustration and stress to me.  Any suggestions would be appreciated",

This includes things like corporate discount programs for cars, cell phones, theme parks, etc... to personal assistance in the form of credit, marriage, and even addiction counseling.   If your father has no investments, I agree it would be difficult for most mainstream \"financial advisors\" to step in, but try to look for either Credit Counselors or Estate Planners in your area or contact AARP if you're in the States.  I know AARP offers seniors help learning to live on fixed income and such.  Hope this helps!",

    "postText": "Hi all,\nThis is my first reddit post so please bear with me if this isn\u2019t the best. \n\nI(20m) am a straight man while my friend(20f) let\u2019s call her Jane, is bi-sexual.\n\nAnyways, Jane and I were hanging out the other day talking about what we were doing this summer trying to see what we can do in between work and summer classes. Jane then asked me if I want to go to a pride parade with her. As, she wants to go meet more people and celebrate. She is very quiet about her sexuality and has only told me and a few other people about it.\n\nMe with my already introverted self was pretty opposed to the idea of going due to being surrounded by a big crowd of people I don\u2019t know, but another thing is that it is my grandma\u2019s 95th birthday and she is coming to visit. Now I may have only met and been with my grandma about 6 times in the past 20 years (due to us living on opposite sides of the country), but throughout that time she always managed to send birthday and holiday cards without failure. My grandma\u2019s health is declining and these are probably going to be some of her last years with us. So wanting to be able to get to be with her and know her more, I told Jane that I won\u2019t be able to go due to my grandma being in town. Jane got pissed off to say the least and asked me why I would choose an old lady over being there to support her in her time of need. I told her that my grandma is spending her time and money to come visit our family when she doesn\u2019t have the best mobility. So I will definitely spend time with her. Jane then told me that if I don\u2019t go to the parade with her, that our friendship is over.\n\nAITA?\n\nP.S: I should also mention that both of my grandpa\u2019s died from lung cancer before I was born. So this is one of my last chances of getting to know my heritage and hear old stories.",

You get to choose how you spend your time and even if you weren\u2019t going with Jane coz you didn\u2019t want to, it would still not make you TA. Here you have a grandma coming. GRANDMA, and not just an old lady but you know what, if I wanted to spend time with a random old lady instead of going to pride with someone, I absolutely would have the right to and it would not make me TA. People need to learn to tell when there is a crisis and when they are just not getting what they want. Two very different things and Jane has a lot of growing up to do!",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nHi all,\nThis is my first reddit post so please bear with me if this isn\u2019t the best. \n\nI(20m) am a straight man while my friend(20f) let\u2019s call her T, is bi-sexual.\n\nAnyways, T and I were hanging out the other day talking about what we were doing this summer trying to see what we can do in between work and summer classes. T then asked me if I want to go to a pride parade with her. As, she wants to go meet more people and celebrate. She is very quiet about her sexuality and has only told me and a few other people about it.\n\nMe with my already introverted self was pretty opposed to the idea of going due to being surrounded by a big crowd of people I don\u2019t know, but another thing is that it is my grandma\u2019s 95th birthday and she is coming to visit. Now I may have only met and been with my grandma about 6 times in the past 20 years (due to us living on opposite sides of the country), but throughout that time she always managed to send birthday and holiday cards without failure. My grandma\u2019s health is declining and these are probably going to be some of her last years with us. So wanting to be able to get to be with her and know her more, I told T that I won\u2019t be able to go due to my grandma being in town. T got pissed off to say the least and asked me why I would choose an old lady over being there to support her in her time of need. I told her that my grandma is spending her time and money to come visit our family when she doesn\u2019t have the best mobility. So I will definitely spend time with her. T then told me that if I don\u2019t go to the parade with her, that our friendship is over.\n\nAITA?\n\nP.S: I should also mention that both of my grandpa\u2019s died from lung cancer before I was born. So this is one of my last chances of getting to know my heritage and hear old stories.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She\u2019s probably also a little nervous; going to a pride rally can be daunting, especially if it\u2019s your first time, and it\u2019s local enough that you might be recognised. \n\nHowever, while that explains some of her reaction, it does not excuse any of it. She does not get to lash out at you like that, and she is certainly not entitled to your time and attention. It\u2019s great that she wanted your support, but she cannot demand it. \n\nYou have a very valid reason for not attending this pride rally. You have a relative in town, who has come all the way across the country, to spend their birthday with you and your family. That is not something you can miss, and it\u2019s not reasonable to ask you to do so. \n\nI know this isn\u2019t an advice sub, but I do have a suggestion. Reiterate your stance to Jane, via text. Something like \u2018hey, just checking in to make sure you remember that I won\u2019t be coming to the rally this weekend. My grandmother has come across the country to spend her birthday with my family, and it\u2019s just not a commitment I can miss. I\u2019m really sorry, I would have loved to come. Hope you have a great time!\u2019 \n\nJane might flip out. That\u2019s her prerogative. The reason you want to send a text like that (happy, reasonable, apologetic) is so that all your bases are covered if she does. Should Jane decide the friendship is over, she might start telling people, including mutual friends, a few mistruths about *why*, and you don\u2019t need to deal with that. This text (and all associated responses) gives you physical evidence that a) you didn\u2019t desert her in a moment of dire need, b) you didn\u2019t decline to go because you were uncomfortable with the LGBTQI+ community, c) you were reasonable, kind and polite. \n\nI hope you won\u2019t need to use it, but it\u2019s a good plan B to have if Jane hits the fan, which currently seems pretty likely.",

Your parents or extended family might know a fair amount, and is it not possible for a family member or caregiver to set up a way to communicate with her online?\n\nBesides that, your friend I assume is very scared and wants support. So when she lashed out like that I assume she took it as you not supporting her or not being there for her when she needs you. If that\u2019s the case I hope she can find a good support network (because it seems she may not have one if she\u2019s very private about it) and realises that your friendship shouldn\u2019t be conditioned like that. \n\nWhile it was awful of her to get angry at you like that, I don\u2019t feel inclined to call her an a-hole either because there\u2019s a good chance this anger is coming from a place of fear. I heard once that anger itself isn\u2019t an emotion; it\u2019s a reaction to their actual emotion. I hope you guys can sort this out, because we all need as many friends as we can get in this life.",

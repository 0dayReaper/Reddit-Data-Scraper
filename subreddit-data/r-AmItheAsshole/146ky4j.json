    "postText": "I F(19) had a recent confrontation with my mom who\u2019s in her late 50s over the way I dress. A few days ago the weather here was really hot and I decided to wear something shorter and she ended up ranting about how my clothes might send the wrong impression of me and how I should be careful about what I wear when there\u2019s men in the house. \n\nThis has been something she\u2019s said to me for years, considering I just want to be comfortable when I come home from college and I just didn\u2019t believe that what I was wearing was inappropriate so this eventually led to her saying she was concerned for my safety and I argued back to her stating that it\u2019s because she\u2019s jealous and annoyed that men don\u2019t want her these days.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken to my family about this and they\u2019ve told me that I was being an AH but I still don\u2019t think I was.",

If she's claiming to be worried about your safety, she's also buying into the myth that sexual assault has anything to do with sexual attraction. Sexual assault is about power and control. If she holds these views, then she more than likely victim blames and blames a victim's clothing choice when she hears about a victim being assaulted.\n\nInstead of insulting her and telling her that nobody wants her anymore, maybe you could try educate her around these issues. I understand your frustration. Society has tried to control women's bodies since the beginning of time, and it must especially sting that it's coming from your own mother.\n\nIf she does it again, try to educate her. If this fails, tell her that what you wear is not up for discussion, and just continue to do you.",

Did you stop to consider if she's saying what she says because that's what she's heard all her life? Or because that's what she's experienced at some point in her life.",

Even if you are correct that if a woman is assaulted it is the man's fault, you should also not put yourself in that position.  Because being right never stopped anyone from getting Leered at or assaulted.  I'm sure you're beautiful but your mother didn't deserve to be shamed for her age and looks either.  Unfortunately you will probably have to learn the hard way.  As my ex bf said women don't realize it, half of the time when a man sees a woman walking her dog he wants to f the girl and the dog... yes they're that bad.",

A few days ago the weather here was really hot and I decided to wear something shorter and she ended up ranting about how my clothes might send the wrong impression of me and how I should be careful about what I wear when there\u2019s men in the house. \n\nThis has been something she\u2019s said to me for years, considering I just want to be comfortable when I come home from college and I just didn\u2019t believe that what I was wearing was inappropriate so this eventually led to her saying she was concerned for my safety and I argued back to her stating that it\u2019s because she\u2019s jealous and annoyed that men don\u2019t want her these days.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken to my family about this and they\u2019ve told me that I was being an AH but I still don\u2019t think I was.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And who are the men she thinks would make you unsafe -- your immediate family and their friends?  Yikes.\n\nI'm going to put the nicest possible spin on this and suggest that maybe your mom was abused in some way in her home, and that she gropes for a way to explain it that involves blaming herself.  (Maybe I was too provocative?  Maybe if I'd worn a longer skirt it wouldn't have happened?)\n\nThere might well be internalized misogyny here, but maybe there's also trauma.\n\nKnow that men are responsible for their behavior.  Women don't get raped and otherwise abused because their shorts are too short; they're attacked because their attackers are vicious criminals.\n\nAll that said, I think that what your mom is projecting onto you is crazy tunes,  You have the right to dress as you wish.  But maybe talk to her about whether something happened to her.  Just in case.\n\nNTA",

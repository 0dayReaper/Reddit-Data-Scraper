    "postText": "My (31F) cousin \u201cTaylor\u201d (36F) dated her ex \u201cHailey\u201d (32F) for about 6 years before they broke up last fall. Hailey was very close w/the family and got along w/all of us cousins (we\u2019re all close &amp; hang out). Their relationship was rocky for a while. Throughout that time I was there to support Taylor. I offered her advice and gave her a shoulder to cry on, literally and figuratively. I was also friends w/Hailey, but not as close when she and Taylor were fighting. Taylor and I have been close since childhood, but our relationship hasn\u2019t always been the best. She used to bully me and my twin \u201cSam\u201d (31F) when we were growing up. \r  \n\r  \nJust after Taylor and Hailey\u2019s breakup, while still living together, Hailey found out that she has late-stage brain cancer, which has spread to other parts of her body. It\u2019s unknown how much time she has left, especially quality time, but it\u2019s less than a handful of years. Hailey has been on aggressive treatment including radiation and chemo. Taylor has moved out and Hailey is living on her own.\r  \n\r  \nHere is the complicated bit. Taylor told Sam and I that she and Hailey had one final fight (after broken up, but still living together) where Hailey packed Taylor\u2019s bags and kicked her out. Taylor said she was forced to stay in a hotel. I saw Hailey not long after that. Hailey confided to me that she and Taylor fought because in actuality, the night that Hailey received her diagnosis, Taylor was leaving to meet a woman for a date/hookup. Hailey asked if Taylor would stay with her, and Taylor said she\u2019d already booked the hotel room. Upset, as they never did things like that during their relationship, Hailey kicked Taylor out after Taylor left to spend the night at the hotel with her date (24F, who she is now dating).\r  \n\r  \nThis has really upset Sam, who is getting married in 1.5 months. Sam was stressed &amp; upset about the situation and about Hailey (who is also friends with Sam as Sam and I are usually a package deal). Sam reached out to Taylor asking if she was coming to the Bachelorette, which Taylor had agreed to four months ago. Taylor took hours to respond with a non-response (\u201cWhen is it again?\u201d), upsetting Sam. Sam then made the decision to remove Taylor from her bridal party, which Taylor accepted with a passive aggressive message back to Sam.\n\n\rAfter Taylor was kicked out of the bridal party, Hailey was invited to the Bachelorette, since she wouldn\u2019t have any other time to celebrate Sam\u2019s marriage (Hailey is obv not coming to the wedding anymore). We had a fun time! I don\u2019t regret it, and neither does Sam. After we posted pictures on social media, Sam and I saw that Taylor blocked us both. At the end of the day we are not interested in managing Taylor\u2019s feelings or walking on eggshells anymore.\n\nSo, am I the ahole for inviting Hailey to the Bachelorette? It was Sam\u2019s party, but as MOH I was the organizer. What about the big picture? Are Sam and I aholes for continuing to have a relationship with Hailey?",

We were No Contact for a few years when Taylor was with a toxic ex. When we started talking again, Taylor cried and said she regretted cutting us out of her life because she realized that Sam and I just wanted what was best for her. We constantly are there to support her without receiving the same support from her... and feel that in another few years she will be saying the same thing.",

Taylor's relationship with Sam and I has always been complicated. We are second gen immigrants of Asian descent. Her parents have always compared her to us, they were/are hard on her and she is less \"successful\" traditionally (didn't finish college, lives paycheck to paycheck, lives an alternative lifestyle; whereas my sister and I finished school and have traditional careers) so there has always been a lowkey feeling of competition. We always wanted to believe that Taylor was over that, we support her career choices and encourage her where her parents don't. Her blocking us out of the blue without even messaging us hurt, but ultimately shows her true character.",

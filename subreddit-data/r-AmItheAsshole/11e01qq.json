    "postText": "I (40m) have a sister (30f) who is getting married in a week. The groom proposed to her a year ago at a family dinner that left everyone speechless, but very happy for them as they are longtime companions. During this dinner, my sister asked my son (17m) to make her wedding dress. My son has always loved design and fashion, he took technical courses in these areas and sewing, and even his friends keep asking for his clothes because they are so beautiful. He agreed, but said that he needed time and that he would need her opinion constantly. \n\nAt first my sister was very annoying. My son drew about 50 dress designs in a month and she only liked one, which he continued with. He sewed it with great quality fabric which I paid for as I wanted to get involved in a certain way. For five months he made several adjustments to suit her wishes, as she always complained about something. After a while, he arrived at the final model and it was just amazing. My mother cried seeing my sister in the dress and I confess that I almost got emotional too. \n\nThe problem was that last week my son came to talk to me about the wedding invitation that had not arrived for him, but for other family members. I thought maybe he didn't need one, but it still felt weird. I messaged my sister raising this issue and she replied that she didn't want any underage people at her wedding because there would be alcohol. I asked if she was going to make an exception for my son, but she cut me off and said no. \n\nThere are no children in our family, my son is the only minor, so I didn't see any sense in this rule for family members. And to make matters worse, my son was very sad and cried because he spent months on this dress and couldn't go to the wedding. I was very upset and told my sister that she should look for another dress as soon as possible, as she would no longer wear the one my son made. \n\nShe called and yelled at me, saying I was being unreasonable and that I couldn't do this. My mother called me saying I should deliver the dress and follow the rules, but I didn't and hung up on her. Because of this, the family is divided. Many agree with me and condemn my sister's action saying she could only make an exception, but another part says I'm unreasonable and I'm spoiling her big day. \n\nI don't think I'm being wrong but just rational and paying her back in kind. So AITA?\n\n\nUPDATE: \n\nfirst I would like to thank all the comments and suggestions, I really didn't expect my post to resonate so much. \n\nI talked to my son about the suggestions you guys gave me and he agreed to sell the dress at market price. He calculated the price of everything and the value was quite high. We sent the proposal to my sister and she hated it. She said she couldn't afford it because it was too expensive and it should be a gift because \"she is family\". I responded by saying that it was too easy to say she was family to get a free dress, but not enough to include my son. She cried on the call and begged me not to ruin her day, but I didn't call because that to me was bullshit. \n\nAt no point did she offer to just let my son go or apologize for it. \n\nAnd for anyone who said that maybe she's homophobic, I'm not sure, but I think who could be influencing her is her fianc\u00e9 who is a Christian and has never been close to my son. However, I don't care if he's doing it or not. If she wants to exclude my son from this event then she will also be cutting ties with me. \n\nAnd for those who are asking for a photo of the dress, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but my son didn't agree and unfortunately I won't post it because of that. \n\nIf anything else happens I'll let you know, until then, thank you all!",

All the consultations to make those minor alterations over a 5 month period? There're fees for that. Flat out, that's a $20k dress, minimum. NTA and either she pays, you burn the dress on camera(or dissect it and use it as a display to show construction practices) and let it be published as a national story to promote your son to get him in a great design program or apprenticeship, *or* you sell it for college funds. \n\nOP, Tell your mom she's an AH, you ***don't*** demand a family member make you something expensive for free for your wedding and then *not* invite them. That has **never** been ok. Heck, longstanding tradition is, somebody does you a huge favor or kickback, they get to come to yours or your child's wedding. Who hasn't seen a scene with some overly proud guy talking about how his invite was due to the fresh shrimp he provided or whatnot?",

Offer it at 10,000, but make sure you send a link to your AH sister.\n\nAnother option is to check local news outlets and if there is a local woman who needs a dress, or offer it as part of a charity auction.\n\nDO NOT GIVE THE DRESS TO YOUR SISTER UNLESS SHE PAYS FULL MARKET  PRICE.\n\nIf your son doesn\u2019t want to sell it, he should KEEP it as a sample of his skill.   \n\n\nHe could use the dress as a way to get his foot In the door with local merchants by going to local bridal shops and get it appraised (including the designs done that were not used, and fittings).  He could also ask if they wanted to purchase it to sell in their shop.\n\nTell your son that the internet(one small part) is sending support for him, and think he is amazing and deserves to be paid.   \n\n\nIf aunt gives him grief, have him quote Peggy Carter, \u201cI know my value.\u201d",

I kept a full set of samples and even all this time later, I can say that they are really quite good, and not just for my age; I would consider them pretty decent for a junior calligrapher.  For an 11-year-old, they were amazing, if I do say so myself.   \n\n\n\nI am not at all artistic in any other way, but calligraphy seems to be my one \u201cthing\u201d, probably because I can copy it from templates (also autistic, which we also didn\u2019t know at the time, so that stands to reason).   \n\n\nWould I save her from a burning building?  Well, my mother and uncle love her, and she\u2019s still a human being and everything, so yeah.  But I have nieces and nephews now, and you can bet everything you own that there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019d ever treat any of them even a tenth of a tenth as badly - and if I somehow did so by accident, I would expect to be called on the carpet for it immediately, and would apologize from the bottom of my heart.

You have to be 18 to buy alcohol, and at 16 can have alcohol with a meal in a restaurant if accompanied by an adult. If you're over 5 you are allowed to be given alcohol in a private setting e.g. at home (though then any drinking would be governed under child protection law, you really don't want a bunch of 7 year olds knocking back Tequila after all).\n\n\nWithin my family we started trying alcohol in safe settings as we started into teenage years - a single small glass of wine with a meal, a small beer with a barbecue etc. This meant it didn't become this big 'forbidden fruit' thing.\n\n\nOf course we then tried to work out the limits of what was possible - drinking cider and lambrini in parks with friends as we got a little older (and told ourselves that our parents didn't have a clue!), but we'd already got a good idea of what our limit was, how to look after friends who hadn't quite worked that out, and how to control our drinking to just maintain that sociable 'buzz'.\n\n\nGetting older (18+) and going out with different friends at uni you could really see the differences in the approach to alcohol between those who hadn't had exposure from an earlier age and those that had.",

It was noticeable that those who had a problematic relationship with alcohol during university were those whose parents had forbidden them alcohol and only after they moved out had free access to alcohol, which was then often very excessive. Typical case of: Nothing tastes better than the forbidden fruit.\n\nI think it is the job of parents to teach their children a healthy way of dealing with topics with which the child inevitably comes into contact, such as alcohol, but also, for example, sex, money and fast food (I know a few who have a very disturbed relationship with fast food as a result of their upbringing). Making a taboo subject out of it is the worst possible way for a healthy relationship with such topics.",

Some people make such a big deal over things being \"designer.\" It's absurd, but seems like a possible scenario here. \n\nIf a family member made my wedding dress, I would be so excited to tell everyone about it. Heck, I already do that with leggings that my sister designed. Every time someone compliments them I'm like \"thanks MY SISTER DESIGNED THEM!! There's also the same design in another color pallette!\" (I have both colors lol)\n\nAnd yeah, NTA for sure, OP.",

I wouldn't cave on this honestly, its too late, the only reason shes gonna invite your son at this point is because she wants the dress. Its really your son's call, not yours, but I would make her go find a dress last minute off the rack. Thats what she deserves. You didn't \"spoil her day\", she did.

She\u2019s hoping you\u2019ll just give in and agree.\n\nBut you shouldn\u2019t, and you can\u2019t.\n\nThe ultimatum here is simple: either your son attends the wedding as a guest and gets to enjoy the day, knowing he is responsible and won\u2019t be drinking and for having made the dress as his wedding present to her OR you write up a full and accurate bill for a coutour custom dress and payment in full is expected before delivery or no dress will be provided and she can get married in her pajamas for all you care. \n\nI read something once and I live by it: \u201ca gift given in love is a gift to be cherished and treasured. But one scorned and abused is a gift undeserved.\u201d\n\nYour son made a gift out of a labor of love for her. He put his time, creativity, and a bit of his soul into the dress. For her, as a present. She is proving she is undeserving of that gift.\n\nYour family doesn\u2019t matter here. All of the other opinions are worthless. YOU do the right thing.

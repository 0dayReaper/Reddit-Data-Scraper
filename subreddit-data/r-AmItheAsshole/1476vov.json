    "postText": "I (23M) am active duty and got back from deployment April this year and started rooming with my now roommate \"Aya\" (23F). Aya was military, but is now a contractor. Before I moved in, I explicitly stated that I DID NOT want to be a part of the lease since I would be staying for a couple of months before I decided on a place to stay permanently- Aya agreed. We are now in mid-June, and the lease ends in the last week of August.\n\nFast forward to a couple of weeks ago, another friend \"Mike\" (23M) had purchased a home and is looking for two roommates- I told him I was interested. Not only would the room I'd move into be bigger, Mike is willing to charge me $150 less than what I am currently paying Aya in rent. I'm very sensitive about my finances, so I told him I'd move in mid-July this year.\n\nThe news upset Aya because she claims she can't afford the 2bed 1.5bath apartment on her own, even if it's only for the remaining month and a half. I've been paying her 1k dollars for my half of everything, rent and utilities included. She makes more than me, about 5k including my portion of rent and utilities. I make 4k a month, before paying rent and utilizes. It has been 3 months and I've paid her 3k.\n\nAya was living in a cheaper 2bd 1.5bath apartment that she could afford on her own but decided to move out after she separated from the military. She used her separation to break her lease early and moved in to our current apartment since she knew her little sister wanted to room with her (I think I was deployed still). Aya eventually kicked her little sister out due to financial reasons.\n\nAll I can think to myself is \"tough luck, not my problem\". I know a bit about her financial situation, and I know she does nothing to improve it. She'd prefer to game all day than work a second job, try to lower bills, etc. Her finances are not my fault and they aren't my problem, therefore I don't think I need to hold myself back because of her situation if all I've been doing has been paying her 1/4 of my monthly income.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I notified her of my interest to move out roughly two weeks ago, and I made my decision today. For the record, I had no clue our lease was ending so soon until I mentioned I wanted to move out. Given my circumstances, I just barely notified her two months in advance. ",

She used her separation to break her lease early and moved in to our current apartment since she knew her little sister wanted to room with her (I think I was deployed still). Aya eventually kicked her little sister out due to financial reasons. \n\nAll I can think to myself is \"tough luck, not my problem\". I know a bit about her financial situation, and I know she does nothing to improve it. She'd prefer to game all day than work a second job, try to lower bills, etc. Her finances are not my fault and they aren't my problem, therefore I don't think I need to hold myself back because of her situation if all I've been doing has been paying her 1/4 of my monthly income.\n\nAITA? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

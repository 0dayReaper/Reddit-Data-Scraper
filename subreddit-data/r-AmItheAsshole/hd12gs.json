That being said, it\u2019s definitely an AH move for her to reach out to you after a long period of time, seemingly out of the blue just to ask you to break the law for her And to not even invite you to the party after?? \n\nFrom my understanding, you bought the beer with your own money so you\u2019re absolutely not in the wrong for taking it with you once you realized you weren\u2019t being invited to the party. You didn\u2019t yell at her, call her names or do anything rude, just took your beer and left. I actually don\u2019t think you could have handled this better than you did. If there was a stronger judgment than NTA, I\u2019d give it to you!",

If someone is asked to buy beer for a party, the standard social contract is, at the very minimum, an invite to the party.  Usually you get them food as well as they spent their money on beers.  This is so standard that if I were in OPs position, the fact she didn't even say anything about an invite wouldn't have crossed my mind until we got back to my house...  The \"erm, well, technically, she didn't say anything about an invite\" is complete fucking bullshit and we all know it.  If she had been clear from the start and said \"we need beers, but I don't have the space to invite you sorry\" then they likely still get the beers as OP seems like a good dude.  She knew exactly what she was doing, but never mentioning an invite doesn't just remove the social contracts that exist when you ask someone to buy beers using their own cash money as well.",

Dice an onion and add it to the pan. Add some mustard and salt, and if you have I'd recommend a little bit of ground nutmeg and marjoram (it goes so damn well with bratwurst, really). Once the bratwursts browned and are a little crispy, add some beer and let it reduce. Repeat a few times (if you add too much at once or cook the sausages in the beer, they might burst. Still tastes delicious, but doesn't look very appealing). Let it simmer for a bit, until the sauce has a nice consistency. Eat with sauerkraut and a slice of dark bread, or just with whatever you like.\n\nGreetings from bratwurst-land",

I mean, you say 'a few times a week', how many weeks are we talking here? If its more than a couple, that is adding up to dozens of messages to someone who clearly before right now hasn't really encouraged you. The thought of someone messaging me multiple times a week makes me feel really uncomfortable. \n\nNothing excuses this girl from taking advantage of the fact that you clearly have a thing for her (to the point she felt uncomfortable enough to block you) to try and get alcohol out of you and expecting you to drop everything for her (which, to be fair you kinda did despite knowing she had previously blocked you, what was going through your mind here), but I'd take this moment to take a look at those messages and try and work out why your barrage of messages got you blocked.\n\nDid she respond to every message? Did she actively participate in the conversation, asking you questions and trying to move the dialogue forward? Did she give multi-sentence answers? Or did she give monosyllabic answers or do nothing to try and progress the conversation? If she was answering to to polite, it's very different to being engaged in the conversation, and the mere fact that she answered your messages doesn't mean she is interested in you. Do you know anything about her beyond her looks? You aren't part of her close friend group, clearly don't know her personality well, so what is it about her you can't get over?\n\nHot girls can be really shitty (and you are both teenagers which adds to the immaturity), but oblivious guys can also be really shitty. Learn from this shitty girl but also re-evaluate the way you approach women online.",

If something bad happened (drunk driving for example), you might have been on the hook for it.  If the cops showed up at the party, you would absolutely be arrested.\n\nYou're NTA, but you did learn an important lesson.",

    "postText": "My boyfriend (\u201cMax\u201d) and I (\u201cElena\u201d) (30s M/F) have been dating for about 2.5 years, and are going on our first \u201cbig\u201d vacation in a few weeks. The destination is in another country and takes \\~4 hours to fly to. The trip was planned around the following:\n\n1. Us taking a romantic, relaxing vacation to a nice beach.\n2. Making up for not taking a trip for his March birthday. For my birthday last September, we did a two-day, one-night trip to a beach \\~ 3-hour drive from us. We only did dinner for his birthday this year.\n3. Going scuba diving. I\u2019ve been trying to go for ages but my trip has been postponed due to a myriad of factors \u2014 grad school, the panini, unemployment, etc. This is the first year I've been able to afford to go somewhere with good diving, and I am PUMPED. I\u2019m even more excited that I can share it with Max.\n\nMax agreed to get dive certified \u2014 he is \u201cwelcoming of the opportunity,\u201d but isn't as excited as I am. I made it clear that while I'd love to dive at least a little, he shouldn't get certified just for me, esp since it's expensive. We were hoping for a good 4\u20135 days of diving.Max recently sustained a shoulder injury (suspected labrum tear). We won't know for another 2 weeks if he will be able to dive. I said that if he can't dive, I could scale back to just one dive or one afternoon dive trip (usually 2 dives). He feels that I shouldn\u2019t abandon him for an afternoon of our 9-day trip (granted, we\u2019re working 2 days remotely). We both said/done things the other feels is manipulative or controlling (I have written this with input from Max):\n\n* Elena: Tried to justify her absence by saying she\u2019d only be gone 3 hours. In reality, she would want to take a 2-dive afternoon trip and would be gone closer to 5 hours.\n* Max: Said he might not \u201clet\u201d Elena go diving, which upset her because she felt the language was controlling\n* Elena: cried because she was upset she might not be able to go diving. (Dumb, but as above, I\u2019m really psyched for the trip.)\n* Max: asked Elena \u201cif you\u2019re always going to cry if you don\u2019t get what you want.\u201d (I then got even more upset because I felt he was accusing me of being manipulative)\n\nIf the shoe was on the other foot, and my injury would prevent him from doing something he loved (\u201cactivity Z\u201d), I would absolutely tell him to enjoy himself for a few afternoons and would find a way to entertain myself. I have told him this but he says he would not do \u201cactivity Z\u201d without me.\n\nHe feels that it\u2019s unfair of me to abandon him for 5 hours on a vacation we planned together. I\u2019m willing to drastically cut down my diving plans, but would like at least one afternoon of underwater bliss. I\u2019m still planning a birthday excursion day. So, fellow Reddit ANALysts, WIBTA if I took an afternoon to myself to go diving if my boyfriend cannot go due to an injury?",

It's normal for couples to do separate activities on vacation and take small breaks to pursue their own interests.  There's not one thing he wants to do that you're not interested in?  He can't go have drinks at a local bar and watch sports?  He can't go to a museum?  He can't read a book on the beach for ONE afternoon?  That's ridiculous. \n\nYou should not miss out on an opportunity just because he's jealous of it.  He should uplift you to follow your desires, not hold you back because he can't go with.",

He can survive 5 hours by himself - heck, he can do some of his work during that time. \n\nHell, when I was in college, we were taking a family trip to Puerto Rico. My dad tore his achilles heel and would not be able to go. Had to have surgery and not walk, all of a week before the trip. My mom said we're still going and found a cousin who was willing to stop by and help because why should his injury, that he brought on, cancel our trip and fun? Do not let him ruin your trip. It is your trip, too. Go diving and if that's that big of a deal, dive for a new boyfriend.",

I think it\u2019s reasonable that he\u2019s upset by this and doesn\u2019t want you to do solo activities. On the other hand diving is not something you can do anywhere and it\u2019s a huge opportunity you are giving up, but I also feel for him that he probably feels the same and is definitely missing out on his opportunity.\n\n\nPersonally I kind of think he should get over it for an afternoon, possibly look into his own solo activity or maybe a massage. But I can see how him sitting in the hotel room while you are doing an activity he was excited to do with you is gonna suck for him.\n\n\n\nHopefully he is cleared to dive and this isn\u2019t an issue, fingers crossed for you.",

You are traveling together, staying together, eating together, experiencing the destination together- but no one would ever expect you to spend 24/7 together. You are both unique individuals that work well together- if either of you aren\u2019t comfortable expressing your wants and needs and the other one doesn\u2019t listen and understand your relationship is not going to work. My husband and I are polar opposites- his love for history and tours and blah blah puts me to sleep- my love for rest and relaxation at our destinations is a bore for him. We have been married 20 years and travel very well together, he gets to go see the Aztec ruins and I get to read at the beach, we meet up and swim with the dolphins together. We never worry that the other will be upset if we have different activities- but what we always do- and my advice to you is: pick all your must do couples activities and meals etc. these are non- negotiable. And are fun to select- if there\u2019s something you disagree on then add it to your pile of fillers- once your together schedule is selected, fill in the activities you want individually- you each get the experiences you want and great conversation at dinner telling the other about your activity. \nGood Luck.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve become frustrated with how quick a lot of AITA commenters are to encourage OP\u2019s to leave their partners when a challenging experience is posted. While leaving a partner is a necessary action in some cases, just flippantly ending a relationship because conflicts arise is not only a dangerous thing to recommend to others, but it deprives people of the challenges necessary to grow and evolve as emotionally intelligent adults. \n\nWhen we muster the courage to face our relationship problems, and not run away, we develop deeper capacities for Love, Empathy, Understanding, and Communication. These capacities are absolutely critical for us as a generation to grow into mature, capable, and sensitive adults. \n\nEncouraging people to exit relationships at the first sign of trouble is dangerous and immature, and a byproduct of our \u201cthrow-away\u201d consumer society. I often get a feeling that many commenters don\u2019t have enough relationship experience to be giving such advise in the first place. \n\nPlease think twice before encouraging people to make drastic changes to their relationships; we should be encouraging greater communication and empathy as the first response to most conflicts.

My issue is when we equate *difficult* with bad. \n\nWhat happens if a major disagreement arises deep into the relationship? What happens if a partner is insecure and snoops in your phone? What happens if a partner expresses feelings for someone else? Worse yet, what if a partner cheats?  \n\nThere are no simple answers to any of these questions. In some cases YES, leave that person. But in many other cases we gotta ask ourselves \u201cIs this the person I\u2019m going to invest my heart into, and if so what do I need to do to help heal this situation?\u201d Everything I just mentioned can be overcome, and can help lead to stronger ties and deeper love.

It doesn\u2019t just happen. Like gardening, some seasons are good, some are bad, but experience helps learn how to maximize the good, and prepare for the bad. My lover and I have made some real mistakes. Bad ones. We learned from them, grew from them, adapted, and love each other more and more every year. I know we are going to mess up time and time again in the future, but I also know we are committed to each other and will work almost anything out. \n\nWe also have accepted that no matter what, we are going to be better and worst at different things, and it may not always be balanced. We don\u2019t try to add up each others pros and cons, because someone will always end up short. That should never be the basis of a relationship.\n\nIn the end, the real deal breakers are habitual violence, felonies, and thinking catapults are the superior siege weapon. Everything else is a challenge and part of life",

Or even that \\_\\_\\_ has to be fixed because it's hurting/messing with the poster. \\_\\_\\_\\_ could range from 'they always leave the toilet seat up' to 'they've locked my in my room with no way out after raping and beating me'. I always remind people that the relationship doesn't have to be toxic to feel like it's time to leave. You could have different ideas for what your futures should look like, live differently, absolutely want kids or absolutely don't. You could really be into travel and your partner is not. They could be looking for an open relationship and you're into monogamy and neither of you feels comfortable with being one or the other. Your partner could be extremely depressed and it's causing you to become depressed, and if you've tried approaching them and helping them, it's okay to call it quits. Of course the poster gets to choose whether or not the work is worth it, relationships do take work, but if you're spending that energy on someone and things aren't changing, they're not putting in the work, you're still unhappy, they don't have to be abusing you to say you're done.\n\nFor me personally, I try to:\n\n&gt;give well thought out explanations and advice that include the possibility of with-held information\n\nI try to give the person multiple solutions and how things could play out, I try to include ways they could be causing the situation,  I always try to keep in mind that I'm not getting the whole story, and they're still with that person because they want to be with them.  If the relationship is simply abuse, rarely (if ever) have I encouraged someone to stay. But if it's another issue such as the ones I've listed above, I give them the option of leaving. Sometimes people just need to hear it's okay to not be with someone for other reasons besides toxicity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We were in the time of \"Is this going somewhere? What exactly are we doing together?\" We never put our hearts on the line and in our case it led to extremely difficult times. We lost trust, we took breaks, we literally moved across country from one another and called it quits...\n\n... but then we looked into what our potential was and thought that just maybe if we gave a half of a shit, that we could be amazing.\n\nWe now have a beautiful baby girl and a bond I never would have thought because we forgave, communicated about where we fucked up, and where we could grow. We were just talking about this last night and both stated from the bottom of our hearts that it wasn't necessary, but it wasn't a death blow to our potential!\n\nBefore this relationship, I would be in the \"Leave now! Red flag, save yourselves precious time, money, and heartache.\" Now, I know it can absolutely work itself out as long as both parties can forgive and communicate. That's the hardest question to answer, and it took us moving away from each other to California and North Carolina without talking for 7 months before we realized how awesome we were together, and that we honestly, just needed to grow the fuck up.\n\nThere's plenty of times to ditch, but some people are worth fighting for!",

Hell maybe they're all real, and people just are that stupid, dense or evil to their partners, maybe people learn their relationship habits from TV and media (a lot of it perpetuates toxic ideas about the opposite sex) or maybe it was a random person who just wanted sympathy for random stories.

I feel like a big problem on this subreddit is we\u2019re only given one specific problem that someone has had with their SO and none of the background on how happy their relationship might be, or how many nice things their SO might have done. Sometimes leaving is the best thing to do but I think we tend to overstep when we tell people to end their relationships over (some of the) things on here. \n\nBasically, the relationship is entirely characterized by one person\u2019s account of the other person doing one thing. Honestly, I think it\u2019s kind of a disservice for us to advise people to leave in some of the posts because that\u2019s not very useful advise. Telling someone to leave is telling them not to try to understand their partner\u2019s actions which isn\u2019t very valuable in terms of relational competency growth. If we\u2019ve given OP advice that helps them reflect on their own actions and their partner\u2019s actions and they still leave there\u2019s nothing wrong with that and IMO the sub did some good, but when we jump to just leave we\u2019re robbing them of an opportunity for growth even if they should be leaving.

You will often get different advice if you go to someone who knows both people in a relationship vs someone who only knows you. Its easier to say \"What an asshole\" when you dont know the other person, or when you only hear negative things about the other person. If you know both people or you know the history, sometimes its like \"Yeah, that was wrong but I know you also do ABC or XYZ happened three years ago, so I can understand why they react like that\". \n\nSome of the best relationship advice I have gotten actually comes from my wife's friend (I mean, Im friends with her too, but she is more of my wife's friend). She knows us both, she knows our relationship, and she can be a lot more objective than if I were to talk to a family member or one of my friends.",

The cost:gain ratios aren't as clear cut as you make them out to be IMO.\n\nI think seeing leaving as the safest bet is one of the luxuries of youth. If you're 40 and have 10 years sunk into a relationship the loss from ending that association is monumental. Especially if marriage and children complicate the situation. If you're 27 and are 3 years deep it's a different ballgame.",

That\u2019s where you need to try to put what is best for YOU aside to focus on what\u2019s best for that person.\n\nI\u2019ve been cheated on in pretty much every relationship I\u2019ve been in. A couple I didn\u2019t have concrete proof of, but believe it happened for other reasons. This was likely due to what I saw growing up and the brand of narcissistic asshats I managed to keep choosing to date. Only in one case was it NOT a dealbreaker, and that was the first one. Engaged high school sweethearts, together 8 years. We decided on a \u201cbreak\u201d (yes, a la Ross and Rachel!) and he cheated at a party the night we agreed to it. He was drinking. Our relationship difficultly was due to getting together young and being unsure if we knew enough to decide this was it. He was honest immediately afterwards. \n\nMostly, though, he just wasn\u2019t that guy. It wasn\u2019t his nature and I still believe that. The others, no real shock, in hindsight. We resolved things, and when we eventually broke up, it wasn\u2019t because of that. He married the girl he dated after me. Now THAT fit with who he was. Definitely the marrying kind. I think breaking up because of the cheating would\u2019ve short-changed us. We had more to figure out and we did. Our split was mutual with no hard feelings, and while it was hard, we felt by then that we knew it was right. \n\nI do think the vast majority of cheaters aren\u2019t worth forgiving or staying with, and WILL do it again. I might not believe in exceptions had I not lived it. Now I do.",

Very often cheating occurs when one person is not holding up their end of the bargain in the marriage.  There are terrible people, and there are also people desperate for some kind of sign of love and care.  Sometimes a cheating situation is a wake-up call to a marriage.\n\nA dating relationship, outside of an engagement, in my opinion, shouldn't be held to the same standards.  Not as difficult to leave that.",

Ending that 32 year marriage showed me that I deserve to be with someone who loves and cherishes me, not someone I sunk time and money into. 15 years of misery is not noble. There is no honor in staying so someone doesn't have to be miserable alone. Love is work, absolutely, but not unlike work, if your job makes you utterly miserable and it isn't getting better, get a new job.\n\nI know I'm so glad I left the person I was with before my current significant other. I tried so hard to make that work, but one person can't fix a relationship. I was beating a dead horse for years. \n\nAnd now I'm so happy I left her! I have an amazing life with someone I trust and is considerate towards me.\n\nI don't think people are breaking up over fights about ice cream or what movie to watch or backseat driving. Often it is because of significant, chronic problems. \n\n",

It's that there is such a thing as coming back from cheating. Not being able to tolerate that possibility in *someone else's relationship* is damaging in itself.

My boyfriend of 1.5 years never does laundry or dishes, I have to do it for him. I always ask him to, and he never will, he never even tries to. Yesterday he told me I was nagging and to stop being a bitch.\"\n\nLeave. Leave now. A year and a half of non-effort culminating in sexist insults doubling down on his opinion that the SO should clean up after him.\n\nAlternatively,\n\n\"What do? My boyfriend gets home and lays down for an hour before he does chores. I keep asking him to do them right when he gets home, but he wants to \"decompress\" for a bit. He will do them, he always does, but I want them done earlier. Aita here?\"\n\nI mean probably. Maybe it ends up as NAH, but regardless, nobody needs to leave, they just need to talk it out and find compromise.\n\nHonestly you show your own sexism when you position the conversation around \"We'll it's a nagging girlfriend\", when in my experience most \"nagging\" SOs are just sick of mothering their partners. Real \"nagging\" is pretty rare from what I've seen, and I've participated in marriage counseling work.",

So by the nature of the upvote system, most judgements/advice that reach the top will be more about the popular sentiments found among the largest group of reddit users: young people. \n\nUpvotes themselves become a huge problem for any dissident opinions, not because people are necessarily karma farming but the psychological effect it has on your ability to discern between conflicting opinions that pushes and pushes until people are expressing the most watered down, agreeable and warped version of a position. \n\n \n\nThis is a comment thread several comments deep in a thread from earlier today that started reasonable but evolved into this absurdity:\n\n\\&gt;Also, you should never call a woman a bitch! Especially your fianc\u00e9. I would never disrespect my gf like that.\n\n\\&gt;&gt;Seriously. That is a HUGE red flag.\n\n \n\nI mean, I absolutely agree insulting your fiance or significant other is rude and immature and as part of a pattern of behaviour could be abusive, but to suggest that someone calling their fiance a bitch is by itself a red flag for abusive behaviour is just crazy. This sort of distortion as a thread unravels is very common and only undermines potentionally solid judgements.  Potentionally vulnerable and suggestive people using this sub in moments of crisis deserve better then the high school drama crap that comes with this sort of thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

How they communicate is important as well (eg speak calm, firm or yell, avoidant). We also don't know if the other partner knows about the \"offense\" they made towards their OP partner.

It *was* on this subreddit, and it was because OP had said \"No, I don't think this is a dealbreaker\" multiple times and the person wouldn't let it go.\n\nBut frankly, most of the time you see a suggestion to break up reach the top of a thread, it's because OP has indicated that their relationship has something *terrible* going on. Like, people are hitting one another, or making them cut off their family, or regularly telling one another that they are complete garbage. Those are also the posts that make it to the front pages, so people who sort by hot are exclusively seeing them and inferring that this answer is being applied to every post.\n\nAnd then of course you get the people who always show up (as I am sure they will show up in response to my post here) to say \"You can't tell from a Reddit post if somebody's relationship is healthy or not!\" and then start performing mental gymnastics about how a relationship might not necessarily be unhealthy if one partner is publicly stating that the other partner hits them.\n\nMy TL;DR here: If the reaction people are getting to reading a post is that OP should end their relationship, then that is a valid sentiment and not one that should be discarded under the assumption that nothing else has been tried. I am pretty fiercely opposed to u/cosmohumanist 's sentiment in this comment thread that OPs are unable to make their own decisions and thus shouldn't hear certain advice because they've been beaten down by consumerist society.",

It sounds obvious typed out like that, but people love to rationalize away the one awful thing because everything else is fine.\n\nOf course, the flip side is that there's the risk people will misidentify \"kind of bad, but can be worked through\" tier problems as orphan-murder-tier bad.

Also, we only see one side of the story here - hence it\u2019s logical that we are allowed and supposed to hand judgement BASING off that side. But it\u2019s one thing to say YTA/NTA on a specific scenario painted by the person posting, and another thing entirely to give life/relationship ADVICE based on it. \n\nI believe that actual advice on a relationship requires both sides of the story regarding conflict (obviously abusive stories don\u2019t require that. If the person is being abused or there are obvious red flags, sure, advice fits) and communication between the two involved in the relationship. \n\nOP isn\u2019t trying to \u201cgatekeep opinion\u201d, imo. The point they made is pretty valid if you think about it. No relationship is EVER going to be easy and problem free - and jumping out at first trouble might not always be the best advice one can give. \n\n",

But if your a teacher and your husband defends a 17 yo who just sexually harassed you yeah fuck that dude, that's not a slight flaw that's a major issue and a precursor for how he will treat you forever.  If a guy and his wife have been talking about divorce, sleeping on couches, etc for years then it's probably time to give up the charade.    \n\n\nIt's ok to admit that things didn't work.

The post *itself* is a huge red flag and, regardless of who the asshole actually is, the trust is clearly broken in the relationship and OP should move on. \n\nClearly this is a generalization, but seems like it might be the case in many instances. \n\n",

I won\u2019t pretend that doesn\u2019t color my responses. But there is also a lot of truth to the old saying \u201cno good marriage ever ended in divorce\u201d. Once the marriage or relationship gets to the point where hurting the other person, or maintaining the shitty status quo is more important than the love and commitment that either party feels...it\u2019s no longer good. \n\nPersonal growth isn\u2019t isolated to relationships, either. I learned a hell of a lot from a marriage that went south:  what I can and cannot live with, a firm belief in respecting and honoring your partner\u2019s feelings and opinions, and much less patience for bullshit. It has all served me very well as I\u2019ve gotten older. \n\nThe major lesson has been that it\u2019s OKAY to let go of things that hurt me and make me unhappy. I don\u2019t have time for things like that anymore. \n\n",

Sometimes it can accommodate a change of roles, like co-parenting or downscaling to friendship without kids. \n\nIt's also empowering to see people be able to acknowledge they love each other, but they aren't treating each other well.

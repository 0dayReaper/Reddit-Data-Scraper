            "comment": "Appreciate the semi-regular updates Senator. You've by far the most active legislator across multiple platforms I've seen (at least for NC); I'm very glad you've taken time out of a busy life (especially now) to update people. A few Duke-centric questions. \n\nOne, why the funds to private colleges? Obviously as a Duke student (alum? not sure how this works without a physical graduation), I'm not against private colleges getting more money, but it seems weird in this case that public funds are being given out to private organizations. \n\nTwo, is the university considered separate from the research side for Duke. Like does the funding for the vaccine institute count as funds given to a private college? More broadly, do any of the categories you've mentioned overlap?",

They commit egregious acts of genocide, and they will quickly silence dissent. That\u2019s why people are so quick to apologize to the Chinese government with such flowery language.",

Most of the people in Taiwan do not take themselves to be Chinese (in terms of nationality), while the overwhelming majority of the Tibetan agree that Tibet is part of China. There is no question here. I guess the China-bad rhetoric has been taken too far in many fronts.\n\nAlso the Dalai Lama is a factor too. But considering he was the leader of the theocratic medieval country that Tibet was pre-CCP, who was forced to flee afterwards, it is no wonder that he is constantly touting Tibet independence. He did a great job sugarcoating what he really was, though.",

It had a bunch of spelling typos and the choice to include Tibet in the sentence while still missing other major regions that celebrate Lunar New Year (e.g. Singapore) makes it seem like it was an admin trying to list the first few different Asian regions off the top of their head. Technically Tibet is officially under China rule right now, unfortunately so, but I can see why some Chinese students would be sensitive to this matter. It\u2019s just easier for admin to follow up with a correction like this, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s censorship when it\u2019s kind of apparent this admin is ignorant on certain matters.",

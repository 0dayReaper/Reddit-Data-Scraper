I would totally agree Allen has a better handle than JJ.",

Allen wasn't ready to play more than 8 per game until late in the year. He wouldn't have put up those numbers if he were playing 32 minutes. All that said, Grayson is going to be so much fun to watch these next three years, just like he was late in this year.",

JJ had to step up, Allen never did bad coming off the bench.\n\nHe either slipped in an got a three or even some none tangible hustle play. Some times he came in and played his role and nothing too amazing but I never remember him coming in and being a detriment to the team.\n\nHard to say \"What if's\" in any direction comparing him to JJ but given his limited time he has done really well and I don't see how anyone can discount him in anyway.  Other than Tyus, I can't think of another player who steps up more when the rest of the team is struggling.",

I hope he becomes a dominant player.\n\nBut JJ was one of the best who ever played at Duke and a Wooden Award winner in a similar time with tons of one-and-done players (e.g., Luol Deng)...also got significantly better every year from that freshman season (just like he is currently doing in the NBA). \n\nHopefully Grayson can do something similar, but it's a lot to expect.\n",

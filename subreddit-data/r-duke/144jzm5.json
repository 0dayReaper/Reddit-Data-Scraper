It looks like a glass box at the front. When you enter it, you are already on the second floor, and you will see several food stands. I think 8 are open this summer during lunch, and 2-3 of them are lunch only. IMO, the most cost-effective options are Sazon (Mexican rice bowl) and the Indian food (sorry I forget the name). The average cost is around $12 at these two places, and I believe they still have some daily special deals, which are about $5 (economic options).\n\nOf course, you can also explore by yourself, and see which one you'd like to try. Oh, there is also a Panera Sandwich on the 1st floor, but no restaurant on the 3rd floor yet.\n\nEnjoy your visit!",

The FAA doesn't really care about the drone unless it's high enough to be at plane/copter elevation. Duke, however, cares a lot about random drones flying around campus (this was the case both before and after the Window Drone Incident of 2016) so the permit is more for Duke's sake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a side note, before this particular drone became stuck in a 3rd story window, its pilots also managed to get it stuck in a tree. I also have footage of a pilot flying the drone directly at himself and having to jump out of the way in panic.",

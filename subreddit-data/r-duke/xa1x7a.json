At no point did they call her a liar or reject the possibility that the incident still happened. They welcomed anyone with more evidence to come forward. I like Nina King a lot when weve spoken and it\u2019s hard to blame her. She faces no easy decisions. But her statement was unfair to BYU.",

If her words were not in reference to BYU specifically, then it was an odd statement to make.

I wouldn't bother preparing more than one piece. Auditions are 10 minutes long and that includes both the sight-reading (they will just ask you to read like 8 measures just to confirm that you can actually sight-read) and questions (so they can get to know you a little) so they will cut you off if your pieces combined are more than \\~7-8 minutes long.",

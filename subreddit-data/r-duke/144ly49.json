Meet with them and explain why you want to do 1 semester, there are plenty of valid reasons you may have that they\u2019ll understand. If you do that and request it very early on (I.e. fall junior year or earlier) there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019ll be approved. Then you just take 6 masters courses in undergrad (which may take overloading depending on your situation).",

I can bridge you with him if you'd like to ask more specific questions. Just DM me on Reddit at your convenience. Cheers!",

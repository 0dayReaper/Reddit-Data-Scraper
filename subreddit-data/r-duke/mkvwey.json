I'm pretty sure when I was accepted it was the first time it was below 10% (actually yep, just went and checked [here](https://today.duke.edu/2013/04/regulardecisionnotify-13) and remembered correctly). To think that 8 years later it's less than half of that is pretty crazy. Really makes me wonder if it'll just continue on this trend forever (along with those annual tuition hikes) or if things will burst at some point.",

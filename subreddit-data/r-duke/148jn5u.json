    "postText": "Hey everyone. Rising junior here. I\u2019ve been struggling to land a SWE internship in the US. I\u2019m an international and couldn\u2019t get one in the US, so I\u2019m doing one in my home country in Europe.\n\nI went to TechConnect, which I don\u2019t think was really that helpful. Felt superficial almost. For summer 2023 I applied to maybe 400 companies last recruiting cycle and couldn\u2019t land one in the US. I know the first internship is tough to get, and being international makes it tougher, but I\u2019m trying to prepare for my 2024 recruiting now that I got my first one. I\u2019ve been grinding at LeetCode and think my resume is decent with good projects.\n\nWhen I scour this subreddit at previous questions on SWE recruiting, it really seems like people are talking too highly of the general experience in recruiting success. Perhaps I\u2019m pessimistic from my experience, but I was wondering if anyone who had recruited in the recent years could share their authentic experience and tips. Has internationals from Duke faired well with recruiting for internships/new grad positions in this economy? Even if you\u2019re not international, what\u2019s your SWE recruiting experience and do you have any tips? On a whole, it seems that lots of cs majors and internationals are doing terribly in this market, but I\u2019m looking for some insights into how it is from Duke.\n\nI\u2019m just worried I spent so much money on a college degree here in the states just to get paid a lot less if I\u2019m deported back to my home country.",

            "comment": "Not a recent grad but I have 2 thoughts. First it will probably be much easier to get an internship as a rising senior because companies want to convert interns to full-time hires AND you'll have an internship on your resume. Second, it seems that the job market is recovering, at least at my company.",

Wouldn\u2019t I be just applying for a full time position when I\u2019m a rising senior, i.e. the summer after junior year? Thank you for responding by the way.",

I was also on the third floor and feel(personally lol) like I got the worst dorm in the building. To be fair I was in the corner which made for an awkward floor plan and horribly sloped ceilings but unless your in room 311 you don\u2019t have to worry about that XD also a heads up that there\u2019s no elevator in brown but fortunately the OLs move your stuff up. I don\u2019t know if this is true or not but I\u2019ve heard you can email housing requesting room dimensions/details so that might be worth a shot.",

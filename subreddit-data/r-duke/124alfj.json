    "postText": "It\u2019s my senior year and I haven\u2019t been to a lecture in weeks. I lie to my family and they thinks everything is going great. I haven\u2019t hung out with a single friend since the beginning of last semester. I\u2019m severely depressed, doing the worst in my classes I\u2019ve ever been, don\u2019t have grad photos or cap and gown, not reading or replying to emails and not accepted to a single post-grad program. I love spending my whole day in my apt. Drinking and self pity thinking of how I wasted so many opportunities the last 4 years. None of this is dukes fault just hate myself and want to rant. Atleast I\u2019m graduating and can go home soon go blue devils",

Easier said than done, I know, but this is temporary. Limp over the finish line, graduate, hopefully get renewed at home and get together a new, manageable game plan. \n\nI genuinely wish you the best. Also, as someone who has struggled with depression all my life, I strongly recommend therapy. It's not a quick fix thing, but it does help to identify and deal with shit. And please, if you get to a completely hopeless point, please reach out to someone for help.",

I squandered my fair share of opportunities while at Duke both academically and socially, but you really can\u2019t shame yourself over past mistakes. Keep your head up and a short memory. It does get better.",

Like clean up one area on your desk. Or walk to one class. One that is at an easy time slot. You don\u2019t even have to promise yourself to go in. Just promise yourself you will walk there and then decide what to do and be okay if that is just walking back home. Just commit to that one thing every day. Anything that happens after that is a bonus. \n\nBeating yourself up doesn\u2019t make things any better. Get\ncounseling and be honest with them. you may need medications but all of that is okay and none of it has to be forever. Drinking doesn\u2019t help and it\u2019s an attempt at self medication so why not get some real medication instead? \n\nYour family and friends will eventually understand and those that don\u2019t aren\u2019t worth your time. \n\nTalk to yourself like you would talk to your best friend when they are feeling down. \n\nTake time off if you need it.",

It's all about building momentum as soon as you get up. I hope that you build enough momentum to find leaving the house more doable. Try your level best to replace 1 negative with 2 positives for what I learned as the \"net gain rule\". They don't have to be huge commitments like running a 10k or building a robot. \n\nBaby Steps. Take care of the environment around you, and it in turn will do its bit. Last but certainly the most important (personal opinion), Duke CAPS is a gem. Only after I left Duke did I realize how insane it is to have free access to a facility like that. I hope you feel better very soon and congratulations on graduating soon. You deserve to be celebrated.",

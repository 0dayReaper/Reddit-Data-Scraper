            "comment": "Duke vs UC Berkeley (as a incoming sophomore transfer)\n\n**Background:** Hi everyone! Still trying to make up my mind and could use some help (convincing). I want to study biology (not pre-med), and go into research and graduate studies. Honestly, I mostly need convincing on the biology program at Duke. Also, how easy is it to double major at Duke? (Debating a second stats/CS/something? major). I'm an international student (Asian), so not concerned financially either way. \n\n**Duke**: \n\n*Pros:*\n\n\\- private uni: smaller classes, easier access to profs, more intimate\n\n\\- marine lab! always wanted to study marine biology\n\n\\- guaranteed on-campus housing (though I've already found off-campus housing for Cal)\n\n\\- better funding for research/service (trips) like FOCUS or DukeEngage\n\n\\- Dining services are good, I hear!\n\n\\- duke is much safer than Cal\n\n*Concerns/Cons:*\n\n\\- not interested in greek life\n\n\\- not super into basketball, more of a volleyball gal and PAC-12 is on the west coast (if anyone has anything to say about intramural volleyball or duke volleyball games, I'd love to hear it!)\n\n\\- foreign language requirement at Duke vs waived at Cal \n\n\\- older sibling went to Duke, call me petty but it's not appealing to go somewhere they went\n\n**Berkeley**:\n\n*Pros*:\n\n\\- Berkeley has their own natural history museums (large collections of specimens), where I worked in spring (worried there isn't anything very similar at Duke)\n\n\\- kinda in the city, downtown is close, really good (Asian) food all around\n\n\\- Berkeley is ranked higher in Biology than Duke, biology programs and classes are good\n\n\\- already have a base at Cal, won't be behind academically (vs behind at Duke w/ core and major requirements)\n\n*Cons*:\n\n\\- area is so so sketchy, it's pretty unsafe (sirens 24/7 basically)\n\n\\- off-campus housing after 1st year\n\n\\- Cal kinda suck at sports\n\n\\- huge student body, students are pretty intense (lowkey cutthroat, very worried about grades/clubs/internships, very competitive)\n\n\\- admin/advisor stuff is terrible",

I am currently committed to Duke, and I\u2019m wondering what your opinion is on the two schools. I\u2019m personally pretty torn as of now. What are reasons to stay committed to Duke? What would be reasons not to? What are some caveats if I do choose to go? And what are some tips for succeeding at Duke? For some extra information, I want to study CS/Econ/business and want to ultimately work my way to management at a tech firm or startup. I have visited Penn\u2019s campus, and I honestly prefer Duke\u2019s greener, more expansive environment. Thanks a ton for reading!",

From what I've heard from friends at Penn, Penn CAS might not had all of the opportunities that someone from Wharton had (or recruiters prefer Wharton grads). The schools are very similar academically, so I'd focus on what you want to get out of school in terms of culture, where to spend 4 years, financial aid, etc.",

                    "comment": "Penn v. Duke is the most splitting hair battle, but so many students end up making this decision when choosing colleges (and I think its a 50-50 split statistically). \n\nThat being said, taking into account the physical and social space is important. So the fact that you prefer Duke\u2019s more green space should be taken into account. I know a minor thing between the two schools that personally drove me to Duke was that dorm\u2019s will be smaller, so better for community building. At Penn, there were dorms that were literal skyscrappers and I could feel the disconnectedness on campus. \n\nI also think that Duke cares for its students in ways that I would say Penn doesn\u2019t (Duke is willing to listen to student output and voice). It\u2019s less competitive (my friends in and outside of Wharton complain about competition at Penn, but at Duke it\u2019s not so much). Recruitment at big companies/firms is frequent, and there is a lot of spirit around being a blue devil. I would also say Duke advocates for more academic exploration (and i say this thinking Duke could do more on this regard), but generally they want students to explore and give them multiple avenues to do so. \n\nThen of course you have Duke-specific programs like DukeEngage (which is touted a lot so i assume you know it), but also CS+ or Code+ or data+ which are programs over the summer that enhance your data science/CS skills and allows you to develop your own project\u2014 and having interviewed myself for a big tech company (albeit for a marketing position) they will ask you a lot of questions about projects you\u2019ve done, about how you learned x skill, and I think Duke builds your resume for you. \n\nI can speak more at length for Duke V. Penn, both are great in their own right. That being said, remember to take all opinions with a grain of salt because students from Penn will advocate for Penn, and Duke for Duke \u2014 but the programs I mentioned and the physical/social space you interact in, those are fact. Personally, I think Duke is superior in this regard.",

There was a week this year where it went from literally snowing at the beginning of the week to 70 degrees at the end of the week. There will be clear skies in the morning and a literal downpour in the afternoon. I once found a desk to work at in Twinnies, next to the glass. It was raining outside. The sun was still bright and in my eyes.\n\n\nI got used to the weather pretty quickly, but my #1 con for Duke/Durham is the fucking pollen. There are at least two weeks a year where I stay inside as much as possible to save my eyes and nose. When it rains in the spring, you can see yellow tree jizz in the water runoff, on windows, on your clothes, literally everywhere. There have been aerial pictures taken of Durham where the air above the city is tinted yellow - not because smog, or fires, or anything else, but because there really is that much pollen in the air.\n\n\nJust scaring you a little for funsies but for real don't underestimate Durham weather :P",

It seems it would be stressful and won't offer the academic flexibility and diversity you want.\n\nI'll just say a few things about your other options. UChicago is a great school, no doubt about it. Hyde Park itself is a pretty safe area, but of course you shouldn't go wandering off too much. For that matter, Durham isn't renowned for its safety. UChicago has quite the nerdy reputation - there's a reason people say it's \"where fun goes to die.\" No comments about Core specifically, but Duke also has T-reqs (like distribution requirements) that are a source of consternation to many people. Chicago is a much bigger place than Hanover or Durham, and if the cosmopolitan lifestyle is important to you (shopping, restaurants, museums are definitely more available in Chicago, and more so in Durham than in Hanover) and would play a big role in your life outside class, that's important to consider. On that note, if you think rural, small town New England (which can be very beautiful and has plenty of charms) is going to be boring and uncomfortable for you, Dartmouth might not be the right choice.\n\nDuke does offer a lot of the \"pros\" you named for other schools. The Career Center has summer internship funding for unpaid internships, and if you're willing to branch out you can certainly build a very comprehensive liberal arts base. The alumni network is very strong in many fields. One big advantage over Dartmouth is that Duke does leading research in a number of subjects, which is something you can get involved in even as an undergrad. The econ department doesn't quite have UChicago's academic reputation but [it does well in several outcomes-focused rankings](https://econ.duke.edu/news/duke-reclaims-title-best-school-us-economics). Basketball and Greek life are definitely not things you have to do if you don't want to. I've gone to one game in four years and I live in an independent house, and I don't feel out of place at all. It's a big place, and your own decisions are going to play a big role in shaping your experience.\n\nOf course you posted in the Duke sub so these responses are going to lean towards Duke. But those are my thoughts.",

Graduate programs aren't really directly comparable to undergrad either, unless your express object is to conduct lots of high powered research as an undergrad.\n\nThat infamous CC post is far overblown imo. Yes there is talk about the social hierarchy and stratification at Duke, but your \"status\" in no way prevents you from making good friends you can relate to. If some snob wants to flex their standing, just don't associate with them. Their loss. None of my friends could care less about this and just go about living their merry lives. If you have more questions about social life at Duke, feel free to DM me.\n\nJudging by your post history, I assume you're from Singapore? Yes, Duke is very far from Singapore, and it will likely be harder to find things that exactly remind you of home in Durham than in LA. (For that matter, be aware that UCLA and USC are in very different parts of LA - UCLA is in a really nice area, whereas USC is in a much grittier area closer to the city center.) Remember though that everywhere in the US is at least almost 20 hours from Singapore, direct flight or not. Duke has a fairly active Singapore Students Association, and there are several Asian markets in the area (Li Ming's, H Mart, and Grand Asia, among others). Again, if you have any questions about living here, feel free to ask.",

Lab work requires time, and you don't want to spend half of the time that you could be working in the lab in traffic. \n\nI don't know why people want to go to a school that has a reputation for giving out easier grades, and I'm not sure why Duke wants to perpetuate that reputation (I don't think we do).

Duke's average education exceeds both those schools. 2) Duke's campus is vastly superior. Its prettier in general and like 10x larger than both of the other two combined. I will say when I toured both Georgia Tech and Duke this was a major factor in tipping me towards Duke. 3) Duke has far more connections you can make. Duke is just the more prestigious school. You might come out with a slightly worse engineering education, but I think your job prospects look similar. 4) You'll definitely have a better general education. Even engineering majors take non-engineering classes.

Social hierarchy only exists if you choose to enter it - like you can go your entire 4 years at Duke without going to a frat party (case in point - me).",

I'm from Boston and was in a couple of professional shows, my high school shows, my high school chorus, and an elite youth chorus at NEC.\n\nDespite what I had heard about the emphasis on the arts: Duke's only theatre group (Hoof n Horn) is student led and not very professional, and Duke Chorale is trash. My only outlet for arts is acapella (absolutely love my group) and it has been an awesome experience.\n\nMaybe I was spoiled in high school but I swear my public school chorus and musical theatre productions were better than Duke's.\n\nAlso took singing lessons for course credit at Duke: worst mistake of my freshman year. They make you write essays and the actual voice training was utter trash\n\nIf you want to go into arts, DO NOT GO TO DUKE. If you don't want to PLEASE COME, Duke is my favorite place on earth and I could not be happier there, despite the disappointing arts",

I'm not sure what I want to study in college, but I'm really good at STEM stuff, and I thought the CS classes in high school weren't bad...my major could change though.\n\nDuke Pros: \n- Closer to home, around 4 ish hour drive\n\n- Good academically\n\n- Higher ranking (parents care way more than I do about this)\n\n- I have a friend who goes there, and he says I would love it there.

I was really, really happy here at Duke this year, hands down the right decision. One of my really good friends ended up going to Cornell and he liked it there, but it definitely sounded like there was more to do at Duke. In terms of Greek life and frats, Duke is much more tame than other schools. Last year there was that kid who died and they found him in the gorge after a frat part and the frat brothers covered it up. From what my friends in sororities said, really not a lot of hazing at all but I can\u2019t speak on that for the frats. One of my teammates does CS and the program at Duke is very elite and definitely growing. Intro classes will have a lot of kids, but as you continue classes get exponentially smaller. Also, you\u2019re not forced to live on campus 3 years. Sophomores can move to the Swift Apartment complexes which are about 10 minutes away, but there is free bussing to them. You have to wait 3 years to get a real house or farther apartment, however. I live close to Ithaca and the weather here can be depressing for sure. Duke was really really great weather wise and made it was better for sports. And don\u2019t worry about the culture being the same just because its closer (4-5 hours really isn\u2019t that close) because Duke is kind of like its own bubble. There\u2019s kids from all 50 states + international students from all over the world, so it\u2019s really nothing like the surrounding area. Academics at Duke and Cornell are very prestigious, but from what I can gather from my experience and hearing my friend talk about it, Duke is much more manageable and we have a LOT of resources for students, you just have to take advantage of them (office hours, free tutoring, study rooms, etc.). The social scene is really phenomenal and the kids who come here are great. There\u2019s really an awesome school spirit and pride. Finally, yes, the food is damn good. Both Cornell and Duke are great schools, but personally, I\u2019ve been thankful every day in my decision and am glad I chose Duke over Cornell.",

                    "comment": "So funny enough I actually ended up picking Duke out of a bunch of schools, two of which USC and UC Berkeley. I can provide my take on why I ended up taking Duke (with some added perspective now that I've been here for almost 4 years). Obviously I'm biased but here goes:\n\n\nUC Berkeley is a large school - to put this in perspective, there will be more students in UC Berkeley's incoming class of 2024 than there are undergraduate students at Duke. This means that teaching resources tend to be limited, and opportunities for things like research tend to be more limited, and you'll find yourself fighting with other people for those things. Berkeley also pigeonholes you into a major almost from the get-go and it's pretty difficult to change your mind.\n\n\nUSC - It was harder for me to turn down USC than it was to turn down UC Berkeley (for context they also gave me Presidential Scholar) - I think the same pro's you're listing for USC also apply to Duke (in fact, I might venture to say that they're probably even more prominent at Duke). The area surrounding USC definitely sucks and I also agree that it's probably not as strong as Duke or UC Berkeley if you're pursuing grad school, although that's more speculation than anything. Not sure about their social scene.\n\n\nDuke has several things that are harder to find at a university - lots of compassionate and helpful people, lots of academic freedom, and lots of opportunities for other things. There is little pressure to compete against others and people are encouraged to work together. Lots of opportunities for clubs/research/whatever and people are in general super friendly. It's pretty easy to switch majors/schools as long as you're on track to graduate, and also pretty easy to tack on a minor. The other two commenters have mentioned the social scene being pretty chill, and I agree (I swear every incoming student hears these rumors about the Duke social scene...not sure where they originate lmao).\n\n\nThat's about all I have to say but they're all good schools so you'll probably be well off no matter which one you pick.",

I was similarly sketched out when I first heard of Durham, but once getting to campus and seeing it over the past few years, I have no major worries. If you venture off a few miles from campus it can get \u201csketchy\u201d in certain areas, but you really have no need to ever go there and the areas close to campus are all pretty nice and safe. \n\nFor social life, I\u2019d say it\u2019s what you want to make of it. If you want to party pretty frequently, there are some Greek orgs that offer that option. If you just want to drink with some friends and don\u2019t want the whole stereotypical Greek experience, there are some Greek orgs, Selective Living Groups and non-affiliated groups of friends that offer those options. \n\nBasketball culture is a lot of fun, and things like K-Ville are also a great way to get a social scene without traditional fraternities.",

There's plenty of room to 'opt out' from it, especially because rush doesn't happen until second semester, and first semester freshman aren't supposed to be recruited. SLGs and LLCs are a popular option for people to rush instead - some are more like Greek life, others are special-interest groups around a certain theme or interest, still others are basically large friend groups who live together. You'll meet people at Duke who don't go to a single party in four years, and people who are functional alcoholics, and everything in between. It's probably important to note that even the most avid partiers also tend to be hardworking students - because Duke is hard, and requires us to work.\n\n2) Students at every top tier school are super stressed / burned out / depressed. You'd see it at Northwestern too. You'd see it in even higher rates in pressure cooker environments in certain majors or programs elsewhere. It's just another reality of college.\n\n3) Durham is lovely. Anyone who calls it sketchy should be side-eyed - that attitude probably says more about their own prejudices than the reality of what the city's like. It's working class, with a large and vibrant black community. Amazing food scene for a city of its size. If you're coming from a small town, you'll find it big; if you're coming from a major city, it's pretty quaint. Only real drawback is that Duke's main campus is quite far from downtown - we're in the middle of a forest - so it's not exactly walkable. But if you're interested in engaging with Durham as a car-less first year, there's plenty of classes and programs that take you into the community.\n\nAdditional info - neuroscience is a very popular and well-regarded program here, so you'd be in good company. Check out the [Cognitive Neuroscience and Law](https://focus.duke.edu/clusters-courses/cognitive-neuroscience-and-law) first year FOCUS and see if that appeals to you - the professor who heads it is truly incredible.",

I\u2019ve found that is generally the case with urban vs \u201cenclosed\u201d campuses. \n\nBoth are probably about the same in terms of quality of research and availability of research. Both have large hospital systems and a big medical school that help drive a lot of the high quality BME research that is done at both institutions. Philly being a bigger city, you might have more access to patients if you\u2019re interested in being part of clinical work. There are a lot of undergrads working in labs at both schools and it is pretty to get a research position in a lab at either - you just have to ask. \n\nI think you really can\u2019t go wrong with either, especially choosing between two great BME programs. You might want to get more information from undergrads who went to both schools, but also consider the type of environment where you want to be living (big city urban campus vs small town suburban/rural campus) and what you would thrive in better.",

It\u2019s not worth going $250k in debt to get a degree from Duke (or any school for that matter). I think that too many people think of college as a means to an end - getting a good job. As you said there are plenty of ways to get a job without going to college. \n\nHowever, those who are getting admitted to Duke as undergrads are probably either well off enough to have their parents support them or aren\u2019t, and are able to get generous financial aid from the school. And for people who can afford it through either of these means, college does have tremendous intangible value, especially at a prestigious institution. Interacting with people of different backgrounds and gaining perspectives from similarly curious and intelligent people really broadens your worldview and shapes your viewpoints at this critical stage in your life, and college is one of the few places that surrounds you with such diverse people. It\u2019s a place where you learn to try new things and figure out what you like and dislike. I graduated from college with a degree that I know will never directly translate to whatever job I get (once I\u2019m done with my PhD), but I still think it was absolutely worth it given the experiences I was able to have.",

I've never got that vibe at Duke, but I do know a few students who'd probably fit that bill.\n\nJust curious, did you enjoy your experience at Rutgers? Living on campus at Duke, making friends, performing in a music group, and participating in a design-based club has made my time here very memorable and worth it; I feel like if you had a bad undergrad experience at Rutgers it might have soured your view of the undergrad experience in general.",

It\u2019s pretty pre-professional, so if you are interested in finance or consulting many top companies come to campus and that is where most econ majors end up. MMS certificate is also a great way to get classes that focus more on \u201cbusiness\u201d and less on economics, but many of the econ electives are pretty interesting and are real-world relatable as well.",

Companies come all the time to present, hold workshops, talks, networking sessions, etc. Innovation and entrepreneurship is an entire certificate and department with a lot of professors \u201cof the practice\u201d who spent decades at companies like P&amp;G. There\u2019s incubators, maker spaces and grant funding for entrepreneurship opportunities. Sanford is the school of public policy and it\u2019s super easy to get involved whether it be through research with professors, in the reporter\u2019s lab or going to discussion/talks/events with political figures. There\u2019s an American Grand Strategy group that goes on trips across the US and internationally, an Alexander Hamilton society, POLIS for current politics, whatever you\u2019re interested in, I\u2019m sure they have it.\n\nCurrently majoring in economics and it\u2019s pretty good. If you\u2019re interested in finance, we have some of the best professors in financial economics. Not as certain about a language. Science is pretty popular here since there are so many premeds, so biology or chemistry is a good bet. Physics isn\u2019t as popular, it\u2019s a smaller major since it\u2019s notoriously difficult.\n\nSocial life is pretty diverse. There\u2019s always events (like dance showcases or fairs or trivia nights) happening around campus that you can go to with friends if you\u2019re not into the party scene. If you are, Wed-Sat, there\u2019s stuff happening. \n\nHope that helped for Duke, lmk if you have more questions (:",

    "postText": "This is possibly the most illogical thing I have ever experienced.\n\nI have a Swift parking permit but my research lab is in LSRC. For sake of convenience, I parked in the visitor lot of Duke hospital, because my permit does not allow me to park anywhere on west campus. I was paying the regular visitor price, but I was ticketed and told I can\u2019t park there because it is \u201cvisitors only\u201d, and me having a permit means I am not a visitor.\n\nI called Duke parking multiple times and the lady kept repeating the above logic of why I can\u2019t park anywhere even if I pay extra, because I have a permit. I wish to hear opinions from everyone on this.",

            "comment": "Their logic is that you already have a place to park on campus, so you should park there regardless of where you're going (even if it's super far from where you need to be). And you are taking spots from visitors by going in visitor spaces. I suppose if the lot filled with Duke employees, folks visiting would have no where to go. Not saying I agree but that's their perspective.\n\n I know this is a thing so have always removed my permit before parking in the Duke Hospital lot. Have only parked there when I had a doctors appt at one of the clinics and didn't walk over.",

Put your tag in something that will block that.  I usually put mine in center storage that most cars have, that block's enough.  As a person that has worked higher Ed most of my life, I have always hated that we have to pay for parking and I find the Duke tickets to be more expensive than they should be.",

In the past, I've done that with another permit and never been ticketed, but they may have just decided to start doing this. \n\nThen again, Parking and Transportation once tried giving me a ticket for having the wrong permit for my lot despite the signs leading into it all stating the permit I have was required. Fortunately, a coworker called to point out that they had ticketed a whole lot with incorrect tickets because they didn't bother to read.\n\nAlso, if you were going to an appointment or visiting someone in the hospital, you can't be expected to park at Swift and walk over.",

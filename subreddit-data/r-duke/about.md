Description:

Welcome to the Duke University subreddit! Here you can find discussion of anything Duke-related - sports, academics, activities, anything! Tell your friends!

Rules:

Be Respectful &amp; Civil: No bullying, harrassment, doxxing, vitriol, etc. Being on an online forum does not give you permission to be a petulant human being.

If you make a throwaway account to skirt this rule, that account will be banned.

No Low-Effort Posts: All posts must be related to Duke.

If it can be answered by a google search (eg. "What's Duke's acceptance rate?") it doesn't belong here.

Spam posts and comments will be removed. Repeated spamming will get your account removed from this subreddit. Making a fresh account to continue spamming won't work.

Brigading the subreddit is not allowed.

Trying to weasel your way into a basketball game because you don't want to sleep in a tent is not allowed. Helping someone do so not allowed.

Admissions-Related Content: This sub is not for prospective Duke applicants trying to assess their academic competitiveness. "Chance me" content or similar will be removed. Repeat offenses will lead to a ban.

In addition, please put admissions-related questions  in the admissions megathread. Posting about admissions outside of the megathread will get your post removed.

GTHC: Self-explanatory. Any post that attempts to extol the nonexistent virtues of holes containing dark, viscous liquids, or that paints the University with No Competency in any positive light, will be removed.

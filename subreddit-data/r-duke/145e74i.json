You certainly don't need to take anything lower than CS 101 at Duke regardless of the situation imo (especially if you want to major in CS). I would recommend looking up the syllabus for 201, prolly enrolling in that over 101 to start if the syllabus looks ok, and seeing how it goes. If you're familiar with basic Java and OOP, you should be ok",

    "postText": "HERE\u2019S THE VACCINE SITUATION IN NORTH CAROLINA\n \nThis week, North Carolina got 85,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine.\n \nNext week, that will drop to 60,000.\n \nSome of you saw the headlines about Pfizer vaccine shipments being reduced, for reasons that are still unclear. That appears to have happened across the board. So, while we were originally expecting to get another 85,000 Pfizer doses, now it looks closer to 60,000.\n \nBut that doesn\u2019t apply to the Moderna vaccine. \n \nNext week, our state will be getting 175,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine - which just became FDA-approved last night, so we now officially have two vaccines.\n\nBoth vaccines need to be administered with a first and second shot. The shots must be 21 days apart for Pfizer and 28 days apart for Moderna. \n \nYou cannot mix a Pfizer with a Moderna vaccination - you need two doses of the same kind.  \n \nThese estimates are very rough, but it\u2019s safe to say that within the next six weeks North Carolina will be getting hundreds of thousands (but likely not millions) of doses.\n \nBut, keep in mind, everyone needs two doses. So, for example, if we get one million doses by the end of January, that means 500,000 immunizations. \n \nFor context, that\u2019s less than 5% of our state.\n\nMany sources, including Dr. Fauci, say that herd immunity kicks in once 75 to 85% of the population is immunized. However, he says that once 50% of the population is immunized we should start to see an effect on slowing community spread.\n \nAt this point, it\u2019s safe to say that it will be many months before we hit 50%. \n \nWe may very well end up with much more supply than the current rate, but that\u2019s less likely to happen in the next couple months than in the months that follow. Dr. Fauci, for instance, says we should have greater supply starting in late March or early April.\n \nThat means that for purposes of controlling the overall rate of infection for the next few months - *which will be crucial* - the vaccine may not be a major counterweight. \n\nHERE\u2019S WHERE THE VACCINES ARE HEADING WITHIN OUR STATE RIGHT NOW\n \nFirst, we\u2019re shipping to all the hospitals. We have 116 hospitals in our state. In the first week, we only had enough vaccine to ship to 53 of them, and some of them only received a small number of vaccines.\n \nThe 53 hospitals that were chosen for the first shipment all have ultra-cold freezers. Novant, for example, had to quickly buy roughly 20 new sub-zero freezers in order to receive the shipment.\n \nOnce the vaccines are unloaded from their ultra-cold delivery box, they must be moved into a freezer within five minutes.\n \nDue to how the vaccine is packaged, the smallest number of Pfizer vaccines that a hospital can receive is 975. You can\u2019t sub-divide that number due to packaging.\n\nThe Moderna vaccine is different. It doesn\u2019t require ultra-cold storage, just regular freezer storage. That means it can ship in batches of 100. While supplies are still scarce, this makes the Moderna vaccine more well-suited for rural hospitals and smaller providers.\n \n*Important Note*: Nursing home distribution works differently.\n \nThe federal government wanted to give states some flexibility in deciding where vaccines would go *except* when it comes to nursing homes, which they wanted to ensure were a priority.\n \nThey also wanted to make sure that the administration of the vaccine in nursing homes was handled with particular care.\n \nSo the approach they came up with was to contract with Walgreens and CVS to use their medical staff to administer the vaccine to nursing homes.\n\nAnd the deal is the federal government will pay for that *as long as* your state allocates at least 50% of the Moderna vaccine to nursing homes. \n \nNorth Carolina has complied with that, so nursing homes will have the benefit of a large number of trained medical staff on site to handle vaccine administration.\n \nThis does not, however, apply to all forms of long-term care facilities. Right now, this is specifically for nursing homes due to their highly elevated risk.\n \n \nHERE\u2019S HOW THE PHASES WORK (I.E., \u201cYOUR PLACE IN LINE\u201d)\n\nThe CDC established guidelines for how states should prioritize vaccine distribution. North Carolina has adopted those guidelines.\n \n1a: Health care workers specifically dealing with COVID (note: this also includes clerical and janitorial staff working in COVID wings) and residents/staff of long-term care facilities.\n \n1b: Adults with at least two chronic conditions that put them at severe risk, and front-line workers at high risk of exposure. \n \n2: Adults over 65, adults under 65 with at least one chronic condition, and front-line workers.\n \n3: College students, K-12 students (when a vaccine is approved for children under 16, which hasn\u2019t happened yet), and essential workers at lower risk of exposure.\n \n4: Everyone else who wants a vaccine.\n\nThe most recent estimate is that we may reach group 1b by mid-January. It depends entirely on whether we continue to receive the vaccine at the rate we expect.\n \n1b is a vastly larger pool of individuals than 1a, so unless we start receiving the vaccine more quickly it will likely take much longer to get through 1b.\n \n\nBOTTOM-LINE\n \nIt\u2019s important to stress that the big variable here - how quickly we get more vaccine - is very difficult to predict.\n \nThat said, at this point it appears the baseline scenario is that it could be many months before we've immunized enough people for it to become a major limiting factor for community spread.\n \nThat means this is still largely up to us, as individuals. We still owe it to each other to keep infection chains as short as possible.\n\n*Our vigilance is the bridge to the vaccine.*\n\nONE MORE THING\n\nIn the meantime, it would be extremely helpful if the U.S. Senate would pass the COVID relief bill they\u2019ve been debating for the last several months so we can get financial help to people while we ask them to stay safe and stay smart. \n\nThe state of North Carolina - like most states - is highly dependent on federal assistance in this circumstance and our state legislature has been waiting since August to get this help. \n\nAssuming they reach a deal soon, I\u2019ll update you on how that relief is being deployed.\n\n- Sen. Jeff Jackson",

            "comment": "You kept mentioning that we all need two doses. What do you think of the idea that giving everyone one immediately may be better than half of the people getting two? \n\nFrom epidemiologists [writing in the NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine-doses.html?referringSource=articleShare):\n\n&gt;While we know that the single dose can protect against disease, we don\u2019t yet know how long this immune protection will last, and at what level.  However, there is no rule that says that vaccines must be boosted within  weeks of each other. For measles, the booster dose is given years after  the first dose. If the booster dose could be given six months or a year  after the first dose, while maintaining high efficacy before the second  dose, that would allow twice as many people to get vaccinated between  now and later next year, accelerating herd immunity \u2014 greatly helping  end the crisis phase of the pandemic in the United States.",

This time last month it was about 10k.\n* About 80% of our ICU beds are currently occupied.\n\n**HERE'S THE SITUATION**\n\nWe've reached a point in this pandemic where people are tired of being told what to think. They're very skeptical about people - especially politicians - making bold claims about what the future holds.\n\nSo here's what I'm going to do: I\u2019m just going to show you the key data points in NC and let you see for yourself where things stand.\n\nThe biggest number that everyone follows is new daily cases. And that chart certainly looks discouraging.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbnwh0w5cg651.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fc0aba6f6c0a363184d96f226752093aa9c012f5\n\nBUT then you follow it with data about new daily testing, and you see that a lot of the increase in new daily cases seems to reflect the increase in testing.\n\nIt\u2019s become a common observation that more testing leads to more (confirmed) cases, and that appears to be true in North Carolina.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6o3b5ou6cg651.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=be799fffec82ff74f2272376c720931e43aeb230\n\nYou might say, \"Well Jeff, both those charts look pretty messy. It's hard to tell if cases really are going up relative to testing.\"\n\nOk, but take a look at this chart that shows the overall percentage of tests that are coming back positive:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kapivo4ecg651.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b811f1d4873bbeef6cdd732bdfa0e93b5155197f\n\nThat should control for the increase in testing, and it\u2019s been flat.\n\nThat\u2019s good news. It means that even though we're testing more, we're not seeing a greater share of those tests come back positive.\n\n**But here\u2019s the problem.** If you look at the hospitalization number, you see a steady increase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wcax916fcg651.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c43c7fa1c73afc95e7425e0cec1bd080308bf85f\n\nAnd that\u2019s not from an increase in testing. That\u2019s more people getting sick.\n\nI should note that there\u2019s a question about this data. Now that people are going back to hospitals for routine procedures, they\u2019re all being tested when they arrive. And some of those folks are testing positive. So now they're *in* the hospital *with* COVID. And it\u2019s unclear to what extent they\u2019re being included in this hospitalization number. In short, we need to make sure we are measuring people who are hospitalized *for* COVID, not *with* COVID. But it's unclear to what extent that explains this increase, if at all.\n\nThen there\u2019s the regional picture. If you zoom out and look at our surrounding states, their daily new cases are all going up - except Virginia, a striking counter-example. It's reasonable to assume there's more testing happening in each of these states, but at a minimum this picture shows us that community spread is ongoing throughout our region.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pobxindgcg651.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9750be016cd46176ba45270763a64d1bcea8a3cd\n\nAnd if we zoom in on the hottest hot spot in North Carolina - Mecklenburg County, where I live - it shows a clear rebounding of hospitalization rates to their highest levels yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eebaourhcg651.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cfa5987ca952ea4394644ede3227737e2b79d912\n\nCompare that to what this chart looked like the day Phase 2 began on May 22 (where I put a red arrow). That's back when we saw a \"sustained leveling\" in hospitalization.\n\nA similar, statewide trend of curve flattening is what made us comfortable enough to leave Phase 1 four weeks ago. That trend of hospitalization flattening appears to have been short-lived, assuming, again, accuracy of the underlying data.\n\nIn summary, when it comes to COVID growth, we wanted negative, we settled for flat, and it appears we got linear.\n\nBut we don't have exponential - at least not yet.\n\n**- Sen. Jeff Jackson**",

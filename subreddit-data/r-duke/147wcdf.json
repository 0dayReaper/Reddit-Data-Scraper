    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI\u2019m a Pratt and Trinity double major and rising junior who just got back from a study abroad. I loved it and am hoping to get one more semester away somewhere new as I doubt once I begin working I\u2019ll really be able to travel to the same extent. \nI\u2019m aware Pratt allows 1 semester abroad but Trinity allows two. Could I take a second semester and only take classes that count towards the Trinity degree requirement? Any other ideas for someone looking to get out of Durham a bit more? \n\n\nThanks!",

There is a reason they only let you do 1 semester. Additionally, if you are in pratt I think it\u2019s not even possible to not take a pratt class every semester.",

    "postText": "I wish I did not feel this way. I am a Junior and Duke has been nothing but traumatic... I am a low income student originally from a low income area and I have always felt so disconnected from Duke. I joined a lot of clubs/activities but most of my friendships feel really surface level and like no one really cares. I never get invited to anything and every day sort of blends together. I do well academically but the classes really suck the life out of me. I always feel one step behind because I will always be the low resource student. Sometimes I eat outside and people watch and everyone looks so happy. Honestly, college has been the most depressing period of my life and I dread returning to campus every time I have to. I am really truly happy when at home or away from Duke. I wonder if anyone feels this way too.",

Keep your head up and things will turn around. If Duke isn't the place for you, there's plenty of opportunities after Duke",

I graduated a while ago, but I was able to find it with people from my relatively small major, and with a group of basketball fans. My wife found it through her church group at her school- even as a non-Christian, I always found the church kids were really nice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd like the show community, you can always form one as a study group for a tough class.",

There are tons of student groups and each has a different focus, so if you know what you like, find a group that does that and the people will likely have similar thoughts. Also, despite the socio-economic differences when you enter Duke, many of those even out as students get internships and work experience. I know plenty of students who entered with barely enough money to go to Shooters and are now, as juniors planning pretty nice vacations for fall break so it definitely is possible to bridge the gap.",

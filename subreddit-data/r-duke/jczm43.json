The original campus (as well as the schoolhouse in the tweet) was a joint venture of Methodists and Quakers. Now I could be wrong, but I find it VERY hard to believe that the Quakers would let slaves build a campus they were a part of. It\u2019s possible that when the Quakers kinda exited Being a part of Brown/Trinity that the Methodists has slaves build additional buildings. But the current campus, I can say quite definitively  that no slave was used. And the Dukes didn\u2019t make their fortune off the backs of slaves. Overall I feel like a lot of people who don\u2019t actually know history got upset and Duke bent the knee.",

He did hire out other folks slaves, which tbh, probably helped those slaves manumission themselves so I\u2019ll put that in the category of being a good guy. Regardless, the Dukes made their fortune after abolition.",

I do wish that he had freed his slave (what I\u2019ve read is slaves) instead of selling them as the war started like he supposedly did. I\u2019m not knocking him, but it\u2019s important that all stories get told.",

He only enlisted after they raised the age for conscription. The Dukes weren\u2019t perfect, but they were far from evil. He hired out slaves. That arrangement often times meant that he would pay both the slave and the owner. It could have not been that way, but that\u2019s probably how it went down. And if that\u2019s the case; good on Washington. Manumission required outside income for slaves",

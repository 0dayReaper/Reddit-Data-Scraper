Since I have AP credits, my schedule would look like this \n\n  \nMATH 212  \nCHEM 201DL  \nWRITING 101 OR EGR 103L  \nEGR 101L\n\nThe problem is that  I am currently in the FOCUS cluster of Science and Humanities of Medieval and Renaissance Europe, which means I would have to push back two of the classes listed above. I am afraid I will have a difficult time catching up on fulfilling the requirements taking two classes that do not really relate to my major ( I am personally very interested in the FOCUS curriculum though). Should I drop out from the FOCUS cluster or remain in it?\n\nAny help is appreciated! Thank you.",

There are very few freshman classes that have multi as a pre-req, since most people take it sophomore year to my knowledge. I don't know enough about Chem 201 to know whether or not to push it back, but I imagine that's also fine. You probably do wanna do EGR101 first semester tho, and writing 101 is something you can't move (depends on which group you are in)",

The then lift the block off of your registration abilities so you can register on the given day. You can meet with someone before bookbagging opens up, but it is unlikely it will be your advisor and you will have to meet w your advisor again anyway in order to be able to register. Bookbaghing begins June 28th so that is around the time you should hear from your advisor. Incoming freshmen are assigned advisors. You usually meet w them during O-week in person as well! Hope that helps!",

Professors and TAs and other students are very helpful, and it never feels like a competition, but there is a shit ton of material and it\u2019s hard. Also means that you might have less time for fun stuff than a non-engineering major.\n\n- lots of opportunities while you\u2019re studying. Lots of undergrads do research, some do engineering clubs/organizations as well. Never feels like you\u2019re fighting for your life to get spots.\n\n- people are welcoming and friendly and helpful. This pretty much applies to everyone at Duke, but it 1000% saves you multiple times over your time in BME. Cannot be stressed enough.\n\n- on top of this you still have enough time to have friends and hang out and dedicate significant time to fun stuff.",

It is indeed true that you can only use 2 ap credits under your current trajectory. However, there are quite a few cases where your AP credits could become relevant. For one, many college students switch majors. I don't have an exact number, but googling gives data anywhere from 30 to 80 percent. There's a quite high chance you'll reevaluate and decide on a different major, and keeping the option to switch to BME is quite nice (since its an adjacent field to bio/premed in general). FYI, pratt has no limit on AP credits you can use to place into higher level classes, if there's a course equivalent in your curricular path. \n\nAdditionally, if you decide you want to graduate 1 or 2 semesters early, I believe you are allowed to use more AP credits. \n\nThere's honestly probably even more situations, but those are two that can come up, and I think its worth keeping the flexibility open.",

You can count up to two AP credits towards the 34-credit graduation requirement to lower that to 32 credits (but they won't apply to any other graduation requirements, so it does not matter whatsoever what AP exams these are\u2014all that matters is that you have at least 2 AP credits done already). If you don't already have 2, then I'd just do 2 to be able to get that credit. \n\nIf you do have 2 exams to get those 2 general credits, then...\n\n1. AP Physics 1 is useless.\n\n2. AP Lit is also useless.\n\n3. AP Macro and micro are useful and let you skip into Econ 201 instead of starting in 101. If you think you'll take Econ 201, then do these two. \n\n4. AP Gov is useless.\n\nYou should absolutely take AP exams that will help you skip into higher level courses; it's virtually always worth it. But none of these APs except for the Econ ones would let you skip any courses, so they're not really worth taking unless you don't already have the 2 AP credits.",

They really want you to stay around for four years and there are limits to how many classes you can take in a semester.\n\nBe upfront with your advisor as soon as possible and let them know this is what you want. While they can help point you in the right direction, advisors are full-time faculty and may not be versed with graduating early. It will take a lot of planning on your part and organization to get the right classes you need in the right order. And you won't have too much time for fun classes. Note that Duke also has other requirements like a ALPs you'll have to take which may be harder to encounter in your CS + Math IDM without careful planning. Duke is a lot of fun and I wouldn't rush it to graduate, ESPECIALLY with full financial aid! You're throwing away a year of free college!\n\nNow for the 1 year master's....I was under the impression that the 4+1 is only for Pratt students, and as stated, requires 4 years in Pratt: [https://pratt.duke.edu/undergrad/degrees/bse-masters](https://pratt.duke.edu/undergrad/degrees/bse-masters). Not sure if the graduate school CS MS allows 1 year. By the way, your financial aid wouldn't apply for the MS, if that was why you mentioned it upfront.",

Long answer: You can apply for, and get into a graduate program in Aerospace Engineering without the certificate or extracurriculars at all, since Mechanical engineering and aerospace engineering are so similar, but doing those activities and the certificate help. The certificate itself won't matter much, but in taking it you'll take a bunch of aerospace classes and those will matter. \n\nDepending on what you want to do in Aerospace, it might not even be necessary to get a degree in it, lots of aircraft and spacecraft stuff is done by mechanical engineers, and experience doing what you want to work/research will matter way more than which major or certificate you complete.\n\nDm me if you want to talk about it more, or about AERO, Duke's high powered rocketry club",

The semester before that had ~130 students in the class. \n\nI'm kind of a fan personally of duke's setup for intro classes tbh. One or two big lectures standardizes everyone's foundation imo, and you get fewer situations where you and your peers have very different knowledge bases. And CS classes have discussions of like ~10 people, so you are getting the small class exposure as well. A bit of both worlds.\n\nI do think on average other majors are slightly smaller in class size, since CS is such a fast growing major. But intro courses can still be pretty big (i think the biology one is rather large). And yes, as a general rule, class size gets smaller as the difficulty of the class gets harder.",

East Campus is a lot closer to the rest of Durham, but it's also a smaller area and there will still be security officers around.\n\nThere are also times when buses don't run, and that's when you'll call a Duke Van and they'll send a car to wherever you are and pick you up.

Are the classes very fast paced and hard, or is the system also geared towards students who didnt do competitive level math and is collaborative and helpful?\n\nAlso how selective are opportunities like DoMath.\n\nThank you for responding.",

                    "comment": "The gateway math courses (221 and 222) are not super hard. The nice thing is that they\u2019re not curved, so the whole class can get As, unlike 212 (normal multi). And they\u2019re a lot smaller than the equivalents (212 and 218), which lets you get to know other math majors. They have pretty active group chats and people are always working together on homework (in higher level courses some profs give extra credit for working in groups on the homework). They move moderately fast, but that\u2019s really just how college math courses work. \n\nNo competition experience needed nor expected\u2014although even people with no experience are welcome to sit in and participate in the Putnam preparation seminar (281S) in the fall. \n\nNot sure about DOmath\u2019s selectivity, but I don\u2019t think you don\u2019t need to be super accomplished to get in\u2014genuine interest (eg good essays explaining why you want to do it) seems to be the most important thing. If you\u2019re considering math grad school (and you take courses that indicate that, eg 221 and 222), you\u2019ll probably get in at least once.",

I'll add a little bit to it here (and if anyone viewing this is curious what I wrote previously, it is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/mlg2ac/transferring_from_trinity_to_pratt/)).\n\nI personally loved math classes at Duke, even though I ended up one class short of a math major. Classes can definitely be challenging, but most professors are quite passionate and teach well (esp at higher levels). I found the student body quite collaborative as well. Also, Duke is a research institution, so there's very little emphasis placed on math competitions (our putnam team is honestly tiny). No assumption of any competitive math at all (and arguably, high level competition math and high level academic math have very little overlap)",

Walk around west campus, go from west to east campus, and if you're not exhausted, walk from east to downtown Durham. Also, I'd recommend eating off campus to both find some cool restaurants and bc you'll be eating more than enough Duke food once you're there for classes. Other than that don't really have too much advice. You pretty quickly get a feel for things once you move in, including the humidity which was one of the things that took most people by surprise.",

I decided on CS very late, but /u/xlany would you happen to be able summarize what opportunities existed when you looked? \n\nI have no clue on the getting in note. Transferring in general is very difficult as I'm sure you know, but no clue on specifically CS. I do know for undergrad, the major isn't really taken into account.\n\nAs mentioned, I didn't start in CS (was into aerospace). But I do think Duke has a lotta good CS profs and good job prospects. There's obv also the general connections/prestige of Duke itself. For me, some of the bigger reasons in no particular order was its beautiful campus (we often joke the tuition money is just to maintain the grass), the academic caliber, the food (WU was just constructed and Duke had quite the foodie reputation), and the hot girls.\n\nNo idea if this is too late, but hope it helps if you do/did end up deciding to transfer.",

Some example are:\n\nFreshman year I did Bass Connections which is a research program with both undergraduate and graduate students. Our topic was machine learning analysis on satellite images. Super cool area to get involved as a freshman!\n\nThe summer after sophomore year I did Data+ but there is now a CS+ (linked [here](https://www.cs.duke.edu/undergrad/summer_research)) which is CS research with faculty and similar to your interests.\n\nJunior and senior year a lot of people join CS research labs now that they have more experience. A ton of my friends did this (landmine detection, quantum computing, ML, all types of stuff) although ultimately I did not go down this track. So many opportunities, and you can get involved by directly emailing professors. \n\nOverall Duke is a great choice for college. Can vouch for the amazing liberal arts education and hot girls;)",

Also, if anyone has some tips about Duke specific interviews that would be amazing. I have had two other interviews and have a decent idea of what to talk about but anything Duke specific would be great. General advice would help too!",

I\u2019m not sure that having an interview is anything bad and I know a lot of people who had them who also got in. The Duke interview was very relaxed (at least for me) and a tip I have is just to make yourself memorable. I ended talking about track and field and the events I do, and my alumni interviewer hadn\u2019t heard of any of the events before and was very intrigued. You want to stand out and be yourself. They have everything in your application already in front of them (your grades, your essays, etc) but they want to know who you are and how you can contribute to Duke University and what you can take away from the Duke experience as well. I hope that helped !",

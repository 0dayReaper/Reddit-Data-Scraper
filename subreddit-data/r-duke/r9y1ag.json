They\u2019ve been trying for a while to get more job security and are advocating to get the no renewable contracts to be renewable. All nonrenewable staff are being let go. \n\nThe current writing program is ranked 2 in the nation, but Duke wants to change the program from writing about topics you care about to a general composition and rhetoric class. Professors were notified about this change three days ago. Duke put out job listings already to hire people with PHD\u2019s in literature and writing and are offering higher pay and more job security than current professors. The current professors had been asking for higher pay (they\u2019re paid less than normal faculty) and Duke put them off saying they can\u2019t afford to- which clearly isn\u2019t the case. \n\nThe current professors have been here for so long and they know about all the resources that Duke offers to their students. They can easily refer students to all these resources that new profs may not know well. The current writing program is great and also highly ranked, there is no reason to change it to a composition class. That\u2019s what high school is for.",

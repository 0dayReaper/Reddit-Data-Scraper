FOMO is real.\n\nA lot of me becoming happier at Duke is just remembering the saying that \"you compare everyone else's highlight reel (social media) to your own bloopers.\" As corny as it is, it reminds me, that the people whose semester recaps look like they're living it up probably had just as much stress over lab reports, networking, social or romantic relationships, family issues, or any other stuff behind the scenes that we don't see.",

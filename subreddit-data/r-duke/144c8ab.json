I'll highly appreciate it if someone who previously taken the course could provide a copy of the syllabus.\n\nThanks!",

Please note that the course was conducted online during that semester, and there may have been variations in terms of homework, quizzes, attendance, etc. However, I guess the core curriculum is expected to remain unchanged this Fall. Maybe we could contact her to obtain the most up-to-date version.",

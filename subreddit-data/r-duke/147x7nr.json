    "postText": "I'm a rising sophomore planning to major in PubPol. I'm interested in someday going into politics. A female friend had a seriously strange interaction with a Democracy Lab prof who suggested if women just \"put out\" more and satisfied the men more diligently, democracy would be stronger. So...is that a thing in PubPol? Apparently, it was reported but the prof is still there and teaching. He's also invited female undergrads to drinks after class etc. Anyone else heard of this?",

Not to discredit your friend\u2014just saying that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s common or else I would hear it through the grapevine. Avoid that one dude. \n\nI hope this doesn\u2019t deter you from pubpol and that you never have weird experiences. and if you do, I hope that you\u2019re able to come forward and that the proper steps are taken to make sure it never happens again",

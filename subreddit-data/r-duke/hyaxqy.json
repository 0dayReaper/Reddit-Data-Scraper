My grades and my work ethic definitely suffered last semester because I was so distracted by my family (and it's just in general hard for me to focus at home). Plus, my mental health and my relationship with my family has deteriorated a lot since coming home, so moving out would give me the space I need.",

My question is - why do you feel that lab experience you want must be acquired at Duke?\n\nLab experience can be acquired anywhere. If you are stuck at home, email professors closer to your hometown and volunteer to work in their labs. This will allow you to acquire your desire for lab experience while also satisfy your parents desire to keep you at home.",

I think I\u2019m considering not going back at all, as there\u2019s really no point in living in Durham vs at home if I\u2019m not allowed to use campus facilities.\n\nStill not sure what to feel.

    "postText": "I am from UCLA and today, Matthew Harris, a former lecturer and postgrad in philosophy who also spent some time at Duke, sent a series of disturbing videos as well as a 800 page manifesto expressing his intentions to commit a mass shooting. His youtube channel was deleted less than five minutes ago but I managed to take some screenshots and one of them is what I am showing here. This video seems to be the only one referencing Duke based on its title alone. I am taking the incentive to let y'all know because my own university is doing a terrible job at doing so. To make things worse, no one knows where Dr. Harris is, though it is known that he resides on the east coast.\n\nTake care.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zwk35xsxd6f81.jpg?width=2524&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=10c253e1baec68604ca1ebcad4099ea76b752804",

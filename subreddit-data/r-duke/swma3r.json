    "postText": "Title.\n\nI didn't have exactly the most flourishing high school experience. I wasn't miffed at it\u2014the people at my high school are very different from me, and once I got to college I would find my people.\n\nSince I've come to Duke all my various friend groups have shed me out of their circles. The only \"friends\" I have left ignore most of my texts. They never say it but I know what I mean to them: an annoyance, a disturbance to be ignored and silenced.\n\nI feel like a ghost teetering on the edge of existence and unexistence. I deeply crave human connection yet every time I have reached out for it I have been cut off. It's humiliating. I don't even know if, or why, I deserve it. I think I'm a good person who treats others well. I always am there for someone else, to comfort someone when they're hurting. Now I'm siloed away from the world on my 21st birthday in my dorm room. I feel drained and left out to dry. I never have a friend to walk or eat or study with. In all my years on campus I have been alone. I live alone in a double sized room. \n\nI have so much love to give yet nobody wants it.\n\nSometimes, including right now, I seriously question the merits of continued existence. I'm already in this weird limbo where, save for my family and class, I just end up alone in my dorm on my phone, a person behind a door that is merely and forever passed by instead of opened.\n\nNow it's my 21st birthday, a big day to be spent with friends and people around you who support you and love you. And I have nobody. I get the perfunctory well wishes from acquaintances\u2014but more dominant is the sense that nobody truly cares and everyone is too busy to worry about me.\n\nI'm not even sure if it's a good idea to post this. I just want someone to hold my hand, tell me it's okay, and invite me to go do something for my birthday. I feel worthless. My stoicism has emptied me of a will to keep existing. I'm just. tired. It's like I don't exist. I don't want to exist.\n\nI don't want any empty gestures either, like pats on the back for being brave enough to scream and reveal my pain, or well-meaning referrals to therapy, or trite expressions about how it'll get better. I want friendship, god damnit\u2014unconditional friendship, companionship, to be told \"I'm glad you're here\", which I don't think I've ever had a peer tell me at Duke.",

I\u2019m not going to offer any platitudes but if you want to talk to someone who at least has a bit of experience with what you\u2019re going through, feel free to dm me.",

            "comment": "I think a huge issue about Duke is that socialization has the ability to further success, and so a lot of people approach it differently than expected. Unfortunately, this ability reinforces the idea that the primary use of  friendships isn\u2019t social support or emotional fulfillment. I made lots of surface level friendships as an extrovert, but really only found a genuine friend group my senior year at Duke. Some of these people were from the surface level friends I had come to know earlier but only got closer because I began to participate even more in activities that meant a lot to me and to them; these friendships occurred slowly and, I think, only after time had proven there was no intention to use each other for anything (or if the other parties were indeed genuine). \n\nI will say that the competitiveness and difficulty of Duke is a lot more intense for some people than others, and that would be cause for a lot of the students to reach out less; for example, I\u2019m an extrovert but really struggled with balancing my hobbies and classes, and barely reached out to anyone. Again, that meant I could only find genuine friendships through joining things that furthered my hobbies; otherwise, socializing was a chore. So some of my loneliness was self inflicted as well.  If any of that resonates with you I\u2019d like to know what you think. And at the very least, I wish you happy birthday!! (Dw, I didn\u2019t do anything for my 21st either :))",

Still, it does get better. If I was on campus I'd invite you out for a beer, but I'm damn near 40 and several hours away so unfortunately can't help you there.\n\nI know you don't want well-meaning referrals for therapy, BUT, there's a whole team of people on campus whose sole purpose is to help people get in a better head space.

Duke has been a lonely place for me too, after also not having a lot of friendships in high school (full of fairly entitled people I didn\u2019t really relate to) and similarly hoping I would find my \u201cpeople\u201d in college. Bottom line is that I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re feeling this way - it sucks to feel like you have so much to give and that nobody wants it - and if you\u2019re open to it, I\u2019d love to try and be that person if you ever want to meet up or hang out. Feel free to DM me, and please know that you\u2019re not alone in feeling this way.",

            "comment": "Hey op happy belated! I relate to not having a history of happy friendships in high school and also had a solitary 21st birthday. When walking around campus, it looks like basically everyone has their people. It\u2019s hard when college is supposedly the best time for making life-long friendships, so maybe not meeting people now means an even tougher time making friends after graduation. Relationships seem like the most important thing for a meaningful and healthy life. Not having them ... insert *chuckles I\u2019m in danger* meme\n\nWhat helps me is realizing that we can survive and even thrive individually now. The evolutionary reasons for needing to be part of a tribe for survival don\u2019t really apply to our lives today. Being there for people is a nice thing to do, though I try to remember that aiming to be helpful for someone else also serves to make yourself feel better (tbh what I\u2019m doing by responding to you). I noticed how much easier it was to be with people here when I\u2019m just vibing, okay with their acceptance/approval and without. And even when I\u2019m feeling lonely, there\u2019s still plenty of moments when life is worth living simply while being immersed in a funny movie or god forbid an interesting hw assignment. It\u2019s also cool to think about certain artists, writers, and other people who thrived because they had lots of solitude. If that lifestyle isn\u2019t your cup of tea though I hope the kindred spirits in this thread can keep you company in the meantime :)",

If they are not treating you with respect, don't waste even one more second of your time trying to please them. It is extraordinarily unhealthy to keep putting effort into relationships with the same people if they have made it clear that they don't care enough about you to reciprocate. Stop talking to them and put that effort into finding people who actually care! When I did this with my old \"friends,\" it certainly felt risky at first, but within a few days I realized that severing ties was absolutely liberating. It opened my eyes to the world beyond them, and I was very soon able to find people who truly care about me for who I am. If you just let it happen naturally, you could meet some of your best friends before you know it. The most important thing is to just leave your old \"friends\" behind as soon as possible and look forward towards the future. The rest will come to you with enough time. I believe in you!",

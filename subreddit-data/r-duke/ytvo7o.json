I was wondering if I could have an IDM with two certificates, specifically Information Science &amp; Studies and Markets &amp; Management Studies. Is it possible to have an IDM with those certificates or do they have to be majors and minors?",

For example, you could make one between the Classical Studies *department* and the Linguistics *program*, and then you'd go about selecting 7 relevant classes from each department (another reason this isn't possible, as ISS only has 6 classes). Certificates could serve as inspiration for an IDM as they themselves are quite interdisciplinary. \n\nYou could very well take both certificates. It is perfectly feasible to do a major as well as two certificates, given you make smart choices about Trinity course requirements. You could also create an IDM with the themes in those certificates, choosing relevant courses out of some mix of Socio, Econ, CompSci, CulAnth, PoliSci, etc, that fit your goals of what you want to get out of this mixture. I would personally opt for the former, as certificates are specially designed for the purpose they serve.\n\n[https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/majors-minors-certificates-interdepartmental-major](https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/majors-minors-certificates-interdepartmental-major)",

I highly doubt you'll ever get a definitive response, as the admissions file doesn't list the criteria (in fact, it's quite boring, just numbers and checkboxes mostly).",

Visiting this upcoming week.)\r  \n\r  \nI wanted to know how easy/difficult it is for Duke undergrad students to get paid research positions? From what I understand if you qualify for work-study funding is provided through that, but what if we wanted to work beyond our work-study amount? And what if we receive outside scholarships that replace the work-study, is it still possible to receive funding/compensation for working in a research lab? (I figure payment might be prioritized toward work-study students, so not sure how exactly it works at Duke.) Are there any fellowships/paid internship opportunities related to research offered through Duke? And do let me know your personal experiences with research at Duke! Thanks!\r  \n\r  \nAlso, a bit of an unrelated question, but is it common for undergrad students to work as a TA? I just wanted to have a better idea of the on-campus job opportunities available haha.",

UCSD, UMich, etc.) So, for any students currently in that major (undergrad):  \n1. Overall thoughts? How developed is the program?   \n2. What are the job prospects?   \n3. Are the teachers any good?   \n4. Is the program more like half art, half cs, or is it one where it seems to be more combined, as in you can use your cs skills in art classes and vice versa?   \nThank you!",

The old policy:\n\n&gt;Currently, masks are still required in outdoor campus settings where social distancing measures cannot be maintained\n\nSo you always didn't have to mask when you could distance outdoors, but have to when you can't, and that is the same now.\n\nThe substantial difference is on indoor environments, as far as I can tell.",

            "comment": "I've now read the article from this latest incident, and another article about an email the same person wrote a year ago.\n\nIn both emails, she\n\n* ascribed the complaint to someone other than herself\n* mentioned that it could make it harder to obtain employment or other positive considerations from people in the department\n* pointed out that the students were \"passing up an opportunity\" to practice their English\n* referred to the \"loud\" nature of the non-English speaking incident(s)\n\nWhat are the chances that all these things are common to incidents in both years?\n\nThis makes me wonder if it isn't her own agenda. There isn't enough evidence here to consider it proof, but I'll give odds that there weren't any other professors stopping by her office to look at pictures and take names. I think she made them up, and I think she made up the \"many\" people who complained about it a year ago. (If she DIDN'T make it up, someone should point out to these recent professors what a tricky business it is to identify people from photographs, particularly people from another race.)\n\nI hope the investigation that was called for will follow up on the facts stated in the email; if she was making things up in order to spread an agenda she seems to have advocated before, that makes her actions even worse.\n\nI personally agree that, IN A GROUP SETTING, it is impolite to conduct a conversation, on the side or otherwise, in a language other than one common to the group setting. I just don't agree that Hock Plaza, in the large, is always such a place. Two people there, speaking Chinese to each other with no reasonable expectation that anyone else is to be part of their conversation? I don't think that's a problem. I might wish I could eavesdrop, but that's my problem.\n\nOf course, if I were a racist so-and-so, I might get irritated enough to broadcast an email with a made-up reason to get people to quit. I find it highly ironic that she stated in the 2018 email that she \"didn't want to be the language police\". I think that's exactly what she was doing; whether she actually wanted to or not I have no further information.",

Also the DGS was suggesting students speak their second language while in the building in order to help them practice their english which is a professional skill for them. Since the ratio of international students to citizens in this program is about 25:5 in favor of international students its entirely possible that there was a problem with Chinese students simply speaking Chinese the vast majority of the time and thus failing to properly develop there english.

But she seems to genuinely be sorry and to care for her international students. So perhaps this is not the satan, white supremacist twitter makes her out to be. ",

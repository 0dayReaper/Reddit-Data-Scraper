I just saw that I can\u2019t get a physical Duke card unless my phone isn\u2019t compatible with some app. At the university I\u2019m finishing up at physical student ids are needed for dining, building access, etc. How does it work at Duke if it\u2019s all digital now? And is the system reliable?",

There's readers in the doors of your dorm building, readers for you to pay for food, and just readers everywhere. You don't have to scan your face to your phone or anything before tapping. You literally just put your phone near the reader without even clicking anything on your phone and it'll tap and open.",

Unless they're doing things differently for undergrads I think they've phased out the physical cards entirely save for special circumstances. I made an appointment at the office last month to pick up a physical card, only to be told that they could not issue me one unless I worked with the medical center. Haven't been back to campus yet to see how well the digital card actually works.",

In this use case you would need to partner with your program directly on getting your DukeCard issued\u201d. It sounded like physical Duke cards are the exception and not the norm",

            "comment": "That sounds like something you want to be absolutely sure about before doing, so I would ask your major advisor (or, if you're a rising freshman/sophomore, someone like the Assistant to the Director of Undergraduate Studies). \n\nI graduated in the middle of COVID, so I don't know what the policy is now, but here are my assumptions:\n\n* I wouldn't think taking a second course S/U would be a problem.\n\n* I would be surprised if you were allowed to take your major requirements S/U. I didn't see anything about it on the Econ BS page, but there's probably a University-wide policy somewhere.\n\nBut again, double check with someone who can give you an official answer",

Course description(s) should tell you whether a course does not allow S/U grading; not all of them do.\n\nIn general, I always recommend starting without S/U; you have until the withdrawal deadline to request it.",

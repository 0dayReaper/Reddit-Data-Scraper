    "postText": "Hey, Duke students! There are plenty of great local restaurants near campus and around town you should know about and frequent (while wearing a mask and social distancing, of course):\n\n\nNinth Street Area:\n\n- Banh\u2019s - great Vietnamese restaurant, locally owned by the sweetest people. They have a more traditional menu on Wednesday and Saturday. \n\n- Dain\u2019s Place - known for their burgers and tots, but they\u2019re other menu options are good too. They even carry the Impossible burger. Plenty of local and craft beer options if you\u2019re of age.\n\n- The Regulator - wonderful, local bookstore. Don\u2019t order books on amazon, support local business! If they don\u2019t have what you\u2019re looking for, they\u2019ll order it for you.\n\n- Durham Pack &amp; Ship - will take care of all your mailing and shipping needs. Stop in and say hello to the dogs who are often their with the owner.\n\n- Mi Cavillo - newer to Ninth St, but they have great tacos, empanadas, etc. \n\n- Vaguely Reminiscent - fun &amp; unique, but tiny place to shop for birthday gifts for friends and family. \n\n- Alpaca - delicious Peruvian chicken! Be sure you get the rice and beans as one of your sides.\n\n- Happy &amp; Hale - good salads, smoothies, and bowls. You can create your own bowl, too.\n\n- Cosmic Cantina - craving a burrito or quesadilla at 1am? Cosmic is your go to place. Open late and they have amazing burritos. \n\n- MadHatter\u2019s - near Whole Foods and offer amazing cookies, cakes, cupcakes, and sandwiches.\n\n- Cloche - wonderful coffee and tea! \n\n- Heavenly Buffalos - best wings in town and they\u2019ll deliver to you!  \n\n- Hunky Dory - cool record shop \n\n\n\nCentral Park / Geer Street Area\n\n- FullSteam Brewery - local brewery that now serves food. \n\n- MotorCo - food, drinks, and great music venue. Try the tuna slider - it\u2019s amazing! MotorCo and FullSteam have been in their locations before Durham was cool.\n\n- Hutchins Garage - best pizza in town! Try the beet salad while you\u2019re there. When the menu says spicy, it\u2019s going to be spicy!\n\n- Geer St Garden - local restaurant with creative weekly specials. Owner has supported his staff and the community by organizing meal give aways during Covid. \n\n- Cocoa Cinnamon - they have three locations in town and all are great. \n\n- Durham Farmers Market - in Central Park every Saturday morning.

Go out the back door for a lovely and often unnoticed outdoor space.\n\n- Durty Bull Brewery - local brewery with creative craft beers.\n\n- Surf Club, The Bar, PickleBack - all locally owned places to go for fun night out. They may not have reopened yet, but stop by when they do.\n\n\n\nBrightleaf Square\n\n- The Federal - this bar punches above its weight with food. Best nachos in town!\n\n- James Joyce - another good option for food and drinks.

Party supplies, decorations, etc.\n\n- Morgan Imports - wonderful store just to wander through because of all the fun stuff they have. Be sure you go in November and December when they have all their holiday stuff.\n\n- Parker &amp; Otis - fun store, restaurant, and coffee shop. Another good place to shop for gifts.

            "comment": "Q Shack- really good bbq and sides \n\nNuvo Taco- tacos, burritos (right next door to Q shaq)\n\nBeer study- great place to enjoy beer, can bring your own food (across the street from Nuvo taco). They are building a soccer pub next door and should be opening shortly. \n\nSaltbox- great seafood; veteran and minority owned\n\nEastcut- great sandwiches \n\nMonuts- really good breakfast and lunch items. Food is locally sourced, they pay employees a livable wage, LGBTQ friendly. \n\nElmo\u2019s- classic diner with good affordable food \n\nBackyard BBQ- real good bbq. Get the Mac and cheese. It might not look like much from the outside but man the food is good. \n\nChicken Hut\u2014-I\u2019ve actually never been but they have a great social media presence and they have been in Durham for over 50 years. Locally and black owned. Soul food, and they\u2019ve done a lot for the community during Covid. \n\nPonysaurus\u2014 brewery with food trucks almost every day. All outdoor seating right now and they are taking COVID seriously. I felt very comfortable when I was there. \n\n\n\nI believe all these places are owned by good people and they support the community. They have done a lot to try and survive and provide comfort and joy to the community during this crazy time",

A growing favorite in the community, and the Durham food place I miss the most.\n\nPincho Loco - a small, family-run ice cream shop near Cosmic. People are always friendly and the ice cream is delicious.\n\nBrightleaf:\n\nEl Rodeo - a casual Mexican restaurant that serves good food at a very affordable price\n\nLakewood:\n\nScrap Exchange - OP brought this up as a great place to walk around, but I have to mention that there are all sorts of things worth buying here too :). Picked up many board games/books/clothes for dance performances/random accessories from the Scrap Exchange over junior and senior year.",

It works when I'm craving Mexican, or something more adventurous. Everything from quesadillas to fresh fish is a winner. \n\n* Affordable enough that it was a doable splurge place for me as a poor undergrad (also a great date spot) \n\n* The same owners have operated since it opened in the 90s and they've always hired Duke students, and treated them extremely well. Many have worked there their entire Duke careers. \n\n* Their dining room is spacious, and while I haven't been in since they re-opened, the tables were already spaced out pre-COVID since the expansion a few years ago. \n\nGive them a try if you haven't, it's a special place!\n\nedit: typos",

Both are delicious, have indoor and outdoor seating, delicious food, wonderful service, and good cocktails! \nAfter dusk, grabbing a cocktail and sitting on Main Street feels like a dream that we\u2019re in Europe. It\u2019s a much needed escape. \nRun by a husband and wife who live on a farm used to produce materials for the restaurant. All of the staff, a mere 12 people, work both in the restaurant downtown and the farm as well. It\u2019s a VERY cool place and I can not recommend it enough.",

    "postText": "After spending two hours trying to create a good schedule, I have come to the conclusion that my focus classes are entirely preventing me from taking classes that are essential to my desired majors (Econ and compscj). For fuller context, the focus cluster I got into was my second choice. I am interested in the material, but the last thing I want is to get behind because of focus. Should I drop my focus classes?\n\nEdit: thank you all for the advice. I have decided to drop focus. My major requirements and personal interests take priority. I will not fall to the sunk cost fallacy.",

            "comment": "Yikes, I really encourage you to rethink dropping focus. I know tons of people who really enjoyed theirs, and you shouldn\u2019t be limiting yourself to nothing but major requirements, especially as a freshman who hasn\u2019t even declared yet - what if you end up changing your majors later? Also, college is about exploring and trying new things, and you\u2019ll regret it if you don\u2019t take advantage of the opportunities you get at a place like Duke. Why go to a liberal arts college if you\u2019re not going to expand your education by studying a variety of subjects? If you\u2019re worried about job prospects, keep in mind that the education you get at Duke is basically equivalent to a masters degree at most state schools, and employers will care a lot more about the name on your diploma than the specific classes you took, especially since you will be trained on the job later.",

I did pre-med, bio major, BAA minor, philosophy minor, studied abroad a semester, and had elective or two to spare. So dont worry about finishing your desired majors. You can always do summer class work if needed. Focus was great for making good friends with the other kids in the program and having interested/engaged senior faculty as a freshman. Not sure how focus has changed in last 30yrs tho",

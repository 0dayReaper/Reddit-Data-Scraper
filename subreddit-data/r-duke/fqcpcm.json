    "postText": "Duke is way cooler. Professor Flanagan bought dinner for our philosophy class every other week (like actually drove us to sit down restaurants.) OLA gives his CS201 class T-shirts. There's a healthy mix of geeks and bros and all sorts of people. You can play pick up in the gym and strangers will cheer you on for making a shot. You can work on any type of project you want, it's a lot easier to get engaged than in other schools. We have cute kitties named Peaches and Mamabean in Keohane. We have a celebrity golden retriever named Nugget. You can get hyped about sports with total strangers at Krafthouse.\n\n\n\nI don't care what the other school is. Duke is cooler. If you're an engineer, pay no attention to our lower rankings. Undergrads here built the world's most fuel efficient land vehicle a couple of years ago. \n\nJust the small rambling of the things I enjoyed during my 3.75? years there. Fuck this quarantineeeeee\n\nEdit: Some mod stickied this post (i'm a mod now too i guess but that's just to remove spammers) but i made this just to lighten spirits and recognize the small things that i enjoyed at duke. There are many other reasons to pick/not pick duke, so don't take this post too seriously",

I have some things that looking back now are/were really wonderful and heartwarming: \n\nOne of my Romance Studies professor took us out to class \u201coutside\u201d in which we met at restaurants and had class there. He would pick the restaurant, that way students could explore Durham (which, unfortunately, many didn\u2019t already do in their free time!) \n\nAnother professor brought homemade baked goods for us every other week. \n\nMy W101 prof saw me a month ago, 3 years later (and I\u2019ve changed quite a bit physically since) and still recognized me and asked about my life. \nAt Marketplace, Julia always remembered the regulars but also those from years past (to this day, she still knows my name and gives me a hug when I visit). \n\nDon\u2019t even get me started on WU workers &lt;3, who remember my order and ask me about my girlfriend when they don\u2019t see us together. \nThe fact that we have a Facebook group to take care of the animals on campus, making sure they\u2019re always feed and loved. \nNugget has literally gotten me out depressive episodes lol \n\nAnd even through their *infamous* reputation, bros from Wayne and Cooper have offered me a beer at their quad darties\u2014and on LDOC, everyone is just like \u201cyou want alcohol? Here, drink up!\u201d and half of my professors expected (and some encouraged) seniors to come drunk to class, for the heck of it. \n\nIt\u2019s sad I\u2019ll miss these things, that it was a \u201clast time\u201d for quite a bit of them. However, I look back and Duke has been pretty great... and it\u2019s all about the people I\u2019ve met there.",

            "comment": "Advisors are allowed to specify types of students they are interested in working with (1G, athletes, etc.) as well as to specify their own academic background, the theory being that an advisor who has work experience in IT and a CS degree might be interested in working someone who wants to major in CS, that kind of thing. In the past they had also tried to have you advise students in a specific dorm, though I don't know if that's still a thing.\n\nIt may also feel random because a lot of advisors are staff and not faculty. Because Duke really wants you to have a 1-1 relationship with someone, and there aren't enough faculty who have time and capacity to do that, they allow staff to advise as well. It might feel like a bit of a letdown to have a staff member, but some staff have been advising for years, and they actually have the time to learn the nuances of things like registration and career services and all the university offices that faculty usually don't. So you can get more direct advice that way.",

            "comment": "Smallness27 has it right. Academic advising for your first few semesters at Duke (at least in Trinity) is meant to be more about providing someone to be a sounding board and guide to the various departments and resources at Duke. They aren\u2019t supposed to have the answers for you so much as help you find them. Now, some advisors do, or will do whatever they can to find them, but ultimately Duke really wants you to find them out for yourself (in the spirit of the liberal arts education at its finest) and the advisors to be there to make sure you do it right and are ok. Ultimately the really specific/hard questions you have are meant to go up to your academic dean or the AAC.\nI was given the opportunity to select the prospective majors of first years I\u2019d like to work with, but I think it is mostly still random.",

I\u2019ve taken the LSAT and the LSAT practices, and am having trouble getting higher scores, it could be a number of things... i need someone who could share some tips, and/or just help me out a little with what you may see that I\u2019m doing wrong.  I wouldn\u2019t mind compensating, however the LSAT tutors in the area are so expensive. So just a shot in the dark, I guess.",

Then after you grade, you need to log your makes and misses, and try and look for patterns of weakness - which section is your weakest, are you consistently missing a certain question type, are you running out of time, etc. Once you've done that and feel like you can't get any further, then that's time to start thinking about a private tutor (or not going to law school, b/c it's a huge $$$/time commitment).",

    "postText": "Hello guys. I started in 2019 with a bunch of acquaintances that I eventually drifted away from \u2014 they went back to Ottawa during/after Covid and I stayed online. Almost all of them have stated that they\u2019re graduating this spring and going to the ceremony so I was excited to see them! But there\u2019s a list of graduates and I have searched their names and none of them come up. I was just thinking maybe the deadline to agree to go to the ceremony is this Friday so they haven\u2019t had a chance to confirm or maybe this list is merely just students who have agreed to go to the ceremony early? [Or maybe my acquaintances all agreed to not go to the ceremony and lied to me about it lol :( ]any info helps! [This is the website I used!](https://convocation.carleton.ca/ceremony/graduate-listing/)",

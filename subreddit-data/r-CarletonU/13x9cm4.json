    "postText": "I applied 2 months ago to graduate in June but my but my application is still not approved. It's now the first of June and I'm getting stressed now. I have not received any emails, I don't know when graduation is, nor how to get my gown. I meet all the requirements to graduate and have good marks, not sure what's holding up my application.  \n\nThis is unusual right? I dont want to get approved and get an email saying hey u graduate in 5 days. I need some time to get arranged and for my parents to take work off and stuff. **Has anyone been approved yet? Anyone else in the same boat as me? Please let me know!**",

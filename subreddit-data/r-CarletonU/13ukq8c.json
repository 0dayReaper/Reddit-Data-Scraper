Would either of these be okay? What other suggestions do you guys have for laptops? Any software compatibility issues with the Macbook?",

            "comment": " Both laptops are pretty good besides the typical MacBooks being overpriced. In terms of functionality first year engineering you can use any laptop and I did find quite a lot of ppl had MacBooks but not too sure how it is in later on since I just finished yr1 in software. But there is probably a high chance you\u2019ll need a windows at some point in your degreee for a program",

Keep in mind, you aren't required to do the work on your personal device, labs come equipped with computers. I used my personal device for times I couldn't do the work on campus computers.",

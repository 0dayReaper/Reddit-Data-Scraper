    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI live in Ottawa where I arrived two months ago with my family as a protected person. We all have high School Diplomas from our home country and we would like to have them evaluated and see if we can apply at Carleton with the credits we have. I've searched online and I found several but they are very expensive, so I was wondering if any of you knows where I could have them evaluated for a low cost or even better for free. Would it be possible to have it done directly at Carleton?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

Generally universities will look at the equivalent to OSSD (Ontario Secondary School Diploma) so if you have something equivalent from your country, it should be fine. Your best bet is to contact admissions and they can look over what credits you have that would be equivalent.",

    "postText": "Up until now I\u2019ve only taken 3 COMP courses a semester, but I think if I want to get my third year courses done and graduate on time, I\u2019ll have to do 4 of them in the winter term (I\u2019m on co-op in the fall). Currently my draft schedule is\n\nCOMP 3000 - Operating Systems with Lianying Zhao\n\nCOMP 3005 - Database Management Systems with Ahmed El-Roby\n\nCOMP 3007 - Programming Paradigms with Robert Collier\n\n1 English elective\n\nWould adding either COMP 3004 or 3804 as my fifth course be too much? And if not, which of the two would be best to take? 3004 is with Rabe Abdalkareem and 3804 is with Michiel Smid. \n\nThe other two third year CS courses I need are 3203 and 3008, which either aren\u2019t being offered or don\u2019t fit my schedule. An alternative option would be to take 3203, 3008, 3005 and one of 3004 or 3804 in the Fall 2024 term as it might be a more manageable workload, but it doesn\u2019t work as well with my minor since I\u2019d have to use a winter elective for something unrelated.\n\nI\u2019d appreciate any advice (on profs or course sequencing)!",

I took 3005 with Mengchi so can\u2019t say much about it but it\u2019s also not a tough course. If you were comfortable and had some free time when you took 3 comp courses you should be fine with 4 but it will be stressful. I can\u2019t tell about 3004 but 3804 is pretty tough and assignments are time consuming.",

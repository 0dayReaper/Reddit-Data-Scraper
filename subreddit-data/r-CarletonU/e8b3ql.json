If you experience a SIGNIFICANT deterioration of health that causes ACUTE symptoms that prohibit you from completing the exam, or are informed of a domestic emergency, turn in your exam paper and inform an invigilator that you are unable to continue. You will then receive additional instructions.\n\nEvery word is ingrained in my head. At this point it's practically a sing-along.",

You may place any small bags and valuables underneath your seat. If during the exam you become aware that have unauthorized materials on your person such as a cell phone or calculator you should inform examination staff immediately.\n\n \n\nDuring the exam, you are not allowed to communicate with any other student.\n\n \n\nYou may not bring any food or drink with you while writing an exam, with the exception of water in a sealed, transparent, nonbreakable, unlabelled container.\n\n \n\nPlease place your Carleton University campus card on your desk. 30 minutes after the exam has started, invigilators will be circulating to take attendance. You may not leave the exam room until you have signed in.\n\n \n\nIf during the exam you need to use the washroom, please bring your exam materials and campus card to the designated sign out location at the front. Bringing any electronic devices or unauthorized materials into the washroom is a violation of the exam rules.\n\n \n\nYou are expected to complete a final examination once begun. If, while the exam is in progress, you experience a significant deterioration of health causing acute symptoms that prohibit you from completing the exam and require immediate and/or emergency medical attention, or you are informed of a domestic emergency and are unable to complete the examination, you must hand in your answer books at once to an invigilator and inform the invigilator that you are unable to continue.\n\n \n\nPlease make sure you write your student name, student number, date, course code, credit card number, expiration month and year, and the 3 digits on the back on all exam materials.\n\n \n\nGood luck and you may begin.",

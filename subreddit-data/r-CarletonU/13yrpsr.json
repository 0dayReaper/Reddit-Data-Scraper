I am now on the competition list and waiting for my security screening to be completed \u2014 I submitted those documents March of 2022! \n\nI applied to various government jobs, the majority of which in December 2022. Some only responded by March/April. Some earlier, but each step in the process seemed to take about a month. A couple rejections, but I am still waiting on 2-3 jobs.\n\nI applied for a senior analyst position with CIHI, a crown corporation but not government, May 5th. I received a call May 18th and had an interview setup by May 26th. Today (June 2nd), they sent me a conditional offer depending on the feedback from my references. \n\nHaving been gaslit by the sluggishness of the government, I am flabbergasted at the speed of CIHI.\n\nA month is nothing.",

Your own section is definitely a COI; how do you demarcate between emails, office hours, and tutoring? \"Sorry student, but you'll have to pay me $50 if you want to learn more about surface integrals.\" You also know the graded material, so people might suspect you are training students on the tested material, rather than on the material itself. \n\nThe second doesn't seem to be a COI unless it's a necessary requirement to pass the contracted course. And if it's orthogonal material, then it doesn't matter whatsoever. The accreditation is pretty different, too. \n\nMany CIs have jobs/studies outside of teaching. The university doesn't seem to care unless it negatively affects the quality/ability of course delivery.",

    "postText": "I was admitted to Carleton software Eng. (this fall, first year). I am an international student so I have satisfactory language skills but I have never obtained so much information in English. I reckon i will need some time to get used to society and new first language, and I think I should not take too difficult electives in the first semester for my better experience. Maybe some of you can tell about first year courses (except for COMP, MATH and BUSI) which haven't been tough and too busy for you so my adaptation period won't be too harsh and stressful if I take some of them.\n\nAlso I would be happy to hear about your experience in merging into Carletons community and maybe a little word of advice if you have one.",

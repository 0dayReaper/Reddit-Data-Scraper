There's a website here with a PDF that you can download which goes over some of the requirements: https://admissions.carleton.ca/applicant-type/canadian-college-graduates-or-transfer-students/\n\nSeems like between a 3.0 and a 3.7 is needed (B to A-), which means it likely varies year to year based on how many applications as well as which specific engineering you're going into (Aero is more competitive for example)",

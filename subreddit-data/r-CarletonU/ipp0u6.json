When I first came to Canada, I could see Dunton tower from my apartment window, especially at night with its red light. \n\nThe way the tower lights up in the sunset is one of my favourite views, and I think everyone finds it recognizable. \n\nMy favourite view on campus, though, is from the new parts of Herzberg. They look onto the river, through the trees, it's so beautiful.",

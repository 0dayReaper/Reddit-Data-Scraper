    "postText": "The title says it. I was accepted to UTM for CS today, though I know it's not really an acceptance because of the POST system they have there. They offered me a 3k nonrenewable scholarship as well. Going to UTM would be no more than a 30 min commute daily, but I personally do not think I can make post. I have older friends who are much smarter academically than me and put more effort into their studies who failed to make post and are considering transferring to Ryerson.\n\nOn the other hand, I was accepted to Carleton cs back in April with a 12k scholarship (3k renewable) with co-op. I'd have to move to Ottawa though. My dad is okay with it, but my mom isn't. She's really hard to convince.\n\nThere will probably be some bias because this is the Carleton subreddit, but what school is better from a program standpoint? And how is studying at Carleton? Is the entrance scholarship easy or difficult to maintain, etc?",

I don't think any of that matters since they are all great and it's up to you to make the most out of your degree. Wish someone told me this before I started CS but 90% of the things you take away from your degree are things you learned/explored on your own.\n2. Studying at Carleton is great. Nice self-contained campus. I wish there were better options for the food though...\n3. Entrance scholarships should be easy to maintain. If you get A's in your first year don't start to slack off. That's where a lot of people run into trouble.\n\nI think the most important factors would be university lifestyles and COOP. If you want to come to a new city and start fresh then it could be a great opportunity.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m looking at the admission offers I\u2019ve received and just had a question regarding some of the programs offered at Carleton. I\u2019ve been accepted in the Business Law program but my plan is to take premed science courses in my electives. I know this isn\u2019t the traditional route for medicine or dentistry, but I thought I\u2019d get a degree in something I\u2019m actually interested in instead of the traditional biology/health sciences. Is anyone here currently on the premed track or pre dental in a non science major? If so, how\u2019s you find the course-load managing major requirements and prerequisites for medical school? My main concern is enrolling in science courses as someone who isn\u2019t majoring in something science-based, is it easy enrolling in science courses or would science majors have a priority over me? Also, could I just minor in something outside of my discipline altogether like Biology? Thank you all in advance!",

As long as you take prerequisites, I think the best bet is to do something you actually like so your GPA will be solid. Business law is a great idea if you like it but law anything can be a lot if you don\u2019t love it.",

So, any degree can be versatile if you're resourceful and motivated.\n\nThat being said, I think most jobs for that undergrad would pay $40-70k starting out, then 70-100k in the medium term, and 100k+ longterm. Not bad, not great. I think it's the type of degree that serves you better if you plan on doing an graduate degree.",

I just want a degree which isn\u2019t purely biology so that I have a plan B in case medical school isn\u2019t what I end up pursuing down the line. I\u2019m sure that medicine is what I want to do, and I can\u2019t see myself doing anything else; but I don\u2019t want to be naive in thinking that I\u2019ll for sure get into a medical school considering the competitiveness.",

You only have to meet the admission requirements to be considered. Also, GPA is really important for med school admissions so choosing a program that you enjoy and can easily get high grades in isn\u2019t a bad idea.",

    "postText": "Currently at laurier cs. I know everyone says the school doesn't matter, work on side projects and leetcode. But I'm thinking about transferring to carleton. I think it would be a better atmosphere with a nicer campus, more diverse student body (program-wise, and ethnicity wise). At Laurier just feels like cs students are second class citizens to the business program. I'm not happy with the quality of profs at wlu, and also the course offerings are very general in upper years, I want to learn about different specializations, a school like Western/Carleton offers that. Also the co-op program at Laurier is quite weak for CS, almost all the same opportunities are found by applying externally. If anyone has any input that would be greatly appreciated.",

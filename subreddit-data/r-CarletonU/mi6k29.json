I would've liked to evaluate 3 font choices and pair them separately with each logo. Also, I don't think anyone is going to get that those lines are the canal unless they've been here. \n\nI'll be pretty annoyed if when I get my diploma it looks like I got a Ph.D. from Petro Canada. I can just imagine the jokes now. \"Does that stand for Petroleum has Depleted? Did they give you that as employee of the month?\"",

It had the cost of arms that we all seem to want to have as the new logo. It looked to be awarded this decade. So hopefully the parchments stay that way. We gotta hang these proudly in our office and not be embarrassed by them...",

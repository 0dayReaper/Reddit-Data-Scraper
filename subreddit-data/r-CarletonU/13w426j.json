I\u2019m getting an error on my time sheet which I can try to override. Is there any chance this will be allowed?\nThanks.",

Not guaranteed it'll 100% happen but I know some of my friends have gotten it to work before.\n\nWinter only prereqs are one of the more annoying part of the eng curriculum. If you fail or missed a class because it's full, you gotta wait for a whole other year.",

Defend yourself and your knowledge of the prerequisite course content like your degree depends on it (both in the override and in the email to program advisor if it comes to that).\n\nIf you have high marks in the prerequisite\u2019s prerequisites, say that (humbly). If you have non-academic experience with the content, say that. Without a doubt, communicate that the course is rarely offered and that should go far.",

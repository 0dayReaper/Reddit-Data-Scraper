I am able to login to it but whenever I click on Carleton Central it takes me to another tab and tells me to setup an MC1 account. I\u2019ve set it up already but it still keeps taking me to the setup tab whenever I click on Carleton Central. Does anyone know why this keeps happening? I want to accept my residence offer but I can\u2019t, any help is appreciated.",

    "postText": "Considering the whole master's program is 5 of these courses and the thesis over two years, are they considerably harder than undergrad courses?\n\nI got accepted for the accelerated master's, and I'm looking at my scheduling options. \n\nRight now it looks beneficial to have both of the MCS courses in my winter term alongside my last two BCS courses and honors thesis so I could work in the fall. However, I'm worried that I may be incorrectly estimating these MCS courses (and the half of the thesis credit) as being equivalent in load to a BCS course.\n\nAs a benchmark, last term I reasonably managed 5 courses (all COMP/CGSC/MATH) and a TAship. It was definitely the upper end of the load I could handle, but it was doable. Is the plan I outlined above feasible?",

            "comment": "As a very rough rule of thumb a graduate level class is about double the amount of work as an undergraduate class. But of course it will vary a lot depending on your specific abilities in the course material. In general though, expect to do a lot more reading and writing in graduate school compared to coding. Many classes will have some kind of literature review as knowing the literature is vital for doing research and getting publications.",

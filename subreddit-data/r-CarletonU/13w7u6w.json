            "comment": "If you can, tour both campuses, and that will definitely help you make a decision. I have friends who toured both campuses and decided to not attend uOttawa because of the atmosphere on campus, and I personally chose Carleton because of my first visit to Campus. I also know people who really enjoyed their time at uOttawa during their Undergrad or Masters.\n\nCarleton has a very diverse student body, and an *actual* campus which is semi-removed from the city (so you don't see a lot of non-students on campus) while still being on a main road (Bronson). It's very accessible via public transit, bike, or car, and will be even more so when the construction on the O-Train is finished. \n\nI really love Carleton's campus for the scenery, and disliked uOttawa's campus for how much it *feels* like its just a part of downtown because of its vicinity to Byward. I felt like uOttawa was just kinda part of the city, but Carleton really felt like it's own distinct area of the city. \n\nThe diversity of students, groups and clubs at Carleton also give you lots of opportunities to connect with people of similar interests no matter what they are. If you're not someone who is looking to make friends, your social scene will always suck regardless of where you go; and the opposite is also true. I am sure uOttawa also has great opportunities to connect with other students, but I can only speak from my experiences at Carleton.\n\nA BCS from uOttawa vs Carleton would be considered equal when you graduate, unless there is a specific stream or courses that would pull you to either university. You'll be spending a LOT of time on campus over the next few years, so that's how I would recommend you split your decision. \n\nAlso consider you'll eventually be living off campus, and can cater the area you live in more to the area of the city you'd like to spend your free time in. Carleton is accessible by many buses that run downtown, center town, or to the more suburby/residential parts of the city as well. So lots of options no matter where you are looking to live longer term as a student.\n\nBut good luck on your choice, I hope you enjoy whichever university you choose to attend!",

            "comment": "May be biased but Carleton imo is more social and in a better location. Have friends at uOttawa who often come to Carleton parties as a lot of the people who go to uottawa live downtown and the campus doesn\u2019t really feel like a \u201ccampus\u201d. Carleton on the other hand is right next to the canal and located on a island pretty much so imo it\u2019s a better location than the downtown core.",

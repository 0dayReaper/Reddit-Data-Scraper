All for roughly $26.76/hr (2023 pay post strike)\n\nIt was definitely doable and I don't regret it at all because I connected with a lot of others through it. I'd say, try it out and see if its for you. You get an email a couple months before the start of the semester on how to apply and requirements. \n\nGood luck!",

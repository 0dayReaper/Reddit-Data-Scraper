    "postText": "I have in a 2-bed 2-bath but I haven't been living in my unit because of roommate issues. I'm pretty sure utilities in the common room are divided between roommates and then the utilities within the bedroom are paid separately. My utility fee has been insane (average $85/mo) and I don't even occupy the private living space. I'm just curious what other people are paying?",

We don\u2019t turn the lights on often, we use lamps and even then now that it\u2019s lighter out we barley turn those on. I have a 10-20 minute hot shower almost every day, we sue the dishwasher once or twice a week and same with the washer dryer. We\u2019re also a 2 bed and 2 bath unit",

Unfortunately, although these new buildings look great, they\u2019re not subject to rent control, as they were built/occupied for residential purposes after November 2018. I guess a good option would be to look for buildings that still fall under rent control, otherwise we\u2019ll always be at risk of these greedy companies unreasonable increases.",

    "postText": "Hello! I have just finished my BA at Carleton and I am now moving on to start my MA in international affairs (Norman Patterson School of International Affairs).\n\nI am interested in a policy career in the public service and I am trying to develop skills to supplement my degree that will broaden my job options, like learning French and eventually other languages. My MA program includes economics &amp; statistical training too. \n\nI have read that experience in data analysis is useful for many positions. I have historically been very bad at math and foundational economic/ statistical principles don\u2019t come to me naturally. Just a quick search of certificate programs in Ontario require previous experience with coding platforms and math for admission. These will be too advanced for me to begin. I\u2019ve seen boot camp programs popping up all over the place recently and they claim they\u2019re for beginners but they tend to get bad reviews and seem like a cash grab.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this and any advice on how I could go about obtaining these data skills? Is there anything Carleton offers to help with this? Thanks!\n\n(Note: I\u2019m not looking to be a data scientist or anything. That\u2019s way outside my prospects and requires an entire degree in the subject. I\u2019m just looking for ways I can learn and show employers that I have valuable data analysis skills).",

            "comment": "If math is not your strong point don\u2019t despair. Also note that there is no substitute for experience. If you want to get better at analysis you need to analyze real problems to grow in that domains. Use coop and internships to do that because it will provide context that will help you see what you learn in school differently and give you the opportunity to ask questions while still in the university on how to reconcile the problems that you may encounter when trying to practically apply your learning.\n\nFor analysis in the workplace there are normally different roles in that process. The obvious one is people who make up the mathematical formulas that support the models used to analyze data. If your not great with math this might not be your strong point.\n\nThe other type which I think is far more common is the  people who model an approach for the exploration and analysis of problems. This does require an understanding of the mathematical processes available so you know your options. However, their value is in being able to understand the problem domain enough to identify and abstract out the parts of the problem they can model that can be helpful in analysis. The most important thing there is how much you know about the problem domain and your experience in that area. Your math knowledge helps you understand what the information in your model means and what it doesn\u2019t. This is useful for determining how much each result may affect your hypothesis.\n\nSo don\u2019t freat. We live in a world rich with data and success can be found by providing valuable work in any part of the process. You don\u2019t need to be able to do it all. Your bachelors just taught you a bit of everything. Find the part your good at and work in that area.",

Khan Academy.\n\nJust to get your foot in the door, it might be useful to watch some youtube videos on the fundamentals of econometrics. It's hard to tell if you'll even be needing that level of statistical analysis but knowing it's out there may help. This is where the coding comes in.",

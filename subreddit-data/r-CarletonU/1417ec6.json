Does it mean, that I could not register my timetable before the response from department about my request? Or it would be registered but without course causes request. \nPlease, could anybody explain how this whole thing works.\nWhat should I expect to happen after trying to register a timetable which contains a course requires an override request? And what should I do next?",

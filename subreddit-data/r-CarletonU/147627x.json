    "postText": "**What is this protest?**\n\nA recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users.\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader. This also has implications for users who rely on these apps for accessibility reasons.\n\nEven if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this may be a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.\n\nOn June 12th, [thousands](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) subreddits will be going dark to protest this policy with hundreds more already dark. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app.\n\n**When exactly will /r/CarletonU go dark?**\n\nWe are going dark as soon as I wake up on June 12th, with the earliest possibility of reopening being 48 hours latest. However, there is a potential the blackout lasts longer.\n\n\n**Why is /r/CarletonU participating?**\n\nWe recently held a [poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarletonU/comments/1469qpr/poll_should_rcarletonu_participate_in_the_black/) in which an overwhelming majority of our users voted in favor of participating in the blackout. As of the moment I write this, we have had 350 votes, with over half of them in favor of participating. [Here is the full breakdown of the votes.](https://imgur.com/a/hz9VyrO) \n\n**What will happen after 48 hours?**\n\nAfter 48 hours we are going to re-evaluate. As this is a dynamic situation our decision moving forward will be based on how Reddit reacts to this protest. Our decision could be anything from staying private, to going into restricted posting mode, or opening back up. We have full intention of re-opening the subreddit as soon as possible assuming Reddit is willing to work with it's communities in terms of restoring our faith in their leadership, and offering a more equitable solution to the API issues. \n\n**Discord**\n\nIn the meantime, if you need support from other students or the online community of Carleton University, you can check out the discord server [here.](https://discord.gg/CarletonU)\n\n**What can individual users do to help support the protest?**\n\n* Complain. Message the mods of r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a support request: comment in relevant threads on r/reddit, such as this one, leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.\n\n* Spread the word. Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat.\n\n* Boycott and spread the word...to Reddit's competition! Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWith that, I want to thank everyone who voted and expressed opinions on this issue. We look forward to reopening this subreddit as soon as possible, and appreciate the patience. Good bye /r/CarletonU for now, until we see you on the other side! If you have any questions feel free to message me, or the modmail directly.",

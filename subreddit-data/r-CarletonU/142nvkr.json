    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am graduating this month. I am planning to buy some crewnecks and hoodies from the Carleton bookstore. In an email, I saw: \u201cCarleton University Bookstore. Please visit them at: bkstr.com/carletonstore/home for details.\u201d. I couldn\u2019t really find any details so I was just wondering if this discount would apply to me as of yet or should I just wait until I graduate? I\u2019m fine to buy regardless of the discount, but I just thought I would inquire if it could possibly save me money lol",

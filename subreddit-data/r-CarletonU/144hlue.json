    "postText": "Im stuck debating if I should go to convocation next week or not. I am torn between not going due to other responsibilities I have that day, and have never personally felt like I need convocation to prove the height of my achievement anyway. We still get our diplomas and pictures but the ceremony has never appealed to me. My family has been acting harsh because they see it as \"an event I owe to them\" (even though they weren't particularly present/supportive during my enrollment). And I'm stuck  \nWhat are some opinions you guys have about attending convocation ceremony? Is it something most students see a universally positive experience in? Or have any graduates here skipped it in favour of another celebration without regret? ",

All my siblings either didn't go to their convocations or refused to invite my parents, so my parents are happy that I invited them to mine. I'm just happy that they're actually planning to attend because they've said for years that they wouldn't go to my ceremony. My parents gave me some financial support, but they rarely give me any emotional support so I'll take what I can get.",

Mine were not super interested because it\u2019s not significant for them - they have 3/4 degrees each - but even so. If you don\u2019t want to go just don\u2019t.",

And my MA I went because I wanted to be hooded by my supervisor. \n\nI'll go to my PhD one just to wear the nicer robes and have my diss announced.\n\nOtherwise convocations are long, hot, boring, and pricey (if you're buying the shitty pics of you behind the scenes, or purchasing your degree framed for you). Be prepared to sit through a couple hours of speeches and music and honorary degrees just to have your 5 seconds on the stage. The reception after is insanely crowded and if you're lucky you'll get a shitty cupcake or two.\n\nBy all means, do it if you want. It is one rite of passage. But don't let your fam pressure you into it if you don't want to waste an entire day doing it.",

            "comment": "&gt; My family has been acting harsh\n\nThe one and only good thing the pandemic gave me was the excuse to skip mine. Sitting for hours to wait your turn sounds like a waste of time. If you are not keen on going, then don't go. I can see a moral reason to go only if your parents paid a significant portion of your studies or if neither parents went to university. I think time is well spent if you had lunch or a hangout as a celebration instead. You can also get a grad photo without attending graduation if all they want is a graduation picture. Most humans only post grad photos that have a plain background and not a photo of them or their kids in a graduation gown with random humans and messy scenery behind them.\n\nI have zero regrets and I wouldn't want to waste vacation to attend one when they recently asked me if I wanted to attend one since I missed mine due to the pandemic. I have no plans on attending my next one either. Parents are difficult to deal with as they will probably nag at you to go. I have excuses already lined up for not to go such as them being unhappy that I decided to get another degree just because I got bored at work.",

Meanwhile I had attended and completed  my MA from Ottawa U. I was still pissed with Carleton and did not go to convocation, but went over the next day to pick up my diploma and a transcript to take over to Ottawa U to prove I actually had a BA( Hons) from Carleton. OU had this strange idea that you had to have a BA before they\u2019d hand you an MA) My mother was very disappointed that she could not see her oldest child graduate- I was probably wrapped up in my own annoyance with Carleton to note how important it was to her. ( My dad was away in Geneva on business but he was very pleased I accomplished something) \n\nI did make some amends. I immediately went over to Ottawa U and signed up for convocation to receive my Master\u2019s the following week. Mom and my great-aunt were there and happily posed  for some pictures outside the National Arts Centre . At least they got to see me walk across a stage and receive my diploma.\n\nMoral in this long story: determine what attending convocation might mean to those who supported you and want to see the results of their efforts as well as yours.\ud83d\ude00",

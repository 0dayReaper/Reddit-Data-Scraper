It's not phenomenal by any means: some fellow residents can be j\\*ck\\*sses and even if you're in your own unit, the walls aren't necessarily soundproof (I can often hear my neighbours sneeze, yell and play music). But the amenities are great, the apartment units look nice and most of the staff are quite friendly. I would suggest it, but look at a group of other options before going towards the Revalie.",

To answer your questions, I personally have found my neighbours to be quiet, it is technically smoke free but hasn\u2019t stopped people from smoking cigarettes or weed on the property. All management has done is send out emails, but my hallway still smells like weed. \n\nI will say I\u2019m entering my third year, and my roommate and I are already thinking about moving out next year. We\u2019ve already re-signed out leases for the upcoming school year, but the rent increase was a little much. Again it\u2019s a nice place, but as the other commenter said, nothing phenomenal. We mainly picked this place because it put our parents at ease to see how secure the building was, and that it wasn\u2019t rundown or in a sketchy area.\n\nI would consider looking into other places, but the Revalie is by no means bad.",

You know fixed term leases become month to month at the end, right? That would have been a lot better since you could have just moved out with 60 days notice if you suddenly found something more convenient mid-year.\n\nIf they didn't even give you a discount you got a bit screwed there...",

But if they pay for 4-5 months of month-to-month rent before moving out, then I suspect that it would have cost them more than if they just went with a full 1 year contract. They deliberately want you to take the full year contract so that you're stuck with it for a full year",

Being month to month would be the same thing (you can stay for as long as you want), while being held to only provide 60 days notice to move out. \n\nYou become month to month automatically after a fixed term lease ends, so I don't see the advantage of re-newing a lease.",

You can do a month-to-month lease at the Revalie, but the problem is that your monthly price would increase compared to if you did a full 1 year lease. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo take myself as an example, I am currently under the original pricing, which is 1399$ for rent of a bachelor-style apartment- I've done a full 1 year lease for each year that I've lived here. For the upcoming year I renewed before the first deadline, which was November 15th, which means that my monthly rent will only increase by 5% starting in September. If someone were to do a month-to-month, their monthly rent comparative to their previous lease would increase by 12% per month. Therefore, in OP's case, going from a yearly lease to a month-by-month would lead to a substantial increase in their monthly rent, compared to if they just signed a new one-year lease.",

It's not just the tenants that smoke in the courtyard (and in the building) but random high school kids are scattered about smoking pot too. \n\nYou may get lucky with your neighbours being quiet, but most likely not. My experience there was constant disturbance, but to be fair I had a roommate who was running what seemed like a literal nightclub in our shared 2 bedroom unit. Multiple complaints from our neighbours - you could be one of them! Best of luck. \n\nThe location also sucks. It's not close to any convenience stores, shopping centers, grocery stores, or... anything at all. The only place it's convenient to get to is Carleton, and that's only if you can make it on the shuttle. Again, best of luck.\n\nThe absolute worst part of The Revalie though, and something you can't really escape, is the management. If you never have an issue living there, it's a half-decent (albeit expensive!) place to live, but if you ever have any problems there, do not expect management to care or do anything to help you. The front desk people are chronically useless, and the management they work for are an even bigger joke. \n\nIf you want an honest opinion from someone who lived there for a while - look elsewhere. You can find much better, safer, more comfortable, and much cheaper places to live than The Revalie.",

    "postText": "I am in my last year of software engineering, and was looking for some feedback choosing the electives. So far the options I am considering are COMP 3008, COMP 3002, SYSC 3200 and SYSC 4102. I have already taken SYSC 4504.\n\nSpecifically looking for feedback on SYSC 4102 as there is little information available for this course. \n\nAre there any other options I should be considering?",

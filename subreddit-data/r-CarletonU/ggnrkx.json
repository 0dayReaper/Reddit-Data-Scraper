I decided to delete the part about racism at OttawaU because it didn't feel morally correct to \"memeify\" such issue. My apologies to anyone who was offended by that.\n2. The point of this post is to point out the massive insecurity over at OttawaU. I am not arguing that Carleton is better in any way, I am just saying that it's utterly dumb to roast Carleton for things you are yourself guilty of.\n3. Don't make jokes about suicide. It might be tempting to make them because \"meme war\" but please, just don't do it.",

Just look at the national and international rankings of both schools and you will know what I am talking about. Employers will take uOttawa grads over Carleton grads any way. \n\nCarleton is horrible, if you graduated from Carleton, be prepared to be unemployed for the rest of your life because no employer would ever hire from a shitty school like Carleton.",

We badly need higher order transit on Montreal Rd, and frequent busses all around. The O-train as it exists works better than most people give it credit for, and shitting on it 24/7 won't get us better transit. I would love if it was designed, built and maintained more competently, but transit doomerism does nothing but harm.\n\nRunning a dedicated bus from Carleton to Vanier will only spread resources even thinner and does not serve Vanier as a whole, only Carleton students living in Vanier (Algonquin and uO exist too, let alone normal people with jobs). Don't sell the entirety of Vanier short so you can have a one seat ride to school.\n\nWhile we're at it, can we get some sort of enclosure at Bayview? Waiting to transfer from the 1 to the 2 was always freezing. Absurd to have heated enclosed bus shelters but nothing at the biggest transfer point on the network.",

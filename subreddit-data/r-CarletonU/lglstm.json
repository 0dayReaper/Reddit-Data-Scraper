He was helpful and insightful and had no interest in making the course intentionally hard.\n\nHe chooses to make his undergraduate course be brutal. You can argue that still makes him a bad teacher perhaps. But for what it's worth, he isn't inherently a bad teacher.\n\nI am preparing myself to be annihilated with downvotes lol",

I personally haven\u2019t had john rodgers as a teacher so i can\u2019t say much over than second hand opinions. \n\nNasser on the other hand is useless. He gave out an assignment but refused to give the TAs the marking scheme prior to the due date. He wanted us to write a process using a certain function but didn\u2019t say anything regarding doing it differently. TAs not knowing they had us write it the easier but gave you an automatic 50% deduction to the overall grade of the  assignment. We had an hour long argument with him regarding it where he told us that we need to use our heads and that it was our fault for not thinking.\n\nBlows my mind that he meets teaching standards",

I had 3509 with him and it was brutal, it was way harder than it needed to be, and his mandatory attendance quizzes were definitely pretty unnecessary. But as soon as I was past 3rd year undergrad he did a complete 180. \n\nHe was my 4th year capstone supervisor and he was fantastic. Very helpful, made it interesting, was quick to offer his knowledge, and genuinely wanted all of us to succeed in his project. He was surprisingly a really nice guy.\n\nI'm currently in is grad course as well, and it's the same thing, he's one of the best profs I've had. He's really helpful and insightful, and is quick to answer all my questions. His course is by no means easy, but he isn't making it excessively hard like he did with 3509. He definitely has the capacity to be a great professor as most people that take his grad course see, but he chooses to make his undergrad course harder than it needs to be\n\nThe one thing about him that I really want to know, what's with all the clocks?? There's like a dozen clocks going off at all times during his lecture recordings",

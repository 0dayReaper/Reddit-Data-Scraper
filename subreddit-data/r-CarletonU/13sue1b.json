    "postText": "The first co-op job I applied to was the one that I thought was most interesting and in line with my goals. I was returned with the \"Not Selected for Interview\" status, which checks out as in hindsight it wasn't a good application. The deadline passed, the listing went down, and I was disappointed but it's to be expected.\n\nSince then I've rebuilt my resume and cover letter style, and now have a much stronger application that has gotten traction elsewhere. However, the original position has stuck in my head. They just relisted the job (I assume the first wave of applicants didn't pan out), and I think if at the start I had submitted what I have now I would've had a shot. However, the only way to reapply to the new listing would be to cancel my application and resubmit (if this even works - I can't tell if there's a built-in bock to this on the website).\n\nMy gut reaction is that reapplying would be a bad idea and be looked at as unprofessional, but I'm also extremely interested in this job and if there's a chance to retry without looking incredibly boorish I want to take it.\n\nSo, what are all your thoughts on if I should let sleeping dogs lie or try to submit again?",

Even if they did they will probably see it as someone who has made efforts to improve their application and I see no reason for them to hold it against you. As someone else said, the worst-case scenario is they don't hire you and you are no further behind than you are right now.",

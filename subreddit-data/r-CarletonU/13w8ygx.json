    "postText": "Hi there, I have been wanting to get a parking spot for the summer. I signed up on the site and I see that the parking under the libarary is only accessible after 5pm. Since they specified a set time for parking in the library garage, would I also be restricted to time slots to access the parking spot that I got a permit for or is it open at any time during the semester?",

Even if I got any information regarding it in the mean time would help (maybe even hear things I might have not been told about by parking services). A lot of parking spots were sold out for the summer and I figured I would ask the community.",

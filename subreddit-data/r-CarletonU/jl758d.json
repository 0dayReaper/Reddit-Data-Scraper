    "postText": "Hey Ravens,\n\nMatt Gagne your CASG President here!\n\nI have an exciting update regarding grade reform:\n\nToday at the Carleton senate meeting we passed 3 motions for a compassionate grading policy for this year!\n\nThe first was that all failed courses would be converted to an UNSAT credit to not affect your GPA. \n\nThe second is the delay of all punitive academic performance evaluations until the next academic year. This means in a typical year, you would be asked to drop a concentration or switch majors due to your grades; those decisions won't be made this year.\n\nAnd finally, after a lot of advocacy on our end, we got the senate to approve a 0.5 credit SAT designation for the fall semester. This means if you get a D because you've been feeling overwhelmed with your courseload or had to miss an assignment because you've been working more, you can switch one passed course this semester to satisfactory, so it does not impact your GPA.\n\nI want to thank my fellow student leaders for helping push for this, and it's so great to see how much of an impact we were able to have. \n\nThe work is not done, though. We're still working with the university to review the way courses have been delivered this semester in hopes that the winter semester can have far less speed bumps along the way. \n\nLet me know what you would like to see or what challenges you face. \nPlease email me, at president@casg.ca. I'm here to work for you. \n\nI hope these changes to grading can help put many of our minds at ease as we continue to deal with the stresses of this pandemic.\n\nStay safe, Ravens! Remember to wear a mask and help flatten the curve!\n\nHappy Halloween!! \ud83d\udc7b\nMatt",

I mean, if you've got a kid who's never ridden a bike before, you don't put them on a 2-wheeler and expect them to figure it out. You give them training wheels at first so that they learn to bike until they're reading to have them taken off. The same applies here - no one can expect students who've never taken any online classes before to thrive or fully succeed in a completely online semester. By giving them a safety net like the ones above prevents them from getting completely screwed over and gives them the time they need to adapt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; We had to retrain almost 50% of our hires from this term's batch because of no practical experience.  \n\nIt's a pandemic. Students aren't going to get the practical experience they need without being in a classroom and that's currently not a safe option. That's not the students' faults, and whether schools are compassionate or uncompassionate with their grading is not going to affect this whatsoever.\n\nThe academic quality is going to decline, but that has nothing to do with reforms with leniency. It's because this is a highly unusual situation and the universities are still struggling to adapt themselves. Compassion and leniency for those struggling isn't at fault, and is really the only thing that's going to keep students afloat right now.",

It doesn't.

Students cant learn if they're kicked out of their program or cant afford to come back because they lost their scholarships. That is just a fact. The university isnt bribing students, its keeping them in school. Big difference.\n\nLook, I think you're vastly exaggerating the effects of these decisions, so let's look at them.\n\nMaking all failed classes UNSAT: this protects students GPAs, which in turn protects them from being kicked out of their program or losing scholarships. They still failed the class and have to retake it. \n1 SAT class: So 1 grade gets ignored on GPA. Again prevents being kicked out/losing scholarships. This is 1 class. Most students take 5 a semester - the other 4 wont be erased and if the student is struggling on those, itll likely reflect on their GPA, and may affect their ability to graduate if they're not meeting standards.\nNo APE this year: students dont get kicked out because of a bad year where literally everyone else in the world is struggling. Graduating students will most likely still have to meet GPA standards to graduate, since that's a bit different than APE. If not, their ability to graduate will likely be based on last year's APE and grades dont typically have that much of a downward spiral.\n\nStudents are still expected to perform well and succeed this year. They're not getting free passes. They'll be prepared for the work force when they enter it. Leniency for students just takes into account external circumstances.\n\nAlso, work places can often be accommodating with unforeseen circumstances. A lot of employers have realized that shifting employees to working at home will affect their ability to perform and thus are taking that into account when evaluating employees. Employees arent getting free passes because of it, but a lot of employers are being compassionate during the current times.\n\nAs for your last point, no, they're not as ready as their seniors. But that's not because of leniency. That's because theres a pandemic going on and they cant get experience because of that. Leniency and compassionate grading does not in any way affect that.\n\nLook, this is a really, really difficult situation worldwide. Expecting ANYONE - student, worker, anyone - to meet the same standards they did under normal, less stressful and less complex circumstances, is unreasonable. Advocating against reasonable adjustments for students is holding them at unfair standards. Employers who expect them to be just as good as previous without the same opportunities for experience and learning under the extreme stress we all are dealing with have unrealistic expectations. And again, compassionate grading will not affect this whatsoever.",

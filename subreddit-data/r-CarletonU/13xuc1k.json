Especially in your first year, you'll want to have some time a part from each other whilst you make your own friends. Whereas when you room with someone new, the university will put you with someone who has similar habits to you, and it can be a bit easier to get along with them and eventually form a friendship with them (if that's something you both want). \n\nMost (but not all) of the people I know who roomed with a friend, ended up not being friends with that person after.",

I have seen it with my friends from campus and I have mediated many conflicts between roommates. I cannot stress this enough. People change in their first year of uni. Do not room with friends or lovers from high school. Full stop, no exceptions. The chances of problems are significantly higher if you have a pre-existing relationship with your roommate because people disrespect boundaries more if they already know the other person.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI was accepted into the Poli-Sci program at Carleton and Journalism program at U of T, and l'm really struggling to decide on which one I should accept.\n\nTo give a bit of personal context, I'm from North West Ontario, and have never visited Ottawa and have only visited Toronto briefly a few times, so I have little idea on the city life in both, though I\u2019ve heard Ottawa is more of a quiet city and all that. Both Universities are pretty much just as far, though in Ottawa I would probably feel a bit more secluded cause it's further away from my family, and a lot of my friends are going to uni in the Toronto area. None of this is anything major but it's just something extra to consider I guess.\n\nSo my biggest concerns for U of T is that the journalism program is smaller and only offered at the Scarborough campus which I haven't heard the best things about, though I would probably see if I could end up switching my major to Poli-Sci or maybe something like English/History after the first year and transfer to the SG campus unless I change my mind and enjoy it there. Then for Carleton, I know it obviously offers way better programs in Journalism and Poli-Sci (which I\u2019d probably dual major in if I go), but my concern is that its obviously a smaller school overall and offers less course options and opportunities, especially if I end up deciding on switching my major.\n\nI posted this on U of T but I wanted to see if anyone attending here had any insight on which one they think might be a better choice. Thank you so much and sorry about the longer post!",

Unless you are South of Lake Huron but still counting that as Northwestern Ontario?\n\nAlso, Carleton isn't that small. It's obviously small compared to UofT, but that is because UofT has 100k students, and so any university in Canada is small compared to it. Carleton is about a mid-sized school, comparable (in population) to McMaster in Hamilton.\n\nI would say pick Carleton since you'll have a greater chance at employability, larger (and more impressive) alumni network in polisci, and better access to the Feds.",

Weird shit happens in Toronto but everyone I've spoken to that went to UTSC enjoyed it. Unless you want to be downtown (and pay downtown rent), I wouldn't recommend switching campuses.",

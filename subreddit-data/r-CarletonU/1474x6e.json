Im only in my second year Electrical Eng, but I've been thinking about doing a Master's program or whatever the engineering equivalent is abroad, and I've been eyeballing the US. \n\nIf anyone knows the process of applying, what sort of documents you need, what kind or permits you need and all that stuff please do share whatever information you have, or point me at the right resources.

You should be advised that US residency is a terrible burden if you don't plan on staying, because you will likely be required to file US taxes for pretty much the rest of your life and the schools there are extraordinarily expensive. Additionally (without any engineering knowledge) there might be lower value attributed to a US certification outside the US because they like to have their own systems so much, in other fields like mine the knowledge/qualification doesn't transfer smoothly.",

I'm not saying funded masters are unheard of but they are fewer and farther between. Bachelor's to PhD is more common in the US and their grad programs *tend* to involve more course work than Canadian and international equivalents.",

    "postText": "So I thought I could register for the NPPE exam for hte fall since EIT's can write the test while they acquire hours. Apparently, now new Engineering grads according to PEO can't write the NPPE for 4 years, so whats the point of taking professional practice in 4th year if we have to forget it all and re write it in 4 years?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe whole process is supposed to be more transparent, but how do we get our engineering experience assessed? As new project coordinators, jr designers etc. whats the process? I'm afraid of getting to the 48 months and not having the right signature, right experience because im no longer eligble to apply as the old EIT system? \n\nThe whole PEO process now seems unequitable to local engineering graduates seeking licensure, and if someone can clarify it would be appreciated.",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t really have an answer tbh. It seems graduates this year (anyone who has their degree conferred after May 15 - June 2nd is the date Carleton approves their degrees for spring graduation) will not eligible for the current EIT program. As a recent graduate it seems we\u2019re all in the dark about the new process but that\u2019s true for companies aswell - they don\u2019t know how they will get their new hires (jr modellers, project managers, etc) to PEng. \n\nSo it sucks and I\u2019m pretty frustrated as-well but if it\u2019s asked on job applications or in interviews you can still say your seeking PEng. \n\nAlso your Professional Practice exams would be done at the end of 48 months anyway I think even under the old system - I just think they might be adding more technical exams in addition to the PP exam like in the US. For what\u2019s it\u2019s worth I\u2019ve been hearing from other engineers PEO is getting lots of pushback about this but we will just wait and see I guess lol.\n\nEdit: some of this is hearsay so take it at face value I guess",

However, I do want to note that prior to the changes, EITs could take the PPE exam anytime within their 48 months of gaining experience.\n\nEdit: Wanted to add on that I have 36 months of experience, and literally JUST signed up for my NPPE today for Sept 2023.",

Initially they asked us to  submit our documents before May 26, but now they extended it to July 14, which gives me ample time to submit my documents and pay the fee by July 28. \n\nIt was kind of a tricky situation since every job I want to apply for requires an EIT or someone applied to become one (at least) \n\nAnyone else in a similar situation?",

Then you are eligible to write the NPPE and within 180 days of your submission of your CBA you get an answer.\n\nI believe you can start your application now and get access to the portal. No doubt more resources are available.\n\nYou know, you can always apply in another province. You could get an EIT from say APEGS and then when you become a P. Eng. you could transfer to PEO and that transfer would be automatically accepted.\n\nNobody is forcing you to go through the PEO process.\n\n[https://techexam.ca/2022/12/how-to-choose-the-province-where-you-should-qualify-as-a-professional-engineer-for-technical-exams](https://techexam.ca/2022/12/how-to-choose-the-province-where-you-should-qualify-as-a-professional-engineer-for-technical-exams)",

It is not a standard equivalent to CEAB accreditation like the Washington Accord.\n\nThere has always been two equally valid paths to P. Eng. for both CEAB and non-CEAB graduates. For non-CEAB there are technical exams. It has been that way since CEAB accreditation was created in mid '60s.\n\nhttps://techexam.ca/2023/01/what-is-a-technical-exam-your-ladder-to-professional-engineer\n\nPEO has not lowered academic requirements.\n\nThey simply created a system where only graduates from foreign programs would be allowed to do technical examinations to bring them up to the CEAB standard.\n\nOn May 15, 2023 graduates of Canadian non-CEAB programs lost their technical exam route when applying to PEO. Apparently the rules of the IIDD database specifically disallow assessment of Canadian programs.\n\nThe motion you read simply recognizes that not allowing Canadian trained applicants to do technical exams is unfair and allows for studying the issue.\n\nUnfortunately that motion was defeated (10 for, 11 against) in March 2023.\n\nIt is possible for the motion to be reconsidered.\n\nObviously a system that specifically bars you for not what you learned but where you learned it is unconstitutional. The PEO is an entity empowered by the province and is therefore constrained by the Charter.",

New Canadian enigneering grads still cant register as PEO EIT's which enable us to write nppe earlier on, be in the loop with the association and in the system which then allows us just focus on hours after and that doesn't seem right. \n\nAfter taking professional practice law and ethics in 4th year, buying the book for the nppe which is also used in that 4th year course, and not being able to apply and be recognized as an engineer intern by the association, because they are finding themselves in terms of global educational equity isn't to me a good excuse to break the system for this years new grads. We experienced covid school, a strike like I'm looking for just some return to normal.\n\nAlberta, Sask, etc still allow us to register and be EIT's and I thank you for providing that info because I just was not aware of that rule. To me, I worked hard in the last 4 years and want the process started asap and to get my professional career on track, and not just be a bachelor degree holder waiting to join a Profesisonal Association down the line.\n\nMany people are left in the dark, and for me at least, tomorrow once conferred I'm signing up with the APEGA/APEGS cuz I don't trust the PEO right now to take care of me as an aspirant new grad. They've seemed not to be transparent and do not provide solutions and 1 liner feedback to my queries so i mean... go APEGA/APEGs.",

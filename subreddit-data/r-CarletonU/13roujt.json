    "postText": " I live in Ottawa and I'm having a really hard time deciding between the two.\n\nQueens pros:\n\n* Better reputation for grad school and more well known in Toronto (for job opportunities)\n* Engineering culture is very strong and supportive\n* Everyone lives on residence, so it's easier to make friends\n* More design teams and engineering clubs than carleton\n* Queens commerce kids are generally some of the top business students in Canada, so i can surround myself with smarter ppl\n* Outside of Ottawa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQueens cons:\n\n* I've heard the ECE department is highly unorganized and a lot of ECE profs are bad\n* Less diversity - I prefer talking to ppl from different backgrounds and getting different perspectives\n* No official co-op for the summers - only QUIP (I can find jobs on my own, so this isn't as big of a concern, but still smth to consider)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCarleton pros:\n\n* Really solid EE department with great funding and profs (from what I've heard)\n* Coop integrated into the program for the summer + a QUIP-style 12-16 month internship\n* Ottawa has many startups, but I could also apply to those from Queens\n* Focuses on chip-design in their curriculum, which interests me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCarleton cons:\n\n* Mostly a commuter school, so it would harder to make friends, even if I live on residence\n* In Ottawa, which I somewhat want to leave\n* Barely any clubs/design terms\n* In general, less ambitious students, whereas Queens has more students that want to go to US and have higher ambitions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of these are probably false assumptions, so correct me if I'm wrong, but based on these points, what do you recommend?",

            "comment": "I can\u2019t really give a recommendation, but I can say that most of your Carleton cons weren\u2019t my experience or the experience of a lot of people I know/knew. I lived in residence my first year and had no issues making friends. 6 years later and I still have the same core friend group despite us being scattered across Canada and in different stages of our lives. Carleton also has a ton of clubs, we have a yearly club fair that\u2019s huge and showcases the major clubs. I ended up finding all my clubs through friends, but I know lots of people who had major success finding clubs and people that really suited them through the fair. Also, at least in my department, there was a lot of ambition. In any group there will be a good chunk who don\u2019t care and will put in minimal effort, but most of the people I spoke to had ambitions for Master\u2019s/PhD\u2019s and had big research plans and stuff.",

Regardless of which uni you choose, if they have an orientation program (especially for engineering students specifically) try to sign up - they'll introduce you to all the clubs and give you a rundown on the engineering community. Carleton has EngFrosh which is awesome, student-run, and sponsored by like every engineering club. Idk what Queens has as an equivalent but definitely seek it out to make friends!",

Kingston is smaller than Ottawa and their transit system actually works and has GPS updates on Google maps. \n\nUltimately these Engineering programs are all the same due to standardization. Good luck finding a job immediately out of university though, my roommate just finished his EE at Carleton and is struggling to find work.",

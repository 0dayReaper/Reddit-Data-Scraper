    "postText": "So in my winter 2024 semester, I only have 2 courses remaining to complete. But the issue is, I want to still be a full-time student for a upass and to not be under-prioritized for TA selection.\n\nI\u2019ve already done Mysteries of the Mind and Natural History in my first year, therefore, does anyone have any suggestions for a 3rd course like those 2 for online asynchronous courses?\n\nAdded info: I\u2019m a 4th year Accounting student if that matters",

We cover generally the same topics, but can go into more detail and solve more sophisticated problems with Phys 1003.\n\nIn addition, Phys 1003 requires grade 12 physics, whereas 1007 does not (and is designed for people with no physics from high school).\n\nIf you want more information send me a DM\n\ncheers\n\nAndrew (he/him)",

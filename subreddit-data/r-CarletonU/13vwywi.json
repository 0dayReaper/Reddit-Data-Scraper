For both universities, I applied for Commerce with a specialization in Finance and co-op. \n\nAny feedback on co-op, the courses, electives, work load, etc. would be great! \n\nPlease help, thank you!",

These electives will be different at each school as they\u2019re based the specialties of that schools business faculty. \n\nBoth schools are in Ottawa and will likely have the same employers offering co-ops at each school. \n\nStandard work load for undergrad is 5 courses per semester (various slightly depending on major). \n\nIf you have some sort of idea as to what you want to do after graduating, or during your co-ops. Look up alumni on LinkedIn and see where they did co-ops and ended up right out of undergrad. \n\nTL;DR: Doesn\u2019t really matter, choose whichever is cheapest/offered you the most funding (if you got some) or has more alumni in areas you want to work on. Otherwise just go to the one like most.",

Personally I found Sprott to be way more community vibes like I wouldn\u2019t get lost in it or just be another student on their list. Helps that it\u2019s enclosed so you really get the feeling of a university campus vs downtown Ottawa with uottawa. And the Nicol building is home of Sprott it\u2019s brand new and so nice. \n\nAlso Carleton offered me a scholarship where Uottawa did not. \n\nUltimately I would do a tour of Both and talk to some advisors/student reps to see how you feel! \n\nThe MBA is easier to get into with Sprott (you don\u2019t need work experience) and they have a new Master of Finance program so something to consider long term.",

Hiring coop students from OttawaU was so so so much easier and better organized, I would highly recommend it all else being equal. \n\nthere are other pros for Carleton (location, friends, tunnel access, etc. these may be more personal) but in this specific issue, the Carleton coop program was very poor in my experience.",

Co-op for Carleton can be kinda weak for business students and I've had mixed experiences with finance profs even though they were all nice. I can't vouch for the upper level finance profs though because I'm in accounting.",

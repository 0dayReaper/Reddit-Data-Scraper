In general, I would be cautious about doing a course in which you have no interest because somebody on the internet said it was easy. For example, if you're into music, then taking the rudimentary music class (MUSI 1107, I think) might be a good pick.",

I also took a criminology course, a First Year seminar which was a ton of fun too. I also took a course called Politics of Migration which I really enjoyed and was fairly straight forward",

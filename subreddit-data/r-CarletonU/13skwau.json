I've seen many students take a supposedly easy course in which they were not interested only to be miserable and get a mediocre grade. In general, I would not recommend going over 5 courses unless there's a very compelling reason. For example, a course you simply cannot otherwise take because it is only offered every 2 years. Or a specialized study that is simply a must take course based on the subject being offered. Or it is the only way to graduate on time for a job offer/graduate school.",

In 3rd year Aero, you are scheduled to take 6 courses. In first year, you take about 7 courses per semester, but that includes 4 six week hellscapes and two 0 credit courses.\n\nNormally, that's max, but I have heard of people taking more. My advice is to extend your school year into the summer instead. I've never heard anyone say they are glad they took more than 5. They always regret it, myself included. When I took 6 courses, I got half great marks and half shit ones, ended up redoing two courses. It was way too much, and it only reminded me that something has always got to give in life. Taking just one of those courses in the summer before would've gotten me further ahead in the long run. I took 4 in the following semester just to manage the burnout. \n\nTo be fair, this is upper year engineering, so it could be manageable in other fields, I'm not sure. It really depends  on your learning style, and other things you have going in extracurricularly like clubs and jobs.",

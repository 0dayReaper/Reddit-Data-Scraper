After about an hour of trying to make it work the professor in charge had to volunteer to watch over some of the students via BBB. The worst part was that I had to use the washroom in the middle of the test. I did inform the professor about my reason for stepping out but if he considers it as cheating I will probably have my grades deducted. I barely managed to finish the 2 hour paper within 1 hour.",

    "postText": "I'm graduating high school in a month. My extroverted friends who are going to party schools and living in res all seem super excited about the amount of partying they're going to be doing through their university years. I'm coming to Carleton in the fall and not living in residence for first year. I'm pretty confident I'll be able to make at least casual friends, but I wasn't really able to get invites to parties in high school, and I know Carleton's not really a party school. Is it pretty easy to make friends/get invited to parties early in the year? Any tips on how I can \"put myself out there\" more?",

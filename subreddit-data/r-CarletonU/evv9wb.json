Plus, one of my chonker posters got removed in like the first five minutes from when it was put up on one of the billboards... I don't even know anymore. Posting policy isn't respected by anyone using the billboards, so I just decided to post them anyway. Plus, I'm taking the remaining ones down on Monday anyway so it's no big deal.",

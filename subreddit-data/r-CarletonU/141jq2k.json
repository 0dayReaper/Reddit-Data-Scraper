            "comment": "It's not bad, I enjoyed my time. Living close to class and having the cafeteria for meals was really nice. I certainly found that it eased the transition to university and living away from home, which can be a bit overwhelming. It started getting old by the end of the year but it was not the worst thing.\n\nSocially it's really nice. It's easy to get to know your roommate / floormates. It was nice to have a few friends right at the start of the year before I started making more in class and through clubs.\n\nIt is a bit expensive, around $1500 / month for a traditional double (including meal plan). My monthly expenses living alone in a studio in Centretown are less than that. Although I started renting a year ago and it's a completely different market now. I'm pretty simple with groceries and definitely don't get the volume/variety of food the caf is capable of providing. You could also pay much less living with roommates.",

I moved across Canada from BC for Carleton and lived on campus, it was super helpful for meeting people and making friends (even tho I was the Covid year 2020). And I may be the only person, but I loved the caf food \u2014 it\u2019s so hard making good food living on your own lol especially when busy",

I didn\u2019t do res for first year but did it on my final year and I\u2019d 100% say to go for it. Its nice having that group of friends living in the same floor/room as you, food not being a problem either. Especially if this is your first time being in the city as well bc most likely people in res would be their first time too! Goodluck:)",

I spent only half of my first year in res and had to leave because it was so shit. \n\nIf you\u2019re assigned to Glengarry House, leave because it\u2019s not worth it. I\u2019ve heard good things about some of the newer buildings though. Caf food is disgusting and in my personal experience made me sick. \n\nResidence is definitely an experience and it could work out great for you, but note that there are some amazing apartments around the Carleton area",

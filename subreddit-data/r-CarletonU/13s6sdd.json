Another thing to consider with co-op is that you can\u2019t finish your degree on a work term, so maybe the table is the way it is bc of that (just showing possibilities)? \n\nAlso, you don\u2019t have to follow that table exactly. My brother couldn\u2019t get a position for this summer (just finished second year) so he\u2019s taking classes, but he got one for the fall.",

    "postText": "Hi people!\n\nI just wanted to make a post here about the Carleton Music Club. We've only been running for this past year and have hosted jam sessions at studios as well as Carleton. We plan to do big things this year with CUSA funding, such as a student concert at Ollie's in September, free studio jam sessions throughout the summer (plus school year), jams at Carleton, awesome guest speakers and so much more! Please consider joining the Discord (https://discord.gg/JsvWCHAxrs) for more info on all of these events and a supportive community of fellow music-lovers where you can freely discuss all things music. Registration forms have not been published yet, but please do stay tuned!\n\nLooking forward to seeing everyone! \ud83e\udd18",

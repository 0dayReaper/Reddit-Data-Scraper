    "postText": "Hello everyone \n\nI'm a contract instructor here at Carleton, and I wanted to say a few things to you. \n\nYou are trying to learn in an unprecedented situation. It is hard. Nobody expected this, and nobody was really prepared for it. \n\nDo not be surprised if you find it hard going. It's not your personal failing, it's a bad situation. Do safeguard your physical and mental health as your top priority.\u00a0 Courses can be retaken, if necessary. \n\nUse the mental health resources in the pinned thread. \n\nTalk to someone. \n\nPost a rant here. Someone will be listening. \n\nTalk to your instructor, if you are struggling. Many of my colleagues will be supportive. \n\nI have 280 students currently,\u00a0 and I'm proud of all of them, as they cope with the situation. I'm proud of all of you. I see you. \n\ncheers \n\nAndrew",

I loved going to your class, watching your demos, having you explain Physics in a way that actually made sense, and being fair with your assignments as you wanted us all to succeed. I got an A in your class and before going into the class I was literally happy to get anything over a C as that was my perception towards Physics, but you changed me. NEVER in my life did I think I would do well in a Physics class, but you made it happen. I still do not understand how you don\u2019t have tenure yet as you are one of the BEST profs I have ever had and this post just shows how much you care for your students and how lucky the University is to have you.",

Here's hoping the side effects aren't ruinous.",

I am a graduate, but I just wish some of the older profs in the geography debt *cough*JohnMilton*cough* didn't have the opposite philosophy (that he thinks he should make nonsensical assignment where he gets you to write out a lot of implied info in order to \"challenge you\". Completely messed with my report writing skills that I had been working on for 2 years using CSAS services. Also never ever designed his teaching to help visual learners no matter how many times I asked). I know this post was to talk about covid, I am still just still mad about John Milton when things were normal. I cant imagine how his students are doing now. I also think he might be a sexist because he clearly picked favorites and heavily favored male students (from what I observed). Edit: checked rate my prof and people are saying he is especially not considerate during covid... surprise surprise. Paul Williams is fantastic, take his courses instead.",

It was the perfect storm of: \n\n* I already knew a lot of the early material, so I skimped on lectures and stuff. Now it's further in and I don't know all the stuff, but the prerequisite info is buried in the early lectures between all the stuff I already know, so I have a hard time looking for it.\n* The lectures are full length (Some of my classes have really managed to shorten lectures with the online format nicely, this one did not)\n* It's just one big cumulative assignment. I had no idea how much I'd hate this until I did it. But I couldn't get something working in time for checkin 2, around checkin 3 I was burnt out as hell from post-reading-week workload, and right now I'm just sort of stewing and awaiting my doom as I need to pull some kind of miracle to have something presentable for the final submission. I'm honestly just going to try and get as basic a submission in, aim for a 50%, and use my SAT on it.\n\nAs for my other classes, I'm managing alright. I think I'll be able to maintain a B in them at least.",

    "postText": "I've been looking through Carleton's public class schedule and I found that there is an ELEC 3909 section running this semester explicitly meant for Co-op students. Logically, it's also is scheduled 6-9, meaning after normal work hours. What doesn't make sense to me is that the mandatory PA section (which according to online class outlines also does midterms) is scheduled at 2:30.\n\nDoes anyone know anything about this? How can a section meant and scheduled for Co-op students have a mandatory PA session that will almost certainly conflict.",

I was just pointing out that the mandatory PA sessions seem to conflict with normal work hours (they are scheduled at 2:30). This is despite the fact the only lecture section available is explicitly meant for co-op students and is scheduled at 6 because of this. I was asking if anyone knows how this odd PA session scheduling works with the fact the class is meant for co-op students.",

My Mysuccess page says this, it doesn\u2019t include any summer study terms. \nSince it didn\u2019t mention the kind of term I assumed it was meant to be done during a work term, otherwise why mention co-op at all? (Since they\u2019re the least likely to be available in the summer at all)",

Space in these summer courses is usually restricted to co-op students for this reason, as ELEC 3909 in particular is a common repeat course, or reach-ahead course, so the space needs to be reserved for the first few weeks (usually) before it is opened up to non co-op students.",

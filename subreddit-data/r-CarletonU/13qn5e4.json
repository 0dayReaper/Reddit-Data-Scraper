    "postText": "When I was a highschool senior the sentiment was very much still, you need to go to university and get a degree otherwise you will be waiting tables or scrubbing toilets for the rest of your life. The adults in my life didn't really tell me which degrees were more or less likely to get a good job than others. I think they were stuck in the mindset of when they were in their 20's and most degrees could get you a good job. \n\nI chose a degree (law) that I wasn't really interested in but I did it because that's what was expected of me. In my last year of school I started researching job pathways and realized that my field was incredibly oversaturated and most positions were for administrative assistants. Law is unfortunately one of those fields like psychology, sociology, biology, and chemistry where you really can't do much with just a bachelor's. \n\nI've come to realize that I can't even become a paralegal because that requires a separate degree, I can't work in certain government jobs because that requires a masters, and I can't be a lawyer without going to law school (obviously). And my overarching discovery once I graduated was... I no longer have any interest in working in the legal field. \n\nI picked up a job at a hospital that was just supposed to be temporary until I found a law job. I get to work in each department of the hospital as a supply tech and see what different healthcare practitioners do. The funny thing is I spent the first 2 decades of my life having no idea what I wanted to do with my life. And the first day at this temporary hospital job I new I wanted to get into the healthcare field. I've decided I'm going back to school, most likely in a medical radiation technologist program so that I can become an X-ray tech. But I feel much better now and more motivated now that I have a clear goal and a plan on how to get there. \n\nI regret not making this discovery sooner but I'm glad I finally did, instead of pursuing a job that I have no interest in and working there for the rest of my life.",

I studied polysci - I\u2019m not a politician \ud83d\ude05 - I work at a non-profit doing policy analysis. I have colleagues with PhD\u2019s, Master\u2019s, Bachelor\u2019s, and college diplomas. None of us studied in the area we now work. I studied the core skills of policy analysis in my Master\u2019s - but not in the field I work. \n\nCast your net wide. It seems like you\u2019ve found your path, so this comment is mostly for others. Particularly in the social sciences and humanities, there are plenty of jobs that will value your experience and approach regardless of the subject you studied in particular.",

I currently don\u2019t have a background in policy analysis but I do currently work in party politics. Did you have a background in policy analysis or were you able to get that position just with your degree and learn as you go? Thank you!",

So yes, there was a link between my degree and profession), from which I transitioned into a policy advice role (mostly playing a challenge function against analysis). Afterwards, I did my Master\u2019s and am now on the analysis side of public policy. \n\nSo - I had some background. The biggest thing with working in policy ultimately is: do you have a general knowledge of how institutions, systems, and governments work? And do you understand how to determine what\u2019s relevant or not? If you have those two things knocked off, you\u2019re well suited to a generalist policy role from which you can specialize. I recommend Government itself or the non-profit sector as your two key sector targets for employment.",

I think someone with excellent people skills (soft skills) can destroy someone with pure technical (hard skills), generally BA grads are better at this.\n\nMy previous manager (now moved up in the organization) graduated with a BA. She has no tech background. But she knows how to play the game, find, talk and absorb the information she needs from the technical people.",

You'll find yourself competing against very few Waterloo grads here, if any.\n\nFYI: I think the math background, along with CS is a winning combination. There will be unique opportunities that combine the two.\n\nAssuming your good at both, you need not to worry.\n\nI recall there was a company in Peterborough that could never find a developer to work with 3D meshes. \n\nThat's something that whould combine CS + Math. Not many CS students like Discrete math.",

    "postText": "Hello Guys, I'm thrilled to have been accepted to Carleton University in Ottawa for my undergraduate degree in Aerospace Engineering. However, I'm facing a significant challenge: I didn't receive the prestigious university scholarship and I am expected to bear the full costs of tuition and fees, despite the limited entrance scholarship they offered me (at $3000 CAD).\n\nI'm reaching out to seek your advice: Do you know of any innovative solutions or alternate avenues for securing funding that might help me cover these expenses? Are there any governmental or organizational scholarships I should explore? I would deeply appreciate any insights that you might have, as I'm eager to pursue my education and career goals in this exciting field.",

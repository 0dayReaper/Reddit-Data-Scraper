I think it's circumstantial. Sometimes it's better to pick a minor that's directly related other times indirect benefits.",

            "comment": "A BIG warning. This minor is ***very very*** connected to math.\n\nComputer Science is the study of algorithms and their application in computing. Programming is practical implementation of algorithms. This is likely one of the most challenging and most rewarding minors that may help your career in unexpected ways because it will really improve your ability to solve problems using computers. However, expect this minor to increase your work burdern A LOT for the 2nd year courses.\n\nThat being said, the minor is something you can take and get by just fine with moderate math skills.\n\nAnother warning is the workload on this minor is significant. Depending on your background COMP 1005 and COMP1006 will likely be easy or very hard. If you have zero background in programming I'm told people find it difficult but very much doable. It's just a lot of work for those who have no background. If you do have some experience in programing you will likely find the courses fairly easy but COMP 1006 will have some new material for you to consider, especially data structures. COMP 1005 and COMP1006 are often taught as a cross list with the COMP 1405 and COMP1406 courses which the students in the BCS program take in their first year and when that occurs they cater the course to students in the BCS program.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Courses to Watch out for**\n\nThe second year courses are not easy and many students taking the minor wash out here. This is because the courses listed are also required in the BCS program and it's those courses that often cause the most drop outs from the program.\n\n**COMP 1006 (Worload: Light if you have programming xp, Moderate Otherwise)**\n\n*This is a gate course and getting less than a C- may limit your 2nd year couse choices.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COMP1805 (Workload: Light if your good at math/logic, Moderate otherwise)**\n\n*COMP 1805 Discrete Structures* is a computer science math course and it's central to computer science. This course introduces models and processes that will be used to view ANY problem domain in terms of mathematics and prove the efficiency and correctness of the algorithm. This course focus on introducing you to the tools used in that process. Some of those tools are very math intensive but in most cases it will be things you likey have never seen before and introduce new domains in math. *This is a gate course and getting less than a C- may limit your 2nd year couse choices.*\n\n**COMP2402 (Workload: Moderate to Heavy depending on how well you understood 1805 and 1006)**\n\n*COMP2402 Abstract Data Types and Algorithms* is a course it seems many fear and is one of the most common reasons for a person dropping the program. This course builds on COMP 1805 and is your first taste of algorithm analysis. It's almost exclusivly focused on the run-time performance of algorithms. This course bridges the study of algorithms with their implementation by having you analyze the algorithm and then implement it to test your theory's on efficiency. A common difference for this course vs other universities is the simplicity and brutality of the marking schema. It's normally taught with 4 or so assignments making up your entire grade in the course. Those assignments force you implement something you have been taught but the professor will break one part of the algorithm in a way that will affect the run-time performance of the algorithm. They make sure the thing they break will not have many solutions on the internet and the few sources they do have will be programmed into their anti cheat software if you use them. You submit your assignments at anytime after assignmet until the deadline to be auto marked as many times as you want and get the best overall mark for each. However, many of those assignments give you few marks for partial correctness so it's not uncommon to get either 100% or 0 no matter how hard you worked. Part of the brutality of the leasson is the power of big-o and what it means to be an upper bound. The testing software barrages your program with so many inputs that any minor tweak you made will be meanless and that only the correct solution will be in the expected range. A lot of people fail this course\n\n**COMP 2401 and COMP 2404 (Workload: Very Heavy)**\n\nThese courses are in C/C++ which is generally considered a difficult language to learn. It's a lot of fun if you love programming but pay attention to your programming bets practices from COMP 1006/COMP1406 because using them will make debugging managable.  Students that have poorly written programs will struggle to get assignments done on time because debugging will take forever. Beware of taking this with Christine (who might be the only prof teaching it) because while she is a great teacher, she is absolutly brutal in her marking takes no prisonors. You learn a lot under her, but expect to put a lot of work into these courses and be challenged if you want to do well. *COMP 2401 is a gate course and getting less than a C- will mean you cannot take COMP2404*",

    "postText": "I will be a first-year resident living in the dorms and one of the questions on the RIF is if I am interested in the quiet floors. I like keeping to myself and living in a quiet environment but I also came here to make new friends and friends with different personalities from me, so I'm concerned that the quiet floors will be boring and restrictive, at the same time, I'm worried a normal floor will be too loud.\n\nIf any of you could share your experience, that would be very appreciated. I've also read the post two years old about this topic but I wanted more input. Thanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

However, my friend got placed on a quiet floor in first year without requesting one and people were constantly getting written up for making minuscule amounts of noises even during frosh week. If making friends is important to you, I\u2019d advise going to a regular floor",

Some are so quiet it feels deserted while others are quite lively. Speaking from experience on both designated quiet floors and normal floors.",

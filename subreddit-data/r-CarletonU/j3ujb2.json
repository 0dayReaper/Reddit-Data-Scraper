The problem is that we have marking guidelines and can't submit a class with all A's...",

In at least some other faculties there are no target distributions or averages. Grades might get sent back for review if there are, for example, an abnormally high failure rate.",

Not every sample of students, i.e., a class, is going to fall into a normal distribution. For goodness' sake, you're all supposed to be scholars. Trying to fudge your numbers so the data looks good is shameful and it hurts students. Scholarships are gained and lost on fractions of a percent. Shame on the deans for pressuring you like this and shame on any teacher for folding and submitting to it.\n\nToo many people get A's? Maybe it was a good batch of students! Imagine that! When it starts happening more frequently than should be expected tell the dean to make the course harder in the future. Don't screw the current students. What the hell.\n\n\"Excuse me, professor, why did I lose marks here?\"\n\n\"Because of grade quotas. Sorry, you can't have an A, but I have plenty of space for B's so I'll give you one of those instead.\"",

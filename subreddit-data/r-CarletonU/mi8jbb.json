We are more likely to view the logo and typeset on a small screen now, so they need to be shrinkable and handle possible distortions.\n\nThe old font is pretty bad at it in particular - it has different spacing and uneven scaling both vertically and horizontally. Similarly, there's no point having a very detailed logo with writing and stuff on it if it's mostly going to be too small to make any of it out. Also, a modern logo should be adaptable. You're not going to always have it against a plain white background, so it needs to handle different background colours at the very least, which this one doesn't.",

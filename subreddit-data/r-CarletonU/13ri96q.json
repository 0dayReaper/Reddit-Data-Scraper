I got a total of $14,000 across four years, which was a nice discount on the program and near the upper end of what you can get from entrance scholarships, but it wasn't close to full tuition.",

The most I got was $9000 for first year and $4000 is renewable. I have 3 A*\u2019s but you don\u2019t need much to get a scholarship from Carleton as they\u2019re pretty generous.",

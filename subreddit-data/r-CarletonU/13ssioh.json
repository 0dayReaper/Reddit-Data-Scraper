    "postText": "Hi,  \nI'm heading in my second year. I was wondering if it's better to take 2402 in fall along with 2401 rather than 2804. I originally planned to take 2804 but it happens to be early in the morning which is sometimes a prob for me. I've seen some comments sayinig 2402 helps prepare for technical interviews for students in co-op, so I'm wondering what to take?  \n\n\nAlso, for 2401 would you prefer taking it with Christine (in-person) or Connor (online). I heard they are good profs but Christine's assignments,tests &amp; workload is very challenging. Most people like her but hate her assignments and markings. On the other side, I never took a course with Prof Connor but he's the only prof I found on 5/5 rating on ratemyprofs.   \nI mostly prefer in-person courses, but I'm seeking to know more about them to help me choose nicely this fall.\n\nAny comments will help",

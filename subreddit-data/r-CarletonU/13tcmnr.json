    "postText": "My sister is set to start at CU this fall for Bachelor of Commerce with a concentration in Information Systems, and I am trying to help her out with making her timetable, but it is very unclear.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m currently going into 4th year in Comp Systems Engineering, and there is a very nice and clear progression map for all engineering programs in which courses to take in each semester, and what connects to what (in terms of prerequisites). \n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be anything like this for BoC, and trying to figure out what my sister should take in each semester has been fairly confusing so far. \n\nI was wondering if anyone here is currently in the Information Systems stream that could maybe help me to help my sister by sharing their courses in each semester that you\u2019ve  taken so far? \n\nOr if anyone else has any clarification that could help us out, anything would be much appreciated!",

            "comment": "I graduated from BCOM IS. I strongly suggest she pursue a secondary specialization or minor on top of the Information Systems stream. Finance/Accounting or maybe computer science minor if they're still allowing those not sure. I didn't really like the program, it's a lot of 'business speak' and not a lot of substance. If she likes techy things and programming she may be disappointed.   \n  \nTo lay out my course progression I just made a spreadsheet based off of the following website: https://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/undergradprograms/business/#Concentration_in_Information_Systems  \n\nYou could also put her in touch with the Unofficial Sprott discord community which can be found here:  \nhttps://discord.gg/ywKVNPS3tT\n\nlmk if you have any other specific questions, I can try to dig out the spreadsheet on my old pc if you want.",

This [link](https://carleton.ca/registrar/registration/course-selection-guide/bcomm/#sect1) has a list of class to register in. For some classes, she would need to register in specific sections which are mentioned in the link.",

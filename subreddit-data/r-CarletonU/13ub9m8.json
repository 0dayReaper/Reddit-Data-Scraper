I understand that it\u2019s permissible to take seven courses per term if your GPA is sufficiently high enough, but does it still count if my grades were earned through a different institution? Thanks in advance for any insight.",

Achieved a minimum overall Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 7.0 (B-). If you meet these requirements you can automatically register on Carleton Central for an additional 0.5 credit in the Fall and Winter terms and either the early or late period of the summer term.",

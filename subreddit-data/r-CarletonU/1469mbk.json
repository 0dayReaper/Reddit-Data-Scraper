    "postText": "I\u2019m going into my fourth year and get to TA a summer course. I\u2019ve heard mixed things about the likelihood of being able to TA fall/winter courses because graduate students have priority so there are fewer spots for out of priority TAs. \n\nIf you\u2019ve TAd a psychology course in your undergrad in the fall or winter term, I guess if you\u2019re in a rush just please comment \u201cI have!\u201d So I can get a feel for how normal it is. If you\u2019re not busy, feel free to add any additional info you might have (: \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAlso?? I keep hearing mixed things about reaching out to professors beforehand to increase your likelihood of TAing for them. Some people have said it\u2019ll increase your chances of getting picked, others have said it\u2019s pointless bc the department does the assignments. Personally, I didn\u2019t reach out to any profs and got picked. Does anybody know how it actually works? Should I reach out beforehand in July/august to profs about TAing (for fall term)?",

            "comment": "Hey!! So I\u2019ve TAd as an undergrad in the fall and winter semesters. I didn\u2019t reach out and I was selected. That being said, profs requesting a student does for sure make a difference. After being selecting the first time I asked the prof to keep requesting me and I was pretty well always chosen. They typically fulfill the prof requests first and then slot in the rest of us (this goes for grad level as well). I\u2019ve had a situation as a graduate TA where my prof requested more students than he had TA positions, and only in that instance was a assigned to another prof and class.\n\nKeep in mind tho, most profs take their own grad students first!",

That is all super helpful (: I appreciate it\n\nI\u2019m trying to plan out my next year since I want to make money (job hunting has been going \ud83d\udc4e), but also am hoping to do a research project with a professor so I need to not be toooooo overwhelmed with work/classes/volunteering. So I\u2019m debating whether I should find a long-term part-time job or just cross my fingers and hope I get picked to TA again. Your insight makes me more optimistic for TAing. And maybe as they keep updating the list of who is teaching each course I\u2019ll see more familiar names and send an email about being interested in TAing for them (: \n\nThank you again for your help (:",

I\u2019ll be applying to do my undergrad thesis this year so I\u2019ve been trying to best prepare for that because I reeaaally want a certain professor. \n\nSo yeah, any info/your experiences I would really appreciate (: you also said after you first TAd you asked that prof to be requested again \u2014 asking those types of things horrifies me, so if you have any tips on reaching out like that or to other professors to TA, I would definitely rlly appreciate that. Also if you DM today and I don\u2019t reply, it\u2019s because I\u2019m feeling super nauseous and probably fell asleep aha",

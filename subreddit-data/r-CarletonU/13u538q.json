On the theoretical side, it may be more difficult. Ultimately, you're ready for your thesis when you can convince a supervisor that you're ready. And that may be the hardest challenge if you're not already in 4th year with suitable courses to backup your proposal. Space is limited in these courses as professors can only take so many students at a time in and so there will be a bias towards selecting graduating students.",

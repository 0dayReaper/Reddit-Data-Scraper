    "postText": "I'm doing computer systems engineering next fall and I want to do a math minor. However after the engineering math courses that are accepted for the minor, I don't have any electives spaces for any math course. After calling the admissions office, they said I can possibly ask the engineering department to see if I could shadow some courses or make an arrangement of some sort. Is there anyone has any experience with this combination? I also don't mind taking summer courses",

It's very possible to take the rest in summer / co-op terms but note that they won't count for anything in your engineering major.\n\nNo need to talk to the eng department either. Just apply for the minor on central after your first-year.",

            "comment": "I'm a civ,  did a geo minor, my friend did math. My advice, move fluids and stats and ODE to the summer and just right there u have room for 3 math course during the year, and then try to fit that 4th one in. then you would have calc, algebra, ode, calc 2, math methods + the 3 u made room for. Also if ur in the 16 month co-op u don't really have to move anything around because ur taking 4 extra semester u can be taking 1 course at a time to round it out. \n\nFor me in geo, I used my 2 electives + 2 carry overs and took 4 extras. All my semesters i had 6 courses, except spring 3d year and spring 4th year and I finished with a 10.0 overall. TBH tho depending on what ur minor is, it helps carry your eng skills. For me in GEO, I'm proficient in geomatics so it really helps with roads, hydraulics and planning. Math can help for struc in civil / in comp systems it can help.",

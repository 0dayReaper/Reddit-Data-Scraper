    "postText": "I'm a grade 12 student and I'm currently deciding between Carleton CS and Ontario Tech CS. Both of them are offering Co-op. I was wondering if you could provide me any insights that could help me decide? One thing I'm worried about is retention rates and finding the programs super difficult. Another thing I'm considering is how good the co-op pools are?  How likely is it for me to get decent positions throughout my degree that can help me find a good job  once I graduate? What  was your experience? Sorry for the spam! Just super confused making this decision. Thank you!",

Personally Oshawa feels like a suburb that want's to think it's a city, there's also some dumpy parts of Oshawa too.\n\nDon't forget when you graduate from OUIT chances are you'll be applying for jobs in the GTA which will have you competing against grads from Waterloo, UofT, McMasters, York, Ryerson, Brock, Trent and Ontario Tech + the colleges.\n\nAt Carleton, if you apply for jobs in the Ottawa area your most likely to encounter only uOttawa and Algonquin grads. Generally Carleton is the top choice out of those three schools in Ottawa.\n\nThere's an oversaturation of junior devs trying to break in, so whichever school and location has the least amount of competition to find full time employment is the way I'd go.",

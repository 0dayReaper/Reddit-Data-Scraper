Just wondering if anybody could give me any advice on the program. If it\u2019s hard, courseload/workload, etc. Very excited to join the campus this fall!",

Get them out of the way early so you can focus on your stream and decide if it\u2019s the stream you like. A lot of people change streams in 2nd or 3rd year, so best to decide early.",

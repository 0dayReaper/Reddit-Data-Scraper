    "postText": "[https://www.facebook.com/IroncrossCanada](https://www.facebook.com/IroncrossCanada)\n\nIroncross is a Canadian game inspired by gridiron football, but made simpler, faster, and freer-flowing. It is similar to lacrosse, except that the players carry the ball by hand and tackle opposing players to steal the ball. Goals are scored by throwing the ball past the goalie into the other team's net. It emphasizes basic human skills, including running, tackling, and throwing, in a way that no other sport currently in existence does. \n\nMessage my facebook page. Players also welcome.",

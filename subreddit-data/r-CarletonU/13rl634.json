The assignments have very detailed instructions\u2026I know someone complain about the instructions are too long but they\u2019re actually super helpful and make assignments easier since you know what you\u2019re expected. Tuts are designed for assignments and you get full marks for attendance. The exams are hand-written which I don\u2019t like but they\u2019re also reasonable. Christine also answers questions on forum frequently. For those    always find it hard to adapt to new prof like me could do these 2 with Christine and it will be a easy transition. Highly recommend:D",

I also put what I took them for in brackets\n\nGreat: Robert Collier (1405, 3007), Christine Laurendeau (2404), Jason Hinek (1406), Alina (1805)\n\nGood: Alina (2402), Connor Hillen (2401), Daryll Hill (2804)\n\nFine: Lou Nell (2406), Wilf Lalonde (1008)\n\nSome of these might be controversial but this is just my personal list.",

I prefer in-person courses but I feel like if I take it with her, it might be a nightmare with the workload",

Christine's lectures are more polished and precise but I am sure Connor will continue to improve his lectures as he teaches more. I prefer in person over on line lectures but that comes down to personal preference.",

    "postText": "The deadline to accept uni offers is in a few days, and I am leaning towards Carleton as my best offer. However, I'm not from the Ottawa area so I would have to live in residence during first year and then find somewhere to rent after that. I've heard that most Carleton students are from the area and commute, so it is quite difficult to find somewhere to rent. Some people say that there is no available housing near the university and the closest places take about an hour commute. Thoughts? Is this generally true?",

            "comment": "We have a student population around 100,000 people in this city. (OttawaU, Algonquin, Carleton, etc.) So there's a lot of turnover every May as people graduate and move on. I doubt half the students are from Ottawa... Everyone I know is from somewhere else in Ontario, Canada, or International. (This is why April-June is the best time for housing. If you wait until September, yeah there's nothing left.)\n\nCheck places like padmapper, places4students.com, roommatesottawa.com... etc. There are tons of rooms for rent. From $600-$900 for a decent place with 1-5 roommates is common. \n\nI recommend looking for somewhere somewhat central since the busses suck. Old South Ottawa and the Glebe look family-ish at first glance, but they're nice neighborhoods with a ton of student housing.",

            "comment": "Echoing some other sentiments here, the main limiting factor is how much you can afford. That said, if you're splitting the cost along several people you can usually find something for a decent price. I've had great luck finding places on Facebook marketplace, kijiji also has a few. And definitely look in the summer months, there's typically much more available at that time compared to the rest of the year. Good luck!",

            "comment": "In short, no. It will not be difficult to find something. Throughout my 3 years after moving out of res I never struggled to find something nearby. In long, yes it can be difficult because budget is a serious factor. Further away and more into the suburbs you will pay less for a room in a house shared with friends but you will have a significantly longer commute. Anything close to the school expect to pay 650-850 for a room. If budget is a concern when the time comes but you want to be close enough I\u2019d recommend looking at something along prince of wales or meadowlands as opposed to old Ottawa south which can get really expensive.",

    "postText": "Here\u2019s the backstory, I recently wrote a midterm for one of my classes and when I finished I forgot to close the software (and left my laptop open). Like what most guys do, after submitting my test I instantly went on P-hub to relieve some post exam stress. After finishing, I realized that COMAS was still taking screenshots the whole damn time\u2026 I even checked the logs afterwards and there\u2019s a bunch of pictures of me just absolutely spanking the monkey. I\u2019m scared cause my class is in person and I\u2019m not ready to face the prof in case he saw them. Anyways I don\u2019t think I can get in trouble for it but I just hope my prof doesn\u2019t get pissed or something cause that\u2019s what most people do after a midterm anyways, they are just lucky enough to remember to turn off their webcam.",

I assume some home boy out there will notice that you had PHub open through the logs, clearly after the exam was over, and promptly ignore it with no need for it to ever be known by anyone else.)",

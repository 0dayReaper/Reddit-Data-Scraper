The registers office will only transfer 50% of your credits from your first degree to put towards your second.\n2. You'll have to do a course override since the CS department tends to severely restrict who can register. Even then you'll be very limited on what courses you can take.\n\nFor sure you'll be able to take Comp 1405 and Comp 1406, if your lucky Comp 2406, Comp 3005 and a few other ones. But don't expect to take all the CS courses as a BA student.",

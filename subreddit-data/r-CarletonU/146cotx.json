    "postText": "Hi peoples\n\nI\u2019m looking to get contacts. Are there any locations in center town area that goes directly through Carleton insurance to sell contacts? \n\nAlso, can I use the insurance when the September semester hasn\u2019t started? I\u2019m not in summer classes. \n\nAn other question, when does the insurance reset? Can I get contacts now and if it resets in September get glasses then?\n\nThanks",

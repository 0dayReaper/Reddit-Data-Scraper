    "postText": "I am an incoming civil eng student and I am wondering if the only chem course I have to take (chem 1101, chemistry for eng. Students) is similar to grade 12 or not. I currently have like an 85 in 12U chem and it is probably one of my least favourite classes as it takes me a little bit to understand concepts, compared to other classes such as physics. So how much of a difference is there between grade 12U chem, and chem for eng students? Are they similar? Is it basically review? Or is it a new course that goes deeper into chemistry using 12U as a foundation?",

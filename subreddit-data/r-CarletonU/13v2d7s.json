    "postText": "I got the green light for the accelerated master's, so I can get 2 of the 5 credits out of the way in my final year of undergrad. \n\nI'm just a bit confused as to what the bottlenecks are for scheduling an MCS, seeing as it consists of 2.5 credits of courses (5) and 2.5 credits of thesis over 2 years by default.\n\nI'm unsure how the thesis credits can be spread out, in the undergrad thesis you just put 0.5 credits in each term, so that would be 5 terms in the master's if it works the same so I assume that's not the case.\n\nI'm not sure how this would work but if I were to also hypothetically work off of my undergrad thesis for my masters thesis, could I reduce the amount of time required for it and potentially have it done in one year after my undergrad?  \nThat would mean taking 1.5 credits of MCS courses and 2.5 credits of thesis in one year. \n\nIs this doable/possible?\n\nAny information on this is appreciated :)",

            "comment": "The courses will be a piece of cake. The thesis probably not so much unless it is a direct extension of what you're doing in undergrad. This isn't frequent but it isn't that unusual either. Are you going to be working with the same supervisor?\n\nThe expectations for a MSc thesis are quite a bit more than for a BSc thesis, so it is definitely aggressive to get it done in one year. There tends to be quite a bit more uncertainty in the outcome and the direction it takes to get there.\n\nIf you plan on attempting this, then I would certainly talk to your supervisor and see if they will give you credit for all of our thesis \"classes\" if you defend early. I.e., if they will let you defend as soon as you finish your thesis.",

    "postText": "So I miraculously found a really good co-op/student placement and they\u2019re asking for a co-op registration document. I\u2019ve never been in co-op and when I asked about it they told me that I\u2019m too far into my degree and had to be registered for co-op a year in advance. The position doesn\u2019t start until winter 2024 and I need to fill these documents within the next 7 business days. So am I screwed and losing this amazing job opportunity?\nAlso I didn\u2019t purposely apply for a co-op position, I applied on fswep and thought it was just a position for students.",

            "comment": "It may be impossible unless one of two things happen:\n1) you speak to the company and ask them to hire you outside of co-op\n2) you speak to the co-op office and try get them to register into co-op1000.\n\nThe second option is very unlikely to happen due to a lot of reasons listed here: https://carleton.ca/co-op/coop-1000/\n\nMainly, you need to register into coop1000 and complete it two semesters before your work begins. I.e. even if you get into it for the fall, you can only start working summer 2024.\n\nRead the link above and talk to the co-op office - literally email as many people as you can and see if they're willing to meet with you and make an exception\n\nEdit: don't just email everyone that was a bad thing to advise - I mean like email some advisors or visit the coop office in person and ask what you can do to make this opportunity happen for you",

But that would probably mean you would have to cut back on the courses you're taking until you're eligible to start a work term, and then you'd potentially have to do 16 months straight of placements.",

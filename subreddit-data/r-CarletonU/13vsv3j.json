    "postText": "The Carleton Archery Club was a beginner-friendly club for both new and experienced archers to have a space on Carleton's campus to learn and practice archery, and to make new friends while doing it. Unfortunately, things fell apart during the pandemic.\n\nAs one of the former club executives, I'm looking to reform the club for the 2023-24 school year, and am putting this out here to gauge interest. As it's currently just me, I\u2019m looking to gauge membership interest as well as interest for anyone interested in holding an executive position in the club.\n\nA few things:\n\n*No archery experience is required. I am, personally, an experienced archer and can provide basic instruction.\n\n*You are not required to own your own equipment. Club equipment is available to borrow.\n\n*Historically, the club was open to both the Carleton community (including both undergraduate and graduate students), as well as the wider community in Ottawa. I'd like to keep that model going forward.\n\nI can answer questions here, as well as via PM.",

As far as the Carleton Archery Club is concerned, we charged membership fees in the past. These fees were to cover the cost of our room bookings (we could only book via Carleton Athletics for space and liability reasons) and new/replacement club equipment, and were significantly cheaper than what you would pay for a membership at a local club here in Ottawa. I expect that we'll maintain a similar student-friendly pricing model.",

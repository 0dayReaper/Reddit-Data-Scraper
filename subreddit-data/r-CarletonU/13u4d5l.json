    "postText": "Are the courses for 1st-year aerospace eng short? like what's up with them only being 0.25 credits? Does that leave me time for the (I'm assuming standard length) mandatory electives? also, is this in anyways related to the early-late-full semester thing? I'm loaded with questions lol so thx in advance!",

            "comment": "The 0.25 means it\u2019s a half semester course (so a pair is equivalent to one full course, although you might have to do an exam for each 0.25 course). You\u2019ll notice that you have 4 0.25 courses each semester, you\u2019ll do 2 in the first half of the semester and then the other 2 in the second half. \n\nUsually the pairs complement each other, for example ECOR1041 and 1042 both deal with programming. \n\nWith that in mind, you\u2019re likely looking at something equivalent to 5 courses per semester in first year which should leave time for the elective.",

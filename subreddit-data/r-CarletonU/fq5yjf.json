The problem was that he didn't really give any feedback on what he was looking for, nor why students lost marks. That, combined with the prof outright stating that he had effectively designed assignments in order for students to fail, rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.  \n\n\nIt didn't help that the prof mixed in rants about not understanding gender fluidity, or about how the odds would be stacked against the entirety of Gen Z once they graduate, and a handful of other weird tangents and diatribes.  \n\n\nI think /u/Crepsley9 can back me up on this.",

And. Every. Single. Class. There was a pause about how fucked our generation is and that none of us will ever own homes or have jobs we want.\n\nI would be boosted to an amazing feeling on Mondays by my best prof and then dragged down for the weekend by this prof. I waited until the second last week of March before I dropped.

    "postText": "Hello, I'm looking for advice on how to approach the final sociology exam. My professor is George Pollard. And in the midterm, I didn't have a good result. \n\nAccording to the professor, we jumped from the questions to the answers without addressing the \"why.\" The course is divided into 10% midterm and 90% the final exam.\n\nI would like to know if someone took this course and had a good result, what technique they used, how difficult the final exam was, and what tools I can use to improve.",

            "comment": "had him for two separate classes.  He's notorious for not giving assignment criteria and a lack of lecture notes so don't feel too bad about falling short on an assignment or two in his classes. My advice is that he Loves participation!, if there's a participation grade/bonus he offers speak up in class as much as you can, ask questions or make little comments/opinions (I know his class environments are kind of scary but try still he appreciates it especially with a quiet class and will likely remember your efforts when grading)\n\nIn sociology the key is to write and explain yourself **a lot.** Answers should be as long as possible, make statements, provide facts and explain *how* social phenomena occur and *why (*basically explain what makes society/people in groups function the way they do*).* I haven't taken SOCi101 with him so I'm unsure of the specific topics you're covering but my trick in sociology is to always know of a few perspectives or theories and be able to explain them then relate them to whatever question you're being asked.\n\nEx. have a good idea of some socio/theories like; functionalism, feminist theory, symbolic interactions etc... explain them on a macro scale (basic definition &amp; how larger society reflects these perspectives) and throughout your answer slowly trickle down that explanation to a micro scale and relate the larger issue to the topic of the exam question. Before submitting check for answers to the what/why and how. The more you write the better.   \n\n\nPS: \\*\\*If Pollard's syllabus for this class notes specific terms/words to not use DONT USE THEM he's serious about terminology and will be harsher in grading if these words are used often\\*\\*",

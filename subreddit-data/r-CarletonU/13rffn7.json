I'll be starting grad studies in the fall so I'm wondering if I'm supposed to have access to this as a grad student or if this is just an error.",

I will say, you are able to book an entire classroom for yourself (which I'll be honest is what I did when I couldn't book library rooms, and it was pretty nice tbh since I wouldn't have as many people coming into the classroom, unless they were just looking for an empty classroom).\n\nIf you email scheduling@carleton.ca and tell them about your issue, they'll be able to fix it. But once you get this fixed, you will no longer have access to that previous classroom booking portal.",

Yes, I was trying to book a library room (which I couldn't). I have the option to book some study rooms (like those small rooms on 2nd/3rd floor Canal Building), but the confirmation form required more information (e.g., event title, number of participants, etc). Do you happen to know if one-time (not recurring) bookings get approved automatically, or are approvals done manually and thus may take several days to approve?\n\nI appreciate the advice- I'd rather be able to book something than nothing, especially when it's time to hold office hours!",

But there were times where I made the request in the middle of the night and it would get approved within 10 minutes. \n\nAs for the event title I personally just wrote study session, and would usually write 10 for number of participants (would invite the students from my floor as a residence fellow and other residence fellows from my team, but no one would ever show up lmao). But I've written 1 before, and they still got approved.",

I still haven\u2019t fixed mine, but one said they send an email (not sure who to, maybe to who the other commenter suggested) to get it fixed. It seems like it just recognizes you now as a staff rather than student, so you don\u2019t get student options (if you\u2019re an undergrad RA rn maybe that\u2019s why, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s any different)",

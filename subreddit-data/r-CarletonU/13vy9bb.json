    "postText": "Hello, I will be entering in my first year of Software Engineering and I am wondering whether I need to invest in a laptop with a dedicated GPU or not. Carleton's website does not state any requirements about GPUs for SE and the CS requirements only need one if it is for the game development stream. Thus, is it worth it / necessary to purchase an expensive GPU-equipped laptop or not?",

            "comment": "I would get one without a GPU, in general this likely means better battery life, which is probably more important. Unless, of course, you'd like to program at 1000fps.\n\nThe one spot where a dedicated GPU might be helpful is for NVIDIA CUDA, but that's really only relevant if you're doing AI, which you probably won't. In that case use a school computer or get a GPU later.",

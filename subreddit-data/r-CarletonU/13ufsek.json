            "comment": "I am assuming you are talking about Computer Systems Eng, not Software Eng which would be an easier transfer but also pretty pointless considering you end up getting the same jobs and there is no clear preference by employers.\n\nAssuming that you have high enough grades to switch programs this is my best guess at credit transfers. (I transferred from Civil Eng to CS after I learned I love coding and hate the taste of concrete).\n\nSome of your credits will transfer over but not all. Math 1104 will transfer automatically. I was able to count Math 1004 as a substitute for Math 1007 so hopefully it also works the other way around. \n\nNone of the Comp classes (1805, 1405, 1406) have a high likelihood of transferring over. One could easily argue that 1405 covers everything and goes well beyond Computation and Programming (Ecor 1041) which is only a 6-week course but I would be surprised if it would transfer. 1406 covers pretty much exactly the same material as SYSC 2004 but again I can't guarantee it would transfer.\n\n1st Year CS also has a lot of electives. You could use these strategically. Take an approved Basic Science elective and Complementary Studies elective which the lists can be found [here](https://carleton.ca/engineering-design/current-students/undergrad-academic-support/electives-for-beng-programs/). With departmental approval, you might be able to take CHEM 1101 and/or Physics 1004 as well. \n\nMy CHEM 1101, a Geoscience class, PHYS 1004, CHEM 1101, MATH 1104, MATH 1004, and even a few ECOR courses all transferred from Eng to CS. But the Eng faculty has less flexibility in its course schedule. Be prepared to get less transferred than I did.\n\nBasically, you can most likely get 2 credits (The 2 math classes and 2 electives). Best case scenario you can get 3.25 credits transferred but I certainly wouldn't hold my breath.\n\nIf you are dead set on doing Comp Eng might I suggest taking a gap year. Work a job, save up some money, and then reapply next year. If you are open to sticking with CS then give it an honest shot. It's a good program with great Profs and you might even decide to stay.",

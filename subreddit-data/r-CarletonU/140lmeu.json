His own opinion about a subject would be the correct answer. \nAlso, our TAs stopped holding tutorials after class because they had no idea what to teach and just made it a time for everyone to work on their final papers. My TA also told me to not even get one of the required textbooks because it was a huge conspiracy book about Anthony Fauci and vaccines or masks, I can\u2019t remember exactly.",

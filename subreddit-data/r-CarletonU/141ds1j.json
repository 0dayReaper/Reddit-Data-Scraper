    "postText": "I had to get one of my grades revised. This was submitted by my prof in April. I was told it was submitted but my grade on my audit/grade section is the same. I have no reason not to believe my prof submitted the revised grade. I emailed the chair of my department and it\u2019s been radio silence (fwiw they are slow to respond so I\u2019ll give it a few more days). If I don\u2019t get a response, do I go to the dean? do I just take the L?",

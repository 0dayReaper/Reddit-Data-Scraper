    "postText": "So I got a conditional offer for CS Honours AI and Machine Learning Stream.\nOn the website it states that I need a average of 80% in Advanced Functions and Calculus and Vectors with no individual grade below 70%. Does this mean that both my Advanced functions and Calculus and Vectors marks have to be above 80% and all other grades cannot be below 70% or does it mean that I have to get a final average of 80% with both Advanced functions and Calculus And Vectors without any of them being below 70%?",

    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m an out of province and will be attending masters here for this upcoming fall semester! Deciding if I should do first year on res or try to do off campus housing instead, would like to have some insight on which May be the better option.\n\nI don\u2019t know anyone in Ottawa and for off campus residence I will be trying to do virtual room tours/looking through Facebook groups.\n\nBut should I just do first year on residence and do second year off campus when I know the area better? (Off campus would be the cheaper option)",

            "comment": "The main advantage to being on campus as a graduate student is the ease with which you can get to your lab. Hop in the tunnels, go to your building, done. The other advantage to on campus is you can find some other graduate students with whom you get along and get shared accommodation for your second year.\n\nThe advantage to being off campus is the ability to focus more on your work. It's hard on campus as it tends to be a bit noisier, you're not quite the same as most people around you (as they will be mainly undergraduates). Graduate studies is sufficiently different that the shared experience isn't quite the same.\n\nPersonally, I would go off campus.",

You might still get in on a waitlist but you'd have to ask. If you're new to the city and are entering an intense grad program, it might be worth the extra money to save on commuting since the price difference isn't huge between res or half of a 2bd apartment + all utilities and Internet close to campus (RIP rental market). Off-campus definitely comes with more options and more freedom though. Lots of advantages to both sides!",

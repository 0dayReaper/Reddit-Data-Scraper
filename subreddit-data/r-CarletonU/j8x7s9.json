            "comment": "Petition Description:\n\n\"As the fall semester continues online, reports of the implementation of an invasive proctoring software are being sent out to students. \n\nThe software will be able to:\n\n- Capture images of student's faces and private homes, as well as take screenshots of the student's computer screen\n\n- Know the computer's IP addresses and addresses of web connections made while the application is running\n\n- Access all file system activity within the CoMaS folder and on the Desktop\n\n- Access the computer's MAC address\n\nAll of these things are an invasion of privacy. The implementation of this will cause students to:\n\n- Aquire webcams, hardware, and faster internet. Causing an issue for students with strained resources\n\n- Install closed source software they may not trust and that may not support their current operating system\n\n- Give up privacy with little power to refuse\n\n- Stay in constant view of the camera and restrict \"suspicious\" body movements, which can lead to anxiety and stress\n\nWe ask Carleton University to:\n\n- Stop the use of proctoring techniques that invade privacy and gather private information on student's files and browser history\n\n- Stop the use of video capture to monitor students' movement during an examination\n\nThe University has stated that they are doing what they can to ease the transition to online learning. Please, respect the basic privacy rights of students and stop the use of this software\"",

                    "comment": "Here's a letter I wrote last year about another software, honorlock.\n\n\nI am a 3rd year student enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT) program at Carleton.\u00a0 My classmates and I have some privacy concerns about software we are being expected to use officially as of 23h00 last night, the exam is April 14th. I would like to preface this by saying that historically Carleton has administratered all of our final examinations.\n\n\nMy professor is requiring his students to use an online\u00a0proctoring tool which records information about us students that I feel to be in violation of FIPPA and the University Policies. This software captures my screen and transmits my exam session information to 3rd party US Servers. This disclosure releases my examination marks as feed back is provided immediately. Further the use and collection of this information on behalf of the school is out of the controls of FIPPA since they are a US company, and claim in their privacy policy that information provided may be shared for direct marketing purposes with 3rd parties. The application does not guarantee privacy either \u201cWe cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet.\u201d\n\nhttps://honorlock.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Honorlock_App_Privacy_Policy_032020.pdf\n\nThey seem to require a drivers license or student ID as well which based on a cursory search seems to violate some of the outlines on forbidden information disclosure given by the University, such as:\n\n* Race, ethnicity, religion, age, sexual orientation, address, telephone number, fingerprints, blood type, educational, medical, psychiatric, criminal or employment history\n\n\n* Any identifying number (student or employee number, for example) or symbol assigned to the individual\n\n\u00a0\n\n* Grades, tests, essays or library circulation records\n\n\nTo summarize, I am concerned about my personal data traveling outside Canada, I am concerned that this software has not passed the Carleton Privacy and Security processes, and \u00a0we are being forced to use the software without informed consent about how my information is being shared and used, there exists no option to opt out to my confidential data being exposed and shared outside of Canada.\n\n\nEmail I received back from the Associate VP of teaching and learning.\n\n\nI gather some of your classmates have also raised similar concerns. That said, we\u2019ve spoken with Algonquin and all is in order with regards to respecting privacy and ensuring your info is not released.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAll is in order for your exam on the 14th.\n\n\u00a0\n\nD\n\nDavid J Hornsby, PhD (Cantab)\n\nAssociate Vice-President (Teaching and Learning)",

The rates are almost certainly higher this year than others.\n\nThis however, is a side-effect from trying to take the in person examination system, and transplant it to an online setting. I see this as an opportunity to move away from traditional rote memorization exams, and towards open book, problem solving based examination. Some professors seem to be able to adapt, and others not so much.\n\nEmploying this software only stops people from cheating who can only afford one device. Someone with access to two computers could set up a kvm switch, and appear to be using one device while using the second to look up answers. There're probably a bunch of other exploits that are possible, and people who really want to cheat will find a way.",

It will be used in conjunction with CULearn and any exam sites in the future though, if this is implemented.\n\nBehind the scenes the school\u2019s administration has been planning to implement a policy requiring students to download a program called CoMaS, which is basically a RAT (Remote Access Tool).  Read the petition and do your own research for sure, but basically the main issues with relation to privacy are that this software has full administrative permission on our computers, meaning it would have access to a LOT of things that are not at all necessary for writing an exam, and are frankly totally a breach of our rights to privacy on a scale that should well be fucking illegal (assuming it isn\u2019t, which it may be even).  \nA great alternative that the university could use instead of this CoMaS bullshit is just requiring students to turn on their webcams and join a zoom call during exam writing, if they want to see what we\u2019re doing as we write and discourage cheating (without the total violation to our privacy). \nRead through the stuff posted though, they explain some of the main issues (from a privacy standpoint) better than I can.",

And yes, our tests are actually done on paper (depends on the subject). We have unproctored tests but the difficulty on them is seemingly increased. This software wouldn't even be effective against a user with multiple devices if you're going to use the multi monitor setup. I trust a prof proctoring me much more than a software.",

Any of the ERTH 1000 level courses are pretty fascinating. ERTH 1009 just has labs, a midterm, a final. No essays, no required readings (iirc), and textbook was optional... I got an A without it, the slides are very thorough.",

Every year after becomes gradually less restrictive and gives you more chances to take electives. Personally, I liked saving my electives for semesters where I knew the courses for my major were going to be tough so the electives gave me a break.",

I hate those too, that's why I prefer taking language classes instead; 1010-1020 are an easy A and are offered in fall, winter and early summer semesters. So the \"when\" really depends on your other courses (when you feel like taking a \"lighter class\") and personal preference. I'm in biochem not chem,  but I'd say get them out of the way in 1st-2nd year or in the summer so you can focus on program-specific classes later because the workload for upper year chem classes is...something... Alternatively, if your fall/winter schedule allows it, consider taking one easy elective + 4 core classes to make it easier.\n\nI would also recommend discussing your course selection with an undergrad advisor, they know waaay more about this!\n\nI'm not sure if environmental science would qualify as \"approved electives outside of sci and eng\" (as a free elective-yes) though. You can run an audit to see.",

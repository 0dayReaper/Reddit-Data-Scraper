The support over the past few weeks has been humbling and I wish I could have been able to answer you guys and thank you all earlier but now I can and I just wanna say thank you for all the insane love and support. You all have no idea how much the posts here lifted our teams spirits throughout the campaign. We are so grateful to you all. \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\n\nWe cannot wait to get to work for all of you in May!

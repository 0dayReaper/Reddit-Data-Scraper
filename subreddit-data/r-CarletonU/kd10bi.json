I envy the fact that he could have easily turned into a mad scientist but he has the sanity not to.\n\nHe could have said \"I've had enought with dealing with the Carleton administration\" then commit himself to working alone in a shed and with the knowledge he has make a fully functional coil gun or railgun.",

    "postText": "hi all, im looking at my course plan and i think i want to do my thesis over the summer rather than cram and risk my grades. however, i saw another post and it seems like people were having more trouble finding a supervisor for the summer than for fall+winter. so my question is, is it harder to find a supervisor over the summer? if anyone has any experiences + insights they can share to ease my worries or just any advice, i'd really appreciate it!",

            "comment": "I have one peer who completed their thesis over the summer term but it seems to be a rare experience. She also got an informal head start on the project a few months into spring term. Beyond being more difficult to find a supervisor for the summer term, it\u2019s a BIG project to complete in 4 months. Many complete their thesis in 8 months and some end up taking the summer term as an extension, taking 12 months to complete. \n\nHave you completed your honours seminar and PSYC3000 yet? If you\u2019re starting 3rd year now, you might consider making this year a bit heavier to lighten your course load in 4th year. \n\nIf you have a few supervisors in mind, it never hurts to reach out and ask questions. The advisors in the psychology department are also fantastic :) \n\nGood luck!",

The seminar is a lot of work, but it will prepare you *very well* to write your thesis. \n\nI would definitely recommend reaching out to the advisors in the psych department; they\u2019re best equipped to help you consider all of your options. A lot of us take extra time to complete degrees too, if that helps. I sure as heck did and they still accepted me into their PhD program lol",

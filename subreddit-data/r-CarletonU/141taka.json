Can\u2019t remember if there\u2019s an option to submit a writing sample, but if so, submit one related to your area of interest.",

The program is very applied as opposed to academic, which is different from most grad programs. \n\nThe top things that matter: grades and econ, letters that speak to your ability to learn/problem-solve/lead, and work or leadership experience. You will be asked to submit a transcript, two letters, and a CV. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions :)",

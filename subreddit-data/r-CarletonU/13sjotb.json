    "postText": "hi! i just finished my first year of engineering and had a 9.8 gpa (before any SAT\u2019s). i want to SAT enough to get to a 10.0 so i can keep my scholarship but i\u2019m not sure what looks the best. \n\nif i put a SAT on lin alg (0.5 credit) my gpa would be a 10.22 but i had a C+, whereas just mechanics (0.25 credit) makes my cpa a 10.05 because i had a C as my final letter grade\u2026..or i could SAT both (my only marks in the C\u2019s) and have a 10.5 gpa. \n\ndoes it look worse to SAT a 0.5 credit versus a 0.25 credit, especially when it has a better letter grade (don\u2019t want employers to assume i did worse than a C in linear algebra). should i sat the least amount of classes as possible? which option looks the best for coop?? what will affect me long term? \n\ni am in dire need of help \ud83d\ude00 \n\nthanks!!!",

            "comment": "I mean imo, since you sound like you're in first year, just SAT mechanics. Here's my reasoning:\n\n- You only need 10.0 to maintain an entrance scholarship/be on the dean's\n- You still have 3~ years ahead of you to boost your CGPA with other classes\n- If you later decide to pursue grad school, this will hurt you less*.\n\nEdit: you could totally just sat both and put yourself at a higher starting point next year, just cause I doubt grad school will look at your first year marks too hard.\n\nBasically, using your SAT on mechanics will get you the minimum to hit all the good stuff that comes with a 10.0 while doing the least possible 'damage' to your transcript.\n\nAs a side note, I've never known co-op employers to care about SATs on a transcript. In my experience they just look at your CGPA, some don't even look at the transcript. After you graduate absolutely no employer will ask to look at your transcript. It really only seems to be about grad schools.\n\n*In some cases grad schools assume a SAT to be the lowest passing grade (or so I've heard), but others don't care about SATs at all. So this may not affect you.",

Do I need to request to take it first and get permission or can I just take it. Also what do you think of taking STAT 2507 and or COMP 2406 as a first year student  (if it's possible)",

As for requesting, when I tried to take it in the summer I was told I had to request permission so maybe email the math/stat department and ask if you need permission first.\n\nComp 2406 has prereq of comp 1406 I believe so you would need to take that first assuming you haven't already. In which case, you'd also need to take comp 1405 before 1406. If you haven't completed either of those you'll need to wait until next year or the summer to take it\n\nHope this helps",

Your main barrier in first year CS will be that most 2nd year courses have 1406 and 1805 as a prerequisite so you cannot take them until have them. You can take a prerequisite at the same time but I think you require special override permission and they may decline that in the first year since you lack a record to inform that decision.\n\nIn later years they use your academic performance to see if they think you can handle more difficult stuff like overload or concurrently taking a course with its prerequisites .\n\nSTAT 2507 will be fine if you took it\u2019s prerequisite courses in your first semester",

            "comment": "for 2801, it\u2019s about writing some code for controllers of robots in Java during limited time, normally due 30 mins after class time but maybe longer. You will be with 1 random teammate every class and sometimes you get unlucky to have someone irresponsive  and do all the lab by yourself :( \n~20 mins lectures at the beginning of the class and then your team will write the code with help of TAs and Prof. You will use webot to run the code and test if the robot behaves as expected. There will be a final project with 2 random teammates with less instructions and help. A difficult multiple choice exam but I believe Mark gives huuuuge curve so the final mark is good. \nSince they move the Lego part, it\u2019s more about understanding basic but interesting algorithms and writing code during short time which is challenging.",

            "comment": "2801 was pretty chill. Majority of your mark comes from in class labs. The prof explains a concept for at most half an hour, then you spend the rest of lecture working with a partner to do the lab assignment. No homework, no readings. There\u2019s a final group project that\u2019s pretty fun (although there\u2019s a partial group mark aspect to it so cross your fingers you get a decent team) and then a final exam which is multiple choice based on cumulative course content.",

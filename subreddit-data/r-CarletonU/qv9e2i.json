Carleton was never about online or in-person, it was about the chonky bois. Those groundhogs need our attention and here we are acting like stunads, not caring about our groundhogs.  I don't want to hear about the online/in person! I don't want to hear it.  Now that's it. That's all I've gotta say. Frankly, I'm depressed and ashamed.\n\nWe need to do something like this for the groundhogs.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNdts2P-djg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNdts2P-djg)\n\nWe need to start a petition right away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w1jwrcx63zz71.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9bd66eed29c1d3d12bfd60a3548339f2f4b2fa74",

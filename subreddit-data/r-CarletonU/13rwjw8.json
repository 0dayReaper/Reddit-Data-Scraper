            "comment": "I haven't finished my minor yet nor graduated so I can't really touch on how it could impact job opportunities. I can however give my experience of why I chose to do a minor with Eng and maybe help in that way. \n\nFirstly like you said, it's likely another year of schooling or more. There are many things that could affect that.Things like prerequisites, and required courses could change the length of your minor. I would make sure that you know exactly how much longer the minor will take you. For example I'm taking one of my math courses this summer so I can fit another math course into my fall schedule as that's the only time it's available. I tried doing a 6 course load with my 5 eng courses and the 1 minor for a semester. It did not go well. So keep that in mind as well.\n\nSecondly I'd recommend understanding what you want to get out of the minor. You've likely already done this but basically think about what you want to achieve, will it strengthen your knowledge in a field you're interested in, develop some skills for the future or look good on your resume. \n\nFinally, the business department likely has someone that you can email for all the nitty gritty business minor stuff. They can tell you what courses you might already have a credit for  ( ECOR 2050 could provide a business credit for example) as well as just general stuff. So I'd try to find out who that might be. Again for me I just went to the math office and grabbed one of the business cards that had to do with undergraduates.\n\nOther than that good luck making the decision.",

I just did it because it interested me.\n\nHaving been graduated a few years and helped out on the hiring side, my company barely even looks at education beyond confirming the applicant has a relevant degree. For reference, this is for mechanical engineering - your mileage may vary with other disciplines.\n\nIt probably also matters more for more advanced positions that require some more specialized knowledge, but those often require a graduate degree in my experience.",

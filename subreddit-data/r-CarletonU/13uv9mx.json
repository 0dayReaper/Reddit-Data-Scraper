    "postText": "I'm not in co-op and I am currently doing my first CS internship (Software Developer Intern). It's outside of co-op (since I got kicked out of co-op for not being able to maintain CGPA). \n\nI'm entering my third year this fall, most people I know in CS are in co-op and most have a work term this fall. I'm wondering if I should look for an internship still this fall despite not being in co-op and having a work term. I'm probably going to try and find a part-time internship and try do take at least 3 classes. Or should I just focus on my classes and degree instead of worrying about doing an internship during my fall and winter term and just do them in the summer. I just want to get the most experience as possible before graduating, wanna hear everyones thoughts and advice.",

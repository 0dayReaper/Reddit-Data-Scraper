The assignments I felt were really challenging but fair, and the midterm and exam I felt we were really under prepared for as he gave us last year's as practice. And last year's midterm and exams were online and a cake walk compared to the ones he gave us in person. But I also suck at multiple choice style exams so idk.",

Although, if you learn better online &amp; prefer (slightly) less grade intensive exams, I wouldn\u2019t miss this opportunity since Sack didn\u2019t teach it last term and idk if they alternate or what",

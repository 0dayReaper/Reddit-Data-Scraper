Then we broke off in to groups and roleplayed different scenarios to show how we'd handle them (they're also evaluating teamwork here). After that if you're successful there's a trial shift with one of the staff and they give a review of if you're a good fit. There's also a 1 on 1 follow-up interview after the trial shift.\n\nYou need first aid training, and you're expected to register for the WITS personal training program within 6 months of becoming a staff member",

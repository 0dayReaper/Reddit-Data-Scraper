Especially important to note how a) the solution, as it stands, is extremely unequitable b) other schools, including UOttawa, are providing students the option to be graded pass/fail or take their grades pre-exam as final and c) how much popular support these policies have.\n\nAnd sign the petition! http://chng.it/RwyTLmMzvP",

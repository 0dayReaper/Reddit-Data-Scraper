Woah king, looks like someone is trying to scam you. Be careful out there yeah?\n* You want a comparison between Carleton and a random university 9000 miles away? No problem king! Luckily for you, I wake up at 4 AM daily to monitor other uni subreddits. When I gather enough data, I can easily compare both universities and determine with a 99% accuracy that Carleton is better. Oh, unless it's not.\n* You're looking for an easy elective and want to spend 30 mins monthly studying for that class? No problem king, just take any art class (except PSCI, PAPM or LAWS). It's not like art majors do any real work yeah?\n* Are you concerned that you might not be accepted? That's okay, even kings have doubts. Luckily for you, there is an easy indicator for that. When you get a letter of acceptance, it means you've been accepted. If you don't, then it's the opposite.\n* How good is that professor? Ehh, they're okay - unless they're not.\n* How good is that class? Ehh, it's okay - unless it's not.\n* How is party life at Carleton? You're on Reddit, it's not like it will matter much to you anyways.\n* OSAP questions? Well, Ford will literally pay money for you to attend this glorious establishment - unless he wants that money back, in which case you'll be paying him.\n\nHope that covers everything! Feel free to PM me any questions so I can ignore them.",

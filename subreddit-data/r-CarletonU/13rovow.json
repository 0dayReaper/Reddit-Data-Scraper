    "postText": "Hello, I got into computer mathematics from OUAC 101 as an alternate offer for Comp Sci. I\u2019m wondering if enrolling into the program would be a good idea if I\u2019m looking for a job in Software Engineering or programmer in the future. Also, is it likely for me to transfer into CS later? Thanks!",

Some of you undergrads who are graduating or entering your final year may be considering grad school. Many undergrads I've met are unfamiliar with how grad school works, so I am offering to answer your questions.\n\nA little bit about me for context:\n\n* BSc in forensic science from Trent University\n   * Worked in a residence fellow role for 3 years\n   * Involved in student government throughout\n   * Completed an undergraduate thesis in plant disease physiology\n* MSc in bioinformatics from University of Guelph\n   * Was a TA for a 2nd year biostatistics course both years of my master's\n   * Research in microbial ecology\n* Started my PhD in biology at Carleton University in September 2021\n   * TA'd 3 different courses since I started at Carleton \n   * Will be teaching as a contract instructor in September\n   * Research in plant biochemistry\n* All degrees have been back to back",

The big thing the program did for me was give me an academic background in a variety of scientific disciplines (e.g., biology, chemistry, stats, CS, etc) in addition to the law/forensics background. This has allowed me to change subdisciplines more easily during grad school (i.e., from microbial ecology in a bioinformatics MSc program, to plant biochemistry in a biology PhD program).\n\nWhile my PhD research isn't in forensics now, I do still think my degree in forensics was worthwhile. I had gotten an offer from a different PhD program that would have had me doing forensics research, but I decided against it because I wanted to move back to Ottawa. However, forensics is something I can always circle back to in the future.",

I\u2019m not actually considering it since I\u2019m doing the coursework option but if I ever did change my mind and wanted to go back, could I?",

I was jumping for joy to take the course that I took in Athabasca because they were some of the most difficult COMP SCI courses at Carleton. At Athabasca, I just needed to pass the class for the degree (regardless of if I got a C or A+ - it would not count toward my GPA - I put bare min effort to get the barest min grade to pass it, that's it that's all ... LOL).\n\nAthabasca's education level is garbage - I genuinely mean that. I don't even know why Carleton even credits you for those courses from Athabasca. I literally had to read the book, do the assignments myself, study for the final myself, and do the exam at Carleton while being watched through a webcam. To make matters worst, they keep using the same assignments and exams - which are all online BTW (well at least for COMP SCI courses - can't say for other programs).  The teaching method for the 2 courses I took was almost non-existent. It was recorded video (not live lectures) - from who knows when - that you could watch but you were better off learning from youtube. Grading was similar to Carleton, they give you the grading scale on the syllabus. Their website layout is far inferior to Carleton's. When I took it, it was kind of like Brightspace but very garbage-looking one. Not sure if they upgraded it now.\n\nOne thing I did like about Athabasca is that they would give you 6 months to complete the course. You can ask for an extension till 1 year. That university is designed for busy people who already have jobs and a family to take care of so I liked that structure and it works for some people who can't attend uni full time or in person. More uni should be like that IMO.",

It\u2019s happened to a lot of my friends as well. As other people in the comments have mentioned Athabasca is an option but it\u2019s outrageously expensive for 1 course.",

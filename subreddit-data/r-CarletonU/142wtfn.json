    "postText": "ive read the reviews and seen a lot of bad reviews and some good reviews. i can see the prof is bad but. i am very interested in the course content and neuropsychology is what i\u2019d like to pursue in the future. i\u2019d like to also take the \u201c2nd part\u201d of the course, PSYC 3307. \n\nbut im also not willing to keel my major cgpa in the process. im minoring in neuroscience and taking the main 2nd year courses in the fall so im wondering if its rlly worth it for me to take it and risk hurting my cgpa.\n\nits not like i cant understand the content. ive read through some lecture notes and past exams for the course and it seems pretty doable with a lot of work, especially if the exams remain as take home exams. i did very well in first year neuro courses and i have credits for both first yr bio courses as well. (if that makes any difference)\n\nso my question is can anyone tell me what they thought about the course. be very honest with me lol. any success stories? and if so, how did u do it? is it worth it? any perspective is appreciated!",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve never taken the course but I\u2019ve TAd it 3 times and the second part 2 times. When marking the grades are very obviously bi-modal. Either students are getting close to 100% or are around a 65%. The exams involve some strategy - you need to earn 100 points for the midterm and 200 points for the final for 100%. Each question is worth 10 points, where 10 is a perfect written answer. So answer as many questions as you can at a fairly reasonable attempt and accruing the points becomes easier. Throughout the years I\u2019ve noticed some students focusing their energy on perfecting a smaller number of questions and that always results in less points from my experience. That\u2019s all I can really share on this topic, but I just wanted to highlight the wide range of students\u2019 grades who take both classes.",

He mainly went on long tangents about unrelated things. He wasn\u2019t very helpful and made you feel like you were stupid if you had any questions. \n\nI don\u2019t know if he still does the colouring book, but that was maybe the funest part of the class.",

The content is interesting and you can focus on the topics you know best for the exams. I found the amount of content a bit overwhelming, but I likely over-studied and getting 100% is easy enough if you just keep writing what you know.\n\nThis is more likely to have an impact on your free time during the term as opposed to your GPA. If you are interested in the topic, you will learn a lot!",

Because of my cheat sheet I got 100 on the midterm,  it seemed like either people did well on the midterm of failed badly.",

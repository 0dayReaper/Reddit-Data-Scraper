            "comment": "Congratulations on accepting your offer! I\u2019m going into my final year of Communications Engineering, and have some classes in common with Comp Sys. I\u2019ve had a pretty good experience at CU. Imo, the assignments, coursework and pace really depend on the course and prof. In general, the workload is quite heavy so try your best to stay on top of things.",

            "comment": " \n\nhonestly, as someone just finishing first year, the workload can be stressful at times.\n\nHowever, its not as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. I'm assuming you are coming right from high school, so ill leave you some advice to (hopefully) make the school part of your university experience just a tad bit easier. Keep in mind as I just finished first year, my methods arent perfect, and different things work out for different people.\n\n1. STUDY HABITS MATTER - this is the main reason why the fail rates are so high for engineering, at least our first year. not one concept is too hard to understand given you put in an adequate time into it.\n2. upper year students are amazing! - get in contact with some at the start of your year. they have tons of advice, and know the city pretty well if you are new to ottawa. I'm in comp sys as well, and I got video lectures, slides, notes and more for a lot of my courses simply just by asking them for it\n3. dont depend on your lectures - this one is a lot more of my opinion more than anything, and can be easily debated. ECOR 1041 was an absolute joke for anyone who has even a tiny bit of python knowledge, while for those who have never coded before, it was an absolute hellhole. i'd recommend learning python over the summer to make it easier for you. getting back to the point, a lot of profs arent the best, and lectures are jam packed with content, so if you do end up going to them, id recommend learning the lecture on your on before going to them, then using the lecture as an affirmation to what you learnt. I ended not going to many of my lectures over this year (\\~25%) as i found them to not help me as much as simply just learning on my own. i wouldn't recommend many people to do this, but this is what worked for me.\n\n  there are some other things like that I wish someone told me before starting uni, but getting to the point: overall, the faculty and students are extremely welcoming and resembles a community, converse to places like uottawa, uoft, and waterloo. some of our profs can make the courses a lot easier, where some simply make it more complicated for no genuine reason. make to make sure to stay ontop of things before they pile up otherwise it can very easily snowball into chaos.",

                            "comment": "well for ecor 1041/1042, i\u2019d recommend free code camp, they have a 6ish hour long python tutorial which really helps lay down a strong foundation for python in general. to practice the concepts, i\u2019d recommend leetcode as you really only can learn how to code through practice; it\u2019s like playing a guitar. you can watch and read all you want but can\u2019t claim to know how to do it until you actually practice. this should cover all of 1041 and a good portion of 1042.\n\necor 1043/1044 were on the easier side, the lecture slides are extremely well done, and tash (who will most likely be your prof for 1043) is one of the better 1st year profs for engineering. see if you can find the slides from an upper year.\n\necor 1045/1046 you can\u2019t do much than simply grind through the textbook questions. the more you do the better. there are a couple of youtube channels i preferred to the prof, vandenberg, but hes a pretty good lecturer so i wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much as long as you can do the text book questions\n\necor 1047/1048 learn how to use fusion 360 through youtube, not much else i can say about this. for 1048, i have the same advice as 1045/1046, except i cant say for certain who your prof might be.\n\nthis is what i have to say about the ecor courses, if you want specific links or have other questions feel free to pm me.",

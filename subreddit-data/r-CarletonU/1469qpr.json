    "postText": "## What's going on?\n\nA recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users.\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader. This also has implications for users who rely on these apps for accessibility reasons.\n\nEven if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this may be a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.\n\n## What's the plan?\n\nOn June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app.\n\n## Should /r/CarletonU participate?\n\nOther Canadian University Sub-Reddit's have opted to participate in this protest, such as /r/UBC and /r/UWaterloo. In my opinion, I believe we should be participating. Our mod team has had brief discussions around this and haven't come to an agreement on how we should approach this situation. I have personally reached out to mods of other University subs to gauge their thoughts on the issue, and we have decided that a poll to see our user's interest in participating.\n\nOur internal conversations had several arguments on both sides:\n\n* First off, /r/CarletonU doesn't use any third-party moderation bots. However, I myself use a 3rd party app in which I do a majority of my browsing and moderating from (can't speak for the rest of the team on this front).\n* This is reddit drama, that has nothing to do with CarletonU. While true, like it or not, we are part of the reddit ecosystem, and these changes to the site can greatly affect the ecosystem as a whole.\n* We are a small sub-reddit, it won't make a difference if we participate or not. Sure, one sub-reddit alone may not make a difference, but it is about the totality of the protest which will send a desired message. Furthermore, in terms of size we are a top 5% subscribed sub-reddit on this site.\n* If this is going to happen, now is an optimal time as it is during one of the quiet periods for our sub as activity is low during the summer. The counter-argument being that people may have important questions about grades or registration or acceptance, etc. However, keep in mind that there are official avenues within the University to seek this information and /r/CarletonU is a community run by students and former students.\n\nWith that being said, we have a few options for what will happen on June 12th.\n\n* /r/CarletonU goes private, with no posts or comments visible for at least 48 hours.\n* /r/CarletonU goes into restricted posting mode, meaning you can view existing posts or comments but cannot make new ones.\n* /r/CarletonU remains open.\n\nWe also have a \"See Results\" option for those who don't care **(you will not be able to chose another option after you chose to see results)**. I'll leave the poll open for 24 hours so I can plan accordingly before the June 12 start date. As this is a dynamic situation that can change at anytime and is determined by what happens with the protest we would be re-evaluating after the initial 48 hours.\n\nWe are also open to other suggestions on how we could approach this either during the 48 hour period or after.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1469qpr)",

Official Reddit app is unusable for people requiring those features.\n\nDuring an AMA yesterday the Reddit CEO said the company was in direct contact with the developers of two accessibility apps. However, the /r/blind subreddit provided a much longer list of apps which the community uses. Furthermore, that specific response by the CEO was copied and pasted as he accidentally left the \u201cA:\u201d before his comment. It was quickly edited out, however in my opinion that suggests he was not doing an AMA in good faith and had no intentions of actually hearing the concerns of the community.",

Honestly, given that sub's focus, I'll be taking a lot of cues from them about what to support.\n\n&gt; ...that specific response by the CEO was copied and pasted as he accidentally left the \u201cA:\u201d before his comment.\n\nYikes. Sounds like bad faith indeed. If they're not going to reverse this decision, I think at a minimum they must concretely show how they are filling the void that would be left by pricing-out the third-party aps. If they don't, they're going to really feel the pressure. I see that some bigger subs are committed to indefinite blackouts starting on June 12th.\n\nE. Wow, [that AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/) is an incredible shit show. The bad faith and mudslinging alone is awful. The specious non-answers to legitimate questions makes it worse.",

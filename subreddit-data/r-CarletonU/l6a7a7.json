Just that Carleton when they updated the logo, took their coat of arms and threw out a lot of the symbolism and character, then made it flat and minimalist. It's just an abstract derivative from the coat of arms which was the original school logo.",

They basically removed the motto and the phoenix on top, but the book-with-maple-leaf-on-shield thing seems to have persisted with some changes.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong - I think that the coat of arms is beautiful and it should be displayed in prominent spots, printed on merch etc. However, as you scale it down it gets less legible, so for documents, websites etc it's more logical to use the simpler logo. The current logo can also be printed in black-and-white, while the coat of arms has a huge palette of colours.",

I did a bit of research myself and concluded it was the logo, so I am glad you found this. You are quite right in Carleton requiring a logo that could be displayed easier (especially in B&amp;W); I suppose for myself I do wish Carleton went the [UofT route](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/04/Utoronto_coa.svg/1200px-Utoronto_coa.svg.png) when converting their old logo/coat of arms, just by making it flat but keeping the symbolism.

    "postText": "I had applied for the bachelor of commerce program after graduating from college. I have the average for it and the required courses from high school except for calculus. I was about to contact them tomorrow to let them know that I\u2019m currently enrolled in this calculus course to make up for that requirement but they had given their decisions today. For the bachelor of commerce program they had refused because I don\u2019t have the prerequisite which is calculus. Do you think there\u2019s a chance where they\u2019ll be able to take their decision back if I explain to them tomorrow that I\u2019m currently enrolled in a university level calculus course which I\u2019m almost done so I can cover the requirements to get into the program.",

            "comment": "Normally when you are missing a prerequisite you will get a conditional offer, which will have conditions and a date to meet those conditions. So it would depend on when your course is finishing but typically conditions have to be met by end of June. Anything is possible, but it would seem unlikely. It doesn't hurt to ask though. Good luck!",

We have history - why is Carleton trying to market itself like it's a bank for millennials? I get that they want to ditch the Last Chance U moniker, but that doesn't mean abandoning everything cool and historical.",

The coat of arms in particular only really works on a white background and most of its details are completely lost if you shrink it. Same thing with the old typeset, which uses two different fonts which have different scaling and spacing both horizontally and vertically.",

If they want better inclusivity they can make changes where it matters.",

It looks great when displayed on a large sign, or imprinted on a degree, or worn on some kind of clothing. However, if you try squeezing the coat of arms to a small resolution for online use, or print it in black-and-white, or try making a stamp with it, it'll look straight-up awful. That's why most universities seem to have a \"full\" coat of arms and a smaller, simpler logo that represents their \"brand\". I'm not saying that the logos presented today are the only option or the best option, but I think that people who want the coat of arms to appear everywhere didn't consider why the university might think this is a bad idea.",

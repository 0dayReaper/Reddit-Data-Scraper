Thanks to the pandemic I was able to double down, and work full time plus go to school. A blessing in disguise. \n\nIf you told me five years ago I'd be graduating with a 3.83 GPA, I'd have thought that to be impossible. But today I've\n\nAt the age of 30, I'm finally able to call myself a graduate. I've struggled through messy breakups, health emergencies, family drama- and mental health issues throughout. \n\nNever buy into the idea that you're \"too old\", or there isn't a chance to fix things. \n\nRemember, you can overcome anything!\n\nGood luck fellow Ravens.

You never gave up. \n\nTo all the new and existing students in university, don\u2019t give up. Just because you see other students finishing up in 4 years doesn\u2019t mean you must have to also. \n\nThings take time. We\u2019re all living our lives at a different pace. Keep trying, but don\u2019t ever give up. \n\nCongrats again man! Super inspiring!",

Away from my field and working in industry but never thought will go back to me field. With this pandemic I got the chance to take the qualifying exams and pass all boards within these 2 years and that too being away from studies for 22 years. People told me you are too old to go back and do this. I had made up my mind and wanted to prove that age is just a number and determination can fulfil your dream at any age. After passing my board now I am on to new journey to be licensed physician if things work out. \nSo happy to see your post\u2026",

    "postText": "I'm going into second year COMP and currently have COMP 2402, 2406, and 2408 planned for my first semester, and also PSYC 1001.\n\nThe big question a) what is the easiest and or most doable second year physics course (as a minor option) [https://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/undergradprograms/physics/#Minor\\_in\\_Physics](https://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/undergradprograms/physics/#Minor_in_Physics). Part b) should I keep suffering through a physics minor or should I rip off the band-aid before it crushes me and stop the minor?\n\nFirst year wasn't bad the COMP was easy but PHYS 1002 was not a fun course, may just have been the teaching style with Alain Bellerive I didn't enjoy.\n\nThanks for any advice!",

            "comment": "The easiest second year courses on that list (in my opinion) are 2604 (Modern) and 2401 (Thermal). \n\nModern at least when I took it was a very broad but shallow introduction into a few areas of physics, overall super interesting and fun. Downside is that there is a lab component which is quite a bit more work. Thermal is a bit less of an interesting topic, but if Dag is still teaching it then he\u2019s an awesome prof. Thermal isn\u2019t overly conceptually difficult, but some of the assignments in the past were pretty rough. \n\n2202 is also pretty easy, but I remember the labs being a bit more difficult that 2604. Electromagnetism is rough and probably the biggest weeder course in physics if I had to guess, a real step up in terms of difficulty from the other second year courses. Good luck!",

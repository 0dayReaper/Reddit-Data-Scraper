The degree was awarded today, does that mean the transcripts will say degree awarded / conferred? trying to figure out if I can just get the official transcripts ready to send off now.",

I did the same, I applied on carleton central to send my transcript the minute my degree is awarded. It\u2019s being sent to my graduate school on Monday.",

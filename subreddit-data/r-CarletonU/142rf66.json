What I meant is that most decent windows laptops are over 1k (you said yourself if you have money get a thinkpad instead). And with the quality, performance/battery life of intel and AMD based laptops compared to M1, it's the better deal getting a macbook air. \n\nModern thinkpads aren't even what they used to be, it's just a dell XPS with thinkpad aesthetics. I own an old thinkpad I use to mess around with lol and you can't beat the value of a macbook with student discounts.",

While it is true that you will have the option to simply work in a Linux environment at all times, the problem is that some courses requires you to use certain software which are not supported on macOS, and if that\u2019s the case, you\u2019d have to manually install windows on your mac. So in conclusion, unless you absolutely enjoy the macOS experience, it\u2019s simply not worth the hassle",

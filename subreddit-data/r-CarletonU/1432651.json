You can start as soon as you\u2019ve completed COOP1000.\n\nCOOP1000 becomes available to you after completion of 5.0 credits (all of first year) and you\u2019d normally take it in the fall of second-year.\n\nAnd yes, you could also delay your work terms if needed (for example, not being able to secure a position).",

    "postText": "I\u2019m going into the journalism program this year and I am questioning if I should do a combined honours (double major) since I know we have to pick a concentration, but I\u2019m not sure. \n\nIs doing a double major worth it, particularly for journalism (my additional major would be Political Science, likely)\n\nLet me know your thoughts/comments/experiences. Thanks ! :)",

            "comment": "Nearly every journalism student I met was doing a double major and Political Science definitely seemed like a popular choice.\n\nI would recommend adding a second major that relates to what you want to do in the future. What type of topic do you want to report on as a journalist? Adding Political Science as your second major will definitely help if you want to get into a journalism career relating to politics. One of my majors was Political Science and we talked a lot about human rights issues, political parties, and international conflicts. If that is what you find interesting, then I highly recommend adding Political Science as your second major.\n\nIf you are not sure what you want to do, then you could always use your electives to try courses from another major you find interesting. The first year of university is time for experimenting and decided where exactly you want to take your degree.\n\nIf you cannot decide between Political Science and another major, then remember that you can have a double major and still minor in something else.",

Also, am I able to add a double major after first year? I imagine you would be, but does it make it more challenging since you have to \u201ccatch up\u201d so it would just be better to decide beforehand?",

Once in there you should be able to change elements of your degree (such as adding a major, minor, or concentrations). \n\nI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re entering first year so just be aware that Carleton might not approve your request to add a second major till later on in the year (especially for a major like Political Science). They generally want to see some of your grades and if there\u2019s room for you to take that second major. But don\u2019t worry as I was in the same situation four years ago.\n\nI started undergrad as a History major and wanted to add Political Science as my second major. To ensure my request got approved, I aimed to achieve a high GPA. About two month into the Winter term I submitted my application and got approved. I also took the required first year Political Science in the Fall semester, which definitely helped.",

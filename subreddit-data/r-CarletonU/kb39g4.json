Arrest this man!\n\nSo the cops take some eyewitness reports and after hearing what happened they arrest the man and put him in a room for questioning.\n\nSo in the room the man begins to explain what happened.\n\n\u201cWell officer, I was driving downhill towards the intersection and when the light turned red I realized my brakes weren\u2019t working. There were people in the cross walk and the street behind them was empty. There was one man on the left side and ten people on the right in my lane. So of course I swerved out of the way to hit the one man instead. Wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nAnd the cop says \u201cyes that\u2019s a very difficult situation, I probably would have done the same. But why was everyone saying you are a mass murderer and the witnesses say you killed 11 people?!?!\u201d\n\n \u201cwell officer, the asshole ran back towards the other 10\u201d",

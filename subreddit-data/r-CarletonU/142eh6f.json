Do those with distinction or high distinction receive a medal and/or sash at convocation or is it merely just stated on the degree? Thank you.",

Senate Medals are for the top 3% of the graduating class in the degree and University Medals are for the top 1% of the graduating class in the faculty. The people in engineering I know who are getting University Medals next week each have CGPA's more than 11.8x (most are somewhere between 11.90 and 12.00, inclusive). I'm not sure what the range is like this year for the Senate Medals.",

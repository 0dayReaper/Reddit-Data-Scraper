    "postText": "I\u2019m looking to go to Carleton in the Fall of 2024. I already have college credits (that I took/am taking during high school). \n\nI\u2019m interested in the Honors Neuroscience BA program (looking to get my PhD after) and will have about 5 credits worth of classes that should most definitely transfer over (prerequisites and electives). Will only have like 2 non-neuro courses left to take in the program (2 bio courses, probably the Fundamentals of Genetics and Foundations of Biology II/Cellular Biochem)  \n\nBecause I\u2019ll have 1/4 of my degree done, how expensive do y\u2019all think the rest of my degree would be? I have great academics and come from a low-income household. Will I get scholarships? I know there\u2019s a lot of bursaries after year 1, but do you think I\u2019ll get financial aid for the first year? \n\nAnyone in a similar program willing to share how much their tuition is? \n\nIn USD my household income in under $50,000 for 4 people, if that matters. \n\nAnd if any international students from the States can share their experience with me (application + legal paperwork stuff like visas) that would be dope:)",

I\u2019ve shaved a good year off of my degree already, so $90k for my BA is nothing on the **$360,000** it is to go to a neuro uni over here, in my area (which has very good science schools). \n\nAnd even if I get enough student aid to cover HALF of that, that\u2019d be $180k which is still DOUBLE what I would pay at Carleton. And your guy\u2019s neuro labs + program are super nice + more updated than the schools around me:) Plus less of a chance at getting shot too LOL",

Make sure to have a copy of the syllabus and anything else that shows what was covered to maximize the chance of a transfer credit being awarded.",

Unless you're working full time... I'm not sure it's financially feasible for you.\n\nYou're not eligible for student loans from the provincial government and there's very little funding for international students.",

I won\u2019t be eligible for ALL of the ones I used to be eligible for (i.e., the pell grant), but it will be doable. \n\nI\u2019ve already been saving up my money for college and that exchange rate helps B) I\u2019ll be working full time this summer and part-time over the fall and winter semesters. \n\nWhat\u2019s funny is that at FULL price, $30k a year is still 1/3rd of the price that I would be paying to get a Neuroscience degree here, in my hometown ($90k per year). And even if I worked my ass off, I would still be looking at paying $45k a year. Might as well go to a safer country and not have as many bullshit classes that don\u2019t pertain to neuroscience (they have like 4 semesters of fluff before you even get into the neuro classes). \n\nPlus some people have already reached out and told me how it went for them! I think i\u2019ll be able to manage it:) Thanks for the link! Was just curious if I\u2019d be able to go through Carleton for any additional financial aid or not.",

    "postText": "Hello /r/CarletonU users.\n\nWe have decided to open up from our blackout protest in restricted mode. This cause is something we still feel passionate about and we believe our users feel this way as well- especially considering the result of our original [vote](https://old.reddit.com/r/CarletonU/comments/1469qpr/poll_should_rcarletonu_participate_in_the_black/).\n\nWith that being said, we originally chose to stay private for 48 hours. However, as the events have unfolded over the last two days, we have learned quite a few things. We have learned that the reddit community is strong, but we've also learned that Reddit [believes this will pass](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759559/reddit-internal-memo-api-pricing-changes-steve-huffman).\n\nIt is apparent that a two day protest would not be enough to make Reddit reconsider, so many subs [are choosing to stay dark indefinitely](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/148ks6u/indefinite_blackout_next_steps_polling_your/). However, I believe this is something we should decide as a community.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Poll Options**\n\nWe want to gauge the communities opinion on how we should move forward. So here are our options along with some thoughts to consider.\n\n* **Go dark indefinitely.** Going dark indefinitely would give us no reassurances as to when our community opens back up and would completely depend on Reddits response.\n* **Go dark for 7 days.** Going dark for 7 days would allow us to re-evaluate our options regularily as a community while still participating. Ideally we would post another poll each week until it is deemed we can permanently re-open.\n* **Remain in restricted mode.** We could still participate in the protest by remaining in restricted mode. This means that users will not be able to post or comment, but will be able to see old posts and comments. With this option, we would likely re-evaluate after 7 days.\n* **Do not participate in the protest any longer.** Looks like /r/geegees is no longer participating in the protest. Do we really want to be like them?\n* **See results.** Use this option if you don't care and just want to see what the votes look like. Note that you won't be able to place another vote after picking this option.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any thoughts, questions, or concerns, please reach out to our team through mod mail and we will be happy to answer. In the meantime, expect this poll to be up for 24 hours before we proceed with our next course of action. Feel free to join the Carleton Discord [Carleton Discord](https://discord.gg/CarletonU) in the meantime as well.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/148v1k4)",

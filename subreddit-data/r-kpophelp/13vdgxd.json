I'm going to share my trauma but I want to hear other stories to make myself feel better \ud83d\ude2d\n\nmy top three worst things that happened to my kpop things:\n\n3. I received a damaged itzy album (was fine bc I got it replaced but it scares me)\n2.My Xdinary Heroes Gunil photocard came stapled INTO THE BOOK???\n\nand to top it all off (this happened today)\n1. I decided to try out the CD player in my beat up Chevy that belonged to my great grandma and it ate my \"ready to be\" CD and started making humming and clicking sounds and I pressed eject and it didn't come out ... so \"ready to be\" has been sacrificed to the car gods.",

It looked like a truck ran over it,  backed up over it, then ran over it again, and then it was tackled by a football player for good measure lol. The CD was smashed into several pieces, the photobook was bent and ripped in places, and the photocards and other inclusions were all bent. And I didn't get refunded from it since it was sent with media mail and not \"insured\", so...it was an upsetting experience.",

My DOTS OST album pack and 2PM No.5 were covered in chocolate milk. The outer cardboard for the OST albums had to be thrown out. Everything else was wiped down. The No. 5 album (my fave of all time), still has marks on it (aside from the front cover always being flimsy and the door plastic part is falling off). But nothing smells like milk or got mouldy so I'm happy.",

Well, long story short, one of the cards slipped off and went under my leg. Sat on it for like an hour before I even realized, and by then it was bent like crazy. It had to be one of my favorite Seventeen ones too. Cried for hours over that, embarrassingly enough.\n\nAnother time, was working on a trade and had all my supplies and stuff ready. I leave it for just one minute to run to the bathroom, and when I came back my sisters cat had, for some reason, grabbed the photocard and was dragging it around the room. That cat has never even BEEN in my room before, and the door was shut so I don't even know how it got in there. Having to explain that to the person I was trading with was so awful, I felt like crying the entire time.\n\nAnother time, I was reorganizing stuff again because I got a new haul &amp; had trade arrivals. Kazuha postcard from Antifragile, sitting on the table as I got ready to put it in. For whatever reason, my sister was pissed off at me so as revenge, she grabbed it and tore it to pieces. I was super upset, but I couldn't blame her too much since she's got some mental issues but trust me, I cried. It took me so long to find it from a trade so for it to get ruined in two seconds just fucked me up. \n\nBack when I still collected TXT, I traded for a Beomgyu card. They sent me a video and it looked perfect, no damages or anything! Well, two weeks later when it showed up, it was absolutely ruined. The card was very flimsy, like it would only be if water had been spilt on it. There were tons of scratches/dents, and it was bent at the corner. The packing was fine so I knew it hadn't happened in the mail. When I asked them about it, they blocked me lmao. Never did find another one, and I think that's kinda when I decided to stop collecting txt.\n\nI ordered a bunch of albums from this one shop that I bought from before. I never had any issues with them either! They always packed it up safely and did it fairly quickly! Well, this time, the albums came looking like it had been hit by the Hulk a few times. It confused me because the outside box was completely fine, it was just the albums &amp; the bubble wrap. Never did figure out what happened to it, but I stopped ordering from them lmao\n\nI've got so many more but I'll stop there. Unfortunately that sort of stuff is just an unavoidable part of collecting. Damage will always happen eventually, it just sucks when it does \ud83e\udd72",

            "comment": "Oh God, do I have several.\n\nOne time, I was reorganizing my binder. I decided to do this on my bed to make it more comfortable. Well, long story short, one of the cards slipped off and went under my leg. Sat on it for like an hour before I even realized, and by then it was bent like crazy. It had to be one of my favorite Seventeen ones too. Cried for hours over that, embarrassingly enough.\n\nAnother time, was working on a trade and had all my supplies and stuff ready. I leave it for just one minute to run to the bathroom, and when I came back my sisters cat had, for some reason, grabbed the photocard and was dragging it around the room. That cat has never even BEEN in my room before, and the door was shut so I don't even know how it got in there. Having to explain that to the person I was trading with was so awful, I felt like crying the entire time.\n\nAnother time, I was reorganizing stuff again because I got a new haul &amp; had trade arrivals. Kazuha postcard from Antifragile, sitting on the table as I got ready to put it in. For whatever reason, my sister was pissed off at me so as revenge, she grabbed it and tore it to pieces. I was super upset, but I couldn't blame her too much since she's got some mental issues but trust me, I cried. It took me so long to find it from a trade so for it to get ruined in two seconds just fucked me up. \n\nBack when I still collected TXT, I traded for a Beomgyu card. They sent me a video and it looked perfect, no damages or anything! Well, two weeks later when it showed up, it was absolutely ruined. The card was very flimsy, like it would only be if water had been spilt on it. There were tons of scratches/dents, and it was bent at the corner. The packing was fine so I knew it hadn't happened in the mail. When I asked them about it, they blocked me lmao. Never did find another one, and I think that's kinda when I decided to stop collecting txt.\n\nI ordered a bunch of albums from this one shop that I bought from before. I never had any issues with them either! They always packed it up safely and did it fairly quickly! Well, this time, the albums came looking like it had been hit by the Hulk a few times. It confused me because the outside box was completely fine, it was just the albums &amp; the bubble wrap. Never did figure out what happened to it, but I stopped ordering from them lmao\n\nI've got so many more but I'll stop there. Unfortunately that sort of stuff is just an unavoidable part of collecting. Damage will always happen eventually, it just sucks when it does.",

            "comment": "I had the SKZ I am You album and one day it fell off my shelf and the spine just... ripped. I have no idea how this even happened but it definitely hurt seeing the album like that \ud83d\ude2d \nI did sell it for cheap recently tho bc i am not collecting skz anymore.. \n\nI also once placed a 130\u20ac order on ktown4u. package arrived in my country, went through customs. Tracking said \"out for delivery\" and then the package just got sent back to Korea after one week. I called up DHL what happened and they just told me \"Your package never was out for delivery. We don't have more information.\" I was MAD mad... Had to fight to receive my money back because it took like 4-5 months for the package to arrive with ktown4u again and I surely wasn't gonna wait that long for a refund. \nI never bought the ordered albums again in the end.",

            "comment": "I'm not sure which of these is worse but:\n\nI bought an ateez dvd second hand and it arrived broken. All the corners of the outbox had completely split and the contents were spilling out. What happened? The seller sent it IN A SINGLE LAYER OF USED BUBBLE WRAP. I could not believe it. As a seller I still cannot believe it lol.\n\nThe pc that came with my lightstick was jammed and bent between the thing that holds the lightstick in place and the box itself. So the entire card was bent in half, at an angle. This was a few months ago. I have had it in a toploader under books since and it's still slightly bent \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI bought a pretty rare pc and the seller put it in the toploader RAW. It was covered in scratches :(",

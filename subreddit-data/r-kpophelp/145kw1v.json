I never had interest in them when I was younger. knew a few songs but wasn't my style but their variety show stuff got me and the fact Time to Twice was created by the team for fans to enjoy made me so endeared to them. The girls are so funny. So I reccommend that if you hadn't watched. Now I am a once and gonna see them in concert. lol.",

I love it, I'm like you where my main form of falling for these groups is the content online lol. I think the way I ended up wanting to watch everything is seeing funny clips on TikTok then theres like 121 TTT vids so far lol.\n\nDepends on what content you like to watch though, they have games, escape room type stuff, calming time off vids where theyre filmed like Sims enjoying their break time lol, Karaoke fun, Cooking battle, A lot of good stuff to watch. I'd say TTT is what you'd want but depending on what you like theres diff stuff to watch - I love them so I watch it all doe lmao\n\nActually a good place to start is the funny edits people make on YT",

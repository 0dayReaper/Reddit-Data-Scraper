I listened to this song the other day and I can\u2019t stop listening to it!  \n\nI know they are a S. Korea band, but since I read that some of their other songs were written more along the lines of K-pop I just wanted to know if this song was more technically J-pop\n\nI have no knowledge of these genres at all and I really want to find more like this one.",

KZ in particular has a fairly large discography of Korean idol group music.",

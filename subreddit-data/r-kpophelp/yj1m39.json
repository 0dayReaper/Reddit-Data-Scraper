I mean when I see the videos all 4 girls look pretty and same level of attractiveness but IRL Jisoo actually stands out. \n\n- Saw Big Bang in a hotel lobby about 10 years ago (was dining there with my family). Ngl they are really short dudes. I was shocked and my family just LOL\u2019ed cos I was taller than\u2026all of them\n\n- Saw 2NE1 in real life as well. CL\u2019s eyeliner had so much wing it almost took off \ud83e\udd85 She\u2019s very friendly though. And will attempt to communicate with fans. This was about 10 years ago as well.",

I don't have send off as part of VIP because I didn't want to pay an extra like 900$ for that.  If you are anywhere near the stage(s)/catwalk, the ticket is pretty much assured to be VIP soundcheck at least.  The ones that had sendoff perk attached to them, they are on the side of the catwalk or against the main stage, which I don't really try to get since sometimes you will face the back of them.  The tickets I got are front row of the extended stage and were only $500 at face value.\n\nIn my opinion, the best seats with the best view is the ones in front of the extended stage because that's where all the casual fan interaction happens.",

They make sure to look at every single Monbebe, which seems impossible but no they really wanna see their fans &amp; make you feel SEEN. So seeing them up close as they came over to the gates to wave at us, was very shocking. Of course they looked beautiful, handsome, sexy as on stage but it was just their energy as they waved at us that was most shocking. They are so WARM, welcoming and make you feel like you've known them forever. All the stage makeup was gone and just their natural tan skin tones....even more beautiful. Yet at the same time they were so humble.  Jooheon was so kind, and his smile was adorable. Minhyuk is easily one of the prettiest idols to ever exist. Hyungwon was so model-esque ,  cool and for some reason he was really into my knee high converse LOL \nI.M was very sexy LOL NGL like he was very sexy. His attitude and demeanor. Shownu....I was just like whoa. LOL he was so fineeee in person and so attentive &amp; sweet.  At the time Wonho was still in the group and he literally made my heart skip, he was SO SWEET AND CUTE. Trying to wave and see as many fans as possible, making cute faces at everyone \ud83d\udc94\nAnd Kihyun was confident and playful with Monbebe. They are so chill and cool. Very shocking.\n\nRecently I saw NCT127 live and that was shocking. \nWhile I didn't see them up close just being at the concert was incredible. Being able to hear Taeil's vocals live gave me chills. Straight CHILLS. Easily one of the best vocals in the industry. The power and soul in his voice. To add he's insanely UWU. It jst radiates off him when he speaks..legit natural cuteness. . Everyone in the group was kinda how I expected them to be in terms of how they look, they are beautiful of course but Taeil, Taeyong and Johnny Suh really made me awed. Very gorgeous humans.",

She always has a big smile but her smile that day was twice as big. So wholesome\n\nChaeryeong surprised me with just how small she is. When I walked up to her I felt like a giant. Gave her the biggest heart I could and she loved it and gave me a huge one back. She seemed shy during kcon but their recent tour she seemed way more into it and comfortable and she was tossing out love all around. The intro ments we about made her cry during the Phoenix show. The chaery chants were absolute bonkers and even she was surprised. Love her\n\nA picture I took of Sumin when people called her name out\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/zdgJlVw",

So it was shocking that it was large but not shocking because everybody always says it's large? Idk even though I was kind of expecting it I guess it was just different seeing it irl. \n\nI'm sure this is just because it was casual wear, but RV Yeri does NOT look like an idol at all, she just... looks like a really pretty and stylish woman. I'm not sure how to explain, she just gave way more mature vibes than her age (23). I honestly would've missed her in the cafe if I wasn't sitting at the right angle where she was in my line of sight. \n\nIU is insanely small. I could probably yeet her across the room if I really needed to for some reason. \n\nPsy is also much smaller than you would think. Could probably yeet him too (but not as far as IU) \n\nAnd lastly, with the exception of Psy (sorry bro) all of them were stupidly attractive. IU and V especially were insanely attractive, like stop what you're doing and just stare at them attractive.",

Also like I said they\u2019re all, for the most part, extremely small. Not just in the sense of height but their body\u2019s are just so tiny. It kind of shocked me honestly. They all generally seem very friendly and excited to see everybody as well when it comes to the high touches and meet and greets. My friend and I have both worn some goofy shirts with the idols we like on them and gotten compliments from the idols themselves when they saw them, so that\u2019s always fun too!\n\nOutside of that I\u2019d say the other shocking thing was seeing Tzuyu face to face. Like actually eye to eye lol she\u2019s one of the idols who is VERY tall! It says she\u2019s 5\u20198 in her profile but I\u2019m 5\u201910 and she was at least as tall as me lol",

Soobin came down my row at the concert, he was so close he brushed into my arm on his way through, and his skin is literally FLAWLESS. I\u2019ve never seen such clear skin in my life. His hands are huge. He\u2019s also very skinny, they actually all look a lot slimmer in real life. Someone else mentioned that they\u2019re not as tall as the official heights, but I disagree. I\u2019m 177cm, so I\u2019m as tall as the \u201cshortest\u201d member Taehyun, and all their heights seem legit to me. Soobin definitely towered over me. It was actually weird seeing Taehyun irl because he seems so small, but it\u2019s only because we\u2019re the same height.",

Hyunsuk was incredibly shy (maybe moreso than Yonghee when it came to fan engagement), BX liked to interact with the crowd, and Jinyoung came off as pretty shut-off, which was interesting to experience. \n\nThe Golden Child members (and this isn't a drag, I promise!!) aside from Daeyeol and Tag who weren't there, and Bomin as an exception, felt incredibly \"normal\" like their vibes didn't scream \"Look at me, I'm an idol\". It felt like they were just some dudes you could walk past and not think about alskjdjd. Bomin's features are really strong and tbh look better photographed. He's terribly skinny.",

I knew they were good looking but to me some members looked even better without makeup. Minghao and Jun were absolutely stunning in person. I was also surprised Woozi was so small, I know he is the shortest member but we were the same height. \ud83e\udd23\nI ran into a few idols while living abroad in South Korea. I ran into Daehwi (former Wanna One and currently in AB6iX) while out with friends. My friends and I didn't really follow Wanna One but one of my friends mentioned that he looked like Daehwi. We weren't 100% sure it was him since we didn't follow the group. Later in the day we found out it was actually him, because some fans posted about it on social media. \nI saw Siwon from Super Junior near my university I was attending. He was filming something in the area, there were tons of staff and people with cameras. I was running late to the train station so I didn't spend too much time trying to watch what was going on. \nWinner did a fansign by my university, it was an open event on the street so anyone could see. I was surprised how handsome they were! They also seemed very polite to fans and staff.\nI've also seen VeriVery before after a performance. I wasn't attending the performance but I was in the area. They're all so handsome and some members were very tall.\nI met current Omega X members Jehyun and Xen during fansigns while they were in their previous group 1team. They're so cute and funny! Please check out Omega X if you all have time!",

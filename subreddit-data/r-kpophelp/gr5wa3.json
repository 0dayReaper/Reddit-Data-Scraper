Many of the users on these subreddits also use Twitter. \n\nEDIT: Updates:\n\nThey are now spreading on all platforms. There are a few instagram profiles as well.\n\n\nFOR INFO AND BLOCKLIST ON TWITTER AND IG:\nhttps://twitter.com/fancamsituation?s=20\n\nhttps://instagram.com/fancamsituation?igshid=1g8bvfkp1rb0g\n\n*All safe links which do not show the gore*\n\n1. Look at this profile for information and accounts.\nI promise you, there is no gore there but there are screenshots of what the FC looks like so incase you stumble upon it you can immediately scroll away.\n\n2. there are several ACCs doing this and they are part of some cult that basically promotes  s--f h--m, su--ide, body sha--ng, eating dis--ders etc. \n\n3. PLEASE switch off autoplay on twitter\n\n4. Block! Block! Block! \n\n5. Spread awareness on kpop social media accounts\n\n6. I recommend not engaging with these accounts , like commenting on their posts or DM-ing them \n\nPlease stay safe and know how to prevent this from happening to you.",

It is different nowadays. But I have no one to practice my actual speaking skills (other than random voice chat in online games lol). I was always envious of native English speaking people, you are able to communicate everywhere without feeling insecure or embarrassed.\n\nIt frustrate me when stans blindly downvote anything different from their opinion. Reddit doesn't work like this... this is about discussion and enrichment of various opinions and experience of other people. \n\nI'm probably too old for this. \n\nI went on twitter to report those accounts mentioned above and when I saw the actual content of the clips, I lost all hope in humanity. It scares me that this kind of people are in kpop community.",

Most likely tho that this aren't kids but more likely just random dudes and girls who likes gore because they're sadistic and masochists but randomly takes request from someone who wants to trigger others, which means that the people that dm the fancams are not likely the kpop haters but the people who randomly requests from them. Also I saw someone asking her if she's part of the shinrikyo cult and she said \"im not a part of any of it and stated it many times\" so most likely they're trolls or a small group online but the interesting part as well is that they don't just do it to kpop, they do it to anyone because some also requested for other purposes like \"this dudes bullied my friend so can you send fc to them\" so it really depends whether they want to do it or not but usually they accept all random trigger requests although I did see some of them declining some requests",

It doesn't change anything, and even so if people suffer of suicidal thoughts, then there are bigger issues than a fucking word man.

Every little detail was caught!! \n[Vanner covering Love Killa by Monsta X (sooooo sexy!)](https://youtu.be/tc2pXfKguvo),\n[Vanner covering Adore U by Seventeen](https://youtu.be/tqr7jnNo4Lk)\n\nThese guys came in second place and were so beautiful!\n[Sevenus covering Hello by NU\u2019EST](https://youtu.be/XbfMt4RJCjs)\n\nA really sexy version of La Song by Bae173 - it really got my attention \ud83d\ude02\n[Bae173 covering Rain\u2019s La Song](https://youtu.be/DcXOedHsM-U)\n\nThis was an amazing cover of a girl group\u2019s song - they made it so tough lol.\n[DKB Covering Bang! By After School](https://youtu.be/Btt_Uvzr74I)\nTheir first cover was soooooo much fun and also just as athletic and energetic.  These guys are just fun lol.\n[DKB covering Ateez The Real](https://youtu.be/XfNSVOluXOw)\n\nAnd Bitsaeon from Mont has one of the most beautiful voices ever!  \n[Bitsaeon solo covering Jonghyu - End of a day](https://youtu.be/W4jatIT1Vmg),\n[MONT covering Fever by J.Y. Park](https://youtu.be/inGf6910h0w)\n\nNTX covered B.A.P. No Mercy and Moon Jongup was a contestant on the show!!!  It\u2019s a really hip hop version, and Jongup said when he heard them covering it in their own style, he really thought the next generation of K-pop had arrived \ud83d\ude02\n[NTX covering No Mercy by BAP](https://youtu.be/Eu6-5XOyTbc)\n\nAnd of course no Peak Time mention would be complete without Bad!  Just don\u2019t play this one in front of your significant other or on the screen at work \ud83d\ude02.  It\u2019s \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25.  Amazing performance, especially with highlights of Moon Jongup, Hangyul from Bae173, and Gon from Vanner.\n[Team C combined Unit dancing to Bad by Christopher](https://youtu.be/cl4cl_esnjU)",

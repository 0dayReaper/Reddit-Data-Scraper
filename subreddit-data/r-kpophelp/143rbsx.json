    "postText": "I recently fell in love with the instrumental to Shut Down by BLACKPINK. I love the combination of classical instrumental mixed with a heavy beat. I feel like ATEEZ had some similar sounding songs, but I\u2019m not sure which ones. Any suggestions would be amazing, thank you!\n\nHere\u2019s a link:\n\n[BLACKPINK - Shut Down](https://youtu.be/POe9SOEKotk)",

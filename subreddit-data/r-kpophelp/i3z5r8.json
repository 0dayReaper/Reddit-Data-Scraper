    "postText": "Hey :) I just wanted to talk about this cus I think about it quite often. I feel like people who like kpop who aren\u2019t Asian get treated like they are koreaboos by the general population. Even though I\u2019m Asian (Middle Eastern I\u2019m partially white tho) I still feel judged because I\u2019m the stereotype. Does anyone feel the same? Feel free to comment and please be nice to those in the discussion\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the responses it helps to know you guys have felt with the same issues. What I learned was don\u2019t give a crap about what people think. So I will try to work on that. And what\u2019s even more amazing is there is older kpop fans even though I\u2019m 15 it\u2019s nice to see people from all ages who like the same genre. Anyway feel free to continue commenting :)",

And it\u2019s unfortunate that anyone feels that way.\n\nWhy does enjoying entertainment made by people that don\u2019t look like you a problem for some people? I guess it\u2019s the \u201cannoying fan girl\u201d stereotype that people associate us with.",

Think about it this way... for a lot of ignorant people around you, they\u2019ll make some snarky remarks like \u201cyou can\u2019t even understand what they\u2019re saying..it doesn\u2019t make sense\u201d\n\nYou can tell them the WORLD has enjoyed American pop music and media for decades, without understanding a bit of it. I remember seeing people all over the world sing along to Michael Jackson without knowing English. Same goes for countless of other artists. Movies as well, meet any foreigner chances are they\u2019ll have seen a lot of pop culture classics from America. In English. Many move to America because of it and not knowing how to speak a lick of English. \n\nThis is the exact same type of thing. At the end of the day you don\u2019t need to understand shit, as long as your vibing today the sounds and the visuals that\u2019s all the matters, since music at the end of the day is just sounds lol\n\nIt\u2019s the same as other people judging you for dating someone while only knowing the shallow facts like looks and appearance. They don\u2019t understand how happy they make you, and they don\u2019t have to understand.",

Like thinking about how other countries and people all over  the world who have absolutely NO understanding of the whole English language, has actually been truly enjoying media from America for decades on end in movies AND ecspecially music, without understanding ANY English at all just like you said!!! And you\u2019re right that they don\u2019t like to let language get in the way of satisfaction of enjoyment, like that is so true and was something totally obvious but not something we actually realize until it\u2019s actually pointed out and said back to us does it actually \u201cclick\u201d inside of our own heads hahaha. But yeah I remember seeing how all of these American music artists would go on WORLD TOURS and see all these fans who don\u2019t even speak English at all lol but you can see them lip syncing tot he performance and just not letting anh barriers such as language get in the way of any true happiness that it actually brings to them  \n\nLike damn, Forreal, you haven\u2019t incredible point and have already made me feel A LOT better than how I was feeling prior to even reading your comment. This helps with my confidence tremendously (publically of course lol) as well as privately, now I think it\u2019s actually dumb to feel ashamed or guilty for enjoying what I enjoy. Thank you so much bro",

Before it got internationally popular, it was weird for being foreign. Weird for the guys wearing makeup, etc. I remember telling one of my friends about my interest in it and she like called my bias ugly LOL so I stopped saying anything about it. Later, one of my best friends was half-Korean, and I decided I tried to be open about it with her since she was familiar with it and I thought we could bond over it, and she especially would judge me for it, like I was a koreaboo or I wanted to be Korean. She would always make passive aggressive comments about hating koreaboos too that were obviously directed towards me. I stopped talking about it with her too. \n\nThe only time I truly felt comfortable telling people I liked kpop was in 2016. Basically, right before and shortly after BTS\u2019s Blood Sweat and Tears. At that time, there were a few other kpop fans at my school, and it was seen as something kind of niche and cool. The second DNA blew up though, I feel like kpop started to become just as embarrassing as before- this time for being \u201coverrated\u201d or like a cringy/stereotype. It feels like 1D when 1D was really popular/on the decline, like you were weird for being obsessed with 1D, or maybe the type of anime fans that are super obnoxious and argue with you about dub vs. sub.\n\nSo here I am, 9 years later and I still keep it to myself unless you\u2019re a close friend. I\u2019ve always wanted to put a kpop photocard in my phone case but I\u2019m just still too embarrassed. Been made fun of too many times, don\u2019t think anything\u2019s changed. I can\u2019t win either way- when it was unknown I was lame for liking it, when it got too popular I was lame for liking it. \n\nMaybe I shouldn\u2019t care what people think but I do so... Yeah",

Also, I guess people tend to think mostly Koreans like Kpop, Americans like pop, people from China like Cpop, etc., because the music is based on that country. \n\nTo be honest though, even at first I thought that all Kpop fans were Asian and girls, but ONLY because that's what it seemed like at my school.

The number of pretentious white British and American dudes I've met who think they're god's gift because they \"discovered\" French cinema, smdh. Liking K-pop is no different to liking any other form of media/entertainment in another language. I don't want to tell you to just not give a fuck because it's taken me decades to get here, and your feelings are very valid. It's shit that people judge you for something that they likely know nothing about and base their judgement entirely on stereotypes.

Also my partner is a trained jazz musician and it took me quite a few months to even bring it up that I might on occasion listen to kpop and even then it was something that I rarely ever brought up. \n\nWhat I've learned though is that while people have the right to their opinion, if I tell a person that yes I listen to a lot of kpop and their response is prejudiced judgement, that's not energy that I'm going to insert into my my life and move on leaving that person in their on regard. \n\nI understand though that as I'm older now and social pressures are not as tough for me that it's much easier to not give a shit about people's judgement.",

I'm almost embarrassed to talk about kpop though. It's a race thing and an age thing. I'm a married adult, so I also feel like I'm \"too old\" to be into kpop. \n\nI don't want to be Asian and I'm not obsessed with the idea of Asian culture.  I took an Asian Cultures class all through middle school that got me really into Japanese language, food, and history particularly out of all the countries that we learned about in the course. I didn't even like anime at that point. I got into Girl's Generation and they were like the only kpop group I listened to then I started branching out from there. I feel like I need to explain all of that and justify listening to music that I think sounds good, so I just listen to kpop when I'm alone and never talk about it. Oddly, I don't feel embarrassment when talking about kdramas.",

I was never ashamed of it, i let my friends know about it and didnt try to hide it. Unfortunately because it was 'different' they tore me apart haha. They said i had 'mental problems' and 'wasnt right in the head' and called me all sorts of things. They also bought me cheap merch and used it as another way to tease me. Luckily im not friends with them anymore, and my other group of friends are 100% accepting of kpop! (they find it funny at times but dont take it out on me)\n\nMy parents were also very judgemental, i get the feeling they thought i only liked it because the boys were attractive (little did they know they were raising a gay af girl haha). My dad believes that if the singers dont write the music themselves and dont play instruments then it isnt proper music, so i guess on the surface kpop didnt really fit that (even though i tried a million times to tell him about groups that did!). Also just the whole language barrier was a big issue for them. \n\nI totally understand its difficult to like something thats not the 'norm'. I wish more people could be less judgemental of kpop and at least give it a chance. Kpop is becoming a bit more mainstream now, its come a long way quite quickly since i got into it! I guess at the end of the day no one else has any business judging you for what you like, try to not let them get to you &lt;3",

I have been listening since I was 5 years old and now I am 16 and over the years I have heard some ridiculous stuff just because I listen to kpop. When I was a kid people would judge me for liking the idols and always say that the male idols look like girls that I shouldn't like them. I felt like I had to hide myself as a child and fake my interests. At the time, nobody had heard of kpop and if I was to express my interest in kpop, I would be made fun of or they would make fun of the idols and that made me feel bad. Then over the years the term koreaboo came into people's vocabulary without knowing the true meaning. When I was younger, I didn't know people didn't know what the true meaning of being a koreaboo meant. So when they would call me that, I would feel so shameful of myself and that I was crazy for listening to kpop. Now sasaengs and toxic kpop stans are what a lot of non kpop fans see of us and think that's what we all are. I have heard so many people call all the kpop community toxic and disgusting from these people and that just isn't true. I think that now, I am more proud to be a kpop fan and the community is so much bigger and stronger now. Just remember that you know you aren't what those people say and if people judge you for your interest in music, they are haters and don't deserve your attention or tears.",

One of the most common questions I'd get asked is \"why do you listen to k-pop if you don't understand what they're saying?\". My response was always \"well I don't understand American music either\". I mean I hear the lyrics but they make absolutely no sense. And 99% of the time, they'll say \"yeah that's true\".

All I'll say is that they bring bad or immature optics to the genre. Casual listeners from my experience and observation don't get judge. Casual fans are more likely to only discuss about kpop if its brought up by someone else or are subtle in their fashion/decor when it comes to kpop.

            "comment": "At my school, making fun of people for what they like is not really tolerated, so I guess that helps me. I still get made fun of by my friends in a kind of joking way, but all my friends are really close so they wouldn\u2019t stop talking to me over something like music taste. To be honest, if it\u2019s someone who could judge a person that harshly over just their music, I don\u2019t want to be around them anyway. Also, my friends have come to realize through me that a ton of the stupid stereotypes are not true for a ton of fans. I think I also do a lot of self regulation to make sure I don\u2019t get weird about it. It helps that I\u2019m really close with my sister and we both like kpop too, because even if my friends all hate me I\u2019ll always have her lol. Also, my mom always tries to support our interest but has genuinely become a huge NCT 127 fan haha. So all that to say I\u2019m really lucky that I don\u2019t have to deal with getting judged a lot, other than online, which is really easy to ignore.",

            "comment": "I made a post here once about a specific incident that was top for a while, although now there are posts with 4 times as many upvotes \ud83d\ude05\n\n Usually when asked my music taste I just say I dont listen to much so just pop, and if pressed I'll list a few  western artists that I listen to occasionally, and I feel a nervous jolt when I do get asked.\n\nOne time we had a history sub and I'd finished all my work so I'd gotten out my phone to play superstar bts (rip). As soon as my friends saw they started tearing into me, saying things like \"they all look the same\" and \"are they boys or girls?\" And insulting me for liking something so \"dumb\". The weird part is that they were both Chinese and one was a guy so you'd think they'd be the ones to avoid using Asian stereotypes as insults...\n\nOne time I actually did admit to liking kpop while talking with a girl I wasn't quite friends with but got along well with. She was super sweet and mild as a person and she had some more alternative interests of her own (gothy style, into forensics/true crime, etc) so I figured she at least might be more accepting of my own. But nope, she made a disgusted face and said \"ew you like kpop? I thought you were better\" and kept going on. I made a few meek defenses for myself but they did nothing so i just went quiet.\n\nI'll try and summarize \"the incident\" since I've already talked about it, but for context there were a few times where my best friend and I would alternate playing songs while doing homework. I was kinda self-conscious but he said that although it wasn't his favorite he also didn't mind my music either, so I thought it was okay. One day my family was at his playing a board game and I think I offhandedly mentioned kpop and that was the trigger for his mom to start tearing me apart. She essentially said \"yeah I've listened to a few kpop songs. Kpop is just really really bad\" and I don't think I need to explain why this is a bad thing to say, especially when it's an adult mom saying it to a known sensitive teenager. What's in my opinion worse is that my best friend also started going at me, and when I pointed out he said he didn't mind the music I'd played he said he was lying. Whether he was lying then that he didn't mind or lying now because of social pressure, he'd clearly lied to me and it fucking hurt. The mom, him, and his little brother kept making digs while the dad and my parents just laughed. My parents later noted how immature the mom was for initiating that, but they sure as fuck didn't do anything in the moment. I ended up leaving the room and crying in the bathroom for a couple minutes and came back red-eyed, although no one said anything.\n\nThere are a whole variety of reasons why some might treat kpop as lower. For one thing, everyone else does so people hop on the bandwagon to feel included and feel better than others, even if it means othering certain people. There's certainly a lot of racism as well, whether conscious or not. Whether it's because the boys look feminine or people can't handle the idea of music in another language, there are some pretty shitty racist ideas that people apply to kpop. There's also the factor that things that bring joy to teen girls are routinely devalued, dismissed, and treated as only for said demographic. People use \"teenage girl\" or \"something teenage girls like\" as insults these days and it's tragic. I mean just look at vsco girls, people really started to mock a whole personality type just for existing. I think the most prominent reason though is the fanbase interactions. Since most of us are too self-conscious to even talk about kpop normally, most people only interact with the noisy, toxic fans. Some are just people that can't stop talking about kpop or obsess over it even when nowhere in the conversation does it make sense to bring it up, others are actively rude to either other fans or to locals, both of which bring people's image of the fandom down. It doesn't help that most of people's experience comes from Twitter which has now taken the title of \"the internet cesspit\" from tumblr, which also happens to be filled with a lot of fancams commented under unrelated posts. A lot of kpop fans don't themselves associate with stan Twitter so it's tiring when people base their entire perception of us off of it.\n\nTL;DR: several people who didn't seem like a judgemental type ended up shitting on me and kpop, which happens for a variety of reasons.",

            "comment": "I just casually say I listen to a lot of types of music and then I subtly say \"But at the moment I really am vibing with KPOP.\" WHICH to my surprise people find it interesting that an 18M Latino enjoys KPOP. LOL \n\nBut full honestly, I never try to be in people's faces about Korea and their culture either because I know not everyone will like it so I never mention it unless people ask me about it. Especially now that I am in college people are so much more understanding about my preferences whereas in High school my friend and I would watch Kdramas in class in the back of the class so people wouldn't bother us because I was criticized for liking Gay guys dancing and singing. So.....another thing is that I have been interested in Korean culture since I was 3 years old. So for me, I have always been interested in Korean language and culture so for me Kpop and Kdramas were just an ADDED BONUS and for me (as a History major) I am so in love with history and geography of Korea like it is so AMAZING to study. So for me being told i am a KoreaBoo it hurts my pride cause I know that there is much more to Korean than KPOP and Kdramas. \n\nHope this was a good read but if someone calls you a Koreaboo remember that they are obsessed with something too but they can't admit it so they are attacking you because they are ashamed ahahah",

The first time I remember seeing/hearing anything related to K-Pop was when Chester Bennington died. People were posting their fan cams on popular twitter posts about his death. I remember that really messed up my views on K-Pop for a while. Then I played a Dreamcatcher song on pump it up and fell in love with the music.  I just think people's first impressions are really important and the popular majority of K-Pop fans are a little insensitive.",

(I still can't believe time passed just like that)  \n\nOnce I told some people, like on eof my friends, he was like UGH EW KOREANS. Luckily, my best friend was nice and didn't judge me, like I don't judge him. \n\nMy older sister (who's 20) reacted weirdly when I sent her a thread of Jungkook on Grammy Awards, wanting to see how she'd react, cause, well, I guessed he'd be her type. She said he looks like a girl. I was SHOOK. \n\nAgain, luckily, my lil sis loves BTS and I showed her a GOT7 MV of Just Right, and she was happilx giggling the whole time.\n\nI think the thing about people judging you is just the type of person you find. Let me say that in a better way lol. If a person judges you just for your favorite type of music or anything else, they're not your friend. A real friend would always help you and even take a listen, if they're interested. \n\nGuys and girls,  find yourself good friend just like the friends our favorite idols have.",

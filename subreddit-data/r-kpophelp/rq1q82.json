I think in addition to having really pretty vocal tones, they all make you feel something when they sing (at least for me). I think Doyoung and Taeyon especially I\u2019ve thought this about, they really seem to pour their all into what they sing and that makes it so much more enjoyable to listen to/watch:)\n\nEdit: Also Woosung from The Rose! He has such a unique tone, it\u2019s so distinct and one of my favorites!",

Okay, that\u2019s a slight exaggeration, but he *is* my fave kpop vocalist cuz his tone is just so strong and full and warm. I was listening to Don\u2019t Listen in Secret yesterday and said \u201cGODDAMMIT!\u201d when his verse came up. He\u2019s just SO. FUCKING. AMAZING.\n\nI also love Hui from Pentagon, whose voice is just so meaty and rich. I enjoy that it\u2019s often growly and not delicate. It punches you in the throat and you have no choice but to say thank you and ask for more.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s San from Ateez, who I feel is really good at playing around with his voice. It can be light and airy at times and then fuller and more bodied when needed. I always anticipate his parts cuz I just want his sweet voice to wash over me.",

BTS Jimin - his voice is so special that it draws you in. He has a high pitch voice (but his vocal range is quite broad). He can maintain the dynamic and tone really well. Serendipity and Promise are the best 2 to showcase his voice. \n\n3. AKMU Suhyun - she seriously has a princess voice. And she has so much vocal tone that goes well with any song. \n\n4. INFINITE Woohyun - natural vibrato and very emotional vocal",

He just has a gorgeous voice. \n\nJinsoul (Loona) has a deeper tone from the rest of the girls within her group. Her vocals are very clean and beautiful. She just has quite the unique vocal. They sound really amazing for someone who is almost considered a rapper.\n\nTaemin (SHINee/Solo/SuperM) his vocals are very up close and personal. Almost like he is whispering in your ear. He knows how to show different emotions through his vocal. It's really cool. \n\nJaehyun and Doyoung (NCT/NCT 127) Jaehyun is an excellent baritone and has an amazing vocal blend for this group. Again he was set to be a rapper but turned out to be an amazing vocal. His dynamics are amazing, stylistic choice are quite great too. Is versatility when it comes to harmonization is beautiful. \n\nDoyoung isn't a baritone but I feel doesn't get enough credit for the diversity of his vocals. Doyoung has a breathy/ airy vocal. This can make it hard to be a very dynamic singer. But Doyoung can belt his vocals and shows so much power within his vocal. His softer side is extremely delicate and as light as a feather. His strong side is full of punch. He has such an amazing vocal. \n\nOp covered most of my favorites. Baekhyun, Haechan, Doyoung, TAEILLLL!!!!&lt;33333, Onew, Wendy, Taeyeon, Sieun, and Wonpil are all such great pics for this post. And they are also some of my favs as well.",

I tried to pick live recordings so you could hear a little more of the natural tones I look for.  \n\n[Hoody - Adios](https://youtu.be/OufQLjzsISY?t=122)  Her dream like vocals are amazing, please check more of her stuff out if you like this.  \n\n[Minah (Girls Day) - A guy like me](https://youtu.be/6hhPbSVO7zs)  She has an amazing rasp reminiscent of Sia, but used judicially in her singing.  \n\n[Kim Jin Ho \\(SG Wannabe\\)](https://youtu.be/P6IXyHIxERo) I chose this one for pure power, and raw emotion that blends into an amazingly strong tone.\n\n[Isa/Yoon STAYC - I'll be there](https://youtu.be/OD2k86rKRI4) All of the girls kill it here, but the falsetto break from Isa kills me everytime (:50s in).  This is my rookie inclusion because I can see Yoon absolutely being considered a future powerhouse for vocals (:40s in).  One of the few groups out there who is actively singing live, and they are so incredibly stable.  They deserve all of the success they've seen recently. (And yeah I know BEP definitely did some mastering on this vocal, but I know they sound good without all the fancy remastering!)",

All of A.C.E have incredible voices but Donghun's really does it for me. There is so much depth and emotion in his voice. I saw them in Chicago the first time they toured and the first time I cried at a concert was when he and Chan covered All of Me .  [cover of Drivers License](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXpx62ggnIs), [Someone You Loved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5QCIWRiO3M) (with Jun and Chan and the best cover of this song ever IMO), [Leaving My Love Behind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twuCw44Nlog) cover (what can I say? A.C.E does kickass Capaldi covers), [random Donghun singing compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkbBtw34luA) (thank you Youtube)\n\nHe's currently doing Social Work for his military obligation but he has been keeping Choice fed on his Instagram (although I still miss his Vlives so much - so much singing when he was on!)\n\nEdit: edited because I realized I deleted a title (yes, Donghun and Chan covered All of Me)",

He might have his off days but he has an indescribable honey like quality to his voice that can't be replicated. My chest feels warm when I listen to him sing. I can't actually think of any one example right now, maybe film out?\n\nAs far as girls go, I mostly listen to soloist and Somi is a standout for me vocally, especially her earlier stuff.

Like in  [I'll Be There](https://youtu.be/FErTFtNXZRo), [Have a Good Night](https://youtu.be/TF16kE7y1rw) (with Minhyuk who also has a beautiful voice), [Perhaps Love](https://youtu.be/xyaHDuneyfM), [Now that I Found You](https://youtu.be/3wlgmBdQrW0).\n\n\nWoosung - no one else in kpop sounds like him- so full of emotion and soul. Examples: [ILYSB](https://youtu.be/vGx6XqaHFsk), [Lazy](https://youtu.be/pB9Hd3W2KCs) (this show is a gift from the gods), [Beautiful Girl ](https://youtu.be/8POT5M3SvZU), and we can't forget [She's in the Rain](https://youtu.be/V7deG88fT0I). I'm sobbing.  \n\n\nGaho. My pattern of soulful, melodic voices- he's so talented.  [Stay Here](https://youtu.be/-GHvBqysNHg), [Fly](https://youtu.be/29KU4UsRfsA), my fav [Then](https://youtu.be/lZf4sMs4ONQ) and his new album Fireworks.  \n\n\nYesung- sigh. \ud83d\ude0a [No More Love](https://youtu.be/eJuxi1viOw0), [Beautiful Night](https://youtu.be/lzTAdIAneKA), [Wherever you Are](https://youtu.be/tFvaugfTk9U), [Paper Umbrella ](https://youtu.be/sH0jdWpPv7o)",

But when he sang Love Poem by IU with BTOB Eunkwang and Ateez Jongho it was so easy to identify Seungmin and I think his voice was the most well suited for that song. It is powerful yet sweet and calming. I don't even know how to express what his vocals make me feel.",

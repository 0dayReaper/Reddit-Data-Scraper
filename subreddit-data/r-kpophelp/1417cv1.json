    "postText": "Hi all, this might be an odd request but I'm currently learning Korean and I had a thought about listening to Kpop songs and trying to \"decipher\" the Korean words in them into English to learn words. Problem is I have no clue what songs to start with so can anyone recommend me songs that fit the criteria? English is fine but I don't want it to have more English lyrics than Korean\n\nThanks",

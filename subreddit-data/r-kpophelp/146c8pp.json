In Korea they chart terrible, clearly association with Zico didn't do much for them, but that's the usual for new boy groups so that's nothing to worry about. For a Hybe debut it was pretty underwhelming tbh, like they aren't the strongest ROTY contenders so far and it doesn't seem like they caught the attention of international kpop fandom which is not typical for Hybe debuts. I'm sure they will gain some stronger momentum as they promote more tho.",

Xikers literally debuted and immediately started their variety show and tons of content and I love everything about it.

Like they don't have nearly as much content as Xikers do, but they had [an hour long debut show with variety content](https://youtu.be/AYgIhetsBNU) to start, which I thought showed off their chemistry pretty well. Since debut, they've been posting daily or better on Twitter and Weverse (where they write essays \ud83d\ude2d so much rookie enthusiasm!). Besides their dance challenge tiktoks they've posted a lot of silly tiktoks, we've also gotten plenty of behind the scenes videos, and two lives. This past week, we've gotten in-depth interviews daily from each of the members (only one left) and they talk about their hobbies, becoming a team, their contributions to the writing, choreo, and direction of their debut songs  ([Jaehyun](https://magazine.weverse.io/article/view?lang=en&amp;num=763), [Sungho](https://magazine.weverse.io/article/view?lang=en&amp;num=766), [Riwoo](https://magazine.weverse.io/article/view?lang=en&amp;num=768), [Woonhak](https://magazine.weverse.io/article/view?lang=en&amp;num=771), [Leehan](https://magazine.weverse.io/article/view?lang=en&amp;num=773), tomorrow will be Taesan). I also thought they were pretty clever in how they combined their promotions and the intro to the group--one of the teasers was doors for each of them decorated with their hobbies and they were weaved into the storyline of the MVs. \n\nI got into them pretty quickly bc of the constant content these past two weeks haha. Each day I wake up to plenty of stuff to catch up on. My hope is they'll get a variety show or something in a few months (I do wish it'll be sooner) but their personalities have shone through even with just what we have so far. I hope you'll check them out! Even if it's later when there's more content that's fine \ud83d\ude0a They're all very sweet and talented and enthusiastic and knocked on my heart and easily came in (despite no plans to haha \ud83e\udd2a).\n\nETA: [Taesan's interview is out now!](https://magazine.weverse.io/article/view?lang=en&amp;num=775)",

I feel like this is partly due to the fact that Hybe has been debuting too many groups and that the general public has no interest for a boy group. They\u2019ve only just debuted tho so it\u2019s not so catastrophic, they\u2019ll be able to redeem themselves.",

New Jeans, TXT, BSS, Seventeen, Lesserafim, and Enhypen have had comebacks continuously one after the other and a few BTS releases and solos..I think the fans just dont have enough time to catch up with all the content they put out because they are busy catching up with their favs content... most of them probably watched the MV and if they liked the song they probably added it to their playlists... I personally think they should have debuted in the second half of the year..",

Zico's influence is noticeable. Now he needs to grow with them.   \n\n\nThe debut happened at the best time for them. The new Pledis boy group is supposed to debut in the 3rd quarter of 2023. On June 30 \"R U NEXT?\" starts to find the new Belift girl group with 10 episodes. If no breaks, the group will be decided by early September. That possibly makes a debut time similar to Enhypen in the 4th quarter. The show for the US girl group might be on US TV by then, but as far as I've seen a debut in 2023 doesn't seem to be a thing.  \n\n\nAll those new groups in all these different labels &amp; that corporation still doesn't have as many groups as SM.",

So kneitizen have 0 interest in new bg\n- \u201cthey did not win any music show\u201d I think you all forgetting that their opponents are Enhypen, le sserafim, g idle and stray kids.

                    "comment": "lol the reason bgs are less popular isn't their music, it's a global pattern that men are more likely to be fans of female pop singers (or teenage girls, in a lot of kpop cases) than male ones, especially when that artist is perceived to have a large following of women. Until around the second half of 3rd gen, social media wasn't as prominent in kpop as it is today and kpop companies could make up for bgs' inherent difficulty with reaching the gp somewhat. Of course, their images/concepts, especially earlier, also needed to be adjusted to more general tastes, but once it was getting more difficult to cater to the gp, their concepts became more \"fandom-focused\" too in the sense they could safely do now anything regardless of whether it's trendy or simple , as long as it got the group fans at all.",

I guess people were expecting them to be some kind of chart monsters, but they\u2019re still a boygroup, people should be managing their expectations. They\u2019re still the highest performing bg debut of the year in almost every metric (time-relative Ofc). \n\nThey\u2019re not some explosive, never-been-seen-before success, but they\u2019re pretty quickly climbing in numbers and followers on all platforms. Even their MelOn numbers are climbing fairly rapidly. For a rookie group their numbers are actually pretty great. People just like doomposting about them for some reason \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

IMO they wanted to introduce them in a low-key way that was reminiscent of NewJeans (cos yeah it worked superbly for the girls), but that limited promotion strategy clearly did not work for them. They have good numbers for rookies, but for a Hybe group, they're underperforming.",

Considering that, they\u2019re doing great. Not even close to a flop or an actual underperformer, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll see some serious growth between this and their first comeback as they put more stuff out. I personally think Zico was scared to be seen as \u201cAnother Rain\u201d who won\u2019t let his group exist outside of his name, so he completely avoided associating with them at first, but it kinda wound up stunting them bc people who\u2019d have tuned in didn\u2019t even fully know they were a project from him.",

I don\u2019t usually follow Hybe groups so I wasn\u2019t informed about who was who and it wasn\u2019t until the day after that I realised they had to be Zico\u2019s group. They don\u2019t sound like him at all, he didn\u2019t show in the slightest. Which is good for them in a sense, but surely they could have used a little push from such a famous producer.",

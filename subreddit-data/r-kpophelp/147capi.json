    "postText": "i came across a fancam of hoshi performing a solo called \"touch\" at a concert, and i'd never heard of this solo song before, so i googled it and the only thing that came up was his perofrmance of this song at a concert. i also found a behind the scenes vid of woozi and hoshi recording the vocals, but i couldn't find any other info as to why this song was made? was it just for the concert? how did carats know about the song otherwise? and also if i'm correct i saw that every other member also had a solo song at that series of concerts? i'm confused. can someone help clarify? where did these songs come from/why were they made/how did fans know about them before the concerts?",

            "comment": "those are the ideal cut solo songs! i believe that most of the songs have only ever been performed twice as a surprise for fans, once during the [first seoul show](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg1Ucv_zLW1ZkuBxestFaE4lL7pP7Z0TC) and once for the [seoul encore show](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkm0hWKmCemBnKwYnMXMEVHoIvmed8F2z). most of these songs are surprises and made just for the concerts but otherwise never see the light of day or have a studio version. the only exceptions are the8's [night and rain](https://soundcloud.com/pledis_seventeen/seventeen-mixtape-vol16-the8), which was already a mixtape song he had released on soundcloud prior to the concert, and woozi's [what kind of future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v-MOJvobPM), which he plans on releasing in memory of moonbin.\n\nsome other examples of seventeen's unreleased concert songs are dino's [zero (hero)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYVbTMcx4eM) and [last order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iT2bavjchs), woozi [with you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3k_7yWoKbo), hoshi [hurricane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoHhFWV1SRw), hip hop unit [sukyo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJB2ZrN9gxc) &amp; [what's the problem + madness maxed out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H21A1OhK2s), wonwoo [joker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNAqECCizBA)\n\nalso for more solo songs check out seventeen's [17studio playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk_UmMfvZDx1Z6nDkIqwq1gB-X6Tvh9Bz)! it's got a combo of covers and solo releases",

    "postText": "It's easy to tell me whenever this situation comes up to just move on. But I find that hard to do. How am I supposed to do that when things became so ugly and toxic? Because my reaction to the fallout of that situation is very nuanced. There are aspects that I can accept and other aspects that I cannot accept. I can accept Garam being dismissed. That was 100% the correct decision. What I cannot accept is the way she was treated. From a public perspective, the management and the girls will have to pretend the whole thing didn't happen, but what about those who were following LSF at the time? Do I really have to pretend that debacle didn't happen in order to \"move on\" from it? Pretending the situation didn't happen won't help when to this day, I am still utterly appalled with the public reaction to it and with their thirst for knowing the tea.\n\nP.S. I wish every member of LSF (&amp; Garam) a bright and successful future!",

I doubt that you\u2019ll want to sit here in 2028 going \u201cman it sucks what happened to Garam\u201d \n\nThe best course of action is to accept that she is no longer a member, accept that the treatment of her by the public was terrible and accept her and LSF for who they are now.",

Garam has moved on as well and it will always annoy me how she was treated by some fans. She will keep living your life and I think we all need to as well. That's how the industry is, unfortunately.",

The length of time she was active in the group doesn't matter to me. I'm not trying to start a campaign of bringing her back as an idol. I am not disputing the company's decision to remove her from the group. What I am saying is that this whole fiasco should have never happened, the company should not have debuted her in the first place, and I hope HYBE's management (and netizens) learn from this. I am so proud of the girls for being able to overcome this unpleasant experience, but I will be wary of HYBE's responses to damaging controversies like this in the future.",

We literally watched a child get dragged with so much hate in real time. I also feel a disconnect when fandoms aggressively try to erase ex-members as if they were never there. I find that very weird. Anyway, I suggest taking a break from fandom spaces while still enjoying the content you like. I don't use twitter for fandom stuff anymore (only official accounts), I don't read comments on articles, youtube videos. When things get too toxic on here I disengage.",

    "postText": "So, I'm going to a TWICE concert in June and wanted a lightstick but everywhere I knew was either overlypriced, was going to take too long to ship, or sold out, I stumbled across KPOPTOWN despite not knowing anything about it. Has anyone ordered a lightstick or other merch from there? How long did it take and how was the quality? Thanks!",

They use DHL so be prepared to pay duties.  I bought 3, paid $108 cad for shipping and $45 cad in duty fees (so much less than I thought thank goodness and split 3 ways so yay) \n\nAll in all came to $111 cad per lightstick for me.  Got it by May 26 and I preordered it.",

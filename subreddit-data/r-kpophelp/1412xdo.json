    "postText": "I recently came across the song \"Whale\" by Kim Sejeong, and it reminded me of \"Shelter\" by Porter Robinson. So now I'm looking for other kpop songs that have a similar sound. The only one I could find myself was \"4 Memory\" by Dreamcatcher. Can someone give me a couple of recommendations?",

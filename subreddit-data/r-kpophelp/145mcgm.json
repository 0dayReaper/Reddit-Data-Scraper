For a very long time, The Recording Academy (the organization that puts on the Grammy Awards) has had a huge problem with diversity. It is a long and complicated issue, so I can't get into it here. You can google for more info. TRA has been working on increasing diversity among membership and leadership for a few years now.",

That\u2019s literally racism, forcing diversity is racist. You give a handicap to talented people because their skin color and give the award to another race that hasn\u2019t won in x amount of years, is racist.",

From The Recording Academy (the organization that puts on the Grammys and whose eligible voting members vote) website:\n\n&gt;Submissions for GRAMMY consideration through \\[Online Entry Process\\]\u202fcan only be made by registered Media Companies and Academy Members (Voting and Professional). Registered Companies are not permitted to vote in the GRAMMY Awards Process. Companies will receive OEP instructions by email pending registration approval. [source](https://www.recordingacademy.com/news/2023-grammys-online-entry-period-oep-webinar-invite-how-to-submit-music-nominations)\n\nFIFTY FIFTY can have people submit on their behalf, but do they or their agency know anyone who is willing to do that? It could happen if they have a US record or distribution deal. Do they have that?\n\nThe second problem is if Recording Academy members would vote for them. Based on discussions I have had with voting members in the past, that is highly unlikely.",

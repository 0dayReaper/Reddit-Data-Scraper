Was it through the official site or a different one?\n\nIf you did buy 4 VIP tickets through the official site during presale and only two of them are showing as VIP, there's definitely an issue there. All tickets should have a QR code/Scan code for entering the venue, not just two out of the four.\n\nI am not familiar with this tour, but looking at their recent posting for tickets on ticketmaster, there is no specific ticket for fan club - only two tiers of VIP. So, if you bought four VIP tickets but only two of them show fan club, I wouldn't worry about that as fan club refers to the presale itself and not the tier of the ticket. That's just my assumption though, maybe someone more familiar with this tour can give a better answer.",

The presale was weird so I couldn\u2019t choose vip specifically, just random seats for random prices. \n\nI choose 4 tickets in the same areas, just separated. Like 2 in section bb and 2 in section cc. \n\nThe 2 in bb say \u201cmarque club\u201d which is a thing through fox theater and not for the tour/idle. \n\nThe 2 in cc say \u201cfan club\u201d which is a thing for the tour/idle. It has no details on/with the tickets though as to what this means. I was wondering if it was the vip tickets or something different.",

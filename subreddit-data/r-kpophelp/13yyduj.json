    "postText": "I was at a Korean steakhouse recently, and they play Kpop throughout the restaurant. From what I remember, they just use a YouTube playlist and will occasionally search up specific songs to play (You can see them search on the TVs throughout). \n\nI cannot remember much of the song itself, but I know it is a boy group and, in the video, I believe they were on stage, but it wasn't a concert. It almost looked like the video was for a sound check/unplugged kinda thing, but I'm not certain. They each took the camera and passed it around to each other while they were singing.\n\nI have been searching for this song for about an hour and am at a complete loss as to what I could even try to search for next.",

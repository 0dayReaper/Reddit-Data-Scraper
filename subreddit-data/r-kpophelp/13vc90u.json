    "postText": "Hi, I'm new to purchasing Kpop albums. After watching unboxing videos on YouTube, I was interested in the special photocards that certain stores give with albums, namely Ktown4u. I recently bought an album from them and didn't get any special photocards, and I don't recall any of the item/version pages mentioning store photocards.\n\nHow do I get store photocards? Or how do I know if a purchase comes with special photocards?\n\nPlease and thank you!",

            "comment": "These photocards are often called POBs or Preorder Benefit cards, which means you have to preorder the album before the album release date to get them. If a POB is available it will show up in the ktown4u shopping cart when you check out as an extra gift listing in your checkout cart.",

            "comment": "If you mean pre order benefits, those usually only come when you order during the pre order period. Most stores have their own versions and that's how a lot of people choose where to buy from. But I don't think they're sent with orders after the release. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.",

You either entered for videocall/fansign which had 6 photocards or you entered for the in person listening session which also had 6 random photocards. \n\nThen other sites like Makestar were similar, 3 video call photocards, 3 fansign photocards. There was 3 rounds of that resulting in 18 POB type photocards.\n\nIt's getting a bit insane now to collect non-album photocards.",

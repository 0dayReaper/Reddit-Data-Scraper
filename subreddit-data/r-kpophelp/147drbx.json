    "postText": "Need some advice on what to do. I was lucky enough to secure a ticket for one of the dates for Follow at Gocheok.\n\nMy interpark and Carat membership first name and last name match. However on my passport, my middle name is technically on the same line as my first name (USA passport). So in a very techncial since my middle name is not displayed on the interpark ticket I bought as well as my carat membership.\n\nIt looks like I will be unable to change my name in interpark or the fanclub membership to include my middle name. Any advice? My own credit card that I purchased with just has my first and last name (like interpark/membership).\n\nExample:\n\nCarat Membership: Jane Doe\n\nInterpark ticket: Jane Doe\n\nPassport: Jane Middle Name, Doe\n\nCredit Card: Jane Doe\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot sure if it even helps but even my university diploma only indicates 'Jane Doe'",

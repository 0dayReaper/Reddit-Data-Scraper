    "postText": "I know the whole point of pr stunts is that they're believed by the public, but are there any instances in kpop where it's plausible, if not down right obvious, that they were pr stunts? It's all down to speculation ofc, but are there any times where an idol did smth to soften their image after a scandal? Or smth to quickly generate contention around them as they were losing relevancy?\n\nGranted, I have limited knowledge on pr in general lol, so I genuinelly can't tell if they're common, if theres a reason they're scarce or not etc.\n\nI am genuinely just curious; this is not incited by anything in particular I literally have no clue how to spot a pr stunt or if there's anything that could be considered one in the kpop sphere lmao",

Both companies knew that whoever released first would reign in the charts for no more than a week before whoever released second took their spot and stayed there, so it was a battle to be the second group to release.",

I remember SNSD were called 9 Mannequins and 2NE1 were 2NO1. It's funny looking back on it now but in the moment the entire situation was so unhinged, especially for me being fans of both.\n\nI remember Sones and Blackjacks bickering over who was going to win that one music show, and then 4Minute comes out of no where and takes the win \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. Still one of the funniest kpop moments I've experience.",

Idols should not have to apologize for every single thing they do when it\u2019s not wrong. If it became the standard and idols did talk about the member that left/had to leave, met up with their past member, companies having the accused member rejoin. Like the whole situation with Woojin? SKZ members should\u2019ve been able to go out and \u201cno, he did not bully us. Behave like decent human beings and leave him alone\u201d. This all boils down to tiny mistakes being blown out of proportion, completely normal things not being accepted, idols being harassed online having their careers ruined because of bitter ugly people. Before the whole collab TikTok thing blew up idols couldn\u2019t even interact with each other(for a few years). \n\nHow about Jungkook having to kindly ask his \u201cfans\u201d not to stalk him or send food to his home? This is not good for the future of Kpop. \n\nRant about finished.",

Maybe it's because they're an older group and have more say in their careers. \n\nSome fandoms are very chill about dating and marrying. iKONICS to mind. But even for them  B.I rejoining the group would be too far. Although I personally would like it. (and, yes, I know he was actually guilty).",

The two just casually out and about, also revealing they were both in Paris(?) by sharing similar photos on their instagrams. Also Jennie having a puppy named Kai and people saying she named the dog after him. I was like okay this is definitely for publicity. Then boom a month later, after both were done promoting their comebacks, they were no longer together. \n\nI know a lot of fans, even me, thinks they actually did date, but I also think it was publicity for EXO and Jennie who were both promoting comebacks at that time. Other relationships didn\u2019t reveal how they knew each other, who asked who first, etc.. but we got almost all the intel on Jennie and Kai relationship",

I\u2019m honestly skeptical about whether it really was a PR stunt - it just doesn\u2019t make sense to distract the public from Girls\u2019 Generation and EXO by\u2026. Faking a relationship between members of Girls\u2019 Generation and EXO, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard anyway.",

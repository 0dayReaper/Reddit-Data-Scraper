            "comment": "It's simply considered Kpop! Kpop is a very interesting genre because there is a lot that falls under that umbrella. So what, in particular, did you like about I Wish? I think I could recommend better toward your taste if I knew that. Otherwise I can simply say, check out FT Island overall, they've got a wide variety of sounds and approaches and they're always good.",

I listen to ft island quite a lot and i agree with you.\n\nWhat i like in particular about I Wish is the music is the rythm, the structure of the song, that it gradually builds up to the chorus, and just the way theyre singing it, if that makes sense? \nI agree with you that there is a lot under the kpop umbrella, but i was looking for something a little more specific under that umbrella. I read somewhere that the song is classified as pop rock with spanish influences?\n\nI know very little about music genres and i dont know any music terms, so i apologise on beforehand in case i offend someone.",

It's of a completely different genre but has a similar beat albeit slower while Jami Sould x Sol'Flower's [I, Tears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0xQGcGXX70) is a little faster. I think Deadbuttons's [Nothing But You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iauMiA-S3I) has a similar chord progression and beat in their verses as 'I Wish'.",

People are always pointing to like a G5 and calling it a whistle \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. Like no babes.\n\nAlso, while possible, it's *very* rare for men to be able to hit whistle notes, and nearly non-existent in pop music. Falsetto is not necessarily the same as whistle (there're lots of differing debates about male whistle capabilities that are way too convoluted and divisive to argue here lol)\n\nWhistle notes are traditionally believed to begin around a C6-D6, and go to the very top of human high note capabilities. Technique is also a part of the classification.",

Fromis_9's Hayoung pulled off one in DM, and that's pretty much it. Sohyang is known for having that range, but she's not at all pop. Siyeon from Dreamcatcher can also hit them notes. Cha Soo Kyung (was in a group called Daisy, and then became famous for an OST she did later on) has a good command and sings Mariah Carey songs easily.",

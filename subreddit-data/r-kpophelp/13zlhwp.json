    "postText": "Of course there are tutorials for learning choreo and stuff but I mean like learning basics and becoming a better dancer\n\nI remember in idol producer Lay Zhang said like his first dance lesson was just all of them nodding for 3 hours or something like that, then the next one was like learning to push your chest out for 3 hours and it was just super basics and fundamental based\n\nThat\u2019s what I mean like basics and fundamentals and I guess getting better balance etc rather than just learning moves/choreo\n\nYouTube or I\u2019m down for whayever tbh. It seems like a lot of the paid \u201ckpop dance\u201d type courses and stuff out there are more about learning specific choreo tho",

I did notice that in some of the tutorials, however, a couple movements were altered. If you\u2019re more focused on improving, however, her channel is pretty great. I would also recommend putting on some songs and just dancing - when you\u2019re a beginner, it helps get your body more used to dancing. You may feel awkward at first, but it helps a lot!! I had a playlist of my favourite dancing songs with a good beat.\n\nYou might also want to check out the Steezy channel on YouTube - you will need to look through their playlists though, because they also post choreo videos, dance analysis, and interview choreographers.",

I may start one of the 30 day series tomorrow :D any other sources kinda like this? \n\nYeah I was thinking the same thing about singing! That\u2019s a great idea for dance too. Ive been practicing singing to try and perfectly (or as perfect as I can \ud83d\ude05) rehearse songs (only English parts bc my korean is pretty bad rn) bc it\u2019s more fun to with songs you love",

    "postText": "I can totally understand they wanting to take a break of it or even decide to no longer do it, but what's the reason of putting their twitter accounts private or even delete them? This making everybody no longer have access to those beautiful pictures. Or ok, delete or make private your twitter account but idk maybe provide a link to a website where we can still see them/download them? Anyone knows the reason of this or knows more about the topic?

            "comment": "It really depends on what the people behind the accounts are going through and how they're coping with it. In some cases, they might not be interested in the artist anymore, and they want to get rid of everything they kept as their fans. Sometimes they decide not to keep their platform running anymore because they set certain boundaries regarding how they want other users to appreciate or use their photos, but their followers did not follow suit. (eg. reposts, making personal merch off the photos without permission, personal edits/logo removal) Going inactive or private is fairly common when the fansite owner's personal life interferes with them running their accounts. Some of them switch their fansites to private and never return.",

    "postText": "THEY'RE SO GOOD. I don't know if there's anyone else producing such quality content. I miss their uploads but I suppose even if they're coming back it takes loads of time to produce one video, especially since it's just a hobby. I mostly want just music related, kinda education focused channel recs. I don't like \"opinion/analysis/ranking\" channels since it creates unnecessary drama, whether or not it's intentional. Additionally if any forums discuss just the music theory-esque aspects of kpop I would love to know about them too. (I know about reacttothek but I'm moreso looking at something more interactive. I feel their focus is mostly on stuff that classical musicians might have something to say about, and they're really big so discussion/recs aren't possible atp). I've recently become more serious about learning music theory and learning piano and would love to learn/discuss it since I enjoy it. ALSO does anyone know if they (ie 2ndgenbias) have any public socials?\n\n(I tried to add a link to the channel but couldn't so I'll try to add it in the comments)",

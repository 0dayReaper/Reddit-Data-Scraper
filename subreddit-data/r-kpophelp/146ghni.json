    "postText": "Hi guys!\nSo I\u2019m seeing TWICEs Dallas (Arlington) show on the 21st of the month and I want to make freebie bracelets! I was wondering what kind of bag or holder to bring them in, where I can pass them out? Things like that!\nI\u2019m also wondering if it\u2019s appropriate to make bracelets specific to certain members like for example a nayeon one or a momo one? Or should I stick to one\u2019s that are for all members so there\u2019s no bias mix up? Or should I let people pick out whatever they want?",

I live in Michigan - just became a \"Once\" fan this year - &amp; am kinda bummed out that Chicago is the closest tour venue. But even MORE so, how insanely expensive their concert tickets are. Oh well... thankfully there's YouTube. \ud83e\udef0",

Before the show after people are seated would be hard with a huge venue.\n\nI think it's fine to make member specific ones. Even if one runs out, I think people will still be happy / grateful getting another member besides their bias. You could also make some Twice / OT9 ones.",

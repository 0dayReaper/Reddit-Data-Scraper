I think you can use them if you live in Europe but im not sure if you're in the USA or elsewhere. \n\ni usually buy from musica and they sell many posters. i bought the txt minisode pink pastel website looking poster? and it's pretty big. i know that when i bought nct dream glitch mode, i got the HUGE poster that goes with it. \n\ni just checked for musica and for ex, they sell the huge aespa my world poster (92 x 61) but they don't sell the ateez outlaw poster yet. if you're from Europe, i would definitely check if they sell the posters when the album is out!!!",

            "comment": "Seconding music plaza, sometimes if you're ordering other things like albums, you can also add a poster to your cart and get it for free (though I can't remember if it has to be a poster that is from the same group/artist as the albums you're buying, or even more specifically from the same specific release, or if it can be a poster that's totally different from the albums you're also buying). Seconding mercari as well, sometimes there's people reselling them who got them elsewhere. \n\nIf there is no official merch posters/or you don't care about if it's official merch or not, and it's a popular group, then you can usually find some unofficial ones on amazon.",

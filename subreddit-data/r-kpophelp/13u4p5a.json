    "postText": "Hello everyone, I was considering making a fan account of one of my favorite groups which is unfortunately extremely nugu. And it probably wouldn't do much but I was genuinely considering to make an account to talk about them, share their news and pics from several social media all in one (like most fan accounts do). I can even translate their content for possible spanish speakers since that's my main language (their official content is usually translated to english so I can do that much).\n\nThe problem is, I don't leave in korea. I can't assist to their concerts, and the stuff they do in korea and my only source of information is the official accounts and each of the members personal media account. I don't know if that's enough to justify making a fan twitter (or insta) account or if it's expected I have something else to offer.\n\nI just have the feeling other fan accounts I follow always seem to have breaking news and I honestly don't know how they do it and my main goal is to make this group more popular but also being a reliable place to read info on this particular group.\n\nTo people who follows fan accounts or non-official news accounts from your fav groups. What do you expect from them? What is the bare minimum you think these accounts should offer?\n\nI'd love to do it but I'd feel like 99% of my content would just be translations and reposted pics, videos and news from their official sources. And since it's a really nugu group the only trustworthy place is their official pages and I don't know if that's not good enough. They do appear in radio programs as well but they're in korean and I'd unfortunately be unable to translate that content (other than inform that it's happened). My korean is really limited so I don't know if it's a good idea making this, but they really need the support and since I didn't find many (or any) other person doing what I was planning to do then that's why I'm writing this.\n\nSorry for my disordered chaotics thoughts I hope the post makes some kind of sense.",

I've seen many that just share pictures of a specific member and important news updates. \n\nYou can find a translating account and translate Spanish for your followers.\n\nI'm pretty casual when it comes to twitter, the only thing that matters for me is the artist upcoming schedules like contents, radio appearances, and concerts where the company don't announce. (These rumors or ads come from the Korean fans' forum)",

For example I mostly reside on Twitter and don't use TikTok or Instagram so I appreciate it when that stuff gets reposted on Twitter, otherwise I would never see it LOL! \n\nI think you should totally do it!! Since you stan a small group I'm sure their fans will be happy to have any fanbase, if you provide translations and reposted pics, videos and news from their official sources that's more than enough! Maybe later you could try to recruit a translator that speaks korean to help you. Good luck!!!",

Of course having deeper understanding in the language would help but if you don\u2019t really plan on having this account as crucial part of your life (like being major source of profit) but something just for fun and engagement you could wait till you get translated sources.",

I don't know any of the drama, scandals, news, nothing at all, so I feel like I'm missing a lot here. \n\nOn her most recent post, I'm seeing so many \"lazy idol\", \"p0rn star\" and just pure pure hate and I'm so confused why? I know she's in The Idol but i haven't watched it yet, is that why?\n\nAnd there are soooo many hate accounts that i just discovered that are dedicated to her. It's actually really scary ngl. Does anyone know at all why?",

            "comment": "There have always been female idols who get a lot of very nasty misogynistic hate towards them, more than the average female idol. For instance Sulli, Jennie and Wonyoung. I think it comes from a lot of jealousy and hatred towards women who are unapologetic about how they live. \n\nFor instance, Sulli posting photos of herself without a bra. Jennie dating and going clubbing and dancing. It's like they are ok with women who act in 'acceptable' ways, but not women who are too confident in themselves and act in ways they do not agree with.\n\nAnd a lot of it comes from people who hate blackpink as a whole as well. None of the members have had attitude scandals - they all seem to get along really well with their staff and have great connections in the industry, so people make shit up about how they hate their fans and are lazy and only want to be influencers.",

My take on things are that people who already hated her anyway are using the controversy surrounding the show to paint her in a worse light because they are perpetually riding the hate train. Additionally, others who may have liked her before or had a neutral opinion see her role on the show as degrading to her idol image and therefore have completely shifted their opinion on her because of it. Personally, I don\u2019t really care what she does with her life but I\u2019m just giving my observation of the situation based off what I\u2019ve seen online.",

People love to try to tear down a girl when she so clearly doesn't care what they think. \n\nThe thing is people always start out loving these girls and then find a reason to turn on them when they get \"too popular\". It happened a while ago for Jennie, around last year for wonyoung, I'm pretty sure the newest victim of this is going to be Yunjin from le sserafim. People went from loving her to hating her in an instant and she didn't even do anything.\n\nYunjin wrote a trilogy of solo songs about this and even if you're not into kpop these songs hit really hard when you look at it through the eyes of someone that knows they're under a microscope at all times. Raise y_our glass, i\u2260doll, and love you twice. Blackpink also has a song about this called Tally and similar themes in you never know and love to hate me. It's sadder when you realize they're well aware of this stuff and have to choose to isolate themselves from it. Wonyoung even said in an interview recently that she won't search for herself on the internet.",

In fact, I saw a clip just yesterday of Jisoo missing a performance.\n\nIt just seems so unnecessary. People love to rant about how toxic BP fanbase can be, but it seems like BP hate is just as toxic. There were some people complaining about Jennie's guesting on Taeyang's song recently, when she clearly killed it. Unless it's all being done by toxic Jisoo solo stans, which can't be true, BP fanbase being toxic at times has always felt a bit like protectiveness. People seem to find BP easy to pick on. BP members present as super wholesome people who seem to genuinely like each other and have never said or done anything egregious and just like to hang out with their pets and do cool stuff.\n\nIt's not just about popularity because BTS hate has lost a bit of edge over the years, and BP hate seems the same.",

Hell, I'm even embarrassed to know some of them personally. Very fine people on the outside, but if you see their timeline or happen to know their alt accounts.....yikes! My own sister was a Blackpink anti, and though she did not participate in spreading hate comments (or so she says), I grew tired of her making snide remarks about Blackpink enough for me to call her out about it. \n\nI really don't get why people spend energy spreading hate. That is nothing to be proud of, and only makes that person look pathetic. They may hate Jennie Kim (or any idol, really) and write cruel and demeaning stuff about her. At the end of the day, they're just another asshole behind a computer, saying bad stuff about an idol who has got more money and opportunity than they'll ever have.",

It's not just a sexual character, it's a disgusting sexploitation show, something really niche that almost nobody will enjoy. Her fans will sit through it to support her, but they will be disgusted because that's the reaction most human beings would have watching that show.\n\nOf course it's mostly Lily Depp's character providing the sexploitation gore, and Jennie will likely be exempted due to being Jennie, but that makes it even weirder to see that Jennie will be exempted from doing gross stuff and going naked while the other lesser-known actresses are going through it. In the second episode, another girl with a role similar to Jennie's role is seen bent over getting fucked from behind by a guy she just met. And I think Lily Depp's character is seen kneeling and giving a blowjob. It's super cringe in both cases. And it's like why?\n\nI think Jennie's career will be unaffected because the show is a flop and most people will never know about it and it will be instantly forgotten. But since it's airing right now I can see why she's getting hate comments. It's a very controversial show. Anyone who's involved in it would get hate comments, that's what happens when you make controversial art. Lily Depp and the director would also get hate comments, but at least Lily Depp's acting skills are good.",

Jennie has always been the member with the most haters but more recently, a lot of her hate has been coming from kpop stans criticizing her appearance on a new HBO tv series called \u201cThe Idol\u201d because of the mature themes of the show and the type of character she plays. I haven\u2019t watched it either but, I\u2019ve seen some of the scenes fans have been circulating online (the one where she\u2019s dancing with male dancers) and it\u2019s a very drastic difference from the clean, innocent idol image she\u2019s and female idols are expected to uphold. I personally don\u2019t give a fuck about this and fans need to grow up and get over it. She\u2019s making moves to secure a future after BlackPink and I\u2019m here for whatever she wants to try as long as it isn\u2019t hurting her or other people.\n\nThere\u2019s also the controversy surrounding her energy at her own concerts and if fans are getting their money\u2019s worth from them (but, imo this is more of a group issue this time than it is a problem with just a single member). \u201cBlackPink / Jennie is lazy\u201d has followed them around for years and I\u2019m not going to lie, sometimes it gets kinda difficult to defend them with some of the fancams I\u2019ve seen over the years. However, BP has been pretty busy in 2023. They\u2019ve been touring for months now and have had several performances at various events across the world + all 4 members are also embarking on more solo activities this year as well. But at recent shows, some fans and internet stans have begun to point out the obvious differences between the members\u2019 performances and the lack of energy/enthusiasm from them overall. I\u2019ve seen some fancams on tik tok and I do have to agree with some people, Lisa really is the only one that looks to be giving her 100%, 100% of the time. From what I\u2019ve read online, the members have been sick, overworked and are not getting the rest they need to continue performing as frequently or as long as they do. There have been accounts of members vomiting during rehearsals, photos of Jennie performing with an IV, Jisoo performing with/right after having COVID, Jennie leaving the stage mid-performance bc she was going to faint, etc. It honestly sounds like a shit show behind the scenes but, I\u2019m not sure how accurate everything is because a lot of this is unverified and comes from BP Twitter stans.\n\nAs a human with empathy, I wish that the girls were treated better by their company, I wish that they had adequate time to rest and were able to take care of their bodies as people who need rest and not as idols who need to maintain a certain, physical image. The expectation kpop stans have for idols are impossible to live up to and using, \u201cit\u2019s her job\u201d to validate online bullying and harassment is primitive and people like that only perpetuate the negative stigma kpop fans get. You need therapy and a life if you\u2019re a toxic stan. As a consumer and long time kpop fan, Blackpink tickets are *expensive* and can be hundreds of dollars, some tickets even reaching over $1k. If I paid that much money to go to any concert, I would hope I get a show that\u2019s worth what I spent. Even though the personal attacks care uncalled for, I do think that the criticism regarding their concert performances hold some validity, especially if people and fans are spending their money to see them. I would rather wait a few months for them to be well-rested and healthy than to go to a concert where the artists look like they\u2019re about to pass out.\n\nI\u2019m a firm believer that you cannot give 100% if you aren\u2019t at 100% yourself and whether it\u2019s their choice to continue touring or not, I just hope that they get a break from work and also the relentless hate they get.",

That's something you need to prepare for... but I don't think YG did their due diligence and just pushed them to tour without the proper prep.",

From that perspective, it\u2019s easy to see why they hate her.  \n\nIf Jennie wanted to be an actress and successful her best move would have been to completely leave Blackpink and do that route.

Jennie being part of a BP also plays a part bc fans get jealous for whatever reason and now with her being in The Idol adds to the fuel of shaming aswell as the dating rumor with her a Tae. It\u2019s children pretty much, they have nothing better to do.",

            "comment": "Not a k-pop fan but came across this post. For me the explanation is that, the more popular you are, the more likely you are to be hated. As with any popular celebrity, there will always be haters. And haters are going to do what they do best - - hate. I'm not a celebrity, but if it were up to me, I would just completely ignore them. The true fans would stick by who they look up to in good times and in bad times. It's absolutely pathetic to hate on someone for living their life to the fullest. Hating on someone because they're with a certain person? Seriously? I see this quite a bit (Celeb A dating X, fans don't like X, so they hate on X or Celeb A) and it makes no sense. There are celebs that do they get affected by the hate (end up being depressed, taking their own lives, quitting the industry, etc..) but that's because no two celebs or persons in general, are the same, and that's quite sad. To me haters are the ones that have very little going on with their lives and they have too much free time on their hands. Don't like the work of your on-screen/on-stage heroes? Don't watch them. Nobody is forcing anyone to consume and like what any of them are putting out.",

The strategy has always been \"starve the fans of content until they are rabid and will buy anything .... then release something\"\n\nIn the first 1.5 years Blackpink released 9 songs. 4 in the year after that. A year later \"The Album\" added 8 more. Then finally 8 more with the newest album. That's 29.\n\nCompare to say Itzy (2019) who are at 45? Twice (2016) who are only 1 year before have 176 ... ish ... it was getting a bit hard to count. And IZ\\*One ... a group whose entire career fits entirely inside Blackpink's and existed for half the number of years was somewhere around 43 songs.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m still relatively new to kpop. I recently bought my first album - I feel cat ver. - And pulled a soyeon photocard. Since I cant post photos the best way I can describe it is the same location/outfit as the poster you get of her in the album with two peace signs. I looked it up online and cannot find it anywhere. Is it a store exclusive/rare situation? or am I just stupid",

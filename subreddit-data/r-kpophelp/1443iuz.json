    "postText": "I was scrolling through YouTube and a video of 2017 MAMA came to my feed, in that exo was crying, I thought it was because they won a daesang (?) But apparently the comments said that mama physically assaulted the fans and changed the rules for exo just a few hours before the ceremony? I checked for more comments to see what was happening but none of them told anything more and I searched again but didn't find any article or video precisely talking about anything other that happened, they all only talked about exo crying because they won the daesang(?)\n. Can someone explain to me, what exactly happened?",

Fans were also mistreated during the awards event. They were pushed by barricades and received huge physical violance by Mnet staff members. EXO cried seeing their fans suffering from physical and inner pain because of them.\n\nWhen EXO won the award for best album, Baekhyun said to EXOLs: \"We won the award, now you can rest and go home, thank you for your hard work, see you here in the same place next year!\"\n\nEXO did never participate in MAMA again after this, which is totally understandable. I wouldn\u2018t want to see EXO and their fans being mistreated like that again. EXO doesn\u2018t need those MAMA awards to be successful and do their own thing. \n\nI still remember that day and was deeply saddened by the pictures of the members crying, while hearing what happened. Mnet truly sucks, EXO and EXOL deserve better.",

I get the kpop artists have to fly to different countries (and tbh I think the price is justified, they're so fun!). \n\nAre normal/western concerts different? Are they shorter? Or maybe less energy or something?",

It\u2019s not really an all day event that many kpop concerts are.

Also no slogans, official or fan made. \n\nEvery Western concert I\u2019ve gone to has a tour shirt with all the tour stops and dates listed on the back, and this seems to be less of a staple for kpop concerts, though I have seen some for certain shows",

But it depends how big the artist is and what type of venue it is. When I saw Green Day at a stadium we were waiting outside the venue all day, and were able to get right at barricade inside. But I've been to shows at a smaller venue, but with bands who were a similar genre, and maybe almost as well known, and I don't think they even let people line up outside until like 20-30 min before doors open. (Though plenty of people would still be there before then, but they'd just go buy merch since that area had a separate entrance, or they'd go to the bar next door if they were old enough, and wait.) But even at stadium shows where people might wait all day to get a good spot for a well known artist, I've never seen merch booths outside or people giving freebies or anything like that, that might be at kpop concerts. I kind of wish western venues or concert goers would adopt these practices.",

I totally wasn\u2019t thinking about GA since I\u2019ve only ever done seated, but you make a good point about lining up early regardless of k-pop or western. I guess the unique thing about kpop then would just be non-GA people showing up early for merch or to just hang out\n\nTotally agree about the freebie thing, I think it\u2019s so cute. Stuff like that makes it feel like so much more of a community at kpop shows!!",

Ticket prices for western artists can vary, depending on the venue size, seating location, general admission tickets, and how popular the artist is. Without the extra fees, I think the lowest I paid for a non-kpop concert ticket was $16 and that was a general admission standing ticket in a small venue for a lesser known artist (at that time). The most I've paid was probably $100ish and that was for a big name artist in a huge arena for a seat closer to the stage.  \n\nAs others have mentioned, western concerts typically have 1 or 2 opening acts, and people tend to arrive an hour or two before the show at the earliest. The crowd energy has been amazing at most of the shows I've been to. And the concert length is pretty much the same length as most kpop concerts.",

Concert prices depends on your location and venue (and seats selection) usually, but of course demand is a major factor too. Have you seen prices for Taylor Swift or Blink182 this year. Non kpop concerts have a wide range of differences depending on the artists/genre, so there's not a dichotomy of kpop vs everything else. If you go see a newer artist at a small venue, or an mid tier artist at a large venue, your chances of getting cheap tickets are good.",

I've been to two JP anisong concerts in the US and the crowds were still loud and rowdy lol. The main difference between Western events and specifically Japanese events is the audience reaction. In Japanese events, a crowd of 30,000+ can get pin-drop silent when the artist is performing, only to cheer as soon as the last note leaves the air. And their fan chanting and light stick work are THE BEST. Not to mention they start absolutely on the dot.\n\nAttending JP events have completely spoiled me for Western concerts!

            "comment": "I actually haven\u2019t really attended western shows myself much, but I have some experience in marketing and event management, plus my parents attend western concerts very frequently (in Europe) and I like watching concert videos and vlogs in my freetime - so I\u2019ll weight in with what I think to know anyway :)\n\nWhile comparable western artists exist, a lot of western concerts can also just be the artist performing their songs on stage with little to no choreography, outfit-changes or props - just the music. They also often have opening acts, which is very uncommon in Kpop, where the same group will typically perform the entire runtime.\n\nKpop concerts are usually always in the \u201espectacle\u201c-category along with acts like Taylor Swift where the tickets tend to be higher from the get-go due to a higher budget being spent on the concert itself - props, special effects, backup dancers, VCRs,\u2026\n\nAnother thing that drives the price up depending on where you live is that many western shows more \u201elocal\u201c (American artists performing in the US or European artists performing in Europe), where less money goes into moving - at a Kpop concert the group (which already consists of several people) plus their managers, and in some cases back up dancers, have to travel from Korea to another continent on long and expensive flights - typically in business class / first class to avoid fans trying to interact with them during the flight. In some cases they\u2018ll also transport a number of props. Once they\u2018re at the destination they\u2019ll need accommodations and food for all the people involved, often for a few days to avoid being jet lagged for the performance.\n\nAnother thing that probably also goes into cost is that Kpop concerts tend to be a whole day activity (if you want it to be) - they will often offer different activities and photo-ops around the venue which have to be set up and managed by security staff. \n\nThe culture around the concerts probably depends a lot on the fanbase- the culture around acts like Harry styles and Taylor swift seems very similar to what you see in Kpop, while other acts might have a very different culture when it comes to how you dress or act at the concert.",

When I went to see H.E.R in 2022 it was only about 2 hours long but when I went to see TWICE in LA it was 3 hours plus!\n\nAnother thing is the concert outfits \ud83d\ude2d most western concerts people don\u2019t really go all out in their outfit and trying to pull it into an artist concept unlike kpop concerts. This doesn\u2019t affect the concert experience at all of course but just something else I noticed!",

            "comment": "Many have said about kpop not having opening acts but I also want to add that this makes the kpop concerts longer. The actual time you're inside is about the same, but instead of waiting for the first opening act with mediocre sound quality, then waiting for the second opening act with slightly better sound then waiting *again*, finally, for the act you came to see which only lasts about an hour or so (or sometimes less in my experience) with the full sound experience, the kpop act you went to see is performing that entire time at top quality.\n\nThere are a few western acts that come to mind as having similar concerts, like Lady Gaga, Beyonce and Taylor Swift, but by and large western concerts are a small affair in comparison to kpop ones.",

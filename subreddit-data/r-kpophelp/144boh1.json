    "postText": "Here's a summary of a lot of information I gathered about K-pop history and how I think changes in political relations between Korea and other countries ended up affecting the current K-pop scene.\n\nBasically, from the beginning, K-pop was thought of as an export product. K-pop's first expansion was into Japan with Boa and TVXQ. Then K-pop infiltrated China and the SEA. But despite coming first in Japan, K-pop's main focus for most of the 2000s and at least half of the 2010s was China. No wonder SM's first foreign idol was a Chinese.\n\nWhat happened was that over the years the political relations between China and South Korea deteriorated, to the point that in 2016 a process of distancing between the two countries began, which ended up leading to the banning, or at least restrictions of good part of Korean entertainment, mainly K-pop and K-dramas. Until today, for example Korean idols cannot promote in Chinese territory, which also ended the possibility of K-pop concerts in China.\n\nThen we come to 2017 and we have two events that were fundamental to the success of K-pop today. First we had TWICE's debut in Japan, which ended up resulting in the Japanese public's interest in K-pop again. As far as I know, K-pop has been weak in Japan in the years leading up to 2017, but TWICE's wild success has brought interest in K-pop back. No wonder, TWICE members are credited with improving Japanese-Korean relations.\n\nIn the same year of 2017, on the other side of the world, we had BTS exploding in the US, and across the West, with DNA, making them the first K-pop group to truly conquer the North American market. The following year, in 2018, BLACKPINK also achieved success in the west with DDDD, which brought even more attention to K-pop from western audiences.\n\nIn 2018, the fourth generation of K-pop began and this generation, like any other, was strongly influenced by the previous generation, and this can be clearly seen by the directions that the K-pop market took from 2018 onwards. Korea and China, we saw a decrease in the number of Chinese idols, while with the increase of interest in K-pop in Japan and the West, we saw an increase in Japanese idols and English-speaking idols.\n\nFrom then on, we had an ever-increasing growth of K-pop on the global stage, especially during the pandemic years, but which remains firm until today. Now in 2023 the market value of the main K-pop companies (HYBE, JYP, SM, YG) combined have increased considerably compared to last year. And, not randomly, the two companies with the best performance today are HYBE and JYP, which are the two companies that invest the most in content for Japan and the US, which are the two largest music markets in the world today.\n\nMy point is: just as K-pop's withdrawal from the Chinese market is due to the political withdrawal from China and Korea, I believe that the strength of K-pop currently in the Japanese and American market directly reflects the political rapprochement between Japan. , Korea and USA. Japan and South Korea have a history of political friction that dates back to the beginning of the last century, as a result of the process of colonization of imperial Japan over Korea. But despite the historic conflict, currently the relationship between the countries is more peaceful, largely because of the relationship that both countries have with the US. After World War II, both Japan and Korea  were occupied by the USA, much of the American musical influence on Korean and Japanese music comes from that period as well. And in recent years both Japan and Korea have strengthened their political relations with the US and also with each other. And I believe this is reflected in the rapprochement of Asian popular culture with North American popular culture that has happened in recent years, especially in relation to Korean culture.\n\nSince the beginning of the decade we have had the first South Korean film to win an Oscar, BTS being the first Korean group to be nominated for a grammy, the most watched series on Netflix, Round 6 being a South Korean series. In addition to K-pop as a whole having gained more space in the American market in recent years, with several K-pop groups participating in music festivals in the country, signing contracts with American record companies, etc.\n\nI would like to know your opinion now, do you think that the rapprochement between the USA, Japan and Korea is related to the strengthening of K-pop in the two biggest music markets in the world? Is all information in my text correct? If not, could you tell me where I went wrong?",

            "comment": "Just a small correction\n\n&gt;After World War II, both Japan and China were occupied by the USA\n\nI think you mean Japan and Korea. After WWII China was still occupied by Japanese soldiers which is one of the reasons the Chinese people got pissed with the KMT and sided with the CCP, since the KMT\u2019s organization was too weak to swiftly kick the Japanese occupiers out (even though the Japanese had already surrendered at that point). The KMT was also aligned with the US and receiving US aide but then the civil was broke out between the KMT &amp; CCP, and once the KMT fled to Taiwan and the PRC took over it was like, fuck off USA lol.\n\nAnyway, I used to watch all types of Asian dramas before they got popular in the US, but out of all the cdramas, t-dramas, j-dramas, and k-dramas\u2026culturally, the humor/comedy from kdramas and kvariety was just more hilarious and relatable to me as an American. \n\nI also just realize your post does not really highlight the milestones Japanese entertainment culture has made in the US. Japan\u2019s major cultural export strength is anime. From Power Rangers to Pok\u00e9mon to the Studio Ghibli movies (of which one has won an Oscar before as well), Japanese anime/manga have already integrated themselves in American pop culture for decades. Maybe that\u2019s why you don\u2019t feel or notice its impact as much in recent years. But I grew up watching (badly dubbed) Sailor Moon &amp; Pok\u00e9mon air new episodes on public tv waves in the 90s, Japanese anime has always been in my life as an Asian American kid.\n\nA lot of the leak of Asian pop culture into the western market also just has to do with availability. Japanese anime and manga was made available to American markets through official and unofficial (fansub/fan translation) channels. BTS in part got popular in the US &amp; won their first award (a social media award) in the US because the boys made themselves available to international fans through social media (twitter). If China made their content easy to access in the US I\u2019m sure they could experience some sort of boost in the western market as well. But their country is too stubborn. Lots of cdramas are popular among the older white women I know who watch these on Netflix. There\u2019s an audience for Chinese media content (even films like Crouching Tiger have won major American awards; Jackie Chan is a major chunk of many American people\u2019s comedy film experiences before he became a PRC shill) but China is unwilling to let their entertainers out of their country\u2019s social censorship net.",

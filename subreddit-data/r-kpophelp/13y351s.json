    "postText": "I\u2019m thinking of this song from a boy group and I \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d it\u2019s been days it\u2019s bugging me. The song has these sort of long drawn out words, I can\u2019t remember the beat or anything else. usually these ear worms last an hour but this has been days ): the song goes something like\n\n\u2026. red oceannnn \u2026\u2026 emotionnnnn\n\nmaybe the first lyrics is like swimming into a red oceannnnn \n\nsomething like that ! i think it\u2019s an nct song , maybe taeyong verse? i know it is definitely a boy group \n\nEven a song with the words red ocean would help, thanks!",

Bang Chan sings at 1:32, \"Ride like the motions of the ocean, high tide in the moonlight, one way emotion, satisfaction...\"\n\nOcean and emotion. It has those words. I think I should go back to sleep lol",

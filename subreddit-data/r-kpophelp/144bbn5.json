    "postText": "Now when I say tame, I don't want people to think it should be a wild jungle with people pushing and shoving. But one of the things I enjoy most about going to a concert is feeling the music vibrate through my body and dance. At any western concert I've been to, big or small people are always up vibing and dancing, even if it's just swaying. It adds to the experience in my opinion.\n\nI've been to 3 kpop concerts now and they are just so boring (for lack of better word). No I don't mean that the performances sucked, they were all great but the crowd and atmosphere was so boring. Everyone was sat and just waving their lightsticks or recording the whole time. Sometimes no one even claps.\n\nIs it always like this?\n\nEdit:fixed typo",

            "comment": "Where have you attended the concerts?  Concerts in Korea and Japan are known for being \"tame\" because of the fan culture there.  It's practically an unwritten rule that all you do is sit there, wave your lightstick, and scream the fanchants.  From videos I have seen of concerts in America and other countries, people seem to have lots of fun jumping and screaming along to the lyrics and having fun interactions with the idols.  I'd say it would also depend on the group that's performing, since some groups are known for being good at hyping up the crowd and performing really exciting songs.",

And if you were in the west, were you close to the stage or were you in an upper bowl?\n\nIn Korea and Japan it\u2019s considered good concert etiquette to be seated and to make cheers between songs and for fan chants. It isn\u2019t boring, it\u2019s people being polite.\n\nIn the West, it\u2019s going to be more lively the closer you are to the stage.",

Unfortunately I wasn't able to get any close seats for the kpop ones but for any western artists, there have been times I was standing near the front, and also all the way to upper levels of arenas, doesn't matter where I was for any of the many concerts I've attended, everyone is always up and dancing with occasional breaks during slow songs or chit chat.\n\nFor kpop, I went to a standing venue for GIDLE, I think only people standing in the front on the floor did anything. I was upstairs and downstairs, there were times people literally didn't clap when a song was over, just busy recording.\n\nThen an ITZY one, they were probably the closest to western audience vibe so it wasn't as bad if I think about it.\n\nMost recent was a Mamamoo one. Literally no one in my section stood, I was ready to stand once they started and I'm not joking when I say, no one stood. The section next to mine there were a few but on the other side, no one also stood. And they are masters of performing so...\n\nJust wanted to see if anyone else who's attended western and kpop concerts also had the experience or I've just been unlucky.",

Also, with concerts that have multiple acts as not every person there knows or stans each group that is performing the enthusiasm exhibited per each performance will most likely vary.

The concepts of each group also make for a different crowd- a cute concept group like Twice probably have a less wild crowd as the music doesn\u2019t exactly prompt things like screaming/wildly dancing, more hip-hop or girl/boy crush concepts will most likely have a much louder crowd as the music in general is louder (NCT and SKZ with their noise music is insane LOL).",

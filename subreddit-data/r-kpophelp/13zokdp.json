    "postText": "So I got the new 5 Star album and once I opened my poster, I immediately noticed a blemish on it. It wasn't me. So how can I fix it do I talk to the retailer or just accept it? \n\n*SORRY I've never bought an album before, so I don't know protocol.*",

But if it's a really big issue like heavily damaged product or misprint or something, then it would be best to reach out to the retailer and see if you can get a replacement.",

Did you buy it in a physical store? A lot of times people don\u2019t want their posters and you may be able to get a replacement poster",

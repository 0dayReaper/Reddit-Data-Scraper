Which group are you seeing?\n\nTypically, your ticket will have info about the show time (when it starts) and the doors open time (when you can go inside the venue). I usually get there right around when doors open, but if it\u2019s general admission/pit and you want to be at the front, you might want to get there earlier. Usually, soundcheck is only available as a VIP perk or an add-on. But again, that info should be on the ticket or on the ticketing website! Have fun!",

            "comment": "1. Depends on the group and your ticket. In my experience (I'm in the US and K-pop concerts here are so disorganized no matter who handles it and when), if your ticket is GA PIT or standing and you want to be up at the very front, some people line up the literal night before. If you have assigned seats, you can come at least 30 minutes to an hour before, depending if you want to buy merch before the show or if you're not sure of how the lines are handled.\n2. Usually, VIP tickets include a sound check benefit. Check your ticket if it includes that perk. And no, not everyone is allowed to WATCH the sound check, especially if your ticket doesn't include it. However, more often than not, you can HEAR it going on even from standing outside the venue.",

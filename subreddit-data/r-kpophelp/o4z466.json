                            "comment": "I don't know if I have enough karma to even post here, but I have so many things to say about Shinwon!\n\nI think Yuto doesn't really fit what the OP's talking about. The aegyo part of idol life is difficult for him because he's introverted, but he works so hard on dancing, composing, mastering Korean, etc. I think being an idol was and still is his dream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShinwon, on the other hand, totally fell into being an idol and has a unique story that I think is worth sharing. (Paparoach\\_Approach, sorry if this is all stuff you know, I'm more explaining for people who don't know Pentagon)\n\n**tldr** Shinwon didn't debut because he wanted to be an idol, he debuted because he loves other Pentagon members and wanted to stay with them. At this point in his career, I think he's figured out how to enjoy being an idol in a way that feels authentic to him.\n\nOn to the long version haha. So, Shinwon originally moved to Seoul from the countryside without a clear goal in his mind. His \"dream\" was to be independent and make his own life in Seoul, maybe try some modeling. He got scouted by Cube while working at an EXO popup cafe (where he went viral for being a hot part-timer) and wasn't that interested in being an idol. They kept pursuing him though, and he thought doing the trainee thing for a bit would be an interesting life experience so he just gave it a shot, never expecting to debut. But he grew very attached to the other guys in Pentagon along the way. (He even said one member, Yanan, was his \"reason for living\" for a while)\n\nFor various complicated reasons, Shinwon was temporarily cut from Pentagon right before their debut. The company kept him as a trainee but didn't let him practice with the other guys anymore. He said he was devastated and often ended up crying in the corner of the practice room alone. If they wouldn't let him join Pentagon, he was planning to give up on everything and just move back to his hometown and/or go into the military. Luckily (again, for various complicated reasons) he did make it into the group!\n\nShinwon did have some bumps along the road after that though. He had a bit of an identity crisis in 2018, feeling like he wasn't contributing enough to the team and that he wasn't meant to be there because being an idol wasn't his dream. Hui (Pentagon's leader who also produces a ton of their songs) told Shinwon to come work with him in the studio and try writing a song to see if that gave Shinwon some clarity. Out of that came the friendship anthem Just Do It Yo, a really beloved song for Pentagon fans. It's basically about the good memories Pentagon members have had together, and Shinwon realized through writing it that his real dream is to help his friends achieve *their* dreams. It also seems like he enjoyed the writing process, and he often asks Hui or Kino (another member who produces a lot of songs) to teach him about composing.\n\nIn recent years, I think Shinwon has found his place and enjoys being an idol. He takes great care of the other members and gets emotional about them (although I think that's always been true). He's been learning guitar and said that he's fallen in love with music now. It's also obvious that he has fun communicating with fans. He does more Vlives than anyone else and posts a ton on Cube's fan communication app. He's not \"fanservicey\" at all, but he talks to Universe (Pentagon fans) in this really affectionate and casual way, like actual friends. So yeah, I think being an idol is partially just a job for Shinwon, but not in the sense that it's a burden or he wants to quit. At this point, he knows how to be an idol in a way that feels meaningful/authentic to him and it's been so cool to watch him truly find his place.\n\nIf anyone read this far, I love and respect you \ud83d\ude05 There's also an amazing guide to Shinwon [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeTlzBAi-mM&amp;t=3s) that includes a lot of clips of him talking about this stuff toward the beginning.",

He offers quite a bit of fanservice, and fan videocalls I\u2019ve seen with him, he seems engaged and happy to talk to fans. \n\nFrom the interviews I\u2019ve seen, I don\u2019t feel he is sulking, he is just an introverted person in a group where half the members are very extroverted. \n\nHe\u2019s also mentioned that it\u2019s important for his group to show their \u201cflavor\u201d in interviews, to differentiate themselves from other groups. So I think I.M\u2019s blase attitude in English interviews is partly to emphasize how they differ from other groups.

Being an idol was just a way to hang out with his friends and earn money, and he had a lot of issues with idol life (he\u2019s had a lot of problems with antis). Outside of working as an idol, Jaehyo is a professional fisherman (if your fave likes fishing, they\u2019ve probably done so with him), a farmer (he owns and tends his own farm in his free time), a photographer (he loves to do it and has had a showcase in the past, and has hinted at having another soon), a competitive gamer (he entered competitive gaming tournaments *while* block b was active-), a cook, a model (though he seems to only do fishing brands now, which is fun and cute), and the list honestly goes on. He has tons of hobbies. Since Block B is on hiatus, Bees have been delighted to see him engaging in his own hobbies more and more.\n\nLike I said, he still loves and appreciates his fans and actively hangs out with the members (him and Taeil seem to hang out a lot, and we think he may have seen Kyung recently?), but idol life is definitely just a job for him and he uses it to fund things he really wants to do.",

In the first years of BTS, you could really feel that he was just doing it as a job. But in the later years to now, he seems like he's accepted it and has \"grown\" into the idol/performer role.",

He has mentioned everytime that originally he auditioned with the intention of just making music or rapping but somehow he got as you said roped in bangtan (and arent we thankful!) Im guessing initially hes like nope but since he seems like a pragmatic person and he was struggling financialy he caved in, thinking also that as long he was able to make music w/c he loves the most he'll be fine. What I find funny is how he dodges idol-y things he doesnt want to do like there was one time they had to do the infamous(and I believe dreaded) kiss and blow card game for an interview and he faked coughing so it seems like they lost before theye even started the sense of relief from the members were palpable when he did that lol. I like how ofc he didnt plan for all of this to happen and he didnt dream to be an idol but hes clearly thankful for it, he never seems to be above it. Clearly I love Min Yoongi very much and I can go on and on but yeah to summarize theres that lol",

If they had waited a few months they would have probably had about 3 more songs on there and tbh I expect a repackage of WAW before the end of the year due to it's smaller than average size. It's important to note that the average Mamamoo release is actually 5 or 6 songs and of their EPs only Yellow Flower and Memory have more than 6 songs. Mamamoo's LPs are Melting and Reality in Black and I don't expect another full album before 2022. \n\nI feel like people are projecting their own dissatisfaction with what happened with Wheein onto Wheein herself and Mamamoo. I would suggest you watch the behind the scenes story of REDD, as discussed by Wheein herself and Park Woo Sang, because it shows that there was a lot of frustration and disappointment with the creative process behind REDD. Here's [Part 1](https://youtu.be/pXkCuzUUTbc) and [Part 2](https://youtu.be/vMtbK0aA0Bs). Wheein didn't just randomly decide to leave RBW and this comeback had nothing to do with her decision. \n\nI don't want to seem rude but I need to ask how big of a Mamamoo fan you are. Because they've delivered a lot of content for WAW and almost none of it was as you described. Fancams are just one aspect. Did you see the VLives where they were all laughing and having a good time? MMMTV? Solarsido? The 3 part reality series that just started?",

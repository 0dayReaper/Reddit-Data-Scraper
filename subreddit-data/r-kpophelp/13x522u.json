            "comment": "I used to only purchase through them because their shipping options were cheaper than having albums shipped to me directly from Korea. Usually albums took about 3 weeks for me to receive from the release date. I only had issue with them when I ordered black pink dolls from them. I think they ran out but still kept my order in limbo for three months. I finally did receive it, but I never had that kind of issue with albums.",

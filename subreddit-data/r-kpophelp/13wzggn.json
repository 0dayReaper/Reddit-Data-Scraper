    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m doing my dissertation and I need you to answer some quiz questions about KPOP and Blackpink. I need a minimum of 300 answers, so please, if you can send them to friends who like this music genre I would appreciate it. And if those friends pass it on to others even better, I need to have a wide network of the target audience for this questionnaire. I would appreciate it a lot. I have 3 weeks to collect the answers, so maximum diffusion please&lt;3. There is a control answer (type mark this answer), if it is not done correctly your answer will not be useful. Thank you very much for your attention and patience. It takes about 12 minutes to answer, if you have any doubts please let me know before sending the questionnaire so that I can count your answer. Thank you very much!&lt;3\r  \n\r  \nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe\\_8NxaFqO9eOctkfi33OjMhsblro\\_5nh\\_lKPPForJhRja88Q/viewform?usp=sf\\_link",

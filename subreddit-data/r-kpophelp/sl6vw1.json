I have worked with The Boyz, SF9, Infinite, and EXO when they toured Asia back then (of course separate occasions) and I can share some fun and interesting anecdotes if you want.\n\nPlease share some of yours too if you have any experiences.\n\nEDIT: OMG thank you so much for all the upvotes. I do appreciate everything. I forgot I also worked during Wanna One's very first fan meeting!",

            "comment": "I know we love our idols. But when working behind the scenes, I have HUGE appreciation for the staff and crew. They work so hard to build the sets for DAYS and have everything in order so the performers can SHINE. I worked at Bigbang ALIVE concert in our country. The crew came in one week before the performers. \n\nThe main guy, stage manager, is this long hair intimidating look dude, but is the kindest friendliest person who takes care of EVERYTHING to make empty space to Kings' Court. He was upset when some local helps received crew tshirts, but some didn't, like me! And he gave us tour stickers. I still have it on my luggage.\n\nWhen bigbang came in like a day before the show, I heard him say, \"the boys are in good mood. They have high energy.\" Like weather forecast.lol As expected, during sound check, GD took the lead, but all of them were confident and responsible of their own role on stage. They even walked around the venue to get a feel from the audience perspective. \n\nI was assigned to the camera director, so was working at the main console. The main creative director was a female. There's a lot of wait time and I remember them talking about how Infinite had a great concert. \nOn second day, Seungri came out to play DJ on the sound board, walked around the venue and talked to the staff he knows. I know he's hated now, but having seen him in person in his younger days, just makes me sad now more than anything else.\n\nThis was actually the 2nd time time I worked with bigbang performing. The 1st time was a festival with FT Island, missA, 2NE1 etc. I was actually assigned to 2NE1. CL is really charismatic. Minzy was really just a kid. Taeyang always has the highest energy level even backstage. The first time, I was lucky to get a hug from him. Me and another local runner, were just casually standing outside their green room. We were tasked to make sure TY and SR get to the airport immediately first after show ends, and sweaty Taeyang was still so hyped from the show, he hugged us and kept saying thank you. SR stood behind and kept bowing. I will keep sharing this story even when I'm in hell. Lol\n\nI was tasked to ask GD who forgot his key and was waiting for rescue outside his hotel room if he wanted supper. This was early days of kpop in 2011 before he was surrounded by bodyguards. He casually and politely rejected. \n\nThere're a few small stories from other artists because I used to work in events back in the day, but bigbang will always be my #1 because I have Taeyang\u2019s DNA in my skin now. Haha",

I was allowed backstage for a Block B show, pre HER era. \nMy only direct interaction with any of the band members came about because of a dog. One of the booking company\u2019s staff has a dog that hangs around backstage at the facility most days. Two of the band members- Taeil definitely and U-Kwon iirc - were particularly taken with her and spent a lot of time sitting in the hallway beside her. At one point, Family Member, myself and I THINK the boys\u2019 manager popped into an office to clear the hallway. The dog follows to the doorway, as does one of the band members (it was either U-Kwon or B-Bomb please don\u2019t come after me, their stage names rhyme.) I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m in the twilight zone at this point, when the manager(?) asks whether I have listened to the band before. I said yes, even though it was only once and on the way to the show, and U-Kwon(???) looked up from the dog and asked if I knew his name. I totally didn\u2019t LMFAO, but instead of being able to say that I just looked at him and made a stupid throat noise (thanks anxiety.) He laughed but it seemed to be in good fun.\n\nI watched from down the hall when they filmed a video intro/show announcement seven times, same script but varying reactions and levels of energy. Puts into perspective how heavily produced and vetted the material that was being released was, at least during that time period. \n\nI\u2019d like to add that their hair and and makeup artists were really really sweet. Here I was, sweat shorts and greasy hair, and they took the time to sit beside me and chat. These girls work with some of the most beautiful and talented artists in the entertainment industry but were still so humble and open with the random teenaged girl they found in the hallway.",

Taeil just likes animals, too. During the filming of HER, Taeil apparently kept trying to convince the ostrich\u2019s handler to allow him to pet and/or ride the ostrich. He was not allowed. \n\nIn that era in particular (not sure if it was Nillili Mambo, Very Good or Jackpot, but likely Very Good era considering Jackpot\u2019s timing and Nillili Mambo\u2019s Shit budget), they were still being *very* cautious with how they presented onscreen due to worries about the lasting effects of their previous controversy and their company lawsuit.

I was looking forward to see Yixing too but it was the time when he stopped attending concerts with EXO so yeah.\n\nAnyway, with the three:\n\nSehun -- MASSIVE. Like in height, he's very towering and I remember always looking up to him whenever he's in the room. He's also very handsome, but he didn't interact much with the people because he looked tired. Of course I didn't appproach him unless he asks me to, but yes he's very kind.\n\nChanyeol -- the life of the party. He's very tall too and the eyes are no joke, they're expressive af. He smiles to everyone and high fives the managers a lot (I think it's to keep the mood alive). He eats a lot too. I remember him finishing a whole box of pizza all by himself at the after party.\n\nSuho -- sis, he's a work of art. He's the one with the best English skills so he's trying his best to talk to people especially when they asked my friend about the meaning of the banners the fans were holding. The national fanclub left a bunch of banners along with the welcome snacks in the waiting rooms and he asked my friend about those. He's very amiable and I can see why he's the leader for a reason.\n\nI'm not saying the others are ugly but they're also handsome and sexy (Kai).",

My bestfriend worked more closely with the members, she had to go to the airport to welcome them and then to their hotel.\n\nThese are our conclusions:\n\n- Seungho and G.O were really nice to everyone. They would ask you for your name and joke around.\n\n- Thunder is very quiet\n\n- Joon wasnt in a good mood and you could tell he was over it/very exhausted. He kept to himself, staying in his hotel room the whole time (they all had separate rooms)\n\n- Mir didnt leave a good impression. He was always on his phone and wouldnt care about seeing fans outside the venue/the hotel but he would still tweet loving words. It all felt very fake",

They're not there to please everyone backstage so yeah.\n\nInseong was fun. I remember bringing them towels and I was running backstage to deliver the towels and then I bumped into someone, and I fell on the floor. It was Inseong and he was also running towards the stage because of the rehearsals, and he was about to help me stand up and I frantically said \"No, please go\" because they're in a pinch with time issues (Rowoon came late because of schedules so they had to do one more round) and kinda shooed him (but it's not me being rude, I just don't want to hold him up) and he ran away. After the concert, he saw me fixing the waiting rooms and he asked me about my fall and I said I'm fine. He said sorry but I said it's okay, and didn't talk much because the manager was there. You know, no pleasantries and only professional small talk.\n\nJaeyoon looked tired but he's very professional too.",

The first time he asked me was where he can smoke in the airport (I told him that was risky so I recommended him to smoke at the venue's smoking area). He asked me if it's okay to speak in Korean and thankfully, we understood each other. I was basically his entertainment since no one would approach him when he arrived at the venue, except for Zuho who also asked me where to smoke lol\n\nHe was very professional in terms of the performances even though he keeps on missing steps (he was very tired y'all).\n\nI can see the sadness and exhaustion in his eyes and the members were not helping too, so I really think it's deeper between him and the other boys. He has his own manager and a small staff, like a stylist, a hair and makeup person, and another person, and they're all nice too. I was lucky to bring home Rowoon's concert shirt (he quickly changed to his shirt after the concert and gave it to me, he even told me not to sell it lol) and then he swiftly left for Korea.\n\nI would love to meet him again soon! I hope he's much better.",

A couple of members were yelling at him and Rowoon was over it. I know Korean decently so I understood their side comments about him and I was very confused as to why this is happening. They were also mean to him when he was not doing well during the rehearsals (one of the members shouted at him to get it right and Rowoon yelled back at him).\n\nAfter the concert, I asked around my friends in the concert scene and they said that everything started like that when Rowoon was getting more and more exposure compared to other members.

I felt sad for Rowoon because he's never had a break and the others are just like this. I heard some staff talking about how \uc624\ubc14 the members are when they're enjoying cuts off Rowoon's individual activities. I dunno if that's true but if it is, I just want him to leave the group and join an acting agency. When the news that Hwiyoung talked to everyone about re-signing as SF9, I already knew it was press release. Hwiyoung didn't even acknowledge him offstage but he was different onstage. So yeah.",

I have so many anecdotes but I will share some that I can remember:\n\nWhen they're in Manila, the fans wrote a letter and showed it on a video as a surprise. All of them were genuinely cracked and I am the one who wrote that letter (as I am also a huge fan and worked for the national fan club), and they're really asking people (us) about the letter and who wrote it and stuff. When I told them I did it, they're very flattered and Eric thanked me three times for that. Jacob said that the fans didn't have to do that but I told him that it was a pleasure to be their representative.\n\nI also bought them the chicken they're eating when they were having that live after the concert. I remember buying 15 buckets of chicken, ten boxes of pizza, five tubs of spaghetti, and 50 servings of mango and banana shakes for them to eat after the concert. It was all wiped out in half an hour (no exaggeration).\n\nWe also gave them cereals and some munchies (like the Filipino snacks Kevin showed in the room) and Jacob loved the chocolate cake with fillings inside that he filled his pockets with those when they were leaving the airport.",

He's like the members' rep to the staff whenever they need anything and he's a smoking buddy to his smoker members (tho dunno if he also smokes). Very professional and his body is indeed gorgeous! Not to be pervy but the clothes fit him so well. He's also tall and he remembers the fans' names. Calling them by their name during high touch events.",

Very kind, I met them back when they were rookies and you really could tell in the way they didn\u2019t know what to do with themselves when they were off camera. Incredibly endearingly awkward, but still very sweet. During a section where they were filming a message the take had to be scrapped because Mingi messed it up and Hongjoong blushed bright red, hid his face in seonghwa\u2019s shoulder and in the tiniest voice went \u201cI\u2019m SHY\u201d and it was the cutest thing i\u2019ve ever seen. \n\n- P1harmony were all very good kids, according to my friend who was their US manager when they came. However he did say Soul was the weirdest child he\u2019s ever met. Like he couldn\u2019t describe what exactly about him was weird, he was just an incredibly strange dude. my friend couldn\u2019t for the life of him figure out what Soul was thinking at any time. \n\n- A friend of mine was in seoul for a bigbang concert and splurged for the money to stay at G-Dragon\u2019s parents rental. So she went and his parents were very sweet and gave her the tour, and then said dinner was ready so she was eating with them and GD walked in and sat down to eat too. Apparently he frequently stays with his parents before a concert, so she chatted with him for a while and he was very polite and kind. She mentioned she liked his perfume so he just gave her the bottle, then went up to his room and went to sleep lol. \n\n- My best friend once almost ran over a golcha member with a car \n\n- During the US leg of the superm tour, Baekhyun had to use a stage jumper thing that launched him out of the stage, but he was pretty nervous about it (it\u2019s called the toaster) since the one in LA was pretty different then the usual ones. So my friend has to teach him how to use the toaster, and apparently baekhyun spent the whole lesson following him around like a lost puppy trying to learn how to not fall on his ass when he gets launched out. My friend has only good things to say about Baekhyun.\n\nthere are a few negative stories, but I don\u2019t really like to tell them because they all come from moments of high tension or stress and I don\u2019t think they really reflect the person well enough to put it out there. Kpop stans, yk?",

Did your friend hop out and apologize? (No hate on them I have had my fair share of driving scares, just curious about the interaction!)\n\nAlso that GD story is legendary oh my god",

They were driving backstage at Kcon and the kid jumped out of his van directly into the road. My friend slammed on the breaks, obviously, but still would have hit the kid if the leader\u2019s hand didn\u2019t shoot out, grab the kid by the back of his hoodie and physically yank him backwards into the car.

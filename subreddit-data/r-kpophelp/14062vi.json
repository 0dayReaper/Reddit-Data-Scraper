            "comment": "**TEMPEST** and **ZEROBASEONE** has some similarities. \n\n\u2022 **The Iconic Kim Taerae\u2019s -** It\u2019s just fascinating how two out of three Kim Taerae\u2019s who were born on the year 2002 debuted as an idol and met on the same stage during 2023 KCON Japan. It is indeed a history made in KPOP.\n\n\u2022 **The Hanbins -** Aside from having two Kim Taerae\u2019s, we also have the Hanbin\u2019s in both TEMPEST and ZB1. TEMPEST\u2019s Hanbin and ZB1\u2019s Hanbin also had the chance to meet during KCON.\n\n\u2022 **Zhang Hao and LEW -** I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the only one, but after seeing Zhang Hao in Boys Planet, I got major LEW vibes. In my opinion, they kind of look a like, and give off leader vibes. They\u2019re both from Yuehua too, and maybe trained together for quite some time. \n\n\u2022 **Ricky and Hwarang -** Just like Hao and LEW, Ricky gives me Hwarang vibes, and I know I\u2019m not the only one since I saw lots of edits on TikTok that pointed out the same thing. They also look kind of the same for me lol\n\nNot really similarities but more on a connection between the two groups: \n\n\u2022 **Yuehuaz -** ZB1 basically consists of 4 out 5 members that are under Yuehua, the same company that handles TEMPEST. Hyuk mentioned that the Yuehuaz are really close to them, with Hyuk being friends with Gyuvin prior joining the company. Aside from that, Yuehuaz were also spotted attending TEMPEST\u2019s comeback show last year.",

Rankings is a bit of a redundant activity during this \"transitional phase\" of rising 4th gen popularity, imo. \n\nRed Velvet have always had variable charting success, so no, they haven't dropped off. \nRBB and Bad Boy released in the same year, same as ZZB and Psycho and now the same as FMR and Birthday. Red Velvet are no strangers to putting out a chart \"flop\" and bouncing right back with a hit.",

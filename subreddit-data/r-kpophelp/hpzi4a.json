I've been fan for 8 years I'm living my life as a silent and don't have friends fan. Thanks to K-pop they are the reason why I'm happy (even I'm a literally silent fan who don't interact with my fellow fan). As long as I'm updated and watch their contents in K-pop groups that I stan I'm happy with it. \n.\nIs anybody have a same situation like me?",

Also I don't like having too much social media so I don't have Facebook or Twitter to interact with (I'd rather not be a part of the crazy part of Twitter lol).\n\n Reddit has helped though, like this post and thread \ud83d\ude0a\n\n\nEDIT: we have created a new Discord.

Conversations are live but it's also organized into different channels (so kinda like subs in reddit). The good twitter content also gets handpicked/filtered out because discord members tend to share the good ones on the server anyway. Joining a smaller discord is better for conversations but joining a big one is good for getting the updates. I really recommend it for anything even for your other hobbies (if you could find a server of it)",

But we talk about EXO (the group we grew up with) \n\nI dont have a kpopfriend , I used to go on kpopmeetings, talk to them and meet with them again but...they are just too cringe and hardcore for me. I also had a small group but again they were super hatefull(they talked more about the idols they hate). I stopped to try to have kpop friends\n\nI wish I had a small group of fan friends who were chill like me :( I'm kinda tired of being a silet fan, would be nice to do covers and watch korean shows together T.T",

I have this army friend that had no Idea Dark &amp; Wild even existed!!!! Like BRUH. From my observation, she only listens to popular BTS songs and says she's a multi stan while not knowing any of her \"other groups\" member names. I saw her watching some old popular Stray Kids MV and I said: \"OMG you're a stay?!?!? I'm a stay!!\" She said \"What's that? \" and I responded \"Oh. The group your watching's fandom name is Stay\". \"Oh. I'm a Stay then. I LOVE STRAY KIDS!!!My bias is Felix!!!\". I just guessed she was new, but then when I said that Changbin's rap was dope, she said \"Who's that??\". Still new I thought, but then I also noticed her kpop pins and asked her about them. She lowkey had no idea what I was talking about. She only knows popular kpop songs and didn't know who 2NE1 was until I told her lol. But that's okay. It's just I have nothing to talk about with her and my other friends. So, I became a silent fan.",

Although, i heavily follow Twice's content and their music, i could never consider myself a fan. (Idk if this makes sense tbh)\ud83d\ude02. Honestly though, being involved in the kpop world just for the tea and gossip is fun",

One day my seatmate brought an album of my ult group, them boom in an instant we became friends. From there I also started befriending her friends who also love kpop. Its actually fun talking to friends about kpop stiffs since it widens your perspective on a certain group. For example me as an older/longer fan, I get my friends to listen to older groups while them help me to get into newer groups. I never thought before that kpop will help me build friendship.\n\n\nThe right time will come for you to make friends. Just remember to be open to changes and everybody's opinion. You can also join kpop friendly communities because I also made online friends on that.",

I would love to make some online friends though!",

Then this one.\" etc. Or someone who similarly is a big fan of a group I'm not very familiar with, who would want to kinda guide me through getting to know them.\n\nBut yeah I don't have anyone to chat with about Kpop. Any gg fans in or around Seoul, but who also have other interests besides Kpop (I don't think long-term conversation can survive with only a single topic)?",

So it does get lonely but seeing there are so many of us like this we should create some sort of chat or discord for the silent kpop fans lol.",

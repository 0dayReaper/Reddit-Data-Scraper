Probably aespa or Red Velvet. It's got kind of a groovy beat. I think that this part comes some time after the chorus. I don't think this in the right key, but it might be. The part where the piano goes up is where the voice modulator kicks in. I think that the last word in the phrase is \"cheoreom.\" Please help if you can!",

                    "comment": "The tempo of the song itself would be faster than the recording! It's definitely not as melodic as \"In My Dreams\" or \"Welcome to My World.\" Honestly, it might not be even either of those groups. I don't remember any English words.\n\nI remember that the voice modulator for this specific part sounded pretty similar to the beginning of [\"Sorry Not Sorry\" by Demi Lovato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MsvER1dpjM) when she says that \"payback is a bad bitch\", and the overall vibe of the song was kind of like LOONA'S \"Butterfly\" chorus.",

I feel like I know this song though. Is the part of the song you recorded the chorus? \n- dumb dumb -red velvet \n- flip that - loona \n- dance the night away - twice",

It\u2019s not a very melodic song and was pretty beat-heavy. I\u2019ve been looking for it too this whole day so I appreciate you helping out TT",

Or maybe an act you're not super into but like enough to pay for tickets. \n\nOther than that, I've made a night of watching a playback of a full concert on YouTube or the like. Put out out some fun snacks and make a drink (alcohol or not, depending on if you drink or not) and have a concert all on your lonesome. I love having a solo concert in my living room now and again.",

Focus on enjoying the content that's out. You may be able to get a DVD of the concert! Or it might be posted online.

Especially in this post Covid and ticketmaster allowed to do whatever they want  world.    Kpop tickets are so unreal. I\u2019m so glad other music I listen to isn\u2019t just top 40 music.  \n\n\nIf you\u2019re able to get your important stuff done that day, you could always check our stub hub or ticketmaster late in the day to see if there\u2019s anything left.    I was told by a lot of people on here not to have FOMO and wait til the concert was closer and resale prices would drop.  But then me and my friend were doing that for Blink 182 and she said the prices went up the day of the concert.   So I don\u2019t know.  \n\nI\u2019ve had to miss a few concerts because of things.  Ok I can really only think of one off the top of my head because there was a major snow storm so my mom wouldn\u2019t let me go cause it was 2 hours away (but of course I knew other people going and they all want so that sucked).   Eventually you\u2019ll be \u201cover it\u201d, I was lucky enough it was a group that tours more and comes around more. Then I missed their goodbye tour because I was in Disney when he was in Canada (this is all panic at the disco lol) and at first I wasn\u2019t overly sad cause I didn\u2019t know it was gonna be a goodbye tour and I didn\u2019t/don\u2019t like the album.   But then he announced it part was three and I\u2019m like wtf!!      Like I said tho, eventually you\u2019ll be \u201cover it\u201d.",

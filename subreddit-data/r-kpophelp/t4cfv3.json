    "postText": "Hello, my name is Geo and recently, I got a lot of messages on Instagram saying that my work has been stolen by [NCT\\_Dream](https://www.instagram.com/p/CafC483BaDN/) and [SM Entertainment](https://www.instagram.com/p/CafEY00DxE4/) and posted as their teaser on their socials.\n\nAt first, I didn't really pay attention, but after doing a bit of research, SM is known in the art industry for stealing works of smaller creatives. I find it really unfair that such a massive company would do that and I'm not really sure what to do. I have been developing this style for over 2 years and have never seen people use that specific style.\n\nI have contacted them, the people who worked on it and the labels that will release these albums, including the artists that were victims in the past, but I haven't gotten a reply yet. Do you have any recommendations on how to best approach this situation without making a big deal out of it or hiring a lawyer?\n\nI have linked their socials and here are the examples of my work:   \n[My work - Example 1](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXXtsJpPQEn/)   \n[My work - Example 2](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSqrGCfNDjY/)   \n[My work - Example 3](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUb6Mz8NMml/)   \n[My work - Example 4](https://www.instagram.com/p/CYJSBIJvPrr/)   \n[My work - Example 5](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUl3odqAeYf/)   \n[My work - Example 6](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXXtsJpPQEn/)",

            "comment": "The first step is always identifying what your property is that you think has been infringed. Intellectual property is a property right, and at its most fundamental, a property right is the \"the right to exclude.\" Think about it - if you own a piece of land, your most fundamental right is to keep other people off of it.  \n\n\nSo I think the first thing you need to do is decide what you think is yours, and what you think you have a right to tell other people not to do. From there, you can focus your approach a bit better.  \n\n\nIf you think your design is \"morphing letters\" I'm not sure that is something that is highly protectable, as it isn't that distinctive or unique. I think you'd have trouble arguing that the idea of words that change their shape is something that only you can do as an idea. Even as a \"brand\" thought like a trademark, you would have to prove that an ordinary consumer would associate that design with you as the source - so someone would have to see that on NCT's instagram and think \"Ah, they must work with geojum, that is his/her style!\"  \n\n\nAdditionally, the two examples you posted show the color and font's morphing, whereas yours is more of a silhouette morph.  \n\n\nBUT - THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF ADVICE I CAN GIVE IS THAT NONE OF US FOOLS ON THE INTERNET CAN HELP YOU WITH THIS. We are NEVER going to be able to replace actually talking to a lawyer in real life. None of us are experts in the area, and there are very specific facts that will change the answer. Call around to lawyers (you could specifically look up \"IP\" or \"Trademark and Copyright\" lawyers to narrow it a bit) and tell them you created something, you think a major brand has infringed on it, and you'd like them to take a look. You should be able to find one who will give you a quick, free consultation to let you know if they think its worth going further on, and then you can decide your course of action from there.",

But I am currently in law school and have taken IP classes. \n\nI think you and the commenter above are getting a bit confused. The principle of likelihood of confusion (consumers being misled into believing that OP and SM are working together) only really applies to trademarks, which means OP would have had to use his art in commerce (selling/buying merch using it as a logo, for example). Copyright law is different and has more robust standards for similarities compared to trademarks. Imitations need to be almost identical in order to be a copyright violation, whereas trademark violations require that consumers be confused as to the origin of the product, even if the marks aren\u2019t particularly similar. OP\u2019s art is probably not trademarkable anyway since, as someone else mentioned, it\u2019s not quite distinct enough. \n\nI agree that if OP wants to pursue legal action they should contact an IP lawyer, and particularly an international one. International IP law gets complicated, and they might end up having to sue in Korea due to principles of comity and territoriality. Korea also likely has different national laws, and I\u2019m not sure if they are members of/have ratified international treaties like the Berne Convention (governing copyright) or the WTO, so international standards might not even apply to them. A lawyer would really help.",

You would need a lawyer that is versed in Korean law to provide you with realistic advice and expectations. A regular British lawyer isn\u2019t going to be able to help you gain any acknowledgment from a foreign company, most of us only know British, Irish and European law so prepare yourself for them to be wholly unhelpful either way\n\nThe main thing I\u2019ve picked up here is that you haven\u2019t mentioned in your post if you own the copyright or IP of this art style so I\u2019ll assume you don\u2019t - and that\u2019s what it\u2019ll come down to. You do not **own** this style of art, you didn\u2019t **invent** this type of art, therefore the only thing you can claim is that SM\u2019s art designers took inspiration from your work, which isn\u2019t theft or plagiarism. Even this would be a stretch to claim unless you can prove that an SM art designer was following your work and took direct inspiration (side by side parallels showing exactly which areas were taken from **your** work that nobody else has used)\n\nI\u2019m sorry to say all of this because your art clearly means a lot to you but I just want you to be prepared if you do seek legal advice. I\u2019m not a fully qualified lawyer and laws concerning copyright and IP are subject to change due to developments in technology and so my understanding may be outdated now, plus I\u2019m not well versed in Korean law, but just prepare yourself for this to go nowhere. Like most copyright and IP cases, there\u2019s too much grey area concerning \u201cideas\u201d and ownership of them to really nail this type of thing down",

(Sorry)\n\nThis is a very old school cartoon type of morph and just applying that to text is not something you can suddenly claim, just because you've been doing that too for 2 years straight.\n\nSM's teaser for NCT Dream is far from what you've made, besides morphing text.\nOnly if you were to own the fonts you use in your art, for example, and they used those. Then you'll might be able to make something out of it. But, they didn't use that at all, and they still changed it by using multiple fonts of which then again wouldn't be yours and are altered too much, so you wont be able to claim that as your work. \n\nA way to create stuff isn't something you can claim. Unless you've a ton of money and already bought the rights to it so no one else would be able to do it without asking you for permission. But then you're some wacky company that for some reason wants to have that specific monopoly and do more with that, and not a freelancer artist. \n\nI am suprised that now, after 2 years of work you are thinking this is how copyrights work. I would've assumed you'd have ran into such things before in the time you have been making your art. \n\nAnyways it's still important to know what do you own of your own art, so if I were you I would look into that. Especially also the rules and rights sites have, like Instagram, when you post it. Every country has it's own rules on these rights, but since you share it on the world wide web rules tend to be different.\nThere's a lot of rules no one cares to say or acknowledge, they just post, but they do exist and they can help you or have the opposite effect. So researching every aspect of your work from now on would help in not feeling like someone stole your works, or not feeling clueless when something like this happens again as well! \n\n\nSo on that note. I hope you feel not too bad about the situation you're in right now. But feel more comfortable in sharing your work without being scared of it being stolen or improperly used, thanks to all the help of these other comments!\nAnd good luck with future works! Hope you'll be happily making your art for years to come!",

Something I wish for all artists (graphic, music, or otherwise) is for them to have an a foundation on the structure of their industry and the rights that protect them. It can seem daunting and most artist/musicians I've worked with just aren't bothered to explore it. You don't need to go law degree deep in understanding, as there are professionals who can help you, but give yourself a slightly higher vantage point so you don't get blindsided when someone actually does infringe your work.",

The idea of having text morph to fill a screen, while visually cool, unfortunately is not original enough for it to be claimed by anyone, so it is highly likely for this to just be a coincidence. The designer's approach to the Glitch Mode animation (taking into account all the fonts, colors, visual styles, and even variety in morphing styles) is stylistically different enough for it to be their own concept. If it was a 1-to-1 copy to the examples you shared, I would say you're right, but in this case, I don't feel they're close enough to be considered plagiarism.",

Only way to reach the settlement is to put them under public pressure regardless of whether they actually legally infringed on your copyright or not.\n\nIf you decide to go down that route: post on instagram, contact kpop yt accounts, dm popular kpop twitter/instagram accounts and hope your claim gets traction. \n\nCAUTION: it's totally possible that you will be harassed by some NCT fans for years to come",

Unfortunately, while I know you want to avoid it becoming a big thing, unless a big fuss is made of it, SM likely will not bother to do right by you. \n\nIt usually takes a big backlash from fans for most of the Kpop companies to do anything. Past artists who were ripped off only had their issues resolved once fans got involved. \n\nI recommend posting that your art was stolen to various Kpop subreddits and possibly on other social media sites as well if you can.\n\nI'm sorry this happened to you.",

Not worth the time and money imo. \n\nUsing social media to bring attention to this could also backfire because to be frank, NCT dream probably has the most passionate and defensive fanbase out of the active SM groups \n\nIf anything, your work is super cool, and I hope you get more recognition and appreciation out of this!",

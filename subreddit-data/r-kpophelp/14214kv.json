It\u2019s in coursera I think it\u2019s called?- they have more than just Korean courses idek how to explain but I suggest looking into it :)",

Learn what you can at your own pace I guess?",

Another way I\u2019ve seen K-pop idols study Korean without a tutor or website yk things like that is their staff put words on the wall they have to memorize and the Korean alphabet to work on their pronunciation- idk how to explain but I suggest getting into this kind of thing if you\u2019re interested in learning Korean :) (it\u2019s also easier to watch Korean interviews without waiting for a translation- Korean is a context language and even if not fluent it\u2019s so easy to understand convos)",

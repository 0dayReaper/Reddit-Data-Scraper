While the song itself was great, swelling with emotion, and def a vibe I appreciate and return to often, it was this analysis from Form of Therapy\u2019s reaction that made the song memorable and haunting, those feelings of reserved euphoria holding to this day\n\nAnd in seeing OP\u2019s prompt this song and said feelings immediately came to mind",

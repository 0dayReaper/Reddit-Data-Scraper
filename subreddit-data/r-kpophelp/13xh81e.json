ZICO)\n\n[Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEoodSzqeIs) \\- CRUCiAL STAR\n\n[woo ah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CM5iC_isug) \\- Crush\n\n[fairy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax26wXCdQSA) \\- Dvwn\n\nOnlyOneOf has a lot more similar songs iirc. Some off the top of my head are [cOy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKEgcr5N-LQ), [time machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOY7HETMrE), and [desert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N37nj5xolJE).",

I have a double of a pc and I\u2019d really like to trade it but I have zero clue where to even start. I see unboxing videos on tik tok but never anything about how they found someone to trade with, how they initiate a trade, any lingo they might use, etc. I\u2019m completely at a loss lol, any help is great",

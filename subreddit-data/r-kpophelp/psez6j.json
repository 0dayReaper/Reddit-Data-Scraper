Suju and snsd are known to be absolute legends when it comes to variety, and exo are literally the bridge between gens (having debuted in 2012) so I think they were actually trained to be on variety. I do have to say it's a shame they rarely appear on variety and radio shows, especially the latter - they just bounce off each other so well!",

    "postText": "I ask as a non-US, non-North American fan, actually, what would it take for a song by a K-pop group to be played on American radio?\r  \nIn recent years, many large corporate groups have signed catwalkers in the US, especially HYBE and JYP, which are the companies most interested in working in the North American market. But even so, not a single song by any of that company's groups, except, of course, BTS, was played on radio in the country. On the other hand, Cupido's Fifty Fifty and XG's Left Right are being played on radio stations across the US.\r  \nSo I ask: what does it take for a song to be played on American radio? Does it just depend on the record label or the radio stations? Why are groups of small companies having their music played on the radio but groups from large companies, which have contracts with major record labels in the US, do not have their music broadcast on the radio?\r  \nAlso, if anyone can also answer, after all what is the role of American record companies for these K-pop groups? I ask because from the outside, there doesn't seem to be any difference between groups that are signed to American labels and those that aren't.",

I haven't heard Fifty Fifty or XG yet either, but Ik they're played in some areas.",

            "comment": "I live in the US and my aunt used to be a local DJ back in the day but the industry has really changed. \n\nPreviously, DJs used to actually take request and curate their own playlist. Now there are a lot if nationally syndicated shows where a corporate entity decides the playlist and sends it to stations taking out those unique preferences different DJs used to have.\n\nThis change in the industry is what breeds a lot of issues. It\u2019s basically become a pay for play system with some umbrella agencies like Columbia being known to go heavy on radio as a strategy. BTS was under Columbia with a distribution contract when they got their best radio numbers, which were still miles behind US mainstream acts \n\nAlso, if you noticed all the songs that got radio play were in English. It\u2019s also quite regional I\u2019m sure the 50/50 and XG plays are coming primarily out of California. I haven\u2019t heard them on the radio",

Now, I think there's an additional push from the record companies and/or the US affiliate companies sponsoring the airtime. I personally do not listen to the radio anymore so don't quote me on today's standards lmao.",

I live in a Midwestern town of about 100,000 people, so not the middle of nowhere, but not a huge city either. \n\nThe requirement (at least around here) basically seems to be:\n\n Entirely in English (with minimal and easily understood accents), and\n\nInsanely, hugely, globally, popular (outside of the just the kpop realm). They most likely need to be requested frequently, and/or need to be topping on some kind of chart/streaming service.",

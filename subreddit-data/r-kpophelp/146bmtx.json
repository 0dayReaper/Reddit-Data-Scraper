Both have their particular style but there are moments I confuse the two voices.  There is a live of \u201c1000 years by your side\u201d where you see them listening to each others voices and JJong harmonizing and supporting Onew  and visa versa.  \nWhen I hear Jinki\u2019s new work like \u201cCircles\u201d I feel some of the same feelings I do with JJong solo work.  I really just hope that Jinki recovers from whatever he is going through because it hurts my heart to know he is hurting.",

I went to the fanmeet in person and even if I knew I was so SHOCKED to hear how his voice resounded. Bro put his mic away yet we would still hear him crystal clear in the arena. Each time he hit a note it sounded like heaven. SHINee is terrific when it comes to voices and Jonghyun and Onew are next level.",

(I would also end up biasing Wow during the same MV, but Byeongkwan definitely had all my attention and was the reason I checked out A.C.E besides loving the song.)\n\nDami from Dreamcatcher: I got introduced to the group through their cover performance of BigBang's Bang Bang Bang. All I wanted to know was who the deep voiced rapper was, and now here I am not only biasing her but ulting the group as well haha.\n\nSoobin from TXT: Back during pre-debut before we knew what they sounded like and everything. I took one look at him and went \"it's him.\" (I would also end up biasing Huening Kai and Taehyun after debut, but it was always going to be Soobin from the start.)\n\nBut usually it's always a \"bias at first sight\" for me with groups when I see performances or MVs. I very rarely have to rewatch or see content/look at group socials, though it does happen occasionally. For example: I didn't have a bias in SF9 for a good while after getting into them, and the only two members I knew by name and face at the time were Inseong and Chani (Inseong for WeKpop and Chani for Show Music Core), but then Zuho had posted a pic of him with one of his cats (I believe it was Huru) and that was it for me.",

I biased Jin, Lee Know, I.M., S.Coups, and Johnny instantly, but most of my biases were members that I figured would be my favorite from the start and I just got pulled in deeper. Moonbyul, Dami, Jeno, and Leedo are there.\n\n(Did have a brief moment of thinking it would be Jaemin and Hwanwoong because they were the only other person seriously grabbing my interest in the MVs, but then my interest seriously veered in another direction when I started watching content.)\n\nI was pulled into TXT by Beomgyu, but now I truly can't decide between him and Soobin. Wooyoung was who got me into Ateez, but he's now my biaswrecker with Mingi as my bias.\n\nStill delving into GIDLE, but Soyeon is who I was first drawn to, but might be getting biaswrecked by Yuqi. You can clearly see my thing for deep voices. For WayV, still learning too but I was drawn to Hendery at first because I learned about how Lucas fucked him over and was furious on his behalf when I couldn't even pick him out of a line-up. Then I happily learned other reasons to watch him closely, and now I think only Yangyang comes close to overtaking him.\n\n(You can also clearly see my thing for rappers.)\n\nShinee is probably the most interesting one. Was sent mostly Taemin content by the friends wanting to get me into it and I loved his MVs, but was drawn to Onew in the background a lot of the compilations. Then started listening to them and Key's solo work drew me the most. But then started watching the MVs, and Minho grabbed my attention there! And he and Key both stand out in the variety content especially when they play off each other.\n\nAnd Jonghyun's talent and presence can't be denied, but I had to put my Shinee dive on hold when I was in a depressive episode and his letter hit too close to home. But God, it also made it clear I wasn't alone and my feelings weren't brand new, and that made me recommit to bettering my mental health and making changes in my life.\n\nFor Shinee, it's really hard to have a bias. I think they're definitely the group where if one of them has you, they all have you.",

And so on so forth.\n\nHowever, it happens pretty often for groups I'm only a casual listener of. Like I've listened to their discography, watched some mvs, but I'm not familiar with the members. So I tend to be more casual about picking a bias.\n\nFor example, BTS. The first song I listened to was Dope which was a long time ago. What I remember is that the member wearing the police(?) uniform is my bias. Cause that's what I decided. But I'm too lazy to go back and actually figure out who that was though.",

I overlapped our faces and yup....same facial proportions. After years it made sense why i liked him so much - he probably looked similar enough to me.

I had no idea who he was and I wasn't listening to Kpop at all. Heck I'm not even really into rap music but that voice and that ability and his vocal style drew me in. I shazamed the song and learned it was called Ride or Die by Joohoney and Kei. I googled Joohoney and learned his name is Lee Jooheon and that he is one of two rappers in a Kpop group called Monsta X. This was June 3rd 2021 and I know this because when I looked Monsta X up on YouTube, the Gambler video had released 2 days before. The Hero rooftop video was the first music video and song that I watched and listened to and I was so hooked that I  immediately used the link on the video page on YouTube to take me to Ticketmaster to buy two tickets for their concert in DC that at that time wasn't for another 8 or 9 months. Then of course it got postponed and I ended up exchanging one for VIP when some became available. I also ended up buying tickets to Fandominium and Gas South in Georgia the following year. All because of Lee Jooheon. I am hooked on Monsta X, and a big fan of Stray Kids, Onewe, ONEUS, OnlyOneOf, and Jackson Wang all because Lee Jooheon's talent, even before his looks, drew my attention to him, Monsta X and Kpop music in general.",

Seeing her on variety sealed the deal because she was so energetic and cute, then her facial expression fancams going viral just made me feel proud of my bias :')\n\nNewjeans' Haerin was also an instant bias when I saw her personality in their YT vids. I have a soft spot for shy and introverted idols, as someone who is quite shy, myself.\n\nEdit: Sakura, as well. I admire her in a similar way that I admire IU. She just comes across as remarkably hardworking, I like that she's a gamer, and I respect her status as an experienced idol already. So, when Le Sserafim debuted, I already had a bias and I haven't switched.",

    "postText": "Why do idols wear so many layers, especially when at dance practice?  In the behind the scenes videos, I see them dancing in long sleeves and sweatshirts and hats\u2026 it\u2019s so weird.  Are buildings kept colder there than in the US?  And on stage they always seem to have t-shirts and jackets and long pants, and it seems so uncomfortable, because I know those lights are so hot.  Thanks.",

They wear toques/hats to hide comeback hair changes. Skinny people are also more likely to have circulation issues in their hands/arms/feet/legs, which means they are cold more often and have difficulty generating heat.",

But she/he is actually implying that IU is not an idol because she makes her own music, when idols usually don't and they just sing what is given but he/she agrees that there are idols who also make music but not as often. How do you define an idol then? Why do you think IU is not an idol when IU herself said she's an idol. It's just that she also creates music. What is you basis on dismissing IU as an idol? Is it because you think 1 is greater than the other? IU is an idol and an artist.  Why could these words not apply to IU?",

If IU date someone is a lot less popular than her or someone with bad reputation or someone is as not good looking, it'll be another kind of hell (for example: Kim Yuna married to Ko Woo-rim, Lee Seunggi with his wife or when Yoo Hae Jin dated with Kim Hye Soo)",

Likewise, LJS is well-accomplished and has a very good reputation and supportive fans. There\u2019s really no reason to hate on them.

Doubt they're happy but it's IU's business in the end. The fandom is usually the problem in these situations so, doubt they're happy but ~ it passed~\n\nAs for the gp they eat up these stories so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

IU fans decided they were naked (except you couldn't see their bodies at all) and therefore sleeping together. Fans FREAKED OUT and treated Eunhyuk like a predator preying on an innocent maiden. I guess her fans have finally grown up and stopped being possessive of her.",

I was a bit surprised too, but compared to people in groups, solo artists have a more laid back fan base, the fans only really care about the artists\u2019 well being and the next comeback and such. It\u2019s like that with Sunmi and Chungha too, who are also really big solo artist in korea (Though I\u2019m pretty sure there would be an uproar if Chungha did date someone, now that I think about it). But along with that, IU and Jongsuk are both very well looked at in korea and their relationship to the public eye contains no flaws, as well as their reputation, so I think the main thought is from both fanbases is that \u201cthey\u2019re in good hands\u201d.",

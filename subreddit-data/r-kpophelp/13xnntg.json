Last comeback was pretty good!\n\nBlackpink has a more \"international\" approach to music, but they're amazing. They also have solos for each of their four members!\n\naespa, ITZY, IVE are great aswell\n\nIf you like rock-based music, Dreamcatcher is just incredible\n\nNMIXX, Billlie, Craxy are super cool, they have some \"weird\" songs so it may be a bit disorienting at first, but once you understand their concepts, you end up craving for more lol\n\nThose on top of my head, but there are many amazing ggs and soloists out there!",

            "comment": "I'll try recommend groups I haven't seen much here, as there are many underrated gems/ones which should be talked about more:\n\n* **Dreamcatcher** \\- A decently popular, rockbased sound group with 7 members. A lot of their songs sound like anime openings, but they do experiment quite a bit. Many of their music videos also have a contuinity storywise and they have amazing lyrics! Plus, they are awesome at singing live. **Recommended songs: Goodnight, Bonvoyage, BOCA, Can't Get You Out Of My Mind, Eclipse and Odd Eye.**\n* **G-(IDLE)** \\- Want something deep and meaningful? or something silly and goofy? Well G-(Idle) has both! From deep, poetic lyrics empowering women and telling beautiful stories, or just silly goofy fun to dance too whenever you're in the mood too! They have Soyeon who's an amazing producer and lots of very unique vocal colours which you won't find anywhere else. This is a very popular group. **Reccomended songs: Hwaa, Oh My God, Latata, Paradise, Dahlia, Queencard and What's in your hous**e\n* **9Muses** \\- A small 2nd gen group lots of line up changes, but also one of the best discographys in the entirety of KPOP (Trust me, I don't use \"Flawless discography\" lightly but this is one of the very few times a group has exactly that). They also have a very sad story as shown in the docummentary. Definetely recommend you check them out!  Plus, they have an awesome vocal line and such a good rap line. **Reccomended songs: Hurt Locker, Remember (2017), Wild, Dolls, Figaro, and Sleepless Nights.**\n* **Fromis9 -** The unofficial queens of bubblegum pop. Very underrated and deserve lots of love. If you're into fiftyfifty and newjeans you'll 100% like their vibrant, upbeat songs which can turn anyones frown upside down!. **Recommended songs: Love Bomb, Glass Shoes, and Fun.**\n* **Loona -** Despite the boycott and recent controversies, this group is full too the brim of talented girls and also one of the funniest fandoms as a bonus. Just get used to the common unfair line distributions! Plus it has a very interesting loonaverse concept. **Recoomended songs: Why Not, Hi High, So What, Flip That, Heart Attack (Chuu), and Butterfly**\n* **WJSN -** Let's see... A 5 member vocal line, one of the most underrated 3rd gen female rappers, great dancing, live vocals. Do I need to say more? **Recommended songs: Last Sequence, Done, Unnatural, As You Wish, Save me Save You, Full Moon, Happy, Bebe**\n\nHope you enjoyed my ramble haha! I stan **TWICE** too, so check them out aswell! **IVE, Stray Kids (My favourite Boy Group), Ateez (Boy Group), Girls' Generation, Iz\\*One, Gfriend** and many others are other popular groups which are great. Hope I helped!",

            "comment": "You should check out ALICE (formerly known as ELRIS)! They are really underrated and they have cute tracks like [Roopretelcham](https://youtu.be/v4eYk41U_wg), [Summer Dream](https://youtu.be/tpLro7n3PWo) and [Focus](https://youtu.be/9wO1B7MZ8gY)! They have other great songs but these were the ones I can name from the top of my head!",

            "comment": "Listening to Billlie is a MUST. They genuinely have a flawless discography. Not a SINGLE skip. Every comeback, they switch up their concept so you can expect to hear a variety of styles when listening to their title tracks. Billlie\u2019s bsides primarily consist of R&amp;B influenced funk/electro/dream pop, and are some of the best songs I\u2019ve genuinely ever heard. Not to mention, all of the girls are incredibly genuine, hilarious, and naturally beautiful. They are such a joy to keep up with. I honestly recommend sitting down and listening to all of their mini albums.  However, some standout tracks for me have been Various and Precious (moment of inertia), Brave ~ A song for Matilda, Overlap (1/1), GingaMingaYo (obviously), RING X RING, MOON palace, and fl!pping a coin!",

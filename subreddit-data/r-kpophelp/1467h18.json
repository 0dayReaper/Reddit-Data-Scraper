The filters often come in handy when the lighting is too \"warm\" or too \"cold\", and depending on the model you can crop or edit the video clips using the functions provided in the Gallery app. (My current Galaxy A23 only provides rotation and running time adjustments for videos, but on my previous A53 I was also able to crop them, flip them like mirror mode, or even add filters.) Definitely do NOT recommend A23s for fandom stuff. A51 or A53 functions are more suitable.",

            "comment": "Being caucasian isn\u2019t really a huge problem. Depending where in Asia you\u2019re from, companies could look favorable or not. This is mostly the case with China bc the government from China are trying to block off a majority of kpop. This narrative really took off with the case of kris wu where the gov has a concrete reason (according to them). Thats why you see more jpn idols in kpop over chinese idols in kpop. These days, less ppl are giving birth, plus a lot of young kids want to be youtubers over idols. companies these days travel overseas to look for trainees. If you fit their requirements, I say it won\u2019t be much of a problem.\n\nIn Kazuha\u2019s case (this is super rare btw, almost winning the lottery), she trained with hybe overseas via zoom by herself for a month or two, then moved to Korea. This sort of case is happening way more frequently than you think.",

There have been times I didn't recognize them, or mistook them for someone else, because their makeup was done differently than their typical style.",

But I have seen a couple of white passing idols or trainees who get so much hate just because they aren\u2019t fully Asian\u2026. So it is up to if you want to give it a try or not.",

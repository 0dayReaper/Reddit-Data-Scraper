BTS was considered a nugu group if I can say ? and was by no means popular before because when they debuted groups like BIGBANG, SUJU (ig), INFINITE, 2PM, EXO probably were at the top and the most well known BGs so I was just curious to know how did you find them and stan them. Were you already Kpop stans prior to that ? Or did you find them randomly ?",

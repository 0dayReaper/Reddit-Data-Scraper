    "postText": "I remember when I first got into K-pop I devoured every and any thing I heard. Now I feel like not only am I spoiled for choice, but also that my taste has become a lot more narrow, making it harder for me to find groups to actively listen to, let alone \"stan\". I don't care what company the recommendations are from, all that I ask if that they are girl group recs only.\n\nTo give you an example of my taste:\n\nI like MAMAMOO (No bias)\n\nI like Red Velvet (Mostly their Velvet tracks. Seulgi is by far my bias)\n\nI love f(x) (And probably always will. No bias)\n\nI **LOVE** (G)I-DLE (Yuqi's voice and personality is one of my favorite things, she's def my bias)\n\n\\- if I didn't mention a super popular girl group above chances are I'm aware of them and either they aren't my speed or I have no strong feelings one way or another. Because I try to stay in the loop with the popular stuff I guess I'm mostly either seeking new and up-and-coming groups to the scene or lesser know groups. Any group size is good and nugu is welcome.\n\nOh and these days I'm not much for too much of cutesy k-pop stuff. There was a time when I loved it but for the past few years I've gravitated away from it big time. Same goes for school/teen crush. On the other hand, I consider girl crush, retro and dark concepts to be my favorites.\n\nThank you for reading and thank you to anyone who might help!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

There's a member named Tsuki, right? I believe that's how I've heard of them. Either way I'll give their music a listen!",

But I think [Bon Voyage](https://open.spotify.com/track/3Jnwl9zlbFNEqKQjydxLxe?si=wza4pfLBSm2D9-VR-ph54w) and [Boca](https://open.spotify.com/track/37Ctz6MOHM2thzNIOMo7Z0?si=k8jAvUa2QOiVXdp1taaCEw) are better starter songs. The group generally does rock / pop rock music, and theyve got this dark, fantasy, sometimes creepy concept that they pull off really well.",

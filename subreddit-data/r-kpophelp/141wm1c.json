They have other stores too in the same vicinity for stage play actors, voice actors, V-tubers, etc. \n\nThey go pretty cheap too (make the weak yen work for you lol) and since the Japanese fans don't really hold on to a lot of stuff, there's so much to look through.",

            "comment": "Yes you can buy Japanese kpop albums in Japanese music stores that are franchises (Tower records, HMV &amp; Books). I personally preferred HMV&amp;BOOKS because you can search the item on their website (use a translator if you need to) and check the in-store stock of the item which is pretty accurate. The interface is also just more user friendly imo. It definitely helped finding the specific album I was looking for as there are many store locations across Japan.",

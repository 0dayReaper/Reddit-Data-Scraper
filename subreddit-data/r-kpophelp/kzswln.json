I eat all day and I\u2019m still hungry\u201d; \u201cMom keeps bothering me, why, why, why?\u201d\n\nThree Times a Day: \u201cIf you like your friends so much, date your friends\u201d\n\nDo It Again: \u201cLike Taecyeon said, you\u2019re my ear\u2019s candy\u201d\n\nAnd, as someone else mentioned, Mamamoo are definitely the queens of silly/funny songs: Sleep In The Car, Aze Gag, Recipe, Taller Than You... it\u2019d be way too tedious to list all of their humorous lyrics.\n\nSuper Junior have a lot too, especially their sub-units SJ-H and SJ-T, which again would take too long to list, but Charm of Life (featuring Solar!) is a good example.\n\nEDIT: Suddenly remembered Ladies\u2019 Code Kiss Kiss (\u201cTo be honest, our breath stinks a little\u201d; \u201cTonight, in my dreams, Won Bin oppa will appear\u201d)",

Like bro Baby V.O.X. blew up in their third year, while 6kies disbanded in their third year... Even Fin.K.L. \"stopped activities\" right after S.E.S. formally disbanded in 2002. The difference is, S.E.S. debuted 97 and disbanded 02 (a full contract term), Fin.K.L. debuted 98, blew up 99, \"halted activities\" (a.k.a. disbanded) in 02. \n\nFuck DSP.",

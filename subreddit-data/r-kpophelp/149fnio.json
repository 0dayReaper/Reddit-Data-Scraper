Parasocial relationships are a tricky path so tread carefully. Also remember that every idol is a real human being with feelings; if you talk bad about an idol they can absolutely see it.   \nSo I guess TL;DR: just be a kind human being :)",

So I think any advice I can give basically boils down to \u201ckeep any negative, critical or not complementary opinions about idols to yourself, a private twitter account (if you decide to use twitter) or a very trusted close circle of your friends and you\u2019ll pretty much be ok.\u201d \n\nReddit is more tolerant, especially when you\u2019re echoing what everyone is thinking about whoever they\u2019ve decided to pile on that day, but still be careful with that. \n\nOther than that, you should pretty much be ok.",

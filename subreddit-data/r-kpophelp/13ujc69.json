    "postText": "Hello! \nFor a little bit of background, I will be moving out of the country in a few months, and I want to give my friend who is a new STAY a gift. Since I can\u2019t bring my Nachimbong with me, I want to turn mine into a custom snow globe for her. (She already has her own Nachimbong) \n\nI found some cool 3d printed compass stars so far on Etsy but I am looking for some other Stray Kids specific stuff to float in the globe like glitter on mini acrylic charms. I can only seem to find the charms already on brackets and keychains and even those only have one to a few charms on them. \n\nDoes anyone know where I can get these items as a standalone in like a pack? Or a site where I can get them made? \n\nThank you! \u0669(^\u203f^)\u06f6",

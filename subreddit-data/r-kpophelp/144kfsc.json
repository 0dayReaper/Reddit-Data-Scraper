While it can be a really meaningful gift for idols who are not as financially successful, I find it absolutely useless for idols from the big 4 who are generally very well off financially several years into their career. \n\nIdols usually prefer unique gifts. Things that show someone put a lot of time and work into crafting it. That or cute things they can use.",

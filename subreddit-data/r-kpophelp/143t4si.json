    "postText": "(TLDR: Been a casual stan for awhile, now am getting alot more serious about it &amp; want to know what else they do outside of comebacks. I only currently know of Chan's livestreams but don't know where he does thoes now since the Vlive shutdown)\n\nI'd been a casual fan of Stray Kids since Cl\u00e9: Levanter Era. Recently I've been following them more closely where I feel I can really consider myself a Stay. \n\nFor context I have trouble keeping up with all the groups/artists I stan (both in &amp; outside of Kpop) so for the past 7 years that I've liked Kpop, I've just usually only seriously followed 1 group at a time, meaning I watched interviews &amp; content besides thier music &amp; for the others just kept up with comebacks only.\n\nStray Kids is becoming my new main focus now since my last group is inactive currently. I'm actually really excited to be seriously getting into another group again for the first time since 2018. \n\nI know Chan does livestreams but I don't know where since Vlive shutdown &amp; that's about all I know. I know every group does something different &amp; again outside of the other groups music releases I've essentially \"lived in a bubble\" the past 5 years &amp; don't know where to begin with Stray Kids. \n\nAlso want to mention that Stray Kids only being my main focus now, is nothing against them, just how my brain works. I've never seriously followed more than one Artist/group at a time even before I got into Kpop.",

That's also where they mostly do their lives nowadays, including Chan's Room.\n\nThere are some fanmade webites too like [Channel SKZ](https://ch-skz.netlify.app/) and [Skzflix](https://skzfliix.carrd.co/) where you can browse around.\n\nI also recommend Finding Stray Kids, it has 3 seasons.",

Other comments have listed SKZ Code, 2 Kids Room, Finding Stray Kids, those are all good, they're like the specially produced fun content as opposed to SKZ-Talker, which is just like a vlog of them behind the scenes of music shows and concerts and stuff. \n\nNow that's the official stuff. If you want collections of chaos gathered together by fans, there are tons of videos out there that take fun little bits and pieces from various official videos and group them together to show the kids' chaos, lovey-doveyness with each other, collections of butt-hunting, them trying to kiss each other, more chaos, etc. I'd be happy to recommend some of my favorite channels for fanmade videos if you'd like :)",

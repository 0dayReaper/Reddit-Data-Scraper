    "postText": "I'm not quite sure how to describe the specific sound I'm looking for: the songs are all in 6/8 (I think), and have sorta similar instrumentation and dramatic/theatrical(?) vibes. Here's my playlist if you could spare some time for a listen:\n\n* SAAY's [No Time To Waste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvsQX8n3uQ)\n* BIBI's [Animal Farm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5My6q2D2nzo)\n* Conda's [30minutes in Seoul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYVR1VMNc5w) (ft. naar)\n* YAYA KIM's [I hope everything disappears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zw_oznycsg)\n* Choi Beck Ho's [The Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNF9t5ij-OY)\n* Jang Jane's [Shame On You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zFI3ydBuhg)\n* 015B's [No Stars In Your Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZUk1ZJDJJw) (ft. Yeona)\n* SWJA's [Fall Fall Fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWVYwM_p8aM)\n* (sorta, but with more minimal instrumentation: KATIE's [All About You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVdw28D1yzQ))\n* (sorta, but preferably without the rap and 808: M.O.N.T.'s [Noir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9L_469Gz3Q))\n\nPlease recommend some songs that are similar to the ones linked above. Thank you!",

So here are a few songs you might like :\n\n* [IU - Between The Lips (50cm)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBVca5KOpkM)\n* [Seulgi - 28 Reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usWZz-MMeP0)\n* [Lee Jin Ah - Rum Pum Pum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmRXxNg3wIc) (i personally think this song is kind of genius, but it's different)",

It's not really just dramatic songs I'm looking for, but a very specific style of dramatic music (the 6/8 time signature for example is non-negotiable although I'm more flexible on instrumentation). I'm familiar with these three songs (and yes, I concur on Lee Jin Ah's genius!) but they are very different from what I'm looking for.",

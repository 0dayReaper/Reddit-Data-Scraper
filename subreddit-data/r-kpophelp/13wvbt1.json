    "postText": "Hi, everyone. I need help finding a song I listened to some 2 years ago. It is a boy group song (maybe 3rd gen, not sure). I remember that it was sort of comical in tone, the lyrics were something about how hot it is during summer, and I think that some fruit was also mentioned in the lyrics (maybe bananas or watermelon, idk). Thanks in advance. \ud83d\ude43",

    "postText": "I was a casual BTS follower until Jan this year when I began to get into kpop, through Stray Kids. And then Seventeen. I haven\u2019t listened to all their discography but what got me into all 3 groups is that they\u2019re super talented and make their own music. \nPeople often tell me I should check out Ateez next. Where should I begin? Music videos, B-sides, anything?\n\nI know it was a live performance that really made me stan BTS (NPR tiny desk concert), Stray Kids (Kingdom) and Seventeen (Killing voice). Something like that would be good. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s easier to recognize and get into the members if I watch behind the scenes content, so please recommend some of those links too.",

They were really good, it is hard to pick a favourite but my top 2 have to be Answer:ode to joy and their From the wonderland perfomance. I have not heard a song from them that I don't like, so have a look at their music videos as well and their Wanteez show on youtube.",

I got into Kpop via Stray Kids and then saw ATEEZ on Kingdom Legendary War, saw them in concert in London and that was it!\n\nI'd recommend watching the various ATEEZ shows on YT. My favourites being Stressor Things, ANEWS (a Yunho led \"news\" show) and WANTEEZ - the latest episode shows them getting drunk and it's great to see them just being able to kick back and enjoy themselves!\n\nYou can't go wrong stanning them. They're a great bunch of lads who are hardworking and passionate about everything they do!",

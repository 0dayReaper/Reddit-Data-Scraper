It's my first time having an update account and it's also very new. I always see people recruiting new admins but I'm honestly scared that they will steal my account and change passwords or similar stuff... Can you maybe give me tips and tricks and how you even recruit an additional admin and you know how to check if it's a real fan? Thank you\ud83e\ude77",

Do some careful research before approving anybody, don't accept new and/or less active accounts, anyone who tweets about their favorite group aaaaaaaall the time is very likely to be a real fan. Pay attention to whether they engage with other fans or not, if they have a lot of friends in the fandom that's a huge green flag!",

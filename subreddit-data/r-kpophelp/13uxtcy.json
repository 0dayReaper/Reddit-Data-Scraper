I believe the Atlanta show will be at the Masquerade which is standing room only, so the nice thing is if there's someone tall in front of you, you can move around to get a better view instead of being constrained to a seat, or if you ask nicely, they might let you stand in front of them. My recommendation for the best view though is to try to find a spot at the sides or on the second or third floor because most people will be trying to stand directly in front of the center of the stage.",

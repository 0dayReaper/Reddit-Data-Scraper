Your criteria for collecting, e.g. based on groups/bias/market price?\n2. How do you set your eyes on which card to collect?\n3. Where do you buy them? (eBay? Mercari?)\n4. Your personal pains/ bad experiences while shopping for them?\n\nThanks in advance, my dm is also open if you\u2019re willing to answer but due to privacy reasons don\u2019t wanna discuss in public!\n\nEdit:\n\nAdditional questions, 1. do you resale your cards? Do you take into consideration the chance of reselling them when buying cards?\n2. How do you organize your existing and Wishlist cards?",

            "comment": "Usually I stick to buying/collecting strictly album cards because so many groups (*cough cough* NCT *cough) do a lot of lucky draws, POBs, and special event PCs that are either hard to get or just so expensive.\n\nI recommend Mercari JPN and Instagram for buying (although you always have to make sure you're being safe on Insta bc there's a lot of snakes on there). Mercari Japan is really good for collecting less popular members of groups and you can find a lot of cards for like &lt;$5 on there.\n\nMy criteria is if it's above $10, no with exceptions (bias, super rare/pretty card, you get it). I also don't mind mildly damaged cards but i prefer not to have them.\n\nPersonally i prefer PCs that are bright and colorful, have unique camera angles, filters, etc. Pretty much anything that might make it really stand out from your classic peace sign selfie on a white wall.",

            "comment": "1. My top priorities are usually \u201cis it a photo I like?\u201d, \u201cis it my bias from the group?\u201d, and \u201ccan I afford it?\u201d But if I like a picture aesthetically enough, or how the idol is styled, and I know who the idol is or they are from a group I like, but aren\u2019t my number one bias from that group, I will sometimes still consider it. But most of the time I don\u2019t really want to spend the money unless I know I will really really like it, so I mostly collect my biases. For me it\u2019s mostly about liking the picture, so I even have a section in my pc binder for lomo cards and fan made cards and fan made mini instax things. \n\n2. If I just see a card while browsing, or in other peoples pics, etc, and I feel some sort of instant connection with the picture, then I will search for the card.\n\n3. Mostly on mercari, sometimes I\u2019ve bought them from people selling on Reddit, once in a blue moon I\u2019ll buy from eBay. Most people seem to buy on Instagram a lot too, but I have no idea how to find people selling on there lol, I kind of use my Instagram in its own way, and don\u2019t really want my explore page full of people selling random cards I probably don\u2019t even have any interest in\u2026I want to keep that page full of art of cats and fan accounts for my ult bias lol. \n\n4. Personal pains: when there\u2019s a card you really really want, but it is wildly expensive everywhere you find it, and it\u2019s just way too out of your budget. While I collect, maybe I only collect semi-casually, as I really can\u2019t justify spending so much for what\u2019s basically a little piece of thick paper lol, yet some cards can be rare and cost a lot. Maybe someday if I have more of a disposable income I will feel differently. Bad experiences: I bought some from someone who I had bought from before and had a good experience with, but this next time I bought from them I think it got lost in the mail. I regret not asking to add a tracking number to it. I waited too long before realizing they weren\u2019t ever going to arrive, and felt like it had been too long to let the person know they never arrived. Now it\u2019s been maybe a year, and I still think about it lol. I still want to ask for a refund, but it has been too long, and they would have every right to assume I\u2019m lying and that I really received them, since it has no tracking they can check either. Another bad experience was I searched all over for some cards I wanted that were kind of pricey, trying to find the cheapest ones. They still cost much more than other official cards I\u2019ve bought, but not so much that it felt like they\u2019d break the bank. They were being shipped from abroad, so I had to wait a while. It wasn\u2019t until after they had shipped that I started to feel wary. I already had some cards from the same set, and started to anticipate needing to compare the new ones I\u2019d bought to these ones I already had, to check if the quality and materials matched. Sure enough they didn\u2019t, and the ones I\u2019d bought really seemed to be fake, and I was so bummed out. I once again went searching for the cards. After comparing prices of a few, I bought the cheapest ones. They were a lot more than the first ones I had bought, and they might remain the most expensive ones I\u2019ll ever buy lol. I waited and hoped they wouldn\u2019t be fake. Luckily though their quality and materials matched the ones I already had from pulling from an album, so I felt I could assume they were real. I\u2019m glad I have the cards, but I don\u2019t want to ever spend that much on cards at once again lol. And I was really bummed about the first purchase turning out to be fake. The description didn\u2019t say anything about them being fake/lomo/fan made, and I use eBay for buying cards so infrequently, so it didn\u2019t cross my mind to ask the seller about that before buying them.",

                            "comment": "If it's through something like etsy or mercari, or ebay too, I think you can usually do something like open a dispute. But usually if person sends it as stamped, without a tracking number, there's really nothing you can do. I've had a few instances as a seller where I sent a package but the tracking never updates, and when you have a tracking number and still have the shipping label saved to your downloads you can contact the postal service with all that info so they can look for it in their system. The time one didn't arrive to me, was when I was buying through reddit, so there wasn't really anything I could do since it didn't have a tracking number. Through ebay, I probably should have opened some dispute or even asked the seller about it after receiving the ones that seemed to be fake. I did leave a review that said something like \"sellers really need to put in descriptions if cards aren't official\" lol, and kinda hoped they might contact me to at least say sorry, but they never contacted me about the review so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. I could still find the cards elsewhere (even if they were pricey), and it takes a lot to make me mad enough to like tell someone off to their face (even over the internet lol), so I just kind of rolled my eyes about the fake ones and let it go. Maybe if I wasn't able to find the cards anywhere else, I might have said something more to that seller.",

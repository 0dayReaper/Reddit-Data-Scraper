I had to Google it and found [an article](https://www.nme.com/news/music/kimchi-festival-canada-line-up-kpop-tickets-details-3440686) listing a few groups and soloists (like VIVIZ, Billlie, Xdinary Heroes, Jamie Park and Sunye).\n\nWhat are your thoughts about it?",

            "comment": "As someone who lives in Saskatchewan - it seems like a super weird choice. We're pretty middle-of-nowhere here, and are frequently passed over on tour schedules (particularly of non-Canadian artists) in favour of larger cities like Calgary, Vancouver, or Toronto. Never thought I'd see a Kpop artist come closer to me than Vancouver. Apparently I was wrong!\n\nThat being said, it looks like a fun time, and I hope it's successful and returns in future years, maybe with some groups I stan lol",

How come some smaller completely new company with no connections can get their artists to perform on inkigayo or mnet or whatever but there\u2019s not been a single independent artist on those performance shows? \n\nWhat qualifies as a kpop agency? How would someone go about starting up their own agency? Do you need licenses or anything? What\u2019s the minimum staff/trainers you\u2019d need?\n\nHow do they set up concerts and things? What is the difference between a manager and the founder(esp in smaller companies?)",

They hire students/employees and train them for as long as they think they are not perfect and make them perfect on their own terms. Teach them stuff like singing, dancing, rapping etc. \nWhen the employee is trained , they give them a contract to join them permanently. \nNow consider companies as Microsoft, Google, samsung and apple. Every company have different working structure and environment. \n\nThe entertainment companies (big ones) have tie ups with TV stations for making their idols appear without any problems. Small companies can also ask the TV stations but the slots are very less so only the employees of Microsoft will be considered above samsung. \n\nThe companies provide idols their living dorms, manages their staff and their basically everything. \n\nAnd ofc you need a license to start any type of company. I don't think there is any fixed amount of employees a company must have.. I remember that bighit used to have like 7-10 staff members.",

For example, both Pledis and Source music CEOs worked for SM, RBW founder was at Cube, etc.",

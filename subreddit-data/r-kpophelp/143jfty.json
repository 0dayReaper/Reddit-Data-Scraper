    "postText": "Hi guys!!! \n\nI was supposed to go to Seoul next month but saw BTS FESTA activities for next week so I hurried up, like a crazy person, to go this weekend. I have no idea what the festival on the 17th is supposed to be but I hope it\u2019s something special. Any thoughts on this? \n\nBut my main reason for being here is I want to get lots of MERCH! Please drop your best locations here if you\u2019re familiar. I know there\u2019s a couple stores that sell albums from my last visit, but I don\u2019t buy albums unfortunately. I\u2019m mainly in the market for hoodies, lightstick and whatever else type of merch is out there. \n\nAlso, anybody experienced with hybe insight, kwangya cafe and idk if there\u2019s other company things? I want to see ALL the things. \n\n\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c happy festa",

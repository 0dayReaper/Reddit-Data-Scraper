How did you like it?I\u2019m considering buying it but I have very sensitive skin and I can\u2019t use products with fragrance. I\u2019ve seen unboxing on YouTube but it doesn\u2019t mention how the skincare worked over time with use.",

I also have very sensitive skin (I have bad flares of eczema / psoriasis) but I had no reaction and actually really liked how they made my skin look, if anything it actually helped control my skin from flaring up.\n\nThat being said, they did have quite a strong fragrance and while that personally does not affect me very much I would say if you react to fragrance then the products are probably not for you!",

It\u2019s perfect for dry weather/skin. I generally really love their products and thank skz for introducing me to it!",

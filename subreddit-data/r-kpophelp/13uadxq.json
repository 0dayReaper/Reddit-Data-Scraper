This song is the epitome of bubblegum pop imo. It\u2019s catchy, energetic, fun, and also incredibly deep when you look into it.\n\n3. Orange Caramel - Catallena. This is just a masterpiece of the genre, nothing less. Whatever geniuses wrote the lyrics and directed the music video deserve some kind of award.",

The vocal line did amazingly here, the song is engaging throughout and I love the way the chorus feels different every time. Additionally, the drop is really strong but doesn't feel out of place.\n\n**LOONA OEC - Uncover (since Butterfly was taken):**\n\nDream pop + LOONA = instant hit. Innovative beat and the girls' delivery was perfect. Super relaxing yet energetic at the same time. My favorite LOONA sub-unit track\n\n**SNSD - Gee**\n\nKpop's defining anthem. It pretty much invented the electro x bubblegum pop genre and Taeyeon went OFF in the last chorus without going overkill. Cute but not saccharine, energetic but not overly so, mainstream but not generic. A perfect track. \"Listen boy, my first love story,\" will remain iconic.\n\n**Hon Mentions**\n\nSistar - I Swear\n\nBrave Girls - Deepened, We Ride\n\nRed Velvet - Automatic\n\nLoona - Ding Ding Dong\n\nHaseul - Let Me In\n\nLoona yyxy - Love4eva\n\nTripleS - Colorful, Chowall\n\nTripleS AAA - Generation, Charla, Dimension\n\nTripleS KRE - Touch, Deja Vu, Dimension\n\nSumin - Gonlan Song\n\nNewJeans - Cookie, Ditto, OMG\n\nYukika - Orange Road, Soul Lady, Cherries Jubiles",

Has everything that I like- it allows each member their moment to shine, a great bridge with a killer final chorus held up by sone amazing vocals with tight harmonies \n\nBigBang - Bang Bang Bang.  I love how hard it goes with the switch ups and different sounds.  That beat drop is *nasty* - so unexpected but *so good*.  And TOP\u2019s rap is absolutely killer.  \n\nKara - Step - I don\u2019t know how else to put it other than to me it is *the* quintessential kpop song.  So bouncy, so catchy, so fun, and an absolute ear worm.  \n\nDreamcatcher - Good Night. I love the Evanescence-y vibes the whole song is just this Nu metal/emo rollercoaster that just doesn\u2019t stop.  \n\nAespa - Black Mamba.  Best debut by a girl group since SNSD, IMO.  I love how it just punches you in the face with the chorus, and how it sets up that punch every single time.  And Ningning and Winter\u2019s bridge does a great job in sending it home.  The song that kept 4th Gen kpop alive for me.",

Sour Grapes by LE SSERAFIM (such a chill, feel-good song)\n5. I \u2260 DOLL by HUH YUNJIN (Yunjin's music is so good mmmm)\n6. Cool by NMIXX (same vibes as Sour Grapes)\n7. Love in Space by Cherry Bullet (Cherry Bullet songs &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;)\n8. What is Love by TWICE (all Twice title tracks are absolute bops)\n9. Beautiful Monster by STAYC (idk, it's a bop :D)\n10. Wrap Me In Plastic by MOMOLAND (2020 TikTok nostalgia lmaoo)\n\nA few songs I've had on replay recently:\n\n1. Allergy by (G)I-DLE\n2. Welcome to My World by aespa\n3. I Am by IVE\n\n(GG stan forever and always \u2661)\n\nAlso ty for the song recs, Butterfly is already one of my faves :D",

Their vocals are just so amazing and the [hello82 live performance](https://youtu.be/Jxgwc0Y9tuw) was something else. Jaw was on the floor.  \n\n\n\u2022 Guerrilla by ATEEZ. The one that always gets me hype no matter what. It never fails. I\u2019m always singing and dancing along to this one and just feel more awake after lol \n\n\n\u2022 Sorry I\u2019m Not Sorry by Monsta X. This last song was hard to choose because there are so many songs that I listen to a lot and prob more than this one. It\u2019s so different from what monsta x normally does but it\u2019s one of my favorite songs of theirs and one of my favorite chill/relax songs.

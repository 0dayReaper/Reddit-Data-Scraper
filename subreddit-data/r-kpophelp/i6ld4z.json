    "postText": "Hey guys so firstly this post will be a little emotional\nSo few days ago I stumbled upon this viral tweet of a nugu grps ceo. So I didn't even know that such super small gros even existed I'm a sm artists stan so I never really knew what it feels like to stan a super small group. So basically the tweet https://twitter.com/saturday718/status/1281762923384168450?s=19\nAdressed the backlash they got for low budget. The ceo said I won't give up on these girls and called them him daughters. I really can't describe it so you should read the tweet for sure. I immediately bursted into tears reading it. I know a lot of Grps like this exist but seeing the attitude of that ceo who decided not to give up on their and his dreams made me cry.\nI decided to chcek out thier song and yes the song was a bop. \nThe worst thing that happened recently is their instagram got hacked! I was heart broken when I heard that their company sadly don't have the ability to get it back meaning they are losing their instagram acc where they used to promote stuff.seeing them go through so many hardships is so inspiring to me. I hope this inspires everyone as well .\nI know we can't help all grps but now that you've read this post (thankyou for reading) now that their existence has reached to you please even you checking them out will do great wonders for them. \nI'm Linking their new song please check it out.\nhttps://youtu.be/yXZCzFvs1tw\nAnd it's okay if you don't want to check it out don't feel Guilty I don't want to guipt trip Anyone I just made this post in hopes that they gain some attention. \ud83e\udd7a",

This just shows how much he respect his/her artists and their talents and not exploit them to be moneymakers. \n\nIt's good to be professional, but showing empathy and emotional intimacy like this is so heartwarming.

They were getting a lot of backlash for the teaser photis because they like stretched the girls out in the photos? and you could tell they were really low budget :( I felt so bad when I read the apology. \n\nAlso some good news is that they achieved 1 million views in less than a week, which is really good for a lesser known group like them. They're also getting credit for designing their own outfits for the music video and all the music shows theyre going on which I think is really sweet! Yesterday they also met Kang Daniel and gave him a signed copy of their album haha. \n\nI feel so bad for them I already posted on r/kpoprants after their instagram got hacked and what did they do to deserve this?? It's so sad honestly but its really nice to see theyre still going strong with smiles on their faces",

Most fans don't even care to look into a new group from outside of the big 3 agencies, let alone the many dozens of other agencies out there.\n\nThere's lots of groups with great personalities, songs, talent that go unnoticed by the masses. We should all try to at least check out and support some of them :)\n\nMany people think stanning lesser known groups is \"uncool\", but smaller groups' fanbases tend to be quite tight and it is much easier to interact with idols of smaller groups on stream or in comments. I think it's very rewarding :)\n\nOne group even had a member you could chat with on Instagram. Sadly the group didn't last long, but it's an experience I won't forget!",

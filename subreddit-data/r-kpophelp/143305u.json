    "postText": "I'm talking about those VIP package group photos with 6-10 randomly grouped fans. \n\nExample 1 \nhttps://www.onlyoneof.kpoplive.tv/set/bdc82f8b-0912-4281-8f36-64645f7d4ec8?pgid=bdc82f8b-0912-4281-8f36-64645f7d4ec8_dc639ba8-31b1-44ce-ada2-6257ed05758f\n\nExample 2\nhttps://www.brave-girls.kpoplive.tv/set/07871499-571e-4aa8-a20c-e186cb6eaabb\n\nWhenever a member and a fan do hearts together at camera time, is the member doing it as their gesture of choice? Or does the fan have to initiate the heart, basically ask to make the hand gesture with the member?\n\nIf it came down to it, I'd be too shy to ask, and I'll probably just have my arms limp, just like in elementary school Yearbook picture days.\n\nP.S. Sorry about posting the sample pics in advance, if it's someone's face, it's from the publicly available gallery for Studio Plav past events website. So idk about the rules about sharing public galleries on here. I suppose people gave their permission to get their pics taken for the concert organizer webpage.",

I.e. they're mostly just sitting silently looking ahead.",

They were very eager to interact with fans and incredibly good at fan service. Some members were a little TOO good lol. Not tired at all.",

So I guess the best I can go with for now is the group photo, ha ha.\n\nIf you snagged VVIP, lend me tips on how to be fast too, if you know.",

The thing is there's no code for the early access presale. I found this out by chance when I went on their website a few minutes early and realized I was able to add tickets to my cart before the general sale. I managed to get my tickets about 5-10 minutes before they went on sale to everyone else and I was queue number #222 which I believe was close to the end.\n\nSo next time just log onto their website when early access starts.",

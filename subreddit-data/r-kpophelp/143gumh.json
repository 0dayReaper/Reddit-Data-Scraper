I couldn't stop looking at her haha) . So please recommend me stuff to watch! Do they have their own entertainment shows like bts and svt? What content do they post? I want to know EVERYTHING lol please send help",

She and Yuqi appeared on an all star GG show a couple of years ago. And Yuqi, Soojin and Shuhua appeared on a couple short segments before that. Learn about Sooshu before watching these to get the full impact.\n\nG-Idle I-Talk is the source of most of the clip compilations. It chronicles everything from the beginning to now. I-Log is from the comeback. Both are official from Cube.\n\nAlso search \"recording behind\" for a lot of making of the songs.\n\nIf you're a Minnie and Soojin fan, AND YOU SHOULD BE! LOL! Watch \"I'm the Trend\", which is a fashion 'battle' series between the two. Just WOW!\n\nAnd don't miss \"Workman/Workdol\" with Shuhua, if you're a fan, AND...well, you know... &lt;GRIN&gt;",

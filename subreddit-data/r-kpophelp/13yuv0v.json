    "postText": "Hi, so I am aware that K-Pop should not be a thing I\u2019m embarrassed about but I cannot help it. I will say I have social anxiety and if you know social anxiety you know it comes with the fear of being judged, and well, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening right now to me. \n\nK-Pop doesn\u2019t have the best reputation, especially in America. People at school\u2019s and places judge it all the time saying how weird it is, how weird and annoying the fans are, so many things. It is my worst nightmare to be considered weird, I try really hard to \u201cfit in\u201d. But I have a \u201cweird\u201d hobby. This hobby, K-Pop, makes me really really happy, and I really want to go to the concert of one of my favourite groups. But I\u2019m scared to admit that I like K-Pop. \n\nI have to tell my mom about this concert since I cannot drive myself, so she\u2019d have to at least drop me off at the venue. But she needs to know whose concert it is. I don\u2019t really think she\u2019ll judge me? Maybe more like she wont understand as to why I like it? She might judge their looks a bit, saying they\u2019re \u201ctoo feminine\u201d. I\u2019m just scared she\u2019ll judge me for this. \n\nI know it\u2019s something that is my own problem, I\u2019m working on it. but I just need help on how to gain the courage to stop being scared of this judgement to tell her.\n\nSo the question is, how can I tell her. \n\n\nI already see the comment saying \u201cthis sounds like you\u2019re coming out to her or something\u201d but please, its a fear of mine so it\u2019s kind of a big deal to me, sorry\u2026.",

They're out there, and there's a decent chance everyone knows at least a few already. All the other people out there who want to put you down for who you are and what you like? They don't matter. When you're young it's easy to think that there's something wrong with you, and that those people's opinions are important. They are not important, and you're fine the way you are, with all your personality quirks and weird interests.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have a photo card album that needs sorting.",

And in college and later on as an adult really none of that high school drama matters even a tiny bit- but your self esteem, accepting and loving yourself for who you are, and your mental health DO stick with you. \nIf you're a private person and enjoy keeping it private that's one thing, but if you're struggling because you can't express a facet of who you are then that needs to be addressed",

            "comment": "Hi! Some of the comments mention being in school and being young and that contributing to being embarrassed because like, everything is embarrassing at a young age\u2014 but I\u2019m almost 30 and definitely know how it feels. Honestly, the judgement won\u2019t ever go away completely but how you react to it can definitely change.\n\nSo for me, picture a 20 something year old professional\u2014 I work with adults my age and I also work with teenagers, who are kind and wonderful but will take any and all opportunities to roast anybody for anything. I come into work every day and take myself seriously, I have serious conversations about growth and performance, I deal with complaints, I manage an entire business\u2026 and I also have a Dino from Seventeen photo card in my phone case. I wear pink eye shadow and space buns with my button up and dress pants, and have cute kpop plushies on my work backpack. Literally every time off request I put into the schedule is for a kpop concert. At the end of the day, I\u2019m taken seriously because I take myself seriously, and I expect everyone else to. And those that haven\u2019t taken me seriously? No longer work for the business\u2014 not because of kpop but because the people who have proven they can\u2019t get over my \u201csilly\u201d personality traits have proven they\u2019re not a very good fit for our business. \n\nI spent a very long time concerned about others opinion of me, specifically about liking anime and kpop in middle and high school, and all it did was make me scared to share anything about myself ever. And the friends I had, who never really knew anything about me? I haven\u2019t heard from them since graduation. Do the friends I have now, from college and adulthood like kpop? No, with the exception of one who recently got into stray kids. And do they tease me? Yes, haha. But it\u2019s the kind of teasing that comes from them being the closest people to me in the entire world. And they may not understand the whole kpop thing, but they care enough to ask me what my next concert is, or let me play the music in the car. \n\nAt the end of the day, liking anything \u201ctoo much\u201d is embarrassing. Not liking anything, or having interests? Embarrassing. Being too old (27,45, 82, what even is too old??) to like things? Embarrassing. Being Asian and liking kpop? Embarrassing. Not being Asian and liking kpop? Embarrassing. People will find any reason to make you believe something is embarrassing or too much or cringe or cheugy (do y\u2019all still say cheugy or did y\u2019all get over that word??) or whatever. But you get to decide if you\u2019re actually embarrassed. I could absolutely live a life where I never tell anything about myself and never let people know what I like. But that sounds so, so boring and I want to talk about what I like. And if someone wants to go \u201cewww, you like kpop?\u201d I just ask them \u201cdid I make fun of the things you like? You like Legos/the jonas brothers/YouTubers/ etc etc etc, did I make fun of you? That\u2019s not very kind, that\u2019s actually kind of rude\u201d because life is too short for me to spend time on people who will belittle or be rude to me. \n\nThis took me a very long time to figure out, and I expect this won\u2019t solve all your problems or make it all go away right now, but I hope as you grow and learn and meet new people you feel more comfortable in your own skin, and find who you are and what you like, whether it be kpop or anything else, and you find people who allow you the space to enjoy those things with your whole heart. Don\u2019t wait til you\u2019re 27 to realize that it was okay to unabashedly like what you like.",

But I will also state that the same problem will come about but not relating to K-pop but other aspects in your life. Therapy has been great and I recommend it, only if you can! I went years without seeing a therapist until recently. It\u2019s been the best thing to happen to me. I don\u2019t like when people state, \u201cjust go to therapy\u201d. You don\u2019t know the person\u2019s financial situations. So if that\u2019s all people will say, it\u2019s kinda dismissive. \n\nAnyways, slowly introduce K-pop into the people you trust the most. I trusted my aunt and so I mentioned it to her. It\u2019s actually really funny how it happened. Last summer we were walking her dog on a trail and notice this small brown poodle coming over (really resembled BTS\u2019 Min Yoongi\u2019s pup, Holly). My aunt started talking to them and come to find out it\u2019s their daughter\u2019s dog and she named him Yoongi. The way I lit up and was basically like, \u201cYoongi?!\u201d. Later my aunt wanted to know why I was so happy about that, so that\u2019s how I introduced her to my favorite group. \n\nI know it\u2019s kinda nerve wrecking but trust me with time it gets better. My aunt and I regularly talk about Yoongi now and even BTS. I\u2019ve gotten so comfortable with talking about K-pop with my friends who don\u2019t really understand but are happy knowing it makes me happy. I think most people truly want to support their love ones and yes, maybe they will judge, but sometimes people do it bc they don\u2019t understand it. Keep reinforcing yourself to talk about the things you like. It\u2019s okay, I promise. And if anyone gives issues about it, that says a lot more about them. I rather be weird than a jerk any day.",

It maybe too much to say to push through it since as someone said, you do sound kind of young and obviously you want to share your interests and get to know other people for it, but here\u2019s my word of advice, no matter who your favorite artist is, someone will always make fun of you. It\u2019s not even just KPOP but any boy group or girl group fan like 1D or fifth harmony, even American groups like that\u2014 someone will make fun of you for even liking the most popular rap artist that 98% of people love, you get what I mean? Me personally, I just grew confident with my music taste, I would end up going along with the jokes people made and laugh at some too (and if people end up being racist about it, it\u2019s good you leave them behind and quit associating with them because yikes) but ultimately I\u2019m just comfortable with the music I listened to and not ashamed about it like I was in middle school 6 years ago. It\u2019s hard to explain how I got to this point, but I promise you in high school, people will laugh but nobody will ultimately care. It just adds up to a sense of maturity. You have no reason to be ashamed, truly, but there might be some boys or girls in your class who haven\u2019t fully hit puberty or have seen the actual struggles in life and not know that making fun of your music taste should be the last priority on their list. I know you said it\u2019s hard, but just be honest with people, and if you\u2019re still to afraid to talk about it or you\u2019re not comfortable, name another artist. \n\nI might\u2019ve just talked in circles but as I said, the older the people are, the less they care. Your parents might shit on you to rile you up, but truthfully they probably won\u2019t actually care. And fellow students are just students, if they make fun of you, just think about in years time where you won\u2019t remember them and be living your life opening KPOP albums and pulling your bias, you know?

I was constantly made fun of because of these interests especially as a teen. All of these are considered \"geeky\" to some extent, but all of these have also become more \"mainstream\" interests over the years. Although there are still people out there in the world that make fun of other's interests and like to shame them (and that won't stop since people will always be people), I say don't mind it and keep your head high! Confidence will always counter attack them and they'll eventually stop. \n\nWe're in the golden age of globalization which has led for these once-nich\u00e9 interests to become more and more popular. Back when I was a teen I never even considered that K-pop acts would be holding constant tours world-wide and even in my own country. This means there's a bunch of us out there! \n\nI'm sure by being comfortable in your interests you'll find other like-minded people, and finding your \"tribe\" (even if it's one person, even if it's online) will help you feel less embarrassed about it. When I was a teen I had no IRL friends that were into K-pop, so I resorted to the internet to make friends who were into it! That helped so much.\n\nNow, I don't know about your mom or your relationship with her but no mother should shame their children for their hobbies and interests. Even if she finds it weird or doesn't understand, as a mother she should support you just the way that you are. Mine never understood my interests, but she never once shamed me for them. As the time goes on, I'm sure you'll be feeling more and more comfortable with it! :)",

I didn\u2019t know Korean pop groups also do dance choreography, not only sing, it\u2019s so impressive! I can\u2019t imagine someone like One Direction or [insert popular group in USA here] doing a full show with professional dancing. It\u2019s really fun to watch them and Korean language is interesting so it would make me very happy. I would really like to go to their concert, could you drive me?\u201d This way you are highlighting why K-pop groups are \u201cunique\u201d which gives you a socially acceptable excuse to listening to them. Also it immediately sounds like you are interested in linguistics/art which sounds kinda \u201ceducational\u201d. On top of that, if you genuinely pretend to not understand why your mom would think K-pop is \u201cembarrassing\u201d it\u2019s very unlikely that she\u2019ll start saying weird stuff. It\u2019s all about how you present them to her. \n\nBut! I would like to say that these are my tips from one person with social anxiety to another. In reality, there truly is nothing embarrassing about K-pop. If a hobby makes you happy then anyone who judges you for the hobby are just being judgemental assholes. :D",

It's a miserable way to live when you try to keep one of your biggest hobbies secret. And for what? At the end of the day, anyone who judges you for what you like is an asshole. Now I'm almost 30 and have my fave pc in my phone case, I blare kpop at home and on my headphones not caring if people can hear it, I talk about kpop to my family and I tell everyone who will listen about the concerts I'm gonna go to. Only now do I feel comfortable putting up posters and displaying merch. What a waste of time that was. Just embrace it. People will judge you no matter what you do or don't do so you might as well comfortably enjoy yourself.",

And your not weird for liking it at all there\u2019s like billions of people who probably like K-pop as well so you\u2019re not alone and the K-pop market is getting more exposure to America and is getting famous there so those classmates of yours is actually missing out lol.",

I have social anxiety too, and I was sooo embarrassed when this happened but they kind of just brushed it of. \nThey\u2019re definitely not into it themselves but don\u2019t care since it makes me happy ig. They did judge slightly but it was nothing major at all. It\u2019s the same with my friends as none of them like kpop either.\n\nI recently asked if I could get Enhypen tickets if they release tour dates near me, and I\u2019ve asked about BTS before too, I always find it nerve racking to bring up kpop around them but since I\u2019m desperate for them I have no choice but to ask. \n\nThe worst your mum will do is say it\u2019s strange, she can\u2019t really do much else - so just own it. It\u2019s much better now that my parents actually know I like it as before I actively tried to hide it for whatever reason, so the same might go for you once you ask. Just tell her there\u2019s a group touring and you would like to see them, then you only need to specify if you ask which makes it easier than saying all the details all at once, dw too much about it",

I understand this fear completely especially growing up with peers from elementary to high school that judged my interest. I\u2019ve always liked kpop and had few friends that were also into kpop so I\u2019d only speak to them about it. It was comforting to know I\u2019m not alone. I feel like nowadays kpop is being a lot more widely accepted compared to back then. I think there is a stigma with liking kpop but at the same time I validate myself by judging other people\u2019s interests that were mainstream back then lol. Kpop has always made me happy so I would ignore what my peers would say. \n\nEven though my parents didn\u2019t understand my obsession, they\u2019d still take me to concerts when I couldn\u2019t drive. I\u2019d definitely just be honest that it\u2019s an artist that you really want to see in person and there might not be an opportunity in the future because there\u2019s always so much uncertainty with kpop groups! Hopefully, you\u2019ll be able to go. Don\u2019t worry about being judged! Every kpop concert I\u2019ve been to, I\u2019ve met many great people that I still talk to through social media. Hopefully surrounding yourself with more fans of kpop will help you feel more comfortable!",

            "comment": "I can relate to this! I honestly felt like because of my age it would be seen as weird but most people to be into Kpop. A lot of people see it as basically a teenage girl thing unfortunately. And I have social anxiety too so as much as I want to not care what people think, I still do. It took me a while to admit openly I like it, even to people I knew wouldn\u2019t judge me or care. It was just baby steps. \n\nI think what\u2019s important is changing people\u2019s misconceptions about it. I think a lot of people just harshly judge based on what very little they know about it and what they do know is pretty negative. At the end of the day it\u2019s really just music though. Pretty much everyone I\u2019ve talked about Kpop to I just suggest them songs or videos I think they would like. My mom likes R&amp;B so I showed her some songs that fit her taste and she liked it. \n\nAs far as school goes though unfortunately kids will always be judgmental. I remember when I was afraid to talk about liking anime cause it was considered nerdy. Don\u2019t push yourself if you don\u2019t feel comfortable, but I\u2019m sure people close to will understand and maybe even like it too. I know of so many parents who became fans because of their kids.",

If you\u2019re worried about your mom maybe you can convince her to let you go with a friend or yours that won\u2019t mind coming along!

I\u2019ve had friends make comments that kpop groups just look like a bunch of mass manufactured robots or it\u2019s not \u201cauthentic\u201d. All the typical misconceptions. \n\nI just respond and explain how that\u2019s definitely how the industry started out but now we have a number of self-produced groups who take their artistry and musical identity very seriously. I explain why I love kpop because it\u2019s an incredible amalgamation of different genres, out of this world art direction, top tier performances and heartwarming group chemistry. \n\nWhen I explain the history, context, merits of kpop as as an art form - they will usually respond that it\u2019s still not really for them but they definitely learned something new about the genre and have a bit more respect for it. I really enjoy watching kpop commentary channels that do deep dives and analysis - it makes me appreciate the music more and I have tangible examples to explain why this music is so special. \n\nAnother thing I do is I\u2019ll recommend a few songs 2-3 that is tailored to their music taste. So if they love rock then maybe purple kiss, g(idle) or dream catcher. If they love rnb then new jeans, XG or some Le Sserafim\u2019s bsides etc. if we are together I\u2019ll show the music video because they are incredibly well made, I\u2019d say on average better quality and attention to detail than western music videos. \n\nAlso finding more kpop friends is really encouraging. I casually mentioned that I was going to the blackpink concert and I found a fellow blink that way at work. Now we often chat about kpop related stuff. There are probably a lot more secret fans that are out there than you think lol. \n\nI hope these suggestions helps and you are able to enjoy your hobby, we all need and deserve things that bring us joy!",

Listen to rock, pop, hip hop, traditional, whatever floats your boat. You can also listen to kpop. Music is music and you can enjoy it objectively, and as a fan of the music without having to go down the rabbit hole of learning intimate details about the members or getting into non-music content. You can even enjoy those things in your personal time and still be a fan of the music outwardly, that\u2019s what I do. In fact, developing tastes outside of kpop will help you figure out how to share it with friends that aren\u2019t familiar with kpop when you can start to hear similarities. Good luck!",

            "comment": "BTS has a lot of videos like that -- their [Prologue](https://youtu.be/Bt8648TNX1M) and [Euphoria](https://youtu.be/kX0vO4vlJuU) videos specifically. Their [I Need U](https://youtu.be/jjskoRh8GTE) and [Run](https://youtu.be/wKysONrSmew) mvs are more mv than short film but they still play out like that. \n\nTXT also have some story heavy mvs. The ones that are like short films that use their respective songs sparingly are [Nap of a Star](https://youtu.be/XkDA02FHHik), [Magic Island](https://youtu.be/KskEx8K-l2Q), and [Eternally](https://youtu.be/XkDA02FHHik). [Frost](https://youtu.be/X3lA4EeeXtM) is part of the same storyline but the mv actually uses the song pretty much like a normal MV would. Then there's more normal mvs that are the song, but also tell a story and feel a bit like a drama. Recently they've had a set of connected ones: [Good Boy Gone Bad (Japanese version)](https://youtu.be/EgBg5kIeN30), [Loser=Lover](https://youtu.be/JzODRUBBXpc), and [0X1=Lovesong](https://youtu.be/d5bbqKYu51w). Then there's [Drama](https://youtu.be/UUOGVgComrU) which I also think is really good at seeming like a short drama. \n\nThese aren't all the videos like that for both groups but I think they're some of the ones that best demonstrate having stories that feel like small dramas.",

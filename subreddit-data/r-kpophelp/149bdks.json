I\u2019m sure I know more songs but I don\u2019t remember any other at this moment. Do you know any more songs like that?",

To go from a loud, driven sound in the beginning then to the bridge where they combined classical orchestration is just wild and jarring but it gets a lot of attention from those who don't know or heard SHINee before. Those who do know SHINee were really surprised too.",

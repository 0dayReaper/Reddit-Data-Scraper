I remember listening to it all the time in like 2015-2016. all I remember is that it was a k-indie song and the artist was a duo; two guys sang this song. the first part of the chorus started with the lyrics, \"\ub108\ub9cc \ubc14\ub77c\ubcf4\uba74 \ub0b4 \ub9c8\uc74c\uc740\" any help appreciated!!!\n\n\ub0a8\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4!!",

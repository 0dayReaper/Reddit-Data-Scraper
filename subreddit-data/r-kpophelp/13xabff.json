Loona isn't officially disbanded yet, but I can't see them ever having another comeback.",

This is major blow to BBC as they had already prepared an entire comeback, meaning they will not recuperate any money from that comeback.\n\nThe remaining members are unable to get out of their contracts and BBC can't do anything with them. BBC could end their contracts, but may just dungeon them until their contracts end.",

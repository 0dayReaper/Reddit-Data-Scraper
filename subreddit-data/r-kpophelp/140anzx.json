    "postText": "hello all, first post on reddit and it's on mobile so i apologize if there's any formatting issues or something!\n\ni have an assignment for one of my classes that requires us to draw/paint something related to one of our interests using complementary colors, so i thought i'd use kpop for it! my idea was to do a collage of different album covers that have complementary colors on them, but i can't really think of any off the top of my head so i thought i'd ask this sub :) can be from literally any artist, group or soloist!!",

Many western stars also have plastic surgery (not necessarily a bad thing), and are overworked and underpaid, mistreated etc. Western female stars are also sexualized or worse, is sexually assaulted by their bosses. Also, many of them are shitty people with a fake facade too. Not saying that kpop doesn\u2019t have these problems because it does, but so does every country\u2019s entertainment industry. \n\nBut locals always act like the kpop industry is this evil being and people who are kpop fans are supporting this evil system. I just don\u2019t get it. Why?",

(Really, it\u2019s just a selling point for some artists. Though, I do know that some musicians really struggle, and we should support them if we Like them. But that was mostly, for my understanding, in the mainstream rock era.) \n\nMeanwhile, KPOP is relatively new, and we should let them go through their own history and story. \n\nAmerican Music industry does do all the same crap, they\u2019re just more used to it And they know how to get away with it after generations of corruption.",

I think a lot of it does. People in America like to be comforted by the idea that these stars may be rich but they\u2019re just like them, and \u201cyou can do it too!\u201d, whereas Kpop really seems much more into the idea of portraying these perfect human beings with no physical or character flaws, which might be why it can be career ruining if an idol is found doing drugs (smoking pot), dating when they\u2019re not supposed to (breaking the rules), or if it comes out that they weren\u2019t very nice in high school or similar things.",

They would audition again  (with either them or other companies) when the notices for the next group came out and hope they were a better fit.\n\nAnd you could probably compare Transcon to BigHit the most in some ways, because they almost exclusively had boy bands on their roster (their one girl group was most well known for Britney Spears briefly having been a member in an early lineup that hadn\u2019t released anything yet).\n\nNo insult to Bang PD, because he can\u2019t be as vile as Pearlman was. Unless it turns out he was running a Ponzi scheme and ripping off small investors the entire time, but I doubt he would\u2019ve agreed to an IPO (and blown his cover) if that was the case.",

Yeah Lil Nas X and a few others in recent memory, but then there are also tons of artists that got where they are because their family knew someone or they got onto some sort of singing competition.

Name one American child star who stayed in the industry who hasn't become a mentally ill drug addict or committed suicide. Britney Spears' meltdown in 2007 was a big joke to the public and it's the same with all burnt out stars. Next time you see an out of control celebrity, instead of making fun of them you should wonder why they can't stay out of rehab.\n\nIt's not wrong to critique an industry but when people say \"The American industry isn't as bad\" it's laughable.

A ton of female idols debut as minors. The overworked is more of an issue for idols still going to school though I agree that\u2019s a problem in both industries. The underpaid is more of an issue bc these kids are in groups with a bunch of members. And they don\u2019t get any creative license in their projects. So if their companies decide to spend millions of dollars on album production, the idols end up paying for it without getting a say in it. Also the standard of beauty is ridiculous. So almost all kpop female idols have struggled in one way or another with weight. Even naturally skinny idols still struggle with food. The same things happen to western stars but the extent is less. Western stars don\u2019t talk about how they have had 12 schedules in one day and only 1-2 hours of sleep almost ever. Western stars don\u2019t talk about how they live in one apartment with 10 other ppl. Western stars don\u2019t talk about how they got in car accidents bc they were rushing somewhere in pouring rain to get to a performance in time. They don\u2019t talk about how they only drank water for a week to lose enough weight so that they don\u2019t get fired by their companies. And they don\u2019t talk about how no one asked them what song they wanted to perform. And trust me, it\u2019s not bc western artists complain less. It\u2019s bc it doesn\u2019t happen.",

If they cared to dig deeper, they would know the group members have their own singing styles, roles in the group, personalities, etc. I just wish they would be more open-minded instead of judging upon appearance.\n\nThen, there's also the system of being a trainee. To outsiders, it seems like trainees are being brainwashed into clones, which obviously isn't the case. K-pop, especially nowadays, allows for more individuality and personal expression.",

For one, there's a heavy emphasis on having good appearances and adhering to a rather specific ideal that influences the plastic surgeries. Another example is the conservative aspect of Asian cultures. You're expected to avoid causing conflict, respect your elders, and generally keep your head down. Mental health is a stigma and source of shame, so few people jump at the opportunity to reveal abusers. As a Korean-American I just feel like there's a lot of \"othering\" and sense of foreignness that makes international Kpop fans tend to look at things through a different lens than they might view their own country's artists.\n\nI guess it's also a noteworthy distinction that Kpop celebrities are \"idols,\" not just musicians or singers. Their roles go beyond performances and producing albums. They have a responsibility to uphold an image in all aspects of their lives, not just on the stage/recording studio. Think about how many idols have dating bans in their contracts, and they live in dorms with their group mates. Their careers are 24/7 rather than a job they can go home or take a break from. I feel like that's unique to Korean artists.\n\nJust my thoughts and I'm by no means claiming to be an expert on the topic!",

Though now I see they were mostly working behind the scenes, they still could have done a lot more at the outset.  Many Monbebes I know did try to boycott the agency, because they refused to support a corrupt machine that would intentionally hurt their artists. However for me, I struggled with the moral delimma of an artist myself: that undeniably, the best way to support the musician, who is in most if not all cases is an innocent party under contract, who works so hard in their everyday life to chase their dream, whether it's making it big, to make music, or to perform on stage, is to buy merch and albums, therefore also sending money to the company. In many cases nowadays, I know not all, but many -- and that does include MX since they were able to repay their debts -- the artist does get a cut of that money that Starship gets. It's the exact same in American music, even though nowadays we have a lot more artists working for themselves and releasing their own music through Apple Music, Spotify, etc...the music band model is a little less conducive to that, however, we can see the beginning of a rise of artists leaving their major entertainment companies to start their own agencies or join other musician-led agencies. i.e. Kang Daniel making his own label, IN2IT's own label, P-Nation led by Psy hosting Dawn, HyunA, Jessi, etc.",

When it turns out that an idol or a label is more \"human\" than originally portrayed, people who bought into that illusion are more disappointed than if it turns out that the American Pop Star or their record company turns out to be shady. -we just kind of assume the American business is shady, so we pass it off as \"nothing new or newsworthy.\"\n\nAt least that's my take on it, maybe y'all see something I don't.",

            "comment": "I think Kpop industry is toxic in the sense that the idols can\u2019t seem to be able to date or have much of a life outside of their music bubble.  A boy and girl look at each other cutely and K-netizens are ready to hang them for it.  They also seem to be away from their family during their training years, which is very odd to me.  Another thing I find unnecessary is that an idol can\u2019t do anything \u201cwrong\u201d without being dragged through the mud and having to apologize and \u201creflect\u201d. Yoona from SNSD hung out with a friend awhile back and sang karaoke and obviously wasn\u2019t wearing a mask and had to apologize! WTF?!?!  It\u2019s not like she was on the streets doing it. \ud83d\ude44 \n\nThe American industry definitely has it problems but I think our idols have more freedom.  They can date and pretty much do whatever they want.  They do something bad and seem to get more famous here.  If Ariana Grande was a Kpop idol and did that doughnut lick thing, her career would be over.  Let\u2019s face it.  They can speak out on issues they care about.  I don\u2019t see that happening a lot in Kpop.  \n\nI love Kpop, I just wish their idols had more freedom.  Music is their career not their life.  Let them live.",

You actually need to be scouted or chosen (which is getting harder for people without connections + money), then your whole image is pretty much made for you, some artists even have personalities that they have to stick to (an example was kesha's agency wanting her to be seen as the 'dumb blonde), and sometimes you won't even like the music they pick for you, or they won't let you release your own music because it isn't marketable enough. Not to mention all the legal issues that happen quite regularly... in kpop we all know what the idols go through, in western pop it's more hidden",

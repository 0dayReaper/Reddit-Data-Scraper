    "postText": "I have never been to a concert in Korea nor attended a k-pop concert. Therefore, I am unsure how the ticketing process works.\n\nI missed out on winning the Raffle on Weverse, and I am unsure if rest of tickets will be sold there or on another website. \n\nI even researched and learnt about INTERPARK as a method for buying tickets - but the page appears to me blank even after signing up and verifying my email.\n\nI am unsure of the system as it seems way more complicated than what I am used to in the middle east.\n\nIt would be appreciated if someone could explain the ticketing system.",

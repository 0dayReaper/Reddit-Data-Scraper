    "postText": "hi! I heard this song on a random spotify playlist during my dance class and I really liked it so I want to find it again, here's some things I remember:\n\n- has the line \"you make me oooooooh\" or something similar\n- sounds very punkish? I thought it was dreamcatcher at first\n- it reminded me of Billie eilish? Has some kind of vibe like that\n- 75% sure it's a girl group, probably not earlier than 3rd gen\n\nthank you in advance&lt;3",

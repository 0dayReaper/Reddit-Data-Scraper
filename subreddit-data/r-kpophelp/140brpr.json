Their concept focuses on \"growing up\", but with a slightly dreamy or whimsical touch. I think songs like Can't You See Me, Run Away or Blue Hours could fit (younger maybe?) SHINee as well.\nPlus Taehyun is a huge SHINee fanboy (watch him interview Taemin who is \"like a god\" to him, it's very cute). They have also covered a few SHINee songs (Replay and Sherlock I think), these are very nice performances.\n\nAlso, BoyNextDoor debuted recently with a song and concept that reminds me a lot of Replay, if you're nostaligc for some old school SHINee :)",

Idk if they\u2019re necessarily that similar but they\u2019re worth checking out imo! Especially if you like vocal heavy kpop music which I\u2019m assuming you do since you like SHINee? BTOB\u2019s music is probably the most similar to SHINee\u2019s music out if the two.",

They just sound perfect together as a group. \n\nOther's have said what I would suggest for something that comes close.  Infinite...and lately TXT has been giving me a mix of SHINee and BTS vibes.  \n\nTeen Top might satisfy the wait for the new album.  No More Perfume on you has an 80's synth vibe like a lot of SHINee's bops.  \n\nBDC comes close.

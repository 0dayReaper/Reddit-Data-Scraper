    "postText": "I see a lot of giveaways on social media for a month bubble subscription, and they do receive genuine proof from the winners of the subscription. I can't seem to find a way to do this, but I'd like to gift some to a few people. Or maybe they're just sending the winners the price of the month? But they don't seem to say this anywhere in their posts or winner announcements.",

Like not within fandoms but like in the kpop community as a whole?\nI am NOT talking about the most popular overall (stuff like dynamite by BTS). \n\nSurely there is no one right answer to this question but I\u2018m still curious if there is a general consensus on this.",

The progression of SNSD choruses from 1-&gt;3 is always lovely to listen to, and they have some really nice lives of the song \ud83d\ude0a It\u2019s also pretty surprising because Genie is a more mature sound and look that came right after their massive bubblegum hit Gee. It\u2019d be like Twice releasing Cheer Up and then ICSM or something instead of TT.",

The vocals are impressive (RIP Jonghyun) and the song doesn't try hard to be cool it just is.  It captures a strong sense of what it's like being a young kid in love and I think so many people relate to that on so many levels.  I think this kind of formula works and is evident more recently in New Jeans songs.  It feels like if New Jeans came out during the 2nd Gen, their songs would've sounded a lot like Replay.",

I think newer fans really underestimate his value and legacy. Psy's songs always chart well in South Korea. I'm not even a particular fan but I've watched his concerts in South Korea and it's crazy how the crowd gets into it. He's not a typical kpop idol but a lot of kpop would not be where it is without him and idols know it and like his music too.",

Also some listen to Egotistic by mmm without being very interested in their other songs or even knowing it was mmm who sung it at all (I was going through my Spotify the other day and my friend was like oh Mamamoo sung that?? Lmfao). Egotistic, Gogobebe, and their other title tracks are bops and were pretty popular when they first came out but I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re that kind of \u201cuniversally known and liked\u201d\n\nMy point was if ppl can recognise and know a song without necessarily knowing much about the artist then I\u2019d say it\u2019s a pretty well known and popular song. Like I can recognise a few blackpink songs when I hear them even tho idk squat about them",

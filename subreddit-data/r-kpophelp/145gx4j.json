You can see on desktop that they have the same number of total plays on both the single version and their later appearance in the album. \n\nSpotify wrapped is very easy to mess up on accident though (such as accidentally leaving a song on loop) so if you care a lot about these particulars (and want every month to count towards your end of year score) I'd suggest starting to use an external scrobble tracking website such as [Lastfm](https://www.last.fm/home) where you can see much more detailed breakdowns of your listening habits and delete any accidental or fake plays. If you're already using Spotify you'll be able to set up an account and start tracking very easily! I highly recommend.",

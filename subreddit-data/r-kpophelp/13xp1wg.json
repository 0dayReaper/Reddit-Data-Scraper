I would recommend songs by them like Utopia or Halazia maybe. Their debut album\u2019s title track was Pirate King and the entire concept for the album was pirates (the leader of the group goes by captain \ud83d\ude06). May not be exactly what you\u2019re looking for but you should def check them out!",

            "comment": "He has literally been my ult bias and my role model as a dancer and person for years now. He is everything I aspired to be. I'm at such a loss right now and I genuinely have no idea what to do with myself or where to go from here. Dance has been my passion for so long and he's been the singularly biggest influence on it that it feels surreal to believe this has happened. It feels like I'm genuinely losing....not a friend, since I dont really want it to start sounding like I'm trying to equate what I feel to those he knew, but someone who played a huge role in my life none-the-less. \n\nI dont even want to think about where I'll go with dance. I dont plan on stopping but it's going to feel so strange continuing without him if that makes sense. I genuinely cannot stress how big a role he played in making me the dancer I am. I never wanted to emulate him but he's the basis for my entire style and I've never felt such a connection to a dancer before. Not in the personal sense but more of a \"This is exactly how I want to dance\" and I always hoped my dancing could one day make something feel the same thing. He's just had such a profound effect on my entire career that I'm just at a complete loss of what to do or where to go. I dont doubt I'll figure it out but I just don't know when or how.\n\n\nI know this sounds horrible and it's what everyone says when they lose someone they loved, but I keep thinking \"why him of all people?\" I don't wish this on any other idol or Fandom and I'm not trying to imply or say that. It just feels surreal that it's him that this happened to, you know? It's like you never really expect something bad like this to happen to someone you like or love. You kind of expect to be able to see them and be able to keep seeing them. It sounds kind of strange, but it's just venting and trying to process all of this.",

No matter the many comforts and positivity K-pop and idols gives to us fans, I hope we realize there's more to it behind the scenes. I hope for everyone to able to find the support they need in dark times, because there will always be someone to listen and support you.\n\nBut to bring some light and positivity, Moonbin was definitely a charming performer, singer, and always an amazing member of Astro. He was such a great performer, I was always mesmerized by his stage presence. May he rest in peace.",

I try to not get too immersed into Kpop idols' personal lives, and follow news of them closely because I have my own busy life. Moonbin was really precious to me, he is the true definitely of a bias wrecker in my journey as a fan. I missed the chance to see him in my city last year because I was stingy, and had other life committments. And it'll be one of my biggest regrets of 2022. \n\nThis is like the news of Jonghyun all over again, on that night I was coming home on the train after a date with my boyfriend. I basically got home, curled in bed all night sobbing. I travelled 1.5 hours to my city's memorial tribute to him a week later. I never forget that day. \n\nNow, I'm currently getting ready to go to the office, and I'm holding back tears.",

I'm quite a level headed person, but this was too early to be saying this to me, so I'm even more hurt. \n\nAs someone who's the same age as him (we're both '98 kids), and someone who I've been supporting for a long time (even if I'm not on top of everything he does, or have met him in person), this hits really close to home.",

Not even a year after he debuted he [told fans](http://astroseasons.blogspot.com/2017/01/fancafe-170122-moonbins-letter.html) he had been struggling with feelings of worthlessness and negativity. He'd bring up things every now and then that made me [worried about him](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/ay6lu2/astro_reveals_concerns_and_hopes_about_their/ehynha3/) but still I didn't expect to be here saying this today.

I think I'm in a better place mentally than I was back then but I also want to be considerate of people who may be more sensitive to these things right now so I thank you for this thread... I don't wanna go posting in the main thread on r/kpop right now. \n\nMoonbin was really my favorite idol probably ever. I liked them since Breathless. So during their rookie year. I wasn't lucky enough to catch them predebut, but I was very close haha. I liked Moonbin for a lot of reasons, he was so cute and funny, danced well, and I think at the core of it all he seemed like a very caring person. I guess even his long term friends he had in the industry would back those claims up. I also liked that he was born in 98, which was the same year as me. In fact our birthdays are very close as well! For almost 7 years now he's been my ultimate. When Jonghyun died, I was really broken. I knew Jonghyun and I liked him, but he wasn't special to me and I still reacted that way. Moonbin was such a special little gem to me, he was so precious. \n\nI didn't want to get too attached, parasocial relationships are a hot button topic right now, so I thought I had a healthy distance between us. But how could I not feel sad right now. I have all these memories of him just being sweet and lively. I remember him saying Rocky was his best friend, how they were \"closer than friends, we're brothers.\" I remember his favorite song was If I Die Tomorrow by Beenzino. I remember how long he waited for his little sister to debut, how he would remind us and mention her whenever he could, even on Running Man. I remember his silly little baby pictures and videos. I remember being so happy for him. I remember what a big BTS fanboy he was, he wanted to be friends with Jungkook if I remember correctly. I remember when Jonghyun died, the first thing to make me happy again afterwards was Astro performing a Christmas medley at the end of the year. They were so cute and bright and cheerful. I remember thinking that life goes on. \n\nI'm really going to miss him",

I watched the Moon\u2019s sibling contents. Sua is a fierce girl on stage but becomes a baby when she is with his brother. I can\u2019t imagine how hard this is for her. I won\u2019t mind her taking a break for a long time. \n\nMoonbin\u2019s smile is really bright. He is so young, I\u2019m older than him by a year. \n\nI just wanna share this. First of all, I respect the family\u2019s decision to not publicize the cause. But when I read the assumption from the police that it was suicide, I was like \u201cWhy did he do that?!\u201d\nI keep on asking myself why he took his life, of course, assuming that it was true. The funny thing is, I\u2019ve been contemplating or thinking of taking my own life for months, and maybe if I do it, other people would also ask themselves the same question; \u201cWhy did he do that?!\u201d \n\nThe hardest battle is against yourself. I\u2019m praying that someday, I could stop thinking about doing it. Always check on your loved ones. We don't know how much they need that simple talk from you. We don't know what\u2019s behind their bright smiles. To the fans, please, idols are humans, too. They have feelings, we don't own them. Hating on someone doesn't do you any better.\n\nI\u2019m with Moonbin\u2019s friends, fans, and family, especially Sua. We are all in this together. To OP, we can get through this.

Every predebut video they put out I would excitedly watch and every new album that came out I would happily dance around my room to. They were my favorite group, my everything, people who gave me comfort and love that I had trouble finding during those years. Moonbin was someone who I admired for his hard work, his ability to shine on stage and most of all I truly cared for his happiness. He was my ultimate bias during those days and I remember every night before bed wishing my Twitter mutuals a good night with a cute gif of him waving goodbye to go to bed as well. I remember seeing Astro the first time they came to the US and being so excited for the day I would be able to see them in person again. I was devastated with their hiatus and anxious to see their return. \n\nI was so happy they were able to find success even if I was not a hardcore aroha anymore. I would always look back fondly on their first few EPs with so much love. I would get drunk with my friends and make them watch their performances with their happy and refreshing songs, singing along while all my friends giggled at how excited and happy I was. How could I not be? Their music brought me so much joy and reminded me there were always happy times even if the world surrounding me was bleak. I could turn to their music to remind me of happiness. I could look at all the members and truly cheer for them, their happiness and their success. I wanted nothing more than to see them succeed and sure enough they were able to make themselves an even bigger group after their hiatus through their efforts and talents.\n\nMoonbin, thank you for the memories you were able to give me and the happiness I\u2019ll always feel while listening to Astro\u2019s music. You\u2019ll shine brightly to me forever and I truly hope you\u2019re in a softer place now, one that will fill you with happiness too. As a fan, it\u2019s a difficult feeling to navigate as I didn\u2019t truly know him, but there exists a love that is special between fan and singer. I\u2019m sure if you\u2019re reading this now you\u2019ll understand what I mean. Moonbin, I\u2019ll cherish you forever, and as I continue to grow I\u2019ll continue to thank you for the brightness you were able to add to my life. Thank you.",

I was never an AROHA, but I could see his talent in dancing and how much he loved to be in stage (at least what I saw as a non fan). The last contents I saw of him was his appearence in Running Man, his collab with his sister (Moon Sua) and his OMG and Tiger Inside cover. All in different times, but I found him so cute and endearing. I knew almost nothing about him, the one thing I knew is that he was a smiley person (like a sunshine).\n\nI think I still can't believe that this really happened. I can't even imagine what his family, members and friends are feeling right now. I just hope all of them can receive the best emotional support right now. My heart aches for his fans too, 'cause I also can't imagine losing someone I admire as a fan. \n\nMy deepest condolences to everyone.\n\nRIP Moonbin",

It's so hollowing and surreal that this all has happened. \n\nThey haven't said anything but I'm sure the boys are not taking this the greatest either.

I hope she understands this isn't her fault and there is probably nothing she could have done. \n\nThis seems to have happened out of nowhere, Fantagio is known for mistreating idols and trainees even behind the scenes so I'm sure I can make a few guess, but I can't help to wonder what caused such an action.... he must have struggled greatly.",

I hadn\u2019t been listening to them much because it made me miss MJ when he enlisted. Then Rocky didn\u2019t renew and it was difficult to listen to kpop at all. Now\u2026 I don\u2019t even know how to feel or what I\u2019ll do. \n\nMoonbin was a top notch performer. Absolutely electrifying. And I loved all of his antics. He did and said whatever he wanted. I remember when Billlie debuted, and he was asking aroha what he needed to do to get into their fancall because he wanted to see his sister. I just thought it was so sweet. He was such a caring person. I hope he\u2019s at peace. And I hope his parents, sua, astro, their staff, and his friends and colleagues get the support they need during this time.",

As usual, when I see news like this, I hope it is a d**** hoax despite that really being a thing anymore. Instant tears, and every time I remember, it makes me feel sick. I really hope all his family and friends will have each other to lean on. Something like this happened a few months ago when Twitch, a famous dancer, passed. He seemed fine. He had plans on having another baby with his wife. Then, next thing, the reports came out that he was gone. I understand personally how it is to seem fine to everyone and hide the pain when everyone is looking, but every time something happens, I'm left like... who could have saved you despite not wanting to be saved. Either way, it is very unfortunate that the world lost such a great person, but I hope the final moments were with peace. It breaks my heart to be writing this, and the tears are back. I hope everyone affected by this is about to heal with time. I wish you all the best \ud83d\udc95",

His energy, talent and enthusiasm immediately drew me in. Not to mention how handsome he is. My heart melted when he smiled. I saw the announcement literally as soon as I woke up today. If felt like I was having a nightmare. I\u2019ve been crying on and off all day long, but it\u2019s hard because I have to be at work. Whenever I see one of my cats I start crying because her name easily rhymes with the chorus of Candy Sugar Pop so I always sing it to her. I\u2019ve also been in a really bad headspace with my mental illness lately and I\u2019ve had thoughts of not wanting to continue living (I\u2019m OK though, I\u2019m not going to do anything, so please don\u2019t send Reddit cares to me). It\u2019s hitting SO close to home. This is such a weird experience because I feel bad that I\u2019m feeling so affected even though I didn\u2019t know him as much as arohas and obviously not as much as his family. members and friends. I don\u2019t know how to process this grief. My heart is just broken.",

I'm just a fan, I live on the other side of the world, and while I was lucky enough to see him live on stage, he never even knew I existed, and yet I'm so shocked and hurt. ASTRO have helped me through hard times and brought me so many smiles and laughs and happy moments. I owe Moonbin many thanks for that.\n\nI always looked up to him, despite being older and watching him grow through the years, cause he seemed to be such a cheerful, bright and kind person. He seemed like a person I would've wanted as a friend, like a person I would've wanted to be. \n\nWe always say how these idols are so far away, so out of reach, most of us never get to meet them or to interact with them.. it's unbelievable how much someone can still mean to you despite that distance. I was in shock when I read the news, I had almost no other emotion than \"oh!?\" but now I haven't stopped crying for the past 30 minutes, and I'm just so sad... make sure to take care of yourselves everyone, get some sleep, get some water... go hug your pets or talk to a relative or a friend if this news is hurting you.

It wasn't until I saw Fantagio's statement that it sunk in and I cried.\n\nAstro was the 2nd kpop group I really got into after BTS, mostly because of compilations of them being fans;; I ended up being more of a casual fan as I sunk deeper into Kpop and Kdramas, but Astro was always a part of my journey. I always listened to at least their group title tracks, their sub-units, and all the dramas they took part in.\n\nI remember watching To Be Continued and falling for Rocky and Moonbin, mostly because I was really into dancers at the time. I later ulted Seventeen and ult biased Seungkwan in particular, who was part of the 98z group with Moonbin.\n\nNow I ended up mostly being a casual aroha, but I know there is so much more to Moonbin than just a reminder to be kind. He was always so funny and sweet whenever I saw him. I remember feeling jealous and wishing I had a friend like him. He's an incredibly talented person, who from what I could tell was a complete ace. Not just singing, dancing, or performing, but his acting was good too. A real jack-of-all trades, a complete charmer, he was meant to be famous.\n\nA while back I was shocked and sad to find out Rocky left Astro, this is the worst possible news anyone could ever get. I wish we could've had many more years with him, as a celebrity or otherwise. I know he deserved so much more, I'm distraught thinking about all the people that truly know and love him. \n\nPlease, I really hope Kpop fans have some morals and dignity regarding his passing.",

So I didn't know why I was deeply hurt when I saw the news of his passing. I've never really been too emotionally involved with kpop unless its about being happy with the music and the people.\n\nBut last night I was crying until like 2am. And when I woke up, I didnt eat nor drink and then did laundry like a crazy person until I wore myself out. \n\nI am tired. But i feel a little better. There's somewhat of a void inside. I dont know why Moonbin affected me this much, but he did. Now I'm saving all his pictures just to see his smile. I have never saved a single pic of him before. I know i sound stupid when I say this but it feels like he's a special person in my personal life that I lost?\n\nBut I know i will get better. And we will get better. I remember I watched somewhere where they explained that a loss of a loved one can be described as a ball bouncing inside a box with a red button on one of the sides. The button is your pain. Sometimes the ball is big and every bounce will hit the big red button, and it will hurt every time. But eventually the ball gets smaller so it will hit less, but it doesnt mean the pain is less. But at least you can function.\n\nSending hugs to all arohas and all the people who love Moonbin.",

The fact that he is no more just hurts me so much. I am not an Aroha, but after watching Moment of Eighteen I was intrigued by his acting and looked him up and he became one of my favorites in no time. Moonbin was an all-round perfect talent. His personality and the way he was just fun and free warmed my heart.\n\nWhen my friend asked me if I was an Aroha yesterday I just thought nothing of it, when she relayed the news I stopped functioning since then every thought takes me back to his smile and beaming presence.\n\nEvery time I see his picture or watch his content my heart hurts and impossible wishful thoughts flood my head, maybe he'll be back and whatnot. I'm a training doctor, I know very well that this makes no sense but my thoughts aren't straight, even now I wish with all my heart that this is some sick twisted joke and had just come back, I'm wishing for a miracle.\n\nDigesting the fact that he is no more is easy, accepting this cruelty of the universe is tedious. I keep reminding myself that I don't know this person and this is just his persona but it's easier said than done, I truly feel like I've lost a good talented friend.\n\nI know he is happy and healthy in the skies now and I hope all our wishes and love reach him. If miracles exist then I wish for him to be born again and share his light and positivity with the world and I hope he spreads his energy again. I want to experience his charismatic presence again no matter how long it takes.\n\nThe only consolation is that I am just a fan and to me, he will exist forever as he did on the internet, I will bask in his light whenever I want to. To me, he is still the old Moonbin just on a long break.\n\nYou did beyond amazing, your life gave hope and energy to fans.\n\nI love you Moonbin. I will continue to love you.\n\nRIP.",

            "comment": "i started stanning astro when I first got until kpop which was around 2018ish. I loved their vibe, their music, the way they danced, etc. although sanha was my bias, they were all my favorites in so many different ways. Moonbin had always stuck out to me the most for his amazing smile, his gentleness, his humor and his spectacular dancing skills. I would be lying if I said that i kept up with them 24/7 but I made sure to be there rooting for them for every comeback they had. When Moonbin and Sanha came out as a subunit, i tried to keep with them more following their journey as a subunit for the time being and enjoying their amazing music. His stage presence was unmatched, the way he hit every note and move during his performance was truly mesmerizing. \n\nI feel so upset that I won\u2019t be able to hear from this smiling angel anymore. He deserved and continues to deserves so much more than what the world offered him. He truly was light in this world, and the world got a little darker today with him leaving us. I hope he finds the peace that he sought, and although I will along with his family and friends, and those who loved him, will truly miss him, his impact that he left on the world will never leave us. \n\nmoonbin, you did an amazing job. no one can ever take away the blood, sweat and tears that you put into everything that you did during your time on earth. may you rest in peace. if I see a star that shines brighter than the others tonight, i know that\u2019s you. \ud83e\udd0d",

            "comment": "I gasped. I just woke up and saw this post and I thought \u2018oh no, did he get into a scandal and now people are accusing him of something?\u2019. But then I read more comments and just found out that he passed away... Maybe that\u2019s why I woke up today and strangely felt more fear for some reason. I was going to click on the boys planet voting thing but accidentally clicked on reddit instead and ended up seeing this. I think I\u2019m still in a state of shock, I can\u2019t believe it. I offer my condolences to his family, members, friends and other Arohas. I don\u2019t know what to feel, it\u2019s kind of hard to breathe right now tbh. \n\nThe first image that popped into my mind was his face when I first saw and watched him in \u2018boys over flowers\u2019 and his smile. I still remember watching Astros debut with hide and seek and being impressed by their dance practice and thinking \u201che looks familiar\u201d and searching them up to read about them. And I still remember clicking on their mv\u2019s every time they had a comeback, and I would sincerely wish for their success and for more fans to know and love them. And was so happy when more people started to know them more after \u2018baby\u2019. Ah, his voice in \u2018baby\u2019 when he sang the chorus rings in my head. I still remember the soda bottles in \u2018Breathless\u2019 and laughing because of how cute and fun it was, his cover of \u2018Butterfly\u2019, seeing their concept change and mature, their first win, seeing them expand to do other things\u2026 I can\u2019t help but cry even though I didn\u2019t know him personally in real life. And I worry for those whose mental health is impacted by this news, especially those who suffer depression and other mental health struggles like me who\u2019s thinking \u201cwhat\u2019s the point anymore\u201d. I hope whoever\u2019s struggling reach out for help and comfort. I don\u2019t think I can look at or listen to kpop comfortably for a while. I tried listening to one of their songs again but I ended up in a weird mix of crying and then not crying/feeling as bad because the songs and Moonbins smile is healing, and then crying again. I jump around between from wanting to see and listen to them and him, to not wanting to look in that direction at all. I feel extremely complicated. And it doesn\u2019t really feel like I have the right to even feel this way, I\u2019m restricted to just being a fan after all and haven\u2019t even gotten a chance to see them live on stage or anything.\n\nIt\u2019s strange because my relationship with him as a fan and artist is a little different from the other groups and artists I enjoy. Like I saw him every step of the way from when he was a kid- even when I wasn\u2019t familiar and as big of a fan yet or when I didn\u2019t stan them as hard anymore, I still clicked on them whenever they were recommended and listened to their comebacks, recommended their songs to friends and feeling proud and excited that they were getting exposure. Unlike with others, I strangely remembered every new moment and my reaction to them clearly, like what I thought and felt. Like I remember every reaction of mine when I watched and listened to each new release, and seeing them try acting, MC-ing and other things. \n\nHe was my bias in Astro. I just listened to their songs yesterday, I can still hear his voice in my head. I didn\u2019t expect this news at all, Now I really wish it was just a stupid scandal instead\u2026 \n\nI really wish it was just a stupid scandal.",

It would be hell. It\u2019s my worst nightmare to lose my big brother. They\u2019re supposed to be your friend to the end. I think that\u2019s what makes it so hard. You are always somewhat prepared for the fact that your parents will eventually pass but your sibling is supposed to be with you until the end. And for him to die so young and with so much talent is a tragedy. It haunts me to think of how dark of a place he had to be in. \n\nI don\u2019t want this to define him even though I know it will. What I\u2019d hope for people to remember is that this was one day in Moonbin\u2019s life. He had 25 years of other experiences and life lived. As someone who\u2019s been in a very dark place I hope to comfort others by saying that even when someone commits suicide it doesn\u2019t mean they were sad every day. It doesn\u2019t mean that every memory and smile was fake. I\u2019m 100% sure that Moonbin had great days full of genuine laughter in his life.",

I didn\u2019t really know any of the members or songs, only heard the group name. Still this is incredibly horrible and tragic news. My friend sendt me the article and we were both kind of speechless. \n\n\u00abPlease, not again\u00bb was my first thought. Although I know I cannot compare this loss to what his closest circle might feel or his fans, I know after the death of other idols I truely looked up to made me feel. It is not only a tough time, but also weird knowing on a baseline that we will never see them again. I mean, even if we do not know them, we still form parasocial relationships to these idols in some form that make them an important presence in our lives, directly or indirectly. \n\nMy condolences to his family, friends, group members and fans. I know this is tough, even if we don\u2019t know him as a person, news like this will always be tragic. \n\nI also hope, but sadly doubt, that kpop companies will take mental and physical health more seriously. I can only assume this was a suicide based on reports There has been too many k-pop idols death\u2019s these last few years. It\u2019s tragic. It\u2019s not something they should just mourn for a few months and then move on to being just as cold and brutal in the industry. I know, realistically things won\u2019t change, but I have some blind hope that one day it will. \n\nAnd it starts with the fans. Stop putting idols on pedestals. Stop scrutinizing their every move. Stop thinking everything you say and do is ok just because they are famous. Of course you are allowed to not like somebody - there are many idols I do not like, but just\u2026 be nicer. The world needs more kindness now than ever. \n\nAlso, as somebody who themselves struggle with mental health and suicidal thoughts. PLEASE reach out to somebody. Therapy, emergency helplines, friends, family, anybody you trust.",

Most traumatizing was the treatment of Jonghyun. Memes were coming out of his funeral picture, people capitalized on the member\u2019s pain, and news companies were ruthless. The things said by people were disgusting. We had mass amounts of fans planning to commit suicide. I knew hundreds who lost the will to live. That was a dark dark dark time for me and Shinee world. And recently, I face this again. Now I lose Moonbin, another member of a favorite group. I mention Jonghyun because I want you fellow fans to know that you will face very tough photos, videos, comments, treatment, and more. I have already seen many disgusting videos and jokes. People who never knew Moonbin will make edits or statements claiming things when they never knew him. It is okay to be angry. It is okay to grieve. It is okay to be sad. You are justified in all your emotions. Sadly, most people will use Moonbin as a face to talk about the problems in K-pop. Let us ignore that and celebrate Moonbin as a person. He was not just an idol. He was a son. A brother. A friend. He had the most beautiful smile. He loved all of us and worked so hard to try his best. Although many of us only saw him through a computer screen, he impacted many of our lives. He made our day better. He made us smile. He made us laugh. Do not let anyone say you should not feel this way. I want to end with a poem I wrote saying farewell to Jonghyun back in 2017. To Moonbin, may you go in peace.

When I first found out the news, I was scrolling Quora, I thought it was a joke then I used google search. My first reaction was no, no, no and I let out a high pitched noise then I started balling my eyes out for the next 20-30 minutes and shaking. ASTRO was the first K-pop group I got into that was only last year and their music came at a time when I felt like I was going through a state of limbo, there was so bubbly and uplifting that it always made me happy. I will always remember when I saw Moonbin and Sanha at the Hallyu Pop Fest in London 2022. He seemed so happy and lit up the stage and he was so interactive with fans, he was a really talented and genuinely kind and caring person. I will try to remember him this way to honour him, I\u2019ve stop crying but the tears are coming and going. I feel weirdly numb yet devastated at the same time. I\u2019m really unsure what to do with myself at the moment.\n\nAs I\u2019ve put my deep sympathies go out to everyone who knew him.",

Also when I start listening to K-Pop didn't know much about SHINee but now I love everything about them and now all the Shawol family are suffering from the wounds they have about losing Jonghyun.

And on the other side I'm angry... angry at this world where we need to hold couple witnesses to start taking action. We live under poor paradigms and foolish me to think that this society is leading somewhere healthy and organic. May moonbin is in peaceful place now. I may not be aroha or any fandom but i grieve the loss with you all.",

I\u2019m very frustrated with the situation as much as I am devastated. I\u2019ve never mourned like this for a celebrity.\n\nThe most frustrating part about this are the people on social media seeking clout from his death. I know we all mourn differently but I can\u2019t not stand seeing those reaction videos about his death. They don\u2019t sit well with me. They cover their mouth like \u201comg I\u2019m so shocked\u201d, just say your condolences and move a long if he didn\u2019t mean anything to you. \n\nI don\u2019t need to write paragraphs or post videos of me crying to prove how much he meant to me, I just deeply wish he knew the dynamic of his existence and how embedded he was in my/our hearts.",

We yet again couldn't protect another sunshine. We really don't know what goes on behind the camera what he hid behind that smile. We just throw hate but they are celebs who are human beings with emotions like everyone of us.\n\nI've looked up to him ever since I found astro and i became an aroha. I just hope Sanha and Sua and his family members and astro members his friends us fans will recover what can I even say more. Let's just hear his songs his beautiful vocals his dance his beautiful smile.\n\nEveryone of you who are suffering now please seek help it's my request as a fellow kpop fan fellow redditor a stranger. Nobody knows what you're going through",

They were my first, and I\u2019ve genuinely loved each one of them for years (since 1/1/2018 to be exact). \n\nHe wasn\u2019t ever my bias, but he made me laugh and I did, and do, and will forever, love him. I was 14 and realising that I was in an abuse home environment and ASTRO and Moonbin helped me stay alive and be happy. They gave me the strength to convince my mom to kick out our abuser. They mean so much to me.\n\nA part of me still can\u2019t believe it- can\u2019t believe that there\u2019ll never be another day with him physically here.\nHe didn\u2019t know me, and I didn\u2019t know him really, but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t love him any less.\n\n Also, I hope that people will stop speculating and speaking on his cause of death. It\u2019s not been announced yet, and I\u2019m not even sure they have it as it\u2019s been less than 24hrs and autopsies take some time. It feels very disrespectful to his family and to him to assume that it was what people are assuming based only on the word of a singular officer who said that they are looking into it as a /possibility/. \n\nI hope his soul is resting peacefully now.",

Every time I thought I was okay the tears came flooding back. I cried in the dining hall, in the bathroom, in class, on the bus home, at a meeting I had. Usually I can control my tears, especially in public, but I just couldn\u2019t today. \n\nI think it might be the fear/reality that this can happen to people who seem so happy (and the fact that it has happened way too many times before). I haven\u2019t smiled since I saw the news. \n\nI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not gonna be able to listen to any Astro songs for a while without crying and I just want everything kpop related to be put on hold (i.e., boys planet finale, seventeen comeback, WOODZ comeback, etc.) for a while cause I don\u2019t think I can handle everything. \n\nIt just feels wrong to be happy when something so horrible has happened. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how his family, friends, and members feel right now :(",

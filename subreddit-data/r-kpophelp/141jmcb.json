    "postText": "So HBO\u2019s the Idol premiered last night, and there\u2019s been a lot of talk in recent week and even months about how much seggs, dorgs &amp; rock n roll is in the show, and the general talk is that it\u2019s all pretty scandalous. Haven\u2019t seen it myself (at least as of yet). \n\nOf course, Jennie from Blackpink is in the cast - it\u2019s her first acting job, and she went to Cannes for it so it must have at least made the news there. \n\nNow the first episode\u2019s out, does anyone know if there has been any talk in Korea about the controversy around the show, and the fact Jennie is connected to it?",

            "comment": "The comments on [this post](https://www.pannchoa.com/2023/06/theqoo-us-drama-idol-scenes-with-jennie.html) are not too enthused about the show itself, which is expected considering that's how international audiences have reacted as well. On [this other post](https://www.pannchoa.com/2023/06/enter-talk-its-such-waste-for-jennie-to.html) people are defending Jennie from people criticizing her for the scenes with the male dancers:\n\n&gt;1. \\[+164, -44\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The kids who are hating on Jennie for this, get in your right mind. Jennie is playing the role of a dancer here and she's not dancing like this in her actual solo stage. Please separate drama from reality a bit..\u314b\u314b  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. \\[+151, -41\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Glory had all sorts of scenes from s\\*x scenes to assa\\*lt scenes but Pann-girls have never hated on the actors? Jennie is just playing the role of a dancer here. You can feel shocked but don't hate on Jennie  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. \\[+132, -28\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Do the kids who are hating and making s\\*xual remarks on Jennie right now understand that they are doing that to the actress in the drama?\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b know how to differentiate fiction from reality a bit  \n&gt;  \n&gt;4. \\[+132, -35\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;People are not hating on Jennie because of it\u3147\u3147 I can understand criticizing the drama, but calling Jennie names is just plain stupid  \n&gt;  \n&gt;5. \\[+110, -24\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I agree that the dance sucks but the kids hating and making s\\*xual jokes on Jennie right now are nothing more than hate commentors\n\nFrom what I've seen it seems that while the show is not being well-received she's not getting too much criticism, but of course these two posts are not reflective of knetz's general opinions. Translation accs can be selective with the posts they choose to share so I'd take it with a grain of salt.",

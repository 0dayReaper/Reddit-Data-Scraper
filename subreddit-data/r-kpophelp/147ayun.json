    "postText": "Let's say both groups have massive fanbases. Why might one vocalist be popular while another vocalist is underrated? I notice some vocalists get a lot of attention for their vocals and have many fans while other vocalists are unpopular. Is the difference looks? Personality? Charisma? Again both groups have massive fanbases so it's not a matter of any group getting less publicity.",

It could be looks (highly likely), character, fanbase mentality, marketing, what their career trajectories have been like, if they stand out as a stan attractor in their group, etc. For the vocals themselves it could be vocal colour, style, or solo music preference.\n\nThe only similarities they share are their vocalist positions and the fact that they are in a popular group. That is pretty much it.",

Its kinda unpredictable in lots of cases.\n\nYou see all those castings in those companies, even they missjudge the potential popularity of some talents. Its not that easy and it involves lots of lucky events.",

            "comment": "i guess just like the other commenters said, charisma and looks end up playing a huge role in this aspect, other than that all i can think abt is the opportunity the idols in question have to showcase their talent, and sometimes things like this eventually end up happening even inside the own group tbh. As a kep1er fan ik that the group isnt in its peak of popularity or whatever but Chaehyun is very much praised for her vocal skills (as she should be) but its a shame that even Kep1ians themselves wont acknowlege members like Yujin or even Bahiyyih for example when it comes to that.",

But they are still aware they're on camera, and that they are making some show/promotion to be broadcast to fans, so I'm sure there is some aspect of their mentality that is still in \"work mode\" during most or all of their time filming that.",

            "comment": "It's definitely a long time to be on camera, but I doubt it ever feels all that private for them. It seems like they're very aware of their on camera vs. off camera time. For BTS specifically, I know there were parts of their documentaries where they very clearly chose to turn the cameras off, and there's parts that are heavily edited.\n\nBut it's also just very much what idols sign up for, so they probably get used to it quick. I don't know if this is in his contract, I don't think it is, but Chris from Stray Kids does long lives every week. He shares some pretty personal stuff during it sometimes. For him to do that outside of official content makes me think there's a much higher feeling of friendship (? Idk if that's the right word) on the side of idols than is usual for celebrities. If the chats were nice and consistent enough, I'd probably feel the same in their place.",

Variety yes, but Korean reality seems a lot more laid back and relaxed. More \u201cslice of life\u201d kinda feel.",

            "comment": "&gt; do idols really feel so close to their fans or is it an act? i mean do you think they actually let their guard down or do they actively try to keep to the appropriate amount of sincerity \n\nYeah, like others, I think it's a mix of both. Also, this is THEIR job. I think this is something a lot of fans don't realize when they tell companies these people need rest, that this is literally their job. Based on comments I see online, a lot of fans talk about their workload more like parents forcing their children to study too much or engage in too may extracurricular activities. Not that the concern isn't completely unwarranted. Likewise, I might think a pro tennis player or an athlete on a premier league team might have to take it easy, but it's their job. \n\nBut, yeah, idols know what they're getting into. Same with a lot of public figures. If you run for office in America, prepare for everything in your past to pop up. It comes with the job. I think that's why now it seems like companies put such an emphasis on getting smart, honorable idols, because this kind of behind the scenes content is integral to long term success. So it's just easier to get members who are cool and like each other. Only so long they can fake it. For better or worse, a lot of fans see idols as their dream besties. Idols who are good at this kind of content are a huge asset.",

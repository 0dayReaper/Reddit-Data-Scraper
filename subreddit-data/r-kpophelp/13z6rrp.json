    "postText": "HI! I am looking for a popular korean song sang by a female soloist and released in the late 2010s (2017,2018,2019). I remember having heard it on a korean tv show being covered, I thought it was on th e Fan on SBS but I was wrong. The song was pretty famous at the time in korea. I remember the word \"Lausanne\" or something that sounded like it being included in the title or perhaps the lyrics OR perhaps it was another french sounding word with \"-anne\" being included in the lyrics, title or the name of the artist. Also the song was sad, something about love or solitude/loneliness. I remember having found the mv, and it was set in dark room with candles I think, or the singer was in a dark room with candles sat alone at a table (??) and looked gloomy, she had maybe dress or night gown on. The singer was a korean female in her mid to late 20s or maybe even 30s (she was not that young). \n\nThank u",

Plus she was in her emotional ballad song phase for 2017-2020 (Rescue, Stable Mindset and Unstable Mindset albums).\n\nI dont recall tables or \"-anne\" but she sure did sit in plenty of dark rooms lmao.\n\nNightgown could be \"Dark Cloud\", Candles could be \"What Does My Heart Become\", and maybe also check out \"Rainy Day\".",

Still! Thank u for ur help",

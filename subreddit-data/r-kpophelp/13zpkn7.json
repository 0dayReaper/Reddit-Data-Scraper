            "comment": "Honestly with June just starting it\u2019s crazy looking back at what the K-pop scenes already brought. In no order here are some of my picks for the first half of the year:\n\nSTAYC - So k-fans definitely gave the girls their flowers for this comeback and it was well deserved. I know cute concepts aren\u2019t as well received by international fans, but STAYC proved that they keep the concept fresh, fun and interesting. Teddy Bear is a bop and a gem, period. Poppy getting it\u2019s Korean version as the B side is gold! Poppy is one of the few songs that translates so well in both Japanese and Korean. To cite another fave example is Mr. Taxi by SNSD it works for both versions.\n\nAespa - My stance on Aespa prior to the My World comeback we just had has been good. Now? I will proudly call myself a MY. Say what you want about Spicy itself, but this comeback the girls brought their A game and clearly had a blast performing Spicy, Thirsty, Salty &amp; Sweet, AND Welcome to My World. Aespa gets so much shit from people for every little thing. People like to talk about their visuals, but I wanna talk about their vocals, their stage presence, and their overall teamwork. These girls are the whole package and no one could ask for more. Also, for the record Spicy is a whole ass bop and it gives major top girl energy.\n\nBilllie - holy sh*t. It\u2019s crazy how talented these girls are. It\u2019s also crazy how f*cking good their music sounds. It merits all the swearing for joy and amazement. People might say EUNOIA\u2019s school girl concept is a trend and you might be right. You also might be missing out on the execution. There\u2019s something about girl groups getting to embrace the daily lives of a young girl and making that a concept worth raving for because it is everything. Girl groups deserve to love and represent who and what they are and where they come from and they showed that. Vocals, dance, rap, synergy, I mean you name it, they bring it! Also this whole mini? Like all their past albums there is something for everyone to enjoy. These girls do anything and everything like it\u2019s no big deal.\n\nWell those are 3 picks that I wanted to really talk about. Obviously NewJeans, IVE, LE SSERAFIM, Jisoo, Twice, NMIXX, tripleS, Fifty Fifty, (G)I-DLE and so many more female groups and solos really brought it! \n\nPS: My fave boygroup releases this year so far are Crazy Like That by VERIVERY, Macarena by BLITZERS, Super by Seventeen AND EVERY SINGLE SONG BY EVERY GROUP THAT WAS ON PEAKTIME, PERIOOOODDDD.\n\nI love K-pop! Byeeeeee! \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd",

It's kinda weird actually. \n\nI had been hearing about them for awhile because Joohoney of Monsta X was always jamming to Next Level. I finally checked them out when Welcome to MY World dropped and I'm so glad I did. That album is absolutely flawless. It's the perfect mix of ballads and bops with songs that are somewhere in the middle. Spicy, Salty &amp; Sweet and Thirsty are my literal theme songs. I would like them to play every time I walk into a room from now on \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. \n\nI also created some fun memories with aespa as I was in Seoul right after the album's release so they were my first Lucky Draw Event. I'll never forget pulling Karina &amp; Giselle and a local MY telling me she desparately needed the Giselle card so we traded and I got NingNing.",

Also sweet juice really allowed me to hear the nuances in Purple kisses voices.Cupid was amazing, and the the main singer(?) has such a calming voice. Billie Eunoia continued their indie- vibes and sounds I dont really see too often. Kard's Icky is great live, but I always favor once they get on tour because they'll be way more wild than on shows- which this song deserves. Monsta X always has my heart. And loved Lee chayeons Knock especially the last dance.",

Soyeon did it again!\n\nAnd these are just the major ones I was looking forward to, there have been so many other good releases this year that other people have listed here. 2022 was a historic year for 4th gen and I wasn't sure if maybe 2023 was going to be a letdown, but it's been great so far and we still have another 6 months.",

Not just the title track, but the whole mini was flawless! I hope kpop stans would keep an eye for TEMPEST because they\u2019ve been releasing bops ever since!\n\n2. \u2018Sugar Rush Ride\u2019 by TXT - TXT is also one of the groups that always gives flawless title tracks! Sugar Rush Ride was unique, in my opinion. It wasn\u2019t what I was expecting when the teasers was released, but then again, TXT managed to surprise me and surpass my expectations!\n\n3. \u2018Bite Me\u2019 by ENHYPEN - Wasn\u2019t a big fan of ENHYPEN\u2019s past releases so I honestly wasn\u2019t that excited for this comeback, but I was proven wrong! First listen to \u2018Bite Me\u2019 and I\u2019m instantly hooked! It has been on my \u2018on-repeat\u2019 playlist",

That EP blew me away. One thing I love about kpop that\u2019s missing in the Western market a lot is the fact that an artist often consists of multiple members thus you can do so much with the vocal element of the music. NMIXX and their producers have made such gorgeous sounds with their vocals, especially in the layered and stacked vocals. \n\nPOW! - Cherry Bullet - I\u2019m not really a CB gyal but this was second gen full on T-ara levels of ridiculous and camp and I loved it\n\nTricky House - xikers - it could\u2019ve done with a smidge longer cooking in the studio but it shows a lot of promise for xikers\u2019 music. I\u2019m not really an Ateez fan but I love their overall sound and I can\u2019t wait to see how the people producing at KQ develop and grow now that they have a new artist to cater to. Tricky House is a solid start, albeit very Ateez-sounding. \n\nWallflower - Twice\n\nChamomile by Team 23:00 from Peak Time\n\nI do! Do you? - Kep1er - exactly what they should\u2019ve been releasing from the start. Shame it\u2019s only a Japanese release because I think it would do well in Korea. She\u2019s clearly related to Up!, which is another song I think perfectly suits Kep1er. \n\nOMG - NewJeans",

            "comment": "It was Onew's comeback Circle. It had a huge impact on me. I remember that it came out it when I was in the school yard. When I first listened to it I was shaking, crying, my legs were so weak I had to sit down and I couldn't form a normal sentence. I was just screaming like ONEEEWWW COMEEBACK WAA..and that was the only thing I could say. After the song ended I was looking in the distance and I was walking back and forth for about 20 minutes. The funny thing is that I listened to it 5 times in a row at home and even after that I couldn't remember how it sounded like it was that shocking. Not only the music but also the MV made me cry. I physically cannot watch it again. I refuse to watch it again it's mentally demanding seeing what's happening on the screen. \nI don't listen to this song very often because it makes me feel so weird. It's too beautiful and everytime I hear it I drop tears. Me, a very stupid person successfully read the translation and oh bro i wish I didn't read it. I want to forget it it's too much to handle.\nBut guys don't get me wrong. I am in love with this song and I believe it's the ultimate song and no song can beat it. Circle \u2b55 is the God of Songs. The Holy Trinity is Lucifer, Sherlock and Ring Ding Dong. (but that's another question for another day).",

Masterpiece by Cravity \n7. Lights by Joohoney\n\nI liked all of these releases because not only are the title tracks amazing but the albums themselves are awesome. I think each of these albums is a press play album that you can listen to any time, day or night. I also think the sounds and styles are diverse. \n\nI'm excited because everyone on this list is from my favorites so I'm just really loving K-Pop in 2023. It feels so fresh and fun.",

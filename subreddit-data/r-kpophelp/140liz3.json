    "postText": "I didn't manage to get Agust D tickets for either of the Seoul shows. \n\nI've been checking global interpark multiple times a day because I know that when people cancel their tickets they get put back up for sale however, I'm not sure if this is a glitch but it keeps saying that there's a ticket available but when you click on the section where the seat is apparently available, there aren't any free seats.\n\nIs this a glitch? Or are people just getting the tickets faster than I am. The free seats are showing up in different sections, for example there was supposedly a VIP standing one available but when I clicked there was nothing, it did the same for seated tickets.\n\nI literally just need one ticket for myself, there are so many resellers on twitter but I was under the impression that the tickets weren't transferrable- especially since a lot of them were raffle tickets I'm not sure how reselling would even work.\n\nPlease help me haha I really want to go to this concert!",

            "comment": "You have higher chances of maybe getting a ticket the closer it is to the concert. For the first raffle, free cancellation period is already over, so most people won\u2019t cancel those anymore (as Interpark adds a 10%, 20% and 30% cancellation fee the closer it is to the show). For this round, free cancellations are also either over already or are about to be over, I\u2019m not sure. So all you can do is keep on checking Interpark.       \nIt\u2019s also not a glitch. They intentionally keep the sale open exactly for situations like this, so people who didn\u2019t get tickets could get cancelled ones.",

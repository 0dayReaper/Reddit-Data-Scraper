I know some people who genuinely felt bad and apologized and said their reasons that they have studies, work, or busy with family that's why they had no time to stream nor vote. If one can stream/vote then do it as a support for the idols but to call the fandom names and to lash out to other stans who did not stream/vote is irksome.

They ain't doing it just for the fans, they are actually lucky that their passions aligned with their careers. So don't feel guilty for using the time for more important things in life. We started listening to kpop as a form or entertainment, its never an obligation.",

            "comment": "I have a few, but only one comes to mind right now and it's people worshipping line distribution videos and sometimes even quarreling among their own fandoms because of it. I personally don't really have much opinion on line distribution as a whole \u2013 I understand that it can frustrate some people, but sometimes fans would really do whatever they can (including quantifying just a small GASP in the background) to prove that their favourite members have sung lines in a song. Also, timing it by seconds isn't really the most accurate way to calculate someone's amount of lines IMO. In fact there really isn't even a fair system to calculate line distribution at all.",

And then there are times in bands where it\u2019s just a song or two where a member doesn\u2019t have lines and that\u2019s fine. Like if it\u2019s a vocal line heavy song, I don\u2019t expect rap line members to get a lot of rap lines. And vice versa. I don\u2019t think they should force rap or singing into a song that doesn\u2019t need it. Or maybe it doesn\u2019t suit the song. Like if it\u2019s a  pop song, I might not expect a member with soulful voice to get a lot of lines. If it\u2019s a really soulful/R&amp;B type of song, I don\u2019t expect the member who has a really Pop song type of voice to have lines. \n\nAltho i guess I get screen time.

I understand that flow and vocal colour is a thing, but rap is usually ultimately judged with wordplay and storytelling. \n\nIf you can't understand the language let alone understand the intricacies, you can't really say for certain who is a better rapper than the other. There's translations, but that's a lot different -- that's the meaning, it doesn't say WHY that artist chose that specific word over its synonyms, why adding that word next to that word was clever, made a pun, etc. Unless you have someone break down each line for you of every rap song with a linguistic approach of WHY it works in the language, with every rap song, I don't think people should be shouting with their whole heart who is better.",

When idols try to hard to be the \u201cfunny, quirky\u201d one and fans getting mad at people for saying they don\u2019t find them funny and quite frankly the idols annoy them because they\u2019re clearly trying to hard\n\n2. I made a post about this yesterday. Using props and back up dancers in dance practice videos. I want to focus on the dance, not whatever is going on in the background because y\u2019all think it adds something.\n\n3. Fans getting mad at other fans for saying a KPop song reminds them of a western song. Like seriously how many times do we have to say that KPop is just pop sung in Korean. It\u2019s not some rare gem that was found in the caves of heaven.\n\n4. Trashing a member for another member with the same position simply because that member gets praised more, usually by the members themselves. Example just in case statement wasn\u2019t clear: NCTzens trashing Taeil because the members said he\u2019s their main vocal and proceeding to rant about how Doyoung and Jaehyun are better than Taeil when literally no one said they couldn\u2019t sing. Like they\u2019re all main vocalists for a reason, relax.\n\n5. Fans overanalyzing an idol\u2019s facial expressions. Saying cringy stuff like, \u201cxx member is sad today. His face says \u2018I don\u2019t feel good.\u2019 [insert-company-name] let him rest.\u2019\u201d When the idol is literally just sitting there probably lost in thought.\n\n6. Stylists purposely dressing one member differently for whatever reason. Example: if the group is wearing silver and black, they put one member in all white and gold. Why, just why? We know they\u2019re the center, visual, whatever. \n\n7. Fans constantly complaining about line distribution then turn around and say xx member can\u2019t sing or rap. If you think they can\u2019t sing or rap then why are you complaining about them not having the same amount of lines as the \u201cbetter\u201d singers/rappers in the group.",

Its just annoying to me considering we don't really know that much about idols' beliefs and personalities. I find it funny as well that when an idol does cultural appropriation its the stylists fault but when they were a t shirt with a progressive message on it, they get praise.",

It may or may not be a lead single or single. \n\nThe song that comes out ahead of an album, gets a music video, and is heavily promoted and performed on shows and such is the lead single. \n\nCalling a lead single a title track just makes no sense and it's infuriating. If the titles aren't the same it's not a TITLE track.\n\nLots of other terminology that annoys me (but not as much as title track). \n\nThe refusal to use the term \"single\" makes it hard to talk about songs. What do you call a song which is promoted that is not the title track? K-pop has nothing. There is no word because single is for some reason banned. \n\nComeback: comeback implies an artist has been gone for an extended period of time. I'm not sure why K-pop had to create this special term for \"new album\".\n\nB-sides (this one I'll give you is up for debate) are not the same as \"album cuts\". Here again we have trouble discussing songs because we reject the term \"single\". If it's not the title track, it's a b side. Even if it had a MV and was heavily promoted. So you'll see posts asking for an artists \"most popular b sides\". And you'll get people comparing super successful second or third singles with album cuts that have never been performed outside of a concert and have no video. Apples and oranges.",

Like the Cherry Bomb chorus--that may as well not even be any NCT members \"singing\" it's so distorted. Amazing how it sounds exactly the same every time yet when a different member is in the center, the music show (or color coded lyrics or whatever) puts that member's name with the lyrics--I guess they must all be eating the same CDs! It's not because I'm super concerned about line distributions (I find them interesting but I don't obsess over them), but if you're gonna go to the trouble of making a video it should at least be accurate. Not to mention the times where it's credited to one person when it's clearly a different member's voice? Mainly thinking of Seventeen's Adore U, where Jeonghan's part is actually sung by Seungkwan. Actually, that reminds me of a question I've had for awhile--in Mansae, Jeonghan and Jun each have the same pre-chorus part. Unless I'm just not acoustically discerning enough, both times it sounds exactly the same and I can't tell whose voice(s) it actually is? Same with Victon's I'm Fine--half the chorus is credited to \\[ALL\\], and the other parts are split between Seungsik and Sejun (and Chan in the last chorus), but I can only hear Seungsik from start to finish. \n\nAnother is when people talk about Winwin's only line in Fire Truck being \"woop woop\" For one, he actually has two lines: \ubab8\uc744 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc5ec Pick it up and Maximum\uc73c\ub85c Turn it up. Two, the \"woop woop\" is actually \"what what.\" And three, I refuse to believe that the high-pitched voice(s) doing that part is Winwin. \n\nSorry this turned more into a rant/stream of consciousness. I'm a very nitpicky person with a lot of kpop thoughts and no one in my real life to share them with.",

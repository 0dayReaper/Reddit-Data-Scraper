I haven\u2019t heard someone actively talk about 24K other than you for at least a few years(I\u2019d say easily long before covid), dreamnote is leagues more popular than they are at least I can say where if you would say their name in the crowd of a K-pop concert I\u2019d say a solid amount of people would know of them. I don\u2019t know how many would say they are a fan of them. (From a US perspective)",

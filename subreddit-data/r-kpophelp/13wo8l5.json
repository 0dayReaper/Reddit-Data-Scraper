    "postText": "I was just listening to escape by gidle the other day and i realized that the melody of the [\"oh oh oh\" part in the chorus](https://youtu.be/S8qMGCPh6EY?t=66) feels oddly familiar?? idek how to put it other than im pretty sure ive heard that exact melody before but idk if im just thinking of escape itself or another song. I'm obviously not saying any plagiarism took place, im just curious to see if anyone feels the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: i finally found it its [this part of eight by iu and suga](https://youtu.be/TgOu00Mf3kI?t=81) !!",

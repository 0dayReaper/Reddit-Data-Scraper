Trainees aren't allowed to have personal socials or be in other outside content - Yorch, Sangwon and Woochan opening up their instas again was how we knew they'd left hybe.\n\nThere is however [video of the pledis nbg trainees](https://twitter.com/AlonersAssn/status/1660848762875441152?s=20) from a recent Seventeen concert that seems to show a couple boys that look A LOOOOT like JJ and James. They were fully covered in masks and hats, so it's pretty unclear. But I think it's very likely a talent like his would have been easily scooped up by Pledis or another Hybe label.",

I don't know though bc it's not usually BH's way of doing things. So I could be all wet.",

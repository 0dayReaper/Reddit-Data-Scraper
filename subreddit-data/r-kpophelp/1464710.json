Lots of big names in the lineup too...if you don't mind getting wet.\n\nActually, just browse through the events on ticketing sites like [Interpark](http://www.globalinterpark.com/main/categoryList?dispNo=01003&amp;shopNo=0000100000&amp;subDepth=Y&amp;prdTp=002). There's also BTS Suga's concert on 24/25 June, New Jeans fanmeeting on 1/2 July, etc but I highly doubt there's tickets left",

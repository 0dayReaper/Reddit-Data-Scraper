    "postText": "I found an artist recently named CYKORIAN, but besides two songs released in 2015 there\u2019s nothing about him. He\u2019s posted 21 music videos on YouTube under the channel \u201cX i GUN_Official\u201d over the past 5 years with the last one posted over a year and a half ago. There\u2019s no accounts on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc. He\u2019s pretty much disappeared after his last MV back in October 2021. If anyone knows anything it\u2019d be of great help if you could respond.",

Looks like they're going by X i Gun now but if you scroll down you'll see a lot of stuff for Cykorian so I'm assuming (without knowing the musician myself but based on what youve said plus all this) that its the same person.",

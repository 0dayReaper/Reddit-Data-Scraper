Most of the kpop stans brought lightsticks to the events especially Blackpink's lighstick since it matches her campaign color pink.\n\nFor the past few months there have been lots of arguments within Filo kpop stans since they didn't like that their faves were getting dragged to something political. (In reality most of them were supporters of the dictator's son who's also running for president).\n\nCurrently, Leni's opponent aka the dictator's son is leading the surveys for election since he has a very large cult-ish following. It also helps that his vicr president running mate is the daughter of the current President Duterte (who also has a large cult-ish following).\n\nAlso the opposing parties always resort to ad hominem and hate Leni with a passion so they always try to discredit her work as a vice president. They even call her \"Leni lugaw\" (which translates to Leni porridge). Because of the time she gave out porridge to feeding programs. Tbh she just gets bashed for everything she does, especially since she's a widower and a single mom of 3 successful young ladies.\n\nOn the other hand, the dictator's son and most of the stuff their family does is sketchy and faked (diplomas etc). Which is often why their supporters resort to low tactics in order to tarnish her image.\n\nDespite all of this, the opposition is still strong because of the historical revisionism in the Philippines which is why kpop stans tried to do their role in trying to promote the candidate that is better suited to help the country.\n\nKpop stans continues to try to promoting Leni in the way we usually promote our faves and it just escalated to the Leni-sunbaenim thing.\n\nedit: also just to add, the reason why we also dont want Ferdinand Marcos Jr. aka the dictator's son to win is because his family has shown no remorse whatsoever about their crimes (ill-gotten wealth, tax evasion cases, and the literal murder of thousands of  dissenters from the Martial Law during his father's presidency, countless lies, and the list goes on)",

She has done lots of great things and understand some current issue very well. She loves to help the poor people and would always donate stuff, and she was one of the politicians to do some action during the early days of covid until now. She also agrees to have tobacco be legally used as medicine. Approves of gay marriage and very accepting. \n\nThe other candidates can be pretty controversial:\n\nBBM, he was the dictators son before who proclaimed Martial Law in the Philippines that caused alot of rallies and deaths. His father was also the main reason Philippines went bankrupt because they used all of the money of the country to buying jewelries, accessories, dresses for the first lady/ wife of the President. And they did lots of infrastructures that were pretty controversial because one of the buildings failed and killed lots of construction workers onsite, and were not given proper burial and were left dying under the building. The building is still intact until now, and many say it's hunted. The problem with him is that he doesn't do any better than his father. He is planning to continue on what his father did. He has lots of supporters, who used to support his father and some who believes he can make Philippines flourish again.\n\nManny Pacquiao, he is a professional boxer and a world champion. The problem is, he had poor education(not saging its bad but it kinda is looking at the current situation). He was never a responsible senator, he rarely attended meetings and he did some pretty shady stuff. He is also homophobic and very conservative Christian. I watched his interview with one of the famous host in the Philippines, and he is very bad at it. He is a strong candidate because he is famous, and lots of people idolizes him qnd believes he'll change the game because he experienced poverty.\n\nIsko Moreno, he used to be a child star and is currently the mayor of the capital city, Manila. He did lots of good things to the City, but he also did some shady stuff. However, he's a good choice if ever Leni doesn't win because he knows how to fix problems. When the general public complains about something wrong, he does listen and tried to find a solution. He has some loyal supporters but not so many.\n\nPing Lacson, he is very old and has been in the government for years, so he knows how to operate. The problem is, he is very old school and traditional. Your typical boomer, but he started changing some of his words to suite the current generation. That's pretty much all I know from him, because in the first place his stance isn't that high.",

To summarize, the Philippines currently is in the campaign period for the 2022 national elections where we will be electing our next president, vice president, senators and congressmen/women/people for the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as local executive positions. \n\nUnlike countries like the US who employs the 2-party system, the Philippines employs a multiparty system where any citizen can run if he/she/they/them fits the qualifications. \n\nCurrently, the top five presidential candidates are composed of the following people:\n\n1.

            "comment": "People have already answered, but I'm here to add in my own two cents.\n\nLeni is actually Leni Robredo: economist, lawyer (she was actually part of an NGO which provided legal counsel to marginalized groups before entering politics), and current Vice President of the Philippines (her rise to the VP position is quite inspiring too, if you ask me).\n\nShe's currently a candidate for the Presidential position, and out of all of them, she's a standout in terms of her history of clean governance, her experience of working at the grassroots level\u2014which others don't have\u2014and of course, her platforms which include ways to better handle the pandemic (the Philippines has *not* been handling it well so far), to support small businesses, and more.\n\nAs many have said, this campaign is an uphill climb: the leading candidate\u2014the son of a dictator who is known to have imprisoned and killed thousands of dissenters and who sent the country into a hole of debt it [is still paying](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/774774/well-pay-marcos-debt-until-2025) at the same time that they looted its coffers for themselves and their cronies\u2014has greatly benefited from a disinformation campaign that falsely paints the years of dictatorship as the country's 'Golden Age' and advocates a return of the dictator's family to power to make the country great again. Familiar rhetoric, right? Since she is one of the opposition advocates against this denial of history, these campaigns have also made it their mission to damage Leni's reputation; she is ridiculed for every little thing, and many spliced videos are released to make her seem stupid and to sway voters against her.\n\nK-pop Stans 4 Leni is basically a movement of people who stan groups across kpop who have decided to unite for Leni's cause. They share her vision of what the country could be with good leadership and are now using the platforms available to them to raise awareness on Leni's platforms that emphasize radical love over hostility, misinformation, and authoritarian politics. It's quite inspiring really. Fandoms you would see fighting like no tomorrow during awards seasons are now coming together out of love for country.",

Kpop fans are oftentimes seen only as made up of teens or immature individuals but this movement by the filo stans just proves that our voices shouldn't be belittled. They've actually held a few spaces discussing the elections and to also find ways to move this talk beyond twitter and unto other Filipino who are misinformed or choose not to be enlightened because of the political machinery of the opposition. It may come off as jest but I'm really happy seeing a lot of young ones and first time voters not only feel excited to practice their right to vote but also patiently and actively participate for the sake of our country.",

She is up against Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. for the next Philippine president who is actually son of a dictator which initiated Martial Law here in the Philippines that left several Filipinos dying of hunger and poverty. His family is also the reason as to why CCP or Cultural Center of the Philippines was constructed quickly that eventually collapsed because of poor foundation and left several construction workers dead (it was even 1 of the creepiest places in Manila aside from Ozone Disco located in Tomas Morato). Leni is trending online via Twitter (also on Facebook among Filipino FB users) as Leni Sunbaenim because Philippines is now on a campaign period for the next Philippine president this May 9 elections. Several Filipino KPop fans are greatly supporting her (also campaigning to other voters of choosing her) because the platforms she has planned ahead is not just for self-satisfaction but something that would benefit all Filipinos such as healthcare accessibility, work for everyone and education for all which must be the main priorities of the succeeding president and Leni has it all. Also, the main reason as to why she is trending online is because if Filipinos would once again elect another incompetent president, there would be slimmer chance of having KPop concerts here in the Philippines due to poor response in controlling COVID pandemic, concert tickets would be more expensive since the debt of Philippines in World Bank would increase (currently the debt of Philippines is around 11.7 trillion pesos) which results to increase of taxes and products/services given (and that includes KPop concert tickets), most of all, military enlistment shall be strictly implemented. In addition, if Bongbong Marcos would be the next leader of the Philippines, there is a higher possibility that his parents crimes will be pardoned, Martial Law shall return, poverty will be quadrupled, Philippines will suffer for the next 6 years like what happens currently in North Korea plus people in the healthcare sectors shall escape to work and eventually settle abroad for a living.",

Some of the reasons why many of us are rooting for her so much is because she's one of a kind, has genuine heart for Filipinos especially the underprivileged, and has the best compassion to her work. We have seen that through her post as vice-president, the problem is that all throughout her administration, massive web of lies have been thrown at her and it's worse now that the campaign period is ongoing. It has all started when she beat the dictator's son for the vice-presidential post in the previous national elections, back in 2016.\n\nMost Filipinos have been seen to forgot the dark history of the Marcoses (the dictator's family) and believes that the son can make the country great again. But there's still lots of us here that chose to be more aware of their legacy through documentaries and basic researches and that is why we would never believe him. He's clearly not into service, more into power. Just like his father. \n\nThat is the utmost reason why there has been so many movement groups (Kpop stans, local fans, doctors, teachers, lawyers, communities etc.) campaigning for Leni, simply because she is the son of the dictator's total opposite. Unfortunately, many Filipinos have yet to foresee that she is the best fit for the country, and tend to focus on her flaws (though her flaws are nothing to her good deeds) most people here also believes in a lot of fake news about her circulating in social media. She's clearly one of those public figures that are victims of huge misinformation. \n\nWe have already lose a chance to be led by an extraordinary woman (named late Miriam Defensor-Santiago, dubbed as \"The Iron Lady of Asia\". She ran last 2016 but lost, then died the same year). Personally, I don't think there would be another Leni Robredo that has the guts to fight for her countrymen despite everything she's been through. (Also she is the only woman among the 10 presidential candidates this election). \n\nIf she didn't win this, probably she will have the best life ever because she'll be finally free of all the harsh bashing, fake accusations and discrimination, she can successfully end her vice-presidential post (and I can say of all the past vice-presidents that ruled since I was here, she is the best), she can now be with her daughters more often, live by her hobbies (kpop, kdramas, etc.) Many will still look up to her. But, Filipinos will surely be losing an exemplary public service that she could have offer. \nIn spite of that, I believe that she can and will still help a lot of people without a position, that is in her character. \n\nHowever, the best option would be her leading the country. No one could resolve everything in a 6-year term, but her love and pure dedication to serve the people would promise a better Philippines.\nPlease wish us that she'll make it. \n\n\nBy the way, she has the cheeriest and most energetic supporters of all the candidates. Count the Kpop stans in. \n\n\n#LetLeniLead\n#LeniSunbaenim\u2728\n\n\n\nManang Leni, kung saan-saan ka nakakarating. Ganda ng exposure mo!",

Whatever era we're in, opposing factions or opinions are inevitable and balancing is almost impossible. There are advantages to a certain group of people supporting a candidate, and gathering attention is one of them. But I also say, that's also a weakness, since people generally have a negative connotations when it comes to kpop fans. Although I guess, it's still a publicity.\n\nThanks for understanding, also I do know and accepted that I couldn't stop others from posting about politics, after all, this is kpop thoughts. From my and others perspective, Kpop is somehow an escape, and that in itself is also a valid reason, no matter how different that is from others' opinions. I would also agree that kpop has been used for different social and political issues but I would focus mainly on khiphop, since the very origins of hiphop was to criticize the government and society itself.",

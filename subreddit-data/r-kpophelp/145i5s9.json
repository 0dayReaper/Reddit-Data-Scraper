I ordered from the first round (the doll and a shirt) and Global Shop recently updated saying they\u2019re going to start shipping them out later this month. They originally had it listed as shipping out end of May but just changed it.\n\nEDIT: Usually they take a week or 2 to ship out items that ARENT preorders. All the CCOMAZ stuff were preorders so they\u2019re going to take longer since they physically don\u2019t have any of the items in stock.",

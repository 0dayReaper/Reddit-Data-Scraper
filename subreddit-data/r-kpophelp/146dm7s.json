And are they in each and every kpop album? Thank you!",

I was able to use the QR codes from when I bought my SVT albums, but itll ask you to fill out a survey first before you get your weverse cash. And I'm pretty sure as long as its a group from weverse it'll have the QR codes there (Like SVT).",

I\u2019m a big fan of K-pop, especially groups like dreamcatcher, xdinary heroes, sp pretty heavy music, but LOONA has always been one of my favorites when I just wanted to feel cute and happy\n\nAnyway, I tried searching online but the updates are kinda outdated atp. Does anyone know what\u2019s going to happen to Loona after the whole issue with BBC? Will the group relocate to another company? Will they still do the same concept? I don\u2019t use Twitter or Instagram anymore so idk what\u2019s happening with them \ud83d\ude2d pls help",

            "comment": "- Chuu has signed with ATRP, a new company where she is the only artist. She has mentioned preparing for a solo debut that may come out later this year\n- Kim Lip, JinSoul, Choerry, and Heejin won an injunction before the other girls and have signed with Modhaus. This company is run by LOONA\u2019s old creative director, Jaden Jeong (an extremely controversial figure for orbits). OEC is actively preparing to comeback, hopefully this summer\n- Hyunjin and Vivi won their case after the others and have extremely recently signed together to a different company called CTDE&amp;M. This is also a new company, and the CEO worked on LOONA\u2019s team in the past and Hyunjin has expressed excitement at working with her again. No comeback news as this is so recent \n- The other girls are still stuck under BBC and have ongoing lawsuits",

            "comment": "LOONA is essentially in limbo right now. The CEOs of the companies that the girls have moved to (minus Chuu) both worked on/with LOONA &amp; BBC in the past, so I wouldn't be surprised if they support reuniting the group. For a TLDR;\n\n-Chuu is under ARTP, which I don't know much about.\n-HeeJin, Kim Lip, JinSoul and Choerry are under Modhaus, whose CEO worked on LOONA. They are recording music and are part of a project called ARTIMIS\n-HyunJin and ViVi are under CTS E&amp;M, whose CEO also worked on LOONA.\n-The remaining 5 girls are still under BBC.\n\nThe girls have all been very adamant about LOONA being together, so there's a very good chance the group will reunite once all the girls are out of BBC. For now though, the group is basically dead until the other girls get out of there.",

    "postText": "I bought the 1 Day Pass for Weverse Con Festival for 6/10. I am a bit confused on the correct method to enter.\n\nI bought my ticket through Global Interpark. On the [weverse description](https://weverse.io/weversezone/notice/12879?is_retargeting=true&amp;source_caller=ui&amp;shortlink=i7qo7ykm&amp;pid=Bridgepage_23weversecon&amp;af_click_lookback=1h&amp;af_xp=social&amp;af_force_deeplink=true), it states \"When entering the venue, your ticket can be checked when you present the QR code on your Interpark app or Interpark Ticket app.\" However, the email confirmation that I received from Interpark Ticket (through Global Interpark), states \"Mobile tickets can be accessed and used after logging into Global Interpark. Screen captures of the ticket will be denied at entry.\"\n\nNow I did download both the Interpark app and the Interpark Ticket app and used my Global Interpark credentials in attempt to login. It did not work. I believe you can login only in the app if you create an account through the app (in Korean).  \n\nSo now, I am wondering if past attendees needed to use the app, or if I could just show my mobile ticket on a mobile web browser because I am able to login to Global Interpark on a mobile web browser.",

Interpark seems to be very unhelpful so this problem won\u2019t be just you, there will be other people with similar issues \ud83d\udc9c",

(I translated it with Papago though) \n\n*Me: But I need the Interpark mobile app to get the QR code and use the mobile ticket, right? Can I use a mobile ticket as a laptop?*\r  \n\r  \n*Interpark: In the case of the Korean site, it is possible to use a separate mobile application (or Interpark ticket application)*\r  \n\r*For global reservations, the application is not applied, so access to the Global My Page -&gt; QR code will be activated*\r  \n\r*You can check it on My Page even if you don't receive it by mail*\n\nI'm starting to gain hope again, but I wanted to ask you a question. You said you were able to see your ticket reservation via a web browser on your phone, right? \n\nAs for me, I can log into my account on my phone via a web browser too, but when I click on \"order\" to see my ticket, it says \"\u274cSORRY\" \n\nDid you have this problem too?",

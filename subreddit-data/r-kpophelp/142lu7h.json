Tbh I could never cross the first three episodes of other survival show cause they bored the tf out of me, but Boys Planet had me HOOKED. \n\nThe show was fruity af down to the last moment. Junhyeon literally said on national television that Jiwoong has a face that men like. The finale was literally Zhang Hao and Shanbin getting married and were kind enough to let Mnet host a survival show in the middle of it lol. \n\nAlso this lineup has to be the best lineup that could have ever come from a survival show? Anyone in the top 18 (or even top 25?) could have made it and it would make sense because all of them are so freaking talented, good looking and just amazing. \n\nTbh, I tried not to get too attached and just watch from the sides, cause I my 1 pick didn't make it in GP999 but I've failed miserably lol.",

It's so heartwarming that the contestants forget that it's a survival show sometimes.  It has so much talent that would have gone unnoticed if Peak Time didn't happen. \n\nAlong the same line as Idol Producer - CPOP - **Chuang 2021** aka Produce Camp 2021  but I haven't watched Idol Producer. There might be ppl from Idol Producer on it. There's international trainees who barely knew Chinese when they first started but the friendship across cultures and language barriers is so great. This show had me on an emotional roller coaster. Amber Liu from f(x) was a mentor.  Hiroto and Ichika was on Chuang 2021 before Boys Planet.",

For guys, Boys Planet. \n\nThose 2 shows actually remind of each other because they were both batches stacked with talent to the point that the final Top 18 are all debut worthy.\n\nI love that both shows were kinda unserious and half the time felt like a comedy variety than a survival show. Survival shows should focus on fun, personalities and friendships rather than drama and evil edits in my opinion. It's just less stress lol\n\nThese were also the 2 seasons/shows where I was 100% satisfied with the debuting 9 members. Not all my fave picks made it but the final lineups were still amazing. \n\nP.S. I also loved Youth With You 3 but that went down in flames in the end so nvm \ud83d\ude2c",

I also loved ywy s2, I didn\u2019t watch s3 bc of what I heard about the ending :(\n\nTotally agree about the personalities and being more about fun than serious! That\u2019s what I loved sm about idol producer was the personalities and it literally was a comedy but the next season (when they switched the name to ywy, so s1 I guess) was SOOO much more serious. They made it much much more about the process and stress of the situation and all, which is cool, but no where near as entertaining.",

I remember once they went into the desert and they let the guy that ran the place explain all about it and literally the rest of the segment was them playing with puppets that were out \ud83e\udd23 also reminds me of the classical music dudes. Totally respect them but their classroom segments and all were a bit bland compared to idol producer when the classroom segments was Jackson wang and Jin having fun\n\nAlso I think part of it was expectations too bc idol producer had soooo many personalities and stars, I think only maybe 2-3 of ywy1 contestants would\u2019ve had a chance to be top 9 if they were in the idol producer 100, but I\u2019m biased lol\n\nEDIT: actually looked at the top 9 comparisons\u2026. It\u2019s SOOO hard for me to see xaio gui not getting top 9 and he finished EIGHTH! Idk interesting to think about but maybe only li wenhan makes it LOL",

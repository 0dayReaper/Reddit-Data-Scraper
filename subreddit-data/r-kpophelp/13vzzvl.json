Some strangers and acquaintances get curious and asks who he is but I just answer them like I like his group especially him so I bring his pc with me because it makes me happy. Some may find it weird but it really boils down on how you handle it because after all, you can't please anyone. Whether you bring them or not, someone's gonna judge you so might as well do whatever makes you happy :)",

He had boy band shirts and sewed patches on his jean jacket and helped me sew patches on my school backpacks and bought me boy band pin buttons. Not a single person said a thing to him, or assumed anything all those years ago. We still chat about boy bands and he\u2019s about to turn 70. I am trying to get him into all the Kpop groups I love. So far he\u2019s impressed with SHINee &amp; MonstaX and I\u2019m so proud about this\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc9c \nExpress what you gravitate towards with a smile and with pride\ud83e\udef0\ud83c\udffb",

He was a musician and listened to my music with me growing up, too. Not necessarily the boy bands specifically, though he wasn't disinterested/opposed to them. He loved rock music, so he especially loved my more rock-pop interests like No Doubt, Avril Lavigne, etc. But he listened to all of my pop music and never judged it. His ongoing passion for music was a big inspiration to me to keep loving what I love. I vote for OP to do the same. \n\nGender doesn't matter here; music is universal and life is too short not to express your passions &amp; enjoy them! Go for it, OP!",

In my experience, unless you think you're going to put yourself in danger by doing so, it's best to just express yourself and dress/accessorize however you want becuase you'll attract people with similar interests and people who think it's weird just won't talk to you. win-win.",

Meanwhile, it's weird for men to idolize men that *do not* fit the traditional standards of masculinity. So it wouldn't be weird for OP to wear merch by some rappers/reggaeton artists, but it would be weird to carry a male kpop idol pc.\n\nThis is a very US-centric comment btw and does not apply to other countries",

I'd pull you aside as a fellow carat and discuss all things Sebong related. :)\n\nOn a serious note, I write this not only for you, but for myself: **do not care about others for they do not care too much about you**. I worry *constantly* if I am being judged by others. I am constantly vigilant of my surroundings. My anxiety and paranoia get me. I have to remind myself that people have lives--emotions, motivations, tasks, and values different than me. I am not them. ***Honestly, they most likely could care less***\\*\\*.\\*\\* Most of the time, people are deeply enveloped in their own worries, tasks, and emotions. *Breathe, let yourself go, and display that damn pc.*\n\nIf you get enjoyment, comfort, love, or inspiration from looking at a pc, DO IT. *Ultimately, it is for you. Ultimately, it is an expression of yourself.* It is your bag/wallet/piece of whatever. You have a right to display what and who you want. You have a right to be yourself.\n\nThis is coming from a BSS ult. ***Horanghae***!",

But if someone does notice it and thinks anything about it, they might think it's like a pic of your friend or a pic of your boyfriend or something lol, so as long as you aren't bothered by people assuming that (if you're the type to wonder what people might be thinking when they look at you as they pass by in general, etc), and just have an easy response just in case someone does ask about it like \"no, it's just a member of a band I like\" or even \"yes, it's my boyfriend\" if you don't want to have a convo explaining the band to them lol. \n\nI put a pc or a mini instax photo of my bias (who's male) in my phone case, and I'm a guy and walk around with it like that all the time. In the like two years or more that I've been doing that, no one at all has stopped me to say or ask anything about it. Even before I had my ult group, I had a photo of a male member of a different group in my phone case, and it looked like a pic of a fake instagram live, and my mom looked at it, and instead of asking \"who's this boy?\" she asked \"how do you have a double sided phone?\" lmao, because she thought the fake instagram live pic was actually real. But also I'm gay and don't really care about people or strangers knowing that, so even if someone noticed a pic of a boy in my phone case or asked me about it I wouldn't really be bothered by telling them it was my celeb crush or whatever. \n\nAlso, I've seen several pics of male idols themselves with a pc of another male idol in their phone case. If they can do it without anyone caring, then I don't see why you can't too!",

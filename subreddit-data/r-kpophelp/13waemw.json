YDG sampled the instrumental and refrain of Lee Jaemin's [\"Alleyway\"](https://youtu.be/K0z3A99E3Is) for his song of the same name, and \"Twinkle Twinkle\" by Girl's Day interpolated partial lyrics from Nami's [\"Round and Round\"](https://youtu.be/93r3-zJjlgM). It's just not as common as covers/remakes due to licensing/credit issues.",

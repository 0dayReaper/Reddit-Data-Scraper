Or since lightsticks often get sold out ahead of time and your need to pre-order them anyway, don't buy them at the concert venue if you can help it because that extra money doesn't go to the group, it goes in Michael Rapino's pocket.\n\nBut otherwise, yes, you have to hold it the whole time, so bring a bag. Some venues require clear backpacks, so lots of people just default to that.",

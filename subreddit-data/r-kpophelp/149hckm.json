I don't know if that started it, but the barking dog thing has been huge ever since in a number of NFL stadiums. The sound \"hoo hoo hoo\" is more like a LARGE dog with a deep 'woof' voice.\n\nThere is also a think in rural America where young people with nowhere else to go gather on open fields to party. If it is a full moon, they have fun howling at the moon. LOL So vocally connecting with their animal dog feelings is a thing among certain groups in America. LOL\n\nAlso to me that indicates that there are men in the audience. Male audience definitely do it far more than women, and are likely to initiate it and others will follow along.\n\nI have no idea if any of that influenced kpop.

Or it\u2019s used as a distraction technique to mess other competitors up. Individual howling/catcalling at hot people is also a thing but usually isolated to desperate men barking/whistling at women walking alone. The only time I remember hearing barking/howling type of chants would come from fraternities getting drunk during sports weekends.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s real awkward IMO. I went to AB6IX\u2019s fancon back in July 2022 and people were barking then too. I think the first abnew to bark at ab6ix was in Atlanta, and it got a fun reaction out of ab6ix so it was like it infected the subsequent fancon meets to where the LA crowd was doing it too. I get why fans do it, but it\u2019s just so corny and it\u2019s a sound I associate with drunk fraternity bros so I hope this trend dies off lol.",

(Jeongyeon's emoji was the dog emoji and they would put her emoji on videos where she was not present like the Cry for Me Kelly Clarkson performance video) So I just assumed we were barking for her glorious return to performing.",

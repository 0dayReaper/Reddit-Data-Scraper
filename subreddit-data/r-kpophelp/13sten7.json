    "postText": "Specifically I was trying to secure Stray Kids tickets but scalpers were able to buy them almost instantly. For Blackpink I was able to to sign up for their official fa club and got pre-sale perks.  Is there anything like that for Stray Kids and Ateez? They both are coming out with another EP soon and I anticipate another world tour soon and wanna be sure I don\u2019t miss them this time around \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

I usually give it few weeks and buy through Vivid Seats, with the added bonus that Vivid Seats has a rewards program AND allows cashback through Rakuten. I\u2019m not crazy about presale bonuses or VIP, so it works out for me.",

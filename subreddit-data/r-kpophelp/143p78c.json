I also came across some of their reels/tiktoks and they seem very funny as well LOL \nDoes anyone have links to a guide to get to know the group? Discography, variety shows, etc.? \nThank you in advance \u263a\ufe0f",

Insomnicsy has a playlist called \"introducing series\" which shows different aspects of their personalities and what they are all about, like \"introducing dreamcatcher with their staff\"  or \"dreamcatcher being unfiltered idols\" etc.",

During that time the subreddit was completely frozen with no new posts or comments.\n\nBut now we're back!  **You may comment and post freely again!**\n\nIf you had posted a question right before the blackout you may want to delete it and make a new submission so it won't be buried by the algorithm due to being days old.\n\n**[Please read the post we have over in r/kpop for information on our stance for further protests.](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1490k6o/were_back_please_read_a_few_things_to_know_as_our/)**\n\nIn short, we will not be extending this blackout currently. The subreddit will remain public for the near future and we will let you know well ahead of time if that changes at all.\n\nThanks for your patience all!\n\n***\n\nWe know the following K-Pop related subreddit(s) are continuing with an indefinite blackout:\n\nr/kpopthoughts\n\n&gt; r/KpopThoughts has gone dark indefinitely in solidarity with Third Party Apps, disabled users and in response to Reddit's API changes.

The way I read that email was an attempt at internal damage control, because on top of all they have going on Reddit wouldn't want employee panic. \n\nIf you worked for Reddit right now, wouldn't you be afraid for your job? +90 people were laid off this week. So of course the CEO can't release a statement saying *we're in deep trouble* but other sources can.\n\nAnd other sources say that if the blackout continues for one week, ad contracts would start being pulled since they aren't meeting a quota. Reddit is also nowhere near a place to go public because what shareholder would invest in a community like this ATM? lol\n\nThe blackout also made Reddit crash multiple times on Monday. And I could go on, but one of the most affected sectors has been the tech one because they cannot look stuff up since communities were private.\n\ntl;dr: don't trust any of what the CEO is saying as a reliable source if information. I hope the blackout continues and if it does, it will at least force Reddit to have to negotiate.",

Could you please ellaborate more, as some people are \"in the dark\" about all that's going on?\n\nAs of right now:\n\n* Third Party Apps (like Apollo and rif, that started developing their apps *before* the Reddit App even launched) are still being killed effective June 30th.\n* Disabled users, particularly blind users, will not be able to access the community also effective June 30th.\n* The CEO has made false accusations against Christian Selig (Apollo's dev), threatened him during the public AMA, and made it clear they did not care at all about the protest.\n* They reiterated that the protest was \"only noise\" in an email sent to employees yesterday, despite firing +90 Reddit employees silently during these days.\n* AND the protest was actually starting to work - r/ModCoord is making a huge effort to organize communities and they let us know that advertisers were ready to end their contracts with Reddit if the protest continued for two weeks.\n\nWith all of the above being said, could you kindly clarify your stance to me? You said you support the blackout and went dark for those two days in hopes of things improving. Things didn't improve - but they could if you chose to remain dark for a bit longer. So I do not understand why you didn't at least open a vote with the community to keep the blackout going. Thanks in advance.",

Some subreddits will stay gone until reddit decides to leave the third party channels alone. Other subs did a two day blackout in solidarity. They\u2019re hoping this will get reddit\u2019s attention so they\u2019ll do what the people ask for. It\u2019s a great cause!",

All Third Party Apps will also be killed.\n\nSo this is directed at the mods: why not continue the blackout? Or at least let your community vote on it. You are a subreddit of considerable size that draws a lot of traffic. With no ill-intent I'm just trying to understand how you are supporting this measure by... staying online and giving Reddit traffic + ad revenue?",

One small subreddit might not mean much, but thousands of small subreddits closing in protest proves how shitty Reddit's decision is.\n\n&gt;Asking as politely as possible, shouldn't you at least put up a poll to see if this community agrees?\n\nWhy should they? If, as you said, \"*no one is dying because of kpop subreddits being closed*\". The community will be fine without the sub for a couple of days. Plus, it's their subreddit and they can do whatever they want with it.",

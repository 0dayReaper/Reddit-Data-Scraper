    "postText": "To elaborate my question, do they mean that they like the songs released during that generation the most or the artists themselves?. Like if a person says they prefer the 3rd gen, do they mean the music released during that time by all artists in Kpop, or the groups considered as having debut in the 3rd gen? (I know gens are kind of ambiguous and open to interpretation).",

Like autotune or CGI, or bots and algorithms, all are in moderations. 4th gen, it was starting to get out of hand, all groups autotune and lipsync, companies manipulating social media and charts, and there was no coming back from that. K-pop fans somehow keep forgetting computer technology exists while arguing on their phones. There\u2019s a whole genre of virtual idols, and fans somehow are still not connecting the dots.",

Sometimes, the idols if their sound didn't stray much to the sound profile. \n\nI think it's mostly the sound profile and the way that gen was running at that time frame.  \n\nI like 3rdgen for the type of music it has, nowadays very few group have that whispy elegant sound that people vall innocent concept (i prefer to say fairy ) or the fun lighthearted concept. Also, there are a number of group that has that vocal forward sound. \n\nIn terms of interaction, there is vlive. You go there and can stumble upon even groups you dont follow on random days and for free. There is also fancafe whose highest obstacle is understanding how to join, some quizes and an album. Otherwise, content is mostly free. \nNow its getting paywalled.\n\nPs. I miss the spontaneity that is vlive broadcast. ;A;",

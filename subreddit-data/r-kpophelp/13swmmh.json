I'm looking for a group that I don't know that has a decent sized discography (20+ songs preferably) so I can perhaps get into them. I'd like to say that I know quite a few groups and I'm really struggling to find more.",

IRRIS are super underrated. 3/4 members debuted in GOOD DAY and REDSQUARE together and the playlist of all their songs from those groups + the project group one member was a part of for a drama, remixes, and OSTs, they have a little less than 20 songs. Here's a [playlist of all of them](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5hVa1mDNYvYKvcjz7No8Qa?si=uEuq_2BSQ8-xsbjULTHh4A). Super underrated in terms of vocals and performance ability. Also I recommend checking out all their music videos. Their debut album has a music video for every track. Here's [a playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcQBPa5r9M-qmhH4rcm11UYjADmGg3RXa) for that too.\n\nTRI.BE are also super underrated. They're going on tour in the US this Summer and their performance skills are off the charts. They recently performed at [KCon Japan](https://youtu.be/KEPJIOBKHMU) and released a English version of a bside, [Wonderland](https://youtu.be/QXSYB24sC9k), for their US tour. Really recommend checking them out if you haven't already. And check out their dance practices too! They choreograph most of their bsides as a group.",

The list I made was unrelated to this post, it was my personal list of groups I've heard ALL of the music of, so a lot of big names are missing since they have a lot of music, like Apink, Gfriend, Twice and Loona.",

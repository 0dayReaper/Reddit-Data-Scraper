The MVs are lower budget than for their title tracks of course, but each comeback there's at least a couple. And they've done this since debut because Stray Kids being self-produced is a huge part of their identity as a group, so a lot of promotional efforts are centered on their music.",

Few years ago, each groups will perform title track and 1 b-side at music show. But in most case, fan is unable to stream the b-side as much as title, or these b-side are not popular on chart, while it still is money-consuming and time-consuming. When groups perform b-side, they have to change clothes, change stage set, need to do 3 rehearsals, so as time past, company cut it down. They only perform b-side when they see a good reaction/or expect a good reaction for it.",

MVs don't come cheap.\n\nAnd then efforts, it is not easy to master multiple choreography at the same time, lines etc. \n\nThen focus - broadcast time will be limited, better to push one song, than attempt multiple.\n\nFinally marketing perspective, easier to push one song to the fandom at a time than multiple.\nOnly a small percentage of fans will have the attention span and actually into music to dig into multiple songs.\n\nIt is not a case of B-sides not getting promoted, but more like songs that aren't promoted are \"B-sides\", \nFrankly things like title, b-side, pre-release are anachronisms.\n\nThere is only \"Promoted\" and \"Not promoted\"\n\nThink about it, how many Kpop acts actually chart songs without any promotion?\n\nIU, Bigbang maybe, they can release 8+ songs at same thing, chart all in top 10-20, with 2-3 having longevity.\n\nIU when she released Lilac, had some 16+ songs in the top 20 of Gaon, all from the album and few older songs.\n\nShe promoted only 3 from the album.\n\nSo from the business perspective promoting multiple songs concurrently isn't effective, might not be enough profit for the price.\n\nSo the new model, where they promote serially, give one song few weeks, then another - probably is more effective.\n\nBut are these songs then truly even from the same album?",

Usually it was the group performing in a room with a simple backdrop with lower quality film, editing and some added zoom in face shots. But I also think that mostly, those MVs may have been \"extra content\" that came with DVDs or was released only on YouTube and the song itself was never performed on music shows or TV unless it got a LOT of attention. I remember a few being \"remixed/remastered\" as an A-side, but it was rare.",

The more time you spend on a era the more risky it is because a b-side may not be as liked as a title trick and it's the same albums so your fans \"already spent their money\". Lot of labels rather push the idea of repackage because at least fans can buy a new albums, new versions etc...\n\nHybe can do that because they have money, but I can understand that for mid size labels it's harder. (G)-Idle do promote sometimes their b-side but yeah it requier to also pay for the pre-record time on music show (and it's not everyone who can bc it's not as the same time as the live), others clothes to buy etc... We don't see it like that as fans but the spend you have to do as label is insane. I totally get now how sometimes some groups explain that even a song that made it big wasn't that much of a money maker thing. \n\nBefore we used to have title track and sometimes b-side but like in half for almost every groups. (Except the really new one who literally had their title track cut the OG remember it....... it was a nightmare). Maybe now it cost more even for the music show to handle that who knows ?",

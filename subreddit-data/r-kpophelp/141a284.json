    "postText": "I GOT A TICKET TO SHINEE\u2019s CONCERT IN SEOUL!!!!!\n\nI\u2019m so excited but the only tickets available were standing room (aka GA, not seated) so now I\u2019m worried ill be in the back, unable to see a thing! My ticket did have a number assigned to it, so I don\u2019t know if that means anything. \n\nHas anyone ever bought standing room tickets to a concert (not festival) in Korea? Will I have to line up super early? \n\nAlso, do I need a light stick? Is it mandatory?",

The line-up generally starts about 1 to 1.5 hours before you can enter the venue. (Even if you don't buy any merch, I still recommend arriving early - some fans might be doing giveaways or taking selfies at the photo booth) The staff will hold up signs with numbers written on them (eg. no.1 - no.150, no.151 - no. 300, and so on) and start announcing that the standing seat queueing has started. They give you about 30 minutes to stand in lines of two per group, so there will be a numch of people holding up their tickets and asking others what their ticket number is LOL. If you arrive late and the staff are already in the process of leading the audience into the venue, you may be instructed to move to the very end of the line instead.\n\nRemember to wear comfortable shoes, since the wait in line means you will need to stand for at least an extra 30 minutes in *addition* to watching the show inside the venue!",

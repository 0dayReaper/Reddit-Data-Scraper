I understand these 3 songs aren\u2019t necessarily similar to each other themselves, so here\u2019s my description for each if it\u2019s helpful.\n\u2018Beam\u2019 is a slow, groovy R&amp;B track with minimal beats, but it\u2019s also soft and their voices are gentle and pleasing as well.\n\u2018New Look\u2019 is a retro kind of track, with synths and a catchy melody. The chorus also shows off the girls\u2019 vocal abilities! Overall, definitely a good upbeat song.\n\u2018Colorful\u2019 is also a dance type track, with pop vibes and has fun harmonizations. The song is just as the title says, colorful!\nIf there are any other K-Pop songs that fit either one of these descriptions, I\u2019d be happy to hear them!\nThank you!",

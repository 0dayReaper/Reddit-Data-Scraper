    "postText": "A while back around 2014-2016, I stumbled upon a masterpiece of a video on YouTube, a compilation of some amazingly edited BTS edits, the title was something along the lines of \"BTS Vine Edits Compilation\" or something basic like that. I remember the edits containing more serious and theatrical ones, sprinkled with a dose of AU edits. I believe it contained a couple of edits of a Suicide Squad (2016) AU and a couple of mafia AUs. The thumbnail had the typical Vine green sidebars/frame with a run time of 10-16 minutes. I also remember the user having a profile picture of Namjoon/RM of BTS with his pink hair from their 2015 'Run' era, with a flower crown.  \nIf anyone couple help me that would be greatly appreciate it",

    "postText": "So I remember back in december 2022 LE SSERAFIM and Zico danced to \u201clook at my baguette\u201d on LE SSERAFIM\u2019s tiktok and if you looked at the sound it says the song is from Zico. The thing is neither on youtube or spotify I can\u2019t find the song. It\u2019s like it\u2019s only on tiktok. Does someone have any idea why it\u2019s basically nowhere to be found?",

    "postText": "Hi, since summer is almost here I was thinking of going to the park to practice some dancing. I\u2019ve never gone to dancing classes, nor have danced seriously, the only thing I know is some basic moves and twirling around in a very cringey way lol, so I\u2019m looking for easy choreographies that can be learned by a beginner with 0 level. \n\nIt\u2019d be nice if the choreographies were from groups that I like, but I know that\u2019s asking a lot. Still, I\u2019ll leave here the list of some groups that I listen to, although you can recommend any choreography beginner friendly:\n\n-Vixx\n\n-EXO\n\n-Monsta X\n\n-Mamamoo\n\n-G-Idle\n\n-Xdinary Heroes\n\n-PIXY\n\n-DREAMNOTE\n\n-Le Sserafim\n\n-WayV\n\n-Enhypen\n\n-Drippin\n\n-Lee Gi Kwang\n\n-TXT\n\n-Stray Kids\n\n-Shinee\n\n-KARD\n\n-ICHILLIN",

Likey, TT, like ooh ahh ooh ahh, cheer up. Likey is sooo fun to learn and dance. It's been 4 years I learned it and I still do it randomly whenever the song comes on.",

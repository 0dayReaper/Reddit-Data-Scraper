    "postText": "So my friend just finished her first year of med school, and I'm making a silly playlist of songs with medicine-related titles to encourage her during the long nights studying. This started as a joke but turned into a real project haha. I mostly just know boy groups but would also welcome girl group recs. I want it to have up-beat vibes and not like cry-your-eyes-out ballads. Here's what I have so far:\n\n* Aboab (SHINee)\n* Symptoms (SHINee)\n* Love Like Oxygen (SHINee)\n* Heart Attack (SHINee)\n* Burning Up! (SHINee)\n* Love Sick (SHINee)\n* Cough (ONEW)\n* SCAR (SMTOWN)\n* FEVER (ATEEZ)\n* Side Effects (Stray Kids)\n* Ssick (Stray Kids)\n* Voices (Stray Kids)\n* Emergency (Day6)\n* Headache (Day6)\n* PARANOIA (KANGDANIEL)\n* Antidote (KANGDANIEL)\n* Eyewitness Account (CHANHYUK)\n* Siren (CHANHYUK)\n* Panorama (CHANHYUK)\n* Overdose (EXO)\n* Trauma (EXO)\n* Heart Attack (EXO)\n* DNA (BTS)\n* So Sick (A.C.E)\n* Cure (The Rose)\n* Dr. Bebe (PENTAGON)\n* Healing (SEVENTEEN)\n* Fever (MAX CHANGMIN)\n* Heart Burn (SUNMI)\n* Make Me Sick (TEEN TOP)\n* Siren (P1Harmony)",

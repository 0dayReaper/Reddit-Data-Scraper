I hope that sub will be back because I have been writing a long comment (saving from Markdown Mode to a Word doc just in case I lose the comment) for days compiling information for people about the JYJ lawsuit. The thing about that is I don't have the uns of all the people that wanted the information. I just hope the sub isn't gone for good and I can find these people. Would you happen to know an alternative sub similar to Kpopthoughts where I could share that information if Kpopthoughts doesn't come back so that I hopefully get it to the people that want it?",

I might resort to the other big sites for general kpop updates, or just skip them altogether for these 2 days.\n\nIn terms of after the API changes come into effect... I browse almost entirely on desktop using old Reddit + RES, so I'll stick around for the time being. If they remove old Reddit (which many redditors suspect will happen soon), or too many subs shut down indefinitely, I might keep my account but will probably spend less time on this site in general. Maybe transition to a combination of Reddit + another site.\n\nLike you, I don't have much desire to participate in any of the other large sites. Many people have mentioned Discord, but I personally don't see it as a complete replacement for Reddit - I would prefer something with the same kind of archival value and public visibility that only subreddits provide. Also, some users are discussing moving to Fediverse-based platforms such as Lemmy, which have similar features as Reddit but are more decentralized. That could be something to consider if it takes off.",

There is a forum feature, but I haven't seen much successful use of it.\n\nOther than that, I don't think there's really much for organized discussion. Do people actually have conversations in tiktok? I was under the impression it's mostly just like youtube comments, except with less bots and more toxic 12 year olds.",

This will therefore shut down these third-party apps. Many mods use third-party apps for moderation purposes such as to keep away adult content and spam meaning they can't do their jobs with those apps gone. The Reddit blackout calls for people to not use Reddit and subs to go private so that people can't post or comment on June 12 and 13. Some subs have started the blackout early. The hope is that the blackout will have Reddit made changes to the new API policy.",

While it's an unpopular move by Reddit, Reddit will be completely fine.       \nReddit pretty much has monopoly on this kind of format (not to mention brand recognition), there's no real competitor to go to, so people will stay here.    \nThe protest is a way to get an opinion heard that will resonate more than just the regular threats of leaving, but it's no apocalypse.     \n        \nEven if an astronomical and unrealistic number of something like 700 million people left, there would still be more than twice the number of active users left compared to when I joined Reddit for the first time.    \nWith 90% of users not even being affected by the changes why would they all leave?           \nI don't see the realism in the doom-posts.   \nWhile niche subreddits can always disappear and pop up by their moderators whim at all times, this one (as in r/K-pop)won't go anywhere.

I have zerooooo friends in real life to discuss Kpop with. I have a lot of friends but none remotely like Kpop. Well one. But she only like BP and 2 songs at that. \n\nI came to Reddit /Twice to tell everyone the good news I\u2019d scored tickets this week and everyone was so happy for me. I told two IRL friends and they maybe said\u2026cool? Like they legit don\u2019t care. It\u2019s fine.\n\nAnyways that\u2019s why I like Reddit though",

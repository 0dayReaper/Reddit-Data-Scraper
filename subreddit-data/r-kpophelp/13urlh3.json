    "postText": "So I've just been confused about something for a while.  I know it's normal for fans of a group to call themselves by the fandom name (ex. MOA for TXT fans, Blink for Blackpink fans, etc.) and that this is the same name the official fan club goes by.  However, I've come across a few articles and posts online, mostly about kpop fandom etiquette and fanchants and stuff, that say if you're not a member of the fan club, you shouldn't call yourself by the fandom name.  I don't know if only Korean fans follow that \"rule\" or if international fans are expected to do the same, because that seems a bit exclusionary and insensitive to fans who can't afford fan club membership.  Is this just an older and outdated piece of fandom etiquette?",

            "comment": "It sounds very outdated. And defining yourself as a _____ is different to everyone. Your own definition of calling yourself an Atiny, a stay, a blink is personal. \n\nI consider myself a _______ fan only if I buy albums, know all the members, consume all their discography and watch variety shows. Therefore I'm only part of two fandoms. \n\nSome people consider themselves a _____ fan for only liking the title tracks and that's okay!! Some other people consider themselves a ______ because they know the names of the members and can differentiate them. Some others only consider themselves a ______ because they saw the group in a concert. It's mostly how it works in Kpop.",

I consider myself part of many fandoms (MOA, Luvity, Carat, M1-KEY, etc.) and I love all the members and lots of their songs, but I'm not usually able to buy tons of albums and stuff, much less afford multiple fan club memberships, so I wasn't sure if it was appropriate to call myself by the same name as fans who do so much more for the group.",

Like I said it's super personal and if, to you, it makes sense, then you are 100% right to say you are part of this fandom or that fandom. \n\nDon't worry it's less deep than we think! :)\n\nEdit: nobody will be more fan than another. Think of it this way, when people say \"true metal fans listen to this group\" or \"true gamers only play fps games\" it sound ridiculous right? Same for kpop fandoms :)",

If you\u2019re a multi stan? You\u2019re not a real stan. Oh you don\u2019t stream 24/7/ buy 382828 albums, you\u2019re not a real Stan. Etc etc. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t really pay attention to stuff like this. If you wanna say you\u2019re a fan then you are.",

I live in the US and had a pass in 2014 but they changed the rules a few years later.\n\nETA: Without a pass the app is useless though. It\u2019s not like Spotify where you can listen for free with ads.",

You can just use it like Spotify or your preferred streaming app. Just know it's a paid service so you have to purchase a pass before being able to stream. But then again, this was 4 years ago so I'm not sure if something changed.",

I think it requires a Korean card or some kind of proof that you're Korean the last I heard. I remember buying a pass back in 2016-2017, and even Melon giving out free passes, but I don't think foreigners are able to anymore \ud83d\ude2d With a Korean apple account you'll be able to use the app but every song will only be a minute long, so it'd probably only be useful for looking at the charts",

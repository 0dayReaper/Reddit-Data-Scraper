I feel like my answer would be biased bc even though I have girl group music on my playlists, I follow boy groups more. Ik she writes a lot of articles and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s why she\u2019s asking so I wanted to give her a non biased truthful answer.\n\nSo basically, if a non kpop Stan asked you to answer objectively, who are some of the hottest groups (male and female) out right now, what would you say?\n\nEdit: for reference I said \n\nBG: txt, enhypen, stray kids, Ateez, seventeen, nct\n\nGg: ive, le SSERAFIM, twice, new jeans, nmixx, aespa, (G)I-DLE\n\nAlso people are making really good points. By \u201chot right now\u201d I mean in a general sense (international or Korean, both opinions are great!). Not groups that are like big and have had lasting longevity, I mean like what\u2019s popular in kpop RIGHT NOW (that sounds so aggressive lmao, I just don\u2019t know how to bold things on mobile I\u2019m sorry lol)",

Enhypen and Ateez also seem to be pretty hot internationally, while not being super big domestically (Bite Me is doing pretty well for an enhypen release though). Aespa is well known here, though I wouldn\u2018t say \u201ehot\u201c - I feel like they are also more popular internationally.",

I personally don\u2019t know much about them either. I went to a mixed concert where they were one of the acts a few months ago and they were placed pretty early in the lineup with little attention from the audience.\n\nIn Korea most people aren\u2019t \u201eKpop fans\u201c but rather fans of one or mayyyybe two groups and don\u2019t really care for who\u2018s who outside of that. They\u2018ll still hear the songs being played everywhere of course, but they treat it similarly like most of us in the west when random stuff plays on the radio. Unless a group is REALLY everywhere (like the ggs mentioned above; viral and being played in stores at least trice per hour), chances are a random western Kpop fan will know the group better than a random Korean person off the street, even if that random Korean is in their late teen or early 20s.",

They\u2018re charting well, so I\u2019ll probably encounter it soon!\n\nI currently, as written, feel like they are more popular internationally as compared to domestically but still VERY popular here. Not necessarily as \u201ehot\u201c as the other mentioned GGs, but if I didn\u2019t classify it as bg/gg and just did a top acts overall, I could\u2018ve added them and dropped the boygroups \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude48 girlgroups are still DOMINATING, as they have been in 2022!",

When I saw them in concert here in Seoul last summer their venue had a capacity of only ~6k, and this year they\u2018ll already be doing KSPO, which is the standard concert venue in Seoul!\n\nEnhypen unfortunately just doesn\u2019t receive as much enthusiasm here as they do internationally. When I went to kpopflex in Germany last year people FREAKED out for them, but here they\u2018re still just treated as one of the many Kpop groups out there. Their songs aren\u2019t being played in public a lot, even during their promotion period, and people don\u2019t talk about them much.\n\nFor comparison, TXT\u2018s last title track sugar rush ride from January was number 191 on melon yesterday, and peaked top 12 in mid-February.\n\nSeventeens current comeback Super was number 9 yesterday and peaked at 5.\n\nStray Kids (the \u201emaybe they will become hot\u201c- case) was 107 yesterday and peaked 104 shortly after release.\n\nEnhypens current title track Bite Me was number 344 yesterday and peaked 326 on release day.",

They're also both more popular overseas.\n\nI'm saying that IF you have to pick one, I'd go with Ateez to diversify it some - there's more to Kpop than the Big4. Especially since both groups are relatively at the same level of success, and with Ateez managing to just be in the conversation coming from a smaller company, I think that warrants them being a pick.\n\nI don't see how you'd find fault with Ateez being on the list, but not Enhypen, is what I'm getting at. Especially since Ateez, *who just happens to be the only non-big4 group mentioned,* is the one that they're suggesting be taken out.",

I understand their whole concept is made to make you think they're you're boyfriends, but they're not. No need to ride them so hard.\n\nAh yes, \"Oh KQ bought ads.\" Everyone buys ads, and you're ridiculous to think Enhypen's company did not buy ads for their comebacks. My god, next you're gonna whine about how KQ bought promotions for their upcoming album. BFFR. Touch some grass.\n\nAnd if you look at 2022 sales, Yes, Enhypen is 3rd, but guess who is 4th - ATEEZ.\n\nI said their sales were similar - and they are. The difference is that Ateez didn't come from a big4 company popularized by BTS. And yet, they're still #4.\n\nThe question is asking who is hot right now- and it's quite undeniable that Ateez have been on a huge come-up since Guerrilla - which is a song tied for the most wins by a 4th gen bg if I'm not mistaken.\n\nYou talk about how music show wins have a lot of factors- and they do- yet you ignore the various factors that go into streaming numbers and popularity in general.\n\nSimply by being in the Big 4, you start WAY above everyone else. That's why its so great when a group like Ateez or FIFTY-FIFTY are able to become successful - it takes more. You can throw streaming numbers around all day long, but in terms of *actual impact* \\- Ateez and Enhypen are quite similar.\n\nI'm not saying Enhypen doesn't deserve to be mentioned - I'm merely saying Ateez doesn't deserve to be excluded. Both groups are talented and popular.",

Ateez peaked at 3, Enhypen at 6.\n\nAteez's single album for Halazia almost charted as high as Enhypen's highest charted album.\n\nThere are A LOT of different metrics that can be used to prove one group is more successful than the other.\n\nThat tells me that both groups are actually quite similar in terms of success- and thus equally deserving of mention.\n\nTo exclude Ateez's presence on the list while defending Enhypen's is simply pure cope.",

If one is really into K-pop, they might have heard of them but it\u2019s not like they are popular or well known in Korea. They don\u2019t have famous members, hit songs and they never chart. You Atinys are a bit delusional, like you wish they were immensely popular domestically lol. There is nothing wrong with having a career being mostly overseas, they will definitely survive with their album sales and tours. Why do you think Ateez tours so often and regular? Because that ensures an income given their large global fan base.",

Theres no reason for you to call me or atinys in general delusional for saying that they are gaining attention in SK. I, along with most atinys are extremely well aware about how they are not popular in SK, hardly ANY boy groups even are, with very few exceptions. OFC atinys would wish that ateez finally gains popularity domestically, but we know that that isnt common for boy groups and especially ones from a company as small as KQ. If you wanna talk about \u201cpopular\u201d members in SK, san in particular is very well known and so is jongho, people usually name them whenever they are asked about ateez. And about hit songs, like i said, wave and utopia are very well loved in SK, utopia essentially became SK\u2019s sports anthem and was getting played repeatedly at their national soccer games and went viral for it. Just because they arent pulling Big 3 girl group level charting numbers on domestic charts doesnt mean that they arent still doing well and gaining domestic attention anyway. They havent charted very impressively on domestic charts besides on Bugs, but they have charted on Billboard 200 several times and even that charting has gained the attention of knetz because they are impressed at their global popularity, but knetz still dont give them a chance just because they arent from the big 3/hybe. Knetz have shown many times that they know who ateez are, they just dont care to support them because of company name. Of course theres nothing wrong with being more popular career overseas, *I* never said there was, all I said was that they are not nearly as unknown as you are trying to make them out to be.",

Seventeen and nct have had more entertainment exposure and i assume have been around longer so most people would have at least heard of them. Boy groups in general have very little influence in Korea rn so it's not a knock against any of those groups or their members... these are just facts and it's nothing to be offended about lol",

Idk how to word it lol): When SHINee comebacks and ZB1 debuts they\u2019re definitely gonna make noise\n\nEdit: also,, I feel like every time G-idle has a comeback they\u2019re a #1 group again so they\u2019re hot too\n\nEdit2: after seeing what you added the only ones I don\u2019t agree with are Twice, &amp; NMIXX. Twice are huge but not \u2018hot\u2019 per-se? Since they\u2019ve just been around for so long they haven\u2019t had a comeback recently that\u2019s been hot(maybe pop but that was a solo?) and NMIXX haven\u2019t really had a chance to blowup/shine among 4th gen ggs, Love Me Like This was a good start to that so maybe w/ their next comeback \n\nI also feel like with NCT it\u2019s like a mixture of Twice/G-idle, they\u2019ve been around for so long that they aren\u2019t fresh news or hot per-se but every time they have a comeback they\u2019re #1 news again",

BTS is always \u201chot\u201d but right now not doing much as a group, so they probably shouldn\u2019t be mentioned. I personally am falling in more and more with SKZ. They aren\u2019t BTS but they tend to be similar to the BTS I enjoy but even more experimental and almost EDM at times. They are killing it and I think they are close to really exploding.  5-Star has a bunch of fun songs that are the type you like on the first listen. They are good at making things that immediately grab you rather than requiring you to let it grow on you. Change ups in pace and style are something I like. God\u2019s Menu is the perfect example for them.",

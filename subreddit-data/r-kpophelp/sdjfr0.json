I'm not a SVT stan but they are one of the few groups who take advantage of large numbers for interesting formations and so I watch all their dance practices solely for that. Most of my favorite choreos are bc they have unique formations and have nothing to do with the actual dance. \n\n100% agree on your second point though. Although I love Dream (and I guess this could be my \"why are you booing me\" opinion), but they should've stuck to the graduation scheme and continued to shuffle in new members by using Dream as the gateway group. And then continuing to distribute to new units after they graduate. It would erase concerns with the introduction of new members before forming entirely new units (as I am sure SM is grappling with currently for NCT Japan). Of course SM (and us fans) couldn't deny the profitability of the current Dream lineup, I just wish they formed a new unit with the same members after inducting new trainees into Dream. \n\n(sorry for hijacking this comment with my own opinion, my bad)",

I love Ravi as an artist but why does he get so much praise just for getting his artists on random YT shows?\n\nLike why are people fans of CEOs. I would drop my faves if they set up their own companies. Everyone wants their faves to cancel their contracts and start their own company so they can have total freedom or whatever but I think it's super weird.

You just don't know how to run a company or what goes on behind it.\n\nAnti-K-pop people often have a statement saying those companies treat those singers as trash and no as human beings. But that's everywhere on the planet not just the Korean ones. There are some extreme examples, yes. But the same goes usually for any other small company in any other country. \n\n\"Ooh, SM mistreated EXO again.\", \"Because EXO said they thought about leaving, they must have no control over anything they do. They can't voice their opinion.\"\nYet they had this statement on a non-live TV show. And so has the rest of the SM artist also been able to freely criticize their company.\nBesides them renewing their contract again, which means they very much like their position in the company. \n\nThis can be applied to every major company and their artist.\n\nBesides people just somehow always see a company being run by just the CEO and some managers?, like what? There're many other people in charge within the company, so certain decisions are definitely not as simple as you think. \n\nI'm always just so flabbergasted by the simple mind of fans. They say a company must do this and that like they've run a huge company of themselves for 40+ years.\n\nLike, their main group might've made a choice they didn't want a comeback this season. Yet the CEO gets criticized for it? \nI get that they're a spokesperson, but holymoly. People sometimes think that a single man just hates one member and that's why they're 'not getting the treatment they need' and hence are not part of a comeback. \n\nIt's insane to me that people actually think it's that simple.",

I don't care if my favorite idol talks about songs they made that were rejected and I don't whine about \"mistreatment\" based on biased translated hearsay, I'm honestly as neutral as I can be when it comes to the commercial side of things because that's just how the world and the industry works.\n\nSo I guess I meant more specifically that companies are bad because they can never be good or even neutral. And I dislike the idea of \"measuring\" a company's \"good\"ness when it's not an individual entity that can be judged like a person. It's a bunch of business guys no one knows making decisions in a closed room that aren't simple enough to be categorized as \"good\" or \"bad\" decisions because we as consumers of their products/services 1. don't know the big picture; and 2. are biased towards our own ideas of what's \"good\" for the artists.\n\nAll companies are bad because good ethics don't make a profit, and how bad/good they are when it comes to management of their artists can't be measured based on fans' whims.\n\nSomehow we use the word \"bias\" constantly but aren't aware of how it affects us.

Lip syncing to track is lip syncing to track whether that track was recorded two months, two days, or two hours ago. \n\nSinging really quietly over the track which has the main vocal on it is not a live vocal performance. If it has the main vocal on it then it is not a backing track. It is a track. If I am struggling to hear you or distinguish you from the track vocals, then you do not get credit for singing live.",

I once saw some stats about fan demographics for a number of girl groups (let\u2019s see if I can dig them up), and they basically showed that the groups with cutesy or sexy concepts were more popular with men, whereas most other girl groups actually have more female fans or an equal number of both. The really interesting one was TWICE, who had a vast majority of male fans when they did their cute concept at the start of their career but now have more or equal female fans. (This fact in and of itself merits\u2026. a heck of a conversation abt the nature of the male gaze for sure.)\n\nI also remember seeing this Reddit AMA from a Korean guy in the military and who he thought were super popular, and I remember a majority of them being groups that had either sexy or cute concepts. AOA was a big one at the time, and Lovelyz.\n\nGirl crush/appealing to female fans is definitely at the forefront at this point imo - and yeah there may be male gazey elements, but you can also tell there is a shift based on song topics with some groups, as in who they are singing to - eg. Itzy\u2019s whole thing about self love which seems to be more female focused/neutral.",

Cause female fans tend to be more loyal and dedicated.\n\nThe vast majority of gg\u2019s now have female dominated fanbases (especially internationally, but even in Korea), so I don\u2019t know why this narrative that gg\u2019s in general mostly target the male gaze or male audiences is still so prevalent.

Most main vocalists shouldn\u2019t be main vocalists simply because they can sing a high note.\n\nI never realized that most KPop groups vocalists lack technique because fans will make you believe they were the greatest vocalists to ever grace the earth but if you pay close attention, most KPop artists, both male and female, doesn\u2019t have strong technical skills. And it shows mostly when they sing comfortably (not moving around) and their voices are extremely shaky and pitchy. Having a solid technique should be the focus of training over uniqueness and \u201cthey\u2019re the best among this group of people so they get the Mainers position.\u201d\n\nAlso companies need to stop giving them more than they can handle.

Outside of kpop, if you liked 1 group only AND it happened to be the most popular group, you were considered a basic, poser, sheep with no taste. It was the people with the widest variety of groups \"you've probably never heard of\" that touted it as if it was a badge of individuality and breaking free from the mainstream. But in kpop, so many people try to be part of the biggest fandom, reduce themselves to liking one group only as some sign of \"loyalty\", and mock anyone who goes outside of what everyone else is doing. And they wear all this like a badge of pride and to show how cool they are for being part of the big popular kids club. It's hilariously opposite worlds. I guess it was only a matter of time before the hipster elitists showed up in kpop too.",

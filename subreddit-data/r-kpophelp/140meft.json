    "postText": "Context: I am making a kpop playlist inspired by Vanessa/Ursula in the new live action Little Mermaid film. The vibe I am looking for is the lalala part she does with Ariel's voice in front of the mirror after tricking Eric. I already have a few but I'm sure there are many that I missed :)\n\nWhat kind of songs am I looking for? Songs with maybe a bit slower tempo that sound dark, alluring, sensual (maybe even sexy) or evil that you feel like you were \"hypnotised\" by the melody or the voices. With great vocals (vocal runs, harmonizing or highnotes). Bonus points if it has lalala in it as well lol. The lyrics is not the top priority, more so the vibes. You can suggest songs by female and male artists/groups as well \\^\\^\n\nExamples that made my list: EXO - Sweet lies, Dreamcatcher - Red Sun\n\nThank you!",

I am really grateful for everyone who took their time to think about my question. I got many suggestions so I changed the flair but if you still have a song that you think really fits, you are welcome to comment here or message me. \\^\\^",

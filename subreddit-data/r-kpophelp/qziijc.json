    "postText": "Ask me any questions about K-pop or K-pop groups! I\u2019m happy to answer any questions with an open mind/Korean perspective. My English isn\u2019t perfect so if something doesn\u2019t make sense just let me know \ud83d\ude02\u263a\ufe0f\n\nEdit: Some questions are hard for me to answer since I don\u2019t know too much about the group or don\u2019t want to spread misinformation \u3160\u3160 Will message my friends and get back to you. I\u2019m not ignoring you haha.\n\nEdit 2: Please be patient because I try to reply to everyone \u263a\ufe0f Meanwhile if you\u2019re curious who I listen to these days they are: Heize, Jukjae, and Oh My Girl\n\nEdit 3: Taking a break and will answer replies ASAP. \u3147.\u3147\n\nEdit 4: I\u2019m going to more brief with my comments \u3160\u3160 I didn\u2019t expect so much response. Please be understanding \u3131\u3145\u3131\u3145\n\nEdit 5: There is another redditor (Korean American living in Korea) who is also accepting questions! I\u2019m sure they could provide a different perspective or could provide more info on kpop groups who I don\u2019t have much knowledge on: https://www.reddit.com/r/kpophelp/comments/r03ckd/ask_your_kpopindustry_questions/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nEdit 6: I\u2019m going to stop replying because I\u2019m exhausted + have other things to do \u3160\u3160 I might do this again next week for those who I didn\u2019t have a chance to respond c: A lot of people are very curious about Korean culture + cultural appropriation topics so I might start a Q&amp;A about it. Thank you so much for the love and questions \u3145\u3139\u314e \u2764\ufe0f (I love you).\n\nEdit 7: been asked to provide proof that I\u2019m a k-fan and live in Korea so here it is: https://imgur.com/a/4NxZ4ky (don\u2019t know why I have to do this but it\u2019s for your sanity).",

The Boyz is huge in Korea and no one can deny their talents. I\u2019ve never heard that they\u2019re a visual group but they got big due to good comeback times and luck. day6 is the most popular band in Korea right now and their music is just very accessible to the general public.

Also ONF often get recommended for good bsides, so that sort of became their reputation as well.\n\nIn addition, Moscow Moscow was one of the songs mentioned in VIXX\u2019s Hongbin\u2019s disastrous drunk live. People heard it and were defending it as a great song. \n\nBeautiful Beautiful had great timing as when people were tuning in for Brave Girls\u2019 Rollin, they saw ONF performing before, and a lot of Brave Girls fans/other listeners liked how uplifting and happy the song was. Plus IU shared their performance of her song on Insta, getting her fans to check out Beautiful Beautiful as well in the process.\n\nIn terms of memes: [Wyatt embarrassing himself at Gongcha](https://www.instiz.net/pt/6561805), Hyojin\u2019s Seoul Satoori videos, Hyojin\u2019s Wife on Seventeen Seungkwan\u2019s legendary Kpop Lecture Vlive, [Etion\u2019s BuriBuriEtion meme](https://twitter.com/sidewalkfight/status/1296086915863597056?s=21) (there\u2019s a mashup with Itzy\u2019s Chaeryoung popping off on Youtube), Etion\u2019s Pat and Mat stuff with SF9 Jaeyoon, [random video of MK accidentally turning on a song with cursing in the intro on Vlive](https://youtu.be/95a9wTYJOxY), honestly Etion going viral on twitter for random things very often, and little things like that built up people\u2019s (mostly just Korean kpop fans) awareness of ONF little by little!",

If I study in a cafe, I always here dolphin, Dun Dun Dance, and nonstop playing in the background. I\u2019m a huge fan and absolutely adore them. However, Oh My Girl has very big mainstream appeal but doesn\u2019t have a strong fandom. Idk how to explain this but it\u2019s like they\u2019re loved by the general public but most are casual listeners. So they don\u2019t have a big dedicated fandom but it\u2019s still growing in Korea. They sort of have Lovelyz\u2019s opposite problem which is very popular to the general public but small fandom. Can anyone tell if they\u2019re popular internationally? It doesn\u2019t seem like it which I don\u2019t get it.",

They are definitely one of the popular Korean artists that are not very well known internationally - but they have toured US and Brazil, where the fans were singing along to every single song!! They might not have big fandom but there are dedicated fans around the world :) thank you for sharing your opinion!",

They\u2019re one of the only Kpop group who maintained their popularity after a member passed away (RIP Jonghyun \u3160\u3160\u3160\u3160\u3160). I thought Shinee was done after seeing what happened to Kara, F(x), and Ladies Code - and I\u2019m glad Shinee pulled through. They\u2019re one of the older gen groups who still chart very well. This is a huge accomplishment because most BG don\u2019t chart at all. Overall, Shinee is an icon and Korea loves them. I just wanted to include that Key has been getting a lot of hate from K-netizens so please show him some love!",

Most of my friends fell for them after Kingdom as well. \n\nTo answer your question: it\u2019s true that Ateez isn\u2019t well known to the general public but they\u2019re slowly gaining more Korean fans. Most of my younger friends (\ud6c4\ubc30) who are in high school know Ateez so they\u2019re not completely unknown. I think the best way to put it is Kpop fans know Ateez but those who don\u2019t listen to Kpop don\u2019t know them. I think if a few members have the opportunity to appear in variety, they\u2019ll be bigger in Korea.",

One thing I want to point out to I-fans is that Lisa is more popular internationally than domestically. Her singles didn\u2019t chart very well in Korea and none of my K-fans or the general public seem interested in her solo music.

Although Brave Girls is widely known, they don\u2019t have a strong domestic fandom. I would say they have more casual listeners + people who like to root for the underdog. This has a limit on how they can be sustainable as a group. The problem with groups who rose really quickly to the charts for being viral is that they also fall really quickly. A popular example is Crayon Pop. Despite this I hope Brave Girls can quickly develop a strong domestic fandom so they have long lasting careers \ud6d7\u3145.\u3145",

I think their sound is very westernized (not a bad thing but just different) and the general public don\u2019t feel attached to it. One thing for sure is God\u2019s Menu is a banned song among Korean students when they\u2019re studying for the college entrance exam (\uc218\ub2a5). The song is really catchy and the dudududu hook is really catchy and can\u2019t leave one\u2019s head haha. This sort of illustrates that they have a good following among students which is a good thing. They have a solid (not huge) fanbase in Korea and think tv appearances will help them more for exposure to the general public.",

I know they were really popular, but I just want to see *how* popular, and if Gain is in fact more popular than the group themselves. What are their biggest/most well-known hits in Korea?\n\nAlso, how popular are they now 15 years after debut?",

Gain lost a lot of fans after her drug controversy and I haven\u2019t heard much from her after that. Even today I still hear Abracadabra on the radio c: Hope this helps",

I don\u2019t know much about Xiumin\u2019s variety appearances so maybe you can share them here so others and myself can appreciate his variety talents ^^ I will be making a shinee post soon because I have a lot to say haha",

    "postText": "Hi guys. I don't know if my post is allowed.  Sorry for my awful English, I'm french.\n\nLong story short, I was affected a lot by his suicide. I was in depression and feeling highly suicidal myself when he passed away. Thankfully I feel way better and was able to fly to South Korea and go to his memorial. \n\nWhen I look at YouTube comments I see fans saying \" if only we knew we could have saved him \". No you couldn't. Some Fans did know about his depression and struggles.  (foreigners sometimes seem to forget that Koreans fans... speak Korean) \n\nI feel like those people don't really know about depression. It makes you feel lonely, empty, useless. He killed himself because he lived with depression for years, not because his fans didn't realise. We weren't close friends or family, we didn't know him on a personal level. We couldn't do anything. That may sound hard for some of us, but it's the truth. Idols aren't friends or family.\n\nI have some trouble to put worlds on my opinion and I would like to know if people share mine, obviously more developed. Any respectful opinion about Jonghyun is welcome anyway. I feel like it's been enough time for people to calm down and talk about it.",

Like what Cloud9 said when she got the note days prior, their response to help him only \u201cprolonged the inevitable, but didn\u2019t stop it\u201d.\n\nI guess people have to understand that people with depression ranges from mild to severe cases, some may be caused by low social connections and others are too chronic and be caused by something traumatic. It\u2019s not just all about being sad.  It\u2019s something that goes deeper than that, it\u2019s a void in someone\u2019s heart which no one could fill but just them.  I still believe it could be reversed and cured- with psychological help,  medications and/or peer support but it won\u2019t work if that person has lost the will to get better. \n\n\nLike what you said, we don\u2019t know what happened behind the scenes, he may have gotten support in a lot ways already. I am pretty sure his members, friends and family know.  But the dynamics in Korea is different, I think mostly in Asia, where discussing mental issues is taboo.  The way \u201csupport\u201d is given is different between countries. People with depression can get better, but they can get relapses too.  But in the end,  others\u2019 ways to help can only do as much, our maximum effort to help him won\u2019t be enough if he who is suffering does not want to anymore. \ud83d\ude2d",

Even his psychiatrist failed to make him feel that he isn't sick and assure him that everything wasn't his fault.\n\nSadly, despite losing him, Sulli, and Hara, a lot of pathetic Koreans still push some K-Pop artists to the edge by spewing unnecessary hate. They seem to never learn.\n\n(Okay, not just Koreans do that, but those who they attack perfectly understand the language, unlike hate comments expressed in English.)",

I'm Canadian and at that age I had an amazing support system. I was on medication, I saw a therapist, and I had friends and family who constantly checked on me and told me they love me.\n\nI still tried to kill myself.\n\nI don't listen to SHINee but I genuinely think that Korea having a different outlook on mental health *would not have saved him*. Yes, Korea/Asia/the world's perception of mental health needs to change, but no matter the circumstances, people *can* and *will* try to kill themselves if they are at that point.\n\nIt's fucked up, it's not fair, but that's mental health for you.",

I'm not from Korea, but I'm from another country that also think mental health issues are taboo and that seeing psychiatrist or psychologist is a sign that you are weak and cannot figure out your problem by yourself. Because of this stigma, I know some friends and colleagues who really really don't want to go to see professionals even though they need help because they don't want other people in general think of them as weak. This also makes them downplay their feeling and hinders them to tell friends and families.\n\nEspecially with how idol is portrayed and sold nowadays in Korea, I don't think they actually have total support from the mass when they have mental health issues. Yes he did talk about his problem, but I imagine there were people who still attacked him because of it. And I think as long as this stifling stigma still stands, there will always be people who will deliver hate messages to people that has the same problem and less people who seek for help even though they need it. South Korea has one of the highest suicide rate in Asia and even in the world, and that's a fact, and there must be a reason behind it. \n\nSo, I agree that people will still try to kill themselves if they are at that point. But I believe that SK view of mental health definitely plays some role, even though I can't say how significant or insignificant it is. I just hope that a better view and understanding of mental health will reduce the number of people that will get to that point.",

            "comment": "Hi! I\u2019m a psychology student and at least I understand a bit about depression. It could last a life time I know but there are methods to lessen it, to lessen the doubt about oneself. I get that you\u2019re sad because of Jonghyun\u2019s incident, everybody does, even me, and I am not his fan. I felt like crying when I\u2019ve heard of the sad news. I am aware how people with depression works because once, I was almost there but it\u2019s great that I\u2019ve overcome it.\nIn all situations, we could say to anyone with depression to say what\u2019s on their mind to someone they\u2019re close with but I guess that doesn\u2019t work for everyone but we have to vent what we feel without being judged. You vent on people, they think you\u2019re delusional, they think that you\u2019re just overreacting but people doesn\u2019t have the same coping mechanism. For now, if you\u2019re not on meds yet, I could give you a tip to relax your mind. One is try having a secret journal. You should write everything in there, your anger, your thoughts, everything you hate about the world. It helps lessen the burden in your chest because even if no one listens, your journal would. Just make sure no one sees it because it could add up to your worries if other people could read it. For now, since you\u2019re not okay, you have to keep it and when better days comes, you can look back to it and see if there\u2019s a progress in what you feel. Second is listen to hypnosis. Self hypnosis is available on youtube and they could help you with relaxation technique. It would also help you fall asleep quickly because their voice is soothing. You just follow what they say and swim in the deepest of your unconscious mind. I am not telling you to move forward from Jonghyun\u2019s death because one day, you\u2019ll be able to do it. For now, I just want to wish that you live a long life. No. I want you to live a long life. I may be a stranger on the internet but you matters to me. You do or I won\u2019t be sending this long message here. To everyone out there who suffers the same, if I could help you, you could message me. I\u2019ll gladly listen without judgment. I\u2019ll gladly help. Lot\u2019s of love.",

When I come across him on my feed, I\u2019ll smile for him before I remind myself he\u2019s never going to come back, even if I was a fan of him before he died. I\u2018m not blaming myself for his death, it just makes me sad that someone who could understand how so many others feel didn\u2019t have people who knew him and understood how he felt enough to comfort him and be by his side.\n\nI\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019m depressed myself, although I am seeing a counselor. Sometimes when I feel down I would think: is this how he felt too? I will never know myself. It\u2019s just me wishing I could be there by his side, but I can\u2019t, so there\u2019s that. I\u2019m still young so I think I have a pretty immature and limited view of death. I didn\u2019t feel sad for my grandparents\u2019 deaths since I have to take a day to travel to them and I therefore didn\u2019t really get to know them, plus it felt natural since they were getting old with a few health problems. It gets weird since I\u2019m more attached to a stranger than my own family members, but of course, Jonghyun is a stranger who took a lot of time to connect to the world, and his death just seemed so sudden. \n\nActually, when my sister told me about his death that day, I simply brushed it off and told myself not to feel sad about it, and to avoid SHINee. Then, I thought feeling sad was being weak, I guess. But then I found out about Taemin through superm, and it was like a downward spiral into stanning SHINee. Except upwards, they made my days better. I\u2019ve always wanted to apologise somehow for my reaction then. I promise I\u2019ve grown a lot since then, especially since Jonghyun reminded me that being sad was not being weak.\n\nThat being said, this post is probably more suited for r/kpopthoughts (like shower thoughts and discussions but not rants, those belong in r/kpoprants) or r/SHINee.  r/kpophelp is more for random questions about a song you want to know the title of etc. or light hearted discussions about what songs recommended etc.",

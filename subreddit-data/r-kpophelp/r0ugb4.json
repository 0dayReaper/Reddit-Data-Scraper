    "postText": "I am a K-fan living in Korea~~ Comment your idol and I\u2019ll give them stars based on their current popularity in Korea. Again, this is popularity based on what the general public thinks, not fandom. \n\nPLEASE INCLUDE THEIR NAME AND THE GROUP THEY\u2019RE IN. If they\u2019re a solo artist then you don\u2019t have to mention their group. \n\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f  = household name/everyone knows the mentioned idol/high brand reputation and recognition \n\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f = popular but not a household name/most Koreans know the mentioned idol/decent brand reputation and recognition \n\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f = semi-popular but not a household name/ 50/50 chance of a Korean able to recognize the mentioned idol/okay brand reputation and recognition \n\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f = not very popular/ barely any Koreans recognize the mentioned idol/ bad brand reputation and recognition \n\n\u2b50\ufe0f = unknown/ no one will recognize the mentioned idol/ brand reputation and recognition nonexistent \n\nThis is very hard to be objective and accurate but I\u2019ll do my best. I got a lot of questions about individual idols in my last reddit post so wanted to do this. FYI \u2014 this is just a post to inform non K-fans about what the general public thinks. It\u2019s supposed to be informative and not insulting*** If any fan is insulted by the stars I give them \u2014 I apologize in advance. \n\nIf I don\u2019t know the idol well, I will ask my friends and research them on Naver, new sites, and internet forums. Again, this is domestic popularity, not international popularity. \n\nFYI - my English isn\u2019t perfect so please be understanding c:",

You say it is hard to be objective, i respect that honesty because as a single person it seems very difficult to gauge this!  \nYour post is interesting to me because what one generally hears is that kpop idols really are not that popular amongst the general public (general public meaning people outside the kpop demographic, so teenagers and young adults in the early to mid 20s)  \nYet you rate quite a few kpop idols with 5 or 4 stars, which suggests that most koreans would know them. I am just curious if you could elaborate a little how you try to evaluate these idols into your system, thanks for your effort!",

I really appreciate this comment because I came up with a point system because I got a lot of comments last time and wanted to a have a chance to respond to everyone (Im ambitious \u314b\u314b) this time. First, I want to elaborate on the point system. I looked into several factors: 1) How popular was the group overall; 2) Do they have long lasting successful careers?; 3) Did they appear on popular K-dramas and K-variety shows?; 4) How frequently does the Korean press write about them?; 5) Do they go viral on Korean websites and Korean media? \n\nI look into these factors when I holistically and with the best of my ability give out a star point. In Korea, even if you\u2019re not a follower of KPOP, if a KPOP idol or group does well in the following criteria I mentioned before they become aware of their name. Idk if I answered your question but I did so with the best of my ability. If something is unclear, please let me know! \n\nAlso, I know this system isn\u2019t perfect but it\u2019s just meant to be a glimpse of what a K-fan thinks. It\u2019s also my best way to relay what the Korean public thinks!",

So you wouldn't agree with the idea that kpop idols are not that famous / popular among non kpop fans? It's very suprising to hear tbh, because the usual narrative says that idols are the least famous and respected amongst the general public when it comes to celebrities (actors, athletes, comedians, etc way more popular and known).  \nJust one extra question regarding this, would you say that if one asked random koreans on the street, trying to ask people among all demographics (so teenagers, 20s, 30s, 40s, etc) that they would probably know the idols you rated 5 and 4 stars?  \nThanks for your time!",

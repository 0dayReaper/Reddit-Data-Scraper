    "postText": "Tickets: https://imgur.com/a/nbEckAn\n\nIs fanclub the same as Vip?\n\nI bought gidle tickets through the Fox Theater website since they don\u2019t sell the Atlanta tickets on ticket master.\n\nOn the website it says \u201cVip\u201d and all the benefits below it. I did presale, but it was weird, so I couldn\u2019t choose vip specifically, just random seats for random prices.\n\nI also couldn\u2019t choose specific seats, just the amount I wanted. \n\nI got 4 tickets in the same areas but a bit separated. Like 2 in LRD section bb and 2 in LRE section cc.\n\nThe 2 in bb say \u201cmarque club\u201d which is a thing through fox theater and not for the tour/idle.\n\nThe 2 in cc say \u201cfan club\u201d which is a thing for the tour/idle. It has no details on/with the tickets though as to what this means. I was wondering if it was the vip tickets or something different.",

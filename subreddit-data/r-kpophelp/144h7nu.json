    "postText": "Hi, as the title suggests I am looking for an old song (+15 years, maybe?) where a Korean guy did a cover of a song. the original song was by a black guy who had a high-pitched voice and the song mentioned him having trouble sleeping or getting over a girl or something to that effect. I was randomly going about my day until this very nostalgic song popped into my head but for the life of me, cannot remember the name of said song! please help, thanks.",

    "postText": "I have VIP standing for Agust D and was wondering how early I should start lining up for the verification booth. If I understood it correctly, being one of the first ones to get verified also automatically allows you to go inside the venue as one of the first people. I\u2019m not planning on camping or whatever (I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not even allowed), but as I have a hotel room nearby, I\u2019m willing to show up there at 5 or 6am or so. Have any of you had any experiences in the past with BTS Seoul concerts? I know their venue pits have been mostly seated, but maybe someone still knows when people usually started lining up \ud83e\udd72",

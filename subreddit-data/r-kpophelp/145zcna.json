Hell, I was introduced to them when I still was in high school, and that was around 7 years ago xD \nWith all the new debuts and the new gen, it\u2019s normal that their popularity decreased a bit, but I think that they still do well since I\u2019ve seen people mentioning them here and there in kpop subreddits",

Although they still have sold out world tours so it's all relative hahaha  \nHowever their Korean popularity has blown uppppp since 2020 and they're easily a top 5 boy group in Korea, and are one of the very few that even chart on Melon consistently. They're also on so many tv/radio shows and are ambassadors to various brands. Monsta X themselves have said that they're at a career high now",

Their last comebacks have charted moderately well, album sales are consistent and the members have done plenty of variety or solo ventures. They still have so much potential to grow within Korea but it does feel like their international fandom has declined a lot from where it used to be. I've become a closeted Monbebe because I rarely see the group talked about nowadays :(",

Also Monsta X will always be friends they are soulmates, recently in Jooheon\u2019s turn on \u2018The Lights\u2019 documentary he talked about how mx are attached by a red string. Also Monsta X\u2019s wish on the same sky and Wonhos losing you are about each other, both those songs are bittersweet\ud83d\udc96\n\nEta: it is definitely not a bad time to start stanning them!!

Wonho leaving the group hit their popularity, with some people refusing to stay with OT6 but they have released consistently good music since. Obviously now they have started their military service so we will have to see how that affects them.",

So on one hand, they could take the risk of offending a sizable chunk of their fanbase for basically no upside. On the other hand, they could just not use the word, and there\u2019s no chance of anyone getting upset. So, they just don\u2019t use the word.",

Some sites, radios etc bleep it. \n\nThat being said it still doesn\u2019t give the right for non black people to use it under any circumstances as it is a racial slur reclaimed by them.\n\nObviously, there will be non black people who still use it but the shouldn\u2019t get mad when they face the consequences of their actions by the group of people they hurt/offended.",

And knowing that there will be people posting clips online further requires the performer to be more aware of trying to ensure they respect as many people as possible who may come across the video.",

    "postText": "I'm looking for that one kpop song where a male singer sings \"what you want what you need i deliver\" in the refrain (or maybe it was the other way around with \"what you need what you want i deliver\").\n\nI think it was a mixed band whose dance video i saw on youtube but not sure abot the mixed part. It especially stuck because the male singer dropped his voice deeper for the \"i deliver\" part. I can't remember much but please help me find it!",

    "postText": "So today I was in an electronic store and there was this one kpop song playing on loop on some of the large TVs\n\nI don\u2019t know the group name, but it is a big girl group probably 7-10 members. The music video looks older. i would assume 1st or 2nd generation.\n\nIt starts off with a member on the train with someone in a man-shaped lion costume. I believe the chorus starts with: \u201cTell Me Why....\u201d\n\nI am bad at explaining things, so i apologize if this doesn\u2019t seem accurate!",

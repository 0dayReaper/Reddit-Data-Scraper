No one who isn't supposed to be there can be there. \n\nThat of course doesn't stop their classmates from taking photos of them of course, but that's different. (My bias in a group goes to an arts school rn and we don't get fantakens of him but his classmates and other Hanlim kids post photos of him and tell stories and such)",

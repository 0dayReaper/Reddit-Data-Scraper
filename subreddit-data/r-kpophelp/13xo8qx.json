    "postText": "This is something I really wanna share and ask for help, I'm going to be fully honest. Okay, around 1.5 years ago I kinda got to know Enhypen, I already knew about them and the survival show and stuff but never really watched it. But then suddenly one day, I saw this one clip of Jake getting pranked by the members on his birthday and I kinda felt bad for him. I started digging them more and I pitied Jake even more becuase he was kinda the least popular so I decided to make him my bias since I kinda felt familiar with him. The thing is I kinda didn't really vibe with others like a normal fan, I still haven't yet watched their mvs properly because I get this weird shy feeling that keeps me away. I have never considered myself a full fan, who watches their stages, cheer for them or watch their reality shows, but it's only with them not with other groups I don't know why. I kinda avoided them whenever they were in my feed, then I kinda obsessed over a few members for a while, like I was keep thinking about them. And for a while I thought I'm getting better and becoming a fan finally, until they announced their latest comeback Dark Blood, the moment I knew about the concept film, I felt weird and again started avoided them, and now i can't even get myself to watch the mv of Bite Me. It's really really disturbing because I feel so dark, I always wished to stan them like any other normal Engene. I get teary whenever I think about this whole thing. I've always been chill and homely with other groups and idols in my whole kpop life but their case is so messing me up. Plus I think I have this whole thing against the Hybe groups, not in a hating manner but just that they seem so out of reach and I compare myself to their groups especially New jeans since they are around my age. I feel like as if I don't deserve to like or stan Hybe group, they feel too fancy and I get insecure idk. I'm seriously not hating on anyone please try to understand my concern. My feelings are very unexplainable but I tried my best to put them in words.\n\nEdit- Please i hope you'll understand that I'm not trying to hate or attack the group in any way possible, I tried my best without sounding rude, expressing my feelings that I've been surpassing, I myself feel so awful, I can't hate on them or anything. If I offended any of you in any way, I'm very apologetic for that.",

Try and keep it casual as a fan and just enjoy the music.\n\n3. Learn more about them maybe by watching En O Clock. You'll realise they're just a group of goofy, funny guys.\n\nIt's hard to understand what the root of your problem is. Is it a type of jealousy?",

I'm being very weird and I hate myself for that.",

Perhaps during a break you'll realise what causes the negative feelings. Their music and content will still be there if you want to return in the future. Don't put any pressure on yourself. \n\nIf the root is jealousy then maybe look into steps you can take to make yourself feel more confident and at peace. That could be therapy or something like a new hobby outside of K-pop.",

I really like Heeseung and Sunoo from the group, but none of the others really catch my attention. There is nothing wrong with only liking one member of the group, as long as you aren't putting the others down. Who knows, in a few years, you may gravitate more toward Jake and start to bias some of the other members, as well.",

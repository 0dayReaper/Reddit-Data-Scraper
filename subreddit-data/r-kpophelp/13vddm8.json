I'm trying to make it less scary to me by knowing people that have gone through it.\n\nI'm **not** asking about plastic surgery, not trying to have that discourse here lol but if they've talked about it openly before then that's okay to answer with.\n\nExample: Yoongi had shoulder surgery, Jimin had his appendix taken out etc.",

I remember the pre-op waiting room and the nurse waking me up post-op before wheeling me back to my room. I built it up so much only to have it be a total block in my memory!

From what I know, he still has 7 metal pins in his leg, and is no longer able to perform as a dancer. He usually appears in the last minute of the stage or not at all. \n\nAs for Kyuhyun, he was in a different car accident where his broken ribs pierced his lungs. He was in a coma for days and his career as a singer almost ended because his surgeons suggested repairing his lungs through his throat. Thankfully, his father (who once disapproved of Kyuhyun\u2019s singing career) rejected this surgery and they were able to find an alternative. \n\nDetails are a little fuzzy so ELFs are free to correct me!",

One day the artist is caught plagiarizing another group and when accused, the idol admitted and apologized. \n\nThe group plagiarized is also one of my ults and now I just have a lot of difficulty getting past the plagiarism and even listening to the songs of the idol that plagiarized... but I really like their music and the idol only plagiarized once. So what to do? Has it ever happened to you?\n\nEdit: structures i didn't like.",

There are only so many chords and melodies that can be performed by people on instruments that exist and fewer ones that most humans find enjoyable. You can find modern songs that use the same chords and melodies used in classical music over 2 centuries ago. Memories by Maroon 5 is heavily based on Canon in D is just one example. \n\nThis is an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I&amp;t) done for comedic sake, but you can see how many songs use very siimlar chord progression. I'm aware that these songs shown use the same four chords but in different progression in their actual songs.

(Although these days one of their music isn't really doing it for me so it definitely makes it easier.) \n\nI'm sure the artists have moved past it too and if it doesn't bother the artists much, you've said that they apologized so... I think it's okay to let go of that guilt and just enjoy what you like. If it bothers you a lot though, (and that's valid too!) I suppose you can find other groups to enjoy since there are tons out there and just ignore the group forever. \n\nAlso, definitely stay away from fandom drama. I feel like both sides can get over protective and hyper critical sometimes. \n\n Good luck.",

The song is mainly known for its plagiarism. The producers of Wave could've easily contact KOMCA and change the credits. The song was registered months later after the scandal. Do you actually know what KOMCA is? It's not some random page where you could easily add random people. Do you seriously think that CUBE/Soyeon or Komca didn't contact KQ and the producers for their approval?\n\nEDIT: Also Soyeon or Pop Time can't really take down that song, because it was made for the show. MBC has rights to that song. You can't just randomly delete or simply change a song that was already used for a show, where the trainees who sang that song are already eliminated and don't have any contract obligation to rerecord that song again. MBC even capitalized on that controversy.",

The issue was solved based on the silence between these two.

    "postText": "It's been a while since I've seen Itzy fans on Twitter complaining about JYP's treatment of the group. However, I confess to you that I don't usually take K-pop fans on Twitter very seriously, as we all know that people on this social network tend to be steric and exaggerate real world facts, which are often not real problems.\r  \nI don't follow Itzy's career but I was curious about the situation, so I decided to ask here: is there really a problem with Itzy's management by JYP?\r  \nI remember seeing fans mention that Itzy today is in the same division that GOT7 used to be within JYP. Is there a problem with this particular division? Including what was the situation of GOT7 with JYP? I confess I didn't follow the group either",

            "comment": "to answer ur last question: jyp does this thing where when a new group debuts he pays less attention to his older groups + got7s contracts expired and they decided not to renew plus they all had other things like jinyoung acting, jackson solos etc. \n\nnow i will confirm both that i am an avid twitter stan and do not follow itzy that close but i cant personally think of anything concerning around them? alls quiet on the western front for now",

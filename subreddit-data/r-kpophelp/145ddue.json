So think how much worse it would be for a preteen idol or adolescent idol whose body and brain are still developing.",

I'm not exactly sure what is causing it, but I think it is probably a mix of my mental illnesses which I am fighting and 15mg of Mitrazipine, but I did sleep this much before the Mitrazipine, too. I also wake up many many times a night, so that adds onto the time",

He had just finished filming an intense solo scene and next thing he knew, he was on the floor. It turns out he was hospitalized for it and ended up with an IV drip to help replenish his fluids.",

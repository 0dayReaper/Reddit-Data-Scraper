    "postText": "Okay so it\u2019s my first time writing on here so if it\u2019s wrong or whatever I\u2019m sorry T~T \n\nYesterday I randomly remembered this K-pop song that i LOVED but i can\u2019t recall the name of the song (the song title was in Korean, there were no English titles in the song tittle) or how it sounds, the artist(s) name(s) we\u2019re also in Korean and not spelt in English. But i remember some parts of the music video. I have searched into the deepest parts of YouTube and i can\u2019t find it. The song was performed by various artist, although I am not sure if it was by a group or if different individual artist collaborated. From what i (barely) remember it was sort of a ballad type song, a slow one, but the vocals were RICH. \n\nThe color gradient of the video was a soft yellow brown. Very similar to Simon Dominic and Loco\u2019s [At Night](https://youtu.be/_iOVHaDxXgM) music video. Even the set of the apartment looks the same. \n\nDetails of music video:\n\nA man (let\u2019s call him \u2018S\u2019) is a police officer and is helping a lady and her child hide from other police officers who (if I\u2019m correct idk) are corrupt. Man \u2018S\u2019 safely takes them into a room (hotel room me thinks) and sits with them in the room with his other partner. All of a sudden corrupt cops barge in, Man \u2018S\u2019 stands and protects lady and child and ends up getting shot and dying. The lady kneels down next to his body and starts crying then the camera pans down and the credits roll in.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that is all I remember. If anybody manages to find it, or know which video I\u2019m talking about or even tried I just wanna say THANKS you\u2019re a life savior.",

It could be a k-ballad or k-indie, k-r&amp;b. It definitely wasn\u2019t a poppy sound nor a k-hip hop. I\u2019m asking the music gods to please put on my ytube timeline. I\u2019m desperate at this point lol \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

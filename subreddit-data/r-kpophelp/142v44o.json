    "postText": "Hello! I have been listening to Le Sserafim a lot these days and Sakura seems to be slowly becoming my bias, and I also found out she's the most biased, most followed on Instagram, and generally seems to be one of the most talked about members in LSRFM discussions.\n\nWhat do you think is the reason behind her popularity? Are fans from Japan and former IZ*One fans hard-carrying her popularity or are there things like viral moments or anything that I may not know of? I'm curious to hear about how her career progressed and what drew fans into her but I know next to nothing about her J-pop days or about IZOne\n\nThank you in advance!",

She got a major push first in Japan to represent HKT/AKB, and then in Korea to attract the Japanese market (Produce48 was basically Sakura's show). Add great visuals + charm + charisma + excellent fanservice and you have a superidol right there.",

            "comment": "This is a question that goes back literally a decade, and the answer is basically \u201cshe\u2019s always been in the right place at the right time.\u201d\n\nAKB48 is a Japanese idol group with a bunch of sister groups. SKE48, NMB48, SDN48, and so forth are all part of the AKB48 groups. Every year, the AKB48 groups would have a national election \u2014 basically a popularity contest between every member of all the groups.\n\nHKT48 debuted as a new sister group in 2011, and its members first participated in the election in 2012. Out of 238 eligible members across the AKB48 groups, the top 64 would place high enough to participate in the yearly single. Only one member from the newly-debuted HKT48 would place in the top 64 that year: 14-year-old Miyawaki Sakura.\n\nA few weeks after the 2012 election, Sashihara Rino was demoted/transferred to HKT48 due to her involvement in a sex scandal. Sasshi had placed 4th in the election that year, a full 43 places higher than Sakura.\n\nThe transfer was presumably intended to punish Sasshi, but it ended up being mutually beneficial to basically everyone involved. Sasshi\u2019s popularity was a massive boost to HKT48 - 5 members placed in the top 64 the following year (up 500%), Sakura placed 26th (21 places higher than the previous year) and Sasshi herself placed 1st, beginning a streak of first place wins that would be (almost) uninterrupted for the next five years. Basically, Sashihara Rino would end up being a kind of figurehead/mentor/unnie to the entire group of HKT48, but especially to its most popular idol, Miyawaki Sakura.\n\nSakura continued to rise in election placements, peaking at 3rd in 2018. In 2019, the election was cancelled indefinitely, so she would never have the chance to place higher. But of course, that didn\u2019t matter anyway: at that point, Sakura had already been shipped off to Korea.\n\nEvery single Japanese contestant of Produce 48 was a member of the AKB48 groups. And because neither Jurina nor Akari participated in the show, the most popular Japanese contestant was Miyawaki Sakura. Because of this, she became the face of the Japanese contestants to the new Korean audience.\n\nIn the first episode, the panel of judges watched each contestant perform a short song and piece of choreo, and then each contestant was given a letter grade A-F. The majority of Japanese contestants placed terribly \u2014 except Sakura. I\u2019m gonna be honest, I\u2019ve seen this episode, and I don\u2019t think Sakura\u2019s performance was really anything special. But probably to throw a bone to the Japanese audience, the judges unanimously voted Sakura into the A tier, making her 1st place, and therefore the center in the show\u2019s theme song, Nekkoya.\n\nAnyway, Produce 48 happened, and Sakura was probably rigged out of winning 1st place. We don\u2019t know for sure, but a bunch of evidence points to Starship *probably* bribing Mnet to make Wonyoung win the show at Sakura\u2019s expense. And to be clear, I don\u2019t have anything against Wonyoung; she was 13 at the time. There\u2019s no way she has anything to do with it. But Sakura probably would\u2019ve won if the votes were counted correctly.\n\nFrom there, the story is one that you\u2019re probably familiar with. IZ\\*One debuted and were massive in both Korea and Japan. When the vote manipulation scandal happened, X1 disbanded, but IZ\\*One stuck around, making them the longest-lasting group from the most popular survival show ever. And as IZ\\*One became more popular, so too did Sakura. She had always been the face of Japan in Produce 48, and she remained the most popular of the Japanese members in IZ\\*One. If you asked someone in Korea to name Japanese idols in 2020, they\u2019d answer \u201cMina, Sana, Momo,\u201d and then \u201cSakura.\u201d They probably still would even now.\n\nIt really is difficult to overstate how popular IZ\\*One were though. They never reached the heights of, say, Blackpink or Twice or Red Velvet, but they were absolutely in the tier below them, alongside groups like Mamamoo and Gfriend.\n\nAnd then IZ\\*One disbanded and everyone was sad for a year. And then it was reported that Sakura and Chaewon had signed with HYBE, and that basically brings us to today. Sakura is now a massive idol in both Korea and Japan, and Le Sserafim was basically built around her and Chaewon. She\u2019s got a variety show and she had a radio show and a gaming channel and she does all the regular promotional stuff that you\u2019d expect an idol to do.\n\nAs a neat final note, Japanese fans have used the word \u201ckami\u201d to describe Sakura due to her popularity in both AKB48 and in IZ\\*One. The word \u201ckami\u201d translates to \u201cdeity,\u201d so that really sheds some light on just how intense her Japanese fandom was.",

Jurina, for a number of factors (including the fact that she was always more popular than Sakura) won by a million miles (but also another girl from Jurina's subgroup SKE won second, and Sakura was third).  so of course this was supposed to be a really happy event for Jurina considering she'd been in this group since she was 11, as being first is massive (even if it took Sasshi bowing out of elections).  but shortly after she won, a video clip from rehearsal (there are performances and stuff while the election event goes on, so presumably for one of those) started to get some traction.  iirc the interpretation of the video was that jurina reprimanded sakura for something (performance-related), and sakura looked really upset about it.  and sakura fans/jurina haters got really heated about it, and jurina was getting killed online, and then suddenly she was on hiatus for her health/mental health at exactly the time when activities were supposed to be centered around her.\n\nEDIT: apparently it was a brief exchange on-stage during an actual performance and not during rehearsal.\n\n[a post with a translation of jurina's explanation/apology for the incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/Produce48/comments/8s6oa0/jurina_apologizes_for_scolding_sakura_during_the/)\n\nand then they did not run it back in the next SSK....",

Their members were literally everywhere in the Japanese entertainment for a good decade, and even today some of the biggest names in Japanese entertainment are former members, including Maeda Atsuko and Sashihara Rino (Sakura's mentor). Sakura and Jurina were pushed heavily by AKB's management to be the new figureheads of the group with the original generation graduating, though AKB's relevance has dropped a lot since then with younger Japanese moving towards the 46 and K-pop girl groups instead.\n\nMost K-pop fans have little idea how many lives Sakura has lived as an idol, and the comment above only scratches the surface of her unbelievable career, from [Sasshi's story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2fgVWPB6ys) to  [Sakura's epic rivalry with Jurina](https://socialgrep.com/post/yfvf38), Produce48, IZ\\*ONE and Le Sserafim. She has already experienced so many highs and lows (she has said there were honestly more difficult moments than happy ones looking back on her career), but even now she's only getting started and the best is yet to come.",

And whose to say that that controversy was the origin point of the Wonyoung hate train when \n\n1.it only became a solid theory when it was revealed that Produce S2- PDX101 were manipulated and before you say it only applied to PDX101, it has been revealed that Chowon (Lightsum) and Lee Gaeun (former After School) didnt make the IZ*ONE lineup in favor of those who were rigged in. \n\n2. this isnt even the first controversy Wonyoung faced. During PD48 she was criticized a lot for \n2.1. side to side performance because she was too young \n2.2everyone was speculating that she had some Chinese blood in her \n2.3. for trying too hard to be like WANNAONE\u2019s Park Jihoon. \n\n3. usually when Wonyoung is criticized, the theory of her being rigged into first place isnt even the usual talking point of haters. And when people mention it, they dont blame her, they blame the company, which is valid because if the theory is true then Wonyoung was 13 she probably had no idea what was going down. And even the person who originally commented did the same. No one is blaming her for it if it were true.",

The reason was I didn't understand why they put her in grade A when it was clear there was a huge skill gap between the Japanese and Korean contestants. That's not meant to be an insult to the Japanese contestants, it's just that the Japanese and Korean idol industries have different expectations for their respective idols. This placement caused a bit of an upset. However, Sakura was graceful, humble, and worked really fucking hard to meet that A standard. And she was so nice to everyone. She just has this self awareness and awareness of people around her. Idk, she just completely won me over and I've only continued to like her more and more as she's continued to grow as an idol.\n\nAnd let's be honest. She's very pretty.",

            "comment": "Luck plays a big role in popularity most times and is sometimes considered to be an idol's greatest skill.\n\nFor Sakura, IMHO, it's a mixture of insane luck and really hard work.\n\nHere are some big moments that I think she deserves to be presented her flowers for: \n\n1.) She secured a main spot in a big hit AKB single within ONE year after her debut.\n\n2.) She was one of the main members HKT's first single - this is honestly where I think she started to get big cause she ended up ranking really high (#11 out of 310 members) in the next year's Sousenkyo (which is a 48G popularity contest voted for by fans).\n\n3.) She got to be a duo center for another hit AKB single in her 4th year of activity with Mayuyu (who is one of THE top centers for the 48G) - this is when she solidified her popularity since she was able to stand her own against some of the top TOP 48G centers like Mayuyu, Sasshi, Acchan, and Yuko (and Jurina).\n\n4.) She was the duo-protagonist alongside Paruru (an AKB fan favorite) in Majisuka Gakuen season 4 - one of the beloved drama series that is affiliated with the 48G.\n\n5.) Near the end of her 5th active year, she was the SOLO center for AKB's 43rd single (which was a big deal since it was the 10th anniversary single for AKB48) which featured graduated members that are considered to be some of AKB's powerhouses as well as a lot of really popular 48G members.\n\n6.) Was able to rank #2 in Produce48 and debuted with IZ*ONE - really putting her out there for the general public.\n\nHaving been in the industry since she was basically barely a teen, she is really good at expressing herself and seems to be a genuine human (observed from what content we've been presented). With idol work, she knows what to do in terms of performance, variety, and fanservice. It's honestly a fun time having to watch and support her journey.",

            "comment": "I can't speak to what knetizens typically like in their idols, but J-Pop idols are very much about watching young girls (or boys) mature and grow over time.\n\nTo that end, really popular idols tend to fall into one of two groups. \n\nGroup 1/ God Given Talent/Natural X-Factor\nIdols who are idols despite the general acceptance that they could be a \"real\" artist. These are the idols that tend to immediately draw attention because even at their very young age, it's obvious they ooze talent/skill/charisma. For Japan, the person I immediately think of is Suzuki Airi who is the \"(former) idol that idols look up to.\" \n\nGroup 2/ The Idol that Exponentially Grew\nThese are the idols that aren't untalented, they are an idol after all, but not necessarily touched by God. I would say Sakura falls into this group. Japanese idol fans love idols who worked really hard and through sheer grit surpass how far their natural talent alone would take them. Sakura is quintessentially this and I think it's buoyed by her *48 past. The *48 groups being _massive_ don't necessarily care about individual talent because it's about the sheer scale of it all, the Woo Girls of How I Met Your Mother, if you will. I think anyone will readily admit that the Sakura on Produce 48 and the Le Sserafim Sakura are two distinctly different idols and the Japanese public/idol culture eats that shit up. Throw the fact that Sakura is doing this in largely a second language that she didn't grow up speaking and you have a recipe for success. \n\n(I will say that Produce 48 on paper is also interesting on its own. Japanese idols tend to debut fairly green/amateurish/unpolished because watching the growth is the bread of butter of Japanese idol culture. This is the opposite of Kpop idols where it's extremely polished from debut so it would've always been hard for Japanese diamond-in-the-roughs to compete against nearly perfect cut/shaped/polished Korean diamonds)",

She knows she's not the greatest in vocals but she still tries her best and honestly vocals are not everything when you're an idol, and tbh she doesn't need to be the best vocalist bc they have yunjin and chaewon for that. Having that natural presence and ability to draw people's eyes is very hard to learn/teach, you just kinda have to have IT, and she absolutely does. \n\nNot to mention she's really sweet to those around her and is very upfront and funny but not in a rude or uncomfortable way.

She has a unique personality and is one of the personalities which I feel really help you to believe in the kindness and genuineness of idols. She also works hard to be a member of Le sserafim and consistently give great performances as well as during produce 48 to earn her spot and consistently improve to try to meet the Korean trainee standards which were seemed extremely far at the start as a Japanese idol. Luck of course is part of everyone's life and making use of it or overcoming it is a good thing, in a way she was unlucky in some ways but she was also lucky too with being on the biggest girl group in Japan, one of the biggest Korean shows, and joining the biggest idol company, it also goes hand in hand with her hard work aspect.",

That kinda ability only comes from so many years of experience and likely the fact she did it in Japan before. JP scene is so heavily focused on the Idol part of the industry while Korea appears leans a little more towards raw ability, performance and metrics (not to say either country doesn't share the other side too). I think that those \"Variety\" skills she has are absolute SS rank, and she performs very well too. Not to mention shifting country and dominating with fans in a whole different setting, lang and culture.\n\nIf you watch her enough to see her in the le sserafim doc or her stuff back in Japan, that girl really just hammers away at absolutely every opportunity and puts 110% of her effort in all the time and [its really endearing to see](https://youtu.be/XaT-GYHTTEM?t=448). She cares, we care - I think shes someone its very easy to want to support in her journey.

I think what I\u2019ve noticed with her is that she already of course came in with a fandom of her own and people were already very excited for her. In the beginning she would trend and make it in high ranks because she was pretty and of course she had the fans backing her up. As time by I think during that show she lost a lot of her confidence and disappeared a bit from the center spotlight but still she was able to rank and debut. I think she has significant improved ever since she got into HYBE however I still find her lacking but I will say that she is very aware of her lackings and she works so hard to improve herself.",

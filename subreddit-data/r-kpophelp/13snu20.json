Stray kids has a lot of sad songs (Lonely St, Waiting For Us, Ex, Mixtape: Oh, Levanter, Sorry I Love You, Secret Secret, Silent Cry, Limbo, Deep End, Gone Away). Some still have relatively upbeat music, so there's that. \n\nThere's some BTS-related ones (Spring Day, Butterfly, The Truth Untold, Stigma, 4 O'Clock, Snooze). There's Lovesick Girls by Blackpink. Jae from Day6 has a bunch of sad songs (Pillows, Sincerely, Pacman, It Just Is, Dive With You). The last two are collabs with Seori and both love songs, I think, but they sound hella sad. I Wanna Cry by Seori is sad too.",

They're not exactly sad, but they can really just drown everything out. Heaven, To., Scenery, and Lost in the City are some of my favourites from them.",

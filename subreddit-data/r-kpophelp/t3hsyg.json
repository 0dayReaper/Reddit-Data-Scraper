    "postText": "There's no META flair but I wanna remind you all\n\n\n**THIS POST IS NOT MEANT TO BRING HATE, ONLY TO INFORM, DO NOT SPREAD HATE TO ANYONE MENTIONED**\n\nA lot of these discussion and questions that go on here are directly being used by Kpop Tiktokers and Youtube Shorts creators to put in their videos so they don't have to do the research. They're just stealing our best answers to make their own vids, just like how Soompi and AllKpop do\n\nIn essence there's nothing wrong as most of them don't make money off of it, but some directly profit off of your answers. If you're fine with that then all power to you, but please be aware that this is a thing that's happening. \n\nI've noticed multiple times that I see a question here and within a day the exact same 2 channels upload a short with the exact title and top answers. I won't call them out directly but they know who they are, and they use the same Reddit account to ask those questions too. \n\nSo please keep this in mind, you're not just helping someone interested in a topic, you're possibly contributing to someone's bank for free\n\n\nEdit: I'll put the one that actually irked me because literally all their videos are from here (check the top questions of this week and check their vids of the past week, exact replicas). The user who asked all those questions is the same too\n\n[Kpopification](https://youtube.com/channel/UC2507Z5YOsfud33imrtj8ug)\n\n\nEdit #2: kpopification has reached out to me in dm's and is trying to set things right with those whose answers they have used. Please understand that not everyone is aware of the ethics around consent. They want to reach out to those whose answers they've used. If you know they've used yours and wish to speak to them, do so respectfully. Their dms are open u/ivenugu \n\nIf anyone starts sending hate towards them I'll remove this because that is not my intention. \n\n**Please mention any other users you see doing this so we can educate them and warn people commenting without realising their answers are being used. Do not spread hate to those who mentioned, this is not a hateful call-out**",

If you notice this happening, it might be worth seeing if you can contact Reddit and ask if they have a proceedure for what to do when noticing this on someone else's behalf.\n\nUsers who personally notice their content being taken by YouTubers should know that other instances of this happening have been resolved via DMCA takedown notices filed against the YouTuber. It is your legal right to file one, if you find yourself on the end of this.\n\n(edit: typos, clarification)",

Plus it's worse if you're earning money out of it. At least give credit where it's due or say you plan to use it in a video so people are aware. \n\nThis whole thing feels like the equivalent of a classmate copying your homework word for word and getting an A+ while you don't get any credit and are standing there like \ud83e\uddcd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f'ayo pal wtf?'",

In 2022 so many of us are so uneducated about copyright, fairuse, and credit, and the legal right we have to our written work. Someone's shameless fanfiction, magnum opus book, Reddit comments... they're all artistic expressions, so to speak, and hence automatically under copyright.

Like many others have stated, if these creators are just honest about why they're asking the questions and credit people that have helped them find research for their vid, that's all good\n\nThat depends on what is actually being refered to. Are you posting the official Gaon data or are you taking info from it and transposing it. If you're just linking the Gaon chart as an answer for stats, it's most likely that creator will use the chart itself for the most accurate stats. If you're responding with sorted data from Gaon, like how some people sort out the best selling songs, that is research they do and they should be credited for that, not Gaon. \n\nIn scientific research, the rules for accurate references (crediting) are very explicit, and in terms of who to credit, the golden rule is who created the quote you're drawing your info from. If someone else requotes the original data, they should mention it is a quote, in which case, you go to the original source and refer to the original, not the person who requoted it",

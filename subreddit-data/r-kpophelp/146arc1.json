    "postText": "Okay so NGL before I ever looked up the lyrics to JikJin... Based solely on the music video, and general feel of the song... I thought it was about being cool and driving fast cars or something (dumb I know but that's the vibe lmao) \n\nI recently watched the lyrics video, and I was like awwwww that's the friggen sweetest sentiment, and such a passionate story of falling in love, and how it can feel surreal and addictive.\n\nVery accurate depiction of what falling for someone is actually like, and I for one, love the song even more xD\n\nAnyways! What are some other great Kpop songs about passionate, intense type love that people might not automatically think of??\n\nThx all\nPedal to the metal, vrooooom!",

He recently graced the over of *Men's Health, Korea* as \"Captain Korea.\" Many use him as their goal body, idol or not.\nMaybe even **Jongho** of Ateez since he's the one in a viral video of \"a singing highschooler who can split apples with his bare hands.\" (He's not in HS anymore; this was pre-debut, I believe).",

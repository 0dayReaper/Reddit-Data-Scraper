    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is my first time asking anything so please let me know if this should be somewhere else or edited (I did read the rules but just in case :) ).\n\nI've followed Kpop for a few years now and I've had the very interested phase and some less interested phases (right now I don't follow any group in particular very closely). But over the years every now and then I'll see a tweet or maybe a tiktok about an some korean fans expressing that they wished idols would not tour overseas or something to that affect.\n\nFirstly, I will state the obvious that I don't think this applies to all K-fans - not even the majority - I think it's a very small minority but nonetheless it's just something I've seen pop up every now and then.\n\nAn example I've recently seen was Taeyong (NCT) posted on bubble saying he wanted to tour and have fun all over the world (I think he specifically mentioned South America) and he then said something like \"don't be upset, Korea is the beginning, 127 Seoul\" which I think implies some korean fans on bubble were saying no stay here rather.\n\nAnother example I can vaguely remember from a while ago is I think on a fancall a K-fan directly expressed that they would be upset when the idol goes on tour (I think it was a Hyunjin from Stray Kids fancall iirc) and the idol replied with saying that they received the question a lot or something similar. And just over the years I think there have been more small situations to the same tune.\n\nI'm from Africa, so I obviously don't understand the Korean POV but I thought that touring would be more a sign of success for the group that you support and want to succeed? And it's something that I think many idols have publicly stated they enjoy because they can perform their music to people who want to enjoy it (which they also do in Korea).\n\nSo my question is as the title suggests, why do certain K-fans seem to dislike groups touring? I could maybe understand if the groups spent so much time overseas that they never got to see them perform when they are supposed to be based in Korea, but that doesn't seem to be the case for almost all of these examples.\n\nIs there context here that I'm missing?\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: This is in reference to some comments under this post. I wanted to clear this immediately. I can't speak to everyone's comment here but I specified *implicitly* that this was not in reference to all korean fans, but a very small minority. This post was also definitely not made with the intention of saying anyone is spoiled or hateful as mentioned in another comment, but asking for context on a situation that has happened a few times.   \nI asked for context because as I said I am not Korean, and as to not speak over anyone I put the question out.\n\nIn the end all of these comments will be based off of what people have seen online from K-fans, and most likely not from k-fans themselves because I don't think this is the platform they usually post on. And as such, should not be regarded as the be-all-end-all of opinions and truth.  \nThat being said, xenophobia obviously has no place in this discussion and I don't expect comments with such an undertone to be made under this post and I am definitely not qualified to speak on it so I hope that this can remain civil. I hope my intentions for this post remain clear and have not caused anyone harm. Thanks",

            "comment": "Because touring would mean less chances of seeing them in Korea. They'd rather the group stays in Korea with 2-3 comebacks in a year, hence more local fansigns events, festival performances, etc., that they can easily go to, rather than just 1 comeback in a year then the rest of the time spend touring everywhere else.",

By the time they try to record their next single/album, they might have depleted their funding on holding small-sized tours for a limited number of fans without gaining enough profit. And it's usually the Korean fans' money and support they have to rely on to fill in the gap - which is not enough.\n\nTo be fair, I've had my fair share of foreign musicians not adding Korea to their world tours - even if they include Japan, Australia or other countries that are equally far away - and having some of the actual Korean tours canceled at the last minute, so I guess it's the same issue everywhere.",

They will say the most entitled and rude things to the members also, about their appearances and so on. But they\u2019re literally just so loud, and they\u2019re pretty much in their own circle together. It\u2019s a very small group. They\u2019re just very noisy and engaged with the fandom since they\u2019re fansites so a lot of international fans let them color their entire perception of korean fans. But it\u2019s literally less than ten people. Not even a majority of their fansites or anything they just somehow overpower them all in noisiness lol.

Wanting to keep something special to you to yourself and not share isn\u2019t always because you dislike or fear who may take some of it from you. If a Kpop artist branches out globally they will have less time to dedicate to their Korean fans. Maybe they spend less time speaking Korean. Eventually, that connection lessens. A fans negative reaction to that isn\u2019t automatically because they dislike or fear foreigners, it\u2019s more like because they dislike their artist having less time for them. In fact, I would even go so far as to say the action of branching out could actually bring about xenophobia. Not the other way around. \n\nIf you have an friend visit town and want to spend a bunch of time with them, but they also made plans with other older friends you don\u2019t know well, maybe that bums you out. You\u2019re not bummed because you dislike and fear those other friends.  You\u2019re bummed because you get less time to spend with your friend. Their attention is spread thinner. \n\nI\u2019m also just sort of tired of seeing people assume the worst in others.

People here would gasp at how much racism and xenophobia were literally taught to me in schools. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s less now, but I\u2019m in my 30s. Unless they learned to question their teachers (who beat us, by the way, I mean physically), there\u2019s a good chance a few of them absorbed that trash and passed it onto their kids, too. I mean, why would you expect Korea to be beautifully inclusive just because they have good music? Japanese occupation was traumatic for Korean society as a whole and it wasn\u2019t even that long ago in terms of history. Most Korean adults had at least one family member who lived through occupation. Then thanks to the Korean War, which killed 5 million people, every Korean male had to go through mandatory conscription. These are things that can damage a society forever and allow for people to think very protectively about it and view outsiders as threatening.\n\nLook at the non-popularity of non-Koreans inside Korea. It\u2019s not all because of xenophobia, but it\u2019s not a non-factor, either. It\u2019s especially glaring with Lisa because she\u2019s the biggest K-pop star globally by a mile, yet the least popular BP member in Korea. Even if some fans necessarily aren\u2019t xenophobic, if brands cater to xenophobia and are more likely to push Jisoo over Lisa, then everyone in Korea is affected by it. It\u2019s hard not to see a racial component. Felix is plenty popular despite being foreign because he\u2019s still considered Korean by blood, though he barely spoke Korean when he first arrived, but even he is not as popular inside Korea as he is outside.",

            "comment": "I don't think it's necessarily gatekeeping like the majority of the comments are saying here. I'm not Korean nor have I been to Korea but I think it's kind of obvious that being an idol fan in Korea comes with being able to see your idols often. During comeback season you get to see them several times a week, for free, at music shows, and this goes on for several weeks, 2-3 times a year. Then you have fansigns, fanmeets, other events outside of comebacks, local concerts, festivals, award shows, end of year shows, radios, mc gigs, regular livestreaming, etc etc. Having your idols be across the world for a huge chunk of time instead of all of that is a pretty new thing for Korean idol fans to have to deal with, but might be hard for intl fans to understand as we have the total opposite experience. \n\nAs an intl fan, I also don't want my groups to be touring all the time because I find it hard to keep up with them. It's obviously great that they tour, they make more money, they see more fans, I get to see some of them because I'm lucky that some of them come to Europe, it's a good thing to tour. But I can't help but feel like I can't wait for it to be over and for them to stay in Korea for a while after so that I can get a steady stream of accessible content again. Having to watch the same concert over and over again for half a year through fancams is boring for me compared to music shows with different fits, variety show appearances, etc etc. I also just find it difficult to keep up with fan based content on social media for more than a few days, especially with algorithms and just the sheer amount of posts, lack of context, poor use of tagging etc. It's probably even more difficult for Korean fans to keep up with considering most of this stuff is in English (with heavy slang) and Korean stan spaces aren't really integrated with intl spaces (depends on the fandom but typically this is how it is).",

When they were really reaching a peak in Korea back in 2013 they left to tour Japan for months, stunting their growth as a group. It\u2019s hard to pick up momentum afterwards too. Tours bring the company a lot of money but at the cost of gaining more fans, and I think for Korea based fans it comes down to a pride thing. Hearing your group everywhere, seeing them in brand deals day to day on the street gives fans a sense of accomplishment to be like \u201cyeah those are my faves\u201d so losing that momentum is hard to see",

While most international fans view global popularity as another form of \"success\", it means nothing if those in the local Korean industry do not know them or if the Korean GP do not support them. Local fans and/or listeners are the first to buy CDs to apply for offline fanmeets, stream their songs on Melon, Bugs, etc. (which are still more influential to the Korean charts than Spotify or Youtube Music), purchase tickets for fanmeet events and concerts, and so on. Think about the costs of buying official merch, CDs or overseas - it does cost more than buying it in Korea, but does the full expense go directly to the musicians and/or their labels? How much do the third parties (deliveries, foreign streaming sites, etc.) take from these costs? And which one is more \"reliable\" - a foreign market which has plenty of other artists to listen to, is prone to political incidents (eg. THAAD, religious disputes, war, etc.), and can run into other factors that can disrupt the promotion, or a domestic market that's readily available and offers more immediate support?\n\nThe riskiest part of touring is that it can't ensure that the artists' international popularity will last. Even if the venues sell out, the actual profit can be canceled out depending on the cost of transportation, renting the venue, paying the numerous staff, working out licensing issues (for performing certain songs), etc. Many mid- to small-tier labels have actually gone bankrupt and had their groups fizzle out due to the accrued debt from extensive touring, and in the worst-case scenarios, they may have only had a couple small-sized gigs in Japan or some other foreign country without even holding a proper promotion targeting Korean listeners.\n\nNot everything can be boiled down to \"entitled parasocial weirdos\" if you look closely behind the scenes.\n\nETA: I see that you are from Africa. Do you know the story of Sixto Rodriguez, whose story was covered in the documentary *Searching For The Sugar Man*? Despite his songs gaining significant airplay in Australia, New Zealand, Bostwana, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, and even boosting anti-apartheid cultures in South Africa, Rodriguez himself had quit recording music in 1976 due to his albums selling only a handful of copies and had been working in low-income jobs in his home country of America. Turns out he wasn't even aware of his sudden \"fame\" in the other countries until 1997, when his daughter found a website dedicated to him.",

While I do think parasocial relationships definitely play a part in the answer, this is definitely the kind of context I was curious about.

It's understandable that it wouldn't sit well with some fans. Thanks! \n\nETA: also I forgot to add that I'm actually not familiar with Sixto Rodriguez, something to look into.",

Another common pattern you can see with these companies is that once their artists have a breakthrough and the label has profited from it, they decide to move to a new building for better accommodation... which often backfires when their *next* comeback doesn't prove to be as successful.\n\nHere's an example involving one of my most favorite musicians, whom I have supported since 2007. Her position is somewhat similar to IU (soloist, not really the stereotypical \"pop idol\" type, is a household name but not as many peole identify as her \"fans\") but her fame came slightly earlier, then fell off the public's radar after a lawsuit and a label change. She released 7 albums, 5 EPs, and a load of digital singles throughout her 15+ years of career in Korea (more if you count her fame in Japan). Last year,  she had her first no.1 in more than a decade when her 6th repackage album became a sleeper hit, and the label responded by moving to a bigger office, accepting the 7th membership for her official fanclub at a more expensive price, and arranging the respective fanmeet at a venue that can hold up to two thousand people... when an estimated *seven* thousand people purchased the membership. The fanmeets for two other mid-tier groups under the same label will be holding their fanmeets at the same venue. The venue could be big enough for their fandoms, but it's too tiny to accommodate the sudden influx of my bias's new fans. What's worse is, the price of the tickets also increased by 1.5 times!",

And their label has been put under fire for their staff's unprofessional response (laughing and asking if they still had fans when they \"disbanded\" - they haven't) when a K-fan asked when their lightsticks will be back in stock. The last member in the military will be discharged this autumn, so we're hoping for the members' current individual labels to work out on their contracts and schedules so that they can plan another group comeback.\n\nLike, I get why foreign fans feel like they're left out, but there are times where even *Korean* fans get thrown under the rug - not just about local tours, but also about other basic necessities - and when we genuinely speak up about it, the i-fans miss our point and patronize us for being \"selfish\".",

Maybe they are also jealous bec the groups I follow (exo, all nct units) seems to always have so much fun (in concert/free time) in a different country than in SoKor. \n\nOne example for EXO, the fanmeet they did in Seoul was boring asf (day 2 was broadcasted) The crowd was dead (cant even sing a song from a recent album) and they made the members do boring activities. Comparing it to the one in Japan, they did fun games, had more interesting games and overall fan interaction. \n\nFor NCT, the concerts are much alive, the crowd is crazier which makes the members be crazier too. Its also on foreign soil we can see fun travel vlogs etc. \n\nSome k-fans still look down on international fans and think we bring nothing to the table.",

They try hard to make it seem like they aren't excited to go meet fans abroad.\n\nI'm also a Nctzen and 127 did the same thing. On their tours last year they kept trying to placate the Korean Nctzens with posts saying they'll miss them so much and they'll be \"right back\" and they'd just be gone for a 'little trip\" before they left. I mean it was painfully obvious what they were doing. But they did not make any posts or say how they were excited to see international fans....etc\n\nAnd then on Bubbl they kept explicitly talking to the K-fans saying they miss them etc and in turn International fans started to feel slighted because they are touring the States but acting like they weren't, weren't responding to Bubbls from American fans..etc Doyoung specifically kept saying things like he was \"bored\" and he was \"ready to go back to Korea\"   tons of International fans got upset because what? The Korean fans were responding with stuff like \"we'll come rescue you\" etc  \n\nYet when they released their travel vlogs from places like NYC and Cali, they'd had an absolute blast lmao \n\nA USA fan ran into Mark and Taeyong, got a pic with them and posted it on twit. K-fans flooded the post with mean comments saying \"it's unfair\" , \"get away from them\" etc and they don't get to take pics with them and all this stuff like that. After that when people ran into 127  members they started telling people they can't take photos.\n\nSome fansites followed them on their USA tour leg and openly admitted that the USA fans were A LOT of fun, the energy in the crowds was amazing and how happy the members looked on stage. And it's true because they were VERY happy to come here and get that energy they don't receive in SK. Even though they acted otherwise. \n\nSo idk when Taeyong expressed his irritation with it but I'm glad he finally said something and I'm guessing it was a build up from everything that happened last year and early this year with their tour. Because a lot of k-fans were being really harsh with them. \n\nI'm not saying ALL K-Fans are like this but it's obviously something of an issue if the idols speak on it, expressing annoyance or having to act like they aren't excited to go abroad. I do understand they make so much money from K-Fans but I do feel its sad that some of them feel like they are entitled to them or own them.\n\nAnd International fans have so few opportunities to see idols.",

Most concerts are limited to Seoul (and Busan at best). This means the fans who live outside the big cities are not as \"privileged\" regarding their chances to see their favs, either. One of my real-life friends lived in Daegu, and I lost count of the countless times she had to reschedule her personal meetings, save up for bus or train tickets, find a taxi to take her home when the Daegu public transportation stopped running, or even reserve a room for one night (if she was going to both days of our fav's weekend concerts). In contrast, I live in a part of Seoul that is very close to one of the most popular concert venues, and I have never missed the subway home since I've lived here.\n\nThat friend had it hard, but I can't imagine the discomfort of the fans living in Jeju who need to *fly* to come all the way to Seoul. I've met one fan who once took the entire day off because they were accepted to a fansign, only for it to get canceled at the last moment. They had to spend the whole day wandering around a part of town they weren't interested in because they couldn't cancel their guesthouse reservation in time, and they had no friends in Seoul. So no, not all of us are the lucky ones who have an automatic pass that will whisk ourselves to the venues.",

My bias group is a boy group whose label is considered mid-tier compared to SM, JYP, etc. and they held a tour in Busan in 2014. Another bias is a female soloist, and she went on a tour in Gwangju, Daegu, and Busan only 4 months ago. In contrast, I've seen girl groups with even bigger fanbases (both Korean and international) and better recognition, like Twice or Blackpink, who successfully went on global tours all around the world and held concert some of the biggest concert halls in Korea, but have yet to hold a concert *outside* Seoul.\n2. IMO the \"hardcore fan level\" can't be an exact gauge. It's true that girl groups tend to have more public recognition and attract a bigger pool of fans/listeners, but there are more boy groups that sold out bigger venues. Among all the musicians who performed in KSPO Dome (the biggest venue in Olympic Park, holds up to 15,000 people max., even NKOTB held their Korean concert here in 1992 - although it got canceled after a crowd crush incident), 23 were boy groups (H.O.T were the first, Monsta X was the most recent), 8 were girl groups, 10 were male soloists, and 5 were female soloists.\n3. It's not \"traveling a bit\" when we suffer from [a huge imbalance of long-distance transportation facilities between the metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions](https://twitter.com/LEUMENG/status/1665372599734468611?s=19). If the train from Seoul to Busan takes a minimum of 2 hours and 15 minutes, someone living in Busan [should not have to take a 4-hour train ride to go to Gwangju](https://twitter.com/BONAMANABANANA/status/1665574622379626497?s=19), which is *closer* to Busan than Seoul is. Note that there are no buses that run between those cities, even when both are in the top 10 biggest and most populated cities of Korea. Plus, i-fans always seem to miss out on Jeju, where you need to take a plane to go to the \"mainland\".",

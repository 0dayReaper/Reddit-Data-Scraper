There's an idol who gives strong neurodivergent vibes to me, but I don't feel great about publicly speculating, particularly since I'm not on the spectrum. They have talked about some social anxiety like having trouble with eye contact, being anxious in crowds, and preferring to wear headphones to deal with it sometimes, but nothing specifically about being on the spectrum. They're very loved and supported by their group members though, so I think that helps with the aspects of idol life they've mentioned struggling with. Like, they often ask their group members what they are or aren't allowed to say because I get the feeling social cues can be tough for them. But the vibes are always good when it happens on lives or something, they just have a little conference with the other members and everyone is having a good time. I mean, I would kind of like a group of friends to run things past whenever I want too, not going to lie",

He was so stressed over how famous they'd become. When he tells these stories, he's always calm and cool about it and often laughs at his past behavior to ease the story but you call that he and the members were really upset at the time. A lot of stories and info is kept private and this is what he shared.

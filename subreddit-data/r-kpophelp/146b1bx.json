It says it\u2019s a private community only members can access but I was definitely a member. Idk if this is related to the blackout but I thought that starts on the 12th",

The AMA was clearly meant as a pacifier with pre written responses Spez copied + pasted from a prepared document, they weren\u2019t interested in hearing anything from the people. So if kpopthoughts doesn\u2019t budge on \u201cindefinitely\u201d, it really be that way.",

The only thing I could possibly see happening is maybe lowering the prices to look like \"the good guy\" while likely still leaving them out of reach of the vast majority of third party devs so its still the same effective outcome.\n\ni don't know whether any of the subs aiming for \"indefinitely\" have a specific threshold of response from reddit that they are expecting to get them to reopen, but I guess we'll find out.",

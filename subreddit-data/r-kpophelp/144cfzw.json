    "postText": "how do yall pronounce hybe??\nive been saying it like like hive with a b sound instead of v so ig like \u201chyBe\u201d. \n\nanyways i had a shower thought that b and v are pronounced the same in korean so would it be pronounced as \u201chive\u201d but spelt as hybe since yk some names switch the i and y to make it fancy ig lol. \n\nngl i do think it\u2019s supposed to be \u201chyBe\u201d but they could\u2019ve made a \u201cbees in the hive\u201d concept. i\u2019ve only watched the name change announcement vid once when it first came out so idk.",

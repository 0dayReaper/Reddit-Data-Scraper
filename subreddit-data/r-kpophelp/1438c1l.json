She managed to have a million votes, and that's way back in 2004. I suggest you'd watch the documentary about her during her time in the Philippines. She's still known in the Philippines even to does who knows nothing about K-Pop (she and Ryan Bang are the only Koreans my grandparents knows), and she's still called as \"Sandy\" by them.\n\nShe also never tried to cut her ties in the Philippines. She loved the Philippines dearly, so the Filipinos loved her dearly in return. She constantly promotes the Philippines, calls the Philippines as her second home, still fluently speaks the Filipino language, always goes here for a vacation, fully embraces the Filipino culture, etc. Filipinos are even saying that she should have the *Global Ambassador Award* given to Vanessa Hudgens.\n\nHer personality is also a good reason. She's known for being kind, specially to her fans. Since you have seen the videos, you might have already seen how she always tries to give autographs and takes pictures with them.",

She'll always be our Krung Krung lol",

She had quite a career before joining YG and 2ne1 had an instant following here in the Philippines because many of her fans became de facto 2ne1 fans. She also featured the Philippines quite regularly in her Vlog and called it \"Dara Tour\". When she's here (and she's regularly here), she eats in well-known Filipino restaurants that she has been patronizing since she was still a local star. She even took Big Bang to one of them during their last concert stop in the country.",

Nick is half-Thai and Dara is referring to her practically growing up in the Philippines. She still speaks the language. Her English has a Tagalog accent lol. She once shifted her accent to reflect a Filipino accent when saying the word \"automatic\". \n\nWhen she started her career in the Philippines, it was the height of the C-drama popularity. She was hot stuff because she looked the part AND spoke the language. She acknowledges her Filipino \"roots\" no matter where she goes.",

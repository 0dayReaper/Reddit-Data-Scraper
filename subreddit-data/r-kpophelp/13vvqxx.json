    "postText": "I got into an argument with my sister, so I'm just curious if anyone else has had a big impact by any idol(s). For me, it's seventeen.\n\nSee, Seventeen means the absolute world to me. It's not like I'd worship the ground they walk on or anything, but I look up to them a lot. It's not because of the way they look, or something stupid like that. It's because of them; their music, their message, their personalities, their love.\n\nWhen I first started stanning them, my mental health and situation was awful. I didn't have a future, I barely had a present. The impact that those boys have had on me is bigger and more precious than I could ever even explain. Sometimes I wonder just where I'd be if I didn't have them, if I'd even be alive. It's everything they stand for and everything they give and show to carats. It's not like I started stanning them and magically got healed, no. They helped me find the strength and self love I needed to save myself. They showed me that it's okay to fuck up, and that its okay to feel defeated and to change your goals; it's okay to give up. Life is hard but it's worth living. When things knock you down, you climb back to your feet and keep going. They showed me that. \n\nThey showed me that I *deserve* to live. That I deserve to have the future I've dreamt of since I was a little kid. They showed me that the only thing holding me back was myself. If I hadn't found them, I don't think I ever would've found that strength, that determination. It's because of them that I got myself help, that I got my GED and that I'm in college pursuing my dream. God, before them, I was convinced I was stupid and a piece of shit, destined to go nowhere. Now I'm studying to get my PHD. I never even thought that was possible before them.\n\nI never would've believed any of that before. I was always taught that even a small mistake, a tiny fuck up, makes you a complete and total failure. I got knocked down early in life and I never stood back up until them. I was Sisyphus, but that rock was just crushing me. I couldn't even get a foot ahead. Even when I made small progress, it would slide back down so fast that you wouldn't even notice. But since I found them? I'm not like that anymore. I'm still pushing a huge rock up a steep hill, but it's not cursed to fall down anymore. I'm making progress in life that seemed impossible. Now, even when that rock slides back which normally would destroy me, I'm able to find my footing and keep pushing it. They're the reason I found that in myself to do it. \n\nI'm just wondering if anyone else has had a positive impact by any idols. Who was it &amp; how did it effect you? :)",

            "comment": "Not a group, but Younha became my biggest role model after I first saw her on a 2006 documentary show revolving around her initial success in Japan. (She defied her mother's disapproval, dropped out of high school, flew to Japan without even knowing a lick of Japanese, and managed to release a handful of singles and one fofficial album there before returning to Korea about 2-3 years later.) I had already lived abroad and picked up English at a near-native level, but she got me interested in learning other languages and I almost learned Japanese solely because of her - my family went to Hong Kong though, and I ended up picking up Mandarin instead. I envied her bravery to relocate in a completely new environment, her voice, her piano skills, and the love and support she received from everyone. I collected all her CDs, listened to her songs on my MP3 player back when I didn't have a smartphone, and even applied to her alma mater, which has one of the best language programs in Korea. And I got accepted. She's influenced my own life experiences as well as my current job in translation.\n\nYounha was that artist who everyone knew, but not many people who identified as her avid fan, which made my position as a fan and listener rather ambiguous. No matter how much I told other people that I was her fan, they would brush it off saying that they \"liked her music, too\", find it weird that a girl was a fan of a female soloist who wasn't even a dance pop artist, or joke that it was a miracle that a two-hit wonder like her (she hit a slump after suing her former label and her post-\"liberation\" songs didn't chart as well) still had fans. Well, nearly fifteen years later, her signature songs got a resurgence after a few episodes of *Hangout With Yoo* and \"Event Horizon\" became a sleeper hit that swept the charts. The joke is on them now, since *they* missed out a lot on her amazing career!\n\nFor boy groups, Block B broadened my playlist because I first knew of Zico and Kyung (or more like Nacseo and Holke) when they were uploading freestyles, and I was just getting into the world of hip hop. That coupled with my rediscovery of one particular music video from my childhood (FYI it was \"Try Again\" by Aaliyah), I started delving into hip hop and R&amp;B and never turned back. Now my playlist is full of legendary musicians like Brandy, TLC, Missy, Timbaland, LL Cool J, etc. Block B's ups and downs in career also made the artist-fan bond a lot stronger, and I've appreciated how they (and Younha alike) persevered and reaped what they sowed.",

I know that Y Si Fuera Ella techinally isnt *his* song, and I have no idea why, but it always brings me such comfort. Just hearing his voice, perhaps. \n\nYou know, I've never really cared for my birthday. Jonghyun and I have the same one (different years by quite a few, but same day and month). After I got into Shinee &amp; got so attached to Jonghyun, I started celebrating it every year. Not even really for me, but for him as well. \n\nI miss him everyday, I'm sure all Shawols do, but I just know that it would mean so much to him to know how much you look up to him &lt;3",

I love how he doesn\u2019t pretend to be anyone but himself, he\u2019s loud when he wants to be loud and he\u2019s quiet when he wants to be quiet. people judged him for his RBF and I related a lot as someone who can seem distant and unfeeling at first. he\u2019s talked about how he doesn\u2019t like when people project onto him, and he\u2019s very straightforward about setting boundaries (whether people bother to listen to him is another story lol). he\u2019s always been an out of the box kind of guy and it made me feel less afraid to be myself unapologetically. plus his solo work on soundcloud threw me directly into the BTS rabbithole and that in itself has changed my life quite a bit",

I don't want to repeat what she said since some of it was racially charged but she was just adamant that pop singers, idols in particular, can't have any personal impact on people &amp; that they aren't role models- \"especially if they don't speak english\" lol",

My life got a lot better in 2019, and I didn\u2019t give up, but when COVID happened I felt very lonely and several bad things happened back to back to back, and I was terrified that I would find myself back in the really awful mindset I was in 2019\u2014 I had worked so hard to create a life I wanted to live, and it felt like covid/lockdown were trying to take it all away from me. My best friend (also a very big influence on my willingness to stay around) showed me kick it and I immediately was obsessed haha. But more than his looks or his voice or his ability as a dancer, which are all incredible, was his thought processes, the way he speaks and the way he writes his lyrics. If you listen to his SoundCloud music, a lot of it addresses loneliness and other really rough topics, but he does so in a very hopeful way. I just genuinely believe that he\u2019s a very beautiful human being with a very kind soul, and I\u2019m very lucky to have found him. He\u2019s releasing his first official solo album[SHALALA](https://youtu.be/GnfQ2_lHuqk) June 5th, and from the previews alone, I can already tell it\u2019s going to make me a sobbing mess, but like, in a good way.",

            "comment": "Yoongi (BTS) straight up saved my life. I'm too tired to write a long text right now, but I know many others feel the same way and will probably comment about him too.\n\nTo make it short: I found BTS (or they found me) in 2018 when I was in a really dark place. I was very suicidal towards the second half of the year, but I bought BTS concert tickets and promised myself to keep going until the concert, to give life and myself another chance. \nThe concert changed everything, it gave me back my will to live, it gave me hope, I met so many amazing and friendly Armys who welcomed me like family (this is also why I will never understand people who say Army is the most toxic fandom. Everyone I met was soo sweet. I get that we have toxic fans too, but so does every fandom). That evening BTS and Armys gave me the feeling that I was loved, that they are proud of me and believe in me.\n\nEspecially Yoongi's lyrics helped me through it all and made me feel understood. As a musician, I was very inspired by him and his musical hard work. \nI could relate to his childhood and youth (unsupportive parents, some struggles with poverty, mental health issues, love for music), and him overcoming his hardships and achieving success after all the work he did gave me hope that I could make it out of my situation too.\n\nI especially admire that he followed his passion for music. I'm currently studying something at university, that is not music related, since I was too afraid to never make it out of poverty to only pursue music. It is such a competitive field and won't give you a secure job if you're not one of the bests, so I respect him deeply for taking that risk and not giving up. Because of him I'm not giving up on music yet, still making music in my free time, and I'll not give up hope that some day I'll be able to make it a bigger part of my life too.\n\nI'm also too tired to read over this to correct mistakes, so I'm sorry if my English is incorrect or weird in some parts.",

I've always loved writing, but I knew I could never make a career out of it. I've thougbt about giving it up several times, but I always kept going. It's a hobby of mine that I absolutely adore, despite that it'll never actually come to anything. I hope you can do the same!! Maybe even make a career eventually! I'm cheering you on!!\n\nAbout the army thing, I definitely see both sides as it. I'm a former-army myself, and I've had a lot of friends who are former armys as well. For me personally, it was because I just didn't really connect to them anymore &amp; I wasn't enjoying their music as much, but for some of my friends it was because of the fandom. I still listen to some of their older music, and I still actively listen to anything Jhope releases (he was my bias when I stanned them and I still love him with my entire heart. I think he'll always have a special place because he was my first ever bias &lt;3). It's sorta a catch-22 imo, because there's always a portion of fandoms that are crazy &amp; toxic, BTS in particulars just has loads because of the sheer size of it. That side of some fandoms is also a LOT louder than others and I feel like that's the case for BTS. \nI'm a blink too, and 99% of the people I've met are the nicest! They're always so happy to support the girls and to talk to other blinks. And yet, there's a huge group of blinks/akgaes that are very loud and very, very toxic. I've seen people leave the blink fandom because of them too. I definitely think it can affect the way you view a group because of how that toxicity can weigh on your soul, yk? And when that small portion, whether it be armys, blinks, or some other fandom, attack people, outside and inside the fandom, over really small things, and it happens to you personally, I can definitely see why it'd make you dislike the group/fandom and start viewing it as only toxic.\nPart of the reason, I think, that people generalize fandoms like armys or blinks, is because of how loud and seemingly endless that portion of it is. If you don't actively join the fandom yourself, it's hard to see the people that aren't, well, crazy. And that sucks because the idea of a whole fandom being toxic can stop new people from getting into the group, yk? As much as it sucks, unfortunately the fandom does define how the artist is viewed and when a small portion is the loudest, it negatively affects the viewpoint of non-fans :(\n\nAlso, don't worry about the English thing!! It was perfect! I apologize if my stuff is formatted weirdly or flows weird because I'm half asleep myself lolol",

When there are millions of people in the fandom, even a small portion of it is still going to be extremely large. Blinks and Armys are the best example of this currently, but I think Stays and Engenes are coming up pretty quick lol. The disappointing part imo is that as fandoms get older, their loudness/toxicity tends to go down from what I've seen (such as Sones and EXOls, both are pretty old atp so they're a lot more quite in my experience) but with BTS and BLACKPINK going insanely popular in the USA and just worldwide, it makes it harder to get to that point, if ever. \n\nIt also sucks because as new groups debut and get big, fandoms of really popular groups get threatened (the toxic ones, I mean, not the other ones!) and start doing nasty shit to the new ones. The treatment 5050 is getting from armchairs and blonks is just so depressing :( I've seen several armys and blinks congratulating them and cheering them on, but they get drowned out by all the loud ones. \n\nIt's really difficult imo to get into a fandom that's known for being toxic. Truthfully, if I hadn't become a blink or army before everything, I probably wouldn't have ever gotten into them. My mental health just can't handle the toxic stuff, but being already part of it makes it really easy to find the sane, quiet ones and just stay there. People just getting into don't have that option as easily it seems to me. Hopefully, one day, the loud ones will just shut up and make way for the actual fans that just genuinely love their idols to take front but I doubt it ever will \ud83e\udd72",

[he was in fact initially selected for a really good geology school but he gave that up to go to an arts school for music](https://twitter.com/julyhours/status/1653634517637136388?s=46). his comment \u201cif you do something you dislike everyday, then how different are you from being a living corpse?\u201d still gives me chills and encourages me to try harder to achieve my dream\n\nbesides both of them, the other members are really cool too. the notables ones for me are jiwoong- who is, at this point, almost openly pro lgbt and doesn\u2019t shy away from showing it- and taerae- who is known to be really crazy about his passion, which is singing. zb1 has inspired me a lot to get back up again even if i\u2019m sick and tired of everything around me. they also encourage me to work hard and be myself. these were two lessons i really needed right now. i have a long way to go and i\u2019m so thankful to zb1 for teaching me that",

            "comment": "also i have to add yuta here too! i\u2019ve been stanning nct since 2018 and yuta has consistently been my ult bias in kpop since then. i remember in 2018 nct weren\u2019t as famous as they are now (at least for an sm group). this particularly impacted less famous members like yuta. idk if anyone would remember this but in certain videos, yuta visibly used to look upset or sad. but i\u2019ve seen him grow from the incredibly low focus sm gave him to become one of the most popular and known kpop idols in japan. he also has such a dedicated fanbase now that it makes me really happy. it feels like i grew up with yuta\u2019s growth so i feel very personally attached to him- and even to nct as a whole!",

I love how genuine the members are and their bond is beautiful. Watching their videos and listening to their music makes me happy and uplifted and helps me get through the day.",

I started listening to all their feel-good inspiring songs and it made me want to keep going. Now, 3 years later, I'm in a better space thanks to their music. With them, I always feel like I have a friend to turn to when times are difficult",

            "comment": "ateez and a.c.e specifically, i found a.c.e during my first of college when covid hit and it was so comforting knowing i could turn to them when i just wanted some good music, or some silly videos to watch as a distraction from the outside world. watching their dedication to their craft, starting out from a tiny basement and busking, wearing hot pants and going on survival shows just to attempt to get their name out there, they\u2019ve worked insanely hard. ik they\u2019re not millions of fans big but they\u2019re such a special group to me, and ik i can always turn to them whenever i need anything,,\n\nateez in general also are such an inspiration, but hongjoong specifically really stands out to me. not just in his music, but with his activism too and knowing he just wants what\u2019s right; like super recently when i believe he said atiny would be allowed to film at the jp concerts and even regretting not allowing it sooner. i\u2019ve also met some of my closest friends because of ateez and i truly would not change a thing.",

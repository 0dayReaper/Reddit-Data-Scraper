    "postText": "I just noticed that there are many idols that have filmed tiktoks with idols from different companies inside of their companies building (if that makes sense). For example, BM from KARD filmed with Jisun from Fromis_9 inside the HYBE building. It was really random seeing that because I never imagined KARD inside of the HYBE building. I\u2019ve seen many tiktoks like these now where i\u2019m wondering why these idols are inside of different companies. Is it because they are invited? Is it because they have business with that company? It feels like a disney cross over episode hahah \ud83d\ude05 Can someone explain?",

I guess it's just like visiting your friend's workplace. The higher I go up my current corporate ladder, the more I see people go visiting their friend's offices.",

            "comment": "For work and for collabs. Sometimes idols will practice in the practice rooms of other companies especially if there\u2019s a collab stage or the group\u2019s choreo was choreographed by someone who works for another company. That\u2019s how ab6ix ended up [filming their choreo dance practice in the YGX building](https://youtu.be/6OZbu0RoMwc) because their Loser choreo was choreographed by a YGX dancer.\n\nThere was a point Somi was looking for friends to do tiktok challenges with, so that\u2019s why she visited the BNM building to do a [tiktok challenge with Daehwi &amp; Woojin.](https://youtube.com/shorts/z2PFFSXdSDo?feature=share)\n\nWoojin also visited VIVIZ\u2019s company once to not only exchange tiktok challenges [with his friend SinB](https://youtube.com/shorts/iOACtm5OV-k?feature=share) but also to let VIVIZ members do a [first listen](https://youtu.be/Y66jZiZYmmo) for his solo album title track. \n\nIn general though yeah, they do have to be invited (otherwise how you gonna get past security lol), but it\u2019s probably more like getting invited to the office space of your industry buddy, and doesn\u2019t require a whole lot of notice to the company. Most companies probably don\u2019t even know/care who idols invite over as long as the visit is productive. Some of these company buildings are pretty close to each other too. AB6IX\u2019s company building (BNM) is only like a block away from ASTRO\u2019s company building (Fantagio) so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they have even allowed each other to rent practice room time from each other.",

If you are friends with an idol at X company you can visit them. Most groups now promote their song on Tiktok by doing a video with their friends or at music shows (ex: Golden Child\u2019s Tag went to HYBE and did videos with Yeonjun).",

                            "comment": "If it only happened once or twice for a promotion cycle I'd say it would be more likely that they were there on other business, but because it's basically become the norm for idols to do tiktok challenge collabs and many do 10+ challenge videos, it's probably much more likely to be planned. Some groups might go to greater lengths to find collabs while others just film with whoever is free backstage at music shows.\n\nKard in particular seems to be making a point to do their tiktok challenge with everyone they can think of (they caption their challenges with \"&lt;guest&gt; and everybody #ICKY\"). From a quick count on their instagram they are at nearly 30 clips of them doing the challenge with other idols (this is not including the ones where it's just the members on their own).\n\nAt the end of the day it's a promotion tactic because the fans find it fun and it gets more people to check out the song who might not otherwise listen to the group but chose to watch the tiktok anyway because their faves are in it.\n\nedit: autocorrect typo",

Some companies rent out rehearsal and recording studios. Song writing workshops often include people from different lables and freelancers. It's quite normal to have people not related to the company in their building every day.",

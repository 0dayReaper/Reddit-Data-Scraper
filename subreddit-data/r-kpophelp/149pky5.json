    "postText": "Filo ONCEs, you\u2019re probably already aware that the preselling of tickets is near. I\u2019m currently torn between spending a ticket or spending it on a vacation. My budget is currently tight. I was thinking what are the chances that I can look for a seller who would like to sell his/her ticket sometime later probably around July or August. I haven\u2019t been to a concert yet so I don\u2019t know how this would work out. Also, where can I look for potential sellers? What socmed platform?",

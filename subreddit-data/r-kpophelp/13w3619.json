    "postText": "Hi! The reason I am making this post is because I need help describing why Jaeyun's voice, from new rookie boy group 8turn, is so unique. I have no formal knowledge in singing or vocals so I was hoping someone could help explain why his tone seems so different compared to other male idols and provide some technical explanation about it because it's been driving me crazy not being able to describe why it's so unique.\n\nHere are some performances of him showcasing his tone: there is this [one](https://youtu.be/8BM6k8hZ3z4?t=108) (timestamped to where he sings) where his group cover's 4Minute's Crazy which I fully recommend watching, here are his two prominent lines ([1](https://youtu.be/XqpKQsc6E0w?t=146), [2](https://youtu.be/XqpKQsc6E0w?t=27)) in their debut song Tic Tac, and [here](https://youtu.be/mmjjr2np7KI?t=313) is him singing a short snippet of New Jean's Cookie.\n\nIf I had to describe his voice it's full, like it does sound deep but it's not only deep but super rich. Most people, whenever they react to 8turn's music or performances, point out his singing. It also doesn't sound like he's forcing his voice to go so wide and deep and that it's natural, so I was wondering if maybe he has a natural vocal range outside of the norm for male idols. It's almost like his voice is naturally pitched down like those audios for Anime MVs or Tik Toks. I swear I haven't heard a kpop singer like him in awhile and that most male idols sound more airy (?) and light. If anyone could help explain why please do!",

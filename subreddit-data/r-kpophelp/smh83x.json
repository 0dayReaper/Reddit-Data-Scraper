    "postText": "Idk if this sub allows meta posts but here we go. \n\nI noticed the sudden rise of these posts the past few days and I just have to say, if Twitter stans (usually) don't acknowledge those Twitter accounts with few and far between tweets that suddenly come out with stories about idols that are seemingly unfounded, I think we should take these new AMAs with a grain of salt. \n\nNone of the posters have shown proof of actually working with said idols (I'm not asking them to doxx their life, but maybe a backstage pass with a name redacted is a good starting point) but somehow have all of this insider knowledge. At best, they're basically those anonymous accounts that comment on pannchoa or instiz posts for the sake of quick karma/clout. \n\nIf you take a further step back, some of those posters come in with very *inherently* seen biases with how quickly they're willing to praise some groups and yet throw others under the bus, even when not asked about said groups. \n\nI think this is another case of someone potentially wanting anonymous internet karma as well as having a platform to either slander or praise a particular group, while coming off as \"genuine\". Those posters really have nothing to lose but fake internet points and an agenda to push as gain.",

Why would they go this far to prank a (presumably) random staff member like that \ud83d\udc80 I guess they can be fun stories though, as long as you take them with a grain of salt",

            "comment": "random, but a few months ago, there was a post where someone claiming to korean said they would give their perspective on groups as a korean. the post became super hot and while the responses were interesting, i wouldnt say there was anything said that couldnt be found out by engaging with kpop fan spaces (ie: which groups are more popular internationally vs domestically, who is popular in korea, etc).\n\nmy nosey ass ofc decided to check their post history bc i was curious and wanted to see if they maybe had some further interesting posts about korea....however, nothing in their post history indicated that they lived in korea at all. now that could just be because they didnt feel the need to post in such topics, but i went all the way back in their history (yes im a creep) and not only was their a 6\\~ year gap between their first posts and their most recent posts (the ones on r/kpophelp), it sounded like their speech pattern changed. like their post in r/kpophelp sounded like a non english speaker who had english very well, but still came off a bit jilted at time, while their first posts read like a native english speaker who could communicate casually quite easily.\n\nnow, maybe i was wrong, but i did see the post again recently and noted that the OP had deleted their account. so there's that.\n\nanyways, just used that as an example to say, while these sort of posts are always fun, they should mostly be taken as just that: fun. a lot of them cant be used for any sort of legitimacy.",

How are these any different to those many insider accounts that we see on twitter all the time. And I absolutely avoid those type of accounts and yet there are so many naive fans that actually fall for it and believe in them. \n\nI get that fans are curious and would like to have some insights about their faves on what they are like behind the scenes but don't seriously believe everything that you read especially when it comes from an anonymous source who can easily make up info just to get some karma and clout. Best to take it with a grain of salt.\n\nEdit: Rephrased sentence. Added a sentence at the end.",

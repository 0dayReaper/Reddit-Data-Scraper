    "postText": "I've always found it fascinating how TWICE became so popular outside of Asia when they were never intended for the western market. JYP's focus with TWICE has clearly always been on Asia, but even\r  \n somehow they ended up conquering a huge western audience I would like to ask: do you have any idea why TWICE managed to become so popular outside Asia, even if initially it was not JYP's focus with the group, and even without a English speaking member?",

The internet helps remove a lot of barriers of access and watching MVs and digital streaming makes it easy for things to go viral. i.e. Gangnam Style\n\nKCon probably helped? Barely a year after debut and they performed in the U.S.\n\nI also feel they somewhat filled the void of SNSD no longer being active, therefore the spot of \"nations girl group\" sort of opened up, more members means more opportunities for fans to find themselves intrigued if there a wide variety of personalities/looks",

            "comment": "i guess it just happened very organically, they became a household for kpop and so just as kpop fans and enthusiastics learned more abt the genre they eventually learned abt the group and become attracted to it i guess. Also there was this huge kpop boost, especially in america around 2018 and even bigger in 2020 due to the pandemic so moments like these def helped. Honestly as someone whos been around since their debut im extremely happy for them, they truly deserve it.",

Mainly from fancy it started but personally I think twice could've been way popular earlier especially after likey's international success but that time jype didn't have financial stability to promote them so all twice gained was slowly but organically",

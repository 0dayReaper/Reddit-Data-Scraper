            "comment": "for ateez I\u2019m pretty sure the 2.0 cards are fan sign cards! so for example, [everline 1.0](https://twitter.com/everlineshop/status/1662368355473567744?s=46&amp;t=E8G36wSGaDNMjSzNo6bRzw) is the pre order benefit card, so the card is a gift for pre ordering. whereas [everline 2.0](https://twitter.com/everlineshop/status/1664829258206683138?s=46&amp;t=E8G36wSGaDNMjSzNo6bRzw) is a fan sign event, so the benefit card is a gift for applying to the fan sign, if that makes sense? \n\nbut the difference between 1.0 and 2.0 is basically just that the photo on the benefit card is different haha, and that the name of the \u201cspecial event\u201d tends to change from pre order to fan sign :)",

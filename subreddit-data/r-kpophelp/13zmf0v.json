I don't remember the song but I remember what the video looked like:\n- video starts with a girl held captive by bad guys\n-all the members are in warehouse with junk and cars\n-one of the members bashes in a window with I think a baseball bat\n-theres this one clip of one of them singing through a fence and it's dark\n-theres clips of them hanging out with the girl when she wasn't held captive and she was happy\n-video ends with them all at the rooftop fighting the bad guys\n\nI'm pretty positive it's BTS but any other suggestions would be appreciated :)",

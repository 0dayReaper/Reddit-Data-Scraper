Came back this morning, and it's set to private?!?!\n\nWhat's the likelihood that this will be permanent and can anyone recommend another good reddit where you can talk about whatever's on your mind for Kpop?\n\nEdit:\nThere's a black out going on!\n\nLook into it\n\nhttps://medium.com/tech-lead-hub/the-reddit-blackout-a-deep-dive-into-the-incident-164317d010b8",

            "comment": "Just a bit more information:\n\nDifferent subreddits may participate in this blackout in slightly different ways. For example, the main Kpop subs (/r/kpop, /r/kpophelp, /r/kpoppers) are planning to go private for 48 hours only, from June 12-14. Others are extending it indefinitely until they see an acceptable response from Reddit. Among these, some like /r/kpopthoughts have decided to begin the blackout early. Still others are keeping the subs open (e.g. for information/archival purposes) but not allowing any new posts during the blackout.\n\nRegarding whether it will be permanent: Reddit has pretty much doubled down on its API policy changes in the last few days. So if the subs that go private indefinitely honor their commitment to wait for an acceptable resolution, it seems increasingly likely that this will be permanent. This is unfortunate, but it's good to see them taking a stand for our community.",

I like to think of myself as informed, but the fact that I let something of this magnitude slip by me unnoticed makes me feel bad lol\n\nMass protest events like this can be POWERFUL, and while change can be hard to actually get implemented... It's amazing to see and makes me proud to be a kpopper. Are most people going to stop posting altogether on those days?",

That being said, the current situation seems to be quite severe, as communications between Reddit and 3rd party app developers, mods, etc. have pretty much broken down, and the community's trust in the Reddit team has degraded greatly. So I'm not as confident this protest will be successful, though I still fully support it. In terms of whether people will stop posting, I guess that depends on the sub - some of the largest ones (e.g. /r/AskReddit) haven't announced a blackout yet, but many others have.",

I was feeling disconnected and bitter, and didn't want to deal with the fakeness and facade that can sometimes come from social media.\n\nI am SO glad that I recently came back to Reddit. This kind of social media I can get behind, because you can find other like minded individuals with the same passion, and interests as yourself. KPop fans always blow me away with their intensity and commitment xD \n\nYou have a wealth of knowledge and it's always a treat to come across someone who takes the time to explain things!

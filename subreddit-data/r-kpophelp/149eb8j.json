    "postText": "The NCT Nation lives will be during the time I'm travelling to Japan and I want to go, but I'm not familiar with fanclub registration, concerts (this would be my first concert) or AnyPass. \nI saw some posts about how concerts in Japan work but had a couple questions:\n- For Japanese fanclub registration, do I need a Japanese phone number? Does it need to match the number in AnyPass? I have a tenso address, so I should be fine for that. \n- If I register, would they send me stuff? To the address or to the phone number provided?\n- Would they take foreign credit cards (US) for payment or do I need to pay at 7/11 in Japan?\n- If I don't get picked, is there another way I can get a ticket? Maybe it's better to wait for resale, since I saw a lot of Japanese fans are applying for multiple locations/days?\n- At the venue, what would be needed to get in? Just QR code on AnyPass and ID?\n\nIf anyone was successful in applying, I would really appreciate an explanation of the process you went through.\nThank you!",

            "comment": "My experience with Japanese events are not K-pop related. However, I've been to Japanese stage plays, voice actor events, conventions, and anisong concerts in Japan. I've used proxy services, friends and family, and even direct international selling to secure tickets to various events. Things have changed ever since the pandemic and historically, they haven't been friendly to foreign concert goers. \n\nI'll try to answer to the best of my knowledge and experience. I know it's not K-pop related but I hope it will give you a general idea of how it may work.\n\n1 and 2. I don't think the Tenso phone number will work for fan club/ticketing confirmation because I think every one who uses Tenso has that same number (and address). If ever you get to register and they'll send a fanclub packet, your tenso address will work as long as it matches the name you registered with on both services.\n\n3. It's worth a try to use your foreign credit card if they allow credit card payments. Be ready to check with you bank in case they flag it as suspicious. However, you may need to print your tickets at a 7/11 or other convenience store within DAYS after paying.\n\n4. I'm not sure if this concert will release single tickets after lottery. The concerts I've been to (Animelo Summer Live) don't but you can try to look for resellers who are willing to transfer their ticket to you digitally (if possible) or meet with you before the concert to exchange the actual physical ticket. \n\n5. You need your ticket to get in. It can be digitally via a QR code or an actual paper ticket. There are some concerts where they check your fan club membership but I think they don't do that much anymore. I know for the Idolmaster fandom, they (used to) do that. I've never been checked for that before.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry it's not K-pop but that's generally how JP ticketing and events *may* go. I'm sure there are more helpful videos out there from people who have experience with K-pop events in Japan but I hope this gives you at least a bit of an idea.",

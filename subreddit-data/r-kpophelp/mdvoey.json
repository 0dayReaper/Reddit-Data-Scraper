    "postText": "Very sensitive and serious topic incoming.\n\nSo I'm sure most of you have heard by now of Jackson and Team Wang's statement regarding ending their partnership with Adidas.\n\nIf not here's an article: [https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dp7ed/kpop-stars-jackson-wang-adidas-china-xinjiang-cotton](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dp7ed/kpop-stars-jackson-wang-adidas-china-xinjiang-cotton)\n\nJackson used to be my bias in GOT7 and I enjoyed listening to his solo music. He seemed like a really nice and charismatic guy. I had never heard of Jackson's association with the CCP until now because I never followed his activities very closely and I'm surprised I never found out about it before until now. When I read that statement, I was shocked and my heart felt gutted. I just recently got into GOT7 and  Jackson's music and was learning all about them too.\n\nWhether or not Jackson truly supports the CCP of his own volition it or is truly forced to do so, I'll never be able to know concretely. I don't know what Jackson's life is like or what goes on in his head day to day, but with this statement I just feel like I had to draw a line at some point, and I feel really disappointed in Jackson right now. I'm not sure if I'll be able to listen to music anymore, especially \"Bullet to the Heart\" since I loved that song.\n\nI just think back to his first solo song, \"Papillion\" where he says \"Money and fame Uh, don't define me\" and I just don't really know anymore.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks a lot for all the replies you guys have given; I made sure to read each and every comment and reply. I think it's provided a lot of good discussion about topics like these and it's given me a lot to think about and reflect on.",

I had the same issue with Lay from EXO, who was my favourite EXO member, but he is even more outspoken about his support for the CCP.\n\nIt's different for everyone I guess, but I can't really stomach supporting him any more after reading the reports of what is happening in those camps.",

If you\u2019re a history buff like myself than you will understand completely. \n\nSo just a few decades ago, maybe 6-7, there was another country that was also led by a dictator that was very reliant and supportive of the use of extream propaganda to push their agenda onto their people and very strongly used their power to influence and control the economy of their country in every way imaginable. \n\nAnyways, there were also rumors of atrocities being committed to the ethnic minorities of their country such as forced labor (slavery) and yes, ethnic cleansing that had occurred at remote locations in the country. But there was very little evidence to support all of the accusations and rumors. \n\nA very notable tactic they used was to completely blacklist any business and or person from the country if they were not apart of their party. \n\nAnd yes, I am referring to the Nazi party of Germany in the 1930\u2019s and 1940\u2019s. \n\nThey had blacklisted all of the companies of the country if they were not apart of the Nazi party and even actors and actresses from appearing in anything if they were opposed to the state ideology. \n\nFast forward to today, YES it is an equal comparison, YES there are VERY extream accusations of those exact atrocities happening in remote locations in China to an even higher degree, and the most important part is that **YES THEIR IS EVIDENCE OF EVERY SINGLE ACCUSATION THATBHAS BEEN MADE, there are countless photos, videos, satillite images, and escaped prisoners that have all been subjected to atrocities that have long been suspected for YEARS**\n\nThere is freaking evidence so for team want to say the \u201crumors\u201d and all that tells me that is is not them directly stating these things but a generic copy and pasted response. This is an issue that so many leading figures have long been trying to warn the world about, even John Oliver has fantastic pieces covering this issue if you are curious\n\nThe fact is that China is commuting serious crimes against humanity in it\u2019s country who has a very long history of commuting atrocities on it\u2019s own soil and tries to black list amd tear apart anyone and any business and country if they should ever bring up any of those things!!! These are not rumors!!! This is all proven for years now!!!\n\nThis deals with the very lives of so many people there who have done nothing wrong but to be born of a different ethnicity in China and are being forced to adopt the same exact customs and lifestyle as the \u201cHan\u201d Chinese who are the majority. \n\nChina has been doing this for over two thousand years as the first emperor of China did the very same thing when he United all 6 states to form the country that we know as China",

We all know he has no shot of working in any Western market, and what would you have him do, become a Korean citizen?\n\nHe's said a lot that he wants to use music to uplift people, and give his country men a sense of pride. He is not able to do that without obeying the CCP. If the CCP want him to show support, he has to do it. If they want him to show more, he has to show more.\n\nThere's something so inherently privileged about people who come for c-idols from the safety of their western democracies. No matter how rich and privileged you are, if you live in a despotic country you have to obey the despot. That's the unfortunate reality, that a lot of people come from despotic places. And that's their home. And they don't really have another. A lot of artists throw away their family and trade for a Western democracy passport, but they lose a lot in the process.\n\nI don't associate the camps with Lay, because I know that even if he wasn't used for CCP propaganda, even if he wasn't famous, the camps would still be there. And some other celeb would be in Lay's place, for CCP propaganda.",

Though i was expecting a tweet on weibo like last time, i was certainly not expecting such a big move, bcuz it will  cost both lay and jackson a huge amount of income loss.\n\ni couldnt possibly support an artist that has done this twice now.

Because it IS conflicting in ways that might be hard to understand for not only others but you. Things aren\u2019t as black/white all the time, even if it feels like they \u00abshould\u00bb be. After all, fans spend their time listening to their favorite idols music and watching videos and forming some sort of \u00abbond\u00bb more or less. \n\nNow, what is going on in China is a huge issue in a capacity I don\u2019t really understand/know much about as I\u2019m not updated on everything that has happend. But I do know that it is conflicting, and at the end of the day you gotta make that decision if you want to continue listening to him or not. Besides... we do not know idols. We might never know if he actually supports the CCP or not, if he thinks this is okay or if he\u2019s forced to act as if it is. And the thing is that is with EVERY idol on every issue, not just this.\n\nI am a firm believer personally of seperating the artist from their work, which is an unpopular opinion on this sub it seems, and I get that it\u2019s not for everyone. Plus it might feel morally wrong for you to support him by streaming his music for example and that is 100% understandable. I would say if you can manage to seperate him from his songs, you could still listen to them in ways where he can\u2019t get paid if that makes you feel better (and if you for example already bought the music/own it, well... it\u2019s already done). And if it STILL feels wrong or if you can\u2019t get that same enjoyment, don\u2019t listen to him. It\u2019s ultimately up to you. I know I listen to idols who have done shitty things.

He has talked about signing chinese artists (singers, idols, actors), so he will probably have agents, directors, producers, etc. \n\nI think he has this vision that China could definitely do better when it comes to training talent and having a big platform for them to perform on. \nHe also seems to really want to open up Chinese entertainment to the outside world. He said something on a tv show about how he wishes this new generation of idols can improve and show it outside instead of only focusing on the domestic market. \n\nRight now it seems like the industry is still very much restricted, not like the Japanese one, but there's still very little effort in trying to achieve success outside because they can make a lot of money in China. Which in turn makes it difficult for foreign fans to have access to it.\n\nJackson has about 70 employees under him right now, I have no idea how many investors he has, but nonetheless he needs to be very careful not to torpedo his career if he wants to continue expanding his dream. \n\nI also wonder about his family dynamics! \n\nHis older brother is an Australian resident I believe. He talks very little about him, I assume because of his brother's job and family. I feel like his brother will most likely live the rest of his life there as well. \n\nJackson's parents were very much against him going to Korea to pursue his dream of being a singer. Both were sports athletes, they seem very traditional parents, but im not sure of course. \n\nHis grandparents are also an interesting part of him growing up, because he spent the summers with them in Shanghai growing up. \n\nThe grandmother was a nurse and the grandfather was a very distinguished Doctor, who won an award for being a pioneer in sonogram (? Have no idea if it's written like this, something to do with using CT technology for the first time in China).\n\nWhat really surprised me was the fact that his grandfather participated in the Korean War. He was the leader of a team of doctors and nurses who went to North Korea to help treat wounded soldiers. He actually received a medal for his service there. Him and his colleagues also joined the communist party after the war.\n\nSo his family history is pretty interesting. I have no idea if he truly supports the party or just can't risk opposing it. \n\nWhat does everyone think?",

Going to say something honestly - this is a problem for americans only.\n\nI'm in the UK and every generation there's a point where the US goes \"Commies are bad!\" \"Lets get the reds!\" and so on. Only a couple of years ago (and even now) it was \"'Them Russians!\" again. Been that way since the 1950s. In the UK we know everyone is just as bad as everyone else..including the human rights abuses by the USA.\n\nNorth Korean work camps? US prison chain gangs. Prisoner abuse in the middle east? Gitmo and approved torture overseas blacksites. Life is not black and white everywhere is a nice evil shade of grey. As much as they can get away with.\n\nReading about this whole thing in the press I did some Googling and found the BBC of all places do a promo about the automated farming equipment (giant harvesters) being used in that area to farm cotton. A very tiny amount is done by humans manually because they can't go fast enough for the profits of fashion brands. They are even using drones now! (thanks YouTube)\n\nThe UK is just as bad with the fashion brand Boohoo that just bought up a ton of companies that Boohoo itself uses sweatshop labour right here in the UK, got exposed and did a \"we didn't know\" and life continues on.\n\nThe fact is for nationalists if someone bashes your country you defend it. Bet those americans are readying an anonymous downvote right now. Same goes for the Chinese with this, and with the Korean hate mob going around this week 200,000 strong calling for bans (and getting them) and boycotts on any Korean drama series that isn't 100% historically accurate - even if its a show about zombies with a \"this is fiction\" disclaimer at the start!\n\nFact is for Jackson being a model for a brand when it's stores are being closed and logos hidden is not good business. Separating himself from trouble is, and just like the brand that hid all traces of the bully scandal G-IDLE member from their adverts you drop what's bad for your brand (be it person or company.)",

It\u2019s generally known that bad things happen to people who reject or openly don\u2019t support the CCP. For people like Jackson, it\u2019s further complicated. He may not *actually* support the CCP but he has to openly and publicly support the CCP and the actions of the party to remain a popular public figure in China, or risk disappearing or something happening to his family",

I just want to share my honest thoughts, and why I'm still ok with Jackson and the other idols.\n\nFrom what I've heard (I rlly can't confirm if this is really true tho), apparently these claims about Xinjiang genocide/mistreatment might actually be **false**. I'm not that culturally aware, but if you think about it, what would China gain from extreme mistreatment of their own people? A lot of Xinjiang people are standing up and saying that these accusations are false, so this made me rethink all this news we've heard. \n\n1. Who started making claims of the mistreatment of Xinjiang people first? As in, who started these accusations, and on what basis?\n2. Has anyone actually gone to Xinjiang and proved that Uyghur genocide is really taking place? (I actually really wanna know about this, so plz lemme know if I'm missing any info)\n\nAnyways onto the actual topic, I think pride for his country has always been a part of Jackson's identity, and I may be among the minority here who thinks this, but we're not in a place to judge him for that.\n\nAnyways, those are just my thoughts on the situation. It's just that I didn't see many comments bringing up this side of the situation. Please feel free to clarify anything, but I hope you all consider what I've written so far. All of this was written without any ill content, and I may have misunderstood something, but I also think that we shouldn't be so quick to assume things about China as a country, or about Jackson and the other celebrities.",

Since we talk about morality, it is a concept that can vary from person to person and it is absolute that, as it is unfortunate for you, someone else don\u2019t see the same things as you for a myriad of reasons. \n\nIt boils down to a matter of choice. This is where I see \u201ccancel culture\u201d and \u201cboycotts\u201d only becoming relevant. The celebrity has made their choice and it is a matter of time if their influence affects other people\u2019s thinking. You can choose to stop supporting them, and it is valid but I cannot bring others to think the same as I do. As everything in this world is politicized (not political) as the post puts it, everything in this world is also subject to years of struggle until society naturally changes. My belief in one thing is one step, hoping the rest of the world follows. \n\nThat choice doesn\u2019t also dictate your beliefs in life. If one person continues to support because they like the music and the other withdraws support because his support for something you personally don\u2019t believe in bothers you, both SHOULD be fine. It supposed to not make one a bad person because there are so many reasons why things are the way they are. It is different for you as it is different for them. \n\nI personally cannot associate Jackson, and other international Chinese celebrities with their nationalism and support for China. It also doesn\u2019t affect how I see the Chinese government which definitely has a lot of problems. \n\nThe boycott against Xinjiang cotton might have moved a needle in one part of the world but the reality is it might have not moved anything in China among its people. We look at them with wonder but they also do the same to us. We might continue to question their thoughts and actions but they will do the same to us. \n\nIn summary, it boils down to choice whether one supports Jackson or not BASED on his political beliefs. We, as a society, lived for thousands of years without a struggle. It\u2019s not as simple as we may think it seems.",

They also argue that the current [economy of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China) constitutes a form of state capitalism.\n\n([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nThe **capitalist state** is the [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)), its functions and the form of organization it takes within [capitalist socioeconomic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_mode_of_production_(Marxist_theory)).[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_state#cite_note-Recent_theories_of_the_capitalist_State,_1977-1) This concept is often used interchangeably with the concept of the modern state, though despite their common functions there are many recognized differences in sociological characteristics among capitalist states.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_state#cite_note-Morishima_1976,_1-2)\n\nThe primary functions of the capitalist state are to provide a legal framework and infrastructural framework conducive to [business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business) enterprise and the [accumulation of capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulation_of_capital). Different normative theories exist on the necessary and appropriate function of the state in a [capitalist economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_economy), with proponents of [*laissez-faire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire) favoring a state limited to the provision of [public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)) and safeguarding private property rights while proponents of [interventionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_interventionism) stress the importance of regulation, intervention and macroeconomic stabilization for providing a favorable environment for the accumulation of capital and business.\n\n([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_state)) \n\nit isn't communist because communism is a stateless , classless, moneyless  society, pretty much the opposite of the CCP.",

Jackson and many other Chinese artists (Wang Yibo, Dilireba, Deng Lun... an endless list) have done the same. If you think they are all brainwashed or bought by their government, you will be simply further dehumanizing Chinese people, who are the force behind this movement.",

Your comment about buying into Western Propaganda could easily be reversed onto the idea of Chinese Propaganda. No one is trying to dehumanize Chinese people, but it\u2019s literally insane to compare propaganda from a Communist country that doesn\u2019t have freedom of speech to Western Countries. Also interesting enough, you talk about Chinese people being dehumanized, when the whole situation is about China extremely dehumanizing people themselves, Uighur Muslims.",

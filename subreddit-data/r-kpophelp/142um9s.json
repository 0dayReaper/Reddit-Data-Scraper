Some tracks from said playlist that I think would live together nicely with it...\n\nfor that nostalgic hit: **Life's Too Short** \\- aespa, **Drive** \\- NCT Dream, **Good Life** \\- WayV\n\nfor the vibes: **Kazino** \\- Bibi, **Hello Sunset** \\- Red Velvet, **Easy** \\- WJSN The Black\n\na bit more of that fun energy: **Kick It** \\- Blackpink, **Red Sun** \\- Brave Girls\n\nsome fave tracks not in my summer playlist (I keep it to 50 tracks max) but still has those fun/nostalgic/vibey notes:\n\n**Cheers!** \\- Joohee, **Happy** \\- Taeyeon, **Thank you** \\- Apink, **Selfish** \\- Moonbyul feat Seulgi, **Dive with you** \\- Seori feat eaJ, **Memories of Summer Rain** \\- Weeekly\n\n*edit:* oops, *Hello Sunset*, not *Hello Future* lol, although the latter is def a great summer track if not in line with OP's prompt",

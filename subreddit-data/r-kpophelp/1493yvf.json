It\u2019s pretty straight forward and since you have time, read over all of the info on the ticketmaster site m, and make sure you have your card details presaved if you can to save time during buying. You need the app for your ticket not sure if you can get it as I couldn\u2019t since I\u2019m not in North America, but if not you can just log into your online account and they\u2019ll show up, don\u2019t think tickets get posted out anymore it\u2019s all digital these days. If you have Apple wallet or whatever the android equivalent is, you can save your tickets to that ahead of the show so you don\u2019t have to worry about low signal or anything \u263a\ufe0f",

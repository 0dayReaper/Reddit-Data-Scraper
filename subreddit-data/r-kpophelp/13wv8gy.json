I often see videos of how well ateez and the staff get along with each other. Im wondering if KQ is still a  good company, since now they have other groups like xikers oder maddox. (Every post I found regarding this is multiple years old, so ateez was their only group back then)",

As a Block B fan they\u2019re not exactly in *my* good graces, but Ateez seems to like the company. At the end of the day, a company is a company, and I don\u2019t think even the most seemingly ethical Kpop company can be considered a \u201cgreat\u201d company.",

Obviously there is conference with upper management, but the little things that make a group perform better and be treated better are up to the individual management teams, everything from schedule to promotions to diets. \n\n(AFAIK. Take this with a grain of salt)",

            "comment": "They're not perfect, but definitely have kept ateez happy and I think they'll take care of xikers as well. It seems that they have a good staff who all the boys really adore and always say nice things about and several of them left other companies as trainees for kq because of how badly they were being treated at their old companies. They kind of built their trainee program around Ateez, because at first it was literally just Hongjoong taking music lessons from their main producer Eden who didn't know how to teach music stuff formally and had a lot of his own worries that he couldn't do it well. There have definitely been growing pains and trial and error scenarios as a result, but I think Ateez kind of likes that they get to be a little offbeat in ways they probably couldn't at other companies. \n\nThere's a lot of misinformation around about the stuff with block b being mistreated on their subsidiary label. The rumors were started by a Korean fan who was upset a member was dating and used her ability to be believed by ifans to spread a lot of nasty shit about the company that persists to this day. While I'm sure there is likely some level of truth, you will see people complaining that they weren't releasing new music when several of them were actively in the military, complaints that one of them wasn't allowed to live stream when he was actually doing 4 hour long live streams all the time and one time a several day long live stream where he made a staff member kill a chicken for him and that they had to pay for their own music videos (something they wanted and negotiated for to get paid better and then decide how much they wanted to spend on it rather than having the cost taken out before they were paid which is what most companies do. This is actually the reason they were on a subsidiary of their own. Their contracts were really unique for them because their old company had screwed them and mismanaged their money and they wanted more control over where it got spent) \n\nAnyway, I would caution anyone to not believe things about any group/company that just gets parrotted around with no source. Don't just believe me without question, either. I don't have receipts on hand. Things just fall into an echo chamber on tiktok and Twitter and on here and people repeat things they hear without a source about a lot of groups or companies and it's really concerning.",

They have close relationships with their managers, music production team, and other staff.\n\nThey seem to have a close relationship with the CEO aka \"Father\" (still laughing thinking of Hongjoong getting everyone to chant \"DADDY\" at a concert) based on how they speak of him and how he regularly buys them gifts (including personal ones like buying San a new monitor and fancy keyboard/mouse, for example).  You know Wooyoung has barged into his office for no good reason more than once!",

When Ateez debuted Block B was pretty much already in their end stage. Also while seven seasons belongs to kq they probably have different managements. Ateez' main producer Eden has also not worked with Block B before. \n\nOverall I see no reason for kq to start mismanaging Ateez. They are their money makers. They are the reason kq had the budget to debut another group. And overall it seems like Ateez and their management get along quite well. Maybe besides Ateez being a bit overworked and deserving a break.",

For ateez, I feel like they could do better in terms of giving the members artistic freedom in releasing music and covers they work on. Ateez could use some vacation time tbh. The only break was when covid hit.\n\nI do wish they would focus on their other artists like Maddox. Like send him on music shows and have more music releases. He's now in Edenary so I guess he's content in his position at the company. KQ had other artists that they just failed and who had to leave because I think KQ's sole priority was ateez at the time.",

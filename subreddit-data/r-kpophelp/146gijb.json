    "postText": "So abt 3 months ago or so, theres was a photo of Soojin circulating around social media and it got me thinking abt what idols do eventually when they happen to withdraw from group/the industry. I know that unfortunately many are afraid to come back to the spotlight seeing as they would probably receive major backlash from the overall public, hence why i personally think it might be hard or even impossible for someone like Garam to be on stage again btw. \n\nEventually i happen to wonder what these idols do yk ? So for Soojin for example she has a very good dancing background and ofc her years of experience on stage could be very helpfull, so im always thinking abt the possibility of her maybe being a dance teacher in a academy somewhere in Seoul or even working for a smaller label helping the trainees.

Many left and took up regulation 9 to 5 jobs. Some of them got married and are moms/dads. A couple of them unfortunately passed away at a young age.\n\nI am in a group chat for the fans of a certain group, and most of the members (all except one who stopped contacting the others) are in it. I get updated on their whereabouts every now and then, and while one member still releases his own music and has tons of love for his group and his fans, the other two members were never as outgoing nor outroverted and felt overwhelmed by the attention they got from the media. I do get curious about what they're up to, but I respect their decision to stay low-profile and would never prod into their personal boundaries.",

The said group released a surprise single in 2012 for their 10th anniversary, and the one member (who I'll call \"H\" in this comment) who still has love for his past was the one who messaged all he remaining fans in their old fan cafe (now mostly defunct/dormant), announced that he dug a new fan cafe in celebration of their 10th year, and convinced the other members to record something for their fans. He also dug the group chat a few years back. H then invited \"T\", one of the low-profile members in the GC, and \"J\", the leader and my bias of the group, finally joined last year after declining numerous times out of \"feeling awkward.\"\n\nI became their fan and joined the new cafe and GC just over two years ago (I know, super late for a group that was active so briefly and had been inactive for so long). I'm (27) one of the youngest people in the chat, but luckily, no one ostracizes me for being \"young\" or not being familiar with the fandom culture of the early to mid-2000s. They're all very sweet and understanding! The members are all in their forties and many of the other fans (mostly in their thirties, but I've seen one other person who said they're my age and also a newer fan) bond over raising kids, health issues, work, etc. H reminisces about his group career A LOT, cracks jokes about how his soon-to-be-teenager daughter takes a lot after him, and he'll give updates on any music projects he's working on. T is mostly quiet but he drops by a few times to leave replies or share some photos of his adorable son. J is mostly off the radar (according to H and the other fans, he doesn't even check his personal DMs or texts often) but he'll drop by often to crack dad jokes or engage in funny banter with the other fans. They're more down-to-earth than I expected, and I bet you wouldn't even guess that they used to be singers if you come across them on the street.",

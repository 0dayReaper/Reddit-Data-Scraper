    "postText": "can anyone recommend some new bgs to follow that have more group stans than solo stans or general fandom unity? I\u2019ve been a fan of NCT since 2016 but it seems like the majority of the fandom consists of solo stans who don\u2019t really care about things like unequal lines, promotions, or how foreign members are treated as long as it doesn\u2019t affect their bias. I\u2019m kind of looking for something similar to the camaraderie and unity found among groups in earlier gens like SHINee, 2PM, and BTOB. Any recommendations would be appreciated, thanks!",

(NGL I see half the them changing their bias on the daily, and we tend to just swap out terms for solo CBs or for dramas based on who's turn it is)\n\nThere's very little tolerance for purely solo stans in the fandom, so you won't see them often, and with the Monstas themselves sharply discouraging any solo stans in the past it set a standard that's carried over.\n\nWe even have a day of the week devoted to each member.\n\nMaknae Monday (Changkyun/IM)\n\nSunshine Tuesday (Minhyuk)\n\nWonho Wednesday (Wonho...obviously. lol)\n\nHyungwon Thursday (Hyungwon...okay..we might not have been too creative with some naming)\n\nFlexer Friday (Kihyun)\n\nShownu Saturday (yeah...Shownu)\n\nHoney Sunday (Jooheon/Joohoney)\n\nOur hashtag is #MXAppreciationBeBe over on Twitter if you ever want to join us.\n\n(Right now it's Jooheon's CB though, so that tag is pretty quiet since we're focusing on Jooheon for right now)",

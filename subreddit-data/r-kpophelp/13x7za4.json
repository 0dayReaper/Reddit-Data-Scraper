She's only had 2 songs chart in South Korea, Maybe If &amp; Very Slowly, which are both OSTs. \n\nI'm not sure if the reason is due to her still being a small artist (her success is fairly recent), or due to her music not being that appealing to Koreans (a lot of her older songs especially had NSFW lyrics, which is less acceptable in Korea than in the US).",

Just checking if I can have the VIP ticket I bought as tixel to have the VIP benefits and if they don't can I still get in as GA? Additionally, would I need the sellers ID I have seen it in sone threads.\n\nIf anyone has personal experience with VIP resold to you lmk. Like do they also check the name and all or is Rod Laver Arena more relaxed. I ideally want to see the soundcheck or grab merch but its alright if I rly cant and can just go GA.",

If you see the vip email its mostly ID needed for merch pickup but soundcheck should be fine. It rly is up to how strict they are checking.",

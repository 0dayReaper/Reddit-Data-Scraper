This is correct, for BND they are running a prize draw for people entering using the hashtag and proving that they're streaming with screenshots :) have a look in the notices and it'll tell you the full info but the prizes are signed Polaroids! There are three events running currently - a streaming event, a download event and a creative contest event all with prizes of signed polas or limited edition pc sets.\n\nWelcome to the BND weverse \ud83e\udd70",

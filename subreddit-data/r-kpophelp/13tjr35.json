I'm thinking of the situation with BTS' J-Hope when, in the early days, he didn't receive much fan mail or attention and toxic people actually demanded Big Hit fire him \"because he wasn't good looking enough.\"",

With top groups like txt im not sure there are any situations like J-hopes. \n\nThough there are groups where one member is more known to non fans (i'd honestly say txt is one of them with Yeonjun)",

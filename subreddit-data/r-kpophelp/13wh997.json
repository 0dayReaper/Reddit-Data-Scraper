    "postText": "I need help finding this out, so I just bought some NCT DOJAEJUNG merch on SM\u2019s official shop website and after completing my purchase, I got an email saying I earned points, and that I apparently have 697.8 (what a random decimal point lol) of them so I wanted to see if I could use them in a future purchase. There was a link in the email to find out \u201chow to earn more points\u201d so I clicked it and it brought me to a page on the SM shop website that just has the word \u201cRewards\u201d at the top of the web page with no information or anything underneath it, leaving me confused if there really is a reward system. I could\u2019ve sworn they had one when I bought an album from NCT DREAM like 4 years ago and used up some points to get a discount code, but it seems the website has been updated at least visually so maybe it\u2019s changed and I don\u2019t know if anyone else has wondered this if they discovered that blank webpage like I did. Anyways, I thought I\u2019d ask, and please let me know if anyone has encountered this! Thanks!",

I\u2019m not really sure what\u2019s going on. I made another account in case and I did get points so I\u2019m not really sure if they\u2019re re-working it, or if it\u2019s down.",

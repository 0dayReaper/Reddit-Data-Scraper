    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI just bought tickets for NCT Dreams Seoul show tomorrow (Thursday, Jun 1st) on Yes24 Global Site, no complications, it was really convenient. \nAfterwards I got the booking confirmation saying **\u201cDelivery Method: smart  ticket (ticketN) - (Before entering the venue, tag a smart ticket to the ticket inspector and enter.)\u201d!**\n\nDoes anyone know what that means, do I have to pick up the ticket at the venue? I didn\u2019t get a QR code or so, just this email. There\u2019s also nothing in my Yes24 account (except for the confirmation). Is it that simple, just showing [this email](https://twitter.com/omselini/status/1663749118324527106?s=46&amp;t=ihHG_Muwdo3G9CGkcSg0zQ)?\n\nHope anyone can help, I was searching through reddit but didn\u2019t find anyone with the same issue.\n\nHighly appreciated!!!\n\n\n-- SOLVED: picked up the ticket right before the show by showing my booking confirmation and ID at the [smart ticket booth](https://twitter.com/dreammakerlive/status/1663787465847758848?t=JMxYr5s7ye0EUTnEOS2law&amp;s=19) at the venue --",

Just go to the Smart Ticket booth with your ID, line up at the designated table (sorted by the first letter of the name you bought the ticket with) and then get a paper ticket!\nThere are tons of staff around that are happy to help you, and they call the booth \u201cglobal ticket\u201d - not smart ticket as on the pic, so don\u2019t be confused! \ud83e\udd2d\n\nI didn\u2019t see anything about bag policy, but they didn\u2019t check mine (had a normal small tote bag with me, lightstick, water, phone, \u2026)!\n\nENJOY THE SHOW! It was amazing \u2600\ufe0f",

Lol we're currently on a trip. We happened to see 2 girls walk past us in Myeongdong with the concert tee/lightsitcks late last night so we immediately bought the 2 seats that were available without thinking. It's going to be an experience to see a kpop group in SK. I'm so excited~\n\nDid you happened to see any Seoul location selling the mini lightstick keyring? We both own the normally lightsticks back in our home country so we didn't want to buy a new one.",

But Korean shows hit different \ud83d\udd25\n\nYou were already in Myeongdong but no luck there? I just bought the WayV mini keyring there yesterday and saw tons of others (but not sure about NCT). Have you tried other Kpop shops like Musinsa, WithMuu or Ktown4u in Hongdae? Or Hottracks (various location) might have them \ud83e\uddd0 \nBut my biggest guess would still be the underground shopping in Myeongdong!\n\nGood luck finding it\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb did you see the dresscode advise? I went in my [PJs](https://twitter.com/omselini/status/1664191968333950976?s=46&amp;t=ihHG_Muwdo3G9CGkcSg0zQ ) yesterday, it was fun (but unfortunately in Korea they don\u2019t seem to follow these \ud83e\udd72)",

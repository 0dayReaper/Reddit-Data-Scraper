    "postText": "I know that Forestella's music is very unique within the kpop sphere and might not even be considered kpop, I'm not sure. But I've been listening to save our lives (and moonlight and dear name, also by Forestella) a lot recently and I'm wondering if there are any kpop songs that are similar to it? Or just kpop songs with a fantastical/magical vibe? Non kpop songs are also welcome honestly if there aren't any kpop songs that you can think off. \n\nI've already checked out E'last and their first 2 title tracks definitely scratched that itch. I also tried to listen to some of Kingdom's music but it wasn't exactly what I wanted, though I did find a few songs by them that I liked. Feel free to recommend some E'last/Kingdom bsides you think I might've missed if you want to! Or something else :)\n\n[here'](https://youtu.be/1BfSo6R5lK8)s the song in question.",

It's not super often this style of music overlaps with pop. The one I can think of is [ATEEZ's Answer (Kingdom Version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V93FjmiIuk) since it features the vocals of LA POEM.",

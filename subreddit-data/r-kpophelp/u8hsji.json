    "postText": "Over the years as a KPOP stan, there are a lot of facts that are hard to accept, especially as a younger stan. But becoming more mature myself I just learned that things happened because it's life. The kpop industry is brutal and money talks the loudest here. Personally, I've learned to accept that:\n\n1. Some members have more solo gigs simply because they are more profitable. As much as I want my bias to have more opportunities, the company would probably give it to another member because they would bring in more money with the same or less effort\n2. Older groups despite their legacy can be replaceable. Especially for big and established companies, the reputation of a company built by senior groups can bring enough attention to rookie groups. Disbanding an older group after they reach their peak and debuting a younger one, fresh-faced ones can simply be more beneficial and can gain more attention, especially from the public. \n\nWhat are the things that you learned to just accept it as a kpop stan?",

In fact, it makes it even creepier. Imagine living your life, not knowing that you're being watched, or who you're being watched by.\n\nThe fact that it's \"unofficial\" information (not released by their label, unconfirmed by Jennie or G-Dragon etc)  doesn't make it any better either, IMO",

Intentionally or not. \n\nBut because the idols are packaged in such neat ways, I find it hard to blend what I am fed by the companies and my own real life experience. I mean, its freaking genius marketing. In Western music, I listen to music because I like the song, I don't particularly put effort into following anyone in particular other than a few accounts on social media etc - I just consume the music, but Kpop is different. It draws you into the band, the idol's themselves and their \"personalities\", the music, the whole nine yards that you end up being quite mentally invested. So when the perfect package comes tumbling down its a real bitter pill.",

You know the kind I mean - 20 minute videos with before-and-after photos etc. It makes idols uncomfortable, and even worse, the \"expose\" tone makes it out to be some kind of shameful secret.\n\nWouldn't it be cool if we just all went \"Oh, new comeback.

They appreciate their fans but there is no possible way they could know, or care for each individual person. The sooner you realize it, the healthier your Kpop experience will be.",

When an idol says \"I love [fanclub]\" it can feel honest and healthily distanced. You see video going around of things that happened at concerts and fansigns and people always talk about \"that Shawol\" or \"the Monbebe that x\" or whatever and it feels very communal. (I think a lot about the ARMY that invented \"I will sue Min Yoongi\" talking years later about her marriage and how other ARMYs congratulated her in the comments of the video.) When a western artist says \"I love my fans\" it feels very general and distant, but when a kpop idol invokes their fancolor or fanclub name it feels very personal, not just \"fans of our music\" but people who have chosen to put themselves in a specific group.\n\nI think it's one of the healthiest ways I've seen of trying to deal with the parasocial firewall in a way that feels intimate but still safe for everyone. Obviously there are people who wildly overstep boundaries in both directions, and companies train idols very well to maintain professionality even when fans act up, but as a general institution it's one of my favorite things about kpop, and I think it's only getting healthier as time goes on.",

It was the only reason BH even came up on his radar. It probably played a large part in JK signing on as a trainee with BH, over other (potentially more established) labels that were reportedly wooing him.\n\nIt was pure chance that JK even stumbled across RM's music. RM was in Seoul, JK was in Busan, chances are their paths would never have crossed.\n\nAcknowledging that happenstance played a huge part in JK joining BTS' lineup in no way detracts from all they have done, or achieved, as a group.\n\nHope those fans think about this, before they start coming for peeps.",

I almost don't want to mention this because I don't have a source handy, but I remember seeing a Korean community post last year (from Pann or something similar) pointing to a survey that said that the top reason that youth today want to become idols  is so they can date celebrities lol.\n\nI also want to add that even if the members of a group *did* debut because they dreamt of being idols, it doesn't mean that they're going to want to be idols forever. And deciding to disband doesn't necessarily mean that it was all fake or that they didn't enjoy being idols, they might just want to move on from that phase in their life. I think this can be hard for some fans to accept \u2013 they feel like it MUST be because of some company mistreatment or something, because of course their idols \"love\" them and they're \"brothers/sisters\" who want to stay together as a group no matter what. In reality, it's normal for people to just want to work a different job after 7-10 years and to have different priorities at 28 vs 18. (Although obviously company mistreatment and mismanagement does happen, don't get me wrong.)",

Yes the more they become famous over here, the more every little bit of affection is gonna become analyzed and \u201cwritten about\u201d, but you really need to know how to wade through that and keep it moving. There have been times that I have lost friends because they either showed their true delulu colors or hated that I am a \u201cmulti\u201d because they don\u2019t want to see anything on their timelines other than BTS. I\u2019ve blocked those with a quickness. My timeline is 80% Army, 10% Ahgase and  10% shawol. I\u2019ve curated it enough I think now that I don\u2019t see the solos or the shippers and if I do accidentally interact with one because I liked a fan page tweet, then I block before it gets too insane. \n\nIt\u2019s honestly nothing I haven\u2019t dealt with before being a fangirl in the late 90s-early 2000s. But this new fan service brings out the inner delusional in some fans. It\u2019s insane. \n\nEvery fan base has its toxicity. Army isn\u2019t the only one. They get a little too defensive yes, but half the time it\u2019s because Atiny and Blinks start shit with them unnecessarily.

Time, maturity, being in each other's company so much, maybe?\n\nSadly, they also lost a dearly beloved member. \n\nif nothing else, I think the loss underlined to them just how uncertain life can be, and how they should cherish each other. \n\nThese days, they still squabble, but like an old married couple. \n\nLike their maknae Taemin pointed out, they quarrel but can't seem to stay away from each other LOL\n\nIn fact, Minho seems highkey obsessed with Key, and u[nquestioningly buys him every present he's ever asked for](https://youtu.be/MjjZX7-sbzU?t=340) (Key believes in birthday requests as he has very specific tastes and damn is his taste good LOL)\n\nMinho also [acted like a clingy girlfriend](https://youtu.be/bKtsdFEFZmQ?t=134) on national TV, and started yelling at Key for ghosting him while they were both enlisted, and also complained about the [lack of a welcome](https://youtu.be/bKtsdFEFZmQ?t=253) from Key when he was finally discharged (Key's first words were \"You could have at least changed out of your uniform\"), claiming it had \"scarred him for life\" and [demanding Key \"fix his broken heart\"](https://youtu.be/bKtsdFEFZmQ?t=315) (calm down Minho LOL).\n\nAnd [Key does aegyo](https://youtu.be/MjjZX7-sbzU?t=149) or [dials up the OTT](https://youtu.be/bKtsdFEFZmQ?t=85) just to annoy the sh\\*t out of Minho LOL\n\nSo yeah, your comment about members getting along better because they've worked things out after being thrown together so much does make sense.",

Sometimes they apologise, sometimes they don't, but what I've noticed with recent \"scandals\" is that it's the idols' fanbases that escalate the problem tenfold by viciously attacking anybody raising concern over it. Like seriously, the english speaking international fandom can be vicious, gaslighty and violently racist. \nAs a POC stan, either you endure or you stop listening to the genre. It is what it is\n\n2) The idol industry isn't meant to be progressive. It is sexist, and it's not queer friendly. Companies are starting to cater to western sensibilities maybe, but the status quo is the way it is, and it won't change unless South Korea changes\n\n3) That there are absolutely incredible groups (CLC, 1Team, Rainbow) that will never make it, when \"less\" talented people, or groups with less good discographies will thrive. Nobody deserves anything in that industry and it's a hard and ungrateful job. It is what it is\n\n4) he may be an abusive sociopath, but the Jaden Jeong era discography of Loona was way better and Loona's music has been in decline since So Bad (I'm sorry orbits, I know y'all are shooters but please don't kill me). They need to heal their Jeong trauma and pull the songs that he directed from the vault! \n\n\n\nAs for your first point, it's quite obviously the case, no? Of course a member with more solo gigs is more profitable? Idk can you elaborate on what you meant please?",

No matter what happens, idols will get older and so will you. Over time your tastes will change and so will theirs. The only guarantee in kpop is that every idol gets old.\n2. No idol on stage looks that good naturally. Every idol undergoes beauty treatments and a lot of makeup + styling from professionals. Not every idol undergoes plastic surgery, but nearly all of them will receive treatments like preventative botox or laser scalping.\n3. The majority of kpop groups fail. Its just that most of them are so nugu, you never hear about them. Even the ones you hear about are still likely going to fail, its just the nature of the market. A kpop group can have all the talent and skill in the world, but if their company doesn't have the money to promote them or gathers a loyal fanbase, they will die out. Luck is a major factor because the world is simply not fair.\n4. Every idol puts on a public face. Very few people ever truly know what an idol's genuine personality is like.\n5. An idol is just a product for a company and that product needs to be profitable. If they are no longer profitable, they will be tossed aside and replaced with someone that can generate profit. \n6. Idols are the bottom of the celebrity totem pole and are treated as such within Korea. Actors, famous athletes, and directors are given far more respect than idols. Idols are largely seen as an artificially created formulaic individual. Artists on the other hand are regarded much more highly.\n7. Idols have sex (the adult ones). Idols are beautiful people who frequently interact with other beautiful people and they are all young people. Combine desire with hormones and young people and it just naturally happens.\n8. The company does not care about their fanbase beyond what is necessary to keep them happy enough so that they continually give money to them. The company's only goal is to make profit and all fans are to them is a source of money. Companies do not care about how fans may perceive them unless its enough to affect their profits. Many fans will complain to YG about not having Blackpink release more music, but it costs a lot of money for YG to do a comeback (millions of dollars). YG would much rather just have Blackpink continue to be social influencers and gobble up modeling contracts because it costs them far less money. If fans wanted YG to change their ways, they would vote with their wallets. By refusing to buy for Blackpink, fans can force YG to change their business practice. If a corporation isn't making money, they will change their business practices until they do.",

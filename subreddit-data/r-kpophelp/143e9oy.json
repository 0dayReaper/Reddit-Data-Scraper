    "postText": "Last night, the sale of tickets for the TWICE concert in singapore opened, in the queue for the purchase of tickets there were about 120,000 people, and that was just the pre-sale, but the place where the concert will be held, the Singapore Indoor Stadium, has a capacity of just 15,000 people. And situations like this haven't just happened to TWICE. The Philippine Arena, the largest indoor arena in the world, seats 55,000 people, and has long become a regular stop for K-pop groups. First Seventeen performed there, then BLACKPINK, TXT will have a concert there in August, and TWICE in October. But when you look at the tour dates of all these groups for other concerts in countries of the sea, only BLACKPINK really had a large-scale tour of this region, with concerts in large capacity stadiums in several countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia , etc. In addition to large capacity shows in Chinese territories such as Hong Kong and Taiwan.\r  \n\r  \nNow when we look at other groups the situation is the exact opposite, there are few whos in other Asian countries other than Japan, normally it is one, at most two concerts only, and always in places of 10 to 15 thousand capacity, never shows in really big venues, the Philippines being apparently the only exception.\r  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, it has now become frequent for K-pop groups, mainly f and big companies (HYBE, JYP, SM) to have entire concert seasons in the USA, which reach 8, 9, 10 concerts, even more sometimes. On the other hand, you rarely have concerts in other countries outside of Asia. In fact, only recently has citation improved for other countries. SM has started to send its groups to Europe and Latin America. JYP has started booking concerts in Oceania and Europe. However, I find it curious that HYBE, which of all companies is the one that seems to have the most global pretensions, is proving to be the most limited in terms of tours, sending its groups only to the USA.\r  \n\r  \nThe question I have to ask is: why such a focus on shows in the US to the detriment of other countries, especially in Asian countries? You see, the sea has always been one of the main consumers of K-pop, after all in Asia K-pop is in fact popular and consumed by the general public, unlike in the West where, even though there are many K-pop fans , it is still a very restricted audience, mainly in the USA.\r  \n\r  \nAs I understand BLACKPINK having concerts at such huge venues in so many countries in Asia, as far as I know they are the most popular K-pop group in many of the countries across the sea and are one of the most popular in China, they certainly have an audience giant over there. But I don't understand why other groups don't do the same. Why so few concerts in Asia and why are there always small venues? And why do the Philippines seem to be the only exception? And why so much focus on the US when most of your audience is not even in that country? Is there any specific reason for this or is it just about making more profit? If that's the case, is the US really so lucrative for K-pop that companies only care about that one country?",

It's a customer information  obligation that's I think EU-wide ? So there's no surprise inflation at checkout. Plus since TM has competitors selling the same seats, they also can't apply outrageous booking fees, they need to align with said competitors (so the fees are like, a few euros at most).\n\nLiveNation+Ticketmaster (which are a single company) are a quasi-monopoly in the US, you basically can't tour there without them (if you try to, the choice of venues is very limited). It allows them to do whatever they want and make money off anybody who wants to attend live events.",

Many kpop groups also have direct relationships with Americsn labels. Those labels will assist with tours to make them go easier.\n\nIt is also easier to tour in America than many other countries. Bigger venues in foreign countries may already be booked or ask for more money to use them for a concert.\n\nAmerica also has TM willing to take the blame for high ticket prices. The lack of laws mean a company can sell tickets for $1000+ but let TM take the blame when the company is also making money off the fees.\n\nCompanies go where the money is and the US is the perfect place for extremely profitable tours.",

SEA probably feels more like a sure bet that can wait. \n\nBlackpink benefits from having less frequent comebacks so they have more time to tour. \n\nI also think we overestimate how many groups have the demand for a full scale tour. I think only a handful of the major ones can get out there and some groups have had to learn that the hard way as they have failed to sell out.",

Some states in the US are bigger than a lot of countries, so having 8 shows in different regions around the US serves 8 separate actual markets, whereas in a smaller country, 8 separate shows might not be doable and fillable in the same way. Even with 8 shows, I still see a lot of people here having to fly to one of the cities or at least drive fast enough that they need a hotel. The US is geographically huge in addition to being a large market. Singapore, by contrast, is much smaller, and a group needs to have the location based sales to prove that they can fill a venue in order to book it. Also a lot of people in other western countries who complain about the US getting so many shows tend to forget that the US actually has a sizeable actual Korean immigrant population, especially Los Angeles.",

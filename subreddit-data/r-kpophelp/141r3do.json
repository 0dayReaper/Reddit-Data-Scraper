Also I am not really saying that there is no way to objectively evaluate  a performance, obviously if you had a group kinda straight faced and lazily moving their arms while dancing people would notice. The problem is this. Lets say you made a list with groups that have a decent following and asked people to put a check on any group they think fits the description, the list would be almost completelly checked out after a few days. I just don't see any way this post is actually helpful to anyone. Its just people coming in, seeing their favourite groups and upvoting them.",

Looks? Talent? How they look at the cameras and the live audience? I think it's a combination of all three and what appeals personally to them. Within a group, fans do have a bias.

Instead of just acting, facial expressions should feel genuine and feel like an extension of their movements.  We definitely see that with their intense choreos but I loved seeing this flirty, charismatic, confident side.

I only knew Felix when I started listening to Stray Kids, but I learned all of their names and fell in love with all of them quickly because they're so captivating to watch as performers -- both as individuals and as a team. There's this electric energy between them, and I think it's so strong both because of their teamwork and because each of them exudes powerful individual stage presence.\n\nStray Kids is my No. 1 pick, but I would add Treasure, Dreamcatcher and Everglow, as well.\n\nAlso, completely agree with your choices of Blackpink, Itzy and SHINee (no shade to the others, I'm just not familiar with them).",

            "comment": "Seventeen and TXT have amazing stage presence in my opinion.  Seventeen dominate the stage and fill it with whatever feeling the song they're performing has, and they really get that feeling across to the audience really well.  Every single member brings something unique to the performance without compromising the synchronization that SVT is known for, and I often find myself rewatching their performances over and over again because it feels new and fresh  and impactful every time.  Stage presence, to me, isn't just being confident and charismatic, but being able to really reach the audience with your performance, and since Seventeen's performances can make me really excited (for the exciting songs) or make me cry (with the more emotional songs, and I'll be honest, I *rarely* cry because of a song), I consider them as having good stage presence.  The subunit BooSeokSoon has LEGENDARY stage presence, too - they can turn an entire audience of fellow idols into their fans and get them to dance with them, and they just own the entire venue.  Watch their performance at the latest Circle Chart awards and you'll see what I mean.\n\nTXT have stage presence as in it's hard to take your eyes off them.  They do the choreography so well and perform their individual lines so well that the performances just flow naturally and even though they aren't as intense as groups like Ateez or Stray Kids, who also have great stage presence in my opinion, they're memorable in their own way.\n\nNow for some girl groups.  I'd recommend (G)I-DLE and H1-KEY.  I'm not a fan of (G)I-DLE, but from what I have seen of their performances, they have some of the same qualities I see in boy groups with good stage presence: they're confident, charismatic, and portray their song and concept well in each performance.  H1-KEY are younger and they're still rookies, so even though they're not at the same level, I still find that they, in a similar way to TXT, perform in a way that flows and they're always full of energy, so it's hard to take your eyes off them and they fill the stage with happiness whenever I watch them.\n\nIf you're open to checking out older groups, watch some performances by H.O.T.  I still can't pinpoint exactly what gives them such good stage presence - maybe it's their choreography that fills the space or their vocals and energetic performances, but they really set the standard for all kpop groups to follow, so it wouldn't make sense to not give credit to their stage presence and how it just makes perfect sense to be fully immersed in their performance.",

Other than the usual compliments that they are awesome performers and concept chamaleons, Enhypen are also really great at complementing each other, which I think is an undervalued form of performance chemistry: being able to not overshadow each other while showcasing their abilities and charms. \n\nHere's a recent example at last year's [KBS Song Festival](https://youtu.be/xFPyq_1VM0s). Or [this](https://youtu.be/2MZM5wu9uDE). Or this from their recent [comeback](https://youtu.be/6p1u9BspPPI). Also I will put this [here](https://youtu.be/wPevsbgX3SQ) because catching attention while doing softer concepts is something not all idols can do. \n\nTheir presence and performance ability is also the reason why various of fan edits on TikTok became viral: [Jake Freak Edit](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM26ojcS6/), [Jay Big Boy](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM26oL4P9/), [this Ni-ki edit](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM26oC58J/), [this Sunoo edit](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM26oSPhs/), [sunghoon wow](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM26o5fby/), [this Heeseung edit](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM26o9SAW/), [Jungwon dancing](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM26oAWEH/). And this without counting their viral videos on their own account. \n\nBeing on a survival show also think helped because the producers took this into account, how much they could command a stage, and fans were obviously attracted to those who could catch their attention on the video performances.",

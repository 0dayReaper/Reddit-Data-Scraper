    "postText": "This is just my personal opinion- not saying it\u2019s facts or anything. Lately it seems to me that Black pinks work has been pretty mediocre and repetitive. I almost feel they know how popular they are in America (probably due to their looks and fashion) and they no longer feel the need to produce new and exciting music to keep up with Korean Girl Groups (Red velvet, twice, etc.) In comparison to other girl groups choreography and music, blackpinks is so boring- yet they get away with it. \n\nAnother point I want to bring up to back my theory is that what is up with all the American collaborations? \nTo be honest, icecream is really what prompted me to write this because the whole song is practically in English. Now I know that\u2019s nothing new and that many groups have done that. It\u2019s just the fact it is an overused concept of I\u2019m a food item, cute, eat me, lick me lyrics.",

            "comment": "I think \u201chaving more appeal to Western fans\u201d is more a YG Entertainment thing than a BlackPink thing.  I personally do believe that despite that constraint and YG\u2019s tendency to limit releases and promotions for their artists, BlackPink does what they do well, and deserve their slot as one of the top 3 girl groups.\n\nAs for crossing over to the US market, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been an important intention of K-Pop \u201cfor years.\u201d  Dominating Asia has long been enough for them, and most attempts at crossing over (by BoA, The Wonder Girls, etc) have been half-hearted and unsuccessful\u2014as long as they had a market in China, breaking into the West wasn\u2019t a big deal for K-Pop companies.\n\nThen a few years ago that THAAD thing happened, where South Korea approved the adoption of a US missile defense system to protect themselves from North Korea, and China hated that...so the \u201cban\u201d on Korean entertainment in China took effect, Chinese K-Pop artists took to having their careers in home soil, and some groups like Mixx even disbanded as a result.  Groups like EXO and WJSN are still dealing with the effects of being divided that way.  And, of course, China stopped being an expected source of a lot of income for K-Pop.  And *that* was when having K-Pop cross over to the US became a more viable and important option, hence BTS and BlackPink and increasingly more common collaborations between Western and K-Pop artists.",

In the early 2000s China was spending less on recorded music than Switzerland or Turkey.  \n\nThen two things happened at the same time: the Internet, and China growing a huge middle class with money to spend.\n\nThe internet made inroads to the West possible, and all that money made inroads in China possible.\n\nTHAAD was just a sideshow, and there's still plenty of money and deals being made in China.  It's just that China tends to rip everybody off  (see EXO), while the US music business, as sleazy as it is, at least follows international contract and copyright laws",

From the verse to the pre-hook, there's a change. From the second hook to the bridge, there's a change. They want to be able to change your emotion every time, which we love because that allows us to be more musical,\" Yip added.\n\nI'm bringing this up because I think it shows that there is an idea that in order to appeal to American audiences, they need to dumb it down, or make it more simplistic. And that could be what is happening. So the pre-existing audience in america who likes them specifically because they are making something different will become distanced as they try to make something with more mass appeal.",

Not 2020!!\nAt this point, we all know YG is doing it for the money and doesn't give a duck about music quality or what Blackpink wants. Because they give the girls 1comeback/year of course Blinks will eat it out because is Blackpink.\nI'm sorry for Blackpink and I hope they won't resign with this $hitty yg when the time comes.\nThey deserve good quality music. I don't care if Teddy produced 1000+ hits. If he doesn't give a damn about the quality of his artists music then is a huge turn off for me.\nAre a lot of incredible producers out there!

In my opinion they lost the touch and uniqueness they once had. Now with their new song Ice Cream I did actually like it mainly because it was different than ddududu, kill this love, and how you like that. But still Ice Cream is such a simple song there really isn't much to it and although it was really cool that they collabed with Selena Gomez, I did not feel like she added much to the song overall. IMHO Blackpink has lost their touch and perhaps it is because they are trying to comply to westerners idk. Also the entire Kill this love mini album was just not it for me, the side tracks did not feel like it was the best they could have put out. I would also like to add that I really like the members, I think they are beautiful and seem to be so kind, it is just that after ddududu I stopped enjoying their music (with the exception of Ice Cream which I like but it's really not the best thing they've come up with)",

                            "comment": "Obviously im a blink so imma be biased. But yes Blackpink do get fame for the bare minimum but it also makes sense why they are the most popular. Most of their songs are made with the western audience as their primary target audience and with korean being the second. Plus Blackpink have a lot of English lyrics and thats because western people like to know the words they listen. And the way Blackpink release music, once a year is similar to how Western artists release music. Blackpink music is more westernised but it appeals to a wider audience than many other groups, plus there constant collabs get them more liked. Most groups wouldn't appeal to Americans and the ones that do, their whole discography wouldn't be loved like blackpinks is. So i think it kinda makes sense why blackpink is the most popular girl group, although annoying for kpop fans and korean audience it is perfect for western audiences. Plus although they have generic aand little discography i think BP still have work hard, maybe not as hard as other groups but i think the members are deserving of the popularity. Plus the girl crush concept is more favoured than cute concepts hence one of the why Everglow has become so big internationally.",

I\u2019m not a blink so I don\u2019t know a lot but you can see how dedicated Lisa is alone, let alone the rest of the girls. Speaking of them although they aren\u2019t releasing music as much as other groups (YG groups in general don\u2019t release music as often as other groups) you can see how much they\u2019ve been improving. For instance, Jisoo in the beginning stood out to me because she didn\u2019t really keep up with the other girls dance wise, and now she is much better as a dancer, and is steadily improving. As for Jennie, she has gotten much better control singing wise. She use to be really loud and shouty, for lack of a better word, and now her control is coming along nicely. When she belted \u201cso sweet\u201d in Ice Cream it sounded full yet not overpowering.\n\nNow to address the mediocre thing. Now I may come off as sensitive but in my opinion that\u2019s a bit much. Lisa is one of the best dancers in the new generation. She\u2019s not my favorite but it\u2019s hard to deny her talent. She\u2019s also a great rapper, not the best but if YG works on who SHE is as a rapper, she could excel (to me it sounds like she imitating someone). Regardless the flow and tone are both there. Now Jennie is a multitalented woman who needs to be shown off more. Ros\u00e9 is a great singer, now I know a lot of people hate her voice, and she is being made to put on a more nasally high pitched voice, but after listening to the \u201cIf It Was You\u201d cover, I retracted a lot of bad opinions about her. She\u2019s also very agile. While Ros\u00e9 is light and agile, Jisoo perfectly balances it with her rich and low vocals. People put them against each other but to me they\u2019re just two completely different vocalists. So what I\u2019m coming to is that the girls themselves are far from mediocre.\n\nNow about their music. Like I said before, I\u2019m not a fan so I\u2019m not sitting here worshiping their discography, but honestly, I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s so bad/mediocre? I think it\u2019s just not some people\u2019s cup of tea, but instead of leaving it at that, they\u2019re making it as if somethings wrong with the music itself.\n\nEvery artist or company behind the artist has a goal, something to accomplish with their artist. For some J-pop acts, it\u2019s literally to make people smile, and they do that. I see them get a lot of flack (especially after P48) for being \u201cuntalented\u201d, when you don\u2019t have to be an amazing singer or dancer to envoke joy with your art.\n\nAs for BlackPink, their target audience is (obviously) America, so their dances are easier &amp; repetitive. But I don\u2019t see that as a bad thing, I see it as a different style and approach. The choreographer for Michael Jackson referred to BTS as \u201cover-choreographed\u201d, a lot of people I know personally hate most K-pop choreography, and the ones they do like are, in a sense, less complicated. That doesn\u2019t mean they \u201cjust like mediocrity\u201d that just means they have a different perspective and opinion.",

Sure, you can say it's not for you and move on but people drag their balls through 10 miles of glass just to bring the girls down. \n\nWhile i don't follow other groups just as closely, I've been going through what k-pop as an industry has to offer for months now. BP just has the perfect combination. Looks, talent, luck. They have it all. Ros\u00e9 and Jisoo pretty much bests any other vocalists in GGs. Jennie and Lisa can rap really well, and sing pretty good when needed. I won't even talk about Lisa's dancing because she's the certified GOAT. They have the perfect combination of greatly written songs just for their ranges and being that talented. Like it or not, you can't deny they're GOOD. Like, really good. They may not be for some people but they're nowhere near undeserving of their success. \n\nIt all boils down to people being jealous as fuck though lmao.",

Other songs will probably have more of a Korean sound to it, hopefully.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I don't like it when they try to cater to westerners either, but every company that knows its group is doing well in a particular area will try to cater to it. It's business. YG in particular is accustomed to having more of a western sound. This started way back in the day, before BLACKPINK. BigBang had this western appeal, too.",

It's their right to do whatever they want to appeal to the international market, but in all honestly I don't like it when they sing mostly in English because what I like about Korean pop is, precisely, the \"Korean\" aspect. \n\nRegarding this latest Ice Cream MV, I dislike the basic melody and the overly sexual tone of the song. It's something any half naked N. Minaj and the like already do, why step so low? They have plenty of talent and could do without it. Also, many young girls are blinkies. \n\nI am no blinkie and no ARMY, just someone who has listened to Korean music for many, many years. Thank you for respecting my opinion even if you disagree.",

I realised BTS were doing this, and I was instantly displeased. But as a fan we can\u2019t really demand anything and need to accept that they are growing and changing; the only thing we can do is find other groups which cater to our preferences (I found that in Stray Kids and DAY6!)",

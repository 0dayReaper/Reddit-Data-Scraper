I manually clear it. iPhones are only likely susceptible to malware if the phone itself is jailbroken, the user has been the victim of a phishing attack or they are running outdated iOS software. Outside of these variables the average user is not going to have malware on their iphone. And malware is not going to create site-specific pop-ups localized to a single website.\n\nBased on the other comments here, it\u2019s pretty telling this is an issue with the kprofiles site rather than something happening on OP\u2019s side.",

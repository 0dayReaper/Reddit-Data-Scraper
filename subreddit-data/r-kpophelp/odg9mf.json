    "postText": "Hey y'all,\n\nTrying to find out who this idol is. I remember hearing about an idol who accidentally bought like 10,000 masks (or some absurd amount of masks) at the start of the pandemic and because of that, whenever you'd see their group out anywhere they'd all be wearing the same masks because they bought so many. \n\nI have no idea who this is and I've tried googling it/searching on reddit and nothing. I have a vague recollection of it being someone from SVT but I really have no idea who from SVT it would be (if anyone at all)\n\nIf y'all know who this is, please let me know, thanks!!",

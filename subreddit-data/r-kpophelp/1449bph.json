    "postText": "Hi, I have recently obtained about 2 Cat1Tickets at Standing Pen D. However, our queue number is quite large at 59xx. - I was wondering how many people does each standing pen in the Singapore Indoor Stadium can fit as I'm worried that being in the back might actually affect me and my friend's vision from watching the concert with all the phones and stuff. FYI, I am about 176cm and my friend is 180cm.\n\nAlso, if we were to proceed with this standing, is it recommended to squeeze at the front during the concert or hang out at the back? I thought that squeezing at the front would have the phones hindering our vision so maybe the back but we could face the same problem.\n\nWe're also going to be trying for the second day tickets for a better queue number. Is there also a recommended standing pen to pick from compared to 59xx at Pen D previously?\n\nThanks!",

That seems to constantly be a problem in SG concerts unfortunately from what I\u2019ve seen/heard.",

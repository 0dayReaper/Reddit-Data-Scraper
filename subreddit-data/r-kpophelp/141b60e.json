    "postText": "hi!\n\nso, i preordered taeyong's album and also bought some magazines but one of them has been stuck on \"preparing item\" even though the magazine came out months ago and i'm scared it will hold up my order. i'm only anxious about it because i'm moving in a couple weeks and was really hoping it would be shipped out ASAP, but now i'm scared it'll get help up because of this magazine and it will be delivered when i don't live here anymore.\n\nhow can i cancel the magazine but not the rest of the order? i try to use the bot to do it but it says the \"we need the item name and number\" then the \"end of conversation\" thing pops up and i can't give them the name or number.\n\ndoes anyone know how to actually cancel one item?\n\nthanks!",

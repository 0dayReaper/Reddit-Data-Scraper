    "postText": "So it's my best friends birthday coming up, and I have no clue on what to get her at all. I have a spending limit of about 140$ \nFor context, some groups that she likes are SHINee, BTS, Stray Kids, Woodz, Itzy, mamamoo, Seventeen, Ateez, Enhypen, CIX, P1harmony, and Onewe. I'm really unsure of what to get her I want to get things that will be meaningful for her. Even though I know she'll appreciate anything as her family doesn't really get her anything kpop related.",

            "comment": "WOODZ just released a new album. he has 3 versions so maybe she doenst have them yet? OO-LI. and it is in stock on most sites( I love woodz too) Ateez is about to release dvd/bluray of their tour and have a new album on the 16.  Stray kids have a new album, 5 star, Enhypen new one Dark Blood. You could easily grab an album from each of them for under 140. good luck! you are such a nice friend.\n\nif you are in the US target has stray kids and enhypen albums on sale now. stray kids 24 and enhypen 21. I just bought some last night, lol dont get too caught up on the different versions. she will be happy with any one of them. they are the same thing music wise just different stuff in the albums",

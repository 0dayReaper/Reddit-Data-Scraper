    "postText": "Song: https://youtu.be/9r8zBdgsJEE\n\n1. The percussion with the reverbs at 0:02 sound so distinctive to this genre.\n2. The prechorus instrumentals has this specific dreamy quality 0:40 - 0:55.\n3. But most of all it\u2019s the chorus! It just sounds like a particular song I\u2019ve definitely heard before.\n\nThe artists I\u2019m thinking of is similar to Air and Zero 7. The latter is probably [the closest one](https://youtu.be/U_OKigBRqBI), and that might be it? But I feel there\u2019s something a bit closer\u2026 Please help if you have a guess!",

It's very video gamey, almost like bossa nova with a Japanese RPG-like quality on top.\n\n[This Japanese song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6nD2f9K2DU) gives me a similar vibe but a lot more chill, similar to the Zero 7 song you linked.\n\nThe chorus doesn't ring a bell for me otherwise, sorry. Let us know if you find it! I didn't know this tripleS song and I'm really enjoying it.",

I see a lot of people call this genre spacepop or dream pop but ngl those titles seem kinda made up lmao. I think new jack swing would be the best description.",

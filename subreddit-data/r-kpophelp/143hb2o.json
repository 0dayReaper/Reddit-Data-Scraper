    "postText": "I've seen some recent posts of translated netizen comments of various Korean posts about the lawsuit, including the Blind post made by an anonymous SM employee, where netizens are favoring SM. I know those translated comments are like if stan Twitter comments were translated, so I'm curious as a non-EXO-L what the opinions of Korean EXO-L is. Are opinions divided, is there lots of support for CBX, or is it a mixed bag? \n\nI've been a Cassie for 14 years meaning I was a fan during the JYJ lawsuit, so I know how things went during that time. It started with so much support for JYJ that Korean Cassiopeia filed a complaint with the FTC, and the FTC found after an investigation in 2010 that SM had \"unfair exclusive contracts that their celebrities and trainees had signed.\" https://omonatheydidnt.livejournal.com/5471987.html",

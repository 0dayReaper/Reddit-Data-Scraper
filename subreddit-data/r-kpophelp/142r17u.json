            "comment": "You should ask the go organizer, but I'm pretty sure you'll be able to chose the album version you want. The only thing is that the first who join a go can claim any pre-order benefits they want. Then, the second joining can choose from what it's left, and so on. Once the organizer gets the albums then they sort the albums/inclusions based on everyones favorites. Organizers are thoughtful most of the time they try to give everyone the albums/pcs/pob they want, so if you ask for a certain photocard or album they'd try to sort it out.\n\nYou also have to make sure if there's many people in the go who want their albums sealed, since that reduces the chances of getting the inclusions you want. If there's 10 people in a go but 8 want their albums sealed you can only sort what's in those 2 albums left.\n\n\nHopefully I explained myself well!",

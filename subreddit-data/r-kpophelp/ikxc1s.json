    "postText": "He passed away 1 week ago, to my group's surprise. He never told any of us - i'm sure this is because he did not want any of us to worry, this matches his character. He did not come out with us for basically the whole of this year, although we texted almost daily. I thought this was maybe due to his parents and covid, but obviously not.\n\nI'm completely devastated. He helped me through my depression in high school and we were going to the same university. I really regret judging his music choices so harshly without ever checking it out myself. Whenever he would play a Korean song at karaoke or in the car I wouldn't let him hear the end of it, I would basically tease him for not actually being Korean (I'm half Japanese and he is full Australian) but loving the music. I think it got to the point where he was too embarrassed to play it or talk about it.\n\nI'm such an idiot for having such a closed mind, I really want to give this a try. I do remember his favourite song, which was a girl group where they had school uniforms and they were doing ballet style dance moves. I remember actually liking the song, but I was too stubborn to admit that I liked it, but I really want to start off there. Does anyone know what this song is? I'm sorry that the description is vague, that is all I remember. I think I liked the song because it sounded like an anime kind of intro but actually had really good vocals.\n\nCan anyone else recommend me other similar songs? I generally like pop-rock style music that is catchy and up-beat or stuff that you can dance to.\n\nI'm really sorry if I've put too much personal stuff for this sub, but I feel like complete shit and typing it all out has helped me remember better times.\n\nI'll miss you Tristan, 20 is too young.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you so much to everyone for the super kind words and support. This is really the least I can do and at this point, I actually genuinely really like a lot of the songs recommended. It's such a shame he isn't here to see this, he would be so damn happy (or smug!) to see me admit that I like a lot of kpop songs... Who would have thought. You guys are awesome.\n\nEdit 2: After a few hours of listening down the rabbit-hole, i'd say some of my fave groups are Day6, Gfriend, Dreamcatcher and BTS songs. This has been a really nice few hours.",

Most of us had gravitated towards the genre with very similar beginnings, so many of us can relate to you on that, I understand how remorseful those actions can be on you though, the guilt just destroys so much of your overall feelings that you just feel like you hit rock bottom.. but that\u2019s exactly how we grow and actually mature, which is to learn from these types of things. I know what I\u2019m saying sounds clich\u00e9 and you want to skip it but don\u2019t because these types of things are extreamly useful for a person to hear \u201cwhen they need to\u201d, like right now. Sometimes you need to hear something that you already know, said back to you for things to truly \u201cclick\u201d\n\nAnd yeah man, as a grownass man in his late 20\u2019s I do feel slightly embarrassed about a lot of the groups and artists I like as far as the korean pop genre goes lol but it\u2019s also helping me to truly learn to apply the \u201cdon\u2019t give a fuck what others think\u201d type of mentality that we all learn at one point or another. Even better when you realize that girl groups are meant to appeal to men...not girls like you\u2019d assume. Their looks to their outfits to the charm they give on shows, that\u2019s all meant to pull YOU in as a fan, so embrace it, enjoy it, and let this be the start of a journey into a rabbit hole that you can personally dive in for **yourself, as one of those types of things that only you can enjoy on your own** because I guarentee you that you will find so much enjoyment from this genre into your life lol it really is such an amazing thing to add into your daily life style, as it is a LOT more fun than western music, you\u2019ll learn they do things entirely differently, like you\u2019ll see \u201cvariety shows\u201d all over YouTube where artists will appear on and do a bunch of entertaining activities that you\u2019ll love to watch as it\u2019ll help you grow closer towards the artist and learn new things about them to fuel that enjoyment of the genre!\n\nI know it\u2019ll look overwhelming at first but please don\u2019t let that turn you away, there are tons of channels to help you get into things and to kinda help introduce you to a lot of new ideas and just concepts that people like us aren\u2019t used to in the west. YouTube channel \u201cinternetsnathan\u201d is great at introducing you to groups and introducing you to the genre in general, go give him a sub and be excited for this new journey that your friend would have absolutely loved to see you enjoy :) and let it be a reminder of your friendship with him!!",

I think his experience is one that many kpop fans (including myself) often go through, and I think it\u2019s really sweet what you\u2019re doing this. \n\nIt seems like his favorite song was Rough by GFRIEND, like others said. Assuming this was one of his favorite groups, I\u2019d check out Navillera, Sunrise, and Time for the moon night- These are some of my favorites by that group. \n\nAnyway, to bounce off some more memory lane songs, I\u2019d also recommend Spring Breeze by Wanna One and [In The Same Place from PD101](https://youtu.be/gaUUzyawrro). For emotional songs, Symptoms by SHINee is really beautiful IMO. Maybe you could relate to Slump by Stray Kids too, which is about falling behind someone you were close to/trying not to give up. It has English and Japanese versions as well. \n\nFor more happy/upbeat songs when you\u2019re not in a sad mood, maybe could you mention some songs you like right now? That might be easier for figuring out stuff you\u2019d like. \n\nCondolences again",

I checked out some more of their other songs and I've really liked Fingertip and Me Gustas Tu as well, although they are a little bit upbeat for right now, I would never have thought that I would like rock songs that are also cute...\n\nSpring Breeze is really nice as well, really nice melody to it.",

I'm really surprised, kpop really isn't to different to mainstream music, it seems to have such a range of genres. I'm surprised since I thought all of them would be overly poppy. I guess I just had such a cliche'd view of the genre.",

Your friend was gone too soon, but I'm sure he appreciates what you're doing here.\n\nLike others have commented, the song you described is GFriend's Rough.

            "comment": "My condolences for your loss. I am so sorry to hear about what you are going through, and I am touched by the thoughtful way you are grieving your friend. Kpop actually encompasses a lot of different types of music, it's very likely that you'll stumble upon something you like musically if you search long enough. To be perfectly honest though, if your friend's favorite song is GFriend's \"Rough\", he probably wasn't into Day6, N.Flying or any of the other boy groups as much (even if his taste in music is very varied). There are a lot of groups that are much closer in style to GFriend, namely WJSN, Oh My Girl and Lovelyz. Dreamcatcher is more rock but in spirit pretty similar to GFriend. I am speculating here but your friend might also have liked Twice. Here are some playlists for all of these groups:\n\nOh My Girl: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCrCUv6rQ7I&amp;list=PLun4VQPcrwtIkeUoT\\_ebyAmB4Bn6EVR7L](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCrCUv6rQ7I&amp;list=PLun4VQPcrwtIkeUoT_ebyAmB4Bn6EVR7L)\n\nWJSN: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftyLwZ68LnU&amp;list=PLaq57sKEfJobyDSHffPyYKmUABAQYAvd4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftyLwZ68LnU&amp;list=PLaq57sKEfJobyDSHffPyYKmUABAQYAvd4)\n\nLovelyz: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isls26FGUaA&amp;list=PLGnn6\\_Y3PJ6B\\_NfMYhip8eN3WBelrQhn2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isls26FGUaA&amp;list=PLGnn6_Y3PJ6B_NfMYhip8eN3WBelrQhn2)\n\nTwice: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rtV5esQT6I&amp;list=PLzm9sEXjZ90feWaeV0XuOuRaQqLTHVKDv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rtV5esQT6I&amp;list=PLzm9sEXjZ90feWaeV0XuOuRaQqLTHVKDv)\n\nLovelyz just released an album that I find very GFriend-like in spirit: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nudRdlZ4CE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nudRdlZ4CE) Much like GFriend they also had a lovely sad song during their debut era, Goodbye Like Yesterday [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8xpDBBuyJI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8xpDBBuyJI)\n\nIf you are interested in seeing all the different styles kpop has to offer (that your friend might also have been into), you could take a look at Loona: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEo5bmUKFvI&amp;list=PLn2nfuATkZsQfG8no7wsG2t6GnYtAy8OB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEo5bmUKFvI&amp;list=PLn2nfuATkZsQfG8no7wsG2t6GnYtAy8OB)  \nOn the one hand they have a quite specific signature sound heavily relying on synths, but they also dabble in all kinds of styles, some of which are really experimental and interesting. I think they are great gateway to seeing why kpop is so attractive to many people. I hope you find something that speaks to you and helps you with your loss!",

I can suggest [Here we are](https://youtu.be/Di8CNLpJiLc) and [Eclipse](https://youtu.be/QyH4pyRsBiQ) plus [Labyrinth](https://youtu.be/LH0fh-JHQe0), a more upbeat funky song. Gfriend songs are very Japanese sounding, by the way.  As for pop Rock, I strongly recommend Dreamcatcher, who are sometimes called the dark Gfriend.  Some songs are [Good Night](https://youtu.be/Lxfl8LRab_I), [Fly high](https://youtu.be/39yeTdIuKJU), [Break the wall](https://youtu.be/Gu8vGU1Rr9w      ), and [Red Sun](https://youtu.be/RKBJVdjOHUY).  They are also heavily Japanese-influenced (J-rock).\n\nPerhaps also two 2nd generation group songs, kara - [Damaged lady](https://youtu.be/_vHw17-zFa4) and 9Muses - [Dolls](https://youtu.be/qW6D8rYppwY).  \n\nI hope you find something you like.",

It isn't a huge band but the person who made it, Nam TaeHyun, was in a bigger kpop group called Winner. Anyways, that's how I got into kpop, came from rock songs to korean rock and then eventually also kpop. Another more well-known kpop/rock group is day6.",

Their Japanese original tracks are always good, recently they did 'Lights' 'Stay Gold' and 'Your Eyes Tell'\n\nI love RM's 'mono' mixtape (Moonchild is amazing), and JHope's Hope World mixtape.\n\nAlso, BTS' label mates, their junior group Tomorrow x Together have some great songs that are really feel good and melodic. Some of their softer stuff I like: Nap of a Star, Maze In The Mirror, Fairy of Shampoo (a fun remake of an older song), and 20cm, and their cover of 'In My Blood'\n\nBut, there are songs of every type by them. They are still technically rookies but they are so talented. They just released a Japanese album and an original track 'Everlasting Shine' that was chosen as the new opening of the anime Black Clover, its a really great one.\n\nSorry again for your loss and I hope you've found a lot of great songs and artists! &lt;3",

I've found that having music we shared is a very comforting way to help keep them in my life.  Going through GFRIEND's music is a good starting place now that you know they're one of the groups he liked.  Their newest song (IIRC) is Apple.  You mentioned liking DAY6 so far.  If you haven't heard Zombie, I think it's one of the best songs of this year, but it's a rough one, lyrically.  They released an [English version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WehhSc1knYY) too.\n\nI'm not the first in this thread, but I have to recommend my favourite group, SHINee, because they've made hard times so much easier to get through.  Their music spans many genres, like Kpop groups tend to do, but it has a lot of R&amp;B, funk, and generally retro influences.  [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEHm10Tda6k) a concert medley of some of their upbeat songs that always raises my spirits to watch.  They're known for their amazing live performances.\n\nWe lost Jonghyun, SHINee's main vocalist, in 2017, but he left us with some really fantastic music (he was a songwriter on top of being a singer).  He had a soft heart and a huge amount of compassion for others.  [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UGoCRPO93g) a song he wrote about not being hard on yourself if you're not doing okay and need time to feel better.\n\n(P.S. To other commenters, please consider not offering religion-based condolences to someone whose religious beliefs you don't know for sure.  Just saying from experience, that can be very alienating.)",

Please take some time to do the things you enjoy as well... &lt;3",

I think I can gladly say i'm actually a kpop fan now, which I really didn't expect! I haven't even forced myself to like it, I genuinely have been really into it. Day6 and Dreamcatcher have been some of my faves!",

Honoring him in this way is wonderful; you are allowing his life to influence yours and help you grow. I am sure others have mentioned it (haven\u2019t read every comment), but BTS\u2019s Spring Day is a must, just be prepared to cry when you read the English lyrics.

We are all doing well but it always chills me to hear of others passing away of it, it\u2019s known as the \u2018best\u2019 cancer. Ironic, I know. I\u2019ll think of your friend today. \n\n2 songs that mean a lot to me are by Red Velvet. \u2018I Just\u2019 and \u2018Cool World\u2019. They both have a touch of longing, melancholy and nostalgia that I find beautiful. If you get a chance, listen to them while reading the lyrics, that\u2019s what always cements my love of these songs is once I know what they are about.",

Their mvs are fun and addicting to watch, a lot of their songs are catchy and whole ass bops, and their personalities/dynamics with one another were overall attractive to me. Plus, I watched their debut show (?) Sixteen, and watching that gives you a sort of emotional connection with them,\n\nI\u2019m usually not into \u201ccutesy\u201d girl groups, but TWICE clutched onto me and I had no choice but to stan. Their concepts are becoming more \u201cmature\u201d (how people would mostly describe it) which I find cool how they\u2019ve been recently branching out. If you haven\u2019t already tried to stan them (seems like you\u2019ve tried with many groups so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised) and you\u2019re willing to look into a different sort of group (in regards to your preferences), I\u2019d recommend them just because I personally adore the group and were easy for me to stan!!\n\nSpeaking of a JYP group, ITZY is a group that I think would fit your standards better. I feel a lot of their songs are a hit or miss for people, and at first for me I thought it was a total miss, but then I relistened to their music a few more times and eventually got into it. Their performances are also very cool to watch if you\u2019re into that badass choreo sorta stuff, majority of the group I feel could be main dancers. I\u2019ve watched just a few of those vids where you essentially get to know them, but they were entertaining nonetheless and I genuinely enjoy watching them!!\n\nI have a feeling you\u2019ve attempted to get into these groups already considering their popularity, so my bad if you have heh.",

They also have A LOT of variety and behind the scenes material to get to know the boys. \n\nA.C.E is a relatively underrated boy group but are easy to love. They are 5 members so again names are easy to learn. They are incredibly talented, have a rather unique sound and have a good amount of variety as well. \n\nA girl group I would definitely suggest is Dreamcatcher, who are probably one of the more unique girl group in terms of sound. They are also criminally underrated but again super easy to love.\n\nHope you find some new groups to stan. Just please don't stab anyone.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m gonna stick to my default recommendation and say N.Flying. They debuted in 2015 but are still active, and have added two new members since then, losing one in late 2018-2019. They\u2019re definitely a little family, and it\u2019s so fun to watch them interact. They\u2019re a band, so they play their own instruments, and they\u2019re an absolute blast to see perform.\n\nThe members are:\n\nSeunghyub: Leader, vocalist, lead rapper. Also composes and writes all the group\u2019s music as of 2019. He pretends to be the mature one of the group, but make no mistake he\u2019s just as fucking nuts as the rest of them.\n\nJaehyun: Drummer, former Maknae. Probably the most \u201cout there\u201d of the gang. He\u2019s adorable and expressive and loud, and he\u2019s quite the cheerleader for other groups. He\u2019s super endearing.\n\nCha Hun: Guitarist, vocalist. Also writes and composes. He seems more quiet and laid back, but he\u2019s always caught right up in the group\u2019s antics. Runs a YouTube channel with Jaehyun called 2IDIOTS, and it\u2019s hilarious.\n\nHweseung: Lead vocalist, also former Maknae (yes, they\u2019ve had 3). Stan Hweseung for *talent*, man. His voice is incredible, and he\u2019s been praised by a lot of vocal powerhouses in the industry throughout his career. He started out as an innocent lil bean but he has slowly become more and more chaotic through the years. Joined the group in 2017 with The Real.\n\nDongsung: Bassist, Maknae. Newest member. He\u2019s adorable and good and just gets along with everyone. He\u2019s less involved with the group\u2019s antics, but make no mistake he doesn\u2019t avoid them.\n\nKwangjin: Former bassist, left the group due to a scandal (he was innocent but didn\u2019t want to hurt the group\u2019s image. He\u2019s still on good terms with them and openly supports them). When he was in the group, he was the ultimate stern, fatherly force. He was the second-oldest after Seunghyub, but he just had a way of keeping everyone in check as if he was the oldest. It was funny to watch, because they dormed him with Hweseung, the Maknae at the time, who he took quite a liking to.\n\nSome of my favorite songs from them are their title tracks, namely Hot Potato, The Real, Oh Really, and Rooftop, as well as the newer versions of their debut song Awesome. Though I\u2019m in love with b-sides [Flowerwork](https://youtu.be/Yu-Dpc9s-W4) and [4242](https://youtu.be/L5AEyEeK_mk). There are also a lot of really great member guides.",

I also suggest listening to [canvas](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ng_kdXfThkcItJ4mStXZ398Ct2HtEbjnM) and [who, you](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lIupUk2LTA00yPb_QE1z703SEInioTkMc) by nu'est w. Nu'est w was the subunit created with the remaining members when minhyun was promoting with w1. And to get to know the members and their group dynamic I suggest watching nu'est road ( [1](https://youtu.be/F7nvPdKC09I) [2](https://youtu.be/aKiGiZjhTHs) [3](https://youtu.be/mleU8KET85M) [4](https://youtu.be/FtGw9LFN0R0) ) I hope you'll check them out :)\n\nONEUS - their mvs are all so beautiful and if you have time I suggest you watch all the mvs from their debut...they debuted in 2019 so there's not too many. The song that made me their fan is [Lit](https://youtu.be/ggPF6Wb8A50) And they recently released a single called [Bbusyeo](https://youtu.be/GAWWaoM4aQk) And they also participated in road to kingdom so their performances there were also really good, and [this one](https://youtu.be/bsCRftnx05c) is my favourite.\n\nASTRO - they have a lot of really good songs and their earlier songs are mostly very cute. Their last comeback as a group was in may with mini album gateway( [mv](https://youtu.be/Zz7YZtpz2Ek) ). Moonbin and Sanha also released another album in september called in-out as a subunit ( [mv](https://youtu.be/CeOGfPANy44) ).\n\nI think I already said too much so I'll stop here.",

They are the first group I got into only by watching one performance of them (it was the wonderland performance at kcon and now they are my ult, as it was really easy getting into them since like 99.9% of their content has engsubs).\n\nDreamcatcher is more the rock music type and honestly I never thought I would start ulting them, since i don't really like rock, but ... idk there is just smth about their music that is soo addictive. Like Ateez, I got into them through seeing their performances.. and damn they got some amazing life vocals (obviously also amazing dancers and rappers). I believe I am a heterosexual girl, but alllll the members make me doubt that tbh.\n\nEdit: for me it was really easy getting into both groups since each member has their own charm and no one is really lacking anything and is \"forgettable\".\n\nBut I must admit that I didn't get into those two groups because ppl were always like \"stan atz/dc\". Hell I even avoided them, bcs idk, I was toxic back then and jealous, because from an outsider perspective, they just looked way more successful than some big company artists I liked. Happy now that I grew out of toxicity thanks to them \ud83e\udd27\ud83d\udc96",

There\u2019s only 5 members too so it\u2019s not too difficult to get into them\n\nEdit: omg I literally just discovered wanna one and I\u2019m so sad that they disbanded after I found out about them ;-;",

Vocals, performance, not giving a damn to haters, rising to the top by amazing hard work and work ethic ( people told them they'd be a failure cuz they dont look good enough according to idol standards, they went ahead and broke those stereotypes and are one of the most powerful ggs )\n\nSEVENTEEN [Falling Flower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4iDL3c0T1c) : 13 members means their performance and formations are so amazing and intricate, falling flower is a great example of that. \n\nSTRAY KIDS [Gods Menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQTlCHxyuu8) : they have a song thats called \"Gods Menu\". thats legit enough to check out their other discography. apart from their other content, chans rooms vlives are soothing safe spaces for stays. \n\nLUCY [Flowering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQdFA55hT80) : they are a band , still quiet new, but i love their songs till now. \n\nTHE ROSE [She's In The Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LyLUcYOO8Y) : love love love this band, their music is amazing both recorded and live.",

Their music can get pretty emotional but they don\u2019t shy away from more upbeat sounds.\n\nOneus - Brother group of Onewe (and literally brothers for We\u2019s Dongmyeong and Us\u2019 Xion who are twins). They debuted last year and their discography is still small and easy enough to get into.\n\nVerivery - Another group who debuted last year. Their earlier stuff was influenced by new jack swing and had a bright aesthetic while their newer Face It series veers down a darker path. I like both facets. :)\n\nLucy - A new band that was formed from during Superband and debuted this year. Their leader, Yechan, is a violinist. Their music can veer from elegant to playful. Overall they have an uplifting vibe.",

Nah, those are really chill compared to the MCs I've seen in my 10 years of being a kpop fan. \n\n\nRefusing a burger and getting a smack on the head is NOTHING, really NOTHING, compared to being dragged through the dirt with perverted questions because your group member had a dating scandal, or constantly pitting members from \"rival groups\" against each other, EVEN IF THEY SAID THEY'RE GOOD FRIENDS or sowing seeds of jealousy between members because of individual popularity.\n\n...\n \n\nCreating unnecessary Lovelines and forcing them onto young entertainers. Some of these stick with them their entire career. See Kim Jongkook - Yoon Eunhye - Chae Yeon love triangle, it's been 15 goddamned years since X-Man but if you go onto any recent clip of theirs, you'll see comments like \"Kim Jongkook just marry her already\" or \"Ah I'm sure they dated back then\" or \"If I were Kim Jongkook I'd go for her\". Nah. Nope. Hell no. \n\n...\n\n\nRefusing a burger from a rookie boy group member is tame as hell and gives him more screen time. It's a good thing. Either you're an ace at variety, or a big sunbae, or you're a rookie and that's how you're treated. The camera focuses on with you have to offer, if its nothing special, it focuses on your weaknesses. \n\nThat's why idols prepare individual talents like impersonations, mimicry or weird skills. To stand out and be saved from the rookie treatment. \n\nThat's how k-variety works, and idol shows prepare the idols for the bigger, TV variety world. \n\n\nBig Bang, Suju, DBSK, Shinee, all went through the first phase of being pathetic young boys before developing skills and getting to a more higher level. Now some of them, like Eunkwang, Niel, Key etc. are show hosts. Even legends like Lee Hyori or Rain started out as rookies who had to prepare impersonations of singers.",

They have great music and are very kind and funny. Perhaps you'll find something you enjoy in their discography. :)",

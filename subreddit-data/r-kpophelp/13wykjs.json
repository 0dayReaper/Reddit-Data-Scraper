I\u2019ve looked on many different kpop fashion accounts and nobody has mentioned the earring. \n\nIf anybody does know I would greatly appreciate it!",

The account @bts_style0 looks like it updates frequently. They haven\u2019t listed the earrings yet, but they\u2019ve gotten almost every other part of his outfit so maybe that one will come up soon!\n\nGood luck!",

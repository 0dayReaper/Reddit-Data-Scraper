    "postText": "This sounds kinda insane but I was looking at Le Sserafim stages and while watching I was like damn. Eunchae looks like she'd murder me. Which is kinda weird to think but there's something about her face that gives me creepy doll vibes I guess? Like she'd be killer in a horror movie tbh. Her eyes are like black pits of darkness and I'm living for it. I was thinking about it and I think Yeri from RV kinda gives the same vibes too, less so but still there. So do you guys have any k-pop idols that give major \"doll that will murder you\" vibes??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT : I DON'T MEAN THIS AS AN INSULT I MEAN LIKE it's a very good look for them!! i think they're all really pretty. i think it mainly stems from them looking so doll-like",

Is there any reason for it besides the concept?",

Recently Daewang has started wearing a smaller mask, and on the CEO\u2019s Instagram you can see they they look really similar. On top of that on their bio\u2019s their birthdays are literally the same date, and their height is the same at 5\u20192 (160cm). \n\nDaewang - December 25th 2189\n\nCEO Lee Sohee - December 25th 1992",

    "postText": "When I was a child my mother would always play kpop around me growing since she was a kpop fan herself. As I got older I never really lost interest in kpop until I was in 4th-5th grade. But eventually I realized I shouldn\u2019t care what people think and just like what I enjoy.  Now I\u2019m in my teenager years and still love kpop.\n\nI can never relate to people who go through the \u201cbaby army\u201d phase and the stories of how they found out about kpop \ud83d\ude2d\n\nHas anyone else been introduced to kpop this way?",

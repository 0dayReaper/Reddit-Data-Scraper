    "postText": "There\u2019s a kpop game (iOS app) I really like to play on my phone called K-POP TILES DELUXE. It\u2019s similar to a rhythm game \u2014 you press the piano tiles as they fall down the screen and it plays the song. There were thousands of songs on this app, all kpop songs, and you could \u201cbuy\u201d the songs with in-game currency (music notes) that you earn by playing the songs. I love this game, and I was in the top 8 worldwide or something like that on the leaderboards.\n\n\nA few weeks ago, I tried opening the app, and it just doesn\u2019t load. It just sits there spinning and spinning on the opening screen without loading the app. I tried deleting the app and re-downloading it, and it still doesn\u2019t work. I had been following the app\u2019s Instagram, but their account seems to no longer exist. The app no longer shows up when I search on the App Store. \n\n\nI think the app was probably run by some kpop fans who wanted to make their own game, so I figured it might be known on social media what happened, but I don\u2019t have  much active social media to be able to search or ask around. Has anyone heard anything?",

            "comment": "Googled it and looks like maaaaybe it's still being put out on android (most of the results were for it as an android app), but if it was being put out on both android and ios, then I don't know why the developer would suddenly drop one of those. The link to the ios app store got me the same thing as it did for you when you searched it there, saying it didn't exist there. \n\nDid you update your ios recently? I've had several ios games that I really loved a lot, even some that I had been playing since having them on like the first gen ipod touch a million years before I ever had an iphone. Quite often devs will just stop updating their games. Either they just don't care to work on it anymore, or the game is just many years old by that point and they have moved on to other projects that take all of their focus. Then what happens is the ios of phones keeps getting new updates, to the point of those games no longer working on the current ios without getting any update of their own from their own devs. From what I can gather from googling, it looks like it was last updated in early 2022, and I'm sure ios has had plenty of its own updates since then. \n\nSince it potentially uses copyrighted music (though from the app description it looks like it's piano versions, and not the actual song itself, so this might not be the case here), he could have been formally asked by any of the copyright owners to remove the app from stores.\n\nFound the developer is Ryan Balieiro, this looks like his [website](https://ryanbalieiro.com/). You could try contacting him there to ask about the app or if he plans to reupload it to the app store in the future. If you scroll down on [this page](https://appadvice.com/app/kpop-tiles-deluxe-2022/1450980478) it will show you some similar apps you can search the app store for. But most of them listed here are also by that same developer, and if he removed one app from the store, it's likely he might have removed all his similar apps. Though the ones from him here look like the same kpop tiles games, but just each for a specific group (bts, twice, exo, blackpink, etc). He may have just taken his overall tiles game and broken it up into a bunch of group specific separate apps in order to make more money lol (a general kpop fan buying all of them, instead of just one app, or even something like having the name of the popular groups in the app title helping get more views to the app's pages, and thus more potential downloads of the apps), which like, great, good for him...but I still get annoyed when devs totally get rid of a game without explanation like he might have done with the original tiles game. I've been through this myself with other games and it always hurts. (Like even on a serious note, most ios games like this that are fun and simple, are super addicting, and the devs pulling the games means many players wind up having to stop playing the game cold turkey, and that's just not safe imo.) (I'm still not over losing my fave game Rise of Blobs lol \ud83d\ude05, but in this case, the game download page still exists on the app store, but because the devs haven't updated it in over 5 years, it says on it's app store page something like \"the developer needs to update the app for it to work on your current version of ios,\" and I'm not going to downgrade my ios to a version from 6 years ago just for one game lol...but anyway)\n\nDef try reaching out to the developer and see if he can tell you what's up with the app. If you're looking for any similar apps, I really like magic piano a lot, and other users can create their own songs you can play, so a lot of people put up music from all sorts of artists, and I've seen tons of kpop songs on there. A lot of the time if you find one, and go to the makers profile they will have made a bunch of others too that you can play.",

I can\u2019t remember, but I think I updated recently.\n\n\nEven though the app was updated in early 2022, there were still new songs being added up until a month or two ago, so I don\u2019t think  the developer abandoned it a long time ago. I will definitely contact him to ask! Thank you for your help.",

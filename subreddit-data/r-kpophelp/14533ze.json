    "postText": "I\u2019ve been racking my brain looking for it but it\u2019s been unsuccessful. \n\nIt was a boy group - most likely early debut/second album? One of the lesser known groups at the time. I remember seeing the mv during the end of program bits of variety shows. Don\u2019t remember the definite year but should be around 2012-2015. \n\nThe lyrics were memorable bc it was funny, particularly two lines - something like \u201cyour lips taste like candy\u201d and the second line was basically the same lyric but with satang (basically the korean word for candy) instead of candy \ud83d\ude02. Definitely wasn\u2019t the chorus but the lines leading up to the chorus. \n\nMusic video wise, I don\u2019t remember much. Maybe a light background and all the members just freestyling??",

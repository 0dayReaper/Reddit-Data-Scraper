            "comment": "Floor is standing only. GA floor last year was $250 after fees for one night, and they announced there'll be 3 nights of concerts this year. So if your budget is $650 and you plan to go to all 3 nights, you may want to grab a cheaper seated ticket for at least one. It's a different line-up for each night's concert, so definitely prioritize your favorite groups. I got lucky and all my faves performed on night 1 last year, so I only had to pay for floor tickets once &amp; skipped night 2's concert altogether....\n\nI believe the meet &amp; greet package was about $100 per group. I can't find a receipt in my inbox for the convention badge, but I believe it was in the $30-50 range. The convention badge is good for the whole weekend. And yes, the convention badge is separate from the concert tickets.\n\nThese are last year's numbers. I'm unsure if they'll raise prices this year. Hope this helps!!!",

Since it's performed in the round, there's audience on every side of the stage. There really isn't a bad spot!\n\nEdit: at 11 AM (or was it 1 PM?), employees started handing out numbered wristbands. It took a long time, but eventually everyone got one. And we just had to return a few hours later and queue up in order. But DO NOT camp overnight--downtown LA is not safe at night!",

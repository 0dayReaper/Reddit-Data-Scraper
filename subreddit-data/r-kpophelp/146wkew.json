            "comment": "So, since I like many of the same artists as you do, I will recommend some artists I think you'll appreciate. \n\nBang Yongguk, of B.A.P., is an idol rapper who went solo. His most well-known work (I believe), is [I Remember](https://youtu.be/Z2ae5qRWPCg) which he did with Yang Yo Seop. His most well-known solo song is probably [AM 4:44](https://youtu.be/1kxbuiAAzzU).\n\nFor other idol rapper solo works, I would recommend Bobby's (of iKon) song [Cherry Blossom](https://youtu.be/ZDWzXDTxI4Q) and Joohoney's (of Monsta X) [Freedom](https://youtu.be/QJEolcMlap4).\n\nP1Harmony has some really strong rap-focused songs like [Back Down](https://youtu.be/hE_I_HunRWQ).\n\nI feel like you would know Stray Kids... but if you don't like their main sound, I'll recommend these songs that may fit your taste: [DLMLU](https://youtu.be/Wo4yaT4CUVg), [Streetlight (Changbin)](https://youtu.be/_oCptmj2gIQ), [Love Untold (Hyunjin)](https://youtu.be/hyC1P3COb0o), and [Volcano (Han)](https://youtu.be/SB6VJXA5cYw)\n\nA singer similar to Dvwn (from the few songs I know) is probably WH3N. I really like [Secret](https://youtu.be/Ql5Fl3gzFWo) and [I'm Not Me Without You](https://youtu.be/0UKbt71QNAI).\n\nIf you don't know BIG Naughty yet, you should check him out. [Fxxxxds](https://youtu.be/j7PZv7Ni7pk) feat. Kim Minseok (MeloMance) is a really good song. You should also check out Ash Island if you haven't already. His song [Paranoid](https://youtu.be/rMQ20mMOOuM) is really good.\n\nI'll also recommend Oneus. Their newest song [Erase Me](https://youtu.be/R_BcG3q10k0) is along the same vein as Enhypen's Bite Me (I feel like).",

            "comment": "Pentagon. Dawn used to be in it. A really fun and talented group! I recommend [Daisy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7ZIz4w9Edo), [Dr. Bebe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMIBLloecRI), and the classic I'm sure you've already heard, [Shine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4dH6hEMuwk).\n\nVerivery. They've got great vocalists, amazing choreo, and they can pull off all kinds of concepts like SVT can. Check out [Thunder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBmyToXssjE), [Lay Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2RyGcufXKw), and [Tap Tap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmy6D1KoFsg).",

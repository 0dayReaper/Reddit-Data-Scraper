    "postText": "Basically title. \n\nI wanted to order some of Taeyon's Odd Of Love concert goodies, and found that on the global shop, a keyring for example costs $12, but on the SMtownandstore, it only costs $7. \n\nI mean I know that the global shop is based in the US(iirc) and the other in Korea. But being in Europe, both have the same (horrendous) shipping costs so it basically makes no difference in that regard.\n\nAlso, why does their stock differ so much? Am I the only one getting dizzy constantly having to browse two shops just to make sure I don't miss an item I would've loved to get? Well at least they have in common that the support is terrible and items take forever**(1!)** to ship...",

            "comment": "Everything is based in SK, so the prices for the global shop include the cost of shipping and customs charges to get the stuff to the US, that's why it's more expensive.\n\nThe different stock is probably based in various logistics, getting the stuff to one place, having less storage in the US, some things might just be sold out, they may not be allowed to sell certain things in the US but an individual importing it is allowed etc",

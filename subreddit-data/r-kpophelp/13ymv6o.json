I only accept rookie periods with a profound, objective impact on the entirety of the community (i.e most/all super rookies in the last couple of years have been girl groups). \n\nI'd especially like to see groups that gained huge success on debut despite being from a small (or at least medium-sized) company, and groups that failed to capitalize on their initial success.",

That's just a bunch of names that come to my head now, I don't know if you accept them because your criteria are pretty vague but all these groups found immediate/almost immediate success and were standing out amongst their peers when they were rookies.",

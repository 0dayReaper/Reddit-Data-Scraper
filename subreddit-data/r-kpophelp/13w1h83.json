    "postText": "So I saw videos on tiktok etc saying people ran out of their phone storage esp iphones in the middle of a concert and that they had to clear some apps and pics So, not to have any discomfort during my time in concert, I want to know how much storage do the fancams take up in general and is it necessary to clear prior to the concert? If I have like 100GB storage available in my phone, would it be enough to last till the end of the concert?",

            "comment": "Had this problem before, you need to make sure you store the videos in icloud or you will run out of space (check optimize iphone storage).  I didn't do this when I was front row for BP and I ran out of space and was wondering why my videos would start/stop recording immediately for like 10 minutes.  Keep in mind that you will actually need to have a good amount of icloud storage.\n\n100GB is plenty, I have like 3-4 full concerts on my phone and it's only taken 90GB after checking the optimize space option.  On iCloud, currently it comes out to about 286GB used.",

I remember that my previous iPhone had a 20-minute long fancam that took 13 GB of space. (Video quality of both phones are at maximum)",

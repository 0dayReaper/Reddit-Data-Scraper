    "postText": "So I\u2019m going to a K-pop concert for the first time ever, and I\u2019m thinking about making some custom photo cards of some of the themes in the superstar rhythm games. They would obviously be fake (and I would probably tell people also.)  I\u2019m not super familiar with card giving or the etiquette or overall opinion on this. Would it be ok?\n\nEdit: thank you everyone! I think I\u2019m gonna do it :)",

I know there are good reasons for that, official merch has to be made in a way that is easy to replicate and cost effective so they can make a profit, etc. So I'm not saying anything bad about official stuff. I just think it is a sweet idea and if I received something like that I'd be happy",

Giving out fan-made pcs during concerts and events are very much appreciated and is a common practice as far as i\u2019m aware (: Going around collecting fanmade freebies has been a huge part of my concert experiences in Singapore and Korea.\n\nFanmade pcs are only a problem IF people sell them trying to pass them off as official cards.

    "postText": "Ok so I need this purely for statistics-based reasons, it's not me trying to argue over popularity or anything along those lines. I'm just working on something in regard to popularity patterns and artists.\n\nI need to know roughly what are the Top10 most popular male idols for 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th gen. I generally know roughly the top3 for each one, but I need a bigger scope. Also, just because I need top10 doesn't mean you are obligated to only drop 10 names, if you deem that two or more idols have same level of popularity, you can put them side by side in the same position. Would also appreciate any extra info you feel like adding e.g. *''I think X and Z are equally popular in their gen cause they got similar gigs during their active years and had similar exposure''.* Just so I can get some idea why the ranking is the way it is.\n\nThere is no need to list them in order of popularity or to be overly precise about it since I am looking at the bigger picture mostly, but I would appreciate it if the ranking looks something like this:\n\n*S tier* = top 3 names within their own gen(regardless of order), *A tier* = the rest.\n\nAlso, this is about Korean popularity. Don't mind someone doing a global ranking as well if they feel like it (alongside the Korean one) but please specify it before the ranking so I can be able to tell them apart.",

            "comment": "In no specific order, just based on the names I could remember at the top of my head \ud83d\ude05.\n\n\n- { S Tier } -\n\n\u2022 Kim Heechul - A member of Super Junior (SUJU), and he\u2019s basically a variety idol king of his generation. Very popular for his looks (back in SUJU\u2019s younger days), his variety sense and his love for gg dances. Appears in a A LOT of variety shows both as a set cast member or guest. \n\n\u2022 Key - A member of SHINee and a soloist. And if Kim Heechul is the variety king of 2nd Gen, then Key is basically the variety Prince of 2nd Gen. And just like with Heechul, Key appears on a lot of popular variety shows as a regular cast member or guest. \n\n\u2022 Cha Eunwoo - Member of Astro, and is nicknamed \u201cThe Perfect Visual\u201d or \u201cGod Visual.\u201d Known as both an idol and actor, but his status as an actor is much much higher. As in, most people who know him as an actor probably don\u2019t even know he\u2019s an idol. \n\n\u2022 D.O - Member of EXO, and he\u2019s literally the same as Eunwoo. More popular and well known as an actor and I believe has won a few grand awards for his acting. \n\n\u2022 Boo Seungkwan - A member of SEVENTEEN. Now, if 2nd Gen has Kim Heechul and Key, then 3rd Gen has Boo Seungkwan. Known as this generation\u2019s \u2018King of Variety\u2019 and as \u2018MC Boo\u2019 or  \u2018Professor Boo.\u2019  He has been in a ton of variety shows either as a regular cast member or a guest, and has also mc and hosted a few shows. The only idol IU ever allowed to host her own show (IU\u2019s Pallet). Has won a handful of variety awards, with the most notable being the \u2018Best Male Entertainer\u2019 Daesang, and I believe the only male idol of his generation to win it.  Also known to be the core reason for Seventeen\u2019s rise in popularity in South Korea. \n\n\u2022 Jungkook/ Jimin / V - They are part of BTS, say no more. But, these three specifically are more popular than the other BTS members. I would probably throw in RM, as he\u2019s the one the gp easily recognizes the most probably. But yah ~\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n- { A Tier } -\n\n\u2022 Kang Daniel - Was a member of the hugely popular group Wanna One, and was the #1 most popular member and idol during the group\u2019s active years (Was always competing against Eunwoo, &amp; Jimin for the #1 Brand Reputation spot). He would be considered an S-tier during W1\u2019s heydays, but his popular has drastically dwindled, but he\u2019s still popular enough to be A-tier. Get\u2019s to host a good handful of shows (like he got to host the highly rated successful show \u2018Street Woman Fighter\u2019). \n\n\u2022 Hwang Minhyun - Former member of Nu\u2019est &amp; Wanna One. Now a soloist under Pledis/HYBE, and he is mostly known for his participation as a Wanna One member (the group was HUGE in SK), and as an actor. As acted in a good handful of well known K-Dramas. He\u2019s like in the same category as D.O and Cha Eunwoo. All three are idols &amp; actors, but he would be in a lower popularity status compared to those two, hence he\u2019s A-tier and they are S-tier. \n\n\u2022 Kim Mingyu - Member of SEVENTEEN, mostly very popular in the Kpop community, goes viral quite often for his pictures, and gets invited to alot of fashion show events, and gets a lot of brand deals &amp; endorsements. He does have some gp and industry popularity due to his handful of variety show appearances, especially with fellow member Boo Seungkwan. Out of SVT, him and Seungkwan are the members who go on (and gets invited to appear on) variety shows a lot. \n\n\u2022 P.O - A member of Block B, and is quite popular in the variety scene, and appears in a good handful of popular variety shows both as a regular cast member and a guest. \n\n\u2022 Song Mino - A member of Winner, known as one of the very few idol rappers K-hip hop rappers have acknowledged and respect. Just like with P.O, he is VERY popular in the variety scene and has appeared in a good hand full of variety shows as a regular cast member and guest.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nHonestly speaking, there is no one in 4th Gen that even matches to the popularity of any of these names I listed (and I didn\u2019t list all of them) in South Korea. 4th Gen boy groups barely have any popularity or standing in South Korea, yet alone individual 4th Gen male idols. And that\u2019s the honest facts. You can name all the 4th Gen male idols you want and they wouldn\u2019t be close to these names.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nList of other 2nd &amp; 3rd Gen Male Idols but I can\u2019t be bothered to write a description for all of them \ud83d\ude05:\n\n[S-Tier] - GD (BigBang) // Lee Junho (2PM) // Ok Taecyeon (2PM) // Park Hyunsik  (ZE:A) // Kim Siwon (ZE:A) // Kyuhyun (SUJU) // baekhyun (EXO)\n\n[A-Tier] - Kim Dong-Jun (ZE:A) // Kwanghee (ZE:A) // Eunhyuk (SUJU) // Doo-Joon (Highlight) // Lee Joon (MBLAQ) // KAI (EXO) // Leeteuk (SUJU)",

Eunkwang never runs out of gigs as MC, guesting in variety and singing shows (he has 4 wins in Immortal Songs).\n\nChangsub is currently one of the rising variety stars in Korea -the most popular BTOB member these days- thanks to his viral show Jeongwaja (the latest episode reached 3 million views in 3-4 days, still rising, and [was the #1 trending video in youtube sk](https://twitter.com/btob_info/status/1667098642136838144) along with his recent OST songs also trending) and the attention he gained from his several appearances in I Live Alone.\n\nThere's Sungjae who was at the top during his peak thanks to his dramas (his famous roles in School 2015 and Goblin), his WGM with Joy, variety (especially Master in the House) and CFs ([his Yanolja CF series won 2 daesangs](https://twitter.com/6SungjaeCash/status/1211480257850535936)). After discharge from the military he starred in The Golden Spoon last year, which took all his time, and now he's solely focused on his idol activities with BTOB and attending brand events.\n\nEunkwang and Changsub are also well-respected in the musical community. Eunkwang played Judas in Jesus Christ Superstar's 50th anniversary (the only idol casted) and Changsub is also doing high profile musicals, he's going to be in Memphis with big names.",

I do look at their overall popular during their careers, but ultimately decide based on their current standing with gp. \n\nChanyeol was once very popular, but from what I know and remember his image and reputation is somewhat hanging on a loose thread with the gp. I swear, the only members who are still very much in good standing with the gp are D.O, KAI, Baekhyun, &amp; Xiumin, while everyone else it\u2019s a gamble at this point. \n\nAs for Baekhyun, honestly, I actually had hard time deciding if to put him in S or A tier. Cause I know he\u2019s popular, I mean he\u2019s the first soloist to garner over a million album sales. But, at the same time I rarely ever hear him being talked about within the Kpop sphere and with the gp. I also rarely see him on variety shows unless it\u2019s time for EXO to promote a new comeback or for his solo comeback promotions. It\u2019s not like with Kai who has been on shows without necessarily being because he\u2019s promoting a new comeback. Like he (Kai) has been a regular cast for some variety shows (eg: Idol Dictation). And you don\u2019t get casted as a regular cast member for a variety show unless there is actual demand by the show runners and the gp for you, and if you\u2019re in demand then it basically means you are indeed popular .  So idk. Maybe he is S-tier. Someone correct/clarify with me on this, cause I\u2019m genuinely conflicted with him. \ud83d\ude05",

            "comment": "So for the most popular members of 4th gen boy groups imo:\n\nSTRAY KIDS\n S tier: Hyunjin\n     Definitely one of the most popular 4th gen kpop idols, both for his visuals that fit really well the KBS and his skills as a main dancer. I think the korean public just really loves his visual and the captivating energy he can pull off during performances (has the most popular fan cam)\n A tier: Felix\n     Also a very popular member, very popular visuals, but the fact that he is a \"foreigner\" (coming from Australia) makes it a bit more difficult to be recognized by the korean public. That's a tendency I see a lot with \"foreign\" korean idol, it's not that they can't be popular, it's more like they'll never really be the 'it' boy/girl, like they'll never be the face of Korea. They'll always be seen as \"gyopo\" if you will\nSpecial mention: Bang Chan (internationally)\n     Definitely not the most popular in Korea for the reason mentioned above (and fitting a bit less in the traditional beauty standards) but most probably the most popular internationally. There's this random meme where they made a poll of the 8 most popular kpop idols and 1 to 7 are all BTS and then number 8 is Bang Chan lol. There's a lot of jokes that he is just everywhere, and his weekly Vlives gets millions of viewers and views. I think the fact that he uses English and can be a kind of \"connection\" between international fans who understands English and the world of kpop is what makes him so popular overseas. A bit like Keeho from P1HARMONY, they're the kind of idols that even if you haven't heard of their group, you've heard of them.\n\nTHE BOYZ\n S tier: Hyunjae, Juyeon, Younghoon\n     All 3 of them have insanely good visuals. Younghoon is considered almost like THE definition of the Korean beauty standard (a bit like Eunwoo) and already had a few acting roles (ok success, nothing record breaking)and also MC jobs. So if the company can push him a bit more he could very well become a Eunwoo 2.0. For Juyeon, he's well known for being the best performer of the group (or at least the most pushed one). For example, for the show Kingdom, he had a legendary performance with Hyunjin and San, as faces of their groups (are like that meme 'The overpriced photocards line'). They've also tried to push in variety show so you see his face a lot these days. For Hyunjae, he also fits the KBS extremely well, for example during Kingdom they had to vote for the top visuals and he was 4th (Sunwoo 3rd, Felix 2nd). Him and Juyeon do a lot of pictorials.\n A tier: Sunwoo\n     Also a very popular member, but not as much for his visuals than his humor, his rapper position, and his 2nd maknae position. Another tendency I've noticed is how the youngest of the group often get a popularity boost from it, maybe it makes them more relatable to younger fan idk. But for Sunwoo his popularity is more in the fandom then the general public.\nENHYPEN\n S tier: Sunghoon\n     Member that has the most exposure to the korean general public (for being an MC with Wooyong). Also has a face from a manwha, aka KBS 100%.\n A tier: Niki\n     I'm pretty sure that he is the most popular member of the group, but once again, his popularity is more in his fandom than with the general public. Also again maknae = more popular but not fully korean = less exposure.\nATEEZ\n S tier: San\n     For sure the most popular of the group. 'Face of the group'. Known as a very intense performer. Popular visuals. Not much else to say, kinda overshadows the whole group in term of popularity.\n A tier: Wooyoung\n     Also pretty popular for his performances (for example getting his won Studio CHOM performance)  and his humor/personality. Also popular for his friendship with a lot of other idols (so even if you don't know ATEEZ you might have heard of him) and his ship with San.\n\nOverall, it really depends if you are looking for their popularity in their fandom, or with the general public. And also if it's internationally or in Korea. With general popularity then I think it can really depend on the size of the company. The bigger the company, the more chance for the artists to be known by people that are not necessarily into Kpop. (More promoting, International exposure, TV appearances, etc)",

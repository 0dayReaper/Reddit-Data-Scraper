You can get a taste for what's trendy, and move on from there. \n\nIt's kind of hard to suggest certain groups to people because your taste will be undoubtedly different than mine, just as anyone else's, and you didn't really say what kind of music you typically like. \n\nThere is a huge variety of groups with all different kinds of concepts and sounds. You're bound to find at least one you truly want more of.",

All of their series and trilogies are incredibly good, but I think that to make someone actually listen to a group you need to show them just a few of their best songs. Also Bon Voyage has that rock vibe and it might probably get them their 2nd/3rd win!",

            "comment": "&gt; Any recommendations.\n\nKpop is wayyyy more than music. I would argue the most important thing about Kpop, the one that made it go truly international, was loving the idols themselves. Casuals might send links to a Kpop song, but a true fan is trying to share links of idols being funny, whether intentionally or unintentionally... idols being kind... etc. edit: I'm not gatekeeping, enjoy kpop however you want. I sure do... \n\nSo I would watch some idols shows with subs of groups you are kind of interested in. Fact N Star and Weekly Idol have had some classics.\n\nAnd I would highly recommend watching Produce 101, Sixteen, Girl's Planet, or some reality show that led to the formation of a group.  You will really get to see how talented, hard working, and multi faceted trainees are. \n\nKpop basically is trying to be like your favorite TV show. Like you watched Friends no matter what, because you enjoyed spending half an hour with the characters. You weren't checking to see if the premise for that week's episode sounded funny, you were watching no matter what. This is like Kpop. Fans are ready to support a song no matter what, they care more about the members themselves.",

TXT is definitely a good group if you like BTS (they\u2019re also under HYBE, just in case you didn\u2019t know) they have a very dreamy and beautiful concept that\u2019ll make you feel lots, from running away to a magical land with friends to escape reality (Nine and Three Quarters/Run Away which is a total bop and basically every KPop stan knows and adores the song. Of course each to their own though.) to taking a darker turn with friends misunderstanding you (Can\u2019t You See Me) and lots more. They\u2019re very versatile. They have really good songs, and Ateez is also a really good group if you like intense songs with a powerful and mysterious concept. Seriously, their song \u201cInception\u201d took me on an entire ride. The concept for that song was derived from the movie \u201cInception\u201d, and many other good songs like \u201cDeja Vu\u201d which is really good with a slower beat than most of their songs. \n\nThere\u2019s also other groups like Twice which have a really good discography, Loona, Dreamcatcher, Itzy, Stray Kids, DKB, (not a very well known group), Seventeen, etc.\n\nMost of the groups I mentioned are popular, so if you want to get into more KPop more, groups like this would be a good start.",

Nowadays the K-pop songs doesn\u2019t have that kind of vibe like it used to have tbh, I think the older K-pop stans would understand my point. I will give you some suggestions-\n1. Winner- Really Really, Island, Everyday\n2. Red Velvet- Bad boy\n3. EXO- Monster, Lotto, Growl, Call me baby\n4. Seventeen- Thanks, Clap, Don\u2019t wanna cry\n5. The BOYZ- D.D.D, No air, Bloom Bloom\n6. KARD- Don\u2019t recall, Oh NaNa\n7. Wanna One- Energetic, IPU, Boomerang\n8. NCT- Boss, Baby don\u2019t stop, 7th sense, Regular\n9. GOT7- Look, Teenager, Eclipse, You calling my name\n10. SF9- O Sole Mio, Mamma Mia, Enough\n11. TVXQ- The Chance of Love\n12. G-idle- Senorita, Latata, Hann\n13. Stray Kidz- Mirror, Hellavator\n14. Izone- La Vie En Rose\n15. Vixx- Scentist, Shangrila \n16. 2pm- My house, Make it \n\nMan I suggested a lot and I think there\u2019s soo many more that I can suggest which are just incomparable. I might have suggested boy groups more and left out a lot of great groups. But some of the new K-pop songs are good too such as Seventeen\u2019s Super. Anyway you can try these, hope you like these!",

If you want I can give you a link to my Spotify playlist with like most of their songs in it, or you can just go to their artist profile and press shuffle. All 4 members also have pretty successful solo careers so you should also listen to their individual songs as well!! Hope you find as much joy in listening to them as I do :)))",

Otherwise, Kpop makes use of lots of different concepts and influences which function sub-genre in Kpop. \n\nSome of the common concepts are; girl/boy crush, sexy, cute, summer, etc... \n\nEach group generally has a main theme and their Comebacks ,or songs that are the priority to promote and get award show *Wins* for, follow that general theme even while incorporating different concepts. Their B-Sides or non-promoted songs often have more variety and will deviate from the main theme of the group. \n\nFor this reason, it's kind of hard to say which group to start with. This is why some fans refer to Kpop as a rabbit hole or entertainment. You kind of have to just jump in and listen to a lot and not stick to only the biggest companies (known as the Big4; HYBE, SM, JYPE, YG)\n\nThere's generally no such thing as a bad group. Almost everything is very well produced. \n\nThese are some of my favorites (I kind of listen to Girl Groups most of the time)\n\n \n\nSoloists \n\nEyedi, Chung Ha, Sunmi, HyunA, BoA, Yezi, BIBI, Taeyeon, ChoA\n\nGroups\n\n2nd - 3rd Generation; Brown Eyed Girls, T-ARA, SISTAR, Girls Day, Red Velvet, Dreamcatcher, Spica, Weki Meki, CLC, Mamamoo etc... \n\n4th Generation; FIFTY FIFTY, IVE, LOONA, Billlie, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI listen to playlists often and just found [MELODYDAY](https://youtu.be/GEhDA13d4lQ) in this [one](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL27nFxqyoNA1HXAIqHPdMRaU37xqk3CsU).

It's a dark album and the vocals of the members really make them even better (exo is known purely as one of the best groups in the vocal department). \n\n- the war : more on the sexy side with songs such as the eve, touch it, kokobop, going crazy. Those songs are absolutely crazy! But there is more groovy songs like what u do ?. This album is really good too !\n\n- EX'ACT : probably my favourite. The title track lucky one is an rnb, disco song and it's in my top3 of my favourite exo TT. The production is insane on this one you should definitely check it out! I love this album because there are some of my favourite exo songs like artificial love, cloud 9, white noise and heaven. Those songs are beautiful and all different.\n\n- exodus : how can I not talk about the famous \"call me baby\"! This song is knows by all Korea along with growl which made exo popular today. Those are the EXO's songs you can't avoid at all, it's what made the boys who they are today. In this album you have playboy Which I adore personally (I guess you would know what kind of song it is ...) What If which is a more sentimental song (one of my faves btw). Amazing album too that you need to listen to you won't regret it at all:)!\n\nHonourable mentions to some songs : love me right = bright and fun funky song, tender love = same genre as love me right and finally the queen \"tempo\" ! This song is my favourite TT from exo because the production is like you've never seen, it's so well done but this song is famous for its bridge (check it out now XD!)\n\nNow we talk about EXO-CBX which is EXO sub unit made 2 of the 3 main vocals Baekhyun and Chen and one of their 2 lead vocals Xiumin. \nI recommend you to listen to their albums blooming day and hey mama ! Those are one my favourite albums ever ! The songs are bright and disco/funky. My favourite songs are blooming day, lazy, playdate, vroom vroom, Juliet and cherish ! \n\nI can't wait to hear what you think about these albums and songs I would be super happy if you could listen to them.

Some people get into a group because they like their sound, while others come across funny videos of them on social media and want to learn more about the group so they then go and check their music. \n\nThe people who recommended you go check a **Spotify playlist** are right. [K-pop ON!](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX9tPFwDMOaN1?si=si-TOEaFSSCARL0r4pSU4A&amp;utm_source=copy-link) has the most recent releases, but you'll find other playlists depending on what you're looking for.\n\nInstead of going through playlists, you could also **post here** about **what type of music you usually like to listen to**, or if you like certain songs from Blackpink and BTS and want to hear something similar. There are many groups with different sounds and some might fit your tastes better than others. \n\nIf you want to get into K-pop you should find something you like, if you want to learn about it in general and be a casual fan you should look up \"popular K-pop songs\" or \"top 100\" playlists. Learning more about the members or groups and watching fanmade content will give you more insight on what kpop or a certain group/fandom is all about. But beware, **for many of us it started with \"I just wanted to learn their names\"** \ud83d\ude02",

But if you wanna explore it in a more pop-cultural way some of my recommendations would be Twice and Stray kids, their music is easy to listen too, its fun and nice. You should also try the older classics like \"Candy\" by H.O.T, \"Gee\" by Girls Generation (also known as SNSD), \"I got a boy\" by Girls Generation, \"Touch my body' by Sistar, \"Mirotic\" by TVXQ, 'I'm the best\" by 2ne1, \"Fantastic baby\" by Bigbang, \"Replay\" by Shinee, \"Growl\" by EXO, \"Catallena' by Orange Caramel, \"Gagnam style\" by PSY (obviously haha), etc. These few songs are some of those that every single kpop fan should know in my opinion.",

Realistically, most westerners will only be familiar with those two groups, if any.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in modern *Korean* culture, then I\u2019d check out [various awards shows](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_MAMA_Awards) from the past few years and see what was nominated for Song of the Year, Album of the Year, and Artist of the Year. The truth is that most kpop isn\u2019t actually all that popular, even in Korea, so songs that have been nominated for awards will give you a good picture of what\u2019s actually culturally important. (Spoiler: it\u2019s still mostly BTS).\n\nIf you want *personal* recommendations, then that\u2019s a different story. But again, if your goal is to learn about the \u201cmodern cultural landscape,\u201d then your best bet is really mostly BTS.",

            "comment": "Hope this isn't too lengthy, but I love to give context so here you go:\n\nBTS was where I started with kpop, but in hindsight I feel like they got big because they stood out from the rest, having such personal lyrics. The style of their music soon became the standard that boy groups that came later would try to recapture though. If you want to listen to albums, go from The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever and You Never Walk Alone (this one is the most personal imo, everyone has a solo in it) to see what made them different.\n\nLove Yourself Answer is the point that made them explode, and also when you see them start to go a bit more mainstream. Map of the Soul 7 is kind of their victory lap, I find it sort of a retread of Love Yourself, even if I really like it. While not as outright pop as what followed, songs like Boy with Luv set the stage for their fully mainstream stuff like Dynamite and Butter.\n\nRed Velvet is the group that really got me into the wider world of kpop though. What I love about them is how easily they jump from concept to concept, usually sounding right out of different time periods too. Their name has a double meaning, with Red being bright pop and Velvet being empowering, alluring r&amp;b. This means they can follow up a fun summer track (Red Flavor) with a confident r&amp;b song about being stronger than any bad boy (Bad Boy).\n\nA lot of their albums tend to strongly feature one side or the other, but there's a mix more often than not. I lean towards Red tracks because that's usually when they let loose with their vocals, which they're known for. Some notable albums include: The Red, Perfect Red Velvet, The ReVe Festival Day 2 and The ReVe Festival 2022 - Feel My Rhythm.\n\nIf you want two songs to sample from each of these albums, I'd say go with:\n\nBTS:\n\n* Run\n* Silver Spoon\n* Mama\n* Spring Day\n* Idol\n* Airplane Pt. 2\n* Black Swan\n* ON\n\nRed Velvet:\n\n* Time Slip\n* Day 1\n* Bad Boy\n* Kingdom Come\n* Umpah Umpah\n* Eyes Locked, Hands Locked\n* Feel My Rhythm\n* In My Dreams\n\nI'd also recommend listening to these tracks and then watching the live performances. I find that watching them perform the songs really unlocks the whole rest of the experience.",

            "comment": "I would recommend starting with Seventeen! Today is their 8th anniversary as a group and I think a lot about them is just really Kpop if that makes sense lol\n\nFirstly their music! They tend to experiment and have evolved a lot throughout the years but still retain a signature sound. I think part of how they do this is because they're self-produced (the members heavily participate in composing, writing and producing songs and making choreography)\n\nKpop groups tend to release albums/EPs with a title track that they perform, promote, and is legible to revive awards. Here are some of seventeens title tracks, chronologically:\n\n[Adore U](https://youtu.be/9rUFQJrCT7M) (they started with \u00a35 and a dream \ud83d\ude2d)\n\n[Very Nice](https://youtu.be/J-wFp43XOrA)\n\n[Don't Wanna Cry](https://youtu.be/zEkg4GBQumc)\n\n[Clap](https://youtu.be/CyzEtbG-sxY)\n\n[Thanks](https://youtu.be/gZItyr1SNjU)\n\n[Fear](https://youtu.be/ap14O5-G7UA)\n\n[Left and Right](https://youtu.be/HdZdxocqzq4)\n\n[Home Run](https://youtu.be/UB4FzllQCyc)\n\n[Hot](https://youtu.be/gRnuFC4Ualw)\n\n[Super](https://youtu.be/-GQg25oP0S4)\n\nKpop usually focuses just as much on performance as it does music. Seventeen are known for their crazy intense choreos and synchronisation, so here are some of their performances/dance practices:\n\n[Super on MTV](https://youtu.be/MruIgj0yZNE)\n\n[Clap live in Japan](https://youtu.be/QqpuUz2TUB0)\n\n[Hit dance practice](https://youtu.be/loPVNjGkrz4)\n\nThey also have amazing vocalists and rappers! \n\n[Seventeen on Killing Voice](https://youtu.be/8ca0xEJH9wY)\n\nSubunits are also a thing in kpop, where some members of a group will form their own smaller group to release a few songs. Seventeen has:\n\n[SVT Leaders - Change up](https://youtu.be/6iCn6Qpy36k)\n\n[SVT Leaders - Cheers](https://youtu.be/RnO0HhILXi4)\n\n[BooSeokSoon - Just Do It](https://youtu.be/YGXiVHTy0JE) \n\n[BooSeokSoon - Fighting](https://youtu.be/mBXBOLG06Wc)\n\nA lot of Kpop groups also have variety shows! For many people, going from a causal listener of a group to becoming their fan depends on the members personalities. Seventeen's show, Going Seventeen, is immensely popular, to the point where some Kpop stans who aren't Carats (Seventeen fans) still watch it \n\nI would recommend [Seventeen Playground](https://youtu.be/XbNcsgEX2jc), [Insomnia Zero](https://youtu.be/89o7Ef7Qaq0), and [TTT Hyperrealism Ver](https://youtu.be/OjbjlNbQqLc) if you just want to check out a few episodes, but all episodes can be found in playlists [Going Seventeen 2020](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk_UmMfvZDx1Ug2GQ5NCijKz7Q3pmZLlT) and [Going Seventeen](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk_UmMfvZDx21Z9eEQ9DcIlUfZp1uwEup)on their youtube channel.\n\nThat's all I can think of to include for now, let me know if you have any questions! I think Seventeen is a great group to start off with because they really just have everything that makes Kpop what it is, from vocal/rap/dance to variety skills. They are also quite a large group so imo that takes away some of the initial fear of seeing really big groups in Kpop. Other groups I would recommend are TXT, Enhypen, and NCT Dream, and I can also write an essay on them if needed lol",

Here's [a playlist of their music](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcQBPa5r9M-qmhH4rcm11UYjADmGg3RXa) (their discography is short because they just debuted last year). If you like these songs I recommend checking out this [thread](https://twitter.com/irrisPROJECT/status/1650179156125032448?t=C0HAQbSKYzyFUw2qaEIO5Q&amp;s=19) to learn more about the members. And if you're looking for more music from them, they actually have 3/4 members who previously debuted in two groups together along w some side projects that contain music too. Link to all of that here! https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5hVa1mDNYvYKvcjz7No8Qa?si=EhVv60JwRYqNVXo9LbsDLg",

There\u2019s a huge variety of sounds in kpop even among the popular/active groups rn\n\nOtherwise, I agree with the other commenter that said just sticking with blackpink and BTS is fine if you just wanted to get familiar with the \u201cmodern cultural landscape\u201d of what most casuals would know/hear about without diving deep.\n\nI think the only other group to note right now is fiftyfifty because of how viral their song Cupid has gotten on tiktok, and now them being on the official Barbie movie soundtrack but that\u2019s more of a \u201ccurrent trends\u201d thing ig",

They also have a reality show called Wanteez. They are also some of the funniest boys, as well\n\nFor girl groups:\n\n you really can't go wrong with Twice, their content is also varied and their reality show has been going on a long time.\n\n(Smaller ggs include NMIXX, ViViz, g-idle they're very sweet and have a great sound)\n\nI think the key is to find sounds you like and then delve into getting to know the members of each group from there.",

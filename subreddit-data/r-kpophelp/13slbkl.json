    "postText": "Hello everyone! So I recently visited a Korean restaurant where I had super delicious food. In the background, they had KPop music videos playing with the audio. I have two questions I hope you can help me with!\n\n1. There was a music video where a single female singer (I believe it was more lofi music than pop) had gorgeous green hair and I want it! The music video showed her walking to her love interest's apartment and seeing a non-Korean woman with him, to which she ran out. What is the song and who is the artist?? Her hair was gorgeous! \n\n2. There was another music video playing and now the chorus of the song has been stuck in my head for days! I don't know any of the words or anything but the tune is stuck. I believe it was a girl pop band. There was one of the girls who was clearly an amazing dancer compared to the others. One of the girls had super light brown hair compared to the others who were all black haired.I am struggling trying to figure out how to upload my humming of the melody so have patience with me. \n\nAny assistance would be awesome!\n\nEdit: here's the link to what I remember from the melody https://voca.ro/1maI7lWJcAH7\n\nEdit 2: So number 2 is Hype Boy New Jeans! Shout out to u/SagetheAlchemist and u/kirklandbranddoctor for the help! Even if I didn't recognize it at first! \n\nCan anyone tell me about the first girl???",

Only green hair I remember ever seeing in kpop is [SinB from Gfriend](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8URtrz4cPMezAoQ-uvDFxT7_YpFPTM1hO-Rx45A3GuQILeR_1JnUr1qjCDJSO3n7t7kvi8bH9isKWt2RJbVbdGL_7kC8X0b_6g=w960-rj-nu-e365)\n2. **Newjeans - Hype boy** the part i think youre speaking about goes \"and we can go high i i i i i i i blablablabla bla blabla mmm mm take him to the sky y yy y y y y you know i hype you boyyeee\" brown haired girl would be Haerin whose pretty much main dancer the light hair on her and not the others is from [the mv where they're at a pool party](https://youtu.be/S4UEJePR0UE?t=124) . you'd get the amazing dancer part because she takes point in both chorus",

It doesn't help that the other music video looks very very similar to this lol. Basically the same style of music video with different clothes and color schemes, at least to me. Maybe it's this artist though!",

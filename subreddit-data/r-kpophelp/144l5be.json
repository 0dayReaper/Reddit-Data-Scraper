My guess would be that he was living in SK. If he were living in the U.S. when he tried to renounce at the age of 18, wouldn't that have been accepted?\n\nI think that \"a man born in a foreign country to South Korean parents with no intention to obtain permanent residency in that country\" means that the 23-yo man did **not** intend to permanently live in the U.S. So perhaps the court was sure that this man intended to live in South Korea, but claim U.S. citizenship to get out of military service. I'm guessing a bit at details that weren't clear in the article.\n\nHere is another write-up on citizenship from a law firm, with several hypothetical cases.\n\nhttps://pureumlawoffice.com/blog-updates/dual-citizenship-in-korea/",

I wonder where he was raised for most of his childhood? \n\nFrom what I have read elsewhere, living in the US with a clear intention to be a permanent resident in the US is important in these dual citizenship decisions. But if the birth was reported in South Korea, it may be hard to get out of conscription if the young man ever returns to South Korea while he is still of eligible age. Just from random reading.",

But they didn't want to leave him alone for 1.5 - 2 years, so they ended up just enlisting on their own time, making sure someone was with Peniel, which I think says something beautiful about their brotherhood \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99 \n\n(Someone correct me if I'm wrong)",

I added an example to make things a little more understandable.\n\nFelix and BangChan don\u2019t bc they both have Australian citizenships unless they do what 2PM Taecyeon did and revoke their Australian citizenships for their Korean citizenships.\n\nTaecyeon had an American citizenship(Permanent Residency) but revoked it bc I know there is something about not having dual citizenship in South Korea but I don\u2019t remember the circumstances where it\u2019s allowed. He revoked it to join the military so ig if Felix &amp; BangChan want to join the military they can make their Korean citizenship permanent.\n\nI\u2019m not a NCT Stan so I don\u2019t know about Mark and Johnny but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the same as Felix &amp; BangChan just different countries. \n\n**Edit:**\n\nUnless there was a change to enlistment rules (which I don\u2019t keep up with bc it\u2019s not that important to me) I\u2019m not sure if my comment is that accurate.",

You don't even get citizenship if you marry a korean, so... yeah. \n\nIf a korean moves away from Korea and refuses to serve, they will not be welcomed back to Korea. An older idol did this to escape military service and lives in America. He was stripped of his korean citizenship and banned from South Korea permanently because of it. It's a huge deal to not serve, which is why even if idols are pardoned for medical reasons, they usually serve as a public servant, like heechul of super junior. \n\nThat's also why it was dumb for fans to throw fits over bts \"being required to serve\". I can guarantee they would have served anyway, cause a man who doesn't serve is looked down on and disrespected.",

    "postText": "What I mean is, I\u2019m just confused on the whole styling process for idols\u2019 hair. \n\nWho decides what hair color/style they will have, are idols allowed to give their own input (generally speaking), how often do they get their hair styled? \n\nWe only see what info they give us on social media and ofc we can gauge how often they get styled by their comebacks, but I\u2019m more intrigued by what goes on behind the scenes for their hair. It seems like their hair go through a lot lmao.",

            "comment": "Most idols pick what they want, at least if they're not rookies.  There are exceptions since some groups have companies that have more control over their actions. Quite a few have said they were recommended colors by their stylists to fit with some of the concepts, but they do have their own salons they go to that they have chosen and pay for themselves so they have their own say over their hair (for the most part).\n\nFor example, Monsta X's Kihyun recently mentioned when he picks a color he just picks whatever he thinks looks nice that day and doesn't think too much of it. Then you have Minhyuk who cuts and dyes his own hair in the bathroom when he gets too bored and dyes his hair 3 times in one weekend because it's not the shade of pink he was imagining.\n\nYou'll also hear an idol mention to their own members they go to the same salon as another celebrity further establishing that not all of the members go to the same salon.",

Generally, idols get their hair done as often as they want... to the point they're scared that they might go bald LOL.\n\nIn MAMA 2012, G-Dragon walked the carpet with bleached hair. By the time he took the stage to perform, his hair was fire engine red. The dude had his hair done in the middle on an awards show!",

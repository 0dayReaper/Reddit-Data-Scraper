Title track most like this is [KISS](https://youtu.be/5UdoUmvu_n8) but [DOOM DOOM TA](https://youtu.be/QsuC2S2mdT0) is also great and has a more Latin flair to it. Also if you're from the US they're coming to tour here this month and they're great performers (check out their dance practices), so I highly recommend going if you can.",

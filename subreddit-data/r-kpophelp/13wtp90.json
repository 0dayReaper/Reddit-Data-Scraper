    "postText": "Ever since early 2021 all of Blackpinks old discog has had this high pitched frequency over the songs - I've been told it's to control the lightstick. Does anyone else still hear this like I do? It feels pretty awful that I straight up can't stream any of the blackpink songs I like on spotify without it being totally unlistenable. Will it ever be removed?",

I tend to avoid official BP audios because I swear it worse &amp; more noticeable there. Fan lyric videos never seem quite as bad.",

Sometimes \u201cmosquito\u201d sounds are used in public places to discourage kids from gathering there, and adults can\u2019t hear them. You can [check what frequencies you can hear](https://www.audiocheck.net/audiotests_frequencycheckhigh.php). (I\u2019m 31 and can only hear 16 kHz and lower.)",

Also check if your phone or listening device has equalizer settings, if it does, try playing around with it, I've found relief in that. Hope this helps a little!",
